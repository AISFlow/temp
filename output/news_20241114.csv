36312819,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=653108,1731623418,Solana ‚ÄòGod Candle Is Close‚Äô As It Breaks From Crucial Resistance ‚Äì Top Analyst,"Solana recently broke its yearly high at $210, sparking a surge in trading activity as the altcoin now attempts to consolidate above this key level. This period of volatile price action highlights Solana‚Äôs strong position within the market, as investors watch for signs of a further breakout. Top analyst and investor Immortal recently shared an insightful technical analysis comparing Solana‚Äôs chart to Bitcoin‚Äôs historical price movements, suggesting that Solana‚Äôs next breakout may be imminent. Related Reading: Bitcoin Weekly RSI Entering Power Zone ‚Äì Last Time BTC Soared 80% As the market reaches new highs, Solana‚Äôs ability to hold above $210 could indicate strength, drawing in additional interest from retail and institutional investors. In the coming days, Solana‚Äôs price action will likely clarify whether this consolidation phase is merely a pause before a more substantial move. With the broader crypto market reaching unprecedented levels, Solana is positioned at a critical juncture, and traders will closely monitor its performance for signs of a continuation of its upward trajectory. Solana Preparing For A Rally Solana appears poised for a significant rally, having broken out of an 8-month accumulation phase that began in March. This critical development has caught the attention of top analyst and trader Inmortal, who shared an analysis on X, comparing Solana‚Äôs recent chart patterns to those of Bitcoin. His technical perspective suggests that Solana mirrors Bitcoin‚Äôs past price movement and could be on the cusp of a substantial surge. Following its break above the yearly high of $210, Solana‚Äôs next target is likely to be its all-time high of $258. This level is viewed by many as a critical resistance, and a successful test could pave the way for even greater price gains. The breakout from such an extended accumulation phase has bolstered confidence in Solana‚Äôs bullish structure, and the market is closely watching for signs of sustained momentum. The timing of this potential move is also strategic. As Bitcoin consolidates just below its all-time high, a period of stability could provide the perfect window for altcoins, particularly Solana, to gain traction. This pause in Bitcoin‚Äôs rally allows liquidity to shift toward other strong projects, positioning Solana well for a possible continuation of its upward trend. Related Reading: Dogecoin Could Target $2.4 If Price Aligns With Macro Pattern ‚Äì Details The next few days will be pivotal for Solana as traders look to see if it can sustain support above $210. If Solana holds this level and momentum remains, a push toward the $258 all-time high could unfold rapidly, further solidifying its role as a leading altcoin in the market‚Äôs current bull phase. SOL Testing Last Supply Levels Before ATH Solana is currently trading at $220, having broken its yearly highs, yet it‚Äôs now encountering some volatility as traders assess the next move. With SOL just 17% away from its all-time high of $258, many are watching closely to see if it can sustain this momentum without giving traders any lower entry points. The $210 support level is particularly crucial in the coming days. If SOL fails to hold above this mark, a short-term correction could drive prices lower, potentially offering some breathing room for buyers looking to enter before the next rally. However, should SOL remain steady above $210, the likelihood of a rapid push to new highs becomes even stronger, as it signals ongoing bullish strength in a market eager for upward movement. Related Reading: Ethereum Weekly Volume Hits $60 Billion As ETH Aims For Yearly Highs As Solana continues to consolidate at these elevated levels, a decisive break could ignite a swift rally, drawing in both retail and institutional interest. Traders are preparing for either outcome: a brief correction as a buying opportunity, or a breakout that takes Solana into uncharted territory, setting new highs and reaffirming its place among top-performing altcoins this cycle.

42435328,xYK0rIu5vMPYEKIa4kozAY,1731622138,Ex-SEC Lawyers Agree: Crypto Enforcement Shackles May Take Time to Resolve,"The Securities and Exchange Commission may have to slowly drag itself out of the legal mire with the crypto industry, even with an industry-friendly commission.  Dropping existing cases would need a commission vote, lawyers say, and Republicans won't enjoy an SEC majority for a while.  Coinbase's top lawyer says it's still counting on rapid action from the regulator.  After years of legal wrangling with the U.S. securities regulator, President-elect Donald Trump's win was taken by the crypto industry as a definitive sign that their courtroom fights and enforcement pressures would be cast away when he takes the oath of office again.  But shedding the enforcement legacy of Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler is not quite that simple, according to former agency officials and lawyers interviewed by CoinDesk, some of whom now represent crypto clients.  While an incoming chairman appointed by Trump, a recent crypto convert, could effectively clear the decks of future enforcement actions, dealing with the many cases already being litigated is a stickier prospect. Turning the SEC ship could take several months into 2025 ‚Äî maybe longer. And even then, the lawyers say, dramatic case dismissals might not even happen.  What may be the most prominent of those outstanding federal cases is the SEC's battle with Ripple Labs, representing a high-profile dispute in which the agency accused the company of improperly offering unregistered securities. The chairman then was Jay Clayton, not the industry-loathed Gensler. And the president who appointed him? Donald Trump.  ""The reality is that the SEC's current approach to crypto really began under the last administration,"" said Ladan Stewart, a partner at White & Case who was a top enforcement lawyer at the SEC and led some of its big crypto cases.  ""Gensler gets a lot of heat in the press about the Ripple case, but that case was actually brought in the waning days of the Clayton SEC,"" Stewart said. ""In many ways, the SEC approach to crypto under Gensler is just a continuation of what the Clayton approach was.""  Read More: Gary Gensler's Contentious Reign Over Crypto Approaches Its Twilight  The agency will now have some questions to answer anew: Does the legal standard known as the Howey test properly account for crypto tokens as securities or not? Do crypto securities keep the securities label when they're traded on secondary markets, such as Coinbase Inc.? Will the SEC fall back on Howey to police bad behavior in the crypto markets that would remain out of its reach if it doesn't pin its securities tag on the involved assets?  On the first question, the agency has ‚Äî since Clayton ‚Äî viewed the basic business model of crypto platforms as a violation of securities law. Many tokens are securities, the agency has found, and they can't be legally traded if they and the exchanges aren't registered. That's at the heart of the Ripple case and the enforcement action against Coinbase (COIN). Unlike the SEC's more familiar Wall Street cases that usually don't pose make-or-break threats to the involved companies, this core question decides whether the most prominent crypto exchanges can move forward in the U.S. or not.  Are crypto tokens securities?  ""When I arrived in 2021, the commission under Chairman Jay Clayton had already brought some 80 actions, including the Ripple case, against participants in the crypto markets that were not following the common-sense rules of the road,"" Gensler said in a Thursday speech to the Practising Law Institute, noting that on his watch the agency ""has continued that vigilance.""  The agency, which didn't respond to a request for comment on its current legal strategy, has put the weight of its crypto position on a U.S. Supreme Court ruling known as Howey, which defines what makes an asset a security. So far, the agency has had a mixed record of crypto decisions in the frontline federal courts.  All of its cases asserted ""very strong claims of violation of law,"" noted Patrick Daugherty, a former SEC lawyer who now represents crypto clients at Foley & Lardner in Chicago. The agency likely needs to go back and take a close look at them one-by-one, he said, and ""each one has to be determined on its own merits.""  If nothing had changed, the cases would likely have landed in the Supreme Court's lap. But the return of Trump ‚Äî the self-declared ""crypto president"" ‚Äî will produce a new Republican leadership at the agency that is probably going to look more favorably on each of the major crypto cases.  ""In the most extreme case, they could simply dismiss,"" Daugherty said. But dumping the cases abruptly is ""a big ask and might not be justified.""  The alternative could be structured settlements in which crypto firms don't admit wrongdoing but agree to stay inside whatever guardrails the agency sets down.  ""Those things take a little bit of time to put together and do correctly,"" Daugherty said.  ""I do think that it would be foolish to expect any significant change on the very first day,"" said Paul Grewal, the chief legal officer for Coinbase, who has led the company's fight with the SEC. But he told CoinDesk he does expect Trump's team to move swiftly, despite the messy track record of his first term in the White House. ""I will gently disagree with those who suggest that this will take forever.""  Grewal's first choice is complete dismissal, but he suggested he's open to discussion.  Need a commission majority  On all the crypto cases, Anne Kelley, a longtime former SEC official who is now at Mercury Strategies, agreed that ""the SEC could vote to stop litigating or to settle ‚Äî maybe on the cheap,"" she told CoinDesk. ""But that decision can‚Äôt be made unilaterally by a chairman. It needs to be voted on by the commission.""  The problem for all of the major decisions ‚Äî dismissals, settlements and enforcement actions ‚Äî is that they can't be handled only by a new chairman and the senior legal staff he or she brings in.  At the federal appellate court level, for instance, the agency's general counsel supervises those matters, according to Tom Krysa, another former SEC enforcement lawyer who also works at Foley & Lardner in Denver. While that office may be able to pursue a stay (a formal delay) under the close watch of the chair's office, it would need the commission's majority approval to withdraw an appeal entirely.  If Trump promotes Republican SEC Commissioner Mark Uyeda to be acting chairman of the agency in January, as is widely expected, Uyeda would still only have one other Republican on the five-member commission for a time. Even if Gensler chooses to leave the agency entirely after his chairmanship, rather than stay to finish his term as a commissioner that ends in June of 2026, there are still two other Democrats there who can stand in the way of a pro-crypto shift.  While Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw's term expired in June, she's entitled to stay on until the end of 2025 or until she's replaced by a candidate who survives what can sometimes be a months-long confirmation process conducted by the U.S. Senate.  In the nearer term, what the agency can quickly change is how it's handling cases that haven't yet been brought or investigations still short of their conclusions.  Stewart's guess for the immediate future: ""We're not going to see registration-only cases"" like the ones that have plagued several prominent crypto firms.  Coinbase's Grewal said he assumes the new SEC will quickly begin conducting ""a careful separation of those cases that focus on fraud or scams"" from the ones that are more technical in nature ""but haven't resulted in any consumer harm whatsoever,"" such as the registration complaint against his company.  For his part, Commission Uyeda has said he favors a halt in new actions against crypto firms for registration violations while the regulator figures out that process.  ""We need to lay out some clear guidance and interpretations on what exactly falls within and falls outside of the securities laws,"" Uyeda was reported as saying.  John Reed Stark, a former SEC chief of the office of internet enforcement, said in a live session on X earlier this month that the crypto industry's weight has been felt and it'll probably get a very friendly SEC leadership. The eventual new enforcement director will be ""the most important of all the positions that the chair will pick,"" he said, and they'll look at all the crypto cases ‚Äî investigations and litigation ‚Äî and likely direct all the resources to the ""cases that involve egregious fraud"" and pull the plug on those that don't. So crypto enforcement wouldn't stop entirely, but its nature could shift.  ""It'll be a very important transition; a lot of money is at stake in these cases,"" Daugherty said. More than that, he said, ""the industry's future is largely at stake in the United States.""",NEUTRAL,ÏóÜÏùå,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/news-analysis/2024/11/14/ex-sec-lawyers-agree-crypto-enforcement-shackles-may-take-time-to-resolve,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3deb4b4a586a1d1bd6805f1e531a9743db3a16ef-3200x1800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The idea of strategic stockpiling isn't new, Saylor pointed out ‚Äî the government has made many of such moves in the past.  Although the idea that the United States should build a reserve of bitcoin {{BTC}} is currently merely a thought rather than a concrete plan, Michael Saylor thinks the proposal should ‚Äì and will ‚Äî get done.  In July, then presidential candidate Donald Trump assured a crowd of crypto enthusiasts at the Bitcoin 2024 conference that he would hold onto the current U.S. government holdings of roughly 200,000 bitcoin.  Shortly after, Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) went one step further and presented a bill that would add to the country‚Äôs existing holdings until it reaches one million tokens, purchased over a period of five years.  This would be the greatest deal of the 21st century, Saylor said during a presentation at the Cantor Crypto, Digital Assets & AI Infrastructure Conference in Miami on Thursday.  ‚ÄúThe best way to protect the dollar is make sure you retire the debt and become rich,"" said the MicroStrategy (MSTR) executive chairman. ""The next best way to protect the dollar is to make sure that if anybody ever considers a different capital asset other than the treasury bill, you own it,‚Äù he said. That asset is bitcoin, according to Saylor.  The idea of the U.S. buying strategic assets isn‚Äôt new, reminded Saylor, pointing to the acquisition of Manhattan, the Louisiana Purchase and the buying of California and Alaska in the 19th century. All resulted in multi-trillion dollar returns for the county, he said. There have also been several other strategic purchases made in the history of the nation like gold, oil, grain and helium, noted Saylor.  Saylor: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been done before, it‚Äôs a very simple idea: figure out where the value is going to be, go buy it cheap and hold it. You‚Äôre a nation, this is what nations do. ‚Ä¶ Bitcoin is manifest destiny for the United States.

36309325,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=653062,1731618046,"Solana Surges As Momentum Resumes, Is $240 the Next Stop?","Solana (SOL) is gaining momentum once more, with bullish energy pushing it higher as it aims for the next major resistance at $240. Following recent consolidations, SOL has surged onto traders‚Äô radars with renewed buying interest, sparking optimism that the climb will continue. With market sentiment turning increasingly favorable and technical indicators pointing toward further gains, all eyes are on SOL‚Äôs potential to break through its next significant threshold. Could this be the start of a rally that propels Solana to new heights? As bullish momentum builds, this article delves into Solana‚Äôs recent price action to evaluate whether its current upward trajectory has the strength to drive it toward the $240 mark. We‚Äôll assess SOL‚Äôs capacity to sustain its rally and reach this pivotal price target by analyzing key technical indicators, market dynamics, and support and resistance levels. Exploring The Factors Behind SOL‚Äôs Uptrend Solana is currently trading above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) on the 4-hour chart, a clear indication of upside strength. After experiencing a brief pullback to the $200 level, SOL has regained strength, with renewed buying interest pushing it toward the next key resistance at $240. This upward movement suggests that the bulls are in control, and if SOL can maintain its momentum, it could soon challenge and possibly break through the $240 level, opening the door to further gains. An analysis of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) reveals that the RSI has risen above the 50% threshold after dipping below it, signaling a shift in market sentiment. If the RSI continues to rise and stays above 50%, it points to the potential for more price growth and continued confidence in the price‚Äôs ability to gain. Related Reading: Solana Breaks Above Key Resistance ‚Äì Top Analyst Sets $300 Target Additionally, the daily chart reveals that Solana is experiencing strong upside movement, reflected in the formation of bullish candlestick patterns. With the asset trading above the key 100-day SMA, its positive trend is further validated. As SOL maintains this trajectory, it bolsters market confidence, setting the stage for more gains as it eyes the $240 target. Lastly, the RSI on the daily chart is at 71%, showing strong optimistic sentiment after recovering from a dip to 69%. This rebound indicates a resurgence in buying pressure, suggesting a shift toward a more positive market outlook. The RSI‚Äôs constant increase signals that the asset may maintain its upward trajectory, supporting the ongoing bullish trend and paving the way for additional gains. Can Solana Break Through Resistance On Its Path To $240? Solana is currently demonstrating strong bullish momentum, holding above the crucial 100-day SMA and recovering from recent pullbacks. As SOL advances toward the $240 target, a breakout above this level could trigger an extended buying pressure, propelling the price toward its all-time high of $260. Related Reading: Solana Market Cap Surpasses $100 Billion, Setting Up SOL For Potential ATH Rally However, failure to break above the $240 resistance could cause a decline, with the price targeting the $209 level and other support ranges further down.

Solana's high transaction volume, low fees, and robust protocol development give it strong long-term prospects, while Polkadot's fragmented user base and muted adoption present significant issues. Despite risks, we believe this trade could capture significant alpha in crypto markets. We rate SOL-USD a 'Buy' and DOT-USD a 'Sell'. Over the last two years, we've written hundreds of pieces of analysis , about stocks, funds, and options trading on regulated financial markets, with the goal of making you, the reader, money. Since starting, we're happy to say that we've been largely successful in doing just that . In that time, however, we've never written much about crypto; partially because folks here on SA enjoy primarily equities research, but also because getting involved in decentralized finance is a lot harder than simply opening a brokerage account. The world of crypto can be confusing to understand, and even harder to navigate. That said, in this article, we're breaking with tradition to write about an opportunity we think is too good to pass up. Here's the gist: Solana ( SOL-USD ), a leading blockchain, appears to be accelerating ahead of competitors. At the same time, legacy chain Polkadot ( DOT-USD ) appears to be falling behind the pack. This gives rise to a unique, partially hedged trade idea - Long SOL and Short DOT. Today , we'll explain our underlying valuation methodology for crypto (for those new to the space), dive into our reasoning behind the pair trade, and explain why we think now is a great time to put on this highly attractive exposure. Plus, we'll explain how to get started with a trade like this. Sound good? Let's dive in. Valuing Crypto In case you've never done anything in the crypto markets before, this section will serve as a quick orientation to the market so you can follow our trade logic in later sections. Essentially , the world of crypto exists as a parallel financial system to what we have currently. In the traditional system, we have currencies, assets denoted in currencies, transfer networks, banks, and functions like lending, borrowing, and trading. In Crypto, the currencies/assets are 'Tokens', the transfer networks are 'Chains', and a wide variety of 'on-chain protocols' allow users to swap, lend, and put their digital assets to work. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), the largest chain by market cap, doesn't have much of this 'extra' functionality, but many other, smaller chains have evolved to enable more complex financial use cases, with Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) being the largest, most recognizable alternative. Valuing crypto can be difficult, but as we see it, there are three main 'types' of tokens: Stablecoins Natives Asset Tokens Stablecoins are self-explanatory and are valued on their reserves of underlying USD or other 'real world' currencies. This includes tokens like USDC and USDT. Natives, like BTC, ETH, and SOL, are the 'gas' currency of the main blockchain that they live off of. That is, in order to interact with the chain, one needs to use the native currency in order to send transactions through. Finally, Asset Tokens can simply be thought of as 'on chain' investments - ways that one acquires something of utility in a tokenized form. This category includes things like Pepe ( PEPE-USD ) (whose value is speculative), but also things like Curve ( CRV-USD ), which entitles owners to a fraction of the profits from the underlying protocol's decentralized exchange operations. In the trade we're about to lay out, both tokens are Natives. Valuing Natives can be more complex than wrapping your arms around the growth of cash flows of a protocol (think: an on-chain 'company'), but it can also be more rewarding over the long run given chains' inherent economies of scale. When it comes to valuing a chain, it's best to think of it in the same way you'd think about an ecosystem or an economy. With that, we can head into our assessment of each. Long Solana Within Crypto, Solana is one of the most important chains around. The chain has a substantial amount of financial capital invested into on-chain protocols and utilities, and the userbase is significant: DefiLlama Solana currently ranks first in active addresses, second in TVL, and fifth in stablecoin TVL. It also ranks 9th in terms of total protocols, but TVL per protocol is among the best. Not only that, but trading and transaction volumes on the chain are also significant: DefiLlama As you can see, Solana ranks first in transaction volume and second in DEX TVL, which shows that the chain's protocols are effectively attracting and monetizing users at scale. Underlying these stats are best-in-class network performance, with low transaction fees for users and lightning-fast settlement in a minute or less. While there have been some network outages in the past, the Solana Foundation has been laser focused on improving network performance for decentralized use, which has paid off throughout the recent run we've seen. On a valuation basis, we'd argue that Solana has significant advantages as an ecosystem, which should drive the price of SOL (the native token) higher over the medium and long term. The key inputs to an economy are land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurship, as we discussed before. If we're judging a chain's prospects on this basis, then Solana has significant financial and human capital invested into the chain, building next gen apps on the underlying high throughput infrastructure (Land). On the entrepreneurship side, we've seen a significant pickup in protocol development, and the chain has one of the most vibrant and diverse protocol ecosystems, with multiple DEX, Lending, and Yield solutions competing for market share. Overall, we'd argue that Solana appears to be a healthy ecosystem with robust inputs for substantial long-term growth. The SOL token's tokenomics also appear conservatively dilutive, which shouldn't pose a long-term risk to investors. Short Polkadot Conversely, Polkadot appears to be in a much less attractive position. Structured a bit differently than Solana's simple 'spoke and node' model, DOT operates as a 'layer zero' network, offering shared security and interoperability to multiple individual chains operating on top of the core chain: Polkadot Wiki In theory, this technological layout should enable considerable value for DOT holders, 'parachains', and everyday users, but in reality, adoption of DOT has been muted. As we see it, DOT's long-term value comes from the competitiveness of the chains that use it as a 'base', but many of these parachains haven't been competitive when it comes to collecting financial capital, users, or developers: DefiLlama As you can see, SOL's total TVL and protocol count significantly dwarfs the collected strength of these many separate DOT parachains, and transaction amounts and user bases are also incredibly small by comparison. Not only that, but in the world of Crypto, users tend to cluster their activities on a few chains that they are comfortable with, which means that DOT's multichain layout actually splits up the user base and potential monetizability considerably. The shared security and interoperability benefits dim in comparison to the collected strength that SOL developers harness when they choose to develop there. Long story short, we think SOL is positioned incredibly well for the future, and DOT isn't. Each chain will continue to develop, but we don't see a world where further updates change the structural strengths and weaknesses with these chains. The Trade Thus, our trade idea - Long SOL, short DOT. Historically, this has been a pretty attractive way to allocate capital, up more than 1,240% since mid-2021: TradingView However, while the long-term trends and fundamentals appear sound, the recent election has given DOT an outsized boost, which has driven the pair's price down nearly 30% in the last two weeks: TradingView We see this price action as traders trying to scoop up the 'under loved' legacy plays that should benefit in an outsized way from a positive regulatory environment. This isn't to say that Solana won't also benefit from a more pro-crypto stance from the US government, but it isn't a core piece of the existing thesis. For chains like DOT with less positive catalysts on the horizon, it's a bigger deal. Thus, we see this dip being a short-lived drop that appears to be an attractive entry point into this long-term story. Tactically, if you're looking to enter into a long SOL short DOT position, the easiest way to do so is probably on Coinbase ( COIN ), going long SOL in a spot format and shorting the DOT futures on the derivatives platform there. Carrying costs of this trade are low, so it's an efficient venue to consider. If you'd prefer to conduct the trade 'on chain', then heading to Thena's Alpha perpetual futures exchange (or a similar provider) could be a good option. Risks There are some risks with a trade idea like this. First off, there is no generally accepted method for valuing digital assets, which makes fundamental analysis less precise than it otherwise would be in traditional finance. We've analyzed the chain's respective ecosystems and potential strengths, but DOT's recent outperformance may continue for the foreseeable future, despite our conviction in the token's underlying quality. Secondly, in the event that we enter a 'crypto winter', DOT's 'lower beta' profile means that it would likely lose less in overall value than SOL, which could cause losses to investors in this trade. Finally, volatility in the crypto sphere is quite high relative to traditional equities. We'd advise caution and sizing down until you're more comfortable with the types of swings and volatility you might experience on a day-to-day basis. Summary However, while there are risks, we think going Long SOL and short DOT could be a simple way to capture alpha in the crypto markets in a somewhat-hedged way. While we can't be sure that the time is perfect for an entry into this trade, we have long-term conviction in our thesis and expect that investors into a position like this should be rewarded over the medium and long term. Thus, our respective ratings.

The firm will buy validators of Solana {{SOL}}, Sui {{SUI}}, Monad {{MONAD}} and ARCH {{ARCH}} networks from Cogent Crypto, with most dollars focused on SOL. Validators are entities that process transactions and help maintain the security of proof-of-stake blockchains, such as Solana and Ethereum, by staking or pledging certain amounts of the network's cryptocurrencies. Essentially, validators work like miners on a proof-of-work blockchain, such as Bitcoin.  Sol Strategies has been actively investing in the digital assets sector for several years and has various investments, including Animoca Brands. The company shifted its strategy from just investing in digital assets to Solana after hiring Leah Wald to provide investors with exposure to indirectly participate in staking rewards and Solana-based projects. The company recently said it holds about 130 million SOL, worth C$32.2 million ($22.9 million).  Read more: Ex-Valkyrie CEO Leah Wald to Take Reins of Crypto Investment Firm Cypherpunk  The Solana network, which hosts numerous meme coins, has recently started to catch institutional investors' interest. The layer 1 blockchain saw many giant financial institutions, such asFranklin Templeton,Citibank andSoci√©t√© G√©n√©rale, announce new Solana-based projects last September during Breakpoint, the network‚Äôs biggest yearly conference.  ""This acquisition will meaningfully expand Sol Strategies' staking capabilities, which underpins Solana‚Äôs reputation as a next generation blockchain for institutional and decentralized applications alike,"" said Leah Wald, CEO of Sol Strategies.  The shares of the investment firm rose more than 900% this year, while Solana rose 113%, according to TradingView data.

36305975,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=653083,1731612658,"Crypto Analyst Predicts Major Price Crash For Shiba Inu, But It‚Äôs Not All Bad News","Crypto analyst MadWhale has predicted that the Shiba Inu price could suffer a significant crash soon enough. Based on the analysis, this price correction is simply a healthy retracement that could pave the way for SHIB to reach new highs. Shiba Inu To Suffer A Major Price Crash In a TradingView post, MadWhale predicted that Shiba Inu could suffer a major price crash soon enough. According to the analyst, SHIB could decline further to the next lower Fibonacci support level. The analyst‚Äôs accompanying chart showed that this Fib support level is just above the psychological price level of $0.000020. Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Price Reach $1 By Year End? Here‚Äôs What The Fibonacci Levels Say However, the analyst is still bullish on Shiba Inu in the long term despite the possibility of this price crash. MadWhale stated that they anticipate a renewed upward movement following the potential dip, leading to a price recovery and subsequent price increases. The accompanying chart showed that the Shiba Inu price could rally to $0.00003200 on the first leg of this recovery. MadWhale also provided insights into why they are bullish on Shiba Inu‚Äôs long-term trajectory. The analyst stated that a significant influx of trading volume has entered the market for SHIB. Furthermore, they claimed that the meme coin is backed by one of the largest media platforms and communities in the global crypto space, which enhances its influence and market visibility. A price correction also seems likely for Shiba Inu, especially if the Bitcoin price were to correct following its recent parabolic rally past $90,000. IntoTheBlock data shows that the Shiba Inu price correlation with Bitcoin is at 0.91, which indicates a strong positive price correlation between both assets. Moreover, Shiba Inu‚Äôs recent rally has also been thanks to the parabolic rally that the Dogecoin price has enjoyed, given their price correlation. Therefore, with crypto analysts like Kevin Capital predicting that DOGE will witness a price drop soon, SHIB could also follow suit. SHIB Could End The Year At $0.0000444 In an X post, crypto analyst Investing Haven predicted that Shiba Inu could rise to $0.0000444 by year-end. The analyst stated that this price target aligns with the 25% Fibonacci retracement. Furthermore, Investing Haven noted that October‚Äôs predicted dip to $0.0000144 saw buyers step in at $0.0000158, reinforcing a bullish setup. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price To $20? Higher Montly Close Suggests 8,000% Run Is Possible Meanwhile, Investing Haven also stated that Shiba Inu‚Äôs strength signals an ultra-bullish 2025. The analyst‚Äôs accompanying chart showed that SHIB could rally to $0.00007436 sometime next year. This target is still below Shiba Inu‚Äôs current all-time high (ATH) of $0.000088. However, crypto analyst Javon Marks predicted that SHIB would still rally to its ATH and surpass it. At the time of writing, Shiba Inu is trading at around $0.00002642, up over 11% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

42435317,xYK0rIu5vMPYEKIa4koz2Q,1731609126,How Tokenized Money Market Funds Dulled the Stablecoin Star,"It‚Äôs been a banner year for the stablecoin market ‚Äì 11 straight months of inflows and an all-time market cap of $171 billion. Everyone‚Äôs jumping in, even the industries stablecoins threaten to disrupt.  Visa recently launched a platform to help banks issue stablecoins and use them across its network, with Spanish bank BBVA as one of its first takers. PayPal‚Äôs PYUSD, launched in 2023, recently reached a $1 billion market cap and recently executed its first business payment via stablecoin. Revolut is rumored to be launching its own stablecoin, and Stripe just struck a $1.1 billion deal with a major stablecoin platform.  This is in part because stablecoins have proven incredibly useful, and lucrative for issuers. They serve as a stable store of value, means for payments and commerce particularly for remittances, trading collateral, and trade settlements between traditional finance and blockchain networks. The underlying holdings of stablecoins, often U.S. treasuries or other short-term fixed income holdings, pay the issuers consistent yields.  While Tether and Circle pocket these profits, new and innovative market entrants are passing yields onto users to capture market share.  Ethena Labs launched in February 2024 on the promise of returning consistent yield through its stablecoin sUSDe. It delivered, and has amassed more than $1.2 billion in market cap. Others followed, such as Mountain Protocol and Paxos International, which also seeks to pass along the yield from underlying holdings directly to users. BitGo‚Äôs recent introduction of USDS and the Global Dollar Network‚Äôs USDG promise to spread ‚Äúrewards‚Äù across their ecosystems.  Despite the attractiveness of this innovation, yield-bearing stablecoins are restricted in most major financial hubs, such as the U.S., because they are almost certainly securities operating outside of regulatory oversight.  This regulatory impasse has paved the way for a new class of competitors that threatens to overtake stablecoins: tokenized yield-bearing instruments like money market funds. These on-chain products, regulated by the SEC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, offer the same advantages as stablecoins ‚Äî stable value, ease of transfer, and utility in settlements ‚Äî while also providing steady returns through investing in U.S. treasuries, bonds, and cash-equivalents.  Leading asset managers BlackRock and Franklin Templeton are early movers into this space, having launched tokenized money market funds that to date have amassed nearly $1 billion in assets. More are to come, with State Street working on a tokenized bond and money market fund.  Now, BlackRock is advancing its money market fund and BUIDL token to be used as collateral for derivatives trading on DeFi exchanges. The benefit over stablecoins for this purpose is clear, as traders can continue to earn yield while posting BUIDL as collateral. This raises the question: Are stablecoin issuers fighting over a market that has already moved on?  The market opportunity for tokenized money market funds as a collateral source is currently confined to DeFi, which is estimated to reach $48 billion by 2031 according to IBS Intelligence. In comparison, the U.S. equity market cap alone is over $50 trillion, based on data from the World Federation of Exchanges (WFE) and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA).  Clearly, the real prize for these financial instruments lies in their application within traditional financial markets as they evolve from electronic to digital.  Achieving this, however, requires significant advancements in the underlying market infrastructure to enable the widespread use of tokenized funds as stablecoin proxies or sources of collateral. Currently, BlackRock's and Franklin Templeton's products operate within closed networks, available to select investors, with limited interoperability across different blockchain platforms.  Unlocking the full value of tokenized funds demands a public market infrastructure that can support the seamless trading, settlement, clearing, and custody of digital asset securities. The absence of a comprehensive market structure in the U.S. that supports the full lifecycle of digital asset securities trading is limiting access of these yield-bearing instruments to broader financial markets ‚Äî for now.  As regulated, yield-bearing tokens backed by financial giants gain traction and market infrastructure evolves to support them, stablecoin issuers may find themselves fighting for a shrinking market. Tokenized money market funds offer not just stability and liquidity but also regulatory oversight and steady returns ‚Äî qualities that could redefine the digital asset landscape and leave traditional stablecoins struggling to keep up.

Tether's goal with the new platform is to unlock ""alternative financing and capital markets opportunities for nation states and corporations,"" according to a blog post.

""Our goal is to create new opportunities for businesses and governments, while also making the digital asset space more accessible and transparent.""  Tether's ambition to venture into asset tokenization, a red-hot trend at the intersection of crypto and traditional finance, has been well-documented as the company strives to diversify from its highly-profitable stablecoin business.

It has used the profits to invest in startups, bitcoin mining, energy production and AI.  Tokenization is potentially a multi-trillion industry, as global banks and digital asset companies race to bring traditional financial instruments onto blockchain rails pursuing more efficient, transparent and cheaper operation.  Ardoino first outlined plans for Tether's tokenization platform in April. The firm also invested $100 million in a Latin American agricultural firm that was a founder and partial owner of agricultural commodities tokenization startup Agrotoken.

42435321,xYK0rIu5vMPYEKIa4koz4E,1731604368,"The Post Web: Read, Write, Own, Delegate","Web3‚Äôs failed decade  In the past week, the markets have seen a huge turnaround. Now is the time for founders and builders to look to the future to the next stage of Web3.  The convergence of AI x Crypto and the subsequent explosion of agents on blockchains, we propose, means we are evolving from not ‚ÄúRead, Write, Own‚Äù to ‚ÄúRead, Write, Own, Delegate,‚Äù creating a new internet paradigm we call The Post Web.  We are moving from the era of the ‚ÄúAttention Economy,‚Äù where internet properties compete for our mindshare, to the ‚ÄúIntention Economy,‚Äù where agents work to optimally solve our intentions, forming an unprecedented market super cycle.  How did we get here?  Powered by innovations in social media, we went from passively reading to actively writing and contributing to the internet. Then Web3 allowed us to also finally own digital assets and unbundle Web2‚Äôs powerful platforms.  Buttoday, even with markets picking up, just 5% of the global population uses crypto, and just 1% of internet users (those we assumed would be Web3‚Äôs early adopters) use DeFi or DApps at all.  In effect, the majority of us still very much live, work, shop and play in Web2, where attention is the fundamental unit of value. Today‚Äôs internet is optimised by powerful algorithms that capture, package, and sell data to advertisers seeking to convert it into e-commerce spend.  So why has Web3 seemingly failed to be adopted?  Ultimately, despite several years of abstraction, Web3 still isn‚Äôt usable for the majority of the people. And that isn‚Äôt for lack of trying. But, after reflection, its innovations aren‚Äôt really about the Web at all. Far from being a new and improved user interface for people to use the internet, it is instead a series of lower-order functionality laying dormant. You could say it‚Äôs a sleeping giant, waiting for an actual Web interface that can unlock its potential and make it usable for the average person.  In parallel, we‚Äôve seen advances and adoption of AI. From large language models (LLMs) to agentic networks, they have shown that user interfaces can become more intuitive and handle greater task complexity.  It's now becoming clear that to unlock Web3‚Äôs full potential, we require LLMs as a more intuitive and natural language front-end interface. Agentic networks then can carry out complex backend behaviours on-chain via intents-based-architectures, whether signing transactions or bridging and swapping between different networks. In other words, crypto and AI are convergent and highly complementary technologies.  What if Web3 wasn‚Äôt for people to use directly at all? What if its innovations are a new set of internet protocols for machines to manage our digital things and lives, where work and much of the consumer internet are delegated to them on our behalf?  AI needs real economic agency  Today, LLMs like ChatGPT can advise you on a task but can‚Äôt be trusted to execute it. It can‚Äôt book a holiday, set up a bank account, or sign a new mobile phone agreement. For this, they need adaptive agents and contracting capabilities.  For agents to in fact have full agency, they need a new deterministic yet adaptive computing paradigm; an internet optimized for machines, with machine-readable smart-contracts and machine money for peer-to-peer, or, in fact, agent-to-agent, economic exchange.  For over a decade, the intersection of Web3 and AI has fascinated myself and Outlier Ventures, the global accelerator I founded a decade ago.  We've been theorizing about the convergence of AI and blockchains since 2016, publishing several papers and making the industry's first decentralised AI investment (an early-stage startup called Fetch.AI ‚Äî the first decentralised protocol designed specifically for agents. That projet has gone on to merge with several other leading DeAI projects ( including Ocean and CUDOS) to become $ASI.  Fast-forward to the present day. There are now over 195 startups at this AI-crypto intersection, and it has become one of the hottest categories of 2024, with a combined market cap of $28 billion. Almost every major Layer One protocol is now positioning themselves for agents from Ethereum to NEAR, TAO and ICP.  Underpinned by real-world demand for AI, DeAI and its close cousin DePin, this new generation of services promises to create a new category of digital assets based on actual fundamentals of supply and demand. This will create a new super cycle that will define the next major bull run. Whilst it's unlikely they can escape cryptos volatility entirely at first, they should have natural floors due to protocol income streams that should insulate its token economies.  From Read to Write to Own to Delegate  In this context, we can look at a decade of Web3 as a battle hardening of a human-tested stack of distributed architecture and incentive games from smart contracts, token economics, DAOs and DeFi. While too complex for people themselves to operate at scale, the stack is primed for AI and the agentic internet.  But most importantly, the consequence of the convergence process isn't just another iteration of the Web ‚Äî it's the disappearance of the web as we know it. As the internet becomes optimized for agents, they simply don‚Äôt need these layers of the Web. They can bypass human shortcuts for the best outcome.  It represents the death of search, interruptive advertising, a website or an app for everything, and, in fact, the app store itself.  This means a wholesale unbundling of business models based on the attention economy as a whole ‚Äî first slowly and then all at once.  This is the transition from the attention economy to the intention economy, where the agentic internet assembles to optimally solve your needs through intent-based architectures. It is deterministic yet adaptive, verifiable and hyper contextual. When you optimize for intention over attention, you get minimally extractive value chains and maximally optimised outcomes.  DeAI‚Äôs universe of possibility now offers an exciting alternative pathway towards AI‚Äôs nirvana, artificial superintelligence, one hopefully based on Web3's principles of user sovereignty, open-source collaboration, security and modularity.  We have spent hundreds of hours talking with founders across our network and portfolio of close to 400 startups to distil down this future into a formal thesis and serialised audio documentary, to be released over the coming weeks. We hope to help the industry prepare and navigate the process of convergence and a Post Web future.  Join us to explore The Post Web.

36299529,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=653088,1731601855,Bitcoin Trader Unrealized Profit Margins At High Levels ‚Äì Risk Of Correction?,"Bitcoin set a new all-time high yesterday, reaching $93,483, continuing its impressive rally without significant setbacks. Over the past nine days, the crypto leader has surged with minimal dips, not falling more than 5% during this bullish phase. This relentless price action has drawn widespread attention as Bitcoin defies expectations and resists any notable pullback. Related Reading: Chainlink Whales Waking Up ‚Äì Data Shows Signs Of Accumulation Key data from CryptoQuant reveals that traders‚Äô unrealized profit margins are climbing, indicating that the market may be nearing a short-term peak. High unrealized profit levels typically signal that a correction could be on the horizon as investors look to secure gains. However, given the current strength of Bitcoin‚Äôs price action, the timing and scale of any correction remain uncertain. With Bitcoin‚Äôs price momentum showing few signs of slowing down, the coming days will be crucial in determining whether the market can sustain these levels or if a healthy retrace is in store. Investors are closely watching for potential entry points and key support levels, knowing that even minor dips could trigger strong buying interest as Bitcoin‚Äôs bullish phase persists. Bitcoin Strong Move About To Pause? Bitcoin‚Äôs price action has been remarkable, surging 38% since the U.S. election and capturing widespread attention with its unrelenting bullish momentum. However, this aggressive rally may be approaching a temporary pause, as data hints at a potential correction. CryptoQuant‚Äôs head of research, Julio Moreno, recently shared a compelling chart highlighting Bitcoin traders‚Äô unrealized profit margins, which have reached 47% ‚Äî a level that has often preceded price pullbacks. High unrealized profit margins can indicate that traders are sitting on significant gains, raising the likelihood of profit-taking that could trigger a market cooldown. Moreno‚Äôs analysis notes that this metric tends to correlate with a heightened risk of a correction when it surpasses certain thresholds. For instance, prior peaks in March reached 69%, while December 2023 saw unrealized profits hit 48%, both instances that led to notable corrections shortly after. Still, the current 47% level suggests that, while caution may be warranted, Bitcoin‚Äôs bullish phase still has room to run. Past cycles demonstrate that the market has tolerated even higher unrealized profits before reversing. The data implies that while a pullback may be on the horizon, Bitcoin could continue its upward trend a bit longer before any significant cooling occurs. Related Reading: Dogecoin Could Target $2.4 If Price Aligns With Macro Pattern ‚Äì Details In the coming days, investors will be watching closely for any signs of a consolidation phase or a potential retracement. Should Bitcoin maintain strong support levels, continuing this bull run remains plausible. However, if profit-taking intensifies, a correction could provide a healthy reset for Bitcoin to gather momentum for future gains. BTC Breaking ATH Almost Every Day Bitcoin has shattered its all-time high seven times over the past eight days, fueling a highly bullish sentiment across the market. Currently trading at $90,620 after peaking at $93,483, Bitcoin‚Äôs price action remains strong, signaling sustained buying momentum. This surge has set a notably optimistic tone, but a brief correction period could provide a necessary reset after such an extended upward push. Given the high buying pressure, a short-term pullback to establish a new market equilibrium would be a healthy development. This could allow Bitcoin to test lower demand levels and establish stronger support areas for its next leg up. If profit-taking intensifies in the near term, BTC could revisit the $85,000 mark as it seeks to stabilize. Related Reading: Bitcoin Weekly RSI Entering Power Zone ‚Äì Last Time BTC Soared 80% In the coming days, investors will likely watch for this potential consolidation phase to gauge Bitcoin‚Äôs resilience. A successful retest of support around $85,000 would reaffirm confidence in the ongoing bull market, providing a stronger foundation for Bitcoin to push toward even higher levels. Overall, while the trend remains bullish, a balanced correction may be just what the market needs to maintain its momentum over the long term.

42435338,xYK0rIu5vMPYEKIa4kozHm,1731600000,Crypto for Advisors: Post-Election Review,"In today‚Äôs issue, Paul Veradittakit from Pantera Capital reviews bitcoin‚Äôs price and the optimism around regulations since the U.S. election.  Then, Eric Tomaszewski from Verde Capital Management answers questions about how these changes could impact advisors in Ask an Expert.  Thank you to our sponsors of this week's newsletter, L1 Advisors.  ‚ÄìSarah Morton  You‚Äôre reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk‚Äôs weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.  A Week After the Election: Can Optimism Lead to Wider Adoption?  A week after the election, crypto sentiment remains strong. Polymarket, bitcoin and a possibly more efficient and crypto-positive government are all tailwinds to look forward to.  Polymarket  Polymarket, a predictions market built on the Polygon blockchain, saw an explosion of usage leading up to the election, peaking at over $3.2 billion bet on the election, orders of magnitude more than pre-election volumes. Compared to other prediction markets, Polymarket charges no fees, allows seamless trading in and out of positions and is decentralized, meaning anyone can trade directly with the underlying contracts on-chain via the API (allowing for anyone to make trading bots) and anyone from a non-blacklisted geography can access the website frontend.  Polymarket Open Interest  Though open interest has dramatically fallen post-election, there is a belief that mainstream users have both tried and enjoyed using Polymarket over any centralized entities. One definite win post-election is the discussion of Polymarket‚Äôs accuracy by the mainstream media. The Economist, The Wall Street Journal, Forbes, and more have cited Polymarket as the largest prediction market and have used it to judge discrepancies between polls and voting sentiment before and after the election.  Hopefully, Polymarket‚Äôs enthusiasm permeates into the broader crypto ecosystem and also inspires more crypto apps to take from Polymarket‚Äôs playbook in the pursuit of better usability, abstraction and marketing.  Bitcoin and altcoins  Bitcoin is at an all-time high of over $87,000, pumping to $77,000 right after the election and rising ever since. Altcoins tangentially related to the election also surged, like those on Solana. The Trump Presidency does not directly lead to greater bitcoin buy pressure, but his public support of it was enough to cause a rally in these coins.  Looking forward  Positive headwinds in crypto caused by the election itself may not be as sticky in a month. However, the ramifications of a unified Republican House and Senate majority may mean a more productive government, and one that passes more legislation surrounding crypto.  Crypto election updates from StandWithCrypto  Significantly more pro-crypto than anti-crypto representatives across both sides of the aisle have been elected (266 vs. 120 in the house, 18 vs. 12 in the senate). And pro-crypto Trump may be lighter on crypto regulation or will push crypto-supporting regulation. World Liberty Financial is a crypto project being promoted by Trump and says it will run as an Aave instance (one of the largest DeFi protocols).  What does this mean going forward? First, it may mean lobbying efforts, like those from Ripple and Coinbase, may increase in order to push the wording of crypto regulation in one direction or another.  It is believed that U.S. regulation has been unclear, and clarity would drastically change the thinking around operating in the U.S. The largest crypto venture capital firms are largely still based in the U.S., so allowing the companies that are funded to operate in the country could supercharge the industry, supporting the domestic crypto market.  There has also been excitement from top DeFi protocols like Compound and Uniswap surrounding previously ‚Äúoff-limit‚Äù protocol features, like staking, fee-switches and more. Adding regulatory clarity around these features may cause firms to innovate on DeFi protocols.  Overall, I am very optimistic about the direction the crypto industry is heading, especially post-election. A unified House and Senate may bring unexpected wins in an ever-changing industry.  - Paul Veradittakit, managing partner, Pantera  Ask an Expert  Q: Could blockchain-based prediction markets redefine participation in elections?  Yes. Many people are frustrated with the media‚Äôs pageantry, preferring straightforward results.  Prediction markets could increase engagement, particularly among younger, tech-savvy individuals who prefer data-driven insights similar to stock market updates, without media-driven narratives.  Q: What does the election mean for crypto and blockchain tech?  Bitcoin‚Äôs rise past $80K reflects optimism and a renewed excitement for the USA to lead the evolution of the space.  A Republican-led Congress could advance pro-crypto legislation. Beyond that, we could see shifts in regulatory oversight, executive actions that create leadership changes and strategic initiatives, etc.  Q: How does a financial advisor view prediction markets?  Prediction markets provide diverse, aggregated opinions and constantly updated probabilities, enhancing information efficiency. This can support decision-making for clients by offering timely insights. The benefits of information are more opportunities to simplify messages for clients while adding value.  - Eric Tomaszewski, financial advisor, Verde Capital Management  Keep Reading  BlackRock IBIT bitcoin ETF broke records on the U.S. election day, with over $4 billion traded.

Solana (SOL) has recently shown impressive market resilience, reaching a local peak of $225 before a slight pullback. At the time of writing, SOL traded at $216, reflecting a 1.23% increase over the past 24 hours. Over the last seven days, the token has surged by 15.15%, fueling speculation about its potential to surpass its all-time high. Analysts and traders are monitoring the situation closely, offering varying predictions for the token‚Äôs next moves.Solana Potential Bullish ContinuationA technical analyst on TradingView identified a cup and handle formation on Solana‚Äôs long-term charts. This pattern, which began forming in late 2021, saw SOL's price drop below $10 during the bear market. The subsequent recovery in 2023 brought the token to its current levels. SOLUSD TradingView Following the formation of the cup, SOL entered a consolidation phase, characterized by a descending wedge that forms the handle. Historically, this structure indicates bullish continuation, especially on monthly timeframes. The analyst suggests that a breakout could propel Solana‚Äôs price to between $400 and $500.More Conservative OutlookWhile long-term charts hint at significant gains, short-term predictions offer a more cautious view. A prominent analyst on X, Satoshi Flipper, highlighted a bullish channel on the hourly chart.¬†This pattern suggests that SOL could climb to $260, a target associated with a pennant breakout. Beyond that, the token might test new all-time highs.¬†Meanwhile, another analyst, operating under the pseudonym Bitcoin Buddha, highlighted Solana's strong performance on the weekly charts and described its current trajectory as highly bullish. He noted that memes coins on the Solana network are now generating over $1 billion in daily trading volume, a bullish sign for Solana. Amid this, he noted that Solana will remain his top pick for this cycle.Increased Market ConfidenceBeyond technical analysis, Solana‚Äôs staking metrics indicate strong network confidence. Data from analytic platform Dune shows a consistent recovery in staked SOL. The total value of staked SOL in USD surpassed $81 billion, while the token count stabilized at around 407 million.

However, Armstrong also expressed serious doubts regarding the platform‚Äôs long-term sustainability, citing concerns about its growth potential and increasing competition within the blockchain ecosystem.While acknowledging the recent surge in ADA's price , Armstrong noted that investors are likely to see gains. However, he cautioned that Cardano may not offer the same high returns possible in other projects like Render or Internet Computer (ICP). ‚ÄúPeople holding ADA are going to make money, just not as much as they would with other coins,‚Äù Armstrong remarked. Notably, Cardano made headlines earlier this week when it attempted to break its yearly high. For context, ADA traded as low as $0.3214 on November 4, but just one week later, it was trading in the $0.50 range. The momentum continued, and ADA eventually broke a seven-month high, reaching $0.65 ‚Äî a 102% increase from the November 4 low.Despite this comeback, Armstrong maintained his long-standing pessimism about Cardano. In his latest comments, he referred to Cardano as ‚Äúa dying platform‚Äù with an uncertain timeline for decline.BitBoy Insists Cardano, Polkadot, and Ethereum are ‚ÄúDying Platforms‚ÄùWhen comparing Cardano to other blockchain platforms, Armstrong also voiced skepticism about Polkadot (DOT), calling it ‚ÄúDead on Arrival.‚Äù He criticized Polkadot‚Äôs growth model, labeling its past hype unsustainable and suggesting that the platform‚Äôs initial surge was a little more than a ‚Äúpump and dump‚Äù scheme.Armstrong also scrutinized Ethereum (ETH). While he predicted its longevity among institutions, he speculated that it might lose its appeal to retail investors. Armstrong even suggested that XRP could eventually surpass Ethereum in market value, pointing out the lack of retail-focused decentralized application (dApp) development on the Ethereum network.Cardano May Still Hit $5 ‚Äî BitBoyDespite his critical view on Cardano‚Äôs future, Armstrong did leave room for optimism, stating that ADA could hit the $5 mark in the short term. He estimated a likely top between $2.50 and $3.50 but didn‚Äôt rule out the possibility of a higher peak if market momentum continues. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll have to wait and see,‚Äù he concluded, leaving ADA investors with both a warning and a glimpse of potential upside in the months ahead.",NEGATIVE,ADA | DOT | ETH,ADA | BUSINESS | DOT | ETH | MARKET,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/14/bitboy-says-5-possible-for-cardano-but-insists-its-is-a-dying-platform/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=bitboy-says-5-possible-for-cardano-but-insists-its-is-a-dying-platform,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

CLSK's Bitcoin accumulation strategy and institutional backing, including increased stakes from BlackRock and Vanguard, highlight its financial stability and long-term growth potential. Recent acquisitions, infrastructure development, and a merger with GRIID position CLSK to achieve a 50 EH/s target by 2025, enhancing operational capacity. Despite recent share dilution, CLSK's undervaluation and correlation with Bitcoin's price suggest substantial upside potential, with analysts projecting a price target above $20. CleanSpark Inc. ( CLSK ) is positioned as one of the leading players among Bitcoin miners, demonstrating consistent growth in financial capacity, energy efficiency, aggressive expansion efforts, ongoing acquisitions, and a strong operational footprint. Though CLSK's road to long-term success has been supported by an increased focus on dilution, this company has increased institutional backing, and now a clear path to capitalizing on the upward rise of Bitcoin's price. At current price levels, CLSK still presents an opportunity for investors looking to tap into Bitcoin and the larger digital asset ecosystem. Let's dive in with the CLSK‚Äôs operational updates, their plans going forward, and why this stock presents significant upside potential. Is CLSK Continuing to Sustain a Strong Bitcoin Accumulation Strategy? Key to its value proposition is their Bitcoin production and BTC accumulation strategy of CLSK. During the month of October CLSK was able to mine 655, increasing its total holding 8,701 BTC. Unlike most mining companies that immediately sell mined Bitcoin to cover operational expenses, CLSK's approach signals confidence in Bitcoin's long-term appreciation and presents a strong balance sheet to investors with strong expansion strategies with current BTC new highs. October Mining Update (www.cleanspark.com) As BTC continues to soar higher, CLSK will finally be able to apply the current reserves of almost 9,000 BTC to use for future investments to scale its operations. Operational Resilience & Upside Sentiment: Operational growth for CLSK in 2024 has been particularly marked by very strong hashrate expansion. It's hashrate expanded from 9.6 EH/s at the end of 2023 to as high as 31.3 EH/s by October 2024, up 226.04%. In September alone, CLSK added 5 EH/s, underlining its robust infrastructure development and scaling. Moreover, CLSK showed that it is operationally capable of rebounding very fast from external disturbances, such as hurricanes and other natural disasters. Recent updates, show that the company's hashrate has surged further to 31.3 EH/s, underlining its resilience and growth in operations. This operational recovery, together with strategic infrastructure investments, may provide a good case for long-term growth potential. In addition to expanding capacity, CLSK has pursued energy efficiency-reducing consumption from 22.7 joules per terahash to 20.89 J/TH from August to end of October 2024. Less consumed energy improves profitability and brings the company in line with Environmental, Social, and Governance priorities out in the market, securing its position as a greener mining company. Geographical Expansion: Improvement of Operational Stability One of the most vital strategic steps CLSK made in 2024 dealt with expanding into new geographic territories. The company added Wyoming, Mississippi, and Tennessee as its operational sites. By so doing, it materially expanded its geographic diversification. Geographic diversification is critical for miners like CLSK because dependence on single regions is minimized, hence more stability and flexibility against regional challenges, changes in regulations, and natural disasters.1. Acquisitions in Tennessee The addition of seven sites in Tennessee increased the overall mining capacity for CLLSK, adding up to 5 EH/s to its growing hashrate. Of the seven sites added, five were operational and had added 65 MW; the remaining two sites will be fully functional in the near term and are set to add an additional 20 MW. With power restoration from Hurricane Helene completed in September, CLSK's total hashrate is on pace to increase to 33 EH/s, further cementing the company's position regarding efficiency in the sector.2. Wyoming Expansion WY - at CLSK, the company closed its second facility and prepared to build out the data center, developing its capability for further scale. The regulation in Wyoming is very friendly and the energy cost is cheap, which makes this area a good destination for Bitcoin mining. 3. Clinton Mississippi Operations Thus, it is anticipated that these two turnkey locations in Clinton, Mississippi, would have all infrastructure up and running by December 1, 2024, with S21 Pro miners available to turn on. Together, these two sites will add 1 EH/s of mining capacity to CLSK's total, which will bring the company even closer to its long-term goal of 50 EH/s by 2025. Infrastructure Development and Forward Guidance CLSK's expansion plans are not over with its geographic diversification. The infrastructure development strategy of the company has been pursued in addition to the drive of scaling its operations to new heights. In mid-October 2024, CLSK was able to reach a hash rate of 31.3 EH/s. That is only a milestone on the company's road to reach a target of 50 EH/s by 2025, which CLSK‚Äôs management has hinted may be revised upward in the next few months. Monthly KPI's (www.cleanspark.com) CleanSpark | America's Bitcoin Miner ‚Äì Monthly KPI‚Äôs 31.3 EH/s. Merger with GRIID: Another leg of the forward-looking growth strategy has also been recently extended by CLSK through a merger agreement with GRIID Infrastructure Inc., another bitcoin mining company. This all-stock deal, valued at $155 million, is an acquisition of all assets held by GRIID, inclusive of their debt obligations, by CLSK. Under this agreement, CLSK provided a $5 million working capital loan to GRIID and a $50.9 million bridge loan to cover certain financial commitments. This positions CLSK to potentially amplify bitcoin mining operations, increase over 100 megawatts of power in Tennessee by the end of 2024, and reach up to 400 megawatts by 2026. This is a major growth driver in CLSK's strategy, as the company will utilize GRIID's infrastructure and environmentally responsible power sources. Financial Strategy: Funding Growth and Managing Bitcoin Volatility. The financial strategy of CLSK is as bold as its operational expansion. Recent dilution approval of 600 million shares to fund aggressive growth strategies from the company could raise concerns in the short term, but one needs to recognize that previous rounds the capital raised has been utilized gainfully ‚Äì in the past it has been used efficiently for infrastructure expansion, site acquisition, and mining equipment upgrade initiatives. These will eventually result in higher revenues and profitability over the long term and, therefore, should temper the impact of a temporary short-term dilution. That said, having 8,701 Bitcoin reserves acts as a cushion as BTC appreciates this cycle. As highlighted before, most mining companies need to sell a portion of their mined Bitcoins in order to finance operations, while CLSK's actions are proof that it retains a great portion of its mined BTC, showing great financial discipline and conviction on the price in years to come. This will continue to serve as a strategic reserve for CLSK, affording liquidity to underpin future expansions and growth initiatives with the continued appreciation in BTC‚Äôs price. Institutional Support and Strong Buy Ratings: Recently, BlackRock increased its stake in CleanSpark to 19,473,511 shares, or approximately 7.7% ownership from 6.5% earlier this year. This puts BlackRock's aggregate investment in CLSK at approximately $230 million. Other institutional investors such as Vanguard and State Street have also demonstrated confidence in the company, with Vanguard owning approximately 7% of the company. These institutions believe that the high growth in hashrate at CLSK and operational efficiency will continue to drive profit in the future. This optimism also reverberates on Wall Street, where the majority of analysts rank the stock as a Strong Buy. The growth in CLSK's hashrate, along with further expansion, has seen analyst price targets range from $20 to $33, representing potential two or three-digit-percentage gains above its recent trading price today. This institutional support brings more than just much-needed capital to CLSK for further growth; it reinforces confidence in the company's long game. Target Price Variations Chart: www.marketscreener.com This graph illustrates the evolution of CLSK‚Äôs ( CLSK ) target price over time, as estimated by various analysts. Key elements include: Average Target Price: The consensus target price for CLSK has, in fact, been in line with fluctuations, moving its peak to as high as around $40 in January 2021 all the way down in 2022. It has since stabilized and is gradually on the rise. Estimates Activity: Analysts' estimates have remained stable, although there have been some prominent downgrades, especially in early 2022. Green bars represent upgrades, and red bars represent downgrades, while grey bars indicate unchanged estimates. Target Price Range: Analyst target price settings have varied, and the dispersion in the set of high and low estimates creates a wide spread around the average, shown by the blue-shaded area behind the price line. Correlation with Bitcoin Price: Significant Upside Potential Current Situation: - Bitcoin's high in March 2024: $73,794, with CLSK at $15.80. - Current Bitcoin price: $89,400, representing an increase of approximately 21.14% from its March high. - Current CLSK price: $15, showing a slight decrease of about 5.06% from its March level of $15.80. Interpretation Using a 3x Volatility Multiple: Given CLSK's historical 3x volatility multiple in relation to Bitcoin, this relationship can be used to project future performance. Future Scenario Using a 3x Volatility Multiple. - Scenario ‚Äì Long-Term Potential: If Bitcoin reaches $120,000 by late 2024 or early 2025: - This would represent a 34.26% increase from $89,400. - With a 3x volatility multiplier, CLSK‚Äôs stock price could increase by approximately 102.78% (34.26% * 3). - Projected CLSK share price: $30.41 from the current $15. These projections, based on CLSK's high volatility relative to Bitcoin, indicate significant upside potential aligned with Bitcoin‚Äôs anticipated gains. This level of correlation could mean substantial returns for investors, particularly given CLSK's current undervaluation compared to its 2024 highs. www.tradingview.com BTC turns resistance into support and breaks out. Technical Indicators Favoring Upside: www.tradingview.com Recent price action indicates that CLSK has established solid support following earlier sell-offs, with the gap at $13.28 now filled and surpassed, signaling a breakout beyond short-term resistance. Price Target: $20 and Beyond. At the current trading price, CLSK is undervalued with respect to its mining capacity, Bitcoin reserves, and institutional backing. Analysts and market sentiment would suggest that a price target of above $20 is very realistic, driven by several catalysts: ‚Ä¢ Increasing Price of Bitcoin: As Bitcoin continues to enjoy broader acceptance and increases in demand, the price of BTC is set to rise, and miners such as CLSK will obviously benefit as a result. As analyzed above, if the price of the underlier increases, the direct influence would be seen on profitability and the strength of balance sheets for CLSK. ‚Ä¢ Operational Efficiency: CLSK has been focusing on continually optimizing mining infrastructure and has maintained some of the highest hashrates in the industry, thus giving it a competitive advantage. ‚Ä¢ Institutional Momentum: Major financial institutions are significant shareholders in CLSK, and one can expect heavy institutional buying with this stock rebounding off current oversold levels. Such inflows could quickly drive the stock to its $20+ target. Conclusion: Summary of CLSK‚Äôs Growth and Investment Potential CleanSpark remains one of the ambitious miners, targeting a hashrate of 50 EH/s. This is further reinforced by the recent shareholder approval to increase share issuance from 300 million to 600 million, thus providing extra capital that may accelerate the growth trajectory of CLSK. In recent price action, CLSK successfully filled the $13.27 gap and is now trading above it, indicating strong upward momentum that surpasses previous resistance levels. This breakout suggests that short-term barriers are unlikely to limit CLSK‚Äôs long-term growth, given the continued strength in both the stock and the Bitcoin sector. Despite CLSK‚Äôs recent rally, its share price remains undervalued compared to levels seen during Bitcoin‚Äôs prior all-time high, especially now as Bitcoin approaches new potential highs and CLSK‚Äôs mining capacity has expanded substantially. Given CleanSpark's historic trading range of $15 to $21 during Bitcoin's last peak, the stock's current valuation does appear low due to the current operational level CLSK has achieved in BTC mining. Now, with an expanded operational capacity and a robust hashrate compared to previous highs, CleanSpark is better positioned to capture gains as Bitcoin advances. While recent share dilution has raised the total shares, this additional capital strengthens CLSK‚Äôs resources to fund its 50 EH/s target. This combination of increased capitalization and operational growth potential reinforces CleanSpark‚Äôs ability to outperform, presenting a strong case for undervaluation and long-term growth.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4737338-cleanspark-a-deep-dive-into-strategic-growth-geographic-expansion-and-how-to-capitalize-on-a-btc-mining-opportunity?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/36296655.jpeg

36299704,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=101551,1731596546,"Market Expert Suggests Bitcoin Typically Has 385 Days of Uptrend, But Currently in Week 2","According to a market analyst, the recent Bitcoin rally on the back of favorable political outcomes in the U.S. shows potential to reach even greater heights. Following Donald Trump‚Äôs victory and the election of a largely pro-crypto Congress earlier in the month, Bitcoin saw an immediate price surge, reaching a new all-time high of $76,481 following the vote counting exercise.¬†Since then, the price has continued to climb, breaking above $80,000 on Nov. 10 and then surpassing the $90,000 mark on Nov. 12. Its latest peak of $93,483 occurred yesterday. Following a pullback from the $93K top, Bitcoin currently trades around $90,836, marking a 32% increase since the election.Despite this impressive growth, prominent market analyst Rekt Capital suggests that the current rally is just beginning. According to Rekt Capital, Bitcoin could be entering a ‚Äúparabolic upside‚Äù phase, which historically lasts up to 385 days.¬†He points out that Bitcoin is only in the second week of this phase, suggesting there may still be significant room for further gains.Historical Uptrend CyclesAn accompanying chart confirms that Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term cycles display recurring uptrend phases following market downturns. The chart highlights specific points from previous bullish cycles in 2016 and 2020, along with the current one in 2024, to support his analysis. Bitcoin 1M Chart | Rekt Capital In 2016, Bitcoin entered a phase that lasted 518 days from July, with a volume of 5.4 million BTC. Within this phase, it began its parabolic bull uptrend in April 2017 until March of that year, reaching a peak of $19,666 after 244 days of an upward rally.A similar pattern occurred in 2020. Bitcoin entered its next phase from May 2020, lasting 517 days with a volume of 4.889 million BTC tokens.

42435332,xYK0rIu5vMPYEKIa4kozEA,1731596407,Polymarket's Probe Highlights Challenges of Blocking U.S. Users (and Their VPNs),"Polymarket is reportedly under investigation by the Department of Justice for allowing U.S. residents to trade on its platform, despite a regulatory settlement prohibiting such activity.  Even though the prediction market blocks U.S. IP addresses, legal experts said that this alone may not be sufficient to comply with U.S. regulations, especially for companies with a history of regulatory issues like Polymarket.  Aside from geofencing, the only real way to prevent people in restricted countries from accessing a site is by requiring identification, but this means law-abiding users must trust a platform with sensitive personal data, cybersecurity experts said.  Polymarket's current predicament highlights long-simmering compliance questions facing the crypto industry. You might call them Very Persistent, Nagging questions.  At the heart of matter is how blockchain protocols or even centralized crypto firms can address the widespread practice of users turning to virtual private networks, or VPNs, to circumvent geographical restrictions imposed by governments.  On Wednesday, federal law enforcement raided the New York home of Shayne Coplan, Polymarket's 26-year-old founder and CEO. Although it is not yet clear exactly why the raid took place, and neither Coplan nor his company has been charged with wrongdoing, Bloomberg and The New York Times reported the Department of Justice is conducting a criminal investigation of whether Polymarket let U.S. residents trade on its site, in violation of a 2022 regulatory settlement.  Founded in 2020, Polymarket is one of crypto's breakout successes this year, logging billions in trading volume and hundreds of millions in open interest, or contracts outstanding. Bets on the platform are settled in USDC, a stablecoin, which is a cryptocurrency that trades one-for-one with dollars.  Traders use the prediction market to bet on the outcomes of real-world events, everything from whether Jake Paul or Mike Tyson will win their boxing match to which actor will be next to play James Bond.  But the most popular subject by far has been the U.S. presidential election. Polymarket odds ahead of the vote presciently signaled that Donald J. Trump was in the lead while polls showed a tossup. In the weeks leading up to the election, media reports speculated that the market was being manipulated to show Trump ahead, potentially as a way of somehow influencing the outcome, but prediction market experts found the evidence for such claims wanting.  A Polymarket spokesperson called this week's raid political retribution by the outgoing Biden administration for correctly predicting Trump's victory ‚Äì an interpretation widely echoed on social media. If that take is correct, the investigation may be short-lived, with a crypto-friendly president-elect set to take office in January.  Even so, the situation underscores broader questions that may need to be addressed if the new administration and Congress try to foster a more accommodating environment for digital assets.  Polymarket is forbidden to serve U.S. residents under a 2022 settlement with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. It has been blocking users with U.S. IP addresses from trading.  But crafty American traders have been using VPNs to disguise their locations to bet on the platform. (CoinDesk verified at least two such cases).  Unlike regulated financial middlemen, Polymarket does not collect customers' personal information. Aside from an IP address, it has little way of knowing where its generally pseudonymous traders are located.  That's the rub, not just for Polymarket but for a host of crypto entities trying to avoid U.S. jurisdiction, such as projects that ""airdrop"" tokens.  What can companies that geofence the U.S. practically do to prevent Americans from accessing their services through VPNs? And what does the government expect firms to do?  Practical questions  According to privacy and cybersecurity researcher Runa Sandvik, the main thing a company can do to prevent people in restricted jurisdictions from accessing its services is to make them go through a know-your-customer (KYC) process.  ""They'd need KYC,"" she told CoinDesk. ""It's too easy to get around simple IP address blocks.""  Of course, KYC has downsides for users, including law-abiding users, who are asked to share sensitive personal information.  It ""adds more friction to the sign-up process because you need to verify your identity; also need to trust the site is going to keep your data safe,"" Sandvik said.  Aaron Brogan, a crypto industry lawyer, said that hypothetically, a company could strengthen IP address blocks by incorporating GPS data from users' mobile devices, ""but this might be impractical in commercial use."" A customer using a laptop without a GPS, for example, might have a hard time logging on without two-factor authentication.  Other ways to mitigate risk would include ""not advertising into the United States, clearly stating on all relevant products that they are not available to U.S. users, and so forth,"" Brogan added.  Polymarket has a mobile app available to U.S. users, but it only displays the odds generated by its markets and does not enable trading. The company has marketed aggressively on social media, but such platforms are global by definition.  One thing companies can do is to ""monitor for users who change their IP address in a way that suggests the use of a VPN to circumvent a geofence,"" wrote Jake Chervinsky and Daniel Barabander, chief legal officer and deputy general counsel, respectively, for venture capital firm Variant Fund, in a Sept. 30 blog post.  ""For example, if a company observes a user attempting to access a geofenced product using a U.S. IP address and then immediately reconnect the same wallet address or account using a non-U.S. IP address,"" that's a sign of a wily American trying to get around the geoblock. An exchange could then block the rascal's account or wallet address.  Generally, ""it is an open question whether companies need to block all VPN use,"" Chervinsky and Barabander wrote. However, ""regulators have cited screening IP addresses against known VPNs as a positive factor for effective geofencing.""  Last year, in settling sanctions violation charges against CoinList Markets, the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control approvingly noted that among other remedial measures, the San Francisco-based crypto exchange had invested in ""tools to detect the use of VPNs that can obscure users‚Äô location.""  Legal obligations  Part of Polymarket's challenge is that, having previously settled with CFTC, it may be held to a higher standard than a company with no history of running afoul of the U.S., said David Ackerman, a seasoned compliance executive and lawyer.  ""A company that did not have a track record of violations, practically speaking, is held to a different standard,"" Ackerman told CoinDesk. ""Now, obviously [Polymarket] had a track record of violations, and they had a settlement. So the standard of care for somebody like that is going to be different.""  In Ackerman's view, simply blocking IP addresses from the U.S. would not be sufficient to comply with such an order.  ""Geo-fencing is one thing, but it isn't very easy. Everyone has to KYC,"" he said. ""So if there is a discrepancy between the information provided in the KYC and the IP address that is being used, that is a very easy monitor.""  Brogan said geofencing should be viewed as ""more of a risk mitigation strategy than a legal strategy."" The Commodity Exchange Act, which appears to be the law Polymarket is being investigated under, ""likely applies whenever an entity is, in fact, serving U.S. Persons.""  In a 2018 speech, Brian Quintenz, then a CFTC commissioner, articulated a forgiving standard for determining whether blockchain projects are liable for user behavior.  The ""appropriate question is whether these code developers could reasonably foresee, at the time they created the code, that it would likely be used by U.S. persons in a manner violative of CFTC regulations,"" Quintenz said.  Since that speech, Brogan said, ""there has been a sense among some practitioners that taking steps to block U.S. persons might forestall enforcement, but that is not necessarily what the law says.""  The CFTC's 2022 order against Polymarket ""required them to wind down non-compliant markets but did not specify what that compliance would require,"" he said. ""I don‚Äôt know if the CFTC told them privately that geofencing was sufficient, or if they‚Äôve just been in d√©tente for two years.""

36296192,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=653084,1731596400,Dogecoin Price Could See Swift 175% Surge As DOGE/BTC Pair Records Major Breakout,"The Dogecoin price recently surged 20% after President-elect Donald Trump announced the formation of a new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to be led by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy. Interestingly, Dogecoin is up by about 250% in the past 30 days, far outpacing that of Bitcoin‚Äôs 40% increase in the same timeframe. This Dogecoin price overperformance against the Bitcoin price has seen the DOGE/BTC pair breaking above a descending trendline. Notably, crypto analyst KALEO forecasts substantial gains for Dogecoin against Bitcoin, noting a significant breakout in the DOGE/BTC pair. Analyst Says A 175% Dogecoin Price Surge May Be On The Horizon Crypto analyst KALEO highlighted a promising outlook for the Dogecoin price with his recent analysis of the DOGE/BTC trading pair. According to the price chart shared by the analyst, the Dogecoin/Bitcoin pair has been trending downwards since the first half of 2021. This downward path has been full of lower highs and lower lows, leading to the creation of a channel downtrend on a higher timeframe (HTF). However, the recent performance saw the pair break out of the upper trendline. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Burn Rate Crashes 82% Despite Recovery, Can SHIB Price Still Make It To $0.00008 ATH? Interestingly, the last time this happened was in early 2021, just before the crazy 175% rally that sent the Dogecoin price surging to the current all-time high of $0.7316. He pointed out that the current Dogecoin price movement reflects similar momentum, suggesting another rapid 175% rise could be imminent. KALEO emphasized that recent market conditions, Dogecoin‚Äôs resilience, and growing interest stemming from Donald Trump and Elon Musk‚Äôs DOGE‚Äôs department have contributed to a favorable setup for a potential rally. ‚ÄúWith the way the market has moved recently, and how much strength Dogecoin has shown after Trump was elected and Elon starting to push again, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see something similar here,‚Äù he commented. Dogecoin Accumulation Points To A Continued Price Surge Aside from the technical analysis of the Dogecoin price breakout above Bitcoin, KALEO also points out an interesting accumulation trend in the last 48 hours after the breakout. As it stands, the DOGE/BTC pair seems to be taking a breather and is now consolidating within a range. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Prediction: Analyst Sets $320,000 Target As Wave 5 Begins He noted that the current accumulation phase is taking place just above the higher timeframe resistance level, setting a strong foundation for Dogecoin‚Äôs next bullish move. This accumulation trend has served as a launchpad in past rallies, and this could also repeat itself soon. The broader crypto market landscape also supports KALEO‚Äôs bullish prediction for Dogecoin against Bitcoin. Not only is Dogecoin set to keep outperforming Dogecoin, the projected Dogecoin rally is going to be more pronounced considering the Bitcoin price is also projected to keep climbing. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.401, while Bitcoin is trading at $90,800.

36296259,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4737285-bito-etf-the-election-has-improved-bitcoin-miners-fundamentals?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,1731596400,BITO: The Election Has Improved Bitcoin Miners' Fundamentals,"Summary ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) has gained 36% since early October, driven mostly by the election, while lower interest rates have also benefited miners and stabilized Bitcoin prices. Post-April halving, miners face profitability challenges, leading to hardware upgrades and strategic Bitcoin sales to maintain operations and cover costs. These costs and digital asset prices trading lower than break-even costs has prompted miners to sell more of their holdings to ensure liquidity. U.S. election dynamics, particularly around Trump, are favorably impacting Bitcoin prices due to potential policies favoring deregulation and decentralized finance. As a result Bitcoin's price now exceeds break-even, potentially reducing supply and sustaining the upside. Since my last coverage of the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BITO ) on October 3, it has gained nearly 36%, or 18% higher than what I had forecasted in my bullish call which was mainly based on the beneficial effect of lower interest rates on miners' finances together with the fund's high-income rationale. I had not anticipated the momentum induced by the re-election of former President Donald Trump on Bitcoin's ( BTC-USD ) performance which had surged beyond the $88.6K level at the time of writing as shown below. Data by YCharts This thesis aims to show that the upside can continue based on how the election-led demand for crypto has improved miners' fundamentals, namely by propelling Bitcoin's value to exceed the break-even price. Now, since miners are key stakeholders in the crypto ecosystem, this should, in turn, pivot demand-supply dynamics in favor of better asset prices. I also exercise some moderation because of the risks and start by providing an update on the effects of the April halving event. Challenges Faced By Miners Have Determined Asset Prices Since the halving, miners have faced profitability challenges due to reduced block rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC for each block added to the blockchain. In response, some have upgraded to more energy-efficient hardware while others have relocated operations to lower-cost energy destinations. This has led to the total computational power dedicated to Bitcoin mining, or the hash rate evolving rapidly. For this purpose, the chart below shows how things have evolved one month before and after the halving, and the abrupt fluctuations hint that some miners reduced output as others exited the market completely due to lower rewards while costs remained about the same. Data by YCharts Thus, major players have sold many of their coins to finance fleet upgrades , maintain their liquidity positions, and stay competitive in the face of the reduction in block rewards. Now, with miners having to sell more of their holdings, this has resulted in higher supplies reaching the market, in turn, putting pressure on digital asset prices after the halving. Thus, according to a Bloomberg report in August, Bitcoin miners' reserves dropped to a three-year low following the halving due to increased pressure to sell crypto reserves. This explains why despite continued demand from spot ETFs, prices came down to $58K in July as per the chart below. This is in contrast to the 2020 halving when miners mostly avoided selling and instead accumulated crypto assets, thereby reducing supply. This helped to keep up prices, enabling them to record profits. Data by YCharts However, this time around, things are different, and a metric that helps to assess how lower prices impact miner profitability, is the post-halving BTC break-even price, or the minimum selling price needed to generate profits. BTC Price Now Exceeds Break-Even, Meaning Less Supply Now, estimates vary widely with Marathon Digital Holdings ( MARA ), which by the way is the top public miner seeing its break-even increase by 87%, from $23K to $43K . However, looking across the industry there are many smaller private miners, who do not necessarily have the scale of larger peers implying even higher break-even costs. To this end, CryptoQuant mentions a break-even of above $80K to maintain profitability. Tellingly, Bitcoin has now exceeded the $80K level thanks to the election mostly due to President-elect Trump's crypto-friendly stance and the upside looks likely to continue. The reason is the crypto industry invested heavily in the 2024 U.S. elections, achieving significant victories. Not only did Donald Trump, win the presidency, but pro-crypto candidates secured key positions in both the Congress and Senate. As such, industry leaders anticipate reduced regulation and favorable legislation under the new administration, which explains the sudden surge in demand. Thus, as of Nov. 11, U.S.-traded spot ETFs held a combined $84 billion , an amount accumulated over ten months. Now, let‚Äôs assume further inflows of $31.2 billion during the next 6 months as shown in the table below, which is feasible given the total inflows for spot Bitcoin ETFs were about $1.3 billion in the first week of November alone. Table prepared using data from (seekingalpha.com) Now, $31.2 billion is equivalent to around 1.84% of liquidity added to the Bitcoin market cap which is currently around $1.7 trillion. Pursuing further, a study entitled The Crypto Multiplier found that prices can fluctuate significantly with the 90-day rolling standard deviation of daily returns varying from 2.5 to 7.5 from 2017-2023. Considering the average of 5 means that BTC's price can surge by five times for each percentage of additional liquidity added to the crypto market cap. Thus, as a result of more liquidity flowing into crypto and BTC's price elasticity of 5, the value of Bitcoin could increase by 9.18% (1.84% x 5) to $95.4K as shown below. Bullish on BITO but there are also Risks To further support my point about BTC elasticity, I look at liquidity, or the ease with which Bitcoin can be traded (bought or sold) without affecting its price. In this connection, Bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21 million coins, with around 20 million already in circulation, meaning only around 1 million can be created. Also, as seen during the demand for new ETFs, investor enthusiasm can significantly accentuate the price increase (making it highly elastic) given that it is relatively less liquid with $32.1 billion traded daily between January and August 2024 compared to about $7.5 trillion for the forex market. Table prepared using data from (www.seekingalpha.com) Pursuing further, since BITO is linked to the cryptocurrency as shown below, it could also appreciate by approximately the same amount. Thus, I have a target of $26.4 based on the current share price of $24.2 as shown above. www.proshares.com This represents only a slight upside but is justified because of the risks. First, there are high expectations. In this case, the problem is that Bitcoin is known for its extreme price fluctuations, which can occur rapidly and unpredictably, leading to significant losses for investors who are not used to such volatility. Second, in addition to an improvement in fundamentals, the recent surge is also due to some speculation on crypto's potential with some market participants forecasting a price of $150 K by August 2025, making it likely to suffer sudden downturns when investor sentiment shifts. In this connection, in case the successor of Mr. Gensler, the current Chairman of the SEC does not deliver results rapidly, market impatience can have negative consequences for asset prices. Third, some investors with shorter-term investment profiles may be tempted by profit-taking, which could lead to price corrections. Fourth, this remains a volatile asset that is also used for illicit activity including ransomware. In this connection, any major issues like crypto-financed terrorist activity may force the Trump administration to review its relatively lenient approach to crypto regulations probably causing the market to react negatively. Thus, one should not exclude a high degree of volatility, especially if BTC falls below the $80K level, thereby demotivating miners from HODLing. Again due to BTC's price elasticity, such a downside can accentuate the crypto's fall. BITO Remains a Buy to take advantage of Favorable Demand Versus Supply Dynamics Still, I maintain my bullish stance. The reason is another factor that has contributed to the upside is the Federal Reserve reduced interest rates by 25 basis points last week after a 0.5% cut in September. For this purpose, by reducing the cost of capital necessary to fund the purchase of new mining gear, lower borrowing costs can reduce the break-even price, thereby easing miners' transition into the 2024 halving. Additionally, now that Trump is in power, potential policies such as tax cuts can positively influence the price of risk assets in general without forgetting crypto-friendly Elon Musk (as a backer of Doge Coins) now being called upon to form part of the Department of Government Efficiency. Therefore, the ingredients are present for Bitcoin to rise further, and futures-holding BITO is just one of the ways of getting exposure to this asset class. Alternatively, there are spot ETFs like the highly popular iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) which directly tracks the price movements of BTC and already boasts an asset under management of $41 billion after being incepted in January this year. By comparison, BITO which was incepted three years back only holds $2.7 billion in assets. Furthermore, passively managed IBIT charges fees of only 0.12% compared to 0.95% for BITO which makes it a good choice for holding BTC without going through the hassle of owning a crypto wallet. On the other hand, BITO makes sense for those prioritizing income generated by trading futures contracts as it pays monthly dividends at a forward yield of 50% . Now, one of the problems of this income-prioritizing approach is that it is at the expense of capital appreciation but things have been evolving positively for the futures ETF recently, as shown by the difference between the one-month and year-to-date price returns between BITO and IBIT. Hence from $81.30 (91.91-10.61) on a YTD basis, the difference has now shrunk to $7.96 (49.09-41.13) during the last month as per the charts below. Data by YCharts Data by YCharts Now, this could be a temporary price movement occurring in a highly volatile period caused by both ETFs reacting quickly to BTC price changes, but it has still been achieved while BITO has paid a distribution of nearly $1 per share in early November. Also, as I had emphasized in my previous thesis , unlike some options trading strategies, BITO has not suffered from a high degree of decay since its current share price of $24.2 is more than twice its end-of-December level of about $10.43, and this, despite distributing three times more income this year than in 2023. Finally, if the performance gap between BITO and IBIT continues to shrink it may indicate more demand for the futures-based ETF or a reduction over time of the price decay associated with rolling future contracts. Thus, depending on the longer-term performance, the futures-based ETF remains a valid choice to take advantage of improving fundamentals for miners in the post-halving landscape while benefiting from regular income.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4737285-bito-etf-the-election-has-improved-bitcoin-miners-fundamentals?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/36296259.jpeg

The crypto bull market is intensifying as the new week begins, with top altcoins like XRP and Cardano (ADA) showing impressive price gains. Remarkably, both assets have successfully recaptured the long-lost $0.60 level.XRP and Cardano Price MovementXRP hit an intraday peak of $0.6160 on Sunday, which is approximately 25% up from the $0.50 level it traded last week. Notably, XRP was last seen around the $0.61 mark six weeks ago.Meanwhile, Cardano has rallied even stronger than XRP. Today, ADA touched $0.6523 for the first time in seven months. Notably, ADA‚Äôs comeback saw it surge by 51% from a low of $0.4327 to $0.6523 in one day. Meanwhile, XRP's intraday gain was 12%, rising from $0.5188 to $0.6160.This price surge in both altcoins follows Bitcoin's recent all-time high above $80,000, fueling the market‚Äôs growing intensity.Until now, XRP and ADA had been laggards, showing minimal movement in the bull market, leading some critics to label both assets as ""dead."" However, the tide is now turning as both coins reclaim multi-week highs.Now, market analysts believe there‚Äôs still more upside potential for these assets, despite the recent explosive gains, with some issuing bold price targets.Outlook for Cardano¬†In a recent post on X, a market commentator with the username ‚ÄúCryptohodlpod‚Äù shared his price targets for prominent assets like XRP, ADA, and Bitcoin.For Bitcoin, he proposed a target of $170K, which represents an additional $90K increase from its current price‚Äîa 112.5% gain. Notably, the analyst also suggested ADA could rally to $1.89.He identified $1.89 as the most promising price target for Cardano this cycle. While still far from ADA's previous all-time high, this would represent an 83% gain from its current price of $0.65.XRP Price if ADA Reaches $1.89As for XRP, the analyst suggested that if ADA reaches $1.89, XRP could peak at $3.01 this cycle. From the current price of $0.61, this would represent a massive 393% upside for XRP. However, even with this surge, XRP would still be well below its all-time high of $3.84.While this analyst has proposed a conservative outlook for both Cardano and XRP, other market watchers have issued more optimistic predictions. For instance, analyst Ali Martinez has suggested that ADA could hit $7 to $10 in this cycle .¬†At the same time, several other analysts have suggested similar bullish targets for XRP , which they view as realistic given the current market conditions.",POSITIVE,ADA | XRP,ADA | ALTCOIN | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/14/analyst-predicts-xrp-price-if-cardano-is-able-to-reach-1-89/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=analyst-predicts-xrp-price-if-cardano-is-able-to-reach-1-89,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Sigel made the assertion during an interview on CNBC. Notably, he expressed his view about the future price action of the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency.¬†https://twitter.com/SquawkCNBC/status/1857035336301285412¬†Yesterday, Bitcoin crossed the $90,000 mark to set an all-time high (ATH) of $93,434. Bitcoin plunged below the $90,000 mark shortly after the rally, with many investors speculating that the asset‚Äôs uptrend might end soon.¬†Bitcoin Is Just Getting Started However, Sigel believes that the Bitcoin rally is just getting started, forecasting that the top asset would make repeated all-time highs over the next two quarters. He mentioned that Bitcoin‚Äôs latest price action is similar to what happened in the 2020/2021 market cycle.¬†Sigel noted that the price of Bitcoin doubled in 2020 between the period of the U.S. presidential election and year-end. According to him, Bitcoin only saw 6-10% corrections within that period, which he referred to as an expected move.¬†Similarly, the VanEck executive noted that Bitcoin is replicating its 2020 pattern, which began with a surge after the election. He pointed out that Bitcoin has already surged 30% since the election, reinforcing the idea that BTC is just getting started.¬†Factors Backing Sigel‚Äôs Forecast¬†His confidence stems from the company‚Äôs unique technical indicators, which confirm that Bitcoin is expected to continue its bullish streak.¬†He also mentioned an imminent change in government sentiment toward Bitcoin. According to him, the Trump-led cabinet has several pro-Bitcoin officials, ranging from the Vice president to the National Security Adviser.¬†VanEck Sets New Bitcoin Price TargetFollowing the bullish momentum surrounding Bitcoin, Sigel projected that it would trade at $180,000 by the end of this cycle. He expects this prediction to play out by next year.¬†Hitting the $180,000 target requires Bitcoin‚Äôs price to surge by 97.08% from its current value of $91,331. The $180,000 target marks the latest prediction VanEck has issued for the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency. On behalf of VanEck, Sigel has set various targets for Bitcoin. Last month, he projected that Bitcoin could trade at $3 million per token by 2050, with a 16% annual compounded growth rate.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/14/vaneck-sets-new-bitcoin-target-of-180k-says-btc-rally-just-getting-started/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=vaneck-sets-new-bitcoin-target-of-180k-says-btc-rally-just-getting-started,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Dogecoin‚Äôs bullish upsurge has halted at a major resistance on two occasions. The largest meme coin by market cap was held back at the supply zone around $0.44, facing downward pressure on Tuesday and Wednesday.Before then, the dog-themed meme coin was on a bullish free run, crossing multi-year price levels . DOGE is up 104% and 247% in the past week and month, boosting its market cap to $57 billion.Amidst the correction, which market experts forewarned , analyst Trading Jesus has asserted that Dogecoin is on its path to $1 before the end of 2024. In a Thursday analysis, the commentator highlighted possible levels to watch as the meme coin aims to attain a dollar value.Trading Jesus Provides Levels to WatchTrading Jesus‚Äôs TradingView analysis shows that Dogecoin will attain $1 by year-end. In an accompanying 1H DOGE chart, the analyst highlighted price zones to watch during the highly anticipated upswing. Dogecoin To $1 NEW 1112 Dogecoin To $1, Image Source: Trading View: https://www.tradingview.com/chart/DOGEUSDT/BmGXAz6I-DOGE-COIN-TARGET-2024/ The market commentator noted that Dogecoin has supports at $0.34, $0.25, and $0.18. Notably, the $0.34 local demand zone was DOGE‚Äôs major resistance before it broke through it two days ago.Meanwhile, Dogecoin has flipped the $0.34 zone to support and has sustainably held above the price level despite facing selling pressure from its next resistance. Trading Jesus argues that Dogecoin will break past the $0.44 resistance if it continues to hold the demand zone.Furthermore, the market analyst asserted that a break above the current resistance will push Dogecoin by 27% to $0.56. The meme coin would further appreciate another 31% to $0.7336 before ultimately trading at $1.Dogecoin AnalysisThe 4-hour chart shows the meme coin is gaining bearish momentum. DOGE‚Äôs relative strength index (RSI) trades at 63.14, trending close to the overbought zone.Also, the MACD indicator has flipped bearish after a crossover, with the MACD line at 0.03477 and the signal line at 0.03940. The two lines have begun widening, signaling that the bearish momentum might prevail for some time.

The multichain strategy is set to kick in next year.  SG-FORGE, the digital assets-focused subsidiary of French bank Societe Generale, said it will deploy its euro stablecoin, EUR CoinVertible (EURCV), on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) network as it looks to expand across multiple blockchains.  This ""multi-chain approach"" is planned to kick in next year, pending final technical integrations, the company said.  EURCV started on Ethereum in 2023 as a highly regulated product to compete with top dollar stablecoin issuers Circle and Tether. The token gained limited traction, with 38 million in issuance compared with Circle's 92 million EURC. Both are dwarfed by the dollar-linked coins: market leader Tether's $126 billion USDT and Circle's $37 billion USDC.  The firm announced plans earlier this year to deploy the token on Solana, hoping to get better traction with the network's faster and cheaper transactions.  ""This is just the beginning,"" Guillaume Chatain, chief revenue officer at SG-FORGE, said in a statement. ""We look forward to further innovation and expanding the reach of our portfolio of digital solutions.""  With the deployment on XRPL, SG-FORGE is looking to benefit from the network's cross-border payment and tokenization capabilities, touting its fast settlements and low-cost transactions. EURCV will use Ripple Custody services for issuance.  ""Bringing trusted, banking-grade stablecoins like EURCV onto the XRPL is critical to enabling institutional use cases, like payments, which is a core focus for Ripple,"" said Markus Infanger, SVP at RippleX.  Stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies with their price anchored to government-issued currencies, are increasingly popular for payments across the globe, offering a more efficient and cheaper way to move money. As countries roll out regulations for the asset class, more banks are getting interested in issuing their own stablecoin. Spanish bank BBVA, for example, said it plans to issue a stablecoin on Ethereum next year using payment firm Visa's tokenization platform.  Ripple is also at an advanced stage of issuing its own U.S. dollar stablecoin, RLUSD. The token is ""operationally ready,"" awaiting regulatory approval by the New York Department of Financial Services, Ripple president Monica Long said in an interview with CoinDesk last month.",POSITIVE,USDT | XRP,ETH | FIAT | USDT | WALLET | XRP,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/11/14/socgen-crypto-arm-to-bring-its-euro-stablecoin-to-xrp-ledger-lays-out-plan-for-going-multichain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/995c196d5dbd0904c08865f2917988cb4b4a3f84-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

36295849,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=101494,1731593246,BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Sees Record-breaking $5B Turnover Amid BTC All-Time High Surge,"BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF has seen a record-breaking single-day turnover of $5 billion amid Bitcoin's ongoing spectacular price rallies. Bitcoin reached a new all-time high on November 13, hitting $93,477 during late trading. This milestone was accompanied by unprecedented activity in the Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) market. In a post on X, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas revealed that the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), managed by BlackRock, recorded a $5 billion daily trading volume on Wednesday, surpassing its previous record.¬†Balchunas noted that only three other ETFs and eight individual stocks saw higher volumes on that day. Over a three-day period, IBIT amassed $13 billion in trading activity, signaling a substantial rise in investor interest. BlackRock historical chart showing trading volume since inception Other Bitcoin ETFs, such as Fidelity‚Äôs FBTC, also saw notable increases in trading volumes, though on a smaller scale.Meanwhile, the broader Bitcoin ecosystem has also experienced a surge, with weekly trading volumes hitting $110 billion ‚Äî an all-time record ‚Äî with two days still remaining in the trading week.Spot-Driven Rally and Record Weekly VolumesThe surge in ETF volumes has been attributed to a spot-driven rally, with data showing a muted increase in CME open interest.¬†Santiment also highlighted that Bitcoin‚Äôs seven largest ETFs collectively saw $8.21 billion in trading volume on November 13, the highest since the March 14 peak when Bitcoin reached $73,700.According to Santiment , this heightened activity reflects a strong polarity between buyers and sellers. It noted that the current peak may represent a temporary top if historical patterns hold. BlackRock ETF Leads Inflows¬†In terms of inflows, BlackRock's ETF continued to dominate. On November 12, it attracted $778.3 million, significantly outpacing its peers. The following day, IBIT added another $230.8 million. In comparison, Fidelity‚Äôs FBTC saw $37.2 million in inflows on November 12 and $186.1 million on November 13.¬†Other ETFs, including Bitwise‚Äôs BITB and ARK‚Äôs ARKB, reported smaller inflows over the same period. Year-to-date inflow data shows IBIT leading with $29.15 billion, followed by FBTC at $11.12 billion.¬†Goldman Sachs' Exposure to BlackRock Bitcoin ETFIn related news, Goldman Sachs has emerged as a significant player in the Bitcoin ETF market. According to recent SEC filings, the bank holds approximately $418.65 million in Bitcoin ETFs. Its largest position is in IBIT, where it owns nearly 7 million shares valued at $238.6 million.¬†The bank also reported holdings in several other Bitcoin ETFs, including Fidelity‚Äôs Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund and Invesco‚Äôs Galaxy Bitcoin ETF. Collectively, these investments underscore Goldman Sachs‚Äô broad-based approach to Bitcoin exposure.

36293169,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=653054,1731591053,Buy Dogecoin Now Or Wait? Analyst Points To Key Technical Indicator,"The Dogecoin price has put in a sensational performance since November 4th. In the past 10 days, Dogecoin has risen by an incredible 170%, with no major correction to date. After reaching its highest level since May 2021 at $0.4385 on Tuesday, the DOGE price was trading at just under $0.40 at the time of writing. Buy Dogecoin Now Or Wait? Crypto analyst Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA), who recently gained significant attention on X (formerly Twitter) for his Dogecoin price analysis, has posted a series of updates addressing the question on whether investors should buy Dogecoin now or wait for a potential market correction. Kevin revealed that he has started taking profits from his Dogecoin holdings due to recent price appreciations. ‚ÄúI sold an additional 3% of my Dogecoin bag at $0.39,‚Äù he stated. ‚ÄúThat makes for a total of 8% of my entire DOGE bag sold. I have 92% of my bag remaining.‚Äù He outlined a systematic approach to profit-taking as the price climbs, with specific targets in mind. ‚ÄúMy next planned take profit area will be previous all-time highs, then $1 if we get there. My goal is to have 25% of entire bag sold by the time we get to $1, then we ride from there and play it as it goes.‚Äù Related Reading: Dogecoin Outperforms Bitcoin: Bloomberg Expert Explains Why Despite the bullish momentum, Kevin warns of an impending market correction that could impact Dogecoin significantly. ‚ÄúThe correction that is inevitably coming is going to melt so many weak hands away; it‚Äôs gonna be wild to see,‚Äù he cautioned. He observed that while many altcoins have already undergone corrections‚Äîsome by as much as 20-25%‚ÄîDogecoin has been an exception. ‚ÄúBasically all altcoins are getting the correction I called for besides Dogecoin,‚Äù he noted. Kevin‚Äôs analysis centers on a key technical indicator, the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which measures the speed and change of price movements. A high RSI indicates overbought conditions, suggesting a potential price reversal. ‚ÄúStill keeping a close eye on Dogecoin for a sharper drop,‚Äù he commented. ‚ÄúBased off history and the current technicals, it still heavily supports a correction to cool off indicators before heading higher.‚Äù He pointed out that Dogecoin‚Äôs daily RSI has reached alarming levels. ‚ÄúDaily RSI just tapped 94 again and the 0.786 FIB [Fibonacci retracement level]. I think this is the likely scenario in the short term,‚Äù Kevin explained. ‚ÄúThat RSI needs to cool off badly.‚Äù Related Reading: Dogecoin Price May Explode By 10,200% Based On Classic Chart Pattern: Expert Kevin predicts a short-term price decline for Dogecoin before a resurgence. ‚ÄúI think Dogecoin will go back to $0.26‚Äì$0.28 and then reload to come back up and break ATHs [all-time highs],‚Äù he stated. While acknowledging that a surge in Bitcoin‚Äôs price could temporarily boost Dogecoin, he remains cautious. ‚ÄúIf BTC taps $94K‚Äì$95K in the short term, it will drag DOGE higher, but I still think we get a bigger correction before heading higher,‚Äù Kevin asserted. Despite short-term concerns, Kevin maintains a positive long-term outlook for Dogecoin. ‚ÄúThe Dogecoin monthly RSI is currently at 74, which is full bull market territory,‚Äù he highlighted. ‚ÄúThe Monthly RSI tops out in DOGE bull markets anywhere from 88‚Äì98. We got a long way to go, folks.‚Äù He also cautioned against unrealistic price predictions propagated by some influencers. ‚ÄúIf your Twitter #Crypto Guru is telling you #Dogecoin is going to $28, I urge you to unfollow them. It‚Äôs pure clickbait and is literally close to impossible,‚Äù Kevin warned. ‚ÄúAsk them what the market cap would be at that price level and see how they react. They don‚Äôt care about you; they want you as exit liquidity.‚Äù At press time, DOGE traded at $0.40.

Q3 results showed 8% revenue growth, but increased costs per BTC due to April's halving and higher energy expenses. The company raised $240M YTD through share sales, with liquidity at $145M, but continued share dilution is expected to fund operations. Future plans include upgrading mining equipment and exploring HPC/AI opportunities, but I maintain a Hold rating on BITF stock due to ongoing financial challenges. I've covered Bitfarms ( BITF ) a few time already. As Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) mining company, it's one of the best, enjoying better cash flow history than many other. During my previous coverage, I noted how its operating cash flows were almost growing enough to generate positive free cash flow. I also discussed an ongoing takeover attempt by Riot Platforms ( RIOT ), which had caused the company leadership to shuffle. With their Q3 earnings call out Wednesday morning, valuable updates came in that provide more light on the company. I feel a bit better than I did last quarter, but BITF still has a long way to go before it's buyable, and I maintain my Hold rating. Bitfarms' Settlement With Riot Bitfarms finally reached a settlement with Riot in court. Amid its previous takeover attempts, Riot had acquired almost 20% of the company. In essence, Riot will no longer attempt to take it over, but it will retain its position. This has allowed for a lot more certainty about Bitfarms's status as an independent company and allowed its leadership team to stabilize. Q3 2024 Company Presentation The management team has been filled with new positions, to support the new CEO's (Ben Gagnon) vision for the company. There are also new independent directors on the Board now. With the settlement in place, these should be biggest changes to leadership for a long time. Bitfarms Q3 Financial Results Overall, I wouldn't call Q3's results an improvement or a decline from the previous quarter. Q3 2024 Company Presentation The company managed to grow its revenue by 8%, quarter over quarter, even though all of Q3 is post-halving and therefore would have halved BTC production with the same assets. Unsurprisingly, their gross mining margin contracted between the two quarters. Management expressed this in terms of total cash cost per BTC in their earnings release : Total cash cost of production per BTC* was $52,400 in Q3 2024, up from $47,300 in Q2 2024 due to higher energy cost, increased network difficulty and lower transaction fees. As the halving occurred in April, Q2's BTC production was mixed with some pre-halving benefits. Q1's cash cost per BTC was $27,900, very nearly half that of Q3, showing the impact of the halving event. Thankfully, it will be a few years before another occurs. Cash Flow Statement (Q3 2024 Form 6K) When we look to the cash flows, we can see that YTD operating cash flows not only remained positive but grew 40%, year-over-year. Crucially, however, significantly more has been spent on capex (through PP&E and equipment prepayments). Between Q2 and Q3, this accounted for over $100M in additional capex. In order to fund this, almost $240M has been raised YTD through the sale of common shares. Between Q2 and Q3, common shares outstanding grew from 451.3M to 472.5M. Balance Sheet (Q3 2024 Form 6K) The company currently has about $145M in liquidity, from its cash and BTC holdings. This is about $65M less cash than last quarter (concurrent with the cash burn on capex). The company still has decent liquidity for the near-term, but with this level of outflow, I expect share dilution to continue. Future Outlook With the new leadership in place and plans in motion, the company has two main focuses for the future: its BTC mining and the budding HPC/AI opportunity. Q3 2024 Company Presentation First, the company is looking to upgrade its sites with the Bitmain T21 miner, which they project will allow for a 75% increase in their hash rate and provide a 10% efficiency on electrical costs. This will be very important, after the halving event. Q3 2024 Form 10Q On the HPC/AI front, management has located two prospective sites for a pilot program of this new business. Q3 2024 Company Presentation Initially announced at the last earnings call, the idea here is to use the electrical expertise that they've developed for BTC mining and offer megawatt capacity to data centers as an additional revenue source. While most of this is outside of the U.S., Bitfarms aims to grow its U.S. megawatt capacity to be its largest source. This could very well play an important role in making positive cash flows a reality. During the earnings call, however, management remained positive about its BTC mining business, guiding for higher returns on capital in this business than the HPC/AI segment will. This is predicated on their assumptions that a BTC bull run is around the corner. For my part, I take the HPC/AI business more seriously, as contributing to the electrical infrastructure of data centers strikes me as a much more tangible need, with more certain cost and revenue projections than a cryptocurrency can currently offer. Conclusion Bitfarms navigated the Riot takeover attempt, and it remains independent. With that done, attention can return solely to the business itself. That business is one that makes continued improvements but is challenged by a lack of positive cash flows. As a yet-to-come BTC bull run will be the best near-term boon to this, the company must continue to sell more shares to fund operations until its newer business and launches and earn revenues. BITF's $1.2B market cap likely fairly values the financial potential of the company, but with more dilution likely, I'm hesitant to rate this a Buy just yet, and I maintain my Hold rating.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4737278-bitfarms-takeover-abated-still-a-work-in-progress?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/36293135.jpeg

36289869,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=653024,1731585603,Solana Rising: Key Metrics Hint At Serious Ethereum Competitor,"The Solana blockchain network has been making tremendous strides and is on its way to catching up with Ethereum. Based on hedge fund Syncracy Capital‚Äôs recent findings, the market share and the valuation of Solana have increased in a short period, going as far as an estimate placing the network at 33% of the worth of Ethereum. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Watch: 60% Rally Catches Whale Attention ‚Äì Is More Growth Ahead? This progress highlights how far Solana has come since being considered an undervalued player in 2023, thanks to more coherent architecture, higher transactions per second and simplicity of development. Solana has seen, and continues to see, an increasing volume of activity on-chain and growth in users and builders, after shaking off the difficulties caused by the collapse of FTX. Advancement Of App Earnings And Other Metrics Undoubtedly, the most noteworthy change this month is that Solana set a new record, outperforming Ethereum in terms of monthly application revenue. This is hardly surprising, given the rise in applications that are finance and commerce oriented. Retailers have found Solana very appealing because it is easy to use on mobile devices, and has low transaction costs. Pumpdotfun and other apps like it are also showing off the full potential of Solana‚Äôs network. These apps currently make over $348 million a year. With about 42 million SOL locked as of October 26, Solana‚Äôs TVL has reached a two-year high. By contrast, Ethereum‚Äôs TVL has stayed somewhat unchanged ‚Äì particularly in decentralized finance (DeFi) and decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) ‚Äì which are both seeing a spike in usage on the platform. This rise in TVL reflects the growing confidence in Solana‚Äôs ecosystem. The Future Of Solana And The Expanding Ecosystem The appeal of Solana‚Äôs ecosystem is steadily on the rise, even vying with Ethereum in the few niches that remain uncontested. The network does not only focus on retail merchants, but it is also on the rise with several innovative DePIN protocols that aim to incentivize the users to maintain the real world infrastructure. Solana‚Äôs forthcoming Firedancer upgrade is anticipated to further improve the network‚Äôs scalability. Syncracy Capital said this will maintain Solana‚Äôs valuation disparity with Ethereum at a low level, thereby establishing it as a formidable competitor. Related Reading: XRP Price Patterns And 2024 Election Spark Talk Of A New Rally SOL Price Forecast It is projected that by the 14th of December, 2024, the price of Solana will have appreciated by 12%, hitting $242, data from CoinCodex shows.¬†Considering that the Fear & Greed Index lies within its ‚ÄòExtreme Greed‚Äô limits and consumer behavior is still positive, it would be more logical to purchase Solana at this point in time. More so, there is a likelihood that the price of Solana will also go up bearing in mind the efficiency of the network and the month‚Äôs growth of 30%.

42435339,xYK0rIu5vMPYEKIa4kozIg,1731585421,What Does a 60/40 Portfolio Look Like if We Replace Bonds With Bitcoin? A Lot Better: Van Straten,"The traditional 60/40 portfolio, which ensures growth from equities and bonds that helped manage risk, was the perfect vehicle for the analog economy.  Adding bitcoin to a 60/40 portfolio increases the returns as the allocation increases.  It may be time to reassess the wisdom of the 60/40 portfolio, which was created back in the early 1950's and is often referred to as the ""Modern Portfolio Theory."" The theory was created by Harry Markowitz who tried to optimize a portfolio from a risk reward standpoint .  The traditional 60/40 portfolio is split into equities (60%) and fixed income (40%). It was designed to make the portfolio diversified and balanced, and managing both risk and growth simultaneously.  Equities would give you those much-needed returns in good times, but in bad times, bonds were there to capture the drawdowns and weather the storm. However, we may need to change our thinking as we head into a new era of inflation above 2% and high interest rates.  The U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation year-over-year has not been at the Federal Reserve mandate of 2% since February 2021. In fact, as of Nov. 13, CPI inflation was 2.6%, a 0.2% increase from the month prior.  Interest rates globally have continued to decline in the last four decades, pushing bonds higher, especially during the post-2008 zero-rate policy environment. However, since 2021 interest rates have risen and bonds have suffered, experiencing their largest drawdowns. An example of this is the BlackRock iShares 20-plus Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT), which has witnessed a 54% drawdown from its peak in 2020 to the trough in 2023.  Beating inflation is the name of the game now, as currency debasement becomes a real concern for investors worldwide. This can be seen in the bond market, where the U.S. 10-year yield climbed to its highest level since July after the Fed's first rate cut back in September, now at 4.4% from 3.6%, crushing bonds in the process.  The 60/40 portfolio  Taking a look at data from Curvo, a data and financial provider, we can see what a 60/40 portfolio would look like.  For equities, Curvo chose iShares Core MSCI World UCITS ETF USD in the MSCI World Index and for the bonds, they take Xtrackers Global Sovereign UCITS ETF 1C EUR hedged in the FTSE World Government Bond - Developed Markets index. Since the beginning of 2014, an initial investment of euro 10,000 ($10,500) investment would have returned just above euro 20,000 ($21,000), essentially doubling in 10 years. Which seems like good returns.  However, what would happen if we add bitcoin {{BTC}} to the mix?  For the analysis, we have taken a 1%, 2%, 3%, 5%, and 10% allocation in bitcoin. A 1% allocation would see a 0.5% decrease in both equities and bonds to keep the split equal; this would be the same as the BTC allocation incrementally gets higher. As you can see the higher the bitcoin allocation the greater the return. A 10% bitcoin allocation would yield of over euro 70,000 ($73,000) or over a 3x return compared to the traditional equity allocation.  Just for fun, we adapted the original 60/40 portfolio to include 60% equities and a 40% bitcoin allocation to replace the bonds, the results show a whopping 50x return of nearly euro 500,000 ($526,000).  To include 2024 data, the analysis takes a year-to-date return of 101% for bitcoin. While, taking the average annual performance of the original 60/40 portfolio.  Due to bitcoin's risk-off monetary properties, such as not having a CEO or a central point of failure, bitcoin can act as a diversified entity in a 60/40 portfolio. The analysis didn't include tech stocks such as Tesla (TSLA) or NVIDIA (NVDA) for these reasons.  Also, since its inception bitcoin has provided greater returns than gold annually, hence we opted for bitcoin.

42435333,xYK0rIu5vMPYEKIa4kozBS,1731585386,U.S. ETF Inflows Hit $4.7B Over 6 Days as Bitcoin Becomes 7th-Largest Asset in the World,"Bitcoin has become the seventh largest asset on the planet, recently surpassing Saudi Aramco  Bitcoin dominance continues to make new highs, recently touching 61.38%  U.S. spot-listed ETFs see over $4.7 billion in net inflows in the past six trading days  Bitcoin {{BTC}} is on a roll.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has just become the seventh-largest asset by market cap on the planet, overtaking oil giant Saudi Aramco. Its dominance over the crypto industry set a high of 61.38% and the price hit a record of over $93,000 on Wednesday.  A large part of the recent success is due to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's pro-crypto stance during the election campaign. As of today, the Republicans won the House, completing the trifecta and boding well for cryptocurrency prices due to favorable regulation.  Another part of BTC's success comes from the massive inflows into U.S. spot-listed exchange-traded funds (ETF). In the past six trading days, bitcoin ETFs have seen a whopping $4.7 billion of net inflows, including more than $510.1 million on Wednesday alone. This brings the total since their introduction in January to $28.2 billion, according to Farside data.  Since the launch, there have been questions raised about whether they were part of the basis trade or net long positions. But as the year has progressed, it seems investors are moving away from the basis trade, which is a net neutral strategy that is becoming a smaller trade over time.  Analyst Checkmate supports the argument that the majority of the demand is coming from the ETFs.  ""The Bitcoin ETFs are by far the majority driving force of bitcoin demand right now, soaking up almost all of the selling by Long-Term Holders. CME open interest is not growing meaningfully, reinforcing that this is a spot-driven rally,"" they said in a post on X.  BlackRock's iShare Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) continues to hit record after record in trading volume, touching $5 billion for the first time, according to Eric Balchunas, a senior analyst at Bloomberg.  ""I thought things were cooling off, but no, IBIT just saw $5b in volume today for first time ever. Only 3 ETFs and 8 stocks saw more action today. Up to $13b in 3 days this week. Its peers seeing heightened volume too but smaller scale. FBTC did $1b, biggest day since March"", Balchunas said.  The Ethereum blockchain's ether {{ETH}} is also seeing renewed interest in U.S. spot-listed products, with a further $146.9 million inflow on Nov. 14, taking the total net inflow to $241.7 million, according to Farside data.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,James Van Straten,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/11/14/us-etf-inflows-hit-47b-over-6-days-as-bitcoin-becomes-7th-largest-asset-in-the-world,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e9dcf20160071d4dbba863134d9a3873c3a740a4-4104x2308.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

With a market cap of $919 million, the MOG coin has increased by 37% in the last 24 hours. It is currently trading at $0.000002341 and is at a crucial crossroads. With a massive bullish engulfing candle, the MOG coin prepares for a breakout rally above $0.000002355.¬†With an intraday pullback of 3.33% from the opening price of $0.000002409, the massive overhead supply delays the breakout rally. Will the broader market push help the MOG coin to create a new all-time high?¬†MOG Coin Price AnalysisOn the daily chart, MOG Coin is exhibiting a cup-and-handle pattern. It is attempting a breakout but struggling to gain momentum due to the strong supply zone around $0.000002355. The coin has had difficulty sustaining an uptrend above this level. Mog Coin Price Chart Furthermore, the massive profit booking above this level has led to higher price rejections in late July, early November, and today. Due to this, a pin bar shooting star candle is under formation. This increases the chances of an evening star reversal in the MOG coin.¬†However, the massive bullish engulfing candle formed with a 32% jump yesterday has increased the breakout chances significantly. The candle extends from the opening price of $0.000001822 to the closing of $0.000002409.¬†Furthermore, the massive surge has led to a positive crossover in the MACD and Signal lines.¬†Additionally, the price action has found support at the 78.60% Fibonacci retracement level, as well as the 50-day SMA, indicating strong underlying demand.Furthermore, the 100-day and 200-day SMA lines are nearing a positive crossover, suggesting that with broader market support, a breakout rally in MOG Coin is highly probable.Volatility Spike Signals Potential for Extended Bull RunThe key resistance level at $0.000002355 has led to previous bearish reversals. The first failure occurred in late July when volatility peaked at 239%, while the second failure took place in late October with volatility peaking at 157%. Mog Coin Volatility In both July and October, volatility formed lower highs, but the recent bullish challenge has seen volatility spike above 170%, signaling a potential shift in trend. This new volatility surge suggests a change in market behavior, which could drive the coin into a new phase of upward movement.With the broader market maintaining a positive outlook, the increased volatility and heightened speculation surrounding MOG Coin could propel a bull run.MOG Coin Price TargetsBased on the Fibonacci levels, the breakout rally in the MOG coin above $0.00002355 could challenge the 1.272 or 1.618 Fibonacci levels. These Fibonacci levels coincide with the price target at $0.0000032108 and $0.0000047622.¬†Conversely, a bullish failure could result in a pullback to the $0.000001845 or the 78.60% Fibonacci level.",POSITIVE,MOG,BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | MOG,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/14/mog-coin-at-crossroads-will-high-volatility-lead-to-new-all-time-highs/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=mog-coin-at-crossroads-will-high-volatility-lead-to-new-all-time-highs,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Currently, XRP is trading 81% below its all-time high, while Bitcoin is in a price discovery phase , regularly claiming new peaks.Notably, Bitcoin has gained 112% year-to-date (YTD), while XRP‚Äôs growth over the same period is significantly slower, with just an 11% gain. Meanwhile, prominent altcoins like Solana and BNB have closely mirrored Bitcoin‚Äôs performance this year, each registering over 100% YTD gains.Data shows that among the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap, 71 of them are outperforming XRP in terms of yearly price performance.With such disappointing results , many have written XRP off, arguing it has no bull market potential. However, core XRP proponents continue to assert that the asset still holds significant promise.XRP Could Rally to ATH ‚ÄúWithin Weeks‚ÄùIn a post on X, macro investor ""Pharaoh"" pointed out that it‚Äôs in XRP‚Äôs nature to frustrate holders with its stagnant, suppressed price action. However, he reassured them that this pattern may persist until someday, the price suddenly surges past its all-time high within a matter of weeks.This perspective draws parallels to XRP‚Äôs price action in 2017/2018 when the asset traded with two leading zeros but dramatically changed course towards the end of the bull cycle. For instance, as of December 11, 2017, XRP traded at $0.2365, but over the subsequent three weeks, it surged by 1,523%, reaching $3.84.XRP enthusiasts are hoping for a similar repeat of history in the current bull run. XRP chart XRP Bull Run Already in MotionMeanwhile, it‚Äôs important to note that XRP has already started to break free from its previous sluggish price action. This week, XRP is up over 25%, trading above the $0.70 mark for the first time in eight months.This encouraging comeback has given market watchers and XRP enthusiasts renewed confidence that the asset‚Äôs bull market potential remains intact. According to analyst Javon Marks, XRP‚Äôs recent bullish signals are showing early-stage results. However, he believes this could be just the beginning of a massive rally, potentially leading to new all-time highs and beyond.On a more conservative outlook, Marks has set a target of $15 for XRP. However, in the event of a full-blown rally, where XRP repeats its historical performance, he sees the potential for the price to soar as high as $200.

36293498,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=101473,1731579061,Shiba Inu Team Predicts SHIb is Going To $0.00006861,"Shiba Inu marketing lead, Lucie, expresses confidence in SHIB‚Äôs current position and predicts a potential surge to the $0.00006 price mark. The ecosystem marketer made this known in a recent tweet, suggesting that SHIB is ‚Äòdoing just fine.‚Äô She attached a chart to confirm this assertion, showing a substantial price increase in SHIB‚Äôs performance against the dollar and Bitcoin since its inception.¬†According to the chart, Shiba Inu was priced at $0.00002619 as of November 11, with a lifetime gain of 1,958,563% for the USDT pair and 370,817% in the BTC pair.¬†SHIB Next Target The marketing lead predicted Shiba Inu‚Äôs potential surge to $0.00006861. However, she did not set a timeline for when this prediction would materialize.¬†A few hours after the forecast, Shiba Inu registered an impressive rally, rising to a seven-month high of $0.00003031. Projections of a possible rally to the $0.00006861 target emerged, but the token eventually plunged below the $0.00003 mark.¬†SHIB is changing hands at $0.00002594 in the hours leading to press time. This suggests that the token must surge by 165% to hit the projected target of $0.00006861.¬†Even if Shiba Inu clinches this target, it will still be down 20.36% from its all-time high (ATH) record of $0.00008616, registered in October 2021.https://twitter.com/LucieSHIB/status/1855943806455091239SHIB Isn‚Äôt in Alt Season Despite Recent Gains¬†In the meantime, SHIB is up 37.13% over the past seven days and 41% month-to-date (MTD). This surge comes amid a broader market rally led by Bitcoin.¬†According to Lucie, Shiba Inu‚Äôs recent performance does not imply that the market is in the Alt (Altcoin) Season. For context, altcoin prices usually skyrocket, outperforming Bitcoin‚Äôs during this phase. Currently, Bitcoin is leading the rally across the market, influencing the prices of other assets like SHIB along the line.Investors Remain Bullish in SHIB Amid Growing Interest¬†Meanwhile, Shiba Inu‚Äôs proponents are bullish about SHIB‚Äôs prospects in the upcoming Alt Season, with many expecting the token to set a new all-time high of $0.0001 and above.¬†While it remains unclear whether SHIB will achieve this feat, the token has gained interest from investors. Earlier today, Lucie revealed that SHIB was trending on X under the Business & Finance niche. Specifically, at least 41,300 X posts mentioned SHIB, indicating a growing interest in the token.https://twitter.com/LucieSHIB/status/1856836017161945479?t=TQ_N0OwpE0fvAKm8i660NQ&s=19",POSITIVE,BTC | SHIB,ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/14/shiba-inu-team-predicts-0-00006861-as-next-target-says-shib-is-doing-fine/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=shiba-inu-team-predicts-0-00006861-as-next-target-says-shib-is-doing-fine,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Bitcoin's price surged to a new all-time high on Wednesday, climbing past $90,000 amid renewed optimism in the market.¬†This jump followed a week-long bullish run following the outcome of the U.S. presidential election. Specifically, Bitcoin set a fresh record of $93,480 before easing slightly to $89,413¬†as of press time. Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin‚Äôs price saw a 2.77% gain, while the past seven days marked a substantial 20.03% increase.In the wake of Bitcoin‚Äôs recent breakout, analyst Ali Martinez identified a technical pattern suggesting further upward momentum.Cup-and-Handle Pattern Taking Bitcoin to $255KMartinez highlighted a ""Cup and Handle"" formation in Bitcoin‚Äôs price action, which often indicates a bullish continuation. The rounded base, marking the ‚ÄúCup‚Äù phase, began mid-2022 and extended to early 2023. Notably, Bitcoin had bottomed near $15,000 during this period.¬†This phase concluded as Bitcoin recovered to a key resistance level of $73,750 in early 2024, initiating a consolidation period that formed the ‚ÄúHandle‚Äù of the pattern. Martinez‚Äôs analysis projects a bullish target of $255,450 for Bitcoin, which aligns with a measured Fibonacci projection near the 2.272 level. If achieved, this would represent a 185.7% increase from current levels.https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1856710863023190231Following the recent climb to $90,000 , a potential pullback could offer an entry point near $80,000, according to analyst Micha√´l van de Poppe. Meanwhile, the $100,000 mark remains a psychological target for many traders, especially if the bullish sentiment continues.Dangers of Heightened Optimism Around Bitcoin $100K TargetAs Bitcoin touched record highs, data from market intelligence platform Santiment revealed heightened social media speculation around potential price targets above $100,000.

Bitcoin Has Just Set A New All-Time High Above $93,000 Bitcoin had seen a bit of a pause in its bull run yesterday, but the uptrend has already returned for its price in spectacular fashion today as the coin has now achieved a new all-time high (ATH) beyond the $93,000 mark. Related Reading: XRP NVT Ratio Has Been High Recently: What It Means The chart below shows how the coin‚Äôs recent trajectory has looked. Following this rally, Bitcoin is sitting in weekly gains of over 24%. As is generally the case, the other assets in the sector have also followed BTC in this run, with Ethereum (ETH), the largest of the lot, garnering similar profits. However, many altcoins have outperformed these two giants, with Dogecoin (DOGE) particularly standing out with its impressive 120% positive returns. Whenever the market goes through such a bullish phase, investor sentiment shifts towards the better. The same has also happened this time, as the Fear & Greed Index shows. Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Is Now At A Value Of 84 The ‚ÄúFear & Greed Index‚Äù refers to an indicator created by Alternative that tells us about the average sentiment among the investors in Bitcoin and the wider cryptocurrency markets. This metric uses a numeric scale from zero to a hundred to represent the trader mentality. Values above the 53 mark imply the average investor is showing greed, while those under 47 suggest the presence of fear in the market. The region between these two cutoffs corresponds to a net neutral sentiment. Other than these three main sentiments, there are also two special ones: extreme greed and fear. The former occurs at values above 75, while the latter is under 25. Now, here is what the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index is like right now: As is visible above, the index is sitting at a value of 84. This naturally indicates that investor sentiment is firmly in extreme greed. Historically, Bitcoin and other coins in the sector have tended to move opposite to the majority‚Äôs expectations. The probability of a contrary move also grows the crowd‚Äôs confidence. As such, whenever the Fear & Greed Index has gone too far off into one extreme, a reversal has become likely for BTC. This effect was also witnessed during the top back in March of this year. During that top, the indicator was sitting at 88, which isn‚Äôt much higher than the latest value. Thus, it‚Äôs possible that, at least from the perspective of sentiment, Bitcoin may be starting to become overheated.

With a massive surge in the crypto market, meme coins are driving the bull run. The meme coin market cap has reached $116.94 billion with a trading volume of $74.12 billion.¬†The meme coin craze has officially begun as top meme coins are emerging as the top performers in the crypto market. Among the top performers is PEPE, which has jumped nearly 100% in 24 hours.Furthermore, PEPE has hit a market cap of $10 billion with a new all-time high of $0.00002567. Will this recovery rally extend to a 78% gain, reaching $0.000042? Let‚Äôs take a closer look.PEPE Price AnalysisOn the daily chart, the price action indicates a breakout from a falling channel, signaling a strong recovery rally. The rally began at $0.000007718 and has now reached a new all-time high. Currently, PEPE is up 204% and is trading at $0.00002365.The bull run has surpassed the previous all-time high and the 1.272 Fibonacci extension level at $0.00002145. Notably, the rally has been marked by nine consecutive bullish candles over the past ten days. PEPE Price Chart The surge in bullish momentum has led to a golden crossover between the 200-day and 50-day simple moving averages (SMA). Additionally, the 100-day SMA is showing signs of a bullish reversal, potentially crossing above the 200-day SMA soon.The MACD and signal lines have also surged, supported by a rise in positive histograms, signaling a strong buy signal for PEPE.Coinbase, Robinhood, and Upbit List PEPEThe recent surge in PEPE's price has been significantly influenced by its listings on major exchanges such as Coinbase, Robinhood, and Upbit, South Korea's largest centralized crypto exchange.¬†These listings have substantially increased the meme coin's demand and trading volume. PEPE's 24-hour trading volume has reached $20.67 billion, surpassing its market capitalization of $10 billion, resulting in a volume-to-market cap ratio of approximately 2.¬†Given this, the current PEPE rally can be seen as ""speculative,"" with the high trading volume and elevated market cap suggesting that price movements may be driven by hype.Whale Holds 1.5B PEPE, Sees $33M in ProfitsA giant whale has recently booked profit as the bullish rally in PEPE gains momentum. The whale had bought 2.01 trillion PEPE tokens using 1.17K ETH tokens worth $2.12 million.¬†With this $2 million investment, the whale has earned an estimated $43 million in profits, representing a 20% return. Recently, the whale deposited 500 billion PEPE tokens (worth $11.73 million) onto Coinbase while still holding onto 1.48 trillion PEPE tokens valued at $33.2 million.As the rally continues, especially following PEPE's listings on major exchanges, the whale is likely to hold onto its position.PEPE Price TargetsBased on Fibonacci levels, the recent breakout above the 1.272 extension level suggests the next key target is the 1.618 level, which is priced at $0.000029528.If the broader market continues its bullish momentum, PEPE could potentially reach the $0.000042 level, representing a 78% price increase from its current market value.However, a potential retest of the $0.000021 level or the psychological support at $0.000020 could occur if bullish momentum begins to wane.",POSITIVE,PEPE,ASIA | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | PEPE,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/14/pepe-rally-targets-0-000029528-as-fibonacci-levels-predict-78-extension/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pepe-rally-targets-0-000029528-as-fibonacci-levels-predict-78-extension,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

This SUI ETN adds to VanEck‚Äôs recent blockchain-focused offerings, including ETNs for PYTH and Solana staking, as the company strengthens its presence in the European crypto market. The launch comes at a time when SUI‚Äôs price is surging, attracting investor interest despite some bearish market signals. ETNs , which are similar to ETFs but typically carry higher risk and fewer regulatory constraints, provide investors with an accessible way to engage with blockchain networks like SUI. VanEck Europe‚Äôs crypto product manager, Menno Martens, praised SUI‚Äôs low transaction costs, scalability, and user-friendly design, describing it as a potential alternative to older blockchains. Martijn Rozemuller, VanEck Europe‚Äôs CEO, highlighted SUI‚Äôs fast transaction speeds , calling it a bridge between Web2 and Web3 technologies. This ETN launch is timely, given SUI‚Äôs recent price spike, which hit an all-time high just before the announcement. Although analysts have observed some bearish signs since, market interest remains high, partly fueled by the recent launch of HIPPO, the first SUI-based meme coin. The excitement around VanEck‚Äôs SUI ETN reflects a broader trend in the crypto market, with many assets experiencing bullish momentum. While the long-term outlook for SUI is uncertain, current investor confidence is strong. This latest move is part of VanEck‚Äôs larger ETN strategy in Europe , though the company‚Äôs overarching goals remain unclear.

Known for supporting pro-crypto policies, Thune previously backed efforts to bring crypto regulation under the CFTC rather than the more stringent Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). Thune‚Äôs new role could strengthen the push for CFTC oversight , signaling a shift in Congress toward more supportive crypto regulations. In the past, Thune sponsored legislation to give the CFTC greater control over crypto regulation. The CFTC is generally seen as more accommodating to the industry than the SEC, which has taken a stricter stance on digital assets. With Thune now in a key leadership position, some in the crypto community are hopeful he will use his influence to revive this approach. Thune's leadership aligns with a growing pro-crypto trend in Congress, particularly among Republicans. As part of Trump‚Äôs political agenda, there is also talk of replacing SEC Chair Gary Gensler with someone more favorable to the crypto industry. Gensler‚Äôs potential departure, coupled with Thune‚Äôs influence, could make CFTC oversight of crypto assets more feasible. Additionally, a recent proposal from a Republican Congressman aims to encourage cooperation between the SEC and CFTC on cryptocurrency regulation.

Now among the top 1% of ETFs globally by assets, IBIT‚Äôs rapid success is a testament to the strength of the current crypto market and BlackRock‚Äôs swift acquisition strategy, which included nearly 9,000 BTC purchased in a single day. As Bitcoin prices soar past $93,000 , IBIT‚Äôs growth stands as a key marker in this bull market, highlighting the power of institutional interest in digital assets. According to Bloomberg‚Äôs Eric Balchunas, BlackRock's IBIT achieved a milestone that took other ETFs years. In comparison, the second-fastest ETF to reach $40 billion took 1,253 days‚Äîa record IBIT smashed by reaching that number in one-sixth of the time. The speed and scale of BlackRock‚Äôs Bitcoin acquisitions have also outpaced other ETF issuers. This week, IBIT recorded $230.8 million in fresh inflows, bringing the total to over $1.7 billion in just a few days . Such rapid inflows underline BlackRock's dominant position in the Bitcoin ETF space, a sentiment echoed by industry analysts like Shaun Edmondson, who has observed BlackRock‚Äôs significant influence over recent Bitcoin acquisitions. BlackRock's aggressive approach includes acquiring thousands of Bitcoins in a short span. Just yesterday, U.S. Bitcoin ETFs added 9,300 BTC, of which BlackRock alone bought 8,985. This rush for Bitcoin has led analysts like Edmondson to note that ETFs collectively are nearing the size of Satoshi Nakamoto's holdings. Grayscale, the second-largest Bitcoin holder, in contrast, slightly reduced its BTC holdings over the same period. There‚Äôs little indication of any slowdown in the near term, as Bitcoin‚Äôs price continues to hit record levels. With IBIT closely tied to Bitcoin‚Äôs gains, the ETF's value only grows as it captures the spotlight and attracts attention from both investors and industry watchers.

The company‚Äôs initial foray into the cryptocurrency world in early 2021 inspired other corporations to explore digital assets, marking a milestone in corporate finance. In February 2021, Tesla made waves by buying 43,200 Bitcoins, worth about $1.5 billion, aiming to diversify its cash reserves. This bold purchase followed CEO Elon Musk's support for digital currencies , which subsequently fueled Bitcoin's market price. While Tesla sold a portion of these holdings in May 2021 and again by July 2022, it retained a significant amount, showing sustained belief in Bitcoin's potential. Today, Tesla‚Äôs remaining Bitcoin investment has paid off significantly, reinforcing the company's position. Bitcoin‚Äôs recent price rally, largely driven by institutional interest, has made crypto holdings even more appealing. With Bitcoin prices nearing historic highs, Tesla‚Äôs holdings serve as both a financial asset and an inflation hedge , underscoring the value of cryptocurrency in corporate strategy. Tesla‚Äôs decision to buy Bitcoin not only bolstered its own financials but also influenced the larger crypto market. Many viewed Tesla‚Äôs investment as a sign of endorsement for corporate crypto adoption, encouraging other firms to consider digital assets for financial diversification. Tesla even allowed Bitcoin as a payment method for its vehicles for a brief period, increasing public awareness of crypto‚Äôs potential as a transactional currency. Although it later discontinued this option, the company set a trend for businesses exploring crypto avenues. Today, Tesla‚Äôs $495 million crypto gain highlights the strategic value of Bitcoin as a digital store of value. Its role as an asset has prompted companies worldwide to consider crypto investments, especially as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. As Bitcoin‚Äôs market value grows, more companies may follow Tesla‚Äôs lead, adding crypto to their financial portfolios. Tesla‚Äôs investment demonstrates a shift in corporate finance, reinforcing Bitcoin's appeal as an asset, even as market volatility remains. Tesla‚Äôs confidence in Bitcoin has strengthened its financial profile and continues to influence perceptions of cryptocurrency as a viable corporate asset.

In a tweet yesterday, crypto-focused media outlet ‚ÄòCorleone Alpha News‚Äô shared its analysis of the memecoin market, offering an opinion on the top meme-based assets, including Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).¬†Notably, Corleone suggested that Dogecoin feels old, Floki (FLOKI) lacks excitement, Bonk (BONK) is outdated, and Pepe (PEPE) is expensive. However, the media outlet argued that Shiba Inu does not deliver.¬†This commentary suggested that Shiba Inu failed to deliver gains to investors or meet the expectations of its community.¬†Kusama Reacts¬†As expected, the assessment infuriated Shiba Inu community members, who took to the comment section to express disbelief. Notably, Kusama gave a similar reaction and called for the sack of Corleone‚Äôs content strategist.¬†His commentary indicates that the assessment, particularly for SHIB, was poorly researched.¬†Shiba Inu to Launch SHIB Education Campaign¬†Before now, Kusama believed many people were overlooking Shiba Inu‚Äôs potential and tying its success to the memecoin hype.

Earlier this week, Shiba Inu surged to a seven-month high of $0.00003031 but slumped afterward due to a broader market correction.¬†Despite this retracement, Shiba Inu is currently up 196.7% in the past year, 39.5% in one month, and 5.96% over the last 24 hours.

36293492,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=101355,1731571359,Economist Says Massive XRP Surge Similar to Dogecoin Price Explosion Is Coming,"Crypto analyst and economist Mikybull has asserted that a massive surge for XRP, similar to the recent rise of Dogecoin (DOGE), is underway. Mikybull shared this optimism in a tweet on Monday. At the time, XRP's price action was relatively stagnant, while Dogecoin made waves in the crypto market with its impressive price rally. For context, on November 3, Dogecoin sold at $0.1428, but nine days later, it had surged 205.25%, reaching $0.4359.Notably, Dogecoin hadn't traded above $0.4 since June 2021. In less than two weeks, The meme coin added over $43 billion to its market cap, surpassing USDC stablecoin and XRP in market rankings. With XRP seeing a less comparable surge, the gap between Dogecoin and XRP widened as the meme coin's bull run continued.Despite XRP's underperformance during Dogecoin's surge, Mikybull expressed optimism about XRP's potential. XRP Projected Price if It Rallies Like DogecoinHe argued that XRP is setting the stage for a major rally, similar to Dogecoin‚Äôs recent rise, with a price target of $2 by the end of 2024.At the time of the forecast, XRP was trading around $0.5925. Remarkably, it has since surged by 24%, reaching $0.7354. This marked its highest price in eight months. However, the seventh-largest crypto asset faced resistance that has prevented it from reclaiming the $0.74 level, the yearly high it set earlier in March. As of now, XRP is trading at $0.674.Market watchers are hopeful that, based on recent price action, XRP could soon break through the three-year resistance level of $1 , possibly as early as Friday.In a follow-up update on XRP's price action, Mikybull reiterated his bullish outlook, stating that XRP is primed for a ""giga send."" He pointed to the breakout from the downtrend on the RSI as a key sign of strength. Mikybull reiterated that the recent movement only strengthens his conviction that XRP is set to rally in a manner similar to Dogecoin.XRP Enthusiasts Push for Higher Price TargetWhile Mikybull‚Äôs $2 end-of-year target has garnered attention, some XRP enthusiasts are more ambitious. One such enthusiast, Gauda, argued that if XRP rallies like Dogecoin, it could soar to $20 rather than just $2. Gauda pointed out that $2 would still be well below XRP‚Äôs previous all-time high, urging Mikybull to adopt a more optimistic outlook.",POSITIVE,DOGE | XRP,DOGE | MARKET | TRADING | XRP | TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/14/economist-says-massive-xrp-surge-similar-to-dogecoin-price-explosion-is-coming/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=economist-says-massive-xrp-surge-similar-to-dogecoin-price-explosion-is-coming,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Today, the asset has achieved a new all-time high of roughly $93,477. This ATH was achieved not long ago following an earlier dip today to $85,000.

Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Now Overheating? Key Metrics Reveal Crucial Insights For Investors Bitcoin Finally At Its Peak? Amid the price surge in BTC, market analysts have offered their perspectives on Bitcoin‚Äôs potential trajectory. Crazzyblockk, a CryptoQuant analyst, addressed questions regarding whether Bitcoin has reached its peak by evaluating market profitability indicators. According to Crazzyblockk, two key metrics are essential for assessing Bitcoin‚Äôs profitability: the number of Bitcoin addresses currently in profit and the overall profitability rate for these addresses. The analyst observed that nearly all Bitcoin addresses are profitable, indicating heightened market risk. However, he also noted that current profit margins across different holding periods remain below those observed during previous bull markets, such as the 2019-2020 and 2021 uptrends, where profit margins reached 800-900%. Despite concerns about potential short-term price corrections due to elevated market risks, Crazzyblockk expressed confidence in Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term upward trajectory. He emphasized that strategies such as Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) and maintaining a long-term investment approach could benefit capital growth in this environment. More Room For Gains? In a separate analysis, CryptoQuant analyst Avocado Onchain highlighted miner activity and its implications for Bitcoin‚Äôs price movement. Avocado noted that some Bitcoin miners have already begun taking profits, but this does not necessarily indicate a weakening of Bitcoin‚Äôs overall upward potential. He pointed to the Miner Position Index (MPI), which tracks Bitcoin outflows from miners‚Äô wallets relative to the annual average. A high MPI suggests increased miner selling activity, which can signal that Bitcoin‚Äôs price may be approaching a cycle peak. Related Reading: Short-Term Bitcoin Holders Move Millions To Binance‚ÄîIs A Market Correction Imminent? So far, recent data showed a slight increase in MPI as Bitcoin reached new all-time highs. Avocado explained that this could represent early positioning for the next market cycle. By converting MPI to a 30-day moving average, clearer signals emerge regarding market cycles. The analyst identified patterns of profit-taking by miners near cycle tops, often followed by subsequent price increases and, eventually, longer-term downtrends. Avocado Onchain also highlighted additional data supporting the potential for further Bitcoin price growth. The hashrate and mining difficulty, key indicators of mining activity and network security, have reached new highs, reflecting strong miner participation and overall network health. This data, combined with continued market interest and growing liquidity, suggests that Bitcoin‚Äôs price could experience further upside in this cycle, as suggested by Avocado‚Äôs analysis.

Meanwhile, 56% of respondents said they expect to change their outlook to bullish within a year, while some already turned optimistic from bullish as bitcoin {{BTC}} recently hit all-time highs.  BTC has risen over 20% in seven days, setting new highs above $93,000 on optimism that President-elect Donald Trump would offer regulatory clarity to the digital assets industry. On a year-to-date basis, prices are up over 110%, with the January debut of U.S.-listed spot ETFs drawing in billions in investor money.  Over 70% of the survey respondents said these ETFs have increased their confidence in the asset class. Nearly 30% said that digital assets are superior to traditional investments.  Preferred strategies  More than half of respondents had over 10% of their funds in crypto, while nearly 46% considered boosting allocation in the next six months, while 36% planned to maintain the status quo, awaiting the optimal market entry.  Single token investments, or purchasing and holding a single cryptocurrency rather than diversifying into several ones, remained the preferred strategy for 44% of respondents, followed by 40% for actively managed exposure.  Layer-1 blockchains remained the highest area of interest, followed by Web3 infrastructure and DeFi. Tokenization of equity, corporate bonds and mutual funds are now more popular than real estate, which topped the charts in 2023.  Entry barriers  Traditionally, stringent fiduciary responsibilities, investment mandates, and limited access to properly regulated crypto asset custodians were primary entry barriers for investors seeking exposure to digital assets.  However, with 69% of respondents perceiving increased regulatory clarity, asset volatility has become the primary concern, followed by security and custody worries.  For 81% of respondents, access to better information would have them consider boosting allocation. It's a sign that the focus is now more on market-specific risks, strategic planning and in-depth research of technology rather than just regulatory issues, the report said.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | SPONSORED | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/11/14/institutions-go-all-in-on-crypto-sygnum-survey-reveals-57-respondents-plan-to-boost-allocations,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/eb853c91d9b2c273b6db46b656cc68e0e49c40f4-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

His crypto investment scheme on Telegram, Crypto Paradise Island, was under investigation by authorities.  A dead body discovered in the √éle-de-la-Visitation park in Montreal, Canada on Oct. 30 has been identified as missing ‚Äúcrypto influencer‚Äù Kevin Mirshahi, according to a Nov. 12 report from the Montreal Gazette.  The 25-year-old has been missing since he was abducted along with three others from a condo in the city on June 21. The other abductees, two women and one man, were located by police hours later. In August, Joanie Lepage, 32, was charged with first-degree murder of Mirshahi and the abduction of Mirshahi and the three others. It is not known if her actions are linked to Mirshahi‚Äôs cryptocurrency ventures.  At the time of his disappearance, Mirshahi ran a crypto investment scheme called Crypto Paradise Island, a paid-for Telegram group offering investment advice.  But it was also implicated in a pump and dump scheme involving a token called Marsan ($MRS) that saw its 2,300 members - many between the ages of 16 and 20 - lose thousands of dollars, according to Le Journal de Montr√©al. Created by Antoine Marsan and Bastien Francoeur through their company Marsan Exchange, the token launched April 14, 2021. They paid Mirshahi in the token to promote it.  Marsan peaked in value at Canadian dollar $5.14 ($3.67) three days after launch, but on April 18, two large holders cashed out and the value collapsed to $0.39.  As a result, Mirshahi and his company had been under investigation by Quebec‚Äôs investment regulator, the Autorit√© des march√©s financiers (AMF), since 2021. He was also under a ‚Äúban on carrying out any activity as a broker or investment adviser, a ban on securities transactions and orders for the withdrawal of publications on social media and the withdrawal of the name of the AMF‚Äù, which had most recently been extended on July 4 this year.  Further reporting by Le Journal de Montr√©al indicates that despite the ban, he continued to run a Telegram group promoting cryptocurrency investments with the name ‚ÄúAmir.""  The announcement that his body had been discovered came a week after another cryptocurrency-linked kidnapping in Toronto. Dean Skurka, CEO of publicly listed crypto holding company WonderFi, was forced into a car by assailants who then demanded a ransom of nearly $720,660. He was released after paying the money.  But it‚Äôs not just Canada that has seen an uptick of physical crime involving cryptocurrency. A list maintained by co-founder and Chief Security Officer of Casa, Jameson Lopp has recorded 18 attacks with links to cryptocurrency this year.

Is it Following the Nasdaq-to-S&P 500 Ratio?,"BTC's price fades the spike above the trendline off the twin peaks from 2021, following the pattern in the NDX/SPX ratio.  BTC has been positive correlated with the ratio since at least 2017.  Bitcoin's {{BTC}} price soared to a record of $93,445 late Wednesday but has since retreated to hover around that all-important resistance level of $90,000. This level is identified by a trendline connecting the twin peaks from 2021, making it a key point to watch.  Interestingly, a similar trend has played out in the Nasdaq-to-S&P 500 (NDX/SPX) ratio, which is widely seen as a gauge of investor risk appetite in traditional and emerging technology sectors. Since 2017, this ratio has led bitcoin through its ups and downs, and CoinDesk first highlighted this pattern in April 2023, emphasizing a solid positive correlation between the two. Back then, the ratio was in an uptrend, offering bullish cues to BTC, which traded below $30,000.  Fast forward to July, the NDX/SPX ratio peaked at new highs, right above the critical trendline joining the twin peaks from 2021, sending positive signals to bitcoin. But since then, the ratio has taken a step back, settling below the trendline again.  So, as of now, it looks like bitcoin is following movements in the NDX/SPX ratio, just like it has for years. If this pattern holds, we might see BTC settle below $90,000 for a bit longer. The shenanigans in the options market suggest the same.  On the flip side, a renewed upswing in the NDX/SPX ratio would be a green signal for the bulls to go all in and take prices into six figures.

36273788,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=652975,1731560400,Toncoin Liquidity and User Activity Reviewed by Analyst: Insights on Market Impacts,"Toncoin (TON) has seen notable changes in its market dynamics so far, driven by supply variations and heightened user engagement across its ecosystem. Particularly, according to a recent analysis by CryptoQuant analyst Shiven Moodley, TON‚Äôs total supply has steadily grown, moving from approximately 5.01 billion tokens to around 5.1 billion tokens. This growth, however, comes alongside significant changes in the circulating supply, particularly marked by a sharp decline in early 2024, attributed to lockups and staking activities within the network. The changes in circulating supply, according to Moodley, reflect TON‚Äôs evolving liquidity in the market and the increasing trend of users committing to staking and long-term holding. Related Reading: Toncoin Sharpe Ratio Is Falling: What It Means And ‚Äî Is It Time To Buy? Layer One And Layer Two Comparisons: TON‚Äôs Position And Future Outlook Moodley‚Äôs analysis also highlighted that activities within the TON ecosystem, notably on the Masterchain and Workchain, are pivotal in driving user engagement. Specifically, apps and games hosted on the workchain, such as Hamster Kombat, DOGS, and Catizen, have been central to boosting increased trading activity. Moodley delved into TON‚Äôs comparative positioning among other prominent altcoins and blockchain ecosystems. He pointed out that over the past six months, TON transactions have maintained a relatively consistent pace, with occasional spikes linked to airdrops for games on the network. This steady transaction activity positions TON as a ‚Äústrong layer-one blockchain network‚Äù with notable consistency compared to its closest competitor, Arbitrum. The CryptoQuant analyst noted: This growing user base would likely switch trader psychology towards holding over the medium to long term, reducing market liquidity in the TON ecosystem. Notably, this shift of potentially reduced market liquidity within the TON ecosystem, as suggested by Moodley, could come as more users opt to stake their tokens and engage in network activities over extended periods. Toncoin Market Performance Toncoin has¬†benefited from the¬†ongoing bull run in the market so far. In the past week, the altcoin has seen a major price and market capitalization increase, jumping by more than 15%. This double-digit increase in the past week has seen TON‚Äôs market cap¬†reach above $13.8 billion, and its price¬†trading for¬†$5.41, at the time of writing, has risen¬†by 1.4% in the past day. Interestingly, despite this increase, TON‚Äôs daily volume, after being valued above $1 million on November 12 seems to have cooled off with a current valuation of $679 million. Related Reading: Toncoin Sharpe Ratio Rising, Is TON Readying For $8? Regardless, many in the crypto community are still optimistic about the altcoin. For instance, a renowned crypto analyst CryptoBullet on X has recently predicted a $12 to $15 target for Toncoin. $TON #Toncoin Macro chart (chart request) I like the fact that #TON is testing prior Resistance for Support now.

The next major resistance is near the $0.4150 level. A close above the $0.4150 resistance might send the price toward the $0.4320 resistance.

The price tested the $0.7450 zone and is currently correcting gains. XRP price started a decent increase above the $0.6320 resistance. The price is now trading above $0.6450 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $0.6280 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it stays above the $0.6160 support zone. XRP Price Eyes More Upsides XRP price remained supported above the $0.600 level. It formed a base and started a fresh increase above $0.6200. It outperformed Bitcoin and Ethereum in the past two sessions, with a move above the $0.6320 resistance. The price even climbed above the $0.7320 level before the bears appeared. A high was formed at $0.7488 before there was a pullback. The price dipped below $0.7200 and tested $0.700. It tested the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.6419 swing low to the $0.7488 high. The price is now trading above $0.6320 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support at $0.6280 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $0.7220 level. The first major resistance is near the $0.7480 level. The next key resistance could be $0.7550. A clear move above the $0.7550 resistance might send the price toward the $0.7780 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.7950 resistance or even $0.800 in the near term. The next major hurdle might be $0.8220. Another Drop? If XRP fails to clear the $0.7220 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.6820 level. The next major support is near the $0.6670 level and the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.6419 swing low to the $0.7488 high. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.6670 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $0.6160 support in the near term. The next major support sits near the $0.600 zone.

Republicans already won the White House with Donald Trump's reelection, and flipped several Senate seats for a majority in the chamber of Congress during last week's election. The Associated Press projected that the party secured at least 218 seats late Wednesday.  The House of Representatives has been the legislative body to move most crypto legislation at the federal level, particularly in the last year after multiple crypto-focused bills were passed by a majority of the body's 435 lawmakers. Republicans held a slim majority in the House during that time, but Democrats were expected to flip it during the 2024 election.  However, Republicans clinched it with the election of Juan Ciscomani in Arizona, giving the party enough seats for a majority. Republicans lead in a handful of other races as well as of press time, and may hold up to 222 seats if current results hold. The party is about to lose a few lawmakers, with Trump naming Representatives Matt Gaetz, Elise Stefanik and Mike Waltz to executive branch roles, meaning they'll have to resign their seats. Gaetz, who Trump said would be his nominee for Attorney General, already sent his resignation letter ""effective immediately.""  The Fairshake super political action committee and its affiliated PACs, Protect Progress and Defend American Jobs, provided financial backing to nearly 60 House and Senate candidates in the 2024 election, with the vast majority winning their races.  Fairshake largely backed candidates in safe districts during the primary season, ensuring that the candidates they backed would coast to wins in the general election.  The handful of races their candidates were unsuccessful include seats in Colorado, where a Republican defeated Democrat Yadira Caraveio, and California, where a Democrat defeated Republican Mike Garcia.  Fairshake candidates trailed in at least two other races as of press time, but the PACs have notched over 50 wins, perhaps most notably in Ohio's Senate race. Sen. Sherrod Brown lost to Republican challenger Bernie Moreno, a car salesman and entrepreneur who received $40 million worth of backing from Fairshake.  Retiring Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), who chaired the House Financial Services Committee, spearheaded the passage of the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), a market structure bill that would have defined how different types of crypto assets should be regulated by U.S. agencies. The House also passed an overturn of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's Staff Accounting Bulletin 121, a controversial policy dictating how financial institutions must report any digital assets they hold for customers.  The SAB 121 resolution was passed through the Senate but later vetoed by President Joe Biden. The FIT21 bill did not receive a vote in the Senate.  California Democrat Maxine Waters remains the ranking member of the Financial Services Committee, while Republicans have to choose who will lead their caucus on the committee. Reps. Andy Barr (R-Ky.), Frank Lucas (R-Okla.), French Hill (R-Ark.) and Bill Huizenga (R-Mich.) are some of the lawmakers vying for that role.  Waters has been working on a stablecoin bill with Patrick McHenry, the retiring chair of the committee, for the last few years.

Here‚Äôs what it means for the asset. XRP NVT Ratio Reached A High Of 1,162 Earlier In The Month In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, analyst Maartunn has discussed about how the latest trend in the NVT Ratio of XRP has been like. The ‚ÄúNVT Ratio‚Äù here refers to an indicator that keeps track of the ratio between the market cap of the asset and its transaction volume (both in USD). Related Reading: Dogecoin Explodes 150% As Shark & Whale Buying Returns When the value of this metric is high, it means the value of the network (represented by its market cap) is high compared to its ability to transact coins (measured by its volume). Such a trend could imply the asset may be overvalued. On the other hand, the indicator being low suggests the market cap isn‚Äôt inflated when compared to the transaction volume, so the asset‚Äôs price could be due a rebound to the upside. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the XRP NVT Ratio over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the XRP NVT Ratio has witnessed some spikes recently, with a particularly large one having come on the 2nd of this month. These recent highs in the indicator would imply the market cap of the coin isn‚Äôt being justified by its volume. Over the last week, the asset has registered a jump of more than 25% in its price, but if volume doesn‚Äôt catch up soon, it‚Äôs possible that the rally would run out of steam before long. Something else that could be a danger to the XRP run is an excess of Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO) developing among the investors. According to data from the analytics firm Santiment, a couple of FOMO indicators related to the the asset have seen a surge recently. The metrics in question are the Binance Funding Rate and the Social Dominance. The former of these keeps track of the ratio between the long and short positions present on the cryptocurrency exchange Binance, while the latter measures the percentage of social media discussions related to the top 100 cryptocurrencies that XRP alone is contributing. Below is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows how these metrics have changed for the coin recently. From the graph, it‚Äôs apparent that traders on Binance have opened a massive amount of long positions alongside the price surge as the Funding Rate has turned highly positive. Related Reading: Ethereum Could Be Set To Explore New Highs As On-Chain Metrics Light Up The Social Dominance has also seen an uplift of its own, with XRP-related discussions making up for more than 4% of social media discussions around the cryptocurrency sector. Both of these can point to the presence of excessive hype in the market, which is something that has historically led to a top for the asset. XRP Price XRP had surged to a high of $0.74 yesterday, but it appears the coin has seen a pullback since then as its price is now floating around $0.67.

ETFs like BITW mitigate operational and regulatory risks compared to unregulated crypto exchanges, focusing solely on market risk for retail investors. BITW outperforms Bitcoin in rallies, up 56% in the past month, but carries high volatility with a 61% standard deviation and 64% annualized volatility. BITW serves as a diversification tool in the crypto space, ideal for investors seeking to increase risk/reward during bullish markets. Thesis While we are still amazed by the advent of the crypto universe, its establishment as an asset class cannot be debated. And just like any asset class, crypto has established players and high beta ones. Bitcoin and Ether are the two largest and most established cryptocurrencies, while the crypto universe has a plethora of other coins. The main difference between the established players and the secondary ones is represented by volatility and beta factor. With the significant rally in cryptocurrencies in the past two weeks, we are going to show retail investors how they can take advantage of exchange traded instruments which offer access to higher beta names in the crypto world. Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund ETF ( BITW ) is an exchange-traded fund that does just that, via a regulated and robust structure versus crypto exchange investing. Structure matters - ETFs over crypto exchanges Let us start with the basics - while ETFs are established capital markets instruments, crypto exchanges are a different breed : Centralized cryptocurrency exchanges act as an intermediary between a buyer and a seller and make money through commissions and transaction fees. You can imagine a CEX to be similar to a stock exchange but for digital assets. Popular Crypto Exchanges are Binance, Coinbase Exchange, Kraken and KuCoin. Much like stock trading websites or apps, these exchanges allow cryptocurrency investors to buy and sell digital assets at the prevailing price, called spot, or to leave orders that get executed when the asset gets to the investor‚Äôs desired price target, called limit orders. Unlike established capital markets exchanges though, crypto exchanges are most of the time unregulated, thus subject to a plethora of risk factors, including operational risk factors and outright fraud. As the FTX bankruptcy taught us, even the most recognized names in crypto can turn out to have fraudulent aspects to them. Traditional capital markets exchanges, on the other hand, have been around for almost a century, and are heavily regulated by their respective oversight bodies. Take the New York Stock Exchange as an example: As a registered securities exchange, NYSE National is subject to the regulatory oversight of the SEC and all rules and amendments must be filed with and approved by the SEC pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder. From this section, a retail investor needs to understand that trading crypto via an unregulated exchange is fraught with risks, in addition to the usual market risks faced when purchasing a security. For that very reason, we are much more inclined to invest in crypto via ETFs or CEFs, instruments traded on regulated exchanges. Via this method of investing, an investor only takes market risk. What does BITW hold? A mixed portfolio of cryptos, but overweight Bitcoin and Ether. Let us start with the fund definition first: The Fund seeks to track an Index comprised of the 10 most highly valued cryptocurrencies, screened and monitored for certain risks, weighted by market capitalization, and rebalanced monthly. The fund provides the security and simplicity of a traditional investment vehicle. Currently, the fund is overweight Bitcoin and Ether: Holdings (Fund Website) Via the current market weighted composition, the fund has over 90% of its holdings in Bitcoin and Ether. The other significant fund components are Solana and XRP. Given its market capitalization build, do expect the two largest players to always have a meaningful weighting here. Nonetheless, a retail investor also gets access to higher beta plays. Unlike crypto exchanges where an investor can choose outright the individual currencies they want to trade, BITW provides for a third-party methodology based way to access the 10 most highly valued cryptos (as per the BITW methodology, which can be downloaded here ). What a retail investor should take away from this section is that BITW is an easy way to access a universe of 10 large liquid cryptos, with a market capitalization approach to the fund build. BITW is a higher beta play when compared to bitcoin outright When looking at returns, BITW shakes-out to be a high beta play in crypto when compared to Bitcoin outright: Performance (Seeking Alpha) Given its composition, the fund tends to have larger moves both to the downside and to the upside. While its correlation to bitcoin outright is very high, we can notice how BITW overshoots during sell-offs and also outperforms during rallies. In the past month, BITW is up +56% while BITO is up 'only' +30% from a total return perspective. Investors expecting the crypto rally to continue into year-end should expect high beta plays to outperform. Retail investors, however, need to be warned that BITW is truly a 'high beta' name. Suffice to look at the Seeking Alpha Risk page: Risk Metrics (Seeking Alpha) The one year standard deviation is 61% and the annualized volatility is 64%. Keep in mind the same figures for the S&P 500 are around 12%. The risks are tremendous here, but also the rewards, with BITW being up over +130% in the past twelve months. A building block for an emergent asset class We would like to think of BITW as a building block for the emergent crypto asset class. While we now have Bitcoin and Ether ETFs, more will follow (we believe). However, many cryptos will have issues around liquidity, build and tradability which will prevent them from ever being packaged via ETFs. To that end, a retail investor wanting to consolidate all investing in a brokerage account will need to use building blocks such as BITW. As highlighted above, we consider BITW as a high beta play in the crypto space, and we would go long only when wanting to increase the risk/reward ratio in the crypto space. While being more of a blunt instrument via the low amount of cryptocurrencies that can be introduced in its build, the fund does serve the purpose of diversification and layering in of beta during bull markets. Risk factors There are numerous risk factors in the crypto world, starting with operational risk (i.e. including hacking here) and ending with fundamental valuation concerns. Cryptos do not generate cash flows or earnings, and in our view are a momentum play for bull markets. However, investors have taken a liking in the asset class, and with more cash being allocated to the sector it is not an investment instrument that can be ignored. In our opinion trying to eliminate operational and regulatory risk and only focusing on market risk is the correct approach here, which is largely achieved via ETF investing. Conclusion BITW is an exchange-traded fund focused on the largest ten cryptocurrencies. The name is overweight bitcoin and ether, currencies which make up over 90% of the fund. The ETF is up over +56% in the past month, representing a high beta play in the crypto space, and outperforming bitcoin outright. The ETF circumvents many of the risk factors associated with investing via a crypto exchange, but at the same time provides for no flexibility in choosing what cryptos are introduces in the holdings. We view the name as a high beta building block in the crypto space, and investors looking for the crypto rally to continue into the year-end would be well served to look at BITW in addition to bitcoin outright.",POSITIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4737154-bitw-high-beta-crypto-play-in-an-etf-format?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/36268490.jpeg
36267884,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=652952,1731551456,"Bitcoin Price Could Peak In 200 Days, Before US Recession In Mid-2025, Report Says","The current Bitcoin (BTC) rally could extend until mid-2025, with a potential price peak before a US recession. Bitcoin Could Peak In Mid-2025 Before US Recession A recent Copper Research report, a recent¬†crypto research firm, posits¬†that the leading cryptocurrency by market cap could extend its bullish momentum until mid-2025. Related Reading: Bitcoin Data Reveals Bulls Are Growing But Still Behind March 2024 Peak ‚Äì Details As of November 13, Bitcoin is on day 555 of its current market cycle, and a price peak for the digital asset could arrive within the next 200 days. Notably, this peak may coincide with a potential US recession forecasted for mid-2025. According to the report, Bitcoin‚Äôs market cycles average 756 days. The starting point of these cycles is when the annual average growth of Bitcoin‚Äôs market capitalization turns positive, while the endpoint is when it hits a price peak. The report marks the beginning of the current market cycle around mid-2023, just before asset manager BlackRock filed for a BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF). Should Bitcoin stay true to its historical price patterns, the digital asset can hit its price peak for this cycle sometime around mid-2025. The report cites estimates by JPMorgan about the likelihood of a US recession in mid-2025. As a result, BTC‚Äôs price peak might align with a potential US economic downturn. Based on data from Treasury spreads, JPMorgan gives a 45% chance of a potential US recession by mid-2025. The report further highlights the gap between BTC‚Äôs price top and realized volatility. For the uninitiated, realized volatility measures BTC‚Äôs price fluctuations over a specific period, showing the standard deviation of the asset‚Äôs returns from the market‚Äôs mean return. BTC‚Äôs realized volatility currently stands at around 50%, indicating that its volatility is only halfway to previous bull market peaks. Another bullish technical indicator for the BTC price trajectory is its filtered relative strength index (RSI). The report reads: Currently, the RSI sits at 60 ‚Äì well below previous bull market highs ‚Äì indicating considerable room for Bitcoin to continue building momentum into the new year. BTC Could Rise Further, But Caution Is Necessary The digital assets market has been on a strong upward trend since pro-crypto Donald Trump‚Äôs victory in the 2024 US presidential election. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETFs See Historic Surge ‚Äì Institutions Go Bullish On BTC With $1.38 Billion Record Inflows Notably, the emerging industry has witnessed its total market cap surge beyond $3 trillion for the first time since November 2021. The rise in total crypto market cap ‚Äì largely driven by BTC ‚Äì is not surprising since the Trump administration is speculated to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve akin to that of El Salvador under Nayib Bukele. Bitcoin‚Äôs unprecedented price action has propelled the digital asset‚Äôs total market cap beyond that of silver, solidifying it as the 8th largest global asset by market cap in existence. With this in mind, it will be interesting to see how BTC dominance (BTC.D) behaves in the coming weeks, especially after facing rejection just below the $90,000 level. Currently hovering slightly above 60%, a fall in BTC.D could signal a capital rotation from BTC into altcoins, potentially benefiting smaller-cap digital assets. BTC trades at $87,767 at press time, up 1.1% in the past 24 hours. The asset‚Äôs total market cap sits at $1.738 trillion.

According to recent data from the event contract market, 60% of users believe Bitcoin will hit this milestone before January, while 45% are betting it could achieve this level as early as November. Analyst Predicts Six-Figure Bitcoin Prices By Year-End Kalshi, which launched in 2021, allows users to bet on various outcomes, including economic data releases and election results. The platform gained significant attention this year due to its legal battle with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which ultimately led to US users being allowed to participate in betting markets for the presidential election. Since the US presidential election on November 5, Bitcoin has surged more than 28%. The election outcome has been viewed as bullish for cryptocurrencies, especially with President-elect Donald Trump expressing his support for the industry and hinting at more favorable regulations. Related Reading: Justin Drake Unveils ‚ÄòThe Beam Chain‚Äô: A Vision For Ethereum Final Design Analyst Mike Colonnese from H.C. Wainwright commented on the current market conditions, stating: Strong positive sentiment is likely to persist through the balance of 2024, and we see Bitcoin prices potentially reaching the six-figure mark by the end of this year. The analyst further noted that Bitcoin is now in a phase of ‚Äúprice discovery‚Äù after breaking through its all-time highs early last Wednesday morning, following the official announcement of Trump‚Äôs election victory. This combination of market enthusiasm and regulatory optimism, he suggests, could see BTC continue its upward trajectory, attracting new investors and cementing its place in the financial landscape by the end of 2024. UBS Warns Of Historical Volatility Although betting markets and investors have set their sights on BTC hitting $100,000, Wall Street analysts are warning about the ‚Äúspeculative‚Äù nature of cryptocurrencies. Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer for the Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, emphasized this point in a note to clients on Tuesday. ‚ÄúWe continue to view crypto assets as a speculative trade rather than a strategic investment in portfolios,‚Äù she stated. Marcelli expressed skepticism regarding the potential for digital assets to make significant inroads into disruptive real-world applications, noting their propensity to increase portfolio volatility. UBS highlighted that since 2014, Bitcoin has experienced three major drawdowns exceeding 70%, with an average recovery period of three years. Related Reading: Analyst Warns Of 10% Bitcoin Price Drop Ahead Of CPI Data On a more positive note, other cryptocurrencies saw gains on Wednesday. Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and even Dogecoin (DOGE) experienced upward movement. Dogecoin surged notably after Trump announced that Tesla CEO Elon Musk and former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy would head a newly formed ‚ÄúDepartment of Government Efficiency,‚Äù cleverly abbreviated to DOGE. However, crypto-related equities did not follow the bullish trend of Bitcoin. Stocks like Coinbase (COIN) and Robinhood (HOOD) took a breather after recent rallies, with Coinbase shares down about 2% on Wednesday, while Robinhood remained relatively unchanged. After hitting a new all-time high of $93,000 on Wednesday, BTC has come back down to the $90,350 level, yet, still up 20% on the week.

This volatility showcases the potential and unpredictability surrounding LINK‚Äôs recent price action, drawing attention from analysts and investors alike. According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, there‚Äôs a notable trend unfolding beneath the surface: Chainlink whales have been steadily accumulating LINK over the past two months. This accumulation by large holders suggests a growing conviction in LINK‚Äôs long-term value, reinforcing a bullish outlook for the asset. Related Reading: Bitcoin Weekly RSI Entering Power Zone ‚Äì Last Time BTC Soared 80% Martinez‚Äôs data underscores this trend, highlighting that whales are continuing to add LINK to their portfolios despite the recent ups and downs in price. This activity suggests a solid foundation of support at current levels, as whales often act as market stabilizers. The coming weeks are expected to be pivotal for LINK, as further accumulation by large holders could fuel another upward move. Investors are now watching closely as Chainlink‚Äôs price action could signal a broader shift in sentiment within the DeFi and Oracle sectors. Whether LINK will continue to build on this bullish momentum or enter a period of consolidation remains to be seen. Chainlink Waking Up Smart Money Chainlink has recently posted an impressive surge, aligning with the broader market‚Äôs rally as bullish sentiment resurfaces across the crypto space. Key data from crypto analyst Ali Martinez indicates a strong accumulation pattern among Chainlink whales, who have amassed over 15 million LINK in the past two months‚Äîan investment valued at around $165 million. This substantial accumulation suggests high confidence among large holders, who appear committed to backing LINK despite its inherent price volatility. While many altcoins have benefited from a wave of retail-driven speculation, Chainlink‚Äôs recent surge seems to be fueled by more than short-term market excitement. The active participation of whales, typically seen as more strategic investors, indicates a solid support base at current levels. Martinez‚Äôs analysis highlights that the trend of accumulation by whales has been steady, even amid price fluctuations, which often signals confidence in longer-term potential. Related Reading: Dogecoin Could Target $2.4 If Price Aligns With Macro Pattern ‚Äì Details However, the next few weeks will be telling. Analysts and investors closely monitor whether this accumulation trend will continue or if it was a temporary push to capitalize on favorable market conditions. Sustained buying by whales would likely bolster LINK‚Äôs price further, reinforcing that Chainlink‚Äôs network and utility as a decentralized oracle provider hold significant value in the evolving blockchain ecosystem. Conversely, if accumulation slows, LINK could see a period of consolidation as the market recalibrates. Key Levels To Watch Chainlink is trading at $13.3 after reaching a local high of $15.3, marking a significant move that has renewed investors‚Äô optimism. In this recent rally, LINK broke above the 200-day moving average (MA) at $12.8, a critical level often seen as a key indicator of long-term market sentiment. To confirm this bullish momentum, LINK needs to hold this 200-day MA as a support level; if successful, it would reinforce the bullish price structure and signal the potential for further gains. Holding above $12.8 would set a strong foundation for LINK‚Äôs price action, suggesting that buyers have established control and are willing to defend current levels. Related Reading: Cardano Skyrockets Over 40% ‚Äì Funding Rate Suggests Further Upside If this support holds, LINK could make a sustained push above its recent local high at $15.3. Analysts anticipate that a confirmed breakout would open the door for LINK to test higher resistance levels, with the potential for a strong continuation in the coming weeks. However, if LINK fails to hold the 200-day MA, the price may retest lower support areas, potentially disrupting the bullish momentum. For now, all eyes remain on $12.8 as LINK attempts to solidify its recent gains and prepare for a possible run higher.
