The DoJ charged Alla Witte (aka Max), 55, with 19 counts of a 47-count indictment, accusing her of participating in the “Trickbot Group,” which operates in Russia, Belarus, the Ukraine and Suriname, the small country on South America’s northeast coast.  The ransomware notified victims their computers were encrypted and they would have to buy special software through a bitcoin address that the ""Trickbot Group"" controlled to decrypt their files.  Witte allegedly provided code to the ""Trickbot Group"" that tracked authorized users of the malware and developed tools and protocols to store stolen login credentials from the users.  The group targeted computers belonging to individuals and organizations in northern Ohio, where the charges were filed in U.S. District Court, and elsewhere in the U.S.  The FBI, which conducted the investigation, arrested Witte in Miami on Feb. 6.  “'Trickbot' infected millions of victim computers worldwide and was used to harvest banking credentials and deliver ransomware,” said Deputy Attorney General Lisa O.

Youssef said the number of transactions on Paxful in Africa, combined with Google searches primarily from Nigeria, reflect the “tremendous momentum” around cryptocurrency adoption.      “Africa's leading [in] global cryptocurrency adoption,” he said.      According to data shared with CoinDesk, Nigeria is Paxful’s biggest market to date, with around 1.5 million users and $1.5 billion in trade volume. Thanks to Nigeria’s tricky exchange rate policy, inflation and large number of unbanked adults, cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are increasingly used as an alternative store-of-value.      Earlier this year, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) ordered local banking institutions to identify and shut down any accounts tied to crypto platforms. The order was met with a swift backlash and the CBN has somewhat eased its position since then. However, Nigerian users quickly switched to trading on peer-to-peer platforms like Paxful to avoid interacting with local banks.      “This is just the harbinger of things to come. We're only starting to see what Africa is capable of,” Youssef said, referring to how young Nigerians have built their own alternative financial networks.      Youssef added that in addition to leading markets like Nigeria, new markets are “blowing up” every day. He expects Cameroon and Ethiopia to be strong contenders for emerging crypto markets in the next few years.      A representative for Paxful told CoinDesk that, in Kenya, the platform expects to see 120% growth in users and 142% growth in trading volumes this year based on linear projections from 2020. The company also expects to see 72% growth in users and 84% growth in trading volumes in Ghana.      “People ask me why I am so crazy about Africa,” Youssef said. “Well, the reason is, I've been there, I've met the people, I've seen the problems that they have. It makes perfect sense once you're there.”",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/06/04/africa-is-leading-global-cryptocurrency-adoption-paxful-ceo,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a78d4e708054760d087b38d1b4d771c2db552370-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42386974,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBW87N,1622838823,Market Wrap: Musk-Induced Sell-Off Spurs Crypto Price Drop Before a Slight Recovery,"A bearish tweet from Elon Musk wiped out some long positions, providing some market uncertainty on direction heading into the weekend.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $36,826 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Losing 4.4% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $35,814-$39,211 (CoinDesk 20)  Ether (ETH) trading around $2,684 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). In the red 3.8% over the previous 24 hours.  Ether’s 24-hour range: $2,566-$2,866 (CoinDesk 20)  Bitcoin affected by Musk, again    Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was down Friday by 4.4% as of press time. It was near the 10-hour moving average and below the 50-hour, a sideways-to-bearish signal for market technicians.      BTC’s price plunged from $39,211 at 00:00 UTC (8:00 p.m. ET Thursday) to $35,814 by 15:15 UTC (8:15 a.m. ET) Friday, an 8.6% dump based on CoinDesk 20 data. Bitcoin then recovered somewhat, at $36,826 as of press time.      Tesla CEO and amatuer crypto commentator Elon Musk once again was a catalyst for BTC’s market fall after he tweeted a perplexing meme suggesting some sort of breakup with the cryptocurrency.      “The market movement post-Musk's tweets continues to show how nascent this asset class is,” said Kevin Kang, co-founder of crypto hedge fund BKCoin Capital. “A lot of new retail investors tend to panic-sell post-Musk tweets.”      It’s hard to predict where the market will go into the weekend, according to Andrew Tu, an executive at quant trading fund Efficient Frontier.      “Hard to say where we go – fundamentally there are tons of funds and interest from traditional finance in crypto now,” Tu said. “At the same time a lot of this is still retail speculation, and there definitely is still a bubble that hasn't popped yet.”      Read More: Jack Dorsey Says Square Considering Developing a Bitcoin Hardware Wallet    Leverage plays role in bitcoin price plunge    As the price of BTC was falling the past 24 hours, leveraged traders going long were wiped out, causing the price dump to exacerbate.At 00:00 UTC(8:00 p.m. ET Thursday), as crypto started seeing heavy selling, leveraged bulls saw their positions liquidated, the blockchain equivalent of a margin call. This included over $66 million in liquidations from 04:00-07:59 UTC (12:00-3:59 a.m. ET), a week-high.      “We’ve seen today that investors are willing to leverage their positions,” said Elie Le Rest, partner at quant fund ExoAlpha.      BKCoin Capital’s Kang appears hopeful that as more big-time investors enter the space, a tweet from Musk might some day not mean a cascading crypto fall.      “As more institutional investors come into the space, we expect Musk's tweets to affect the market less and less, but we are far from that point at the moment,” said Kang.    Ether and bitcoin correlation holding    The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether, was trading around $2,684 as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET), slipping 3.8% over the prior 24 hours. The asset is above the 10-hour moving average but below the 50-hour a sideways signal for market technicians.      Ether fell from $2,866 at 01:45 UTC (7:45 p.m. ET Thursday) to $2,566 by 15:30 UTC (8:30 a.m. ET) Friday, a 10.4% slide based on CoinDesk 20 data. ETH has regained some of that, at $2,684 as of press time.      Over the past month, ether’s 90-day correlation with bitcoin has been above 0.70; the rate has held remarkably steady, hovering around that level and at 0.76 as of press time. A correlation coefficient of 1.0 means assets are working perfectly in tandem, while 0 means not at all.      It is common for cryptocurrencies to move in tandem during less-than-bullish conditions, noted Efficient Frontier’s Tu. “Most of crypto has become correlated,” he told CoinDesk.      ETH’s big differentiator – its role in decentralized finance (DeFi) – has deflated somewhat, said Jean-Marc Bonnefous, managing partner of investment fund Tellurian Capital.      “I guess we are now in a lower volatility phase after the doge-like buying frenzy and also after the recent wave of liquidations and margin calls on ERC-20 collateral last month,” Bonnefous said.    Ether gas prices rising again    After median gas prices on Ethereum dropped to a three-month low of 24 gwei May 30, the rate has been rebounding. According to data aggregator Dune Analytics, gas, which is required to conduct transactions, is now at a median of 29 gwei as of press time. Gwei is the smallest unit of account on Ethereum, worth 0.000000001 ETH.      “The cost of gas fluctuates with the supply and demand for processing power,” noted Constantin Kogan, a crypto investor and co-founder at BullPerks. “Right now, with a short dip, activity on the network declined hence the fees went down.”      Rich Rosenblum, co-founder of crypto market maker GSR, told CoinDesk the lack of market opportunities in DeFi is what’s causing network activity on Ethereum to fall.      “DeFi is less profitable when governance tokens aren’t rallying,” Rosenblum said.

42386972,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBW867,1622827398,Money Reimagined: The Power of Community,"As tens of thousands of crypto enthusiasts head to Florida for the Bitcoin Miami conference this weekend, an ebullient mood from the sun-drenched partygoers will permeate at least some of the commentary around Bitcoin. But the reality is that all is not perfect in cryptoland, at least in markets, which seem moribund – and irked by a guy named Elon.      While all that goes on, we at CoinDesk continue to process the impact of our action-packed Consensus 2021 conference last week. One part of that: figuring out how to keep engaging the incredible community that has formed around our $DESK rewards token, which is the subject of this week’s column. The creativity of this spontaneous group has gotten me thinking more broadly about the role that communities play in any system of money.      Speaking of communities, those of the decentralized finance ecosystem are innovating as frantically as ever. To talk about new developments in decentralized, layer 2 DeFi protocols and the challenge regulators face in figuring out how to address this complex new system, Sheila Warren and I were joined on our weekly “Money Reimagined” podcast by Rebecca Rettig, general counsel of Aave, and Marc Boiron, general counsel at decentralized exchange dYdX.      Have a listen after you read the newsletter.    You can't create money without Piranhas    At CoinDesk’s annual Consensus conference last week, we experimented with a new rewards token that was so well received it offered powerful insights into the relationship between community and money.      We gave ticket holders an initial issuance of 500 $DESK tokens and provided them with opportunities to earn more as they viewed sessions and participated in other features of the virtual event. Then we offered them a variety of non-fungible tokens (NFT), some redeemable for swag and experiences, others sold as rights to digital trading cards based on CoinDesk reports of famous moments in crypto history.    You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    The results way exceeded our expectations. By the end of the conference, there were 1,371 registered $DESK holders who among them had made more than 30,000 claims and purchased about 4,000 NFTs.      But more important than the raw numbers was the way in which people engaged with the concept. They stuck around and participated in the sessions, bantering with each other, both about $DESK and the live video content they were watching. In the process, they organically formed a lively $DESK community.      In a matter of days, the fledgling community had spun up its own Discord channel, while more than 500 signed up for a CoinDesk-administered $DESK Telegram channel. These “$DESK Piranhas” – as they call themselves – are building creative ideas around the token.      There are community-generated memes, including one with a mock movie trailer about plans for an NFT of the “black hoodie guy” seated behind FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried during one of his Consensus interviews. There are people planning $DESK meetups during this week’s Bitcoin Miami conference. And next week, there’s a shared Netflix Party viewing of the horror-comedy movie, ""Piranhas.""      All this has given us an opportunity to turn the $DESK experiment into a full CoinDesk product. For that, there are better minds than mine thinking of ways we incorporate $DESK into the wider website. (Watch this space.)      But in the meantime, we can look with wonder at how this community emerged and ponder what it says about all the other community phenomena around digital currencies, tokens, “meme investing” and money generally.    Money = Community    Our $DESK experience was a reminder that money has always been about community. There’s a feedback loop between people’s desire to own and use a currency and the way in which it intermediates human interaction. Regardless of how functionally advanced your currency is as a technology, this community function is a major determinant of its value.       Before I get into the obvious comparisons with the social media tribes that drive up the value of altcoins such as dogecoin and XRP, let’s recognize these ideas apply to government-issued fiat currencies, too.      The global system of exchange that has developed around the dollar is constantly being reinforced by people’s collective obsession with the U.S. currency. Think of all the movies, art, songs and cultural (meme) references to “greenbacks,” “Benjamin Franklins,” “bucks,” “fivers,” “pennies, nickels, dimes and quarters” that burnish its image as a quasi-magical object of desire.      This is where Joseph Nye’s concept of “soft power” intersects with currency. The international cultural community around the dollar is just one way the U.S. exerts power – its armed forces matter are another – but it’s a vital part of its global dominance.      Let’s face it, technologically, the dollar is outdated. The inefficient U.S. banking and payments system still uses paper checks, for crying out loud. It integrates none of the cutting-edge monetary policy and governance features that comes with cryptocurrencies and decentralized finance. Yet, it rules the world thanks largely to the self-reinforcing power of a “dollar community.”      Now, for the first time, that community is looking a little less united. As concerns rise about the political and economic sustainability of a dollar-centric global financial system, and as technologies spanning crypto, data services, trading and social media foster new approaches to payments and other financial services, people are exploring alternatives. It’s why everything around money suddenly seems unmoored, as a baffling array of new finance acronyms and memes leaves many in the mainstream confused: NFTs, SPACs, stonks, DeFi.      Among the many alternative projects, the winners will be those who find that same lightning-in-a-bottle formula that draws and builds a dedicated community of believers. You need to see something like CoinDesk’s little two-week-old $DESK experience sustained for a much longer period across a much larger group of people. l      It must be stressed that $DESK is merely a rewards token, not a currency. Although it’s an ERC-20 token – currently built on the Rinkeby Ethereum testnet – issuance and redemption is centrally determined and managed by CoinDesk. It can only be redeemed for CoinDesk products.      Even so, the lessons gleaned from this new community’s behavior are translatable to other, more truly decentralized cryptocurrencies.      Our experience speaks to why dogecoin gains so much attention, for example, despite its monetary inferiority to bitcoin and the comparatively small size of its developer base. A similarly fun, interactive concept of community has emerged among the world’s doge followers, albeit on a grander scale.      There’s also a lesson here for Bitcoin, as well as for Ethereum. The advanced technical aspects and large networks of these leading cryptocurrencies are vital to their long-term viability. But all that technical and developer firepower would be worth naught if there weren’t also two large, passionate communities of people obsessed with them.      Consider the giant Bitcoin Miami conference. Tens of thousands of people are descending on Miami this weekend because they want to be part of a vibrant community. (Also, read the “Conversation” below for a look at how emotional members of that community can get when their beliefs are challenged.)      This is the messy, human part of crypto. Memes, jokes, emotions and subjective, sometimes irrational beliefs seem antithetical to the serious, math-based work of protocol development. But in some respects, they are just as important for success, whether it’s hardcore bitcoiners’ aspirations for “digital gold” status, dogecoiners’ putting their Shiba Inu-themed coin’s sights on the “moon,” or a media outlet figuring out how best to employ its new corporate rewards token to optimize audience engagement.      Community matters.    Off the charts: BTC price and hashrate    With the price of bitcoin down almost 40% from its mid-April all-time high and with the bitcoin mining industry facing both environmental demands and the threat of a ban from China, it’s a good time to look at the relationship between the BTC price and the total Bitcoin hashrate.      First a six-month chart:      Based on a seven-day moving average, the Bitcoin network’s total hashing power has shrunk somewhat from a record high rate near 160 million terahashes per second in mid-May. More notable are the signs of a somewhat closer, but still imperfect correlation between price and hashrate during the two phases of market sell-off in April and May, as well as during the short-lived interim price rebound in late April/early May. The price pulled back harder than the hashrate during those sell-offs, while the latter rose further than the former during the rebound. Nonetheless, there’s some evidence here that the more bearish price environment is affecting miners’ resource decisions as the profitability equation shifts.      It’s too early to say whether the net decline in hashrate is a broad-based consolidation or a temporary blip to deal with margin squeezes for a small subset of miners. Perhaps it just reflects a small few who are now “re-decommissioning” the old, inefficient machines they’d previously recommissioned when margins were wide during the bull run.      To put what’s happening in perspective, let’s look at the long-term interaction between these two measures.      The chart shows that while a 10-year rise in price has been clearly accompanied by an expansion in hashrate as miners have consistently added more and faster capacity to tap dollar-based profits, short-term changes in hashrate have for the most part been independent of short-term price changes.      The hashrate began rising sharply from early 2019, even though it took more than another year before the bitcoin price properly emerged from its 2018 slump to start posting huge gains. And as the price kept rising, the hashrate had some big swings up and down even as the overall trend was skyward. That variability likely reflects non-price factors such as the weather-related ebb and flow of electricity generation from China’s hydro dams as well as the periodic introduction of new, more powerful chips and mining equipment at different times.      The one glaring exception to this independence was the price-correlated decline in mining capacity in late 2018 as a final leg down in BTC forced miners to shut down inefficient, expensive machines to protect margins. That capitulation seemed to confirm the reality of a longer-term slump in the overall crypto economy. The question is whether the latest signs of price-hashrate correlation foreshadow a similar movement into a bearish phase. If so, the good news for BTC hodlers is that same history suggests they really won’t have to wait long for both the price and the hashrate to resume their upward climb.    The conversation: Is bitcoin my true love or not?    This week’s journey into Crypto Twitter angst gets a more personal lens than usual.      Inviting trouble, perhaps, I’ve decided to analyze some of the negative responses to last week’s column, in which I wrote of the prospect of a new “crypto winter” due to a newly negative mainstream narrative around bitcoin’s environmental impact.      I argued that bitcoin miners and leaders should work proactively to shift perceptions, engaging with energy companies and government officials to develop policies that reduce bitcoin mining’s carbon footprint while turning it into a dynamic financing source for green energy infrastructure.      In doing so, I managed to upset bitcoiners and environmentalists alike. The response from the former was the most striking. It confirmed a point made in this week’s column that the bitcoin community is founded on emotional connections as much as rational thought.      Here’s my original post:      One classic anti-bitcoin take was inevitable – that it “wastes” energy:      Note: “Wastes energy” is an entirely subjective claim. It depends on whether you believe society gains something with censorship-resistant, decentralized money and whether you think bitcoin’s energy-consumptive, proof-of-work consensus algorithm is needed to achieve that. My answer: yes and yes. My only caveat is that we must strive for 100% renewable energy usage in that process.      From the bitcoin side, my critics were stirred up by podcaster and RT anchor Max Keiser:      This prompted a bunch of accusations that CoinDesk and I were spreading FUD (Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt).      Partly I think that’s because calling out a bear market tends to anger people whose fortunes are tied up in bitcoin. But more important, some hardcore believers treat any suggestion that bitcoin has a problem and, by extension, any suggestion on how to address that problem – even one as non-specific as mine, involving no inkling of a protocol change – as a de facto attack on its decentralized “perfection.”      My suggestion that miners work with government officials to promote green infrastructure may have challenged a purist view that the cryptocurrency will, on its own accord, change the world for the better just by existing. To me that’s a naive, blind-faith view that’s dangerously similar to the rigid beliefs of religious fanatics.      Either way, I’m still unclear how all this makes me a bitcoin “hater.” But that’s what one of my more frequent critics sought to prove in a series of tweets.      A couple of days later, triggered by a throwaway joke from Messari founder Ryan Selkis, my critic was back to repost a graphic that supposedly captures where Selkis and my ilk – including, intriguingly, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis analyst David Andolfatto – stand.      Note the crime we are accused of: We don’t truly love bitcoin. I feel like I missed a new commandment that our Lord Satoshi delivered to his disciples before departing: “Love Bitcoin as I have loved you.”       Seriously, do we need any more evidence that Bitcoin is founded as much on the quasi-religious adoration of believers as it is on cryptography? (Before you get upset, Dearest Don, this is not a bad thing. As stated above: community matters.)    Relevant reads: Rangebound    After a big sell-off in the third week of May followed by a modest but insufficient rebound last week, bitcoin has yet to decide where it wants to go. It was rangebound, proving incapable of bursting through the $40,000 barrier, still well below its April high above $64,000. (Also, as we were going to print, the market was dealing with yet another round of Elon Musk-led selling pressure.) Where do we go from here?    This Market Wrap from Daniel Cawrey lays out nicely why resistance is proving so tough, in part because of all the leverage that was taken out of the market with the sell-off. Data on perpetual swaps, which give liquidity to leveraged traders, suggests that no one’s taking out loans to fund bets, which inevitably slows the market down. One positive note: The concurrent softening in ether’s price has reduced its gas fees, whose high levels were making the network prohibitively expensive for smaller users.  Peering at all this from the non-crypto world, MRB Partners, a boutique investment firm, made the declaration that bitcoin’s bull market “may have come to an end.” As Damanick Dantes reports, the group’s research report points to a confluence of factors putting an end to the easy money that previously fueled the crypto bubble: “cryptocurrencies’ environmental impact, possible regulatory risks, negative technical trends and a future reduction in monetary stimulus.”  Appearing on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover,” Raghu Yarlagadda of FalconX, a trading platform, was asked about whether the $40,000 barrier could be broken, and offered a somewhat more optimistic take: that although Asian retail investors were big sellers driving the recent price collapse, institutional investors in the U.S. appeared to be either holding firm or cautiously adding to positions. However, without as much leverage in the market, big price moves are not likely, he confirmed.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Michael J.

42386958,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBW7sH,1622824064,"BlockFi's Botched Promo Payouts Continued Into April, Adding More Confusion for Users","Last month, 34-year-old Laguna Beach resident Benjamin Levine logged into his BlockFi account and noticed a sudden windfall of 329 BTC, worth over $16 million dollars at the time.      “Obviously, I was pretty wide eyed when I saw that,” said Levine.      He and his wife were driving, and he pulled over to the side of the road. “It said that I received a bonus payment for April as part of a promotional payment,” said Levine. “And it's 329 bitcoin. I remember saying to her, ‘Dang! I just won a promotion!’”      Despite the extreme amount, Levine didn’t question his good fortune. The deposit was clearly labeled as a promotion, something he had checked multiple times.      Levine’s bitcoin payment was, in fact, a costly mistake by the crypto lending company BlockFi, which is still trying to recover bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies it incorrectly deposited to users’ accounts as part of a botched round of promotional payments.      The promotion was intended to incentivize users to trade in large volumes by rewarding them with the stablecoin Gemini dollar (GUSD). In some instances, however, the payouts were awarded in BTC, sometimes millions of dollars worth. This mix-up seems to have been an underlying factor in some, though not all, of the erroneous deposits.    Read more: BlockFi Botches Promo With Outsized Bitcoin Reward Payments    The drama that ensued illustrates a tension with centralized platforms. One of the key innovations behind bitcoin is that transactions are not supposed to be reversible. But centralized platforms like BlockFi seem pretty willing to try.      CoinDesk spoke with three different users who, among the dozens who have since surfaced on social media and discussion boards, were mistakenly given BTC rewards. They were able to successfully move some of the bitcoin off the BlockFi platform but expressed confusion and frustration at the lack of communication from BlockFi until days after the deposits, and uncertainty about what might happen next. In all three cases, BlockFi tried to recover the money after it was sent.    Fallout from the BlockFi promo error    On May 14, BlockFi tweeted a brief statement stating there were issues with a March trading promotion, and some participants might be awarded incorrect bonuses.      After CoinDesk reported on May 18 that users were able to move some of those BTC awards off the platform, and therefore beyond BlockFi’s control, BlockFi issued a statement on May 19 expanding on the issue. It confirmed CoinDesk’s reporting, tweeting that “a small edge case of approximately 100 clients were (sic) able to access the erroneous deposits and withdraw funds from the platform on May 17.”      Speaking at Consensus, BlockFi CEO Zac Prince downplayed the issue.      “I don't think it's too big of a topic,” he said. “We processed the promo payout and there was a bug and an error made where we processed it in bitcoin instead of in dollars. I think things got a bit confused online because there were some users who, for an hour, had 700 bitcoin show up in their BlockFi account. That was very quickly changed and corrected.”      Prince added that a derivative of that bug allowed users to withdraw some of that BTC.      “The net impact to BlockFi’s was sub-100 clients that actually were impacted by this and less than $10 million USD in total value,” he said.      When CoinDesk emailed Prince to discuss the error in more detail, including how it could have happened, he responded with a link to BlockFi’s tweeted statement.      The statements by BlockFi show that it was not just its March promotion participants that were affected, but a variety of promotions. Levine, for example, said he received a BTC deposit on Friday, May 14, worth around $16 million at the time, labeled as an April promotion. CoinDesk reviewed documentation of the deposit.      Multiple users were able to move bitcoin off the platform, with some amounts worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. BlockFi, meanwhile, has called users who attempted to withdraw funds from the platform and sent legal threats.    Unintended consequences    Levine said he tried to offload the BTC that same Friday in order to use it to purchase a stake in a company he’d been contemplating a deal with for months. He wanted to move quickly as crypto was experiencing a period of volatility in which his bitcoin bounty was declining in value.      After initiating multiple transactions, he was able to move 4 BTC off the platform, before BlockFi reversed the large deposit on Monday. Levine said he did not hear anything from BlockFi while he was sorting out details of the deal until Sunday, by which point he had signed a contract.      Now, after repeated conversations with BlockFi, including a phone call in which Levine alleges BlockFi co-founder Flori Marquez threatened to get the FBI involved, Levine is in a tough position. He’s responsible for the business deal he entered into because he took BlockFi’s initial deposit at face value. He could even face millions of dollars in potential liability.      When CoinDesk emailed Prince to ask about Marquez's allegations, he responded with a link to BlockFi’s tweeted statement.    Conflicting timestamps    Another user who spoke with CoinDesk said they were in shock when they got their March promotional payout, and thought they had won something. The user (who asked for anonymity for fear of reprisal) said that “as any good crypto enthusiast would, I transferred the funds immediately to my cold storage wallet.”      CoinDesk reviewed screenshots of these transactions.      About 90 minutes later the user noticed BlockFi initiated a transaction reversal, so the user assumed there was no way the withdrawal would still go through, given how long withdrawals from BlockFi generally take. At this point, there had still been no communication from BlockFi about any errors.      Then, soon after that transaction reversal appeared on the site, the user noticed the timestamp had been changed. It now appeared as if the reversal had been issued at the same time as it landed in the user's account, not 90 minutes after the fact.      The user alleges the timestamp was changed to make it appear as if the reversal had been issued at the same time as it landed in the user's account, not 90 minutes later.      The user put in a withdrawal cancellation request, but even so the withdrawal went through and the requested BTC showed up in his cold storage.      Then came the carrot-and-stick emails, threatening legal action while also offering compensation in GUSD to return the funds.

After receiving his deposit on Friday, May 14, he initiated about eight different transfers. After receiving the initial email from BlockFi threatening legal action on Sunday he went back to look at his transaction history.      “They had gone to the transaction history and inserted a transaction reversal of negative 329 BTC directly above where the deposit had originally shown up,” said Levine. “So it's very suspicious that could, number one, represent it as being the same exact time in the day and on the same date, but they also superseded any of the following transfers in chronological order.”      When we asked Prince to discuss these alleged timestamp alterations by email, he responded again with a link to BlockFi’s tweeted statement.    More oversight required?    Joseph Kelly, CEO of Unchained Capital, another crypto financial services company, said it’s rare for companies like BlockFi to see the kind of growth they have in the last few years without making some mistakes. From a company building perspective, he said, it makes sense that maybe an error like this would happen. Nor are these kinds of issues uncommon in the traditional financial world. In 2020, Citibank accidentally sent a hedge fund $175 million and struggled to retrieve the money.      Levine is exploring his legal options. Ultimately, he thinks centralized entities like BlockFi must have more oversight.      “I am not in crypto to be a part of a centralized system and this situation made that clear to me,” said the anonymous user, echoing Levine’s perspective. “The fact I was able to withdraw this incorrect bonus is really concerning.”      “They need to have guidelines or more monitoring. At least once that exists, and if a situation like this happens, there's guidelines on how to deal with it,” said Levine. “From my perspective, it felt like rather than confront their error, they were trying to cover their tracks and threaten me. It just seemed wrong.”",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | REGULATION | TRADING,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/06/04/blockfis-botched-promo-payouts-continued-into-april-adding-more-confusion-for-users,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4b8219145d28cb34452670147a0c24df9a3d70dd-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

He added that bitcoin is for everyone, and it's important for his team to build an inclusive product that brings a non-custodial solution to the global market.  Dorsey said there are plans to integrate the wallet with Square's Cash App.  “Cash App integration is obvious for us but only part of the solution. A smooth experience likely depends on a custom-built app but it doesn’t need to be owned by Square. We can imagine apps that work without Square and maybe also without permission from Apple and Google. You?” said Dorsey.  Dorsey, who is Square's CEO, said he is open to feedback and will continue the conversation around developing a hardware wallet.

On Thursday, the U.K. financial watchdog said it is concerned that a ""significantly high number"" of crypto-asset businesses are not meeting its standards on AML, which in turn has seen an “unprecedented number of businesses withdrawing their applications.""  The FCA has extended the deadline for crypto businesses to register under its Temporary Registrations Regime (TRR) from July 9 to March 31 of next year.  The TRR was established in December 2020 to allow businesses that had registered to continue trading after the regulator became the AML and counter-terrorist financing supervisor for crypto firms.  It is estimated only five crypto-asset firms have been admitted to the FCA’s formal register and 90 firms are currently being assessed through the regulator's TRR scheme, reports the Guardian.  While 51 crypto asset firms so far have withdrawn their applications, not all may be covered by FCA requirements, meaning not all of them may be forced to shut down, according to the publication.  Those covered crypto-asset firms that refuse to shut down could face fines or legal action by the FCA.

42386945,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBW3Lj,1622804448,Open Positions in CME-Based Bitcoin Futures Slump to 5 1/2-Month Low,"The total amount of funds allocated in ""standard"" bitcoin futures contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) slid to an almost six-month low Wednesday, indicating a decline in institutional activity.      The dollar value of open interest – futures contracts traded but not liquidated with an offsetting position – dropped to $1.36 billion, the least since Dec. 16, data from Skew shows. The level has more than halved since mid-April, when the U.S-based Coinbase exchange debuted on Nasdaq.      The number of open contracts also fell, sliding more than 22% in recent weeks to 36,265, according to data provided by Glassnode. These regulated standard futures contracts trade in 5 BTC denominations, require a large capital outlay and are considered synonymous with institutional participation.      ""The CME was the favorite liquidity avenue for institutions to hedge their GBTC [Grayscale bitcoin trust] exposure,"" Crypto finance firm Amber Group told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat. ""However, ever since the GBTC premium eroded, there's been a lesser impetus for these sort of flows.""      The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), from the crypto-asset manager Grayscale, is the largest U.S. investment vehicle for buying bitcoin (BTC) through a stock exchange. Accredited investors can buy shares of the trust at the net asset value, but aren't allowed to sell them on the secondary market for six months. New York-based Grayscale is owned by Digital Currency Group, the parent company of CoinDesk.      Until February, GBTC shares traded at premiums as high as 40% to the price of bitcoin, attracting institutional investors who intended to redeem them at a premium six months later. They hedged the exposure with a short futures position on the CME. That pushed up the open interest on the CME, making it the biggest futures platform at the end of December.      ""Institutions were hedging the outright delta [long GBTC exposure] and capturing the subscription premium,"" Amber Group said.      The trade lost its shine after the premium turned into a discount in February. The situation has persisted ever since, causing a decline in open interest on the CME.      In addition, the price crash in May crowded out excess bullish leverage from the market, leading to a drop in open interest on the CME and other major exchanges.      The amount deployed in futures contracts across the globe is about $11.9 billion, down from $19 billion a month ago. Bitcoin tanked 35% in May on concerns regarding the negative environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining and a regulatory crackdown in China.      Futures contracts on non-regulated exchanges like Binance and Deribit trade in denominations of 1 BTC, one-fifth the size of the CME's, and are taken to represent retail activity. The CME launched micro bitcoin futures last month. A micro bitcoin is equivalent to 1/10th of one bitcoin.      The CME and other exchanges could continue to see low activity for some time, as the futures premium has declined with the recent price sell-off, making carry trades unattractive.      Cash and carry arbitrage, a market-neutral strategy, involves buying an asset in the spot market against a short position in the futures market when the futures draw a significant premium relative to the spot price. That alllows traders to make a fixed return as the futures premium decays over time and converges with the spot price on the expiry date.      Carry trades now offer significantly less yield than they did at the height of the bull market. Skew data show the CME currently offers an annualized rolling three-month basis (futures premium) of 3%, compared with 12% in mid-April. Other exchanges have seen a similar drop, with Binance futures drawing a premium of 8% against 42% in April.      Also read: Bitcoin’s Bull Market ‘May Have Come to an End,’ Says MRB Partners      ""The recent crash has depressed yields across the ecosystem,"" Rahul Rai managing partner at Gamma Point Capital, said.

The cryptocurrency was priced near $36,800 at press time – down 6% on the day. The 20-day SMA was seen at $38,400.  The four-hour chart shows the cryptocurrency has dived below the uptrend line rising from lows near $33,000, while the relative strength index (RSI) has dipped into a bearish territory below 50.  That shows scope for a deeper decline, which will likely materialize if the U.S. nonfarm payrolls figure due at 12:30 UTC blows past expectations. A substantially higher than expected number could boost the probability of an early scaling back of stimulus by the Federal Reserve.  The data is expected to show the economy added 664,000 jobs in May, far above 266,000 initially reported for April, according to FXStreet.  Likewise, bitcoin may see a recovery if the figure disappoints by a wide margin. That said, the outlook will remain bearish while prices are held under the 200-day SMA at $41,576.

The West African country boasts one of the first central banks on the continent to say it was working on a digital currency, looking at the concept of an e-cedi, Addison said.      “We are quite advanced in that process,"" Addison said. ""With these types of things, you have to go at it in phases and the first phase was really on the design of the electronic money and the team that has gone quite far in the design phase, they are looking at the implementation phase.""      The next will be a pilot “where a few people would be able to use the digital cedi on the mobile applications.” After that the bank will decide whether the incipient central bank digital currency (CBDC) is feasible and what needs to be tweaked, Addison told reporters.      In February, Ghana’s central bank partnered with Emtech, a digital transformation consortium, to launch a sandbox focused on areas like blockchain, CBDCs and financial inclusion.    See also: Ghana to Prioritize Blockchain Projects in New Regulatory Sandbox    During his speech, Addison warned against “unregulated” cryptocurrencies.      “I think there is a lot more emphasis on looking at digital money which is backed by the state, backed by the central banks.

Musk tweeted a broken heart with the bitcoin logo and a picture showing a couple in the midst of a breakup during the Asian hours.  The crypto community took it as a sign of the billionaire distancing himself from bitcoin, leading to price losses.  Bitcoin fell nearly 7%, hitting lows under $36,500 and reversing Thursday's rally to $39,200. Other cryptocurrencies including ether, cardano, polkadot and dogecoin followed suit, suffering relatively bigger losses.  The pullback poured cold water over the optimism generated by the symmetrical-triangle breakout confirmed on Thursday.  ""The failed breakout is not a good sign,"" Delta Exchange CEO Pankaj Balani said. ""We could see deeper losses if the recent range is breached to the downside.""  Bitcoin is currently down more than 40% from the record-high $64,801 reached on April 14.  The cryptocurrency fell by 35% last month after Tesla delisted bitcoin as means of payment, citing environmental concerns. The move quashed hopes for widespread corporate adoption.  Musk's latest tweet may further amplify those fears.  Data provided by Skew shows the options market is biased bearish, with long put trades accounting for 29% of the flows seen today and short call trades accounting for 30%.

According to a press release on Wednesday, Norton's feature, dubbed Norton Crypto, has begun allowing select Norton 360 customers of its early adopter program to begin mining ether.      Adopters can join a Norton mining pool where they can use the feature on a personal computer to apply its computation power for low-volume crypto mining, a company spokesperson told CoinDesk via email.      The mining pool will pay out miners periodically based on the timing of their participation and the number of shares they are credited via their contribution. Payouts will be allocated to either a Norton Crypto Wallet, generated by the company or a personal one designated by the miner.      Software built into the Norton 360 platform will run when a computer is idle. Once ether has been mined, it can be stored in Norton's wallet via the cloud. Mined coins can also be tracked and extracted to crypto exchange Coinbase.      Miners must pay a 15% fee of the total crypto sent to their wallets for use of Norton's service, according to the company's terms and conditions. Miners should also account for electricity costs, degradation of computer parts and fluctuating crypto prices.
