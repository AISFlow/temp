According to Yomi, DOGE is on the verge of creating a golden cross on its price chart, an event that could indicate the continuation of a major bull run. He noted the need for a green candle this week in order to start a new rally, which could be tough considering recent on-chain metrics and market fundamentals. Dogecoin Flashing Weekly Golden Cross The weekly chart for Dogecoin is flashing a golden cross, a bullish signal that occurs when the 50-week moving average crosses above the 200-week moving average. According to a weekly price chart shared by Yomi, this weekly cross looked almost completed just two weeks ago, as a price surge for DOGE in the past two months saw the short-term moving average approaching the longer one. Related Reading: Will The Halving Send Bitcoin Price To $100,000? Analytics Platform Reveals What You Should Expect However, trader sentiment around DOGE has turned bearish since the beginning of April as the bulls struggled to push the crypto past the $0.22 mark, allowing it to form a price resistance level. Consequently, DOGE has gone on to form two weeks of bearish candles, which has derailed the completion of a golden cross. Update on #Dogecoin pending weekly Golden Cross. We are still multiple weeks of upward price action away from achieving this bull market milestone. 2 red weeks in a row have cause us to deviate slightly also. Need green soon to get back on track! #DOGE #Altcoins pic.twitter.com/QfdFSR24Uc — Yomi (@OG_Yomi) April 15, 2024 Yomi observed that the formation of this bullish indicator has been pushed forward to multiple weeks of upward price movement. Furthermore, Yomi said all that’s needed is for DOGE to close higher than its open price this week and form a green candle to confirm the breakout and get back on track to a golden cross. DOGE To Turn Bullish? Dogecoin dropped by an astounding margin last week to spearhead the crash in the majority of meme coins. Interestingly, the crypto fell to as low as $0.13 in the middle of the week, representing a 33% decline from its opening price at the start of the week. During the price fall, crypto whale transaction tracker Whale Alerts noted the transfer of 600 million DOGE tokens worth $92.3 million from a private wallet into Binance, hinting at a potential sell-off from a DOGE whale. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETF Issuers Push Holdings To 4.27% Of BTC Supply Amid Crash To $61,000 However, all is not lost as Dogecoin price action has been showing green in the past day. At the time of writing, DOGE is trading at $0.1669, up by 5% in the past 24 hours. If DOGE can close substantially above its weekly open of $0.1624, that would confirm the continuation of the journey to a golden cross and likely kick off a new uptrend. Yomi noted in another post on social media that Doge will continue to tease a bullish price action in the longer term as long as it stays above $0.12 this week.

The crypto analyst shared her insights after analyzing the recent market decline and the impending Bitcoin halving this month. According to the expert, there have been speculations that since BTC broke its all-time high early, the cryptocurrency can continue seeing fresh gains. Bullish Run Misconception: Bitcoin Can Hit Another ATH? Lady of Crypto has disregarded the claims that this bull cycle will begin early, saying she believed the community was “lied to and suggesting widespread misinformation” and dismissing the current gains as the signs of a widespread bull run. Related Reading: Will The Halving Send Bitcoin Price To $100,000? Analytics Platform Reveals What You Should Expect As The Halving approaches, the analyst noted that Bitcoin and Altcoins are severely down, but this is not the time to panic. Drawing attention to the 2016 and 2020 pre-halving dips, she highlights that BTC plummeted by 30% and 20% shortly before the event. Meanwhile, during this pre-halving period, BTC has dropped by over 17%, with altcoins falling by 29%. Although the current decline was severe, Lady of Crypto notes that it is in the range of a typical pre-halving dip and a black swan event. She compares the COVID meltdown, in which BTC fell by 58% and altcoins by 68%, suggesting that the current decline pales in significance. Lady of Crypto clarified that Bitcoin Spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) have been a major factor in BTC breaking its peak early, highlighting that the masses have not yet arrived. The expert then points to social media presence, revealing that the masses are returning to the crypto market. “YouTube views and subscribers show interest in returning gradually, in line with this time last cycle, as do new Twitter followers,” she added. This Bull Cycle Is Mirroring Past Halving Except for BTC’s early all-time high break, Lady of Crypto believes this bull run is unfolding similarly to the last two, albeit with more volatility. However, the volatility suggests this will be the biggest bull market ever. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bonanza Before The Halving? Analyst Sees Pre-Crash Buying Window She advises underexposed investors that the dips are the best chance to purchase BTC during a bull run. Meanwhile, if an investor is overexposed, holding the crypto asset has historically been the best course of action, drawing attention to 2020 and 2021 dips. Addressing fear and panic among investors, Lady of Crypto cautioned that multiple situations might trigger a panic sell during every bull run. Even though these events appear terrible, like the bull run coming to an end, they are just sideshows.

This was supported by positive developments in the Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) markets, which came alongside the approval of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for both cryptocurrencies in Hong Kong. Additionally, Solana addressed its ongoing network congestion issues with a new update, aiming to rectify transaction failures and outages. New Update Tackling Implementation Bug According to Mert Mumtaz, CEO of Helius Labs, Solana’s recent network congestion issues were attributed to an implementation bug rather than a fundamental design flaw. Mumtaz clarified that Solana’s current predicament results from a flaw in implementing a specific protocol. According to Anza, a spin-off of Solana Labs, Solana has released a new update to its validator client software to combat this. The update, v1.17.31, aims to reduce network congestion and will be followed by further improvements in v1.18. Anza emphasized the update’s significance, urging MainnetBeta validators to adopt it. The enhancements introduced in the update are expected to mitigate Solana’s ongoing network congestion issues. Related Reading: Bitcoin Goes Pro: UFC Winner Wants $300,000 Bonus Paid In BTC Furthermore, validators were advised to upgrade their systems when there is less than 5% delinquent stake, ensuring they have sufficient time to monitor the node after the upgrade. Any issues encountered during the upgrade were to be reported to ⁠mb-validators. Solana Status, a trusted source, corroborated the announcement, recommending the v1.17.31 release for general use. Trent.sol, Solana’s developer and operations manager, emphasized that the effectiveness of the update would be proportional to its adoption across the network. While the improvements primarily target Solana’s Stake Weighted Quality of Service (SWQOS) and may not result in significant changes to the reliability of unstacked Tensor processing units (TPU) traffic, Solana users were advised to keep delinquency below 5% during the upgrade process. Furthermore, Anza hinted at additional enhancements in the pipeline, urging users to stay tuned for further updates. Solana Price Rebounds With 7% Surge After unveiling updates to enhance network efficiency, the Solana price has surged by over 7%. This surge has helped offset the ongoing downtrend experienced by Solana, which amounted to nearly 21% over the past month. In addition, the Hong Kong SFC has officially approved several spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, including asset managers such as China Asset Management, Bosera Capital, HashKey Capital Limited, and an in-principle approval for Harvest Global Investments. This regulatory approval has not only positively impacted the prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum but has also instilled a sense of positivity in the overall cryptocurrency market. As a result, the top 10 cryptocurrencies have witnessed significant uptrends, riding on the wave of these developments. Related Reading: Toncoin Defies Market Turmoil, Surges 25% To Tally All-Time High – Details Despite the recent surge in Solana’s price, SOL’s trading volume has decreased by -44.70% in the last 24 hours, indicating a recent decline in market activity, according to CoinGecko data. Solana’s current trading price of $151.40 presents the first obstacle in the cryptocurrency’s path toward further price gains. If this hurdle is surpassed, the next significant resistance lies at $170, which would signify a recovery of SOL’s gains recorded over the past month. On the other hand, the $130 mark has proven to be a strong support level for Solana, representing the foundation of SOL’s one-month bullish structure, which propelled its price rally to nearly three-year highs of $210 on March 18.

25806979,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=603298,1713211240,Bitcoin Miners To Lose A Whopping $10 Billion Following The Halving – Here’s Why,"The Bitcoin Halving is set to take place this week. Miners’ rewards will be cut in half from 6.25 BTC to 3.125. This event is expected to have far-reaching effects on the miners themselves, as they are bound to lose a significant amount of revenue once the halving occurs. Bitcoin Miners Could Lose Up To $10 Billion In Revenue According to a Bloomberg report, Bitcoin miners could lose up to $10 billion annually following the Bitcoin Halving. This is because these miners, who currently earn 900 BTC daily from validating transactions, would see their income drop to 450 BTC once the halving happens. However, it is worth noting that this projected revenue loss is based on Bitcoin’s current price. Related Reading: Ethereum Whales Go On Buying Spree As Market Crash Leaves Retail Panicking Therefore, this revenue loss can be cushioned if Bitcoin’s price experiences a significant surge after the halving. These miners will, however, have in mind that reliance on Bitcoin’s price rise isn’t sustainable, considering that they will also encounter subsequent bear markets, which would lead to a price decline for the flagship crypto. That is why miners like Marathon Digital and CleanSpark are reported to have invested in new equipment and have sought to weed out the competition by buying out their smaller rivals. Buying out the competition can reduce the number of miners competing for block rewards and cushion the drop in their daily revenue. Bitcoinist also previously reported that Bitcoin miners were looking to diversify their operations in a bid to boost their revenue streams and earn additional income that could cushion the effects of the halving. The artificial intelligence (AI) sector is one of those areas in which these miners are actively seeking opportunities, considering that Bitcoin mining’s infrastructure is well suited for certain AI operations. BTC Miners Facing Competition From Tech Giants Bloomberg also reported that US Bitcoin miners are facing competition from the largest tech companies in the world for electricity to power their operations. These tech giants, who also happen to be high-energy consumers, are looking for as much energy as Bitcoin miners to power their data centers. Related Reading: Market Expert Reveals Why Solana Price Is Poised To Go Higher The report further noted that electricity constraints in the US, alongside the high demand for electricity among miners and tech giants, have led to a surge in electricity rates. This development is also making it harder for Bitcoin miners to run their operations smoothly in the country. Tech companies are said to have an edge over them when acquiring power from utility companies due to their consistent revenue streams, unlike Bitcoin miners, whose success largely depends on Bitcon’s volatile price.

42391004,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdRxDp,1713210045,"There Are Many Bitcoin Critics Left in Finance, Despite BlackRock's Newfound Love","Many mid-sized asset managers in traditional finance are still skeptical about bitcoin, even after some of the biggest names in the industry have started to endorse the cryptocurrency.  Some call bitcoin a ""bubble"" while others don't see demand from clients and therefore, have no reason to participate in the alternative asset class.  Around the time it turned 15 and following years of scoffing by others on Wall Street, Bitcoin in 2023 won acceptance from one of the most powerful investors in the world, BlackRock. Other traditional finance firms had endorsed the original cryptocurrency, to be sure, but BlackRock's blessing – in the form of filing to create a spot bitcoin ETF and vocal praise from CEO Larry Fink – was widely viewed as a surprising and significant turn of events.  The tone around bitcoin {{BTC}} seemed to shift among finance professionals – at least some of them – in the aftermath, with more players voicing support.  And, yet, earlier this month at an event in Miami for investment pros, it was clear that a significant swath of the industry continues to have serious doubts about bitcoin.  ""Bitcoin is just an extractive bubble,"" Mike Green, portfolio manager at Simplify Asset Management, said at the recent Miami Investment Masters Symposium. ""It's effectively a mechanism to transfer wealth from one group of individuals to another.""  That skepticism doesn't translate into Simplify completely ignoring bitcoin, however. It offers customers two funds that are exposed to BTC: the Simplify Bitcoin Strategy PLUS Income ETF and the Simplify US Equity PLUS GBTC ETF, which invests 10% of its assets in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).  There is demand for bitcoin, so Simplify is meeting that desire, Green said. But this doesn't change his overall view that bitcoin is simply a mechanism to transfer wealth. ""No value has been created and nothing has been done per se.""  Bitcoin skepticism remains common  There are signs of broader reluctance. For spot bitcoin ETFs, even though they have seen unprecedented demand for a newly released product, they are not being offered to clients of some wealth management firms, including Vanguard and State Street. Only about half a dozen prominent firms have disclosed that they let their customers invest in the funds and experts believe that most of the volume for the bitcoin ETFs comes from retail investors.  Banking giant Goldman Sachs, though it plays a key role for BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) as a so-called authorized participant, earlier this month reiterated that it doesn’t believe bitcoin belongs in investment portfolios and that its clients are not interested in the cryptocurrency.  Stone X Group's chief strategist, Kathryn Vera, gave a presentation at the Miami conference, stating that bitcoin won't be a reserve currency – economics jargon for a currency like the dollar, euro or yuan held by central banks to support global trade and finance – ""in her lifetime."" A key reason why the largest conventional currencies are cornerstones of finance is this reserve currency status.  Gold fan and economist Peter Schiff called bitcoin gambling money that has no use in the present or the future. ""This whole thing is a big bubble,"" he said at the event, as bitcoin was trading around a new record high above $73,000. ""It's going to collapse.""  While some asset managers have picked their side and stand firm on their opinions, others simply aren't at the point yet where they are forced to consider the asset class as an investment – despite the recent creation in the U.S. of 11 bitcoin ETFs from BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale and others designed to make it easier for investors to buy bitcoin.  Green said his firm isn't seeing much interest in bitcoin from its clients – though he concedes that might partly be the firm's fault as it doesn’t actively market the cryptocurrency or advise clients to invest in it.  Another asset manager, who asked not to be named, said that the firm is making its clients so much money that it simply doesn't need bitcoin, especially because the crypto asset requires a level of forecasting that all of the other trades that the firm makes don't. ""Business is booming with the focus we have,"" the manager said.  According to Green, a lot of his peers aren't willing to put in the work to really understand the technologies behind bitcoin and other crypto assets, especially when there is no pressure from clients to do so and because speaking negatively about the cryptocurrency or expressing skepticism or speculation in the space doesn't seem to have any negative impact, he said.  As a result, there is a tremendous amount of disinformation circulating in the industry.  ""There is a lack of interest in really understanding it because it's really hard to pursue something like bitcoin whole-cloth,"" he said.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/04/15/there-are-many-bitcoin-critics-left-in-finance-despite-blackrocks-newfound-love,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0c32261031829c7c7fd2af250ec4d70c158be50e-1078x607.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42391000,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdRx8h,1713209638,Elizabeth Warren Demands U.S. CFTC Chair Explain His Chats With SBF,"The head of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), Rostin Behnam, had a lot of contact with Sam Bankman-Friend, the disgraced former CEO of FTX, but lawmakers suggest he hasn't been fully forthcoming about those interactions. So, Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) are demanding more.  Warren and Grassley sent Behnam a letter calling for ""an accounting of all meetings and correspondence between you and Sam Bankman-Fried during your tenure."" Over a 14-month period, CFTC officials had met with Bankman-Fried and his team as many as 10 times at the agency, and Behnam told lawmakers in 2022 that he'd also exchanged ""a number of messages"" with the FTX founder, who was recently sentenced to 25 years in prison for the massive fraud perpetrated there.  For his part, Behnam and his agency have at least one significant reason for communicating so often with the FTX CEO: He was trying to push a part of his company – the LedgerX division that was spun off again after the collapse to return to its original name – into a unique position to directly handle margined derivatives trading for customers without a go-between firm. The failed effort had even been the topic of an in-house roundtable discussion at the CFTC in which SBF starred on a big panel otherwise filled with industry opponents.  In a Senate hearing in 2022 just after the meltdown of FTX, Grassley and another senator asked Behnam for information on his and his staff's meetings and text conversations with Bankman-Fried. Afterwards, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) asked for records of correspondence between FTX, the CFTC, other government agencies and the White House.  The new letter from Warren and Grassley, dated April 12, again asks for such correspondence, detailing that they want copies of all written communications, plus minutes and timelines of interactions.  ""We just received these letters, so we will work with the office to get them the information they need,"" said Steven Adamske, a spokesman for the CFTC.  The chief of the other U.S. markets regulator, Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, has similarly drawn scrutiny for his agency's interactions with SBF in the months before the company's dramatic collapse.

Bitcoin accounted for nearly 55% of the $2.4 trillion digital asset market at the end of last week, a level not seen since April 2021. On Saturday, in particular, BTC’s dominance jumped to 57% as it briefly touched the $67,000 mark. The next largest tokens by market share include Ethereum (ETH), Tether’s USDT stablecoin, Binance exchange’s native token Binance Coin (BNB), and Solana (SOL). BTC’s Rise Fueled By Successful US Bitcoin ETF Launches According to Bloomberg, the recent success of the recently approved US spot Bitcoin ETFs from prominent issuers such as BlackRock and Fidelity Investments has played a significant role in Bitcoin’s rise. These ETFs have garnered approximately $56 billion in assets, making their debut one of the most successful in fund category history. Related Reading: XRP Poised For Takeoff: Analysts Predict Huge Gains After Bitcoin Halving The inflows into these ETFs drove BTC to its current all-time high (ATH) of $73,798 in mid-March, a clear resistance level for the largest cryptocurrency on the market, as evidenced by its inability to consolidate above the $70,000 level following this achievement. Although BTC is down about 6% since then, smaller digital assets such as Avalanche (AVAX), Polkadot (DOT), and Chainlink (LINK) have seen more significant declines of nearly 30% over the past month. This drop coincided with reduced expectations for looser US monetary policy settings, often fueling speculative gains. Hong Kong-Listed ETFs Boosts Bitcoin And Ethereum Institutional investors’ allocations to the US Bitcoin ETF have greatly influenced Bitcoin’s performance relative to the rest of the market. Benjamin Celermajer, director of digital-asset investment at Magnet Capital, noted that strong institutional demand is a key driver. On Monday, Bitcoin and Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, saw notable price jumps following indications that asset managers are preparing to launch Hong Kong-listed ETFs on both tokens. Bitcoin rose 4.3% to $66,575, while ETH jumped 6.2% to $3,260. These rallies had a positive impact on the broader crypto market, lifting other notable tokens such as Polygon (MATIC), Cardano (ADA), the dog-themed meme coin Dogecoin (DOGE), and Solana, which is now the top 5 cryptocurrency market winner, up over 8% on Monday. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Insider Reveals Top 5 Shibarium Investment Rules Interestingly, the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index, which measures the performance of the largest digital assets traded in US dollars, has more than tripled since the beginning of last year, marking a significant rebound from the bear market experienced in 2022. Lastly, investors and traders eagerly anticipate the upcoming Bitcoin Halving, an event that will cut the new supply of the token in half, expected around April 20th. Previous Halving events have acted as a tailwind for prices, although there are growing doubts about whether history will repeat itself given BTC’s recent all-time high achievement. BTC has successfully maintained its position above the $66,000 threshold and has consolidated in this range. However, it is important to note that losses have accumulated over longer time frames. Over the past fourteen and thirty days of trading, the cryptocurrency has experienced significant declines of over 21% and 24% respectively.

42391007,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdRxTD,1713203949,Hong Kong Boards the ETF Express,"Hong Kong regulators on Monday approved the launch of spot bitcoin and ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs), according to local reports. It’s the latest signal of the increasing institutionalization of the world’s leading crypto assets, and perhaps a harbinger of things to come in mainland China, which banned virtually all crypto activity in 2021.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.     ChinaAMC, Harvest Global and Bosera International are among the asset managers granted licenses to launch these spot market products by the Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), though more may follow. In recent months, Hong Kong regulators have signaled their intent to open the former citystate into a crypto hub.  Notably, Hong Kong is positioning itself as one of the first regions to approve spot ether ETFs. Canada, the first country to allow the launch of bitcoin ETFs, approved ETH ETFs a few months later. In the U.S., where the Securities and Exchange Commission’s hand was essentially forced to approve spot bitcoin ETFs is currently dragging its feet on ether-based products.  Europe, Singapore, Australia and Dubai also have approved bitcoin ETFs available in their respective regions. The U.K. will soon allow crypto-traded notes to be traded on the London Stock Exchange starting in May, while Australia is expected to approve them in June this year.  See also: The Bitcoin ETF Approval: Full Coverage  The Hong Kong news is positive especially considering the city’s role as a regional financial hub, perhaps opening the door for nearby neighbors like Japan and Singapore to also open the floodgates to spot bitcoin investing.  However, unlike the unlock that happened in the U.S., which is one of the main drivers of the recent bitcoin rally that has pushed the asset to ever newer all-time highs, there are reasons to doubt billions in new capital will flood into the market. Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. this year have been some of the fastest growing financial products ever — already accounting for billions in assets under management.  But as financial markets guru Noelle Acheson has pointed out, there is a gulf between the relative market size of the U.S. and Hong Kong.  “A handful of $BTC and $ETH futures ETFs listed in Hong Kong in December 2022, and today, more than a year later, have a combined AUM of just under $170 million,” Acheson tweeted. “For contrast, $BITO – the largest U.S.-listed BTC futures ETF – has an AUM of over $2.8 billion.”",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,ASIA | BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/04/15/hong-kong-boards-the-etf-express,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a43db3ff350d6330680a39579ab08b2cbf3bdb35-5501x3094.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

While ahead 4% over the past 24 hours, ETH is lower by about 4% since rising to nearly $3,300 earlier Monday on word (as yet still unconfirmed) that multiple Hong Kong-based spot bitcoin and ether ETFs had been approved.  Downside pressure in bitcoin {{BTC}} has resumed as well, with that crypto now modestly lower over the past 24 hours to $64,200 after earlier Monday nearly reaching $67,000.  The broader CoinDesk 20 Index is ahead 0.68% over the past 24 hours.  Alongside, Solana's {{SOL}}, gave up a large proportion of its overnight gains, dropping to around $140 from as high as $155 early Monday morning. That's also down from $175 reached on Friday.  Bitcoin, ether and the rest of crypto plunged on Saturday – with bitcoin dropping to the $61,000 area and ether below $3,000 – as Iran launched a bombing campaign on Israel, but the sector had regained some footing later in the weekend.  Singapore-based digital assets trading house QCP Capital said in a note to investors that historically, buying the dip on the outbreak of major geopolitical conflicts has been a profitable trade.  Ed Goh, head of trading at liquidity provider B2C2, said the firm has seen consistent buying in BTC, especially on the dip over the weekend. “57% of our flow has been to the buy side,” said Goh. He also added that altcoin activity remains high and they have seen a bias towards buying for alts.  Bitcoin’s halving event is fast approaching on April 19, which some traders are predicting could trigger a short-term “sell the news” reaction before and after the event.

However, after the meme coin’s rally in March and then the subsequent dump in April, it looks like investors, especially whales, are finally getting ready to start taking profit. This is evidenced by a number of large DOGE transactions that were flagged going into exchanges over the last day. Dogecoin Whales Move 800 Million DOGE To Exchanges The movement of coins to centralized exchanges can be very bearish for the price of a cryptocurrency. This is because the move to centralized exchanges often points to a selling spree as investors look to take advantage of the deep liquidity that is provided by these exchange platforms. This reason is why the massive amounts of DOGE tokens being sent to centralized exchanges are concerning for the community. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETF Issuers Push Holdings To 4.27% Of BTC Supply Amid Crash To $61,000 Over the course of the last day, the on-chain whale tracking platform Whale Alert reported a number of large DOGE transactions that carried tokens to centralized exchanges. The largest of these transactions happened on April 14, when a single transaction was carrying 600 DOGE tokens to the Binance exchange. At the time of the transaction, the total stash of tokens being transferred was worth around $92.3 million. However, with the DOGE price increasing since then, the value of the tokens contained in this transaction could be closer to $95 million at the time of this writing. Hours later, after the first transaction, two other transactions followed, also carrying notable amounts of DOGE tokens. The second transaction, which carried 100 million DOGE tokens worth $15.28 million, headed for the Robinhood exchange. The third transaction of the trio was also headed to the Robinhood exchange, carrying 99.25 million tokens worth $16.15 million. In total, approximately 800 million DOGE tokens to centralized exchanges, signaling a potential sell-off on the horizon. Can DOGE Surge From Here? Despite the bearish pressure that seems to categorize Dogecoin lately, the longer-term outlook for the meme coin has remained bullish, especially among crypto analysts. Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade has continued to maintain a bullish stance on the meme coin, which he believes could pull a significant rally soon. Related Reading: Ethereum Whales Go On Buying Spree As Market Crash Leaves Retail Panicking Tardigrade’s latest analysis of Dogecoin saw a bullish formation on the chart, which could lead to a 100% rally. The move, which the analyst expects to happen sometime in April following the Bitcoin Halving, is expected to see the DOGE price rise as high as $0.4 in the short term. However, first, the meme coin’s price would have to break above $0.205, which has developed into significant resistance for the altcoin. But, as the crypto analyst explains, a break above this level would confirm the bullish breakout. For now, Dogecoin is still struggling to break through this $0.205 resistance and has since been rejected from this level. It is currently sitting at $0.165, with a 5.51% increase on the last day and a 20% decrease on the last week, according to data from Coinmarketcap.

Plunging to a gut-wrenching $60,850 before staging a partial recovery to hover around $64,500, this sudden price drop has left the crypto community scrambling for answers. Veteran trader Peter Brandt, known for his eagle eye on market patterns, has stepped into the ring to offer his insights, sparking debate about what this means for Bitcoin’s future. Related Reading: CEO Throws Cold Water On May Ethereum ETF Approval – Impact On Price Bitcoin At A Crossroads: The ‘End Run’ Theory Brandt, a seasoned campaigner in the often-unpredictable world of crypto trading, sees the recent price action as a potential turning point. He uses the intriguing term “end run” to describe this pivotal moment. Borrowed from the world of sports, an end run signifies a strategic maneuver designed to bypass obstacles and gain an advantage. In the context of Bitcoin’s recent dip, Brandt suggests it could be a strategic shift in the market dynamics, paving the way for a significant move in either direction. End run completed in Bitcoin $BTC@chartwizardsnft pic.twitter.com/YlHISyT85D — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) April 13, 2024 Brandt’s analysis hinges on a technical indicator – a symmetrical triangle pattern forming on Bitcoin’s price chart. This pattern often signals a period of consolidation before a breakout, either upwards or downwards. According to technical analysis principles, a breakdown from the bottom trendline of the triangle could usher in a bearish trend, while a breakout from the top could trigger a bullish surge. Brandt’s interpretation of the recent drop as the “end run” implies Bitcoin is poised for a breakout, but the question remains – which direction will it break? Bullish Undercurrent Despite Short-Term Jitters While the immediate future might be shrouded in uncertainty, Brandt maintains a firm belief in Bitcoin’s long-term potential. He has previously predicted Bitcoin reaching a staggering $200,000 by 2025, a testament to his unwavering confidence in the cryptocurrency’s ability to achieve substantial growth. Viewing the current dip as a healthy correction within a larger upward trend aligns with his overall bullish stance on Bitcoin’s trajectory. Total crypto market cap is currently at $2.352 trillion. Chart: TradingView The Crypto Market: A Balancing Act Between Fear And Opportunity The recent Bitcoin price drop and the subsequent analysis from Peter Brandt have exposed the inherent tension within the cryptocurrency market – a constant tug-of-war between fear and opportunity.

Bitcoin Drawdown Had Nearly Put Short-Term Whales Under Pressure As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, BTC’s price had neared the Realized Price of the short-term holder whales during the recent drop, but had still managed to remain above the level. The “Realized Price” here refers to an on-chain indicator that, in short, keeps track of the cost basis (that is, the acquisition price) of the average investor in the Bitcoin market. Related Reading: PEPE Preparing For A 54% Move? Analyst Thinks So When the spot price of the cryptocurrency is trading above this level, it means that the investors as a whole are in a state of unrealized profits right now. On the other hand, it being under implies the overall market is carrying losses. In the context of the current discussion, the Realized Price of the entire Bitcoin market isn’t of interest, but that of only a part of it: the short-term holder (STH) whales. The STHs refer to the BTC investors who bought their coins within the past 155 days, while the whales are categorized as entities holding greater than 1,000 BTC. As such, the STH whales would refer to the large investors who bought during the last five months. Naturally, the Realized Price of this group would indicate the average whale buying price over the past five months (and this price would obviously have to be one the cryptocurrency had traded at on some occasion inside this timeframe). Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Realized Price for the STH whales over the last decade: The value of the metric appears to have shot up in recent months | Source: CryptoQuant From the graph, it’s visible that the Realized Price of the STH whales has rapidly climbed alongside the sharp rally Bitcoin has gone through this year. This makes sense, as the STHs represent the new hands coming into the market, who would have to buy at higher prices as the asset’s surge would continue. Not only that, but the STHs who age past the 155 days mark (that is, those who bought at the relatively low prices) exit out of the cohort, thus raising the average even further. The group that these matured investors advance to is known as the long-term holder (LTH) cohort. In the same chart, the quant has also attached the data for the Realized Price of the LTH whales as well. It would appear that these veteran whales have their cost basis at just $21,500, meaning that these investors would be getting some big rewards for their patience. In contrast, the STH whales have their Realized Price at $60,700.

25793319,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=603297,1713189639,"Bitcoin Goes Pro: UFC Winner Wants $300,000 Bonus Paid In BTC","Bitcoin adoption is soaring across sectors, emerging as a standard in the sports industry. Demonstrating this trend, a UFC winner has requested his bonus to be paid in Bitcoin, underscoring the cryptocurrency’s increasing prominence within the sports sector. Bitcoin Becomes Price Of Choice For UFC Winner Brazilian professional Mixed Martial Artist (MMA) and UFC 300 winner, Renato Moicano took to X (formerly Twitter) on April 14, to demand that his $300,000 bonus should be paid in Bitcoin. The declaration came as a pleasant surprise to crypto enthusiasts under the comment, as many supported his new stance on the world’s most popular cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Market Expert Reveals Why Solana Price Is Poised To Go Higher On Saturday, April 13, Moicano knocked out American MMA, Jalin Turner at UFC 300, achieving his third consecutive win. Following this victorious match, Moicano took the mic to give a quick but powerful speech. The UFC winner expressed his love for America, emphasizing his admiration for the Constitution and the fundamental right of freedom of speech protected by the First Amendment. He passionately recommended that anyone who truly loved their country should study the teachings of Ludwig Von Mises, an American Austrian school economist known for his book, ‘The Six Lessons of the Austrian Economic School.’ The Six Lessons of Mises is a compilation of the author’s perspectives on inflation, capitalism, socialism, interventionism, foreign investment and politics. Moicano has encouraged people to read this book, suggesting that understanding its economic principles could contribute significantly to the development and prosperity of the nation. Interestingly, the Six Lessons of Mises is also a book considered by many as a cornerstone for understanding Bitcoin. The lessons offer valuable insights into addressing modern economic challenges, some of which Bitcoin effectively addresses today. As a digital asset perceived to be the ultimate digital store of value, Bitcoin could serve as a hedge against economic inflation, providing investors with a safe place to preserve their wealth amidst economic turmoil. The cryptocurrency was also previously seen as a leading indicator of inflation, suggesting that Bitcoin could be used to track inflationary movements. The Rise Of Crypto In Sports Sector Since its inception, cryptocurrencies have been growing rapidly in different sectors, providing solutions to the limitations of traditional finance systems. This rapid expansion not only underscores the growing adoption and acceptance of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies across diverse sectors but also highlights the increasing interest among athletes and sports organizations. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Sell Pressure Is Dropping – Here’s What It Means For Price While Moicano showed support for Bitcoin by requesting for his bonus to be paid in the popular cryptocurrency, Vechain, a smart contract-compatible blockchain, landed a $100 million five-year heavyweight partnership with the UFC on April 13. Additionally, earlier in 2022, the mixed martial arts company announced that it would be paying its fighter’s bonuses in cryptocurrencies. These developments effectively highlight the rise of cryptocurrencies in the sports sector, extending beyond UFC to include other sports like football, NBA and more.

42391008,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdRxYL,1713189267,"Bitcoin First, Not Only: Fostering Widespread Adoption Through Education","As bitcoin {{BTC}} continues to gain traction worldwide, the approach to introducing it to newcomers plays a crucial role in its widespread adoption. While some advocates firmly believe in a ""Bitcoin only"" narrative, this aggressive stance can often hinder the conversation and deter potential adopters.  Instead, a ""Bitcoin first"" approach, which prioritizes education and understanding, may prove more effective in fostering genuine interest and long-term investment in bitcoin.  Burak Tamac is an adjunct professor at Montclair State University, teaching politics and technology.  This essay is part of CoinDesk’s “Future of Bitcoin” package published to coincide with the fourth Bitcoin “halving” in April 2024.  The limitations of the ""Bitcoin only"" approach  Proponents of the ""Bitcoin only"" narrative often argue passionately for the superiority of bitcoin over other cryptocurrencies. However, this approach can come across as confrontational and off-putting to those who are new to the concept. When people feel attacked or told that their current investments are wrong, they are more likely to disengage from the conversation entirely. This is particularly true in countries like Turkey, where many individuals are already familiar with alternative investments like altcoins.  The power of education  To effectively promote bitcoin adoption, the focus should shift from telling people what to do to providing them with the knowledge to make informed decisions. By presenting bitcoin as the first step in understanding the broader cryptocurrency landscape, educators can help people grasp the unique features and advantages of bitcoin without disparaging other investments outright.  When individuals learn about the Bitcoin network's decentralized nature, its limited supply and its potential as a store of value, they can better appreciate its significance. This foundation of knowledge allows them to evaluate other cryptocurrencies more critically and recognize the authenticity of bitcoin's value proposition.  See also: Allen Farrington: Capital in the 21st Century | Opinion  Encouraging people to blindly invest in bitcoin without proper understanding is a short-sighted approach. When individuals buy bitcoin solely based on hype or fear of missing out, they are more likely to panic sell during market fluctuations. This behavior not only harms their personal financial well-being but also discourages them to learn more about bitcoin.  In contrast, when people invest in bitcoin after learning about its fundamentals and long-term potential, they are more likely to hold their investments through market cycles. This informed decision-making promotes stability and helps to build a stronger, more resilient Bitcoin community.  The way forward  To accelerate bitcoin adoption, I believe advocates should prioritize education to start a conversation; and the education should not start about what they do wrong, but what they can do more. By presenting bitcoin as the first step in a journey of financial literacy and technological understanding, we can create a more welcoming and inclusive environment for newcomers.  By adopting a ""Bitcoin first"" approach that prioritizes education and understanding, we can create a more welcoming and empowering environment for newcomers.

42391003,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdRxIx,1713188894,‘I'm a Pro-Freedom Candidate’: John Deaton on his Senate Race With Elizabeth Warren,"If you’re looking for a “Pro-Crypto” vs. “Anti-Crypto” political showdown, good luck finding a juicier battle than the Massachusetts race for the U.S. Senate.  On Team Anti-Crypto, of course, is Senator Elizabeth Warren (D), who famously declared that she would build an “anti-crypto army.” Senator Warren has held her seat for over a decade. Especially in left-leaning Massachusetts, her reelection had seemed inevitable.  John Deaton is a speaker at this year’s Consensus festival, in Austin, Texas, May 29-31.  Enter attorney John Deaton, a newcomer to politics, who has a very different take on crypto. Deaton is a former U.S. Marine and looks the part — bald, goateed, muscular. And he knows the crypto space well. I first spoke with him last summer about his work on behalf of “XRP Army.” Deaton was baffled by the SEC’s four-year lawsuit against Ripple, calling it “the most over-broad, far-reaching, outrageous case I’ve ever read. It made no sense.” Deaton personally intervened (counter-suing the SEC) and was largely vindicated, as Ripple (mostly) won the blockbuster case last July and the SEC later dropped its own suit.  Deaton, who has received donations from Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Chris Larsen, the company’s co-founder and various members of the crypto community, insists he’s not an “XRP Attorney,” but was simply combating government overreach. And that fight against overreach seems to be his animating principle — with crypto a key part of the battle. Warren, for example, said she supports a government-issued central bank digital currency (CBDC). Deaton’s take? “If the government can control your money through a programmable CBDC — where they can turn it off or turn it on, or limit its geographic abilities — you're talking about complete control over the individual's life,” says Deaton. “They get to see where you spend your money, how you spend your money. It really would turn America into potentially a surveillance state.”  This is why Deaton calls himself the pro-freedom candidate. In perhaps a sneak preview of what he’ll share onstage at Consensus 2024, Deaton explains the crypto regulation he’d support if elected to the Senate, he articulates why he believes in crypto (even though he brushes off the label “pro crypto candidate”), and why if he was in charge of the Senate Banking Committee, he’d have “a lot of fun” asking questions of SEC Chair Gary Gensler.  Warren is still rated a “solid” bet for re-election (according to the Cook Report), but her race with Deaton is closely watched for whether “crypto” can move the needle on voting patterns this year.  Interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.  What’s your pitch to the crypto/web3 space? Why should they want you to win?  John Deaton: I'm not a pro-crypto candidate, I'm a pro-freedom candidate. When I was on Anthony Scaramucci’s podcast, at the end of the interview, we did a word association — he would say a name or a word, and he wanted my immediate reaction. He said ""Bitcoin."" And I said ""freedom.""  Bitcoin is digital property. It's a digital form of gold. At the end of the day, it's about property rights. I don't believe the government should be in the business of telling people what they can own and what they can't own. That’s really why I got involved in the space.  Can you clarify why you got involved with Ripple?  A lot of people, early on, called me the “XRP Attorney” because I had sued the SEC and intervened in the Ripple case. The irony of that is I had very little investment in XRP. [My holdings in] Bitcoin [were] at least 10 times more. It really wasn't about the underlying token. Obviously I’m not a [XRP] maximalist. I’m a freedom maximalist. It was about the government's overreach.  Putting aside government overreach, what are your overall thoughts on blockchain tech?  Do I believe in digitalization? Do I believe that tokenization of real-world assets and the blockchain underlying technology is a way to revolutionize finance? Yes. I am a believer in the technology.  For example, we have a Department of Defense that hasn't passed an audit in years. Like, they don't know where billions of dollars are. Imagine if all of that was done on the ledger? And you have absolute, immutable proof of where every penny is spent. It would be there on the blockchain. So I think Web3 and the blockchain technology is here to stay.  If you’re elected to the Senate, what kind of crypto policy and regulation would you push for?  A lot of people think that crypto and stablecoins are a threat to the U.S. dollar. I disagree with that. I think they’re a way to reduce friction in the system, and improve efficiencies, and actually bolster the dollar's dominance, if done the right way. So, stablecoin legislation that doesn't affect the user, but making sure that AML and KYC and the rules are being applied to the issuers and their companies, I favor that.  And I favor regulation that makes it clear that if you give entrepreneurs real guidance, they can meet it. I think that regulatory clarity is the final step to really fulfilling this innovation and seeing it grow. To make it clear what constitutes a security. And then you could classify them [cryptocurrencies] sort of like the United Kingdom did, where it says, “We have security tokens, we have utility tokens, we have exchange tokens,” and then there's always a hybrid of one in between. Then you just lay out those guidelines, and make it clear. Then I think we’re going to see an explosion in the industry.  Your opponent, Senator Warren, has a very different take on crypto. Where do you most disagree with her?  In the first [Senate Banking Committee] hearing with Gary Gensler, she gave him the questions she was going to ask, and as well as the suggested answers. That's not how you conduct oversight. Her job is to hold Gary Gensler accountable, asking tough questions. And FOIA requests showed that she orchestrated that testimony. So, to me, that disqualifies her right then and there.  At yesterday’s hearing, she was asking the deputy treasurer questions about if a validator is in Iran, somehow that means Iran is making millions of dollars. Now, you and I and everybody reading this knows that a validator could be anywhere. It could be in Iran, it could be anywhere else in the world. That's what's a decentralized distributed ledger system is. But a validator doesn't get cash. If anything, a validator could get paid in the native asset of the network, whether it's Bitcoin or Ethereum, but then you have to have an off-ramp. And the off-ramps and on-ramps are the exchanges, and they already comply with AML/KYC.  So, for her to say that these validating nodes have to comply with KYC/AML, that's an impossible feat. And she's a smart woman, right? So there's only two things with Elizabeth Warren. One, she either has a fundamental misunderstanding of the technology, or she's intentionally misleading the American people. I think she's a bright person, so I think it's the latter.  Can you explain?  She went on Chuck Todd's ""Meet the Press,"" and stated that America is ready for a central bank digital currency issued by the Federal Reserve. I think that’s what her motivation is. When you think about it, why is the senator from Massachusetts so focused on crypto? Just think about that. We have illegal immigration, a debt crisis, with the government $34 trillion in debt. Personal credit cards are over a trillion dollars. We have an opioid crisis in the country, which is related to the southern border. We have all these foreign wars going on. And on her first announcement of her reelection, she says she's going after crypto. And that made me scratch my head, and think, ""why?""  We have all of these real emergencies, why are you focused on crypto? And then she went and said that she favors the Federal Reserve's central bank digital currency, which I view as one of the biggest threats to freedom of my lifetime. Because if the government can control your money through a programmable CBDC — where they can turn it off or turn it on, or limit its geographic abilities — you're talking about complete control over the individual's life.  They get to see where you spend your money, how you spend your money. It really would turn America into potentially a surveillance state. And that’s extremely dangerous. So I think she’s getting it wrong on multiple levels, but I also believe there's an agenda here. Her anti-crypto bill was written by the bankers. Right? This is a proven fact, not opinion. The Banking Institute Policy wrote her anti-crypto bill. We know that for a fact. The chairman of the Banking Institute Policy of the United States is Jamie Dimon, of JPMorgan Chase, the man who says, from the beginning, that Bitcoin is a fraud, and testified for Senator Warren that the only use case for Bitcoin and crypto is terrorists and all that. And we all know that's nonsense.  And the final thing that she gets wrong, and I think she knows that she's wrong — is that she keeps saying that crypto and Bitcoin is only being used for terrorism and drug cartels and things of that nature. The truth is, it’s something like only 0.03% of crypto is being used [for illicit activities]. For example, we know $900,000 of crypto was used [for illicit activities], whereas HSBC [laundered] $900 million, through the banking system, for the Colombian and Mexican drug cartels. And so it's almost a silly argument that she's making. I’m sure ATM machines have been used in drug deals. We don’t ban ATM machines.  You mentioned Gary Gensler earlier. Let’s say you were in this Senate Banking Committee hearing. What are the questions you’d ask him?  The first thing I'd ask him is why he was having meetings with [FTX founder] Sam Bankman-Fried, who was running an offshore exchange, and denying meetings to someone like Brian Armstrong, of Coinbase, a publicly-traded company and the largest American exchange. I'd ask him who set those meetings up. Why was SBF given such access? Where are the notes? I want to see all of those notes.  At SBF's trial, the testimony was that Sam Bankman-Fried donated $10 million to the Biden administration, to gain access. Why was he given such great access? That would be one of the first areas that I ask him. I'd spend a lot of time with Gary Gensler, and have a lot of fun with him.  Last question. Any predictions for the crypto space?  Well, I think the biggest thing is that people need to understand that crypto has a large voice. From what I’ve been told, before the ETFs, there were 52 million Americans who owned crypto. Then the ETFs came out. Now it could be as high as 70 to 80 million. You’re talking about probably one out of four adults who own bitcoin or crypto.  I’ve been saying that in this election, freedom is on the line. So they need to go out and vote for candidates who favor innovation and freedom. I believe that Bitcoin and crypto is here to stay. That doesn’t mean that 20,000 tokens are here to stay, you know what I mean? But it means that projects with utility are here to stay.

Turns out it's the prediction market contract.  ""No"" shares on crypto-based platform Polymarket are trading at 92 cents, which means that should China not invade Taiwan by the end of the year, holders get an 8.7% return on their money.

Prediction Markets Are Placing Bets  Government bonds have historically been a bet on the future prospects of a country.  Political instability, economic turmoil, and the possibility of war are hallmark characteristics of a developing nation. Investors demand to be rewarded for the risk, hence the higher yield on these bonds. El Salvador's bonds have historically traded at a higher premium than a developed nation like Canada because the likelihood that catastrophe would strike the nation is considered to be much higher, but that trend is changing as its President's bitcoin bet and war on organized crime appears to be paying off.  Taiwan's government is fairly stable, and the country has a high degree of economic development, while also running a surplus. The market knows the government is regularly paying its debt, so there's not much of a premium that can be commanded on the bond market.  Of course, an invasion would throw this into complete disarray. But such an event isn't likely, based on how the bond market is pricing things. One might say that the prediction market is overpricing the potential for such an event, hence free money that yields more than the country's own government bonds.

42391013,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdRxxz,1713188531,Allen Farrington: Capital in the 21st Century,"Bitcoin has spurred a renaissance of thought on the question of “what is money?” Bitcoin is often linked to the Austrian school of economics without much thought as to why, but pondering this question allows for the most thoughtful justification: money is an emergent order and understanding its operation depends on appreciating irreducible uncertainty, subjective value and methodological individualism. Often described as a logical treatment of a subject fundamentally resistant to scientific analysis, the emergence of Bitcoin and its acceptance in the market has many Austrians rightly cackling at a real-world proof of the efficacy of the school.  Allen Farrington is a writer and investor in bitcoin. He cowrote ""Bitcoin Is Venice"" and ""Only The Strong Survive,"" and is a cofounder of Axiom, a bitcoin-focused venture firm. A version of this essay was originally published on the Axiom website.  This essay is part of CoinDesk’s “Future of Bitcoin” package published to coincide with the fourth Bitcoin “halving” in April 2024.  On which note, Mises’ monumental ""The Theory of Money and Credit"" is essential reading for any bitcoiner, and Menger’s ""On the Origins of Money"" might be the single best prose answer to the preceding question. More a bitcoiner himself than an Austrian – or at the very least a polymath – Nick Szabo’s writing is essential reading not only for bitcoiners, but for anybody struggling to understand what on earth is going on in the world. Contemporary Austrian economist Rahim Taghizadegan has indeed credited Szabo’s thesis in ""Shelling Out"" as a novel contribution to the school.  That said, we do not think of Axiom as a “money business” – and nor does anybody else, for that matter. We operate in capital markets, and I have personally found it impossible in the past few months to set up a capital markets business without thinking about the nature of capital. The reader will not be surprised in the least to learn I believe there is an intimate connection to money, and hence that capital on a ""Bitcoin Standard"" is likely to be every bit as different as money, and possibly more so.  Joseph Schumpeter’s critique of the nonsense of “equilibrium” as leaving no space for entrepreneurship is as much about capital as anything else. Without entrepreneurs, there is little to distinguish productive capital from mere assets: animate matter, rich with potential, from mere inanimate stuff. One of the many lessons of Israel Kirzner’s analysis of the conceptual links between competition and entrepreneurship is to force the realization that capital is both heterogeneous and unavoidably the product of human creativity. This heterogeneity is arguably the soundest conceptual grounding, or the best formulated axiom, for a non-circular definition of “liquidity.” The perfectly liquid capital is money, which is perfectly homogeneous. Money bears no uncertainty because it is the standard of value against which uncertain endeavors are to be measured. The role of the entrepreneur is to embrace uncertainty by accumulating capital; putting it to heterogeneous use in the creative and competitive pursuit of the satisfaction of the value of others.  So far, so simple – and so seemingly axiomatic. But if you are reading this you are most likely interested in Bitcoin, and if you have been kind enough to invest in Axiom Venture Fund I then you most certainly believe that we are still early. And so, I put it to the reader that this – or, perhaps, the consequences of this – is not at all widely understood.  There are plenty of definitions of capital out there, but my favorite definition is not at all technical and is not from an Austrian. It is that of Hernando de Soto. It is not even a “definition,” per se, but more of an image. This is exactly why I like it. In the dismal science, rhetorical flourish is hard to come by – especially while remaining somewhat accurate and without spiraling into statist agitprop.  In his fantastic ""The Mystery of Capital"", de Soto calls capital, economic potential energy. To my mind, this helpfully emphasizes two things:  that work has been done, but the fruits of that work have not been realized, and;  that they can be realized, with intention – with human action  It is within our power, not as homo economici, but as individual thinking humans, to tap this reserve of potential energy based on what we value. It is not the preserve of the omniscient, omnipotent capital tsar who allocates all capital from a palace in the sky. Nor is Hayek obsoleted by advances in artificial intelligence, to cite exactly some such fashionable statist agitprop. It is the entrepreneur that is the motor of the world. She thinks as an individual; she acts in the moment; and she allocates at the margin.  Steve Jobs, an entrepreneur if ever there was one, once famously said,  “I think one of the things that really separates us from the high primates is that we’re tool builders. I read a study that measured the efficiency of locomotion for various species on the planet. The condor used the least energy to move a kilometer. And humans came in with a rather unimpressive showing, about a third of the way down the list. It was not too proud a showing for the crown of creation. So, that didn’t look so good. But, then somebody at Scientific American had the insight to test the efficiency of locomotion for a man on a bicycle. And a man on a bicycle, a human on a bicycle, blew the condor away, completely off the top of the charts. And that’s what a computer is to me. What a computer is to me is it’s the most remarkable tool that we’ve ever come up with, and it’s the equivalent of a bicycle for our minds.""  This is usually understood as commentary on technology, but I think it is more about capital. A less romantic framing, perhaps, than “economic potential energy,” capital is tools. Jobs’ point is just how potent software is as a form of capital. But ultimately all capital magnifies the desirability of the output of some exertion of time and energy. A bicycle is one example, and a computer is another. At the risk of mixing metaphors, capital is the bicycle of labor; of time, of effort, and of the grind to produce value by hand.  Capital is tools.  2. More things, cheaper things, new things  What does money have to do with all this? The non-answer is to say that money is the most liquid form of capital, but that is to subscribe to a circular explanation. If by “liquid” we simply mean, “the time and difficulty required to transform something into money,” then money can be transformed into money in zero time and with zero difficulty, hence it must be maximally liquid. We have both stated and proven a tautology. The fiat economists would be proud*.  I suggest we attempt to invert this understanding of liquidity. Instead of trying to capture how easily and quickly we can convert capital into money, what if what we meant was how easily and quickly we can convert money into capital?  Okay, why? Is this even different or am I just playing with words?  I think it is different because it forces us to think about what it is we really want; what we want is wealth. We want more things, cheaper things and new things. And we want the comfort and security of knowing we will be able to produce these things far into the future. We don’t want one more thing, one cheaper thing and one new thing – and we don’t even necessarily want any things right now. We want the potential to create more, cheaper and new.  See also: The Blockchain Industry Must Build for the Real Needs of Real People  Money does none of this. Money is not wealth. Money is a claim on wealth – money is liquid; it is salable. It is the maximally efficient way of communicating the relative value of things we really want. But it is only itself valuable because all these other things it helps us value either exist in the first place, or else could exist, pending our intentional, directed effort to allocate time and energy to bringing them into existence.  Money is neither sufficient nor necessary for wealth. But capital arguably is. Real wealth is illiquid, and the liquidity of money is useful first and foremost because it makes it far easier and more efficient to allocate capital than otherwise.  Another way of thinking about all this is that money is time. More specifically, money is time now. But capital is something different: capital is the cumulative product of having decided not to consume today but to make more, cheaper, and newer the future ability to consume. Capital is all time ever. I do not believe it is appropriate to propose that people should want only to consume in the future – that is none of my business. But we can approach the same issue more subtly: if you wanted to forego consumption and maximize your potential to later consume, could you? What are your incentives either way?  To do our best to minimize the economics jargon once again, we might simply ask: what are you going to do with your time? Are you going to create or consume?  And how do the characteristics of money, as the salable representation of that time, influence your decision? I sincerely believe that this is the killer app for Bitcoin: pricing capital. If there were ever a time to say that Bitcoin Fixes This, here it is.  *Note, by the way, that a tautology cannot be an axiom, as it trivially implies all and only every other tautology as its theorems. Add one tautology to your axioms and you may as well add them all. Nothing is changed, and likely nothing is understood, either. Real axioms require some understanding of the subject matter under exploration.  3. Stocks and flows  But is this even broken? Can’t we price capital now?  We can, but my goodness is it difficult! If you look at what has happened in capital markets over the last fifteen years, at least, this will become clearer and clearer.  Until very recently I worked in this world. Indeed, it was the only (adult) job I have ever had besides this one. I enjoyed it greatly and am grateful for having the opportunity to study and learn as I did. In this role, I chipped in here and there teaching the new hires the basics of financial theory. What I dreamed up to teach them I was pitching at folks who I assumed were extremely intelligent but who had no experience of economics or finance. I found that an invaluable tool to explore this was by using the concepts of stocks and flows.  Below is a cartoon version of a balance sheet and an income statement, in which I attempt to visually convey how the two evolve over time (see next page). In that pedagogical context, I was trying to explain as much from first principles as possible the difference between returns and what is commonly called “growth” but is really just an “increase.”  All this is intended to represent the cycle of capital through a business. You get liquid, homogeneous capital (money), you transform it into illiquid, heterogeneous capital (productive assets), to create a product, keeping a little liquid to cover the costs of delivering the product; and if you profit, that means you get to go again and create even more capital, except that this time you get to fund it yourself.  In the context of financial analysis, one of the key implications I intended to communicate with this principle is that the measure of success is not that the yellow number goes up, and it’s not even that the dark blue number goes up. It’s that the dark blue to purple ratio stays high. Because that is the only sustainable way that the orange number can go up. And this is where wealth comes from. Everything else here is valuable only insofar as it lets us do this efficiently.  But, of course, in the world of quarterly, profit and loss (P&L) finance, nobody cares. They want the yellow number to go up at all costs – which might be a good thing, but it might not – and in particular they want the ratio of successive yellow numbers to go up. They call this ratio “growth,” even though it is really an “increase.” It is a dimensionless ratio of one flow to another. A real “growth rate” has the dimensions of one over time, like the ratio of profit over a period to its funding at the start of that period, or dark blue to purple above. The reader can hopefully see that what this ratio captures is the real, causal, time-dependent process by which the ability to produce grows.  We want the potential to create more, cheaper and new.  This misunderstanding – that we should care about short-term flows rather than long-term rates of return on stocks – I would say is basically the original sin of fiat finance and fiat economics. It is how you get the idea that, “we need to stimulate the economy”; it’s why you might think there is nothing wrong with gutting manufacturing capabilities and energy infrastructure because services are higher margin and “scale better”; it’s how you end up foaming at the mouth over “quarterly earnings,” as if any meaningful investment project could take three months and as if the measure of its success would be a flow and not a stock.  It’s also how you get the idea that trading jpegs is productive, or that the product of capital accumulation should be artificial scarcity rather than abundance; not more and cheaper but capped and expensive. It’s how you think that if you create a simulacrum of wealth, at no cost, real wealth can somehow follow just because you have bootstrapped an idea. Not productive capacity: not the potential to create more, cheaper and new; but claims on wealth that you cross your fingers somebody else will actually work to create. And it’s how you end up with one of the greatest misallocations of capital in the history of venture capital and possibly in the history of capital markets.  Real capital is scarce – precious, even. It is, after all, accumulated time. if it is going towards something stupid and short-termist, then it isn’t going towards anything intelligent and long-termist. If the money we use to decide how to allocate capital does not reflect this scarcity, we will think there is no cost to short-termism. The incentive here is not wealth, it’s just profit. It is not a stock, it’s just a flow. It is not to create tools, it’s just to dismantle them and trade the parts for fun.  4. The point of profit  The reader might wonder if there is anything really wrong with that? Am I revealing a paternalistic pedantry of no clear relation to economics? Greed Is Good, right? What is the point of investing in the first place if it is not to profit? Isn’t profit a marker – nay, the marker – of entrepreneurial success and sustainable economic contribution?  See also: Crypto Fear & Greed Index Hits Highest Level Since Bitcoin's 2021 High  As a final tease, I would put forward that a far better contentious proverb to employ here than Gordon Gekko’s motto would be from the New Testament of the King James Bible, in which we are counseled that, the love of money is the root of all evil. Unfortunately, this is commonly misquoted as, money is the root of all evil, which does a dire disservice to the message. The two could hardly be more different. It would be a little odd for the general partner of a bitcoin-focused financial services firm to believe that money is the root of all evil, and yet I have a great deal of sympathy for 1 Timothy 6:10. I think it can even be a potent tool to distinguish not the technology but the cultures of Bitcoin and crypto, and Bitcoin and fiat.  I believe it is completely backwards to think that the point of investing is profit. The point of profit is investing.  Money means nothing without the capital, and the products of capital, that it prices. We like to think it means “our time,” which is true to an extent, but our time is not valuable in the slightest without the stocks of capital that multiply its productivity. Profit means nothing beyond the means to continue compounding capital in a truly independent manner. There is capital employed without profit, but there is no profit without capital employed. Moreover, profit is the informational signal that the way you are creating capital is valued by others. Profits are great, but returns are better.  To ground this more in everyday experience: if you knew your money was going to be more valuable in the future, how would you invest?  The logical approach would be to invest such that your return, while still compounding in value, would come as late as possible. You want your return as far in the future as it can be, partly because the later it comes the more value it will have compounded. But partly also because that is more efficient than constantly having to think of new projects, developing new skills, testing new markets and so on.  This means that at a personal level, you are incentivized to develop skills as specific as possible, crystallize the value of these skills by creating capital as heterogeneous and illiquid as possible, and spend as much time as possible thinking about deepening these skills and crystallizing this value.  But what if your money was going to be less valuable in the future? Well, all of that would be flipped. You would want your return as soon as possible and you’d want the optionality of new projects and new markets, which means you are incentivized to develop skills as general as possible and hold capital as liquid and homogeneous as possible.  This would mean you are incentivized to stay on top of everything happening in the immediate term, to trade around it, and to spend little time – or no time – focusing on the long term. Any wealth you do own or that you can create, you really ought to financialize to increase its liquidity. Better yet, you ought to financialize somebody else’s wealth. Even better still, you ought to leverage somebody else’s financialized wealth – force others to leverage to compete, misallocate more capital or even start to consume it, create more money and ensure everybody’s money will be less valuable in the future – so we can start this merry-go-round all over again.  In the latter, as long as you profit, everything is fine. In fact, if you have sufficient capability to financialize, you don’t even need profit now. You can promise endless future profits, “grow” (i.e., “increase”), sell the rights to them, and move on. Everything becomes reducible to its immediate flows. But as you gradually strip away your own and everybody else’s capital – as you dismantle, trade, and consume every tool – you will find returns to be more and more elusive and, eventually, impossible. The only important question becomes, who is holding the bag?  Bitcoin fixes this. Bitcoin forces us to think first and foremost about the stock. It enables us to think far more clearly than we would otherwise about the potential to create more things, cheaper things, and new things. This is no mere thought experiment, it is happening around us, at a bewilderingly accelerating rate. It’s happening in mining, in the Lightning Network, in Nostr right now. And in the long run? We wouldn’t dare be so arrogant as to suggest what opportunities can be known. Properly incentivized, purposeful, acting humans are nothing if not creative, and Bitcoin is nothing if not an inducement to create …  5. Bitcoin’s killer app  Whilst it is technically correct to say, “Bitcoin mining secures the network,” I find this explanation to be dry. We might channel my earlier articulated appreciation of de Soto and observe there is a difference between a definition that is technically accurate and one that is rhetorically effective. The hash rate, after all, is a flow. I would argue a more imaginative conception of the global network of Bitcoin miners is as a distributed network of capital – a stock, and a tool – that earns a return which is contingent on energy efficiency, and so which incentivizes more energy, cheaper energy and new energy.  More energy because Bitcoin pays for waste and for load balancing. This creates extra profit – not to be cackled over by fat cat executives but to be reinvested in heterogeneous capital to utilize yet more wasted energy and increase productive output. Cheaper energy because this reinvestment will enable efficiency gains, supplementing the returns of energy infrastructure, and will in turn lead to deflation as it is absorbed by the market. And new energy because Bitcoin makes it possible to exploit stranded resources with only an internet connection instead of costly transmission infrastructure.  The Lightning Network may be explained in equally dry terms of “solving Bitcoin’s scalability.” And once again, this is not incorrect, but neither is it exciting. It is once again affirming that this has a technical purpose and is more than just a toy. But it is a purpose that focuses on flows rather than stocks. Instead, we might consider it a distributed network of heterogenous capital allocation that generates a return contingent on enabling payment efficiency. The consequence is more payments, cheaper payments, and new payments.  More payments because fiat payment rails have counterparty risk, jurisdictional firewalls, and lower bounds on economically rational transferable value – all of which are absent in the Lightning Network. Cheaper payments because the network is robust, antifragile and decentralized, and every node operates as a kind of cellularly automatous market maker in liquidity, meaning routing is competitive and gross costs are driven down, as opposed to the network as a whole seeking to profit maximize by holding costs up. And new payments because all of this enables such innovations as “payment streaming” – very small payments at very short intervals so as to proxy a continuous flow – and programmable exchange – APIs for exchanging proprietary computational resources directly for bearer value in an automated manner rather than at the manual behest of a human.  Nostr has often been characterized as a “Twitter alternative.” This is accurate enough in terms of the first use case to gain any major traction. But it is woefully unimaginative in terms of how widely Nostr could come to be utilized. Instead, we might consider it a distributed means of harnessing the Lightning Network to align the subjective economic valuation of data with the physical cost of the infrastructure facilitating its broadcast. The consequence is more communications, cheaper communications and new communications.  See also: Nostr: A Decentralized Censorship-Resistant Twitter  More communications because the user experience of traditional online communication networks is subject to the design considerations of their operators, whereas the free and open-source nature of the Nostr protocol is such that anybody can build a client or integrate the protocol into an app to create whatever experience they want. Cheaper communications because, via Lightning, the signal of value is directly and bidirectionally expressed in the act of communicating between sender, router and receiver. Building services on Nostr is significantly cheaper than any prior alternative because the network is open and can be tapped into without first building a network effect, and its supporting infrastructure, from scratch. And from the users’ perspective, while legacy social networks are superficially “free,” the adage of, “if the service is free, the product is you,” is healthily absent in Nostr, enabling the ability to be paid for valuable contribution as well as to pay for what is valued, in a disintermediated fashion. And new communications because Nostr doesn’t rely on any centralized entity capable of shutting down politically inconvenient content.  Let us contrast these heterogeneous, illiquid tools to what we have become used to under fiat. We get worse things and more expensive things, and although it is true that we get more things, one has to wonder what kind of thing such an intense pressure to consume drives us to produce more of. I’m not convinced it is worth it. If the source of “more” is pulling forward value from the future that we have no intention of repaying and allocating time towards this activity and away from experiments in the realm of the cheaper and the new, then it is not something I am inclined to celebrate. If the value we believe we have concocted is merely a securitization that makes more liquid a representation of the illiquid, but does not make anything illiquid, it is not something I am inclined to support. The farmer can always boost consumption by eating seed rather than planting it, or by selling that which he has not yet produced. One can always consume more if one is willing to consume capital. But I’d rather we create it.  This is what we would expect to flourish from real capital accumulation. The potential for more things, cheaper things, and newer things that we can rely on if needed, but which we don’t need to consume. Of course, we still have scarce time with which to decide what kind of capital to create, and so the price of capital is critically important as well. I believe that the price of capital is Bitcoin’s killer app. Bitcoin fixes this.  I think there is a plausible argument that this is axiomatically true. Capital is the weave in the fabric of economic life. If Bitcoin fixes capital, then Bitcoin truly does fix everything. Is this our axiom? For all X, Bitcoin fixes X? Is this the mystery of capital?  Sure, but we can go further still. Bitcoin is not an end, but a means. Like all capital, it is a tool to serve humans, and to enable human flourishing. Above even its effect on capital we must hold at the front of our minds its effect on people. A tool does not wield itself. Nor does a business spontaneously emerge. A skilled technician wields a tool and an entrepreneur builds a business. To echo Kirzner, this is a perfectly competitive market. All it takes is an idea and the will to pursue it. Brains and guts. And so, we can echo de Soto once more as well, jettison technical jargon one final time, and end on a rhetorical flourish.

42408475,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaJGuv,1713187954,How Investors Should Handle Celsius in Their Tax Returns This Year,"Failed crypto lender Celsius began issuing refunds in early 2024. But, from a tax perspective, the matter remains unresolved. The lack of clear IRS guidance has left many investors puzzled about how to address these refunds.  At first glance, since investors have only received partial refunds so far (and even under the full restructure plans would only receive up to a 79.20% recovery), many would assume that they’d be able to finally realize losses from their investments after the platform abruptly halted transactions and held user funds back in 2022. But it’s not quite so clearcut.  Michelle Legge is a senior researcher at Koinly, a cryptocurrency calculator used by over 1 million crypto investors in over 20 countries.  The tax implications of Celsius, which finalized its bankruptcy in January, are complex. Creditors are categorized into specific groups, each with different rights and claim treatments. And that’s without even considering those who sold their claims to creditors who’ll face different tax implications on top of this. Furthermore, the preferential way to deal with your Celsius transactions from a tax perspective will also depend on the amount you had in Celsius, your total annual income, and many other circumstances.  Therefore, we strongly recommend that anyone facing significant losses from the Celsius bankruptcy consults with an experienced accountant to determine the most advantageous loss claim for their situation.  This said, for investors who need to file ahead of the 15 April 2023 deadline, there are generally two common scenarios to consider - and one has a far more pressing deadline.  For most investors, since the refunds began in 2024, there's no impact on the 2023 tax return. The reconciliation of Celsius tax implications will be a task for next year’s taxes. We’re all hoping that by the time the next tax deadline roll around, the IRS will have clear guidance on how to deal with these transactions. But, even without this, investors may have a clearer picture of what their overall refund will be from Celsius and therefore have a clearer picture of what their actual loss is.  What these investors need to do in the meantime, is make sure they have all their transaction data from Celsius stored safely (and preferably within a crypto tax calculator like Koinly) so that when that time rolls around next year, they already have the data they need so it’s easy to file.  For other investors, particularly those with large losses on Celsius, many accountants have brought up the idea of claiming what’s known as a Safe Harbor Ponzi Loss.  This is an uncommon kind of itemized deduction that must be claimed in the year of discovery, which would be 2023 for Celsius, so the deadline to claim would be within this tax return. This kind of loss allows a taxpayer to claim a 75% loss initially, and a further 25% once proceedings have come to a close.  A key advantage of this loss type is that it's not limited to what it can offset (unlike capital gains). With a Safe Harbor Ponzi Loss, you can offset the entirety of your loss against your income in the year in which you make the election. When it comes to potential refunds in the future, these would then be considered taxable income.  This is an itemized deduction. Whether it benefits you depends on various factors, including your filing status, potential taxable returns from Celsius, whether your loss exceeds the standard deduction, and other personal circumstances. You should only consider this kind of loss for your 2023 tax return if you’ve spoken to an accountant familiar with your situation, especially because Safe Harbor Ponzi Losses are an uncommon type of loss and therefore may increase the risk of an IRS audit.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | REGULATION,Michelle Legge,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/04/15/how-investors-should-handle-celsius-in-their-tax-returns-this-year,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0228f48f345481c6eb51c437e52f21d1270dbcbc-4032x2268.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

MARA stock increased by 44.5% compared to 166.7% for BTC-USD. In 2023, Net Income hit a record $261.2 million, but most of it was due to one-time gains. In my opinion, the company is swimming upstream, as its efficiency gains need to overcome both the Bitcoin halving every four years as well as the nature of Bitcoin. There is a risk that Marathon Digital could have a dilution event, given that they essentially have to double their hash rate through capital expenditures. In my last article , I stated that Marathon Digital’s ( MARA ) stock would underperform the actual Bitcoin ( BTC-USD )asset. While the company’s stock had done pretty well for itself, the results indicate that you would have still been better off owning the actual Bitcoin. Marathon Digital Stock Underperforms BTC Using September 2023 as the starting point, as this was the bottom for Bitcoin prices, buying MARA stock would have seen an increase in your investment by 44.5% compared to the 166.7% increase in Bitcoin price. Data by YCharts The volatility in holding Bitcoin over the same period is a lot less as well. MARA stock traded as high as $34 in March only to crash and lose close to 50% of its value. The stock is currently trading at a share price of $17.4. This makes Bitcoin a much more superior asset compared to Marathon Digital’s stock as it has achieved a higher reward while being less volatile (i.e. less risky from a Modern Portfolio Theory standpoint). There are two major reasons why I believe that Marathon Digital and other Bitcoin miners will continue to underperform the actual Bitcoin asset class. The first is that I believe the reason for MARA stock’s meteoric rise late last year is liquidity from traders who wanted to get Bitcoin exposure without owning the asset itself. Before January this year, it was harder for the typical layman to gain exposure to Bitcoin in their portfolio. While opening an account with a crypto-exchange such as Coinbase ( COIN ) is simple for active traders, for the everyday layman with a basic 401K it can still be a daunting task. According to an article in NerdWallet, Peter Eberle chief investment officer of crypto investment firm Castle Funds mentions that “Many investors can’t currently get exposure. For example, many people with 401(k)s, IRAs, and similar accounts can’t easily access Bitcoin. These investors will be able to allocate funds going forward. This will drive demand in coming years”. According to that same article by NerdWallet, there are 11 Bitcoin spot ETFs available. Almost all of which are from major reputable firms and have relatively low expense ratios. Below is the information. Franklin Templeton Digital Holdings Trust ( EZBC ) - 0.19% fee Bitwise Bitcoin ETF ( BITB ) - 0.20% fee VanEck Bitcoin Trust ( HODL ) - 0.20% fee ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF ( ARKB ) - 0.21% fee iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ) - 0.25% fee Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ( FBTC ) - 0.25% fee WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund ( BTCW ) - 0.25% fee Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF ( BTCO ) - 0.25% fee Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund ( BRRR ) - 0.25% fee Hashdex Bitcoin ETF ( DEFI ) - 0.90% fee Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( GBTC ) - 1.50% fee The SEC announced the approval for Spot Bitcoin products in January 2024 coincides with the peak of MARA stock. The stock reached an all-time high at that time of around $31 and lost roughly half its value falling to as low as $15. There was another rally in late February but the stock failed to meaningfully break the resistance level of $31. It is my view that the availability of a multitude of Spot Bitcoin ETF options will decrease the demand for Bitcoin mining stocks as investors flock to gain direct exposure instead. In my view, this means that there should be less demand from retail traders as Marathon Digital is no longer the best proxy for Bitcoin. Looking at Marathon Digital as a Business The second reason that I believe that MARA stock will underperform is because the business itself has a lot of challenges. On the surface, Marathon Digital's business seems to be firing on all cylinders. The company achieved a 229% increase in revenue from $117.8 million in 2022 to $387.5 million in 2023. The number of Bitcoins mined hit a record of 12,852 BTC in 2023 compared to 4,144 BTC in 2022. The company’s Energized hash rate more than doubled from 7.0 EH/s in 2022 to 24.7 EH/s in 2023, an increase of 253%. As per the company presentation, management plans to further increase this operational hash rate to around 35 EH/s and 37 EH/s in 2024. The company plans to reach the ambitious target of 50 EH/s essentially doubling capacity. Its latest reported hash rate is at 28.7 EH/s as of the end of February. MARA Investor Presentation (MARA Investor Presentation) Now these are very ambitious targets, however a big elephant in the room is the Bitcoin halving event next week. In simple terms, Bitcoin halving is a periodic scheduled event where the number of new Bitcoin mined per block reduces by half. For holders of the actual Bitcoin asset, this isn’t a big deal as it makes the value of the Bitcoin one already owns even more valuable. However, for miners like Marathon Digital, the number of Bitcoins they can mine is cut in half therefore revenues are cut in half. This affects the company’s future revenues much more than the one-time bump they will see from an increase in Bitcoin price. As of March 2024, the company has 17,381 Bitcoin. Multiply that amount by a Bitcoin price of $70,000 and divide that by the 222.6 million shares number of shares outstanding. The approximate value per share of the company’s Bitcoin holding is only $5.46 per share. So even if the halving event isn’t fully priced in, and BTC has an increase in price, this translates to only a marginal increase in value for MARA stock from the company’s Bitcoin holdings. Meanwhile, the price of Bitcoin will have to roughly double from here Marathon to maintain its Revenue as the amount of Bitcoin it can mine drops by half. The Difficult Economics of Bitcoin Mining Apart from the halving event, in my humble opinion, Marathon Digital as a Bitcoin miner also suffers from difficult business economics. According to the company’s financials in 2023 , Net Income hit a record $261.2 million or $1.06 per share. This is in stark contrast to the Net loss of $694 million or $(6.12) per share in 2022. However, the bulk of this income comes from Gains on digital assets (i.e. Bitcoin that Marathon Digital holds) which were $331.4 million. This is a one-time gain from the rise in Bitcoin prices and the company’s adoption of ASU No. 2023-08 accounting standards. In other words, this Net Income cannot be projected in the future. Looking at the company’s Gross Income for 2023, we can see that Marathon Digital actually lost money by producing Bitcoin. The company has a total cost of revenues of $402 million against revenues of $387.5 million. Of the total cost of revenues, $223.3 million are for Energy and Hosting while $179 million are expenses related to the depreciation of mining rigs. MARA 10-K (MARA 10-K) This leads to the other issue I have with Marathon Digital’s business. Looking at the income statement, the company has very little operating leverage. For most manufacturing and mining companies, fixed costs or capital expenses for equipment are one-time investments that last for 10-20 years. However, for Marathon Digital, equipment, via the mining rigs, is rapidly used up and depreciated. Based on information from the 10-K, the company shortened the estimated useful life for its mining rigs from 5 years to 3 years in 2023. Therefore, the costs to replace its capital equipment can’t be spread over long periods and are expensed almost immediately in cost of revenues. The company is also operating its mining operations at close to full capacity. So there is very little left to be squeezed out of its current equipment. Per the latest earnings transcript . By the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, we were operating near full strength after Garden City was fully energized in October, following several months of regulatory delays. In December, we averaged 90% capacity across all sites and at the same time, we benefited from a huge surge in transaction fees on the Bitcoin network. Putting all these together, what I am saying is that the company will have to continuously spend money to increase Marathon Digital’s number of Bitcoin mined. The company has various initiatives such as its “Two-Phase Immersion Cooling System ” and its “Industry-leading firmware and a control board” to boost efficiency. However, the company is swimming upstream in my opinion as these efficiency gains need to overcome both the Bitcoin halving every four years as well as the nature of Bitcoin which gets harder to mine as time goes on. To examine whether the company has the reserves to continue its expansion, we can examine the Balance Sheet. Marathon Digital as of March 2024 has a combined unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $324.3 million and 17,381 bitcoin. Last year, the company reduced its debt load from $748 million to $331 million, a reduction of 56%. However, this was off the back of massive shareholder dilution, which I discussed in my last article. In total, cash and bitcoin holdings at $70,000 is roughly $1.2 billion. In my view, there is a risk that Marathon Digital could have a dilution event given that they essentially have to double their hash rate through capital expenditures. Conclusion It may seem unfair that I am picking on Marathon Digital here given that other Bitcoin miners will be facing the same issues. However, I like using Marathon Digital as a benchmark because it is one of the leaders in this space. The company is not profitable on the Gross Income level as it faces the challenges of Bitcoin mining. While it is true that the company could achieve profitability if Bitcoin prices continue to increase from here wouldn't it be better to just gain exposure through a spot Bitcoin ETF instead? As discussed, unlike actual physical metals miners, companies like Marathon Digital have low levels of operational leverage. Given the challenges that the company is facing and the easy availability of actual Spot Bitcoin ETFs in my view, it is more advantageous for the average retail investor to simply buy a Bitcoin ETF for the exposure.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4683623-marathon-digital-now-better-to-just-own-bitcoin-instead-mara-stock-crypto?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/25792211.jpeg

The country has been pushing for crypto bans over energy concerns for some years.  Norway's government is introducing a law for data centers partly in an effort to block energy-intensive crypto mining in the country, according to a report by local news outlet VG that cited two lawmakers.  Digitalization Minister Karianne Tung and Minister for Energy Terje Aasland say the law will regulate the data-center industry for the first time, requiring operators of the centers to be registered with local regulators, the report said.

The company has experienced significant growth during the bull market of 2021, but faced challenges in 2022 due to external factors. Despite the setbacks, Coinbase has managed to flesh out the business and continues to evolve under management's vision. The upside is potentially huge, but it's also a steep climb that depends on outside forces working out well. Given this, investors should be picky on their entry price. I have recently covered other investments in the crypto space, one of them being Bitwise's ETF ( BITQ ). While I was generally pessimistic about the fund and its constituent companies, I had a better summary of Coinbase ( COIN ): Coinbase Global, Inc. strikes me as probably the best business of the bunch. It is a crypto exchange, and it's not exclusive to BTC transactions. It enjoys high cash flow from operations most years, with outflow from capex. I did think, however, that COIN was worth its own analysis, particularly as we can see it's performed quite well over the past year. COIN 1Y Price History (Seeking Alpha) While a lot of talk lately around crypto has been in relation to the upcoming halving, I'm going to focus more on the long-term here and explain why I think COIN is just a Hold for now. Brief History Founded in 2012 and with its IPO in 2020, we have a few years of operating history to see how Coinbase has evolved in its role as a crypto exchange (and adjacent services). Author's display of 10K data While much smaller just a few years ago, the bull market of 2021 brought a windfall of activity to the company. We can also see just how sharply this changed once 2022's changes (War in Ukraine, rate hikes) took hold. Still, it's ahead of where it was pre-2021. Author's display of 10K data Expressed as free cash flow, the impact to the bottom line is clearer. 2022 saw significant cash outflow. Author's display of 10K data Following the IPO, however, we have seen a significant amount of stock-based compensation, comparable to their cash generation and therefore risking the long-term returns. Thus, we need to consider what opportunities management thinks they can unlock, what kind of growth will justify this level of SBC. Initial Valuation Before we go into that, let's consider what the current valuation on the market says about the company, with a market cap of $59.5 billion, that comes to ~$245 per share. I've visualized that valuation below with a Discounted Cash Flow model. Author's Calculation I used $1,125M as baseline FCF because that is the average of the last three years. From there, it's a matter of tweaking inputs until we get a valuation close to the current one on the market. As such, we can say that the market is valuing COIN for FCF growth ranging from 17% to 20% over the next decade and still priced for some growth on its terminal multiple toward the end of that period. So this is an optimistic valuation. We need to consider what has informed the market's opinion. Much of this is due to a rally after Q4 2023 results were announced. Rally Since Q4 2023 Earnings (Seeking Alpha) Management's Vision During Q4 2023 earnings , CEO Brian Armstrong relayed the following about the three phases for crypto: I've always said that crypto adoption will happen in three phases, and I want to touch on what we did in 2023 to help drive each of those. In Phase one, crypto is a new asset class that people want to trade. Crypto trading has been a major revenue driver for the industry, and Coinbase is the leader in spot trading in the U.S. But in 2018, derivatives trading became the majority of crypto trading volume. Phase Two: The second...it's also powering new financial services. And in 2023, Stablecoin began to be used in Global Payments. We launched the ability to send free instant global payments on USD Coin using base. We are now in the process of integrating this into our products to make payments of first-class experience. And finally: In the third phase and final phase, we believe crypto will also be a new application platform for the Internet. Over time, the Internet has become more and more centralized with big companies. The Internet also didn't start with a native form of money or payments or value built in. So we got credit cards bolted on as an afterthought. And the number of associated issues like fees, fraud, chargebacks, limited ability to send microtransactions or do cross-border commerce and that led to the rise of ad-based business models. Crypto is redecentralizing the Internet with a new set of protocols for money, identity, messaging, social media, content, governance and even voting. The reason I laid this out is because the first two phases, it seems to me, have already happened or are currently happening. We can see it in Coinbase's current operations. Revenues (2023 Form 10K) Above, we can see total revenues. Below, we can see how they are broken down. 2023 Form 10K In essence, the first table (transaction revenue) entails Phase One, and the second (subscriptions/services) entail Phase Two. There was a windfall of cash from the bull market of 2021 for transactions, which was short-lived. Phase Two, meanwhile, has become a growing part of the revenue, particularly the Stablecoin service. So I do believe there's some tailwinds here, some organic evolution of the business that gives it more sources of the cash flow since the IPO. These two phases, as they are currently reflected in the business, are pretty simple ones. The real question is the third one occurring. The move from One to Two is a gentle slope, while Two to Three is a sheer cliff. Armstrong is betting on a paradigm shift of global financial services. In Coinbase's Morgan Stanley conference call in March, Armstrong elaborated his thoughts on what can lead to this: So if you look at a number of emerging markets around the world, people -- especially where people have high inflation, they've started to use dollar-backed stablecoins. And so we made a big effort to get USDC, which is one of the largest stablecoins out there....So we're already starting to see people adopt that in places around the world. And I think like it kind of makes sense. None of us really think it makes sense to pay 2% to Visa every time you swipe your credit card. It's just sending bits of data... I think payments are going to flow to the path of least resistance over time. There is some basis to this then, but it's still a grandiose assumption to think it will take over to the level that he believes. There are some security threats to crypto that aren't quite as severe for fiat currency. Crucially, if we're talking about the USD, this is an asset that's FDIC-insured. Crypto is not. In that same conference call, when asked on what gave Coinbase such a lead in the crypto space, Armstrong explained: Well, the big one is trust. Every few years, there's a run-up in crypto, and we see some companies rush in and they cut corners to try to get big fast. And what we found is that, that doesn't really work. This is regulated financial services. It does take longer to do things in a compliant way, but that's what creates value long term and makes sure that we stand the test of time. Of course, we could say this about Visa ( V ). They, along with companies like PayPal ( PYPL ), were a big part of the growth the Internet, and they did so with a similar reputation built on trust. That might be why people will accept something like a 2% fee, along with the trust that comes with dollar-cash accounts being FDIC-insured. We don't know that the trust game is one they will win or if it will be soon enough that this valuation makes sense. I think this warrants caution about growth assumptions for Coinbase, the company. Debt and Dilution Then there's concerns for shares of COIN, namely about how they could be diluted going forward. 2023 Form 10K There's $1.2 billion in convertible notes. So this will either be a drag on the cash flow (which is barely $1 billion as it is), or it's going to dilute shareholders more. According to their Form 10K (pg. 163), these are convertible at an approximately $370.45 per share, so if price stays in its current range, that may not happen. While this alone wouldn't account for significant dilution, there is also the matter of stock-based compensation that I mentioned before. I showed how much SBC is, but let's take look at how the stock rewards being issued started stepping up in 2023 and the hundreds of millions in taxes paid on equity awards. Cash From Financing Activities (2023 Form 10K) Now, the Senior Notes are due farther into the future, so I am less worried about those, but considering how shaky the crypto markets can be (again, look at 2021's results versus 2022's), one bad year can really spoil things for this company, forcing default or refinancing on unpleasant terms. Debt and dilution are a drag on the per-share return of COIN, whatever else is true of Coinbase as a whole, and I wonder if the market is fully appreciating how little things like this can add up and whittle down a long-term return. Conclusion Out of the crypto-focused investments out there, COIN stands as one of the sounder ones, with some history of positive cash flow and proof of concept. It goes beyond crypto miners in this regard. I believe the current valuation has some grounding in reality, but it's a sunny view of the future, one that assumes a basic level of cash flow and growth, much of which is dependent on the rest of the world doing something that will be good for Coinbase, not the other way around. I don't find $245 particularly disagreeable, but I also don't think there's enough clarity to run with it. Given the volatility of the crypto markets and that's COIN's best case relies on the ambitious Phase Three (along with the ongoing dilution), I don't think $245 presents a margin of safety. Those who got in earlier in the year seemed to be getting good value. In the meantime, I'd prefer to wait for a similar price, and it's a Hold until I see it.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4683780-still-not-sure-on-coinbase?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/25790013.jpeg

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Multiple Hong Kong bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applicants, including China Asset Management, Bosera Capital and others, posted to social-media platform WeChat (Weixin) that they had been approved to list spot bitcoin and ether ETFs. However, these announcements seem to have front-run an official statement from the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), which has not posted a list of approved issuers. Some of the posts have since been deleted. Singapore-based analytics company 10x Research said in a note there is a 100% probability that Hong Kong will not be the last jurisdiction to approve bitcoin ETFs, and more will likely follow. “This will be an additional demand driver for Bitcoin from various countries that could approve Spot ETFs, namely Australia, Japan, Korea, and the UK,” said the firm.  Bitcoin gained on Monday, adding 3% after dropping to as low as $61,300 over the weekend. The weekend’s drop was due to geopolitical tensions, according to some analysts. Matteo Greco, a research analyst at Fineqia, said: “The weekend's price drop was attributed to geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, with market sentiment improving after an announcement regarding a temporary halt in hostilities among the involved nations.” He also noted that the upcoming bitcoin halving, could trigger a short-term “sell the news” reaction before and after the event. An array of altcoins also gained on Monday, with Render (RNDR), a GPU marketplace that lets users contribute computational power to 3D rendering projects and earn tokens in return, jumping 19%. Ondo Finance’s ONDO also gained, climbing 18% over the past 24 hours.  Germany’s largest state-backed lender, Landesbank Baden-Württemberg (LBBW), is set to offer crypto custody services through a partnership with Austrian exchange platform Bitpanda. The two firms have entered into a strategic partnership, which would see LBBW provided with “Investment-as-a-Service” infrastructure to “store and procure cryptocurrencies,” including bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH). ""By offering crypto-asset custody, we are positioning ourselves with a clear added value for our corporate clients – while ensuring the highest security standards,"" Stefanie Münz, member of the LBBW board of directors responsible for finance, strategy and operations, said in a press statement. ""Bitpanda provides the necessary technical and regulatory infrastructure to offer our customers innovative and, above all, secure solutions in the area of digital assets.""  Chart of the Day  The chart shows bitcoin's 2% aggregated market depth, or combined value of buy and sell orders within a 2% price range of the market price, in BTC terms.  The market depth has dropped to 6.76K BTC, the lowest in at least a year.  Weak depth means the market may not absorb large buy/sell orders at stable prices.

42408471,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaJGXm,1713181702,"Meme-Coin, AI Tokens Lead Gains After Bitcoin Drop Causes $2B in Weekend Liquidations","Meme coins and AI-linked tokens experienced significant sectoral gains in the past 24 hours, outperforming major tokens including bitcoin.  Bitcoin and other major tokens began to recover from weekend losses, with BTC trading around $66,600 in European morning hours, buoyed by claims of approval of spot bitcoin and ether ETFs in Hong Kong.  The market-wide decline had been caused by profit-taking ahead of the bitcoin halving and macroeconomic tremors, leading to the liquidation of over $2 billion in futures positions and a drop in open interest as bets were closed.  Meme coins and artificial intelligence (AI)-linked tokens led gains in the past 24 hours as bitcoin and other major tokens started to reverse weekend losses.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} added 3.3% to trade around $66,600 in European morning hours, buoyed by reports prospective ETF providers said they had been approved to offer bitcoin and ether exchange-traded funds in Hong Kong.  Solana meme coins, dog-themed meme coins and Base network meme coins jumped over 15% on average, CoinGecko category data shows, while AI tokens zoomed over 17%. There was no apparent catalyst for the jumps.  Tokens of layer-1 blockchains, such as ether {{ETH}}, Solana’s SOL and Avalanche’s AVAX, were among the worst-performing categories, with an average rise of 5.5%. The broad-based CoinDesk 20, a liquid index of major tokens, minus stablecoins, rose nearly 6%.  On-chain analysis tool Lookonchain said in an X post that whales, a colloquial term for wealthy traders whose actions can move token prices, picked up millions of dollars worth of meme tokens cat in a dogs world (MEW) and slerf (SLERF). Prices for the two rose almost 80% in the past 24 hours.  Profit taking ahead of the halving, due later this week, and macroeconomic tremors weighed on the market since late Friday, with bitcoin dropping from last week’s highs around $70,500 to as low as $62,800. That caused a market-wide decline as majors dropped as much as 18%.  As a result, $2 billion in futures positions were liquidated over the weekend, the most since March. Over $1.5 billion of those positions were betting on higher prices, data from analysis tool Coinalyze shows.  A Coinalyze representative told CoinDesk in an X message that the leverage flush caused open interest – or the number of unsettled futures contracts – to drop $13 billion since Friday, indicative of bets being closed.  Some traders said the price fall was expected ahead of the halving, a much-anticipated event on April 20 that will cut the rewards offered to network miners by half.  “While previous halving events have historically been followed by 9-12 months of uptrend, they have often triggered short-term 'sell the news' reactions before and after the event,” Matteo Greco, a research analyst at digital asset investment firm Fineqia International, told CoinDesk in an email.  “This short-term bearish sentiment is also reflected in the net outflow of $85 million from Bitcoin Spot ETFs during the week, signaling increased profit-taking and investor caution following the strong uptrend in both Q4 2023 and Q1 2024,” Greco added, referring to bitcoin ETF products in the U.S.",POSITIVE,BTC | SOL,ASIA | BTC | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/15/meme-coin-ai-tokens-lead-gains-after-bitcoin-drop-causes-2b-in-weekend-liquidations,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1c58fc7f56689a9fb13c417b5b99c732750052c6-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

25786816,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=603267,1713179165,Shiba Inu Insider Reveals Top 5 Shibarium Investment Rules,"In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Lucie, the marketing lead for Shiba Inu, has provided potential investors with a new set of guidelines for evaluating projects within the Shibarium ecosystem, a dedicated layer-2 blockchain aimed at enhancing the Shiba Inu network. This guidance focuses on critical factors that reflect a project’s contribution to the ecosystem’s growth and sustainability. Five Investment Rules For Shibarium Projects 1. SHIB Token Burn: Lucie emphasized the importance of SHIB token burning as a primary metric. Token burning, or permanently removing tokens from circulation, is a strategy used to induce scarcity and potentially enhance the token’s value over time. Lucie assesses the impact of SHIB burns on the ecosystem’s overall health and price stability. 2. Metaverse Development: The second rule focuses on whether projects are planning or currently building within the Shiba Inu Metaverse. As SHIB: The Metaverse represents a burgeoning area for development, investments in this space could signal forward-thinking and innovative capabilities within the Shibarium projects. 3. Engagement with BONE Token: BONE ShibaSwap (BONE), serves as the gas token for transactions within Shibarium. Lucie queries whether a project is involved in burning BONE or creating utilities around it that increase its appeal and functional use within the ecosystem. This utility can significantly impact the token’s demand and usage patterns. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Sell Pressure Is Dropping – Here’s What It Means For Price 4. LEASH Token Utilization: Another crucial factor is the use of Doge Killer (LEASH), another significant token in the ecosystem. Projects’ plans for incorporating LEASH into their functionalities or governance structures reflect their integration depth within the Shibarium network. 5. Verified Contributions to Shibarium: The final criterion involves assessing the tangible, positive contributions a project has made towards improving Shibarium, with a necessity for these contributions to be verifiable on the blockchain. This transparency ensures that the projects not only promise but also deliver real value to the ecosystem. Examples Of Shiba Inu Projects Meeting Lucie’s Criteria Lucie named several projects that exemplify her investment rules. WoofSwap, for example, has been a proactive participant in SHIB and BONE burning through its inscription tokens and the launch of its meme coin, DAMN. This activity helps reduce the circulation of key tokens, potentially driving up their value. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Shiba Inu Price Will Reach $0.0001 If This Happens Shib Dream and Shib CoOp were cited for their contributions to building within the Shiba Inu Metaverse, a significant area of development that could herald new utility and user engagement within the ecosystem. K9 Finance has been noted for enhancing liquidity and staking mechanisms for BONE, creating more robust economic incentives and utility for the token. In terms of blockchain-verifiable contributions, projects like LumiBots, Mantra Protocol, NestX, and Shib CoOp assist in NFT adoption on Shibarium, facilitating a broader use case for digital assets within the ecosystem. DEX MARSWAP was highlighted for its role in facilitating Shiboshis staking and supporting new projects within the ecosystem. Shib Dream responded enthusiastically to Lucie’s endorsement: “All great projects! We have burned over a Billion Shib. Invested over 30K in Shibarium Projects. Building in the Metaverse. Gave back over $60K to the community. Good Deeds – Over $10k in Donations. Not using Leash yet going to figure that out. Other things coming soon. SHIBARIUM. Keep Building. Keep Dreaming.” At press time, SHIB traded at $0.00002360.

The Conservative-party-led government has said it wants to make the U.K. a global hub for crypto and passed legislation last year to recognize crypto and stablecoins as regulated financial activities in the country.  The U.K. government is set to put forward legislation for stablecoins as well as for crypto staking, exchange and custody by June or July, Economic Secretary Bim Afolami said at the Innovate Finance Global Summit on Monday.  ""We are now working at pace to deliver the legislation to put our final proposals for our regime in place,"" Afolami said. ""Once it goes live, a whole host of crypto asset activities, including operating an exchange, taking custody of customers’ assets and other things, will come within the regulatory perimeter for the first time.""  In 2023, the U.K. passed a landmark financial markets bill that laid the foundation for stablecoins and crypto broadly to be treated as regulated financial activities in the country. Local regulators, the Financial Conduct Authority and the Bank of England, both consulted on what a stablecoin regime would look like last February. The BoE said it would oversee stablecoin providers that were large enough to affect the financial system, while the FCA said it would regulate the wider crypto space.  Afolami teased the coming of secondary stablecoin legislation in February, adding that the government was pushing to get it done within six months.  The U.K.’s Conservative Party-led government has said it wanted to be a crypto huband has since consulted on its ambitions to regulate crypto. The U.K. is expected to have an election this year, which could see the Conservative party ousted and some crypto plans left in limbo, meaning the party could have a limited time left to execute its plans. The Labour party is the current favorite to win.

Congestion issues plagued the network in recent months amid a meme coin frenzy, causing a bump in user activity and significantly high demand for the network.  Solana developers said a new software update to tackle the congestion problem on the popular blockchain is “now recommended” for general use by mainnet validators, as per an X post.  “The v1.17.31 release is now recommended for general use by MainnetBeta validators,” they said. “This release contains enhancements which will help alleviate the ongoing congestion on the Solana Network.”  Version 1.17.31 is the first in a series of planned updates to address network congestion in recent months, Rex St John, head of developer relations at Anza, which rolled out Monday’s update, said in an X post.  Validators are entities that run nodes or software that confirms transactions and secures any blockchain network. These entities need to continually upgrade their node to newer releases to deal with any issues that may arise when a network is running.  Congestion issues plagued the network in recent months amid a meme coin frenzy, causing a bump in user activity and significantly high demand for the network. Transactional volumes reached as much as $4 billion in March from the usual figures of under $500 million per day in 2023.  The high use of bots caused a spike in “failed” transactions on the network, Solana developer @0xMert_ previously explained on X.  A fail, in this context, meant a smart contract flagged certain transactions as a “bad request,” even as they were successfully submitted to the Solana network.  Broadly speaking, the final version prioritizes transactions from “good” validators, or those with a sizeable stake, to a node leader, where transactions are ultimately confirmed. Such a priority would allow validators with a higher stake to receive higher quality of service – preventing lower-quality validators from maliciously flooding the network with transactions.  Version 1.18 is currently being run on a testnet or a network that mimics the main blockchain to test for bugs and other issues.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | SOL | TECHNOLOGY | ZRX,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/04/15/solana-rolls-out-update-to-tackle-network-congestion,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/00389ee29018d918edc645c16ea2a5ee840dd1e2-4666x2624.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

These approvals were granted to prominent asset managers including China Asset Management, Bosera Capital, and HashKey Capital Limited, alongside an in-principle approval for Harvest Global Investments. Hong Kong’s SFC Approves Bitcoin And ETH ETFs China Asset Management’s Hong Kong unit, as detailed in their press release, has received SFC approval to launch spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. This initiative is part of a collaboration with OSL Digital Securities Limited and BOCI International, aiming to provide retail asset management services with direct cryptocurrency subscriptions. Similarly, Bosera Asset Management and HashKey Capital have announced that they have received conditional approval from the SFC for their own spot crypto ETFs. These products, named the Bosera HashKey Bitcoin ETF and the Bosera HashKey Ether ETF, will allow investors to directly use Bitcoin and Ethereum to subscribe for ETF shares, as stated in their press release. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $100,000: Can Hong Kong’s Spot ETFs Make It Happen? Harvest Global Investments has also been spotlighted with the SFC’s in-principle nod for two major digital asset spot ETFs. According to their press release, Mr. Tongli Han, CEO and CIO of Harvest Global Investments, remarked, “This in-principle approval for Harvest Global Investments’ products in two major digital asset spot ETFs not only underscores Hong Kong’s competitive edge in the digital asset space, but also demonstrates our unrelenting pursuit of promoting innovation in the industry and meeting diversified investor needs.” These ETFs are set to be launched through a partnership with OSL Digital Securities, the first digital asset platform licensed and insured by the SFC, highlighting a significant stride in addressing common market challenges such as excessive margin requirements and price premiums. Related Reading: Bitcoin Stays Sub $70,000 As Hong Kong Readies April-End ETF Launch The press release from Bosera and HashKey highlights that the introduction of these virtual asset spot ETFs will not only provide new asset allocation opportunities but also reinforce Hong Kong’s status as an international financial center and a hub for virtual assets. This move is aligned with the city’s strategic push to establish itself as a regional leader in financial innovation, particularly in the digital asset sector. The approvals are indicative of Hong Kong’s progressive regulatory framework which aims to integrate digital assets within its financial ecosystem safely and securely. The establishment of these ETFs is expected to provide a regulated, innovative investment avenue for both retail and institutional investors in the region. While there is not as much hype as there is around US ETFs, some analysts believe the impact could be similar. These approvals come on the heels of rumors last Friday about the potential approval of these ETFs. The market had been abuzz with speculations, and today’s confirmation has provided the Bitcoin and ETH prices with a much needed boost. BTC is up 2.2% since the announcement, surpassing the $66,000 mark. The approved ETFs are reportedly set to launch by the end of April. At press time, BTC traded at $66,535.

42408481,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaJH1X,1713164400,Bitcoin Halving Has Crypto Miners Racing for 'Epic Sat' Potentially Worth Millions,"This is the first bitcoin rewards halving in which value can be assigned to individual sats, which can now be traded like NFTs following last year's launch of the Ordinals protocol.  The first sat to be mined after this month's halving could theoretically attain a value of $1 million or more on marketplaces for digital collectibles.  ""It's kind of a lottery ticket,"" said an executive of the crypto mining firm Marathon Digital.  With Bitcoin's fourth quadrennial ""halving"" now as little as a week away, cryptocurrency mining companies are jockeying to capture what could be the most valuable data block of all time, worth millions of dollars potentially.  Almost two years ago, Casey Rodarmor, creator of the Ordinals protocol atop the Bitcoin blockchain, developed a system for categorizing the rarity of individual satoshis, or ""sats"" – the smallest denomination of the digital asset, similar to cents on the dollar or pence on the pound.  This feature is part of CoinDesk's ""Future of Bitcoin,"" package published to coincide with the Halving in April 2024.  The reason for the system was because, following the launch of Ordinals in early 2023, these satoshis could be numbered and traded as if they were unique tokens. But each one could also be thought of as collectibles, or a non-fungible token (NFT). And as any collector knows, the price of a collector's item is often linked to its rarity.  Rodarmor's scale went from ""uncommon,"" the first sat of each block, all the way up to ""mythic,"" which is the first sat of the first-ever block on Bitcoin — presumably lodged safely in Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto's possession. So don't even think about obtaining that.  Somewhere in between, but on the higher end of the scale, ranks the first sat after a Bitcoin rewards halving — the start of a new ""epoch,"" in the blockchain jargon. It is classed as ""epic."" Tristan, the founder of Ordiscan, thinks this sat could be ""conservatively"" valued at $50 million by prospective Ordinals enthusiasts.  See also: The Bitcoin Halving Really Is Different This Time  So what's happening now is the first-ever race for an epic sat since Ordinals was introduced, prior Bitcoin halvings were much more ho-hum, because there was little more than bragging rights at stake for crypto miners. And bets are on that this first-ever epic sat could be valued very highly on Ordinals marketplaces.  ""So if we take that satoshi that is produced in an event that happens every two weeks, to a sat that's produced just once every four years, I don't know what that's going to be worth, but it could be millions,"" Adam Swick, chief growth officer of mining firm Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA), said in an interview.  The race for the 'epic' sat  Mining companies making a concerted effort to win this race could ramp up their operations to ensure they account for a high a percentage of the global hashrate — the total computing power working to confirm Bitcoin transactions — right at the point it becomes clear the halving is imminent.  Just as the miners responded to BTC's surge to new all-time highs last month in order to cash in on the higher prices, they might run flat-out to maximize their chances of catching the first block after the halving.  This might involve bringing new, more powerful equipment online and even reinstalling older and soon-to-be-obsolete kit.  The halving, the fourth in Bitcoin's 15-year history, is programmed to occur when the network reaches block height 840,000, sometime next week; it's looking like April 19 or 20.  The miner who adds that block to the blockchain rewarded with 3.125 BTC, about $219,000. It's not chump change, but it's a step change down from the 6.25 BTC, or $440,000 prior to the halving  But such calculations also show what's at stake if a single satoshi, which is one-hundred-millionth of 1 BTC, might be worth more than $1 million.  This miner would then need to send 546 satoshis – the minimum amount able to be sent over the blockchain in a transaction, also known as the ""dust limit"" – to a cold storage wallet. The first of the sats contained in this unspent transaction output (UXTO) would be retroactively labeled as the first sat post-halving, since the Ordinals protocol defines sats on a first-in-first-out basis.  ""They'd essentially break the 3.125 BTC into two: one of which is incredibly small and has the first sat in it, the rest is just bitcoin and doesn't have anything special about it,"" Tyler Whittle, of Ordinals project Taproot Wizards, said in an interview.  What would the first sat after the halving be worth?  Tristan, founder of Ordinals project tracker Ordiscan.com, wrote in a blog post that under the “Rodarmor Rarity” system, the first sat in the block alone could be worth at least $1 million.  Miners have now had a year or so of experience, since Ordinals was launched, to cash in on the full value of their bitcoin rewards, including any especially valuable sats that are buried within.  ""We have thousands of these uncommon sats – the first satoshi of every block for example – and we've often looked at the market to see if we should sell them or hold them,"" Marathon Digital's Swick said..  Marathon has also mined the first sat after a difficulty adjustment, which at one point ""was worth hundreds of thousands of dollars,"" according to Swick.  Another publicly-listed mining firm, Hut 8 (HUT), has been scouring its balance sheet for rare sats that it may already own and monitoring what interest there may be in the market, its CEO told CoinDesk.  Asher Genoot compares the concept to demand for ""virgin"" bitcoin – BTC that has never been transacted.  ""When we first started mining, people were saying that they would pay a premium for virgin bitcoin, but it's not a very liquid market, so there's not a very clear price,"" he said.  How much effort are miners putting into mining the rare first sat after the halving?  The major miners, those that command a relatively significant percentage of global hashrate, may feel they have the resources to actively chase that first epic sat to be mined in the Ordinals era.  Marathon, for example, has around a 5% share, therefore could be said to have a 5% of winning it.  ""We recognize that it's kind of a lottery ticket,"" Swick said. ""But we're being careful to make sure all our machines are online, which is our goal anyway. But it's something we're acutely aware of coming up to the halving.""  Some comparatively smaller firms might recognize that the structure of their operations make the trophy far too unrealistic. Marathon, for example, operates its own mining pool, but many other firms do not.  Thomas Chippas, CEO of Argo Blockchain (ARGO), believes that miners can only realistically chase it if they are in Marathon's position. Most miners are members of a pool and some pools will often drop the top two or three blocks and the bottom two or three blocks over a period of time when they commence their calculation of the payout to miners, Chippas explained in an interview with CoinDesk.  ""They do that as a way to avoid both positive and negative outliers,"" Chippas said. ""So in a pool like that, if there's some crazy block because someone paid up for a particular sat, you might not benefit from it because that pool might drop that block.""  ""So, we are interested in that revenue that a rare sat could bring, but we're also very practical,"" he said.  What interest is there outside of mining firms?  Swick imagined a use case for a futures market to develop around the mining of rare and epic sats, whereby miners with substantial hashrate share are paid up front for rare sats they could theoretically obtain.  Read More: Ordinals Defy Bitcoin's Design Principles but Offer Miners Huge Post-Halving Advantages  Marathon's 5% global hashrate, for example, could lead an Ordinals trader to pay the company 5% of what they think the epic sat will be worth. So, if the first post-halving sat could fetch $100 million, the trader pays Marathon $5 million with the promise that the firm hands over the epic sat if their pool does win it.  ""It could be super interesting if someone runs round to all the publicly-listed mining firms pre-paying them for the epic sat, and then they have almost a 25% chance of winning it as these companies make up about 22.8% of total hash rate"" Swick said.  ""This has never been done before and I'm frankly fascinated that a futures market like this has not emerged yet,"" he added.  UPDATE (16:45 UTC): Changes Swick's quote on mining firms' total hash rate percentage from 40% to ~22.8%.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Jamie Crawley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2024/04/15/bitcoin-halving-has-crypto-miners-racing-for-epic-sat-potentially-worth-millions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e48f669aa6bc54741971f000e4b08cf8af28d2c2-3840x2160.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Still, the market for meme coins appears more liquid than early this year, a sign meme coins are more than a passing trend.  The meme coin frenzy may have slightly subsided with bitcoin {{BTC}}, the industry leader, losing upside momentum. Still, markets for top meme coins remain more liquid than early this year, a sign that the supposedly nonserious cryptocurrencies, which are often criticized for lacking utility, are here to stay.  Over the past week, top meme coins like DOGE, SHIB, WIF, PEPE, FLOKI, and BONK have dropped in value, ranging from 19% to 27%, registering bigger losses than bitcoin, CoinDesk data show. The leading cryptocurrency by market value has declined 6% as escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East have spurred an outflow of money from risk assets and into safe havens like gold.  The price pullbacks have led to a decline in trading volumes. According to data tracked by institutional crypto exchange FalconX, the average daily trading volume in the leading meme coins has cooled to $3 billion from $5.8 billion in March. However, it remains significantly higher than $500 million daily in January.  More importantly, the 1% market depth, a measure of liquidity to gauge how easy it is to execute large orders at stable prices, remains resilient.  Per FalconX, the 1% market depth for DOGE, the world’s biggest meme coin by market value, was $10 million on Friday, the highest in at least a year. Meanwhile, the market depth for the second largest meme token, SHIB, was $4 million.  In other words, buy/sell orders worth $10 million and $4 million are needed to move the price of DOGE and SHIB, respectively, by 1%. The 1% market depth represents a collection of buy and sell offers within 1% of the mid-price or the average of the bid and ask prices.  “These levels are very respectable for alts [altcoins] liquidity. For reference, SOL has a market depth of roughly $20 million. Such increases [in] volumes coupled with market depth are not that common and have traditionally happened to assets believed to have staying power, such as SOL recently,” FalconX said in the weekly newsletter.  “All in, if the price and volume trends show a tired market in the short term, market depth is showing that meme coins could have more staying power than some expect,” FalconX added.",POSITIVE,BTC | DOGE | SHIB,BTC | DOGE | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/15/sticky-liquidity-in-doge-and-shib-suggests-meme-tokens-have-staying-power,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5bca133f87cfa7981e7a3c3b1007cef1d5bcfdff-1273x716.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

While all eyes are naturally on Bitcoin itself, XRP, Ripple’s native token, has emerged as a surprising source of intrigue. Historical price movements, recent legal developments, and a range of expert predictions are fueling a sense of cautious optimism for XRP’s future. Related Reading: Dogwifhat To The Vet! Meme Coin Needs Medical Attention After Price Plunge — Analyst XRP And The Halving Halo Effect Historically, altcoins like XRP have often mirrored Bitcoin’s price movements. Following significant events in the Bitcoin market, particularly halving events that cut the mining reward in half, altcoins have frequently experienced surges in value. This has led some analysts to believe that it could be poised for a similar rise in the wake of the upcoming halving. However, the narrative surrounding XRP has been complicated by the ongoing legal battle between Ripple Labs and the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC alleges that the altcoin is an unregistered security, a classification that has cast a shadow over the token’s legitimacy and dampened investor enthusiasm. Legal Clarity Buoys Sentiment A recent development in the lawsuit has injected a dose of optimism into the XRP market. In July 2023, a judge issued a ruling declaring XRP as a non-security. This long-awaited legal clarity has provided much-needed regulatory certainty for XRP, boosting confidence among investors who now view its potential with renewed faith. XRP market cap currently at $28 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Expert Opinions Offer A Range Of XRP Price Predictions As the halving draws closer, prominent market analysts have weighed in on XRP’s potential price trajectory. Predictions vary considerably, reflecting the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market. Leb, a respected analyst with a strong track record, believes XRP could reach its previous all-time high of $3.84 either before or immediately after the halving. This bullish prediction highlights the potential for significant gains. XRP price action in the last 24 hours. Source Looking towards the longer term, analyst Jake Gagain presents a more conservative yet optimistic outlook. He predicts XRP could reach $5.85 by 2025. This aligns with the views of Dark Defender, another analyst who anticipates a steady upward trend for XRP in the coming years. While some investors find these long-term projections overly ambitious, others believe they are achievable given the evolving regulatory landscape and XRP’s underlying utility as a cross-border payment solution.
