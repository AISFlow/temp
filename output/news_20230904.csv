17095879,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=549962,1693868445,Why The Shiba Inu Price Cannot Realistically Get To $0.001,"In the last crypto bull market spanning from 2020-2021, the price of Shiba Inu ran as high as $0.00008. Due to the high euphoria at the time, expectations rose rapidly around the meme coin, leading to calls for SHIB at $0.001. However, this target remains as unrealistic today as it was back then and this report dives into the reason why. Not Enough Of SHIB Supply Is Being Burned The Shiba Inu community officially kicked off its burning initiative back in 2022 which SHIB tokens being sent to dead addresses weekly. However, despite being roughly a year in the making, the total number of SHIB tokens burned so far has been next to negligible in the grand scheme of things. Related Reading: Expert Market Analysts Agree A Spot Bitcoin ETF Is A Matter Of When, Not If Shibburn, a Shiba Inu burn tracking website, shows that a total of 410,658,326,324,061 tokens have been burned since the first burn. This accounts for a little over 46% of the maximum total supply of more than 999 trillion tokens. But even more interesting is the fact that the community burn makes up less than 1% of the total burned figure. Community burn accounts for less than 0.5% of total burn figure | Source: Shibburn The vast majority of the burned figure mentioned above comes from the burn carried out by Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin. The Shiba Inu founders had sent half of the token’s supply to Buterin, who then donated 50 billion SHIB to an Indian COVID relief fund and sent the rest to a burn address. Buterin’s transaction carried over 410 trillion tokens and was the first-ever recorded SHIB burn event. Given that the SHIB burned so far is sitting at 410,658,326,324,061, it means the community burn over the last year makes up around 0.15% of the total burned tokens. SHIB price stalls below $0.000008 | Source: SHIBUSD on Tradingview.com Can’t Drive Shiba Inu To $0.001 The point of the Shiba Inu community burn was to encourage the rapid reduction of the SHIB supply. With the supply of the token so high, it has served as a hindrance for it to reach higher prices compared to its fiercest rival Dogecoin. The community burn is not removing tokens from circulation as fast as is needed, stalling the potential of SHIB’s price hitting $0.001. Realistically, for SHIB to rise as high as $0.001, at least 80% of its supply would have to be burned to make this an attainable goal. This means removing hundreds of trillions of tokens from circulation just like Buterin did with his burn. Related Reading: Pro-XRP Legal Expert Takes The Spotlight With Daring Ripple Vs SEC Settlement Theory However, given that most of the remaining SHIB supply is already in circulation, meaning in the hands of millions of holders, such a large burn is impossible. This is because investors would not want to burn large chunks of their holdings, which is the same as throwing dollar bills in an open flame. Unfortunately, this means the price of the meme coin will likely not reach $0.001 given that its current circulating supply sits at over 579 trillion, even more than the portion of supply already burned.

On-chain data on September 4 shows that one Ethereum holder sold 694 ETH, worth roughly $1.13 million when writing, for 1,010 MKR. At the time of the swap, MKR was changing hands at $1,122. Whale Swaps ETH For MKR As of September 4, the address, “0x3737,” had over $20.37 million worth of assets. While the whale trades against Vitalik and doubles down on MKR, zooming in on the address’s portfolio shows that the largest holding is ETH. The address holds 10,000 ETH worth $16.3 million at spot rates, representing over 75% of the total portfolio. Meanwhile, some of his other major holdings include Arbitrum (ARB), worth $2.9 million, and MKR, worth $1.1 million. Related Reading: XRP Summer Showdown: Trading Hype Versus Price Reality, What Lies Ahead? MKR, the token issued by MakerDAO, the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that controls the minting of DAI, a stablecoin on Ethereum, has been ripping higher in the last few months. MKR plays a key role in stabilizing DAO and is used as a last resort. Holders participate in governance, voting on proposals that best stabilize the algorithmic stablecoin, deciding collateral types accepted, stability fee adjustments, and others. From June, MKR has more than doubled, rising 125% to peak at around $1,300 in early August. It is now trading at over $1,100, up 13% from August lows. Maker Presents Endgame The token’s surge has been attributed to multiple factors, specifically the release of the “Endgame” roadmap. Under this plan, MakerDAO plans to, among other things, release their blockchain, rebrand, and introduce two more tokens. This move is significant because MakerDAO is among the first decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. According to DeFiLlama data, the protocol has a total value locked (TVL) of over $5 billion. It is the largest decentralized money market in the world. Meanwhile, DAI, its algorithmic yield-earning stablecoin, has been stable recently and is the largest in Ethereum. At press time, DAI had a market cap of $5.3 billion, perched at 12th on the leaderboard. At this pace, DAI is the third-largest stablecoin after USDT and USDC.

17090042,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=549988,1693861247,Bitcoin’s Spot ETF: Will BTC Mimic Gold’s 2004 Price Surge? Analyst Weighs In,"A fresh perspective on Bitcoin has recently surfaced courtesy of prominent crypto enthusiast and YouTuber Lark Davis. Davis offers an interesting parallel between Bitcoin’s potential fate and gold’s historical performance, especially spotlighting the transformative year of 2004 for the latter. Reflecting on gold’s journey in the early 2000s, a period marked by the introduction of a gold Exchange Traded Fund (ETF), Lark Davis suggests that Bitcoin may be on the brink of a similar breakout. While this is a bold claim, its rationale, centered on the anticipated launch of a Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF), warrants a closer look. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchanges See Three Straight Months Of Withdrawals For First Time Ever Gold’s 2004 Surge: A Prelude To Bitcoin’s Future? 2004 was transformative for gold, with its price trajectory reflecting a notable paradigm shift. The catalyst for this change was the launch of the first gold ETF – SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) by State Street Corporation. A chart shared by Davis vividly encapsulates this: the price of gold began its ascent from a modest $400 per ounce towards the end of 2004 and reached a pinnacle of $1,939 by 2011. Although a decline to $1,184 followed this meteoric rise, the overall trend showcased the profound impact of ETFs on asset prices. If history were to serve as a guide, Davis’s analogy suggests Bitcoin might follow a similar path. A potential Bitcoin spot ETF could usher in a flurry of new investments, changing the market’s supply and demand dynamics. As Davis showed from the gold example, introducing such an ETF for Bitcoin could potentially attract between $20 billion and $30 billion. Assuming today’s prices, this would be equivalent to newcomers snapping up approximately half of the available Bitcoin on exchanges. Estimates are that a spot Bitcoin ETF would bring 20-30 billion of fresh cash into Bitcoin. That would buy about half of all coins on exchanges at current prices. For reference here is what happened to gold when it got its first ETF approved on US markets. History repeating? pic.twitter.com/CBNvZgMq18 — Lark Davis (@TheCryptoLark) September 4, 2023 ‘Supply And Demand Don’t Lie’ While Davis’s projection is rooted in past trends, it’s crucial to understand the broader dynamics at play. His assertion that “supply and demand don’t lie” underlines the fundamental economic principle that when demand exceeds supply, prices generally rise. The launch of a Bitcoin ETF would invariably boost demand by offering a more accessible and regulated way for investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without owning the underlying asset directly. This surge in demand and Bitcoin’s capped supply might push prices higher, just as it did for gold in 2004. However, as with all financial forecasts, there’s a degree of speculation involved. While the parallel between gold’s 2004 trajectory and Bitcoin’s potential future is compelling, only time will reveal the actual course of events.

17085727,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=549985,1693855803,"XRP Summer Showdown: Trading Hype Versus Price Reality, What Lies Ahead?","XRP, the fifth-largest cryptocurrency in the market, has entered a phase of macro consolidation following a significant decline that began on July 20. This consolidation has maintained the token’s price within a range of $0.4858 and $0.5505, before Ripple Labs’ legal victory against the US Securities and Exchange Commission on July 13. XRP Consolidation Continues Despite Strong Trading Activity According to insights from crypto market data provider Kaiko, XRP demonstrated extreme trade volume during the summer. XRP’s average trade volume in the previous month reached $462 million, four times higher than the following most prominent altcoins by trade volume. The question arises as to why XRP failed to sustain its price gains despite its impressive trade volume. Analyzing the average share of sell volume for XRP provides some insights. Notably, the largest Korean exchange, Upbit, and OKX experienced significant selling pressure, while buying activity was more prominent on US-based Coinbase throughout the previous month. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Whales Begin Accumulation As Shibarium Grows Another interesting observation is the rise in average trade size for XRP on Coinbase, surpassing all other top ten altcoins. This suggests that buying demand may have been driven by large traders in the United States, as investors regained access to the token following the July court ruling. However, it is essential to note that even though XRP tops the list on offshore markets, its share of trading volume in the United States remains lower, ranking it as the sixth most traded altcoin by cumulative trade volume. Currently, XRP is trading at $0.5063, displaying a stable price within 24 hours. Moreover, the token has maintained a consistent consolidation phase, experiencing a slight decrease of 2.7% and 1.4% over the past seven and fourteen days, respectively. This raises whether XRP’s uptrend will prevail or if further downside movements are looming. Is A Bullish Resurgence Or Downtrend Imminent? Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto recently took to the social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) to present two contrasting scenarios for XRP’s price movement. The first scenario suggested a potential dip to $0.43 or even $0.35, which could be seen as a shakeout before a rebound. The second scenario proposed a more optimistic outlook, with XRP potentially aiming for heights of $0.60 and $0.67 before skyrocketing to new levels. To gain further insights into the likelihood of these scenarios, it is crucial to examine XRP’s resistance and support lines on the daily chart above. The chart reveals that while surpassing the next resistance level of $0.5401 and regaining bullish momentum, XRP could potentially experience a substantial 27% uptrend toward $0.6700, as predicted by Egrag Crypto. However, the token currently faces two significant hurdles in achieving this. XRP’s 200-day and 50-day Moving Averages (MAs) can act as solid resistance levels if the token’s trading volume is not accompanied by sufficient buying pressure. Presently, XRP is trading below these two lines, which adds to the challenge of surpassing the resistance. If XRP fails to overcome these resistances and sustain its consolidation phase, another correction may soon be on the horizon for the token.

If this level is breached, the token could decline further to the $0.3495 zone or even the $0.2854 line, representing XRP’s one-year support. Considering the various scenarios and the resistance and support lines depicted in the chart, the absence of catalysts that could propel XRP to higher price territories, coupled with a failed attempt to maintain its macro consolidation zone, may lead XRP towards continuing its downtrend and potentially reaching a new yearly low.

17081932,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=549976,1693850681,Hottest New Meme Crypto ‘Sonik Coin’ Nears $1.5 Million Raised With 20 Hours Left In Presale,"The speedy new meme coin Sonik Coin (SONIK) has exploded past $1.35 million in its presale after launching less than three weeks ago. Now, investors are poised with just 20 hours remaining to buy $SONIK at its presale price or face buying it on the open market after its initial exchange offering (IEO). With little time remaining, investors have begun piling into the presale at sonikcoin.com, opening the door to a possible sell-out due to its $2,098,547 hard cap. The project will be listed on Uniswap, with rumors circulating it could go live as early as next week. One of the main reasons for Sonik Coin’s successful presale is its unique Stake-to-Earn mechanism offering holders passive rewards with a generous annual percentage yield (APY) on their $SONIK tokens. What Is Sonik Coin? Sonik Coin is a newly launched meme coin inspired by the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise. The project has no official affiliation to the franchise but simply pays homage to it, establishing a nostalgic allure. According to its website, Sonik Coin aims to be the fastest meme coin to reach a $100 million market cap. Considering the giants that stand before it, like Pepe and Shiba Inu, this is no easy task. However, Sonik Coin’s growing presale success signifies a thriving and engaged community, which will likely carry over following its IEO. Visit the Sonik Coin Telegram channel to stay updated on the project’s latest announcements. Stake-to-Earn Sonik Coin’s premier feature is its Stake-to-Earn mechanism, offering holders passive rewards by simply staking tokens in the project’s smart contract. When writing this, the project offers an impressive 56% APY on staked tokens. Furthermore, the Sonik Coin staking dashboard shows that over 42,000,000 $SONIK are staked, almost 25% of its current circulating supply. As the amount of $SONIK tokens staked increases, the APY will drop. However, the project has a four-year vesting schedule to ensure its long-term health. Also, more tokens in the staking pool will add to the token’s scarcity, potentially benefitting its price. Stake-to-Earn has proved a hot topic lately, with the popular Stake-to-Earn BTC20 doing a 6x following its presale. Analysts Forecast 100x Gains As well as catching the eye of meme coin investors, Sonik Coin has been touted by many prominent industry analysts. According to YouTube analyst and trader Michael Wrubel (300K subscribers), Sonik Coin could do a 100x following its presale. The video highlights that Sonik Coin is well-positioned to pump due to the ongoing broader market conditions. Another popular analyst, Jacob Bury (21K subscribers), predicts a 10x for Sonik Coin, calling it a Pepe alternative and highlighting its Stake-to-Earn feature as its main draw. Meanwhile, Crypto Gains (107K subscribers) estimates a 20x for the meme coin. The analysis compared Sonik Coin to HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu, which recently exploded to a $140 million market cap a couple of months after launching. Community-Focused Tokenomics The final piece to the Sonik Coin project is its long-term, community-centric tokenomics. It has a total supply of 299,792,458,000 (incidentally the speed of light), with 50% of tokens available in the presale, 40% allocated to staking, and 10% for liquidity to enable seamless trading. Sonik Coin’s entire presale has taken place at a single price of $0.000014, providing all investors an equal opportunity to buy $SONIK and encouraging community solidarity. Finally, 0xGuard conducted a Sonik Coin audit to test the project’s security. Ultimately, the auditor reported that Sonik Coin is safe due to no malicious findings. With just 21 hours until the presale ends, potential investors must be quick to secure their $SONIK tokens. Alternatively, you can buy them on the open market after its Uniswap exchange launch, but at a potentially higher price.

These whales have been making large transfers carrying trillions of SHIB tokens worth tens of millions of dollars. This heightened activity, while interesting on its own, is also leading to positive sentiment around them due to their destinations. Shiba Inu Whales Moving Away From Centralized Exchanges A number of large Shiba Inu transactions were highlighted by the popular whale tracking account on X (formerly Twitter) called Whale Alert. The first transaction took place on Saturday, September 2, a couple of days after the Shibarium blockchain went public and started growing. Related Reading: Pro-XRP Legal Expert Takes The Spotlight With Daring Ripple Vs SEC Settlement Theory The transaction saw a total of 4.36 trillion SHIB tokens moved from the Bitvavo exchange to an unknown wallet. This transaction was worth roughly $37 million at the time and was speculated to be moved to a private wallet for holding. 🚨 🚨 4,630,530,677,374 #SHIB (36,696,955 USD) transferred from #Bitvavo to unknown wallethttps://t.co/XWDOaPcc0G — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) September 2, 2023 This is because when crypto users move tokens toward centralized exchanges, it is often to sell due to the deep liquidity. While moving tokens from centralized exchanges to private wallets is often for holding while investors wait for the market to recover. Another similar transaction was then flagged on Monday, September 4, carrying almost the same number of SHIB. The 4.615 trillion SHIB worth $35.69 million was also moved from the Bitvavo exchange to an unknown wallet, presumably for safekeeping. 🚨 🚨 4,615,530,677,374 #SHIB (35,694,206 USD) transferred from #Bitvavo to unknown wallethttps://t.co/ZtTK0oWWWn — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) September 4, 2023 These transactions could signal that the whales are expecting the Shibarium network to grow and positively affect the price of SHIB. The meme token is already showing signs of this recovery its trading volume rose 14% in the last day. Shibarium Continues To Grow Shibarium was launched in late August but despite an initial rocky start, the network seems to have taken it in stride and bounced back stronger. The activity on the network saw its Total Value Locked (TVL) quickly surpass $1 million. TVL crosses $1 million | Source DeFiLlama This was brought about by high activity in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols such as DogSwap and MARSWAP. The former currently boasts over 50% of Shibarium’s TVL with the latter not too far behind at 26%. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Marketing Lead Sends Important Message To SHIB Holders The network has also crossed the 1 million wallet market in addition to transactions on the blockchain reaching the same figure. However, the TVL has taken a hit to fall from the $1.42 million figure recorded on August 30 to be sitting at $1.05 million at the time of this writing. While the figures may be slowing for Shibarium, it may not mean a total lack of interest. Shibarium was launched in a deep bear market climate, which is one factor that could now be limiting its growth as prices fall.

Exchanges See Bitcoin Withdrawals Exceed Deposits For Three Consecutive Months An analyst on X explained that the total number of Bitcoin exchange withdrawals has been more than the deposits recently. The number of deposits and withdrawals and the number of such transactions are referred to here. All transfers on the network that go from a self-custodial wallet to a central exchange entity would count as deposit transactions, while those that go the opposite way would be withdrawals. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin exchange withdrawals and deposits over the last few years: How the two metrics have changed in value in recent years | Source: @ali_charts on X As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin exchange withdrawal transactions have been higher than the deposit transactions for around three months. This streak is a record for the cryptocurrency, as deposits have usually surged back above withdrawals before long whenever this pattern forms. There could be multiple interpretations of what this unusual run of withdrawals might say about the market. The analyst has listed a few hypotheses that may explain this trend. Related Reading: This Metric Hinted At The Bitcoin Retrace In Advance First and perhaps the most obvious one could be that the holders choose to hold their Bitcoin for extended periods instead of participating in trading or selling (which they generally use exchanges for). The second explanation may be that the investors have become more cautious of central entities, so they opt for the security that self-custodial wallets provide. This would make sense in light of several bankruptcies the sector has seen during the past year, where known names like FTX have gone down. Another hypothesis is just the reverse of the first one: the withdrawals are normal, but the deposits are muted, a result of holders not wanting to sell their coins through these platforms, so they aren’t making that many deposits anymore. Related Reading: This Could Be The Metric To Watch For A Bitcoin Bounce: Santiment Finally, the analyst notes, “given the recent regulatory changes in the US, investors prefer to keep their assets off exchanges to avoid potential complications.” Binance, the largest exchange in the world in terms of trading volume, has particularly been under fire lately.

These tokens have sat idle for a long time in the wallet as the legal battle between the exchange and its creditors waged on. The time of idleness for these assets may now be over though as recent activities show that a large chunk of tokens from the FTX wallets are now on the move. FTX Wallets Come Alive The FTX wallets are still holding large amounts of various tokens worth over $3.5 billion. These tokens include Solana (SOL) which makes up a large portion of the funds. This is because the exchange was one of the biggest backers of the Layer 1 blockchain and received a significant amount of vested SOL tokens in return. Related Reading: Pro-XRP Legal Expert Takes The Spotlight With Daring Ripple Vs SEC Settlement Theory Given the large amount that the wallets currently hold, it is a cause of concern when the entity begins moving tokens. This is what happened when on Sunday, an X (formerly Twitter) user raised awareness of the large amounts being moved out of the wallet. 🚨 FTX wallets on the move🚨 Over $1.5B worth of $SOL, SPL tokens, and Wrapped #Bitcoin in FTX’s Solana addresses are shifting‼️ Looks like they’re gearing up for potential sell-offs. Keep an eye on this, especially the ~$200M in #Solana Wrapped $BTC.#crypto #bitcoin … pic.twitter.com/sRDI6hvTJD — Pump House 🍥 (@pumphouz) September 3, 2023 The tokens being transferred out, starting from August 31, include Ethereum’s ETH, FTX’s FTT Token, Sushiswap’s SUSHI, and Uniswap’s UNI, among others. In total, around $14 million have been moved. Amid this, the X users asked community members to keep an eye on the around $200 million in Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) on the Solana network that the wallets hold. The assets were transferred to what looks to be another holding wallet using the Wormhole Bridge. However, while the destination of these tokens was not a crypto exchange, it has not stopped speculations about a potential sell-off from happening. “Looks like they’re gearing up for potential sell-offs,” the X user said. Where Are The Tokens Headed? A development that unfolded toward the end of August could tell where the tokens being transferred from the FTX wallet are headed. The exchange had filed a motion with the court on August 24 to allow it to employ the services of asset manager Galaxy Digital to help hedge its remaining assets against volatility. The Investment Services Agreement would see Galaxy Digital take control of FTX’s assets. This way, FTX plans to protect the value of the remaining assets, as well as profit from the investment decisions made by the Asse management. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Marketing Lead Sends Important Message To SHIB Holders Given that the asset transfers started a week after this filing, it is plausible that the exchange is moving assets into the custody of Galaxy Digital. Nevertheless, such a move would still result in a possible sell-off since it would have to “seek and obtain the most favorable terms reasonably available” and would be authorized to sell up to $100 million in tokens a week. The coin movements are also happening just one month until FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried is expected to face trial on fraud and mismanagement charges. The courts have said that SBF’s defense could file to postpone the trial date which would be considered. But for now, it seems the former CEO is set to go to trial on October 3.

Whale Supply Of Stablecoins Could Hold Key To Bitcoin Rebound In a recent post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment discussed the percentage of the total stablecoin supply that the whales in the sector are holding right now. The “whales” here refer to entities that are carrying at least $5 million worth of stablecoins in their addresses. Naturally, all stablecoins that are in circulation are included in this metric, regardless of their market caps. “A tried and true method for predicting where crypto heads next is analyzing big wallets to see the ratio of stablecoins they hold,” explains the analytics firm. Here is a chart that displays the data for the holdings of these humongous investors: The value of the metric seems to have been moving sideways in recent days | Source: Santiment on X The reason that the stablecoin supply of this cohort may be relevant for the rest of the cryptocurrency sector is that it provides a look into the buying power available to these whales. Related Reading: This Metric Hinted At The Bitcoin Retrace In Advance Generally, these holders use stables to store their capital away from the volatility of coins like Bitcoin, but once they feel that the time is right to jump back in, they deploy these fiat-tied tokens back into the other coins, providing a bullish boost to their prices. This can be seen working in action in the chart as well. Back in May-June, these investors had been accumulating, and once their supply had hit a peak and they had started distributing instead, the Bitcoin price had observed a rally. Given the close timing, it would seem likely that the whales had been shedding their stablecoin holdings in order to buy assets like BTC, thus acting as fuel for the uplift. As displayed in the graph, the stablecoin holdings of the whales haven’t changed much recently, suggesting that these investors haven’t been taking part in either accumulation or distribution. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Recovery Could Soon Fade If BTC Fails To Surpass 100 SMA This could indicate that the whales don’t have any extraordinary buying capacity currently. An uplift in this indicator, however, would imply that the purchasing power of this cohort is going up, which could then lead towards a rebound for the rest of the market. One positive sign forming in the market may be the fact that the market cap of the six largest stablecoins is slowly starting to turn around. Looks like the indicator's value has been heading up recently | Source: Santiment on X The combined market cap of these large stablecoins has been in a perpetual downtrend since early 2022, suggesting a constant drainage of capital from the sector. In the past couple of weeks, though, these fiat-tied assets have seen a combined growth of $663.2 million, which may be one of the early signs that a rebound could finally be taking place. Such small rises in the metric have already been seen a few times during this downtrend, though, so this latest one might as well turn out to be a temporary deviation like those previous ones. If, however, this recent increase is indeed a sign that things are finally changing, then it would mean that the cryptocurrency sector is seeing some constructive growth at last.

The token’s price surged by 7.3% in the past 24 hours and recorded a 2.3% increase over the past week, now resting at $0.122461 according to CoinGecko. While cryptocurrency enthusiasts are rejoicing over the impressive price performance, the question that lingers on everyone’s mind is: why did Stellar’s price jump during the weekend? Two plausible explanations have emerged. Related Reading: Pepe Coin September Challenge: Can It Reach $0.000001 Again?

Stay curious 😎 pic.twitter.com/CgNzfzwqmc — Stellar (@StellarOrg) September 2, 2023 Another factor that might have contributed to the bullish sentiment around Stellar is the upcoming Meridian event set to be hosted by the blockchain platform later this month in Spain. Meridian, known as Stellar’s flagship annual event, is expected to bring together a multitude of influential speakers from the blockchain and cryptocurrency space. Their speeches and insights have the potential to significantly influence market dynamics, possibly explaining the increased demand for XLM. 25 days until #Meridian2023! Get ready to dive into over 70 insightful sessions, connect with industry leaders, and unlock endless possibilities. Grab your spot today! https://t.co/lRAGVzFLRl — Stellar (@StellarOrg) September 1, 2023 Technical Analysis Indicates Potential Challenges Ahead Despite the recent surge, some technical indicators suggest potential challenges for Stellar. XLM has consistently closed daily sessions below the mid-range price of $0.1150, signaling increasing seller leverage. A weekly session closure below this level could confirm the sellers’ advancement, potentially pushing XLM toward the range low of approximately $0.1000. However, this range low is not without its silver lining. It coincides with a daily bullish Order Book (OB) ranging from $0.0953 to $0.0986, creating a strong support zone for the cryptocurrency. Investors will be closely monitoring whether XLM can maintain its foothold in this zone or if further bearish pressure awaits. XLM market cap currently at $3.4 billion in the daily chart: TradingView.com In the past few days, funding rates in the crypto market have been predominantly negative, underscoring the prevailing bearish bias. This bearish sentiment is further supported by the declining Open Interest (OI) rates witnessed in August and early September. The decrease in OI reflects reduced demand for XLM during this period, suggesting that investors remain cautious in the face of market uncertainties. Related Reading: Surging Toncoin Price And Telegram Bot Tokens – What’s The Connection?

17066543,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=549921,1693830647,"Expert Market Analysts Agree A Spot Bitcoin ETF Is A Matter Of When, Not If","The crypto community has been kept at the edge of its seat as the SEC decided to postpone a decision on the 7 Spot Bitcoin ETFs filed over the last few months. During such a pensive time, market analysts have predicted the SEC authorizing a Spot Bitcoin ETF while the former SEC Chairman foresees a losing battle for the regulator. JP Morgan Analysts Foresee ETFs Approval The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Grayscale, an American digital currency investing and crypto asset management company have been embroiled in a legal battle since June 2022. The SEC had previously rejected Grayscale’s request to convert its GBTC vehicle to an ETF. The digital currency investment company had responded to the rejection with a lawsuit, suing the SEC and filing a petition for a review by the United States Court of Appeal for the District of Columbia Circuit. Related Reading: Pro-XRP Legal Expert Takes The Spotlight With Daring Ripple Vs SEC Settlement Theory The legal proceedings have not been favorable with the SEC, and analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou from JP Morgan, a New York-based universal bank have predicted the eventual acceptance of Bitcoin ETF applications by the SEC. The prediction is also largely supported by Grayscale’s victory against the SEC in a recent court ruling that classified the SEC’s denial of Bitcoin ETF applications as unreasonable and without substance, mandating the SEC to reevaluate its decision to deny Grayscale’s Bitcoin ETF application. While the SEC deliberates on its next move, the regulator has announced that it requires more time to decide on Bitcoin ETF propositions from several companies including WisdomTree and Blackrock. The regulator has also requested a postponement until mid-October. The JPMorgan analysts believe that the SEC’s delay is a positive sign that Bitcoin ETFs will be approved soon. The analysts have also stated that the SEC would find it difficult to justify their rejection of Bitcoin ETF approval after accepting a previous proposal for future-based Bitcoin ETFs. The situation places the SEC in a precarious predicament and consequently, JP Morgan analysts have concluded that the SEC is likely to be compelled to approve the pending Bitcoin ETF applications from Grayscale and various asset management companies. Former SEC Chairman Says “Spot Bitcoin ETF Is Inevitable” A prominent X (formerly Twitter) influencer, Collin Brown released a post on Monday, 4th September revealing that the former Chairman of the US SEC, Jay Clayton sees an undisputed win for Grayscale in the Bitcoin ETF case. Brown stated that Clayton foresaw the “inevitable” acceptance of Bitcoin ETF proposals by the SEC and the post highlighted the time the SEC may conclude their decision on Bitcoin ETF applications, ultimately ending the legal feud between the SEC and Grayscale. “Former SEC Chairman Jay Clayton predicts the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF is inevitable! The SEC might make the announcement in mid-October, or it could take a bit longer, but progress is on the horizon for crypto enthusiasts,” the post read. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Marketing Lead Sends Important Message To SHIB Holders However, the X account was later suspended following the announcement. In contrast, an ex-SEC Attorney, John Reed Stark declared in an X post that the chances of the SEC approving Bitcoin ETFs are implausible and crypto enthusiasts should not expect any other outcome. While the crypto community is cheering and hoping for Grayscale’s complete victory over the SEC, investors are preparing for a possible Bitcoin price surge that may follow the SEC’s approval of Bitcoin ETFs.

42409741,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcOmtx,1693830304,"Singapore's New President, a Former Central Bank Chairman, Has Called Crypto 'Slightly Crazy'","Singapore's new president is Tharman Shanmugaratnam, previously the country's finance minister and central bank chairman.  While the role is largely ceremonial, Shanmugaratnam's financial experience may give him some influence over relevant policy.  The 66-year-old has called crypto ""purely speculative"" and ""slightly crazy.""  Tharman Shanmugaratnam, the former Singapore finance minister and central bank chairman who has called crypto ""purely speculative"" and ""slightly crazy,"" was elected the country's president Saturday with 70.4% of the vote, replacing Halimah Yacob, its first female head of state.  While the role is largely ceremonial, the 66-year-old's experience might mean he has some influence in shaping policy related to the future of finance, including cryptocurrencies, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and more.  Singapore has gone from being an early adopter of crypto to a jurisdiction trying to find the right regulatory balance after the collapse of homegrown crypto darlings Terraform Labs and Three Arrows Capital while Shanmugaratnam was chairman of Singapore's central bank, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).  That was a role he held between 2011 and 2023, overlapping his time as finance minister between 2007 and 2015. He began his career as an economist at the MAS in 1982 after a receiving a Bachelor of Science in Economics from the London School of Economics, a Master of Philosophy in Economics from the University of Cambridge and a Master in Public Administration from Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government. He was also short-listed for the top job at the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Shanmugaratnam spent 22 years as a member of parliament, holding several governmental roles including deputy prime minister,  Shanmugaratnam's early stance on cryptocurrencies was laissez faire.  In 2018, when he wrote cryptocurrency and related trading activity did not pose any threat to Singapore's finance system, and there was no need to prohibit it.  He reiterated that stance in 2023, saying at the World Economic Forum, that crypto is ""inherently purely speculative and in fact slightly crazy."" While it should remain an unregulated market, he suggested authorities should provide ""ultra clarity"" on the risks associated with crypto because to ""start getting into a game of regulating products, ostrich eggs or crypto or anything else"" would be a ""never-ending game.""  Still, for banks and stablecoins the situation is somewhat different.  In November 2022, Shanmugaratnam wrote a response to a question in parliament saying that Singapore's banks are required to hold $125 of capital against an exposure of $100 to cryptocurrencies like bitcoin (BTC) or ether (ETH). ""Although the jurisdiction's banks have 'insignificant' levels of exposure to crypto – contributing less than 0.05% of total risk weighted assets – these types of crypto assets are subject to the toughest risk management requirements set by international standard-setters,"" he wrote.  He added that the prudential treatment for less risky crypto assets, such as tokenized corporate bonds, is similar to the traditional non-tokenized asset.  In 2021, Shanmugaratnam said ""there may be a role for crypto in future finance that extends beyond pure speculation and illicit finance"" and that he envisioned a future in which ""regulated stablecoins will have a useful role in a traditional payment system.""  In August 2022, Shanmugaratnam said the MAS was ""actively reviewing"" its approach to regulating stablecoins and could potentially bring reserve requirements for stablecoin issuers, referencing the collapse of terraUSD (UST) a stablecoin that lost its U.S. dollar peg the previous May. Last month, the MAS released a regulatory framework for stablecoins.

42409734,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcOmQC,1693829228,Australia Senate Committee Rejects Crypto Bill From Opposition Senator Andrew Bragg,"Australia's Senate Economics Legislation Committee rejected ""The Digital Assets (Market Regulation) Bill 2023"" introduced by opposition senator Andrew Bragg, recommending instead that the government ""continue to consult with industry on the development of fit-for-purpose digital assets regulation in Australia.""  The committee's report is along party lines. Bragg, who represents New South Wales, criticized the rejection, saying the Labor government had ""put regulating crypto in the slow lane.""  The committee said the bill lacked detail and certainty and was at odds with the government's approach. The bill was ""not congruent with international regimes"" and caused ""genuine concern for regulatory arbitrage and adverse outcomes to the industry,"" it said.  Prime Minister Anthony Albanese introduced a token mapping consultation paper through the Treasury in February which was supposed to lead to a separate consultation paper proposing a licensing and custody framework for crypto asset service providers in mid-2023, but that has not happened yet.  “The Senate Committee was expected to report on this Bill over a month ago and the industry has been eagerly awaiting Treasury consultation on crypto-custody and licensing,"" said Blockchain Australia Chair and Digital Assets Lawyer Michael Bacina. ""That consultation should be able to build on the industry submissions published as part of the Senate Committee’s review of this Bill.”  The central bank started a pilot test to explore potential use cases for Australia's own CBDC and last month concluded ""any decision on a CBDC in Australia is likely to be some years away.""

42409752,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcOnR1,1693828860,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Hovers Below $26K; Stellar’s XLM Rallies,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin traded in a tight range in the past 24 hours, staying between $25,800 and $26,000 after a price spike last week when the cryptocurrency topped $28,000 after a federal appeals court ruled the SEC must review its rejection of Grayscale Investments' attempt to convert its GBTC into an ETF. Bitcoin retreated as the SEC delayed key ETF decisions that were expected on Friday, damping traders’ hopes of a long-term recovery. “As we enter September, the cryptoasset market remains on the edge of its seat as various macroeconomic and regulatory narratives continue to leave investors guessing,” said Simon Peters, an analyst at eToro. “With the route to lower rates still unclear and bitcoin spot ETF approvals still waiting, the market will continue its guessing game on major cryptoassets’ direction of travel.” Stellar’s XLM was the only digital asset which saw notable gains on Monday, advancing 10% on the day.  It is more likely the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will be forced to approve spot bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded-fund (ETF) applications from several asset managers after a federal court said the regulator must review its rejection of Grayscale’s attempt to convert the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an ETF, JPMorgan (JPM) said in a report Friday. “The most important element of the Grayscale vs. SEC court ruling was that the denial by SEC was arbitrary and capricious because the Commission failed to explain its different treatment of similar products i.e., futures-based bitcoin ETFs,” analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote. Grayscale and CoinDesk are both owned by Digital Currency Group (DCG). The court argued that fraud and manipulation in the spot market posed a similar risk to both futures and spot products because the “spot bitcoin market and CME bitcoin futures market are so tightly correlated,” the report said.  Cryptocurrency exchange Binance has seen another senior executive depart, with Global Product Lead Mayur Kamat heading for the door. We can confirm that Mayur has stepped down,"" a spokesperson said in an emailed statement. ""We are grateful to him for helping guide Binance through some of our most explosive growth and we wish him the very best."" A former vice president of product at travel agent Agoda, Kamat joined Binance in April 2022. Kamat's departure follows those of Chief Strategy Officer Patrick Hillmann, Senior Director of Investigations Matthew Price, SVP for Compliance Steven Christie, who left the company in early July, and Asia-Pacific Head Leon Foong, who quit in August.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the ratio between 30-day realized volatility for ether and bitcoin and the 20-day moving average of the ratio.  The ratio has dropped below 1, meaning ether has recently seen less volatility than bitcoin, an unusual situation, according to historical data.

17063791,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=549911,1693827024,Dogecoin Price Slide Persists Despite This Elon Musk Biography Revelation,"The upcoming biography of Elon Musk, set to be published on September 12, is shedding light on some previously unknown facets of the billionaire’s involvement in the crypto and especially Dogecoin world. According to a report by the Wall Street Journal, the biography discloses that Musk has been discreetly funding the development of Dogecoin. The tech entrepreneur Musk has been “quietly funding” the development of Dogecoin, the biography unveils, further emphasizing the significant influence Musk has had on the meme coin’s popularity. This revelation comes amidst previous suspicions that Musk’s comments on Dogecoin have been instrumental in swaying its market dynamics. Earlier this year, a class-action lawsuit accused him of insider trading and artificially inflating the cryptocurrency’s price. Musk, however, defended his stance, asserting that his tweets in support of Dogecoin were not illegal. The biography, penned by Walter Isaacson, also highlights Musk’s consideration of launching a blockchain-based social media platform with integrated payments. The idea came from his brother Kimbal, who suggested starting a completely new social media platform based on blockchain. Musk humorously contemplated using Dogecoin as the platform’s payment system. Remarkably, Musk recently clarified that X, the rebranded version of Twitter which he acquired for $44 billion, would “never” introduce its own token. Related Reading: Dogecoin And Bitcoin Become Latest Additions To Robinhood Wallet Interestingly, the biography also delves into a failed investment attempt by Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), the former CEO of the insolvent crypto exchange FTX. SBF had reportedly proposed a $5 billion investment to aid Musk’s acquisition of Twitter. However, following the collapse of FTX, Musk clarified that neither he nor Twitter had ever accepted investments from SBF or FTX. Dogecoin Price Is Unimpressed Despite the intriguing revelations from Musk’s biography, Dogecoin’s price trajectory seems to remain unaffected. Currently trading at $0.0633, DOGE’s price movement on the 4-hour chart appears to be in a tight range, oscillating between the 23.6% ($0.0626) and 38.2% Fibonacci retracement levels ($0.0667), displaying a sideways trend in the lower time frame (LTF). However, a look at the higher time frame (HTF), the 1-day chart, paints a different picture. Dogecoin’s price has been ensnared in a persistent downtrend since December of the previous year. This downtrend, characterized by a descending trend channel, has remained intact. In late July, DOGE experienced a bounce off the upper trendline of this channel, only to resume its steady decline. Concerningly, pivotal support levels, including the 200-day EMA, have been breached, signaling potential bearish momentum. Based on the current chart patterns, there’s a looming possibility that DOGE might retest its annual low at $0.05593. In a more pessimistic scenario, a descent to the lower boundary of the descending channel, pegged roughly at $0.05, seems possible.

42409746,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcOn0Z,1693825800,What Can DAOs Learn From Partisan Politics?,"Taking a page out of the political book could put DAOs, or decentralized autonomous organizations, on the path to achieving the sweet spot between efficiency and decentralization. In particular, DAOs can learn from the way in which political parties elect representatives, run campaigns and meet long-term goals all while sustaining continuous support from a community that is not always aligned.  This may sound counterintuitive, given that DAOs are supposed to be new ways of building organizations. And why would anyone want to take a page out of political operations, known for being dysfunctional?  While DAOs offer significant advantages over traditional organizations, most DAOs are still trying to overcome the same fundamental roadblocks: achieving efficiency and consensus within the community. These issues are often a result of poor governance structures and poor communication.  Danny Chong is the co-founder of Tranchess, a decentralized yield-enhancing asset tracker.  In particular, most token holders can typically draft proposals today. This may enable something like direct democracy (or what some may even consider ""decentralized"" governance), but it lends itself to inefficiency. When anyone can propose anything, long-term goals become too diffused.  Additionally, DAOs have had long-standing communication problems. Poor communication often causes backlash, delays important roadmap checkpoints from being decided or executed and reveals a lack of genuine consensus within the community.  These issues are clearly issues with the community rather than the code that comprises a DAO. Which is why they might be addressed by looking at some key practices of political parties.  Lack of expertise and foresight  As mentioned, allowing all token holders to make proposals diffuses the organization's objectives and often creates a conflict between the short-term interests of the token holder and the long-term goals of the project itself. This problem comes in all shapes and sizes.  See also: Why Traditional Investors May Not Love DAOs  Firstly, this can result in too many proposals. When proposals come flooding in, many of which are low-quality or are written by someone with their head in the clouds, it can make it difficult for the DAO to prioritize what's important and make decisions in a timely manner. This can be made worse by poor filtration systems meaning that many proposals will be overlooked or missed altogether.  Another problem is that many token holders lack expertise. Not all token holders have the same level of knowledge in the areas that are relevant to the DAO. Therefore proposals are often neither well-thought-out nor in the best interests of the DAO.  Lastly, a lower turnout in voting by token holders can allow proposals to be pushed through by relatively small groups leading to decisions that are not properly aligned with the majority view of the DAO and its roadmap.  Formalizing goals and plans  Political parties elect representatives who draft laws for constituencies. They are elected by the people, and can be removed from office should they cease to represent the will of the people. This creates a context for policies to be made in the electorate's best interests.  DAOs should work in a similar way, whereby the community votes for individuals who are responsible for creating proposals that guide the projects’ future. Elected individuals would have a strong track record contributing to the DAO, and should demonstrably be aligned with the project’s goals.  And should protocol politicians become unaligned, the community can vote for someone else. This kind of structure would also limit or disincentive bad actors from taking control and causing mischief. It may even limit the number of people who rage quit from DAOs.  Campaign for DAO policies  The recent backlash following Arbitrum’s first DAO vote highlighted the importance of keeping the community properly informed about their future plans. Arbitrum Foundation’s Patrick McCorry stated the issue was due to a “shortfalling in communication.”  Had there been more transparency and more of a “campaign” in the run-up to Arbitrum's vote, it is possible that there would not have been as much outrage from the community.  Political parties and candidates campaign extensively for proposed policies ahead of elections. Campaigns help inform voters about the candidates' positions on the issues and their plans for the future. DAOs need to undergo a similar period so that the community is fully informed about the proposals they will eventually vote on.  Thorough research is likely needed to understand the concerns and aspirations of constituents — in DAOs and the great public. And so political parties may take into account demographics, preferences and which policies are higher in priority to inform decision-making.  While this cannot be blanket applied because of the product development-focused nature of crypto, a better understanding of who is being communicated to and their concerns could shape how well proposals resonate with the target audience.  Message framing is also done carefully by using compelling narratives and case studies to make policies relatable and impactful. Rather than only focusing on the practical aspects of a proposal, DAOs can better contextualize their plans by connecting them to stories and tangible examples that resonate with people.  Finally, political parties privilege grassroots engagement. There is immense value in the organizing and mobilization of efforts at the ground level. Local networks of volunteers and key community leaders are empowered to speak to their circles of influence, either directly or through door-to-door canvassing, town hall meetings and local events.  For DAOs interested in grassroots mobilization, this can be done through AMAs [ask me anythings] with community managers and a rotating system of community managers.  The dark side to politics  By no means should DAOs try to operate in exactly the same way as political parties. Namely, electing people to positions of power and limiting who can set policies has the potential to corrupt even the most community minded.  To mitigate centralization, leadership roles will constantly need to be assessed and term limits imposed. Like in democracies, after a certain period, DAO members should vote for other representatives to ensure decentralization and diverse ideas.  See also: DAOs Don't Have to Be Completely Decentralized  Another issue with political parties is that constituents can be persuaded by personal bias, favoritism and potentially misleading personalities. Therefore, electing DAO leaders should not become personality contests. Focusing instead on a person's policies will ensure decisions would be in the best interests of the DAO as a whole.  Improving politics  Beyond that, DAOs have in many ways already proven to be more effective than political parties. For example, DAO decisions are recorded on public blockchains, meaning that anyone can see how the ship is being steered. while political parties often operate in secrecy.  DAOs are also by nature decentralized and so are location-agnostic. In a world that increasingly requires international coordination, this allows people across the globe to join. That means organizations can attract the best of the best, and can more truly represent diverse viewpoints.  And finally, DAOs can be more agile than traditional organizations that are often hampered by long, bureaucratic processes.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | RESEARCH | ARB,Danny Chong,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/09/04/what-can-daos-learn-from-partisan-politics,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d4580ade63877052c518f5cd1dcd4c24a33bcbff-6561x3691.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Crypto enthusiasts have long regarded Telegram as a pioneer in exploring blockchain technology. Toncoin’s genesis lies in the “Telegram Open Network” (TON) project which, after facing legal hurdles, rebranded as “The Open Network” in 2020. In recent months, TON has witnessed a surge in investor interest, evident from on-chain data and Santiment’s TON Social Dominance chart, which recorded a significant spike in June 2023. This heightened attention has played a pivotal role in propelling TON’s price upwards, with its current value at $1.89, as reported by CoinGecko. Notably, TON has gained 1.8% in the last 24 hours and an impressive 28.9% over the past seven days. Source: Santiment Telegram-Affiliated Tokens Outshine The Crypto Market While the global crypto market cap has seen a contraction of nearly 10% since August 1, Telegram-affiliated tokens have defied the trend, delivering consistent double-digit gains during the same period. This intriguing correlation hints at the emergence of yet another thriving sector within the crypto market. What adds to the intrigue is the fact that these bot tokens have yet to find their way onto mainstream exchanges. As a result, the fear of missing out (FOMO) could intensify among strategic investors eager to capitalize on potential gains once these tokens hit the exchange listings. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Faces Potential Loss As Bearish Pattern Emerges Toncoin Breakout Signals Market Shift September 1 marked a significant turning point for Toncoin, as its price broke free from the resistance trendline that had held it in a downtrend for over eight months. This breakout signifies a change in market dynamics, where participants may transition from selling on rallies sentiment to buying on dips. TON market cap currently at $6.4 billion. Chart: TradingView.com The road ahead for TON appears promising, with price targets set at $2, $2.37, and $2.64. These milestones represent the evolving landscape of Telegram-affiliated tokens and the growing influence of the TON Network within the crypto ecosystem. Related Reading: BNB Price Forecast: Will It Break Through Resistance At $225? In the midst of Toncoin’s solid ascent, Telegram-bot tokens have come into focus, rekindling interest in the TON Network’s close ties with Telegram. This newfound attention has triggered a significant surge in TON’s value, while the broader crypto market grapples with fluctuations. As these tokens await mainstream exchange listings, strategic investors eagerly eye potential gains in this burgeoning sector, fueling the ever-expanding crypto narrative.

Volume over the past 24-hours has risen by more than 250% to $96 million, according to CoinMarketCap, with one newly-created wallet withdrawing $7.7 million worth of SNX tokens from Binance, per Lookonchain.  Token outflows typically suggest a pattern of buying, as traders prefer to retain full control of their assets in order to vote in governance or secure a yield.  Aside from withdrawing SNX, the wallet in question also withdrew $3.9 million worth of livepeer tokens (LPT), prompting an individual surge of 17.5%.  The rise of the two assets comes during a wider lull in the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) continue to trade at range lows of $26,000 and $1,300 respectively following a week that saw $60 billion wiped from crypto's overall market cap.  Liquidity across altcoin trading pairs often retract during these downturns, creating an environment that is prone to volatility.  In this case, LPT token has 2% market depth on Binance of just $70,000 to the upside and $270,000 to the downside. This means that a trade can move the price of the asset by 2% by buying or selling those amounts.

The industry will get its first spot bitcoin ETF some time between mid-October and mid-March, and approval of all spot ETF applications, including Grayscale, will happen at the same time, the report said.  “The industry push for an ether (ETH) spot ETF follows immediately after, given ETH also has a similar market structure of a traded CME futures market and a spot market,” the analysts wrote.  The asset management industry is expected to push beyond bitcoin and ether into areas including other top blockchains, such as Solana and Polygon, and even leading decentralized finance (DeFi) assets, the note said. DeFi is an umbrella term used for lending, trading and other financial activities carried out on a blockchain, without traditional intermediaries.  This is a massive commercial opportunity for the asset management industry to generate healthy fees in a burgeoning asset class, the note added.  “The strong showing in the courts (Ripple and Grayscale in 2 months), improved ETF chances and the progressive institutional interest, are positioning crypto for an unprecedented capital led cycle, unlike the retail led crypto cycles of the past,” the report added.

Bitfarms executives have also mentioned the possibility of entering the AI market during their Q2 earnings call. The upcoming Bitcoin halving event and mining economics pose challenges for Bitfarms' profitability, but the company's balance sheet remains strong. In these conditions, the stock is a Hold, but there are trading opportunities. According to some analysts, cryptocurrency miners are diversifying into the artificial intelligence market in order to try to compensate for lower margins resulting from Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) prices plummeting to less than half of the November 2021 peak. This possibility was also evoked by Bitfarms' ( BITF ) executives during the second quarter 2023 (Q2) earnings call on August 8 as I will further elaborate later. Data by YCharts Now, offering AI computing services at a time when Nvidia’s (NASDAQ: NVDA ) GPUs are in high demand would surely alleviate the supply issues some enterprises are facing and also generate windfall gains for the miners but it is important to assess whether transiting from blockchain's hashrates to Generative AI's large language models is feasible. In the meantime, given more pressing concerns like the effects of inflation and mining difficulty on crypto production costs as well as the upcoming bitcoin halving event, the aim of this thesis is to assess whether the company's finances are healthy enough to navigate the current crypto bear market. I start with Bitcoin halving which has a direct impact on its supply. Bitcoin Halving and Mining Economics This fourth Bitcoin halving event is estimated for April 26, 2024, which means that the reward for producing the coin will go down from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC or a 50% drop. The objective is to reduce the supply and contribute to Bitcoin scarcity, in turn increasing its value. However, this key aspect of Bitcoin’s foundational policy has not worked to sustainably raise the cryptocurrency's value, as in addition to the demand-supply equation, there are also other market forces that determine its price. One of them is volatility which grappled the cryptocurrency world in November last year after Sam Bankman-Fried’s cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapsed also impacting Genesis Global which paused client withdrawals amid the unprecedented market turmoil that followed. Another factor that has an effect on Bitcoin’s value is inflation as shown in the orange chart below. Data by YCharts Now, fiat currencies such as the dollar or the euro can be printed at will by each country's central bank at times of economic turmoil as part of monetary policy loosening, but on the flip side causes high inflation as was the case on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean in 2021. In sharp contrast, not controlled by any central bank, the amount of bitcoin created is limited which explains why its price surged as inflation accelerated as shown in the blue chart above. Coming back to the effect of Bitcoin halving on Bitfarms, for the same amount of computational work its mining operations contribute to the network, fewer bitcoins will be obtained in return. This means that the management will have to exercise cost control in order not to go bankrupt like the weakest players in the industry. Network Difficulty and Finances Now, one of the ways the miner has optimized costs is by using the energy-efficient Bitmain S19Jpro , which allows for higher hashrates or computational power at lower costs. For powering its mining farm, Bitfarms' energy mix consists of over 85% hydroelectric power which, unlike fossil fuel sources, is subject to less variable costs. Additionally, capex intensity has been lowered through the use of equipment lines of credit. Still, mining economics have been exceptionally unfavorable in Q2, namely because of an inflation-driven 6.5% hike by utilities in Quebec which accounts for about 75% of energy needs. Another factor that adversely affect revenue was mining network difficulty increasing by 24% sequentially which resulted in only 1,223 Bitcoin being mined compared to 1,297 in the first quarter (Q1). This difficulty pertains to finding a block in the blockchain and increased considerably in Q2, by 67% YoY as more mining pools participated in minting coins, adding to cryptocurrency energy production costs. Thus, the cost to produce one Bitcoin climbed to $15,700, from only $12,500 in the first quarter. Looking at the industry, this figure was still lower than HIVE Digital's ( HIVE ) average cost of production $18,687 , and Hut 8 Mining’s (NASDAQ: HUT ) $21,766 (or CAD$ 29,600). Furthermore, despite the higher cost of production, adjusted EBITDA has improved to $7.7 million mostly as a result of higher revenue of $35.5 million due to an increase in the price of bitcoin in Q2, but, still, the income statement showed a $24.9 million net loss. Company Presentation (investor.bitfarms.com) However, the balance sheet remains strong, with cash of $31 million and the Bitcoins in the treasury totaling around $17 million, signifying about $48 million in liquidity, widely offsetting approximately $31.7 million of debt at the end of Q2. Another aspect of the finances is the relatively high operating cash flow with $36.3 million for fiscal year 2022. Valuations, Potential AI Revenues and Risks As a result, Bitfarms' trailing Price/Cash Flow of 7x is more than 60% undervalued relative to peers in the IT industry. Despite this favorable valuation, I consider the stock to be a hold and, there are three reasons for this. First, there are still uncertainties as to the effects of lingering inflation and mining difficulty on profitability as I touched upon earlier. Second, with its lower production costs, Bitfarms has a better chance of ""surviving"" the halving effect. Still, in addition to being advantageous in terms of supply-driven price dynamics, halving also poses challenges, as it entails the use of more electrical power for producing the same number of bitcoins. Third, its current price of $1.3 is not far from the $1.00 minimum closing bid price requirement by the Nasdaq Stock Exchange. In this case, the risk is that there may be a high level of volatility in case the stock falls below the one-dollar level for a specific time period especially when the Stock Exchange sends a compliance notice to the miner. Shifting to a positive tone, lower profitability could be offset by an improvement in revenue levels in case the price of the cryptocurrency increases. Well, this may become a possibility after a U.S. court overturned a decision by the Securities and Exchange Commission to deny Grayscale’s application to convert its existing Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( OTC:GBTC ) into a spot ETF. Now, with assets under management of $13.8 billion , this does not mean that this large OTC-traded Bitcoin fund will now automatically be traded as a SPOT ETF, but Bitcoin gaining more than 5% when the news hit the markets as shown below suggests that there are reasons for being optimistic. Data by YCharts Looking at the possibility of initiating a new AI-led revenue stream, this is unlikely to be that straightforward, as the S19JPro mining equipment used by Bitfarms makes use of ASIC chips for calculating the hashrate while AI makes use of GPUs or graphics processing units. Still, given that there is currently a shortage of data center space in North America, the company can reallocate some of its facilities towards AI but this will require investments in terms of generators and UPS (uninterruptible power supply). In this case, conventional data centers consume less power but it first needs to be stabilized, in contrast with crypto mining rigs which can run directly on utility power. Noteworthily, the management is evaluating the AI diversification path very closely while also paying attention to metrics like margins and longevity. Concluding with the Trading Potential In conclusion, the company's balance sheet is healthy and could benefit from higher bitcoin prices as asset managers push further for the approval of a spot ETF, but unfavorable mining economics could further deteriorate the net loss in the balance of 2023 and next year as the halving event looms. On a different note, as seen for two other Bitcoin mining plays which saw their share prices jump by over 17% when they announced deals covering cloud and AI, this could also favorably impact Bitfarms' stock in case it also makes a similar move. In this respect, the price could surge to $1.53 based on the current share price of $1.31 and a 17% upside depending on the veracity of the news update. Even more gains could be made in case there are further developments as to the process of launching a Bitcoin spot ETF, as Grayscale is not alone since giant asset manager BlackRock ( BLK ) and other Wall Street investment banks have also made similar moves. Finally, during trading, the stock should be held for only a limited time period, and if the targeted gains have not been attained, it is preferable to exit with a stop loss rather than holding on to the stock as is normally the case during investing.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4632907-bitfarms-gloomy-mining-economics-ai-trading-opportunity?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/17597795.jpeg

Following this, Pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton has stated a key factor that could lead to a settlement between both parties. Coinbase’s Motion Key To Settlement In a tweet released on the X (formerly Twitter) platform, Deaton stated that the “only way” the SEC and Ripple can settle this year is if Judge Failla grants Coinbase’s motion to dismiss the SEC’s lawsuit against it. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Marketing Lead Sends Important Message To SHIB Holders The lawyer believes that the key is for Judge Failla to find that token sales on an exchange as part of a programmatic sale do not fall under US securities laws. If that happens, the Commission and its chair, Gary Gensler, may have no choice but to “pivot,” according to Deaton. He further noted that Judge Failla’s ruling may be final as he doubts the Solicitor General would allow an appeal as the case could end up reaching the Supreme Court, which could “strip away” the SEC’s powers and that of other federal agencies. The SEC had filed a lawsuit against Coinbase, alleging that the biggest crypto exchange in the US was operating as an unregistered securities exchange by offering several cryptocurrencies on its platform without first registering with the SEC. In response, Coinbase filed a motion to dismiss the case, stating that the regulator was stepping outside its jurisdiction with such an action. The exchange said the token sales weren’t investment contracts but more commodity sales, with “obligations on both sides discharged” once the transaction occurred. Interestingly, Coinbase cited Judge Torres’ ruling in favor of Ripple that programmatic sales, such as ones on exchanges, didn’t constitute investment contracts. XRP price remains volatile as legal battle continues | Source: XRPUSDT on Tradingview.com How Deaton’s Ripple Settlement Theory Could Play Out Going by Deaton’s theory, it is believed that the SEC would want to settle with Ripple if the court ruled that the Commission has no jurisdiction over token sales on exchanges. This is plausible because Judge Failla granting Coinbase’s request represents a setback for the Commission in its case against Ripple. The SEC argues that Ripple’s programmatic sales constituted an investment contract, making XRP a security. However, a win for Coinbase ultimately makes the programmatic sales argument baseless, and it can no longer further the argument since token sales on exchanges are outside its purview. Related Reading: New Job Listing Indicates What Ripple Is Focusing On Next Regarding the SEC and Gensler wanting to “pivot,” as mentioned by Deaton, this could mean the Commission solely focusing on Ripple’s sale to institutional investors, which the court ruled constituted an investment contract. Considering that the regulator still has a long way to go to prove which institutional sales were made to domestic investors (the only ones the SEC has jurisdiction over), it may settle with Ripple rather than prolong a case it may eventually lose.

Facts relating to FTX’s bankruptcy, U.S. operations and alleged campaign finance violations have been put into question.  FTX ads featuring comedian Larry David and American football player Tom Brady show a blurring between the bankrupt crypto exchange’s U.S. and international businesses, a Friday night filing by the U.S Department of Justice has said.  Sam Bankman-Fried, FTX’s founder and former CEO, is sparring about exactly what evidence the government can bring in support of charges that include wire fraud – and he's accused the DOJ of introducing corruption and campaign finance allegations through the back door. Bankman-Fried has pleaded not guilty, and the trial starts Oct. 2.  Bankman-Fried’s lawyers say legally separate U.S operations should be carved out, as accusations relate to the international business. The government says the distinction not so clear-cut, citing a now infamous series of ads aired just months before a great crypto crash that eventually took down Bankman-Fried’s empire.  “Celebrities are featured in advertisements describing ‘FTX’ as ‘a safe and easy way to get into crypto’ and showing customers using a device displaying the FTX logo, not the FTX.US logo,” said the DOJ filing, citing a Super Bowl ad featuring David and a separate spot with Brady and his then-wife Gisele Bündchen. “Internal documents indicate that FTX made no distinction between advertising for the international platform and for FTX.US.”  The DOJ also wants to go over the fine details surrounding FTX’s collapse, arguing they’re “inextricably intertwined” with the alleged misappropriation of customer funds.  While Bankman-Fried has argued he was strong-armed into ceding control of a company that could have returned to financial health, the government has said events around the bankruptcy are of interest to the jury even if the eventual fate of FTX is not.  “Whether customers could be made whole in the future ‘is immaterial as a matter of law,’” the DOJ said. Testimony will show that FTX co-founder Gary Wang helped Bankman-Fried move assets to the Bahamas on Nov. 11, which were “plainly acts in furtherance of the charged wire fraud scheme,” the government said.  Bahamas  Bankman-Fried’s lawyers have accused the government of effectively circumventing the terms of his extradition from the Bahamas, from where he ran company operations. The DOJ recently withdrew charges relating to campaign finance laws and the alleged bribery of Chinese officials, as they weren’t covered in the original request to bring him to the U.S.  In bringing in evidence related to those charges, the government is “seeking to claw back the Government’s earlier narrowing of the case and to try Mr. Bankman-Fried on the severed and withdrawn counts,” Bankman-Fried’s filing said. “The sole discernible impact on this trial of admitting evidence of the alleged bribery would be to risk improperly inducing the jury to believe Mr. Bankman-Fried had a criminal propensity.”  Bankman-Fried was arrested in December, and was last month deemed to breach bail conditions by contacting witnesses and leaking potential evidence to the New York Times. His lawyers have protested that prison conditions are making it impossible to prepare his defense.

42419691,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFNq1,1693818482,Grayscale's Legal Win Versus SEC Makes Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval More Likely: JPMorgan,"It is more likely that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would be forced to approve the spot bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded-fund (ETF) applications from several asset managers after a federal court ruled that the regulator must review its rejection of Grayscale’s attempt to convert the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an ETF, JPMorgan (JPM) said in a report Friday.  “The most important element of the Grayscale vs. SEC court ruling was that the denial by SEC was arbitrary and capricious because the Commission failed to explain its different treatment of similar products i.e., futures-based bitcoin ETFs,” analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote. Grayscale and CoinDesk are both owned by Digital Currency Group (DCG).  The court argued that fraud and manipulation in the spot market posed a similar risk to both futures and spot products because the “spot bitcoin market and CME bitcoin futures market are so tightly correlated,” the report said.  JPMorgan notes that the court ruled there was no justification to allow futures-based bitcoin ETFs but deny spot ETFs. That's highly significant because it implies that for the SEC to defend its denial of Grayscale’s proposal to convert GBTC, “it would have to retroactively withdraw its previous approval of futures-based bitcoin ETFs.”  A retroactive withdrawal would be extremely disruptive and embarrassing for the SEC and therefore appears unlikely, the bank said.  Still, while the Grayscale ruling may bring closer to the eventual approval of a spot bitcoin ETF, “such an approval is unlikely to prove a game changer for the crypto market,” the note said.  Spot bitcoin ETFs have existed for some time outside the U.S., but have failed to attract considerable investor interest, and bitcoin funds overall, both futures-based and physically backed funds, have attracted little investor interest since the second quarter of 2021, the report added.  Spot-based ETFs allow investors to hold their positions indefinitely while eliminating the rollover cost associated with futures ETFs. The crypto market is optimistic that an eventual launch of spot-based ETFs will unlock floodgates to mainstream money.

42419692,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFNs5,1693817872,Bitcoin's Use as Margin Collateral in Crypto Futures Trading Is Growing,"BTC-margined contracts now account for 33% of the total futures open interest, up from 20% in July, according to Glassnode.  The contracts offer a non-linear payoff, bringing traders to their position-liquidation point faster than cash-margined contracts.  Bitcoin (BTC) is unlikely to shed its tag as an unpredictable and volatile asset any time soon because crypto traders are increasingly using the largest cryptocurrency as a margin in futures trading.  Since July, the percentage of bitcoin futures open interest margined with bitcoin has risen to 33% from roughly 20%, according to data tracked by Glassnode. Cash or stablecoin-margined contracts still account for 65% of the total open interest.  Futures are leveraged products, allowing traders to maximize exposure for a deposit at the exchange, known as margin, which is a small percent of the contract size. The exchange provides the rest of the value of the trade. The renewed interest in BTC-margined contracts means potential for volatility-boosting liquidations cascades, according to research provider Blockware Intelligence. That occurs when multiple liquidations – or forced closure of positions due to margin shortage – happen consecutively, causing a rapid price change.  ""Using BTC as collateral for a BTC derivative is effectively a double whammy,"" analysts at Blockware Intelligence said in a weekly newsletter. ""If you're long BTC with BTC posted as collateral, the price going down brings you to your liquidation point faster because the value of your collateral is declining at the same time. ""Leveraging against your BTC during its monetization phase is extremely risky, [as] you can be correct directionally, but volatility can wipe you out regardless.""  Coin-margined contracts are quoted in U.S. dollars, but margined and settled in cryptocurrencies. In other words, the collateral is as volatile as the position, creating a non-linear payoff, where a trader earns less when the market rallies and loses more when the market drops.  So, not only does a long position bleed as bitcoin's dollar-denominated price drops, but the collateral also loses value, compounding losses. That, in turn, results in a relatively quick margin shortfall and potential liquidation.  The trend is worrying in a sense that should coin-margined contracts become dominant, we may see frequent volatility-boosting liquidations cascades. Such events were quite common before September 2021, when coin-margined contracts accounted for more than 50% of the global open interest.  According to Blockware, the renewed interest in such contracts represents a shortage of cash in the market.  ""The spike in this metric over the past few months is curious, it may suggest that traders are running out of cash and are resorting to leveraging against their BTC as the last means of increasing their exposure,"" the analysts said.  Liquidity has been leaving the crypto market for some time. According to CCData, the total market value of all stablecoins contracted by 0.4% to $125 billion in August, the 17th consecutive monthly decline. The market cap of tether (USDT), the world's largest stablecoin by market value, has fallen almost $1 billion to $82.87 billion in the past four weeks, CoinGecko data show.

The sellers’ inability to follow through on their downward pressure hints at some wavering in their conviction. The crucial question now is whether the uncertainty will pave the way for buyers to reclaim higher ground this month. As of the latest data from CoinGecko, PEPE currently trades at $0.000000807186, reflecting a 2.8% increase in the past 24 hours. However, over the past seven days, the coin has experienced a 7.6% decline in value. Price analysts suggest that if the daily candle manages to close above the critical level of 0.00000078, the recent breakdown could be deemed a “bear trap,” that might offer a glimmer of hope for PEPE enthusiasts. A bear trap is a situation in trading where the price of an asset appears to be entering a bearish (downward) trend but then reverses and moves upwards instead. It “traps” or tricks traders who were expecting further price declines into selling their positions, only to see the price rise. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Faces Potential Loss As Bearish Pattern Emerges Challenges Ahead For PEPE While the bullish momentum appears promising, PEPE’s recovery remains constrained within a falling channel pattern that has persisted for the past two months. To gain more confidence in the revival, buyers must breach the upper trendline of this channel. Such a breakout has the potential to catapult the meme coin past the coveted $0.000001 threshold. Total crypto market cap at $1.02 trillion on the daily chart: TradingView.com In a separate report, worrying statistics emerge regarding the health of the PEPE network. Santiment’s latest data reveals an 83% drop in active addresses associated with Pepe (PEPE) over the past quarter. Additionally, both transaction volume and transaction count have experienced a significant downturn. Despite the recent price rally and bullish sentiment, PEPE faces challenges ahead, primarily due to the persistent downward trend within the falling channel pattern. The failure to break free from this pattern could see the meme coin continue its downward trajectory. PEPE seven-day price action. Source: Coingecko User Exodus Spells Trouble For Pepe Coin Date from Santiment cited in the report paints a bleak picture for PEPE as the network grapples with a sharp decline in active users. This alarming 83% decrease in active addresses highlights the waning interest in the cryptocurrency, possibly undermining its long-term viability. Moreover, the decrease in transaction volume and transaction count further compounds the network’s woes. Related Reading: Polygon (MATIC) Drops Below Crucial Level – Will Sellers Exit?

The announcement comes at a time when Shibarium has crossed the 1 million wallet mark, a milestone that underscores its growing adoption and utility. “First of all, congratulations to the ShibArmy for reaching a milestone of 1 million wallets and soon, 1 million transactions. We have achieved—and aim to maintain—our status as one of the fastest and cheapest L2 networks out there,” said Dhairya. Upgrades And Progress On Shibarium One of the most notable updates is the integration of a hosted version of the Blockscout explorer on Shibariumscan. Dhairya emphasized the importance of this development, stating, “This allows our small yet dedicated protocol team to focus on the network and its upgrades, while the fantastic Blockscout team ensures the explorer remains operational and the chain is 100% indexed.” Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Faces Potential Loss As Bearish Pattern Emerges The Blockscout integration also serves as a tool for developers to “Do Your Own Research” (DYOR) and verify new or existing contracts deployed on Shibarium. Dhairya urged developers to make use of the Blockscout contract verification system, as the team plans to promote projects built on top of Shibarium in the near future. He also unveiled the verified WBONE contract. Shibarium has also expanded its token bridge capabilities, adding support for several new tokens, including USDT, USDC, DAI, WBTC, and XFUND. “We are also collaborating with numerous third-party bridges to ensure they can assist in bridging many other tokens into Shibarium,” Dhairya added. Moreover, the Shibarium team plans to renounce the Bone contract and add more validators to the network in the coming week. “Shibarium is open for everyone to develop upon. The SHIB team’s primary focus in the future will be to innovate and build technologies on top of Shibarium, empowering our community to lead a self-sovereign life,” Dhairya concluded. Shiba Inu Price Retracement Could Continue The recent upgrades to Shibarium come amidst a period of retracement for the SHIB token. After peaking at a 4-month high of $0.00001195 on August 12, the meme coin is on a downward trajectory. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Marketing Lead Sends Important Message To SHIB Holders In the 1-day chart, SHIB slipped below the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.00000796 yesterday. This level has served as extremely strong support on the daily chart since mid-August. The drop below the level could now mean that SHIB retraces lower to the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.00000688. At the current price of $0.00000771, this could mean another 10% slide. However, if the bulls surprisingly manage to turn the tide, the price level of $0.00000796 would be the first important step. To retake the mid-August high, SHIB will have to overcome a maze of resistances, notably the 20, 50 and 100-day EMAs, all of which lie ahead of the 50% Fibonacci retracement at $0.00000872. If SHIB manages to overcome this price on a daily basis, it would be a strong bullish sign. Then, the 200-day EMA at $0.00000921 would be another tough challenge.

The price could start a fresh increase if it clears the $6.25 resistance zone. Chainlink token price is showing positive signs above $6.0 against the US dollar. The price is trading above the $6.05 level and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $6.10 on the 4-hour chart of the LINK/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could gain bullish momentum above the $6.25 resistance zone. Chainlink (LINK) Price Eyes Fresh Recovery After a major decline, LINK price found support near the $5.75 zone against the US Dollar. A low was formed near $5.74 and the price is now attempting a recovery wave, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. There was a decent move above the $5.85 and $6.00 levels. LINK is now trading above the $6.05 level and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). However, there are many hurdles on the upside starting with $6.10. Besides, there is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $6.10 on the 4-hour chart of the LINK/USD pair. The current price action suggests that the price is struggling near the trend line and $6.10. The first major resistance is near the $6.25 zone. It is close to the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $7.91 swing high to the $5.74 low. Source: LINKUSD on TradingView.com A clear break above $6.25 may possibly start a fresh increase toward the $6.65 and $6.80 levels. The next major resistance is near the $7.10 level, above which the price could revisit $7.50. Another Decline Losses? If Chainlink’s price fails to climb above the $6.25 resistance level, there could be a downside extension. Initial support on the downside is near the $6.00 level. The next major support is near the $5.75 level, below which the price might test the $5.60 level. Any more losses could lead the price toward the $5.35 level in the near term.

ETH is facing many hurdles near $1,650 and $1,670. Ethereum started a recovery wave from the $1,600 support level. The price is trading below $1,650 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,665 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase unless there is a close above the $1,700 level. Ethereum Price Faces Key Resistance Ethereum’s price extended its decline below the $1,650 support zone. ETH price even spiked below the $1,620 and tested the $1,600 handle, like Bitcoin. A low was formed near $1,600 and the price recently started an upside correction. There was a move above the $1,620 and $1,630 levels. The price climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,748 swing high to the $1,600 low. Ether is still trading below $1,650 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Besides, there is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,665 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $1,650 level and the 100 hourly SMA. The next resistance is near the $1,660 level and the trend line. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,748 swing high to the $1,600 low. Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com A close above the $1,665 level might send the price toward the $1,700 zone. To start a fresh increase, Ethereum must settle above the $1,700 pivot level. The next resistance might be near $1,750. Any more gains might send the price toward the $1,800 resistance. Another Decline in ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $1,665 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,630 level. The first key support is close to $1,600. The next major support is near the $1,580 level. If there is a downside break below $1,580, the price could extend its decline toward the $1,540 level. Any more losses might send the price toward the $1,480 level in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bearish zone.
