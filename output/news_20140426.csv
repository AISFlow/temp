42377174,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6zfdZ,1398548179,BTC China Halts RMB Account Funding From China Merchants Bank,"Chinese bitcoin exchange BTC China has stopped accepting RMB deposits to user accounts from a major bank, revealing the move in a post on its Weibo page.  Management decided to proactively halt deposits from one of the country's largest banks, China Merchants Bank, after the bank posted on its public website that it would no longer allow its customers to engage in bitcoin-related transactions, and said essentially it would require all such businesses to close their accounts.  Withdrawals to China Merchants Bank accounts and transactions with other banks remain unaffected, at least for the moment.  A rough translation of BTC China's Weibo post reads:    ""Due to a notice issued by China Merchants Bank, BTC China, out of consideration for user security and stabilization operations, decided to suspend the credit of accounts with RMB.      For subsequent updates, please pay attention to our website and Twitter, thank you again for your interest and support of BTC China.""    BTC China CEO Bobby Lee said his company had not yet any direct notifications from any of its banking partners, but was ready to act should such information arrive. Apart from the China Merchants Bank website posting, which did not specify any exchange by name, no other banks have stated their intentions as yet.  This followed reports last week that financial institutions were preparing to sever links with bitcoin exchanges, after closed session meetings with People's Bank representatives. Bitcoin value dropped roughly $40 probably as a result, a position from which it is not yet recovered.  Getting serious  The meetings were reportedly more grave in tone than on previous occasions, suggesting the PBOC would soon set stricter rules about how its earlier edicts should be followed. As well as preventing users from funding their bitcoin exchange accounts, the new guidelines could eventually limit their ability to withdraw from bitcoin and litecoin into yuan as well.  Official policy has not actually changed since last December, when the PBOC first expressed its concerns. Different interpretations of what the central bank's rules still permitted, however, allowed exchanges to experiment with other options including funding via personal bank accounts and voucher systems.  Lack of clarity  The issue has become known as the Chinese 'ban-unban' story on forums such as reddit, stemming from the fact that at various stages authorities have met with select groups to discuss policy, which resulted in actions affecting only certain companies, business relationships, or sections of the bitcoin economy (such as deposits to exchange accounts).  The PBOC itself has continued to deny that it will ban bitcoin outright, though it has not made any public statements about how it intends to restrict digital currency use in the country.  CoinDesk will continue to monitor this developing story.

42377183,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6zfsf,1398517326,Many Shibes and Much Talk at San Francisco Dogecoin Conference,"A dogecoin-themed conference held yesterday in San Francisco brought together hundreds of attendees to hear leaders from the altcoin industry, and to just have a good time.  The event, Dogecon SF, was held in the auditorium space at Automattic, the company behind the popular WordPress platform. The conference, organized by Follow the Coin, filled the hall, which was built for a capacity of 350.  Jackson Palmer, the creator of dogecoin, told CoinDesk that over 900 people registered for the event, which was free but encouraged donations.  Palmer, who led the keynote session, told the audience:  “It’s been 138 days since dogecoin was launched. That’s crazy.”  Doge’s astonishing acceptance  That hundreds of people that were present at Dogecon SF, an event that was planned in just a few weeks, is evidence that the altcoin has a ever-growing backing.  During Palmer’s keynote he said that over $150,000 had been transmitted via dogetipbot, the software that allows reddit users to tip each other dogecoin, helping the altcoin become a tipping mechanism in reddit comments and messages.  Palmer also pointed out that more than $100,000 in dogecoin has been raised for various charity efforts, most notably for a NASCAR driver that will compete at Talladega Motor Speedway in a doge-themed car.  “It’s weird, being treated [generously] and [kindly] on the internet,” Palmer quipped.  One doge equals one doge  Dogecoin’s success as an alternative cryptocurrency hasn’t been because of speculative buying and holding of the coin, Palmer told the audience:  “The viability of a digital currency shouldn’t be tied to a dollar amount.”  He discussed the idea that one doge should be thought of as one doge, and that constantly thinking about what a coin is worth in fiat is not going to increase its adoption. “You shouldn’t wake up and worry about what bitcoin is worth in US dollars,” he said.  But other than dogetipbot, there aren’t many other ways to spend doge yet. “We need to build demand for people who want to pay for things in dogecoin,” Palmer added.  Charlie Lee and merged mining  A fireside chat with Palmer and litecoin creator Charlie Lee was one highlight of the event's speaking sessions. It was the litecoin source code that Palmer and co-founder Billy Markus used to create doge.  Recently, Lee took to reddit for a proposal to merge dogecoin and litecoin mining to better protect both coins, an idea that Palmer has disagreed with. The panel primarily consisted of a healthy debate on that subject.  Lee said: “Dogecoin has what I consider a problem with the mining algorithm. I see the hashrate dropping by a lot if the price doesn’t support it.""  Jackson believes that if miners are getting dogecoin and litecoin mining rewards that they will simply sell dogecoin, which he sees as a problem. He admitted:  “I really want to come up with an innovative solution. But I don’t have a solution right now.”  Socializing  It was clear that Dogecon SF, with its free food and beer, carried more of a party-like atmosphere than most cryptocurrency events. It had a photo booth, carnival games and giveaways.  Sponsors such as Expresscoin gave away rocket popsicles as a token of doge’s ‘to the moon’ slogan that refers to its quick success. A few people wore costumes, and one attendee even brought a Shiba Inu dog, a real-life version of dogecoin’s cartoon mascot.  With no charge for attendance and plenty of sponsored party supplies, Dogecon SF was considered a success by many attendees.  Andreas Antonopoulos  also spoke at the event, summarising dogecoin's out-of-the-blue triumph and its subsequent ability to gather a strong community:  “Value is not derived from who created it, but who is using it. A currency with a funny dog has value. And that is because you think it has value.”  Images via CoinDesk",POSITIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | DOGE | LTC | MINING | SHIB,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/04/26/many-shibes-and-much-talk-at-san-francisco-dogecoin-conference,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5c2d96e598c29be608001c63fe629eb1f471bd98-870x500.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397583,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbD5R8,1398514192,Is it Too Late to Get Involved in Bitcoin?,"So, you've only just learned about bitcoin, you've seen that people have become millionaires through investing in it. Your question is: ""Can I still do the same, or has the bitcoin boat sailed?""  Unfortunately there's no simple answer to this. Can you still make millions from bitcoin? Possibly. Has the bitcoin boat sailed? Certainly not.  Bitcoin, and digital currency as a concept, is still very young. Created just five years ago, it's still trying to find its feet and its price is suffering rather wild volatility. On top of this, recent company failures have left a lot of bitcoiners out of pocket.  That said, there are plenty of people who have made a lot of money from bitcoin, having invested in the early days and watched the price rocket since then.  Those who invested two years ago, when the price was $5 a pop, have seen their investment increase a sickening 9,560% to $483 per bitcoin (at the time of writing). In order to enjoy the same percentage return over the next two years, the price of bitcoin would have to increase from $483 to around $46,500.  Sounds ridiculous, right? Actually, some people don't think it's that far fetched at all.  Bullish bitcoiners  A number of extremely bullish bitcoin price predictions have been voiced over the past year by some pretty notable commentators.  Ex-Facebook executive Chamath Palihapitiya kicked things off in May last year, writing in a piece for Bloomberg stating that each bitcoin could go on to be worth more than $400,000, provided it establishes itself as a “useful reserve currency”.  The Winklevoss twins (of the Facebook lawsuit fame) said in November that they believe the price could go on to increase 100-fold, with the market cap reaching $400bn (the market cap is currently $5.8bn).  A few weeks later, a report from Wall Street analysts Gil Luria and Aaron Turner predicted that the price of one bitcoin could increase to almost $100,000.  Titled ‘Bitcoin: Intrinsic Value as Conduit for Disruptive Payment Network Technology’, the report predicted the price of bitcoin could increase to 10-100 times its value at the time, which was around $1,000.  Political and financial pundit Max Keiser has been championing bitcoin for years, but in December he suggested it wouldn't be long before the price hit $5,000.    As predicted, 2014 will see hedge funds and PE funds (like Fortress) enter BTC space. Hello $5,000!      — Max Keiser (@maxkeiser) December 31, 2013    CoinDesk polled its readers in January and found 56% of the respondents believed the price of bitcoin will reach a whopping $10,000 this year. Of the 'young people' quizzed for a separate survey by Wired, 42% said they believe bitcoin is a lasting currency and 30% consider investing in or mining bitcoins as safer than the more traditional stock market.  While it seems there are plenty of people flying the flag for bitcoin, it's worth noting there is an endless supply of pessimists who think digital currency will crash and burn in the not-so-distant future.  Bearish naysayers  Warren Buffett  recently nailed his colours to the mast, telling CNBC in no uncertain terms that he thinks bitcoin is an utter waste of time.  ""Stay away from it. It's a mirage, basically,"" the billionaire investor said, adding that ""the idea that it has some huge intrinsic value is just a joke"".  American economist Paul Krugman voiced similar views in an opinion piece he wrote for the New York Times back in December called 'Bitcoin is Evil'. He said he was ""deeply unconvinced"" that bitcoin could actually work as a form of currency and he doesn't think it works as a ""store of value"".  Sir Bob Geldof followed suit shortly after, damning bitcoin by saying digital currency ""simply won't work"". However, Max Keiser told the world not to pay any attention to the singer's protestations, claiming that asking his opinion on bitcoin is a ""worthless exercise"", akin to ""asking a blind man his opinion on a Turner"".  American economist Nouriel Roubini, who anticipated the collapse of the US housing market and the worldwide recession that started in 2008, is also not bitcoin believer.  He has taken to his Twitter feed to label it an ""irrational useless bubble fad"", a ""Ponzi game"" and a ""lousy store of value"".    So Bitcoin isn't a currency. It is btw a Ponzi game and a conduit for criminal/illegal activities. And it isn't safe given hacking of it.      — Nouriel Roubini (@Nouriel) March 9, 2014    How to get involved  If the above ranting hasn't put you off getting involved in bitcoin, it's likely you're now wondering how best to start.  You've probably heard that bitcoins are generated through a process called mining, which involves the use of computer hardware to solve complicated mathematical equations. In the past, people could use their own PCs to mine bitcoins, but things have now evolved so that to make any significant return, you have to first invest in application-specific hardware that can cost thousands of dollars.  Most people are choosing, instead, to get involved in bitcoin simply by buying some of the digital currency via online exchanges, such as Bitstamp, BTC-e and BTC China, or marketplaces such as LocalBitcoins.com.  [post-quote]  Once you're in possession of some bitcoins, you then have to make a decision about what to do with them – do you stash them away and hope for the best, do you spend them or do you do a bit of both?  That's completely up to you, but bitcoin's value will only increase if its popularity increases, and for this to happen people need to use it, to spend it and to take advantage of the benefits it provides.  By all means, store some in a bitcoin wallet, but don't just leave all of them in there, gathering virtual dust. Create another wallet that you use for spending. Make some purchases, test it out, explore how easy it is. Tell your friends about it and give your investment the best possible chance of blossoming into the millions you're praying for.  It's important that you treat bitcoin like you would any high-risk investment – there's a chance you could end up making a lot of money, but there's also the chance you could lose everything. So, just be sensible and don't invest more than you can afford to lose.  For now, the bottom line is that digital currency isn't going to go away any time soon. So, when are you going to take the plunge?",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Emily Spaven,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/04/26/is-it-too-late-to-get-involved-in-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1070ba1643c518d43454b056732d1a47aca6bcfa-1000x750.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42375630,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw9NoD,1398510197,Bitcoin's Role in Combatting Inflation,"The economies of the developing world will feel the earliest and greatest impact from bitcoin. Not only are bitcoin's enormous benefits very personal, they are also contextual depending on your political geography.  Individuals residing in high-inflation countries with relatively sufficient Internet access as a percentage of population do seek refuge in bitcoin.  The worst offenders depriving their subjects of monetary stability or a reasonable – albeit 'coerced' – store of value are the dictatorial regimes in politically tumultuous countries like Belarus, Sudan, Syria, Iran, Ethiopia, Malawi, Venezuela, Burundi, Yemen, and Tanzania.  Incidentally, those countries also form the top 10 country list for annual inflation rate according to the World Bank and International Monetary Fund data for 2012.  High-inflation promotes bitcoin  Topping the list is Ukraine's neighbour Belarus, with an annual inflation rate of 59.2%. Ruled by President Alexander Lukashenko since 1994, Belarus is known as Europe's last dictatorship. While shocking, that inflation rate is actually down from 2011, when a financial crisis triggered a peak rate of 109%.  Venezuela  comes in at #7 worldwide, with an annual inflation rate of 21.1%. Price controls, capital flight, food shortages, and electricity blackouts are now pushing Venezuela toward the brink.  The Heritage Foundation's Index of Economic Freedom highlights the massive potential for bitcoin in a world of abusive monetary authorities.  Not surprisingly, these countries also rank very low for Internet penetration as a percentage of country's total population when compared to US at 81.0% and UK at 87.0%.  Internet penetration as percentage of total population  Where it becomes interesting is when we look at high-inflation monetary regimes coupled with strong and growing Internet penetration. Notably, the countries with the highest inflation rates that also have reasonable access to Internet connectivity tend to be relatively active on the bitcoin network of active global nodes.  Belarus with 46.9% Internet penetration, Venezuela with 44.0%, India with 12.6%, Vietnam with 39.5%, and Turkey with 45.1% are all disproportionately high outlets for active bitcoin nodes (ranking #51, #50, #54, #48, and #45 respectively). These countries are also in the top rankings for annual inflation with rates exceeding 9% or 10% during 2012.  Argentina  demonstrates the prime example of bitcoin solving an issue of monetary justice related to persistent debasement of the national currency (the peso).  The country has merely 55.8% Internet penetration as a percentage of total population and yet ranks #26 in terms of active bitcoin nodes globally. Clearly, Argentinians have a strong desire to protect their long-term purchasing power and regain control over their monetary lives.  High inflation rates coupled with high Internet connectivity tends to lead to bitcoin.  Graphic: World map of 24-hour relative average utilization of IPv4 addresses observed using ICMP ping requests as part of the Internet Census of 2012 (Carna Botnet), June - October 2012.  Key: from red (high), to yellow, green (average), light blue, and dark blue (low).  Increased purchasing power  Certainly, bitcoin exhibits short term volatility as a young medium of exchange attempting to find its footing against the tide of sporadic liquidity, bank account closures, and government-threatened bans.     In the intermediate term, bitcoin's predictable scarcity makes it a sought-after commodity when compared to fiat currencies. Bitcoin's price chart is a story of price appreciation, or increased purchasing power, for the decentralized currency and its global community of users.  Time horizon is important and indeed bitcoin can be seen as either currency or commodity, as the IRS has recently affirmed.  Measured over two years in USD, bitcoin exhibits tremendous increases in purchasing power and, in that way, bitcoin is similar to gold. Another way of examining bitcoin purchasing power is to express the gold price in BTC. It is rare that a national, or centralized, fiat currency with predictable depreciation would retain or increase its purchasing power in such a way.  Split appeal  We can kid ourselves that the US or EU won't see the types of inflation rates that we see from the world's worst offenders because, for now, the USD and the euro have privileged reserve currency status and this mitigates or absorbs the hidden abuse.  The primary appeal of bitcoin in the developed world is the retention of some remnants of privacy and the occasional opportunity to challenge the monopolistic payment giants like VISA and PayPal. Not so in the the still developing regions where other bitcoin attributes take precedence.  In addition to bitcoin as a digital store of value across all jurisdictions, bitcoin's resiliency to shutdown and immunity from confiscation lie at the heart of its monetary justice properties.  Moreover, fear not deflation, for deflation is the friend of liberty.  As economist Jörg Guido Hülsmann argues, a much-feared deflationary spiral would not prove fatal to the lives and welfare of the general population. Rather, it would destroy ""essentially those companies and industries that live a parasitical existence at the expense of the rest of the economy, and which owe their existence to our present money system.""  Or more bluntly, ""deflation is a mortal enemy to the heavily indebted state and its embedded parasites, but it is a friend to the saver and to anyone with a positive net worth.""

42397578,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbD5NC,1398506416,"How We Mined More Than 100,000 Dogecoins in One Week","As bitcoin mining increasingly becomes more of a professional pursuit, hobbyists and newcomers have turned their attention to scrypt mining.  So, at CoinDesk, we wondered, ‘why not try scrypt mining ourselves?’  Watch the video to see how well we fared:  [youtube id=""Y0ueyiEUKZo"" width=""620"" height=""360""]  .  We got our hands on a Gridseed G-Blade miner, one of the first scrypt miners in the market to use ASIC chips. ASIC chips have been used to mine bitcoin for over a year, now they are making their way into scrypt mining.  That’s making scrypt even more attractive to newbies.  MinerEU  is the European distributor for the China-based manufacturer Gridseed. CEO and co-founder Jing Wei explains why it is easier to get into ASIC scrypt mining:  “The clear advantage of scrypt ASIC mining is lower power consumption. It’s scalable: you can even set up a mining farm at home. It’s also very easy to set it up. We have streamlined the process. [...] In a few minutes you can connect all the parts together.”  It is easier and faster to make money from altcoins rather than investing in expensive and industrial bitcoin mining equipment. Mining equipment manufacturers have already announced refined scrypt-mining equipment.  While Gridseed G-Blade is one of the first to be launched on the market, KnCMiner has already announced their plans to launch their scrypt miner Titan.  Mining Adventures at CoinDesk  Each Gridseed G-Blade miner has two boards with 40 GC335 ASIC chips on each one. This $1,600 miner promises a total hashrate of 5.2M.  We brought two of the two-blade miners into the office. Including installing the relevant software, it took us about an hour to set them up. But, now that we’ve done it once, next time would definitely be quicker.  Depending on what you decide to mine, the return on investment of these miners is three to six months. We decided to mine dogecoin and managed 100,000 doge with two miners in a week.  That’s not a bad start to our scrypt mining career, but it’s certainly possible to improve on the ROI by using the multipool.  Wei says:  “In theory the smart switching technology should give you a higher return that mining one type of alternative coin, but the problem with that is the switching process. If we switch it over from one coin to another, the calculation power will be lost during the transition.”  While we’ve parted with the miners, we're still working out what to do with our $58 worth of dogecoin – suggestions welcome in the comments below.",POSITIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BTC | DOGE | LTC | MINING,Roop Gill,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/04/26/how-we-mined-more-than-100000-dogecoins-in-one-week,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/26df42b32096a21255f05f4cee4a2c21a32570b8-1000x639.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
