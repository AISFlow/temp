35686238,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=651541,1730759422,Bitcoin Mining Costs Spike To Nearly $50K As Miners Look To AI For Survival,"Bitcoin mining is now a highly competitive industry that’s not just expensive but technology-intensive as well. Individuals interested in joining the growing mining industry must invest in a specialized computer system, steady internet, reliable energy supply, and a good amount of skill to manage the process. Related Reading: Why One Analyst Says Now’s The Time To Buy XRP—Before It Hits $14 As such, miners often turn to credit facilities to fund their operations. Today, mining costs continue to grow, with some experts saying that costs have skyrocketed to $49,500 as of the second quarter. CoinShares reports that the second quarter data is $2,300 more than the first quarter when mining costs average $47,200. The investment company further explained that the miners’ cash expenses average $85,900, and prediction costs amount to $96,100. Failing to secure a credit line is now a common complaint among BTC miners, while others say rising interest rates worsen their situation. BTC Miners Fail To Capitalize On Recent Price Rallies Bitcoin mining is inextricably linked to the digital asset’s extreme volatility. For example, many of our miners failed to capitalize on the rumors of Bitcoin ETFs circulating in late 2023. In January 2024, the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) finally approved the applications of at least 11 ETFs, pushing Bitcoin to breach the $70k level. The sudden increase in the asset’s valuation only showed that the mining industry is sensitive to these price movements, especially after the halving of rewards took effect. Today, many mining analysts are looking at models that can anticipate the asset’s continuing increase in hash rate. Current models used by most miners expect the rate to hit 765 EH/s. Time For BTC Mining To Embrace Alternative Energy Sources? One of the complaints against BTC mining is that it hurts the environment due to the massive energy requirements, not to mention the carbon footprint it emits. Experts say that if miners use alternative energy sources, we can reduce our carbon footprint by 63% by 2050. Miners should be ready to embrace these alternative energy sources since expenses grow as the hash rate increases. Related Reading: Solana DeFi Momentum Soars With $5.7 Billion Locked In Q3 As Costs Rise, Some Bitcoin Miners Turn To AI Since mining efficiency is starting to fall, many miners are looking for ways to augment their revenues. For example, many experienced miners are holding tokens instead of mining them. Others turn to AI-related solutions as a potential source of revenue. It’s safe to say that the BTC mining industry is entering a new phase. When planning and moving forward, miners and other stakeholders must consider the challenges, from costs to compliance to competition. As costs continue to increase, miners must find solutions and options to remain profitable.

Income derived from USDG’s reserves will be shared among the initial Global Dollar Network partners, which are Anchorage Digital, Bullish, Galaxy Digital, Kraken, Nuvei, Paxos and Robinhood.  A group of heavy hitters in the cryptocurrency space are backing a new, regulation-focused stablecoin, the Global Dollar (USDG), which aims to return yield earned on its reserve assets to participants who help accelerate its adoption.  Dubbed the Global Dollar Network, the original partners are Anchorage Digital, Bullish (the owner of CoinDesk), Galaxy Digital, Kraken, Nuvei, Paxos and Robinhood.  The USDG stablecoin is issued out of Singapore by Paxos, and is “substantively compliant” with the Monetary Authority of Singapore's upcoming stablecoin framework, according to a press release.  “This is meant to really be a community token,” said Paxos CEO Charles Cascarilla in an interview. “Anybody can join the Global Dollar Network and accrue rewards for activity. We're distributing something like 97% of the economics. That's a big difference from how other stablecoins have been set up and created to date.”  Stablecoins are a big business which has been dominated by two giants, Tether – whose {{USDT}} is the largest stablecoin by a wide margin – and the next biggest, Circle and its {{USDC}}. Unlike the new USDG, both Tether and Circle retain all the interest from reserves. There are other yield-sharing stablecoins as well as some interesting protocol-level innovation from the likes of the M^0 project.  Income generated from USDG’s reserves, which like many stablecoins are U.S. Treasuries, will be shared out among participants based on the ways these firms can create connectivity and liquidity, Cascarilla said.  “The way we have set this up is that the participants are being rewarded for activity that helps grow the utility of the network,” he said. “That could be for a number of activities; different participants can be rewarded in different ways, because not everyone does the same thing, and that's actually what makes a thriving ecosystem.”  By rewarding participant companies rather than end users of the platform, the USDG stablecoin is available in the U.S. via the footprint of the distribution partners, such as Anchorage, which operates in all 50 U.S. states.

35682148,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=651508,1730754038,"Bitcoin Price Poised For $75,000 As Trump-Harris Race Tightens: QCP","The Bitcoin price has posted five consecutive red daily candles since it stopped just short of its all-time high at $73,620 last Tuesday. As a result, the BTC price has fallen by around 7%. This decline is evident on the weekly chart, which shows a major bearish weekly candle – a gravestone doji. Chartered Market Technician (CMT) Aksel Kibar noted via X, “BTCUSD weekly candle can look similar to GOLD,” and explained that it indicates a reversal is on the horizon. However, he added, “It is not dependable as an individual candle. Best to combine it with a following weak candle as a confirmation of trend reversal. The market narrative is that the bulls attempt to push to new highs over the session but the bears push the price action to near the open by the session close. Bitcoin To Hit $75,000 By End Of November? Despite this, Singapore-based crypto trading firm QCP Capital remains bullish in its latest investor note, highlighting significant shifts in both political prediction markets and the BTC derivatives market. Related Reading: Spot ETFs Fail To Ignite Bitcoin Growth – Analyst According to QCP Capital, the odds on the decentralized prediction market Polymarket have “moved closer to actual poll estimates,” with Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump “locked in a tight race.” While Polymarket still favors Trump at 55%, this marks a decrease from 66% a week ago, indicating a narrowing margin that aligns more closely with mainstream polling data. The firm also noted a cautious sentiment prevailing in the cryptocurrency market. The “sideways price action over the weekend” and a decrease in leveraged perpetual futures positioning—from $30 billion to $26 billion across exchanges—suggest that traders are adopting a wait-and-see approach. This pullback may be due to uncertainties surrounding macroeconomic factors or the upcoming election. Despite the current market hesitancy, QCP Capital sees potential for significant upward movement in Bitcoin’s price. The firm questioned whether this is “the calm before a break from the multi-month range and push toward all-time highs.” Supporting this outlook, QCP observed an increase in topside positioning with substantial buying of end-November $75,000 call options since last Friday. This surge in call options at that strike price suggests that traders are positioning for a substantial rally by the end of November. Related Reading: How To Trade Bitcoin During The US Election, Expert Reveals Additionally, the firm highlighted increased activity in options tied to the election date. “Election-date options positions are also rising,” QCP noted, with Friday implied volatility exceeding 87%, even as realized volatility remains at 40%. The elevated implied volatility indicates that options traders are anticipating significant price swings around the election period. Looking ahead, QCP Capital expects Bitcoin’s spot price to remain range-bound until the US election results provide more clarity. The firm stated that they “expect spot to chop around this range until we get more clarity on the election results this week,” adding that “a Trump win is likely to cause a knee-jerk reaction higher, and vice versa if Kamala wins.” At press time, BTC traded at $68,852.

Crypto owners represent a diverse and forward-looking demographic, particularly in swing states such as Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Nationwide, 68% of crypto owners are Millennials and Gen Z, and 48% are racially diverse. In states that will decide the presidency, more than 4 million voters are crypto owners, making them a significant factor in determining the outcome of this election.  A recent poll from the Digital Chamber shows one in seven likely voters (16%) identify as part of the crypto voting bloc. This is a bipartisan group that sees crypto policy as a key issue. For example, four in 10 Black voters say crypto is “very” or “extremely” important in deciding who to support in 2024, underscoring the broad appeal of crypto policy beyond traditional political divides.  There is bipartisan agreement that the government should prioritize designing policies that encourage growth and also protect consumer freedoms. A majority of both Republicans and Democrats say that supporting the crypto industry should be at least a medium-level priority for the next president and Congress, with nearly one in three Democrats and over one in four Republicans believing that it should be a ""high"" or ""very high"" priority. In fact, four in five U.S. adults say crypto policy should be at least moderately important for government officials, indicating broad national support for action on this issue.  Candidates who recognize the importance of crypto voters have a significant opportunity to engage a growing and motivated constituency by advocating for policies that support innovation while ensuring consumer protection. Crypto voters are looking for more than vague promises. They want clear, actionable plans that acknowledge crypto technology’s potential to transform finance, promote economic inclusion, and create new opportunities. By embracing this balanced approach, candidates can tap into a broad, bipartisan base of voters who are eager for leadership that fosters economic freedom and technological advancement.  Stand With Crypto, our advocacy group, held a successful tour through five swing states — AZ, MI, NV, WI, PA — and Washington, DC, where we engaged with crypto advocates, voters, policymakers, and local crypto founders at concerts, tailgates, and crypto networking events. We also conducted voter registration at these high-turnout events — over 500,000 people have engaged with SWC's voter registration or candidate research tools.  The response has been clear: the electorate is ready for more decisive leadership on crypto policy. Our voter registration and education drives have shown that crypto enthusiasts are not only passionate but also eager to make their voices heard at the ballot box. SWC's state chapter presidents, who have been heavily involved in the crypto space in their respective states for several years, have played a vital role in mobilizing their communities and advocating for sensible crypto policies that balance innovation with regulation. As one of our champions in Arizona said, ""[we're] ensuring our community is informed, empowered, and ready to shape the future.""  While SWC's 2024 election engagement is already impressive,we're just getting started. After amassing 1.8 million advocates in a year and a half, we're looking to grow to 4 million passionate crypto enthusiasts by 2026.  Crypto voters are a force to be reckoned with in 2024 and have had a demonstrable influence on policy positions for incumbents and challengers alike. Since Stand With Crypto began tracking, we’ve counted 355 pro-crypto candidates in Congressional races, with 291 having shifted from having no stance on crypto to a positive one, and over 300 having supported at least one pro-crypto bill. Candidates nationwide have made more than 1,900 pro-crypto statements, proving that this issue is gaining traction across the political spectrum.  In this election, the crypto vote could be the difference between winning and losing. Crypto voters are here, they’re engaged, and they are ready to shape the future. Smart candidates are taking notice.

42373424,0XGGWk56kaPxudnYllDVr9,1730750615,'There's No Catch': Bitcoin Mining Startup Promises Free Money to Renewable Energy Companies,"Bitcoin mining firm Sangha Renewables aims to help renewable energy companies start their own bitcoin mines.  Green power producers often struggle with stranded energy and are even sometimes forced to pay the market to take excess electricity.  Sangha is closing a 19.9 MW deal to open its first facility in West Texas; the operation is projected to generate 900 bitcoin over the next 10 years.  What if renewable energy companies mined bitcoin?  That's essentially the question that Spencer Marr, the charismatic 37-year-old president of bitcoin {{BTC}} mining firm Sangha Renewables, asked himself at the tail end of the 2017 crypto bull market, in what he describes as a eureka moment.  Today, his idea is one step closer to becoming reality, with his firm set to sign a 19.9 megawatt (MW) deal — enough power to energize about 4,000 homes — with a major renewable energy company in West Texas. And he does not plan to stop there. ""We're talking about gigantic companies,"" Marr told CoinDesk during a series of interviews. ""We're now getting third, fourth, fifth meetings with them.""  The pitch? Help the company turn otherwise wasted electrons into valuable digital currency. The hope? For every independent power producer to eventually adopt a similar business model. It's no easy task. Giant energy companies are extremely conservative by nature, and slow to adopt new technologies.  ""Bitcoin is still this exotic thing they don't understand. 'And what if it goes to zero?' But that's changing with the ETF,"" Marr said, referencing the spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds that launched in the U.S. in January with support from major Wall Street firms. ""Now they see that BlackRock is involved, and it changes their perception.""  Not only could bitcoin mining upend how the power business works, but the adoption of the technology, at scale, could eventually create a new way of tracking energy prices, according to Marr. ""Just as Brent provides a global index for the price of crude oil, I think bitcoin mining will, over time, create a global index for the price of electricity,"" said Marr, who has a background in law and helped New York City increase its renewable energy systems.  To spur interest, Sangha has moved away — at least for now — from trying to convince energy producers to run bitcoin mines themselves. Instead, the negotiations are now about giving Sangha exclusive rights to purchase the electricity and operate the mine, without the power producers needing to put up any cash.  ""In a lot of conversations, they'll be like, 'Wait, so what's the catch?'"" Marr said. ""We tell them there's no catch. This is real.""  Turning wasted energy into crypto profits  One of the constraints large renewable energy companies often face is trapped energy — they produce electricity that nobody can consume.  A wind farm, for example, may generate a lot of electricity on a windy night — right when everyone is asleep and consumption is lowest. Unlike other commodities, electricity is instantaneous; for the most part, it must still be consumed in the moment, since, even though the cost to store that power in batteries has come down, it's still too expensive to be used at scale by the industry. In many cases, the renewable firms are forced to pay the market to take their energy from them, meaning that the excess electricity turns out to be a net negative for these companies.  Transmitting electricity from one place to another is also tricky. Not only is energy lost in the process, but most of the U.S. electrical grid is over 50 years old, and revamping it is a costly task that involves numerous stakeholders with competing interests.  ""The grid was designed for stable energy generation in proximity to where it would be consumed,"" Mike Cohen, CEO of Pow.re, a bitcoin mining company that makes infrastructure investments in renewable energy grids, told CoinDesk. ""Wind and solar are geographically dependent on areas where production conditions are right.""  This is where bitcoin mining, Marr realized, can provide a profitable solution. If a solar plant, or a wind farm, has the ability to convert, nearly instantly, its excess electricity into bitcoin instead of selling it at a loss, renewable energy companies could significantly boost their revenue. That, in turn, would make the financing of new green energy projects more palatable, and reduce the industry's need for government subsidies.  Contrary to other types of data centers, like artificial intelligence clusters, which need almost 100% uptime, bitcoin mines can be turned on and off with a flick of a switch when the cost of electricity gets too high for the operation to remain profitable.  Spun up in July 2020, the West Texas solar plant — operated by ""one of the top five energy companies globally,"" Marr told CoinDesk without disclosing the firm's name — has been forced to sell 10.1% of its total energy generation at a loss, according to a Sangha pitch deck. But the bitcoin mine, once it goes live in spring of 2025, is designed to create a price floor by absorbing that excess energy and boost the site's revenue by 3.7%.  With bitcoin mining's use of energy being a hot topic for debate, the deal would be sort of a vindication for the industry, potentially providing a proof-of-concept that mining can be a legitimate tool for the development of renewable energy in the U.S.  The folks at Sangha aren't the only ones working on this either. There's Satoshi Energy, for example, a firm that develops mining sites for energy companies and then partners the companies up with experienced bitcoin miners, which then run the operations.  ""We've had conversations with [the Sangha team] in the past and appreciate their contributions to the growth of the Bitcoin ecosystem,"" Andrew Myers, the firm's founder, told CoinDesk. ""Welcome to West Texas!""  Pushing renewable energy companies to operate their own bitcoin mines is ""not a totally new idea, but basing an entire business on it in the U.S. is likely innovative,"" Taras Kulyk, the CEO of Synteq Digital, a firm that provides hardware and infrastructure needs for bitcoin miners, told CoinDesk. ""Bhutan, Australia, and Ethiopia are all jurisdictions where this [kind of effort] is active that we're aware of and have helped on.""  'Welcome to West Texas!'  Marr is acutely aware that the West Texas facility is just a pilot project, and the road ahead is still long. ""We're not looking to just do this one deal and go home,"" he said. The energy company has other locations in need for that kind of infrastructure — and its competitors are interested, too, Marr said. ""We're proving that we have what it takes to go the distance.""  However, the project won't be scaling up immediately due to regulatory reasons. ""You can't go past 20 megawatts without needing a bunch of special permissions that take longer to get,"" Marr said. ""Pending final approval, we can go up to 110 megawatts, but we can't get that started until July of 2026."" For context, 20 MW is enough to power 4,000 homes, according to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), the Lone Star State's electrical grid operator.  Assuming the deal goes through, Sangha will, through a series of subsidiaries, own the miner and purchase electricity from the energy company, but the idea, according to Marr, is for the energy company to eventually vertically integrate the operation and mine the bitcoin itself — with Sangha acting in an advisory capacity. ""They're open-minded about that possibility in the future, but they're not ready for it yet,"" Marr said.  The operation is projected to bring in $42 million in revenue in the first 12 months, and mine roughly 900 bitcoin over the next 10 years, according to the pitch deck. It will have access to electricity for anywhere between 2.8 cents and 3.2 cents per kilowatt-hour on a 30-year lease, meaning that investors will be able to acquire bitcoin at a 25% to 50% discount. ""This will basically stay true over time regardless of the absolute value of bitcoin at any given moment,"" Marr said. For comparison, B Riley Securities recently said that the estimated average power costs for the sector is around 4.5 cents per kilowatt-hour.  Part of the pitch is that the energy company itself doesn't have to pay for anything. Sangha is raising $10.7 million from investors of all stripes — small funds or high net worth individuals with interests in real estate, energy, bitcoin mining or crypto in general. A bank will provide an additional $25 million loan secured against the project's assets, like its mining equipment and electrical infrastructure.  Meanwhile, Sangha profits from fees at various stages of the project development, including construction management, the overseeing of the site, the asset management and ownership distributions.  The firm is set to finalize the contracts for the mine by Nov. 30, Marr said. Construction should begin in January 2025, and the operation should come online in April or May of the same year.  Creating a global electricity index  What does it mean for the future of bitcoin mining — and the renewable energy industry — if Marr is right?  The Sangha co-founder's theory is that, down the line, if energy providers all over the world begin operating their own bitcoin mines, the electricity market will radically change and go global.  ""Picture wheat, or oil or gold. … There's a physical product, you can put it in a shipping container, and therefore it's easy to trade it on an international scale regardless of where it is extracted,"" Marr said. ""Electricity hasn't been capable of this because its production and consumption is local. There's no such thing as generating an electron in Texas and selling it in China.""  Bitcoin changes the game, according to Marr, because miners have the option of refining local electricity into a digital commodity that can then be traded on a global network. ""The market doesn't give a sh*t where a specific bitcoin is mined,"" Marr said.  In other words, it's not so much storing electricity like in a battery, but converting it into something new, which has different properties — an alchemical process, according to Marr. And as the bitcoin network scales, energy providers will become increasingly aware of the asymmetry between the local value and the global value (via bitcoin) of the electricity they generate.  ""In theory, we could trade electricity [intercontinentally] in microseconds, because firms will constantly be determining where their electricity is being valued the highest,"" Marr said.  Marr's claim might sound bold and futuristic, yet it's important to know that other parts of the energy sector have already dipped their toes into bitcoin mining — for example, oil and gas companies have been looking into incorporating bitcoin mining to reduce the so-called flaring of natural gas since at least 2019.  So how does one calculate the global price of electricity? Turns out, according to Marr, it's remarkably simple, if using bitcoin mining metrics.  ""You could do it at a machine level, at a fleet-wide level or at a network level,"" Marr said. ""But you take the hash price [a measure of mining profitability], divide it by miner efficiency and you immediately derive your revenue per megawatt-hour.""  CORRECTION (Nov. 4, 2024, 21:09 UTC): Sangha Renewables currently aims to get exclusive rights to buy electricity from renewable energy companies and operate the bitcoin mines itself.

42373441,0XGGWk56kaPxudnYllDWhj,1730750400,U.S. Election Betting: Polymarket 'Manipulation' Claims Miss the Mark,"Mainstream media reports have speculated that Donald Trump's odds on Polymarket are being manipulated for political purposes.  Experts in prediction markets interviewed by CoinDesk saw little to no evidence of such manipulation and said any attempts to rig prices would likely be short-lived.  The mainstream media discourse about Polymarket sounds like Donald Trump complaining about the 2020 presidential election. Both jump to the conclusion that the thing is rigged.  ""A French gambler’s $50m of bets inflated Trump’s odds — and is threatening democracy"" gasped a headline in the U.K. Independent newspaper. The Wall Street Journal and New York Times have been comparatively measured in tone, but also gave airtime to the theory that someone has been manipulating Polymarket to influence turnout and morale or give Trump an excuse to challenge the results should he lose again.  It is true that Polymarket has been signaling a higher probability for the Republican candidate defeating Kamala Harris on Tuesday than forecasters and other prediction markets. Polymarket also confirmed to the Times that a single French national controls several accounts that have been making large bets on Trump winning. That trader told the Journal he had ""absolutely no political agenda"" and was just trying to make money.  For its part, Polymarket told the Times it had found no evidence of manipulation. And several experts in prediction markets interviewed by CoinDesk said they saw little if any.  First of all, the French whale's use of multiple accounts suggests an attempt to minimize slippage, or prices moving against a trader placing a large order.  ""If the goal was to move the price, you'd do the opposite,"" said Flip Pidot, co-founder and CEO of American Civics Exchange, an over-the-counter dealer in political futures contracts. ""Instead of having several accounts trading strategically with limit orders, you'd just keep plowing money in blindly and let yourself get filled at worse and worse prices, since that would be optimal if your goal was to artificially inflate the price.""  If someone did try to manipulate Polymarket for political reasons, they would be unlikely to succeed more than temporarily, experts told CoinDesk. (A Fortune article alleged a different sort of manipulation — wash trading — that appears to be driven by users trying to earn airdrops of a potential future Polymarket token.)  Expected value  First, there is the concept of “expected value,"" where investors take advantage of a trade that would be profitable in the long term.  At one point Thursday, for example, it cost 33 cents apiece on Polymarket to place a single wager on Harris winning the election. Each share pays out $1 (in USDC, a stablecoin or cryptocurrency that usually trades one-to-one with U.S. dollars) if she does and zero if not, so the price indicated the market at that time believed she had a 33% chance of winning.  If her true probability of winning were actually, say, 50-50, that looks like free money to traders. It's generally a good and profitable idea to buy half-dollars for one-third-dollars, so you'd expect traders to swoop in and buy at the discounted price. As more and more of them rush in, the price dislocation tends to disappear.  Put simply: If 33% odds are too low for Harris, bargain hunters will fix that problem.  ""It's not as if there's a shortage of cash in America to take advantage of a bad price,"" said Ciaran Murray, CEO and founder of Olas Protocol, a project that is trying to reinvent the news media using prediction markets.  (Polymarket blocks U.S. IP addresses to comply with a regulatory settlement, but crafty American traders have been using VPNs to get around the geofencing.)  And, it should be noted, in the last few days Harris has climbed to 39.6% as of Monday morning in New York (still leaving Trump at 60.5% and in a large lead).  Big firms' participation  According to Mike van Rossum, CEO of quantitative trading firm Folkvang Trading, Trump's outperformance on Polymarket has also coincided with increased participation on Polymarket from larger trading firms — the kind one would expect to pounce on an obvious trade.  “To effectively trade this you do need quite a lot of infrastructure around poll/reporting data per (swing) state and such, and as the election comes up you need to digest incoming data to adjust your odds,” van Rossum told CoinDesk.  “Big trading firms in traditional markets definitely do this since the election will certainly have a big effect on the rest of the economy [and] they can trade in size (equities, commodities, interest rates, etc).”  Further, buying shares on prediction markets is not the only ""Trump trade"" that has been popular lately. In the stock market, private prison and cryptocurrency companies have been among the beneficiaries of bets that the GOP nominee will win.  “From what I can see the Polymarket prices seem to be wrapping up the views of smart money pretty well,” said Koleman Strumpf, an economics professor at Wake Forest University in North Carolina. “Wall Street traders on the far deeper and more liquid equities markets are trading in a way that reflects the slight edge we see at Polymarket.”  Liquidity  While most of the speculation about manipulation has focused on Trump bets, it would be far easier to inflate Polymarket odds in Harris' favor, because of an imbalance in liquidity between the candidates.  Currently, Polymarket has racked up $2.5 billion in trading volume on its U.S. election market. From a liquidity perspective, there are more than $50 million worth of resting sell orders in the order book for Trump and $20 million worth for Harris. This means wannabe buyers have that much inventory to trade with for each candidate.  As a result, the amount of capital required to move the needle for Harris by 1 percentage point is around $70,000, based on order book data. For Trump, it is more than 10 times as much: $718,000.  Yet even $718,000 wouldn't be a big number from the perspective of the French trader, who amassed tens of millions in bets on Trump, supporting Pidot's interpretation that he split orders across accounts to avoid slippage.  Cross-market arbitrage  A large contributor to market prices generally being efficient (aka reflecting reality) is connected to arbitrage trading across trading venues. Polymarket isn't the only prediction market offering election odds. The largest market in Europe is Betfair, which has £170 million ($220 million) in matched bets, while the likes of Robinhood and Kalshi have also added election markets.  The fragmentation of betting across multiple venues means that if prices get out of whack on one platform, that price should almost immediately get knocked back in line with other markets because there is near-instantaneous money to be made by selling the higher price on one platform and buying a lower price on another.  “I do expect smaller teams to be picking up easy arbitrages (when different platforms have different odds),” van Rossum added.  However, there are a few reasons why odds might be higher for bets on Trump winning (and other outcomes) on Polymarket. For one thing, the platform does not charge trading fees, so traders are willing to pay higher prices.  By contrast, Betfair, for example, deducts a ""vigorish"" of 5% to 10% from the winning bettor's payout, so traders there have to discount their bids.  ""Waiving fees makes trading more frictionless, which makes it easier for traders to arb between contracts (or between one market and another) to weed out mispricing,"" said Pidot, of American Civics Exchange.  Aaron Brogan, a managing attorney at Brogan Law, noted another possible reason for price discrepancies. Whereas regulated markets like Kalshi are for U.S. residents only, Polymarket's user base is made up of non-U.S. persons (plus naughty Americans using VPNs).  ""If these distinct groups have different media environments, they could be systematically exposed to different information about the election, and so form different opinions about the probability of certain outcomes,"" Brogan told CoinDesk.  ""It's easy to tell a story where Polymarket’s user base tends to get their news from Elon Musk’s X and the regulated markets’ users tend to get their news from Bloomberg and The New York Times,"" he said. ""One side sees a little more pro-Trump content, the other side sees a little more pro-Harris content, and they infer from that that one or the other is more likely to win.""  To be clear: potential cognitive bias of participants doesn't undermine the informational value of these markets, Brogan added.  ""People with different priors come to different conclusions, but there’s the idea that the net of these converges to truth,"" he said. ""If neither Polymarket nor the regulated markets are statistically representative samples of interested observers, then they might differ, but the weighted average of these markets together is probably closer to truth than any are individually.""  Parlor games  It's not even clear that inflating Trump's Polymarket odds would have the supposedly intended political effect.  Hypothetically, if Russia wanted to manipulate prediction markets to help Trump, ""do they push his price up or down? Because I can see that working both ways,"" said Olas Protocol's Murray.  ""If they push his price up, you galvanize Harris's base"" to show up at the polls, undermining the alleged goal, he said.  Pidot has advanced a more prosaic and amusing theory: The French trader is a luxury goods exporter trying to hedge the risk of tariffs in the event Trump wins.  (For whatever it's worth: Peter Thiel, whose Founders Fund invested in Polymarket's last funding round, was an early investor in Bullish, two years before that company acquired CoinDesk. Bullish has not disclosed a cap table since 2021, and CoinDesk journalists do not know the current roster of investors in its parent, which is not involved in editorial decisions.)  Turning the tables, Harry Crane, a statistics professor at Rutgers University in New Jersey, has a theory about why there have been so many news stories alleging manipulation.  “I believe the narrative about manipulation is an attempt by legacy media to discredit these markets, which threatens their ability to control the narrative,"" he said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,"Oliver Knight, Marc Hochstein",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/11/04/us-election-betting-polymarket-manipulation-claims-miss-the-mark,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bc6fb0334c5a06fe9ff45d5cea52775e2f77f31f-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The sector has experienced a nearly 10% surge in the last 24 hours, with Trump-themed memecoins leading the way. Following the recent performance, some investors forecast a massive rally for these tokens in the coming days. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Bull Market Over? Analyst Reveals Bear Case That Could Send Price To $28,000 Trump-Themed Memecoins See 30% Jump The PolitiFi sector gained popularity after several memecoins inspired by US politicians registered a massive performance earlier this year. Some tokens had their market capitalization break above the $100 million mark, with a couple still holding the feat. Memecoins inspired by the former US President and Republican candidate Donald J. Trump have led the sector throughout his presidential campaign. The tokens recorded massive rallies this year, hitting their peak during Q2. Cryptocurrencies like MAGA (TRUMP) and Doland Tremp (TREMP) hit the $17 and $1.5 marks, respectively, as their all-time high (ATH), fueled by Trump’s crypto-friendly statements. However, most of these cryptocurrencies have retraced significantly since June, pulling back over 70% in most cases. Now that the elections are just hours away, the PolitiFi sector is soaring again, surging around 10% in the last 24 hours, while the crypto market sees a 1.5% retrace. Memecoins themed after Trump held their lead, registering green performance during the past day. TRUMP has seen a 26% surge in the last 24 hours, trading above the $3.8 range. Meanwhile, MAGA Hat (MAGA) records a 32.6% price jump in the same timeframe, nearing a $90 million market cap earlier today. MAGA’s daily trading activity has also increased nearly 30%, registering a $41.7 million trading volume on the last day. PolitiFi Tokens In The Hands Of The Election The sector’s rally is seemingly fueled by the anticipation surrounding the elections. Notably, volatility is forecasted to peak in the following days as speculation about the election’s outcome increases. Some investors believe the PolitiFi token’s rally will continue in the following days, with Trump-themed memecoins expected to skyrocket in case of Trump’s victory. Just 10 hours before the election, the Republican candidate’s winning odds are considerably higher than the Democratic nominee, Kamala Harris. Polymarket’s live forecast shows that Trump leads the prediction market with a 15% gap. Following the presidential debate, the former president lost ground to the US Vice President in early September. At the time, the Democratic nominee surpassed Trump’s winning odds by 4%. However, these have seen a significant retrace in the last month. Related Reading: ADA Slips Below $0.3389 Level, Deeper Downtrend Looming? The Republican candidate regained his lead in October, recording a considerable 33% gap between his winning odds and Harris’.

Amid Trump’s winning odds, the memecoins inspired by the US VP have recorded a considerable decrease in the past day.

42373430,0XGGWk56kaPxudnYllDW1f,1730744898,First UK Pension Fund Invests in Bitcoin,"British pension specialist Cartwright has guided the country's first pension fund to allocate money into bitcoin.  The unnamed fund invested 3% of its total assets directly into the token, as opposed to using a proxy such as a spot ETF.  Cartwright is also launching a Bitcoin Employee Benefits scheme, which would allow employers to pay bitcoin directly into staff wallets.  British pension specialist Cartwright is urging institutional investors to allocate assets into bitcoin {{BTC}} and has successfully guided the country’s first pension fund to make an allocation into the token, industry magazine Corporate Advisor reported.  The unnamed fund last month allocated 3% of its £50 million ($65 million) into bitcoin following “lengthy consultations with the scheme’s trustees, where ESG, investment case and security were all addressed at length,” Glenn Cameron, head of digital assets at Cartwright told Corporate Advisor.  This investment is particularly notable as the pension fund actually is investing in the crypto itself, rather than, for instance, a proxy such as an ETF. The private key is split between five independent institutions, according to the report.  What's also notable is the relative size of the investment. The State of Wisconsin pension, for instance, made news months ago by being the first U.S. state pension plan to invest in bitcoin (via the spot ETFs). That investment, though, footed to just about 0.1% of the plan's assets. This U.K. pension investment is for a far more sizable 3% of its assets.

Experts believe such a reduction could occur even in the coming weeks or months, despite the pattern being harder to predict. In addition to these worries, there isn’t enough good buying volume. Peak purchasing activity typically comes before price growth in a healthy market. Regretfully, TRX hasn’t been like this recently. It is evident from the present trading activity that buyers are not entering the market with sufficient zeal, which could be short-term bad news for TRON investors. TRON Holding Period Down TRX investors have been holding TRON coins for a shorter period of time as the holding period fell by a whopping 70% as of lately. The downtime can be seen as a thanks to the lack of faith investors have in the coin’s value in the future. The number of people who have a habit of keeping their TRON coins for a longer duration has also fallen. This has happened due to the fact that more investors have started selling their coins. The CMF indicator, which is the measure of the pulled push activity, also makes this view stronger. Will TRX Make It Big In 6 Months? TRX is currently down 2.02% over the past day. This could be due to traders being cautious. In light of this double top and the rise in selling volume, traders should exercise caution in order to anticipate and seize the trend reversal and subsequent decline. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks $73,000, Yet Google Searches Stay Stagnant—Is Hype Fading?

Traders should continue to watch for external shocks from market volatility and economic factors that could affect their investment as TRX approaches these respective milestones.

42373440,0XGGWk56kaPxudnYllDWsF,1730739306,Bitcoin Hits Record High Against BlackRock's U.S. Treasury ETF as Investors Search for Returns: Van Straten,"BlackRock's long-term U.S. treasury bond ETF, TLT, has dropped 8% year-to-date against bitcoin, which is up 55%.  U.S. Treasuries are considered a liquid, global reserve asset.  Bitcoin dominance made new highs over the weekend at 60.56% of crypto-market cap.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} is becoming even more dominant in crypto markets and is growing in importance against U.S. Treasuries, the bedrock of the American financial system and among the world's largest and most liquid markets, in a signal some investors may be looking to take on more risk in the search for greater returns.  Last week, as the world's largest cryptocurrency approached March's all-time high above $73,000, it was trading at a record 800 times the value of BlackRock's iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT). That's up from 466 at the time of BTC's previous peak, in November 2021.  Treasuries, backed by the credit of the government of the world's largest economy, are considered among the safest assets to own. They are held by many central banks worldwide as reserve assets because they're seen as a reliable store of value. They also serve as a benchmark for interest rates worldwide, and when yields increase, the price falls and vice versa.  That may be an issue for some investors. Since interest rates started rising during the Covid-19 pandemic, we appear to have entered an era of economic uncertainty. Rates are unlikely to drop back to 0% for several reasons: stubborn services inflation, the U.S.'s nearly $2 trillion budget deficit — almost 100% debt to GDP — and conflicts in eastern Europe and the Middle East.  The absence of an incentive for price gains may be why the ETF which has $60 billion in total assets, has lost 7% this year, while bitcoin has rallied 55%. The relative performance might indicate that investors could be moving parts of their portfolio to bitcoin from long-term Treasuries.  Due to the fundamental properties of bitcoin and with the huge success of the U.S.-listed spot ETFs this year, bitcoin may be starting to emerge as a relatively safe asset for some global investors as economic uncertainty continues.  Bitcoin's rally has driven its share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization to a new cycle high of 60.56%. For crypto investors, this may, conversely, indicate a risk-off move, as they shed holdings of riskier alternative currencies (altcoins) in favor of the market leader ahead of the U.S. election.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,James Van Straten,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/11/04/bitcoin-hits-record-high-against-blackrocks-us-treasury-etf-as-investors-search-for-returns-van-straten,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5d53a64ff4d9436401fdb8062454fb60df78dce4-6000x3376.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

35670393,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=651569,1730738478,Bitcoin Price Forecast: What To Expect In The Final 24 Hours Before US Election,"As the US presidential election approaches, the Bitcoin price has found a stable support range between $68,000 and $69,000, just shy of its all-time high earlier this year. While the cryptocurrency has struggled to surpass this significant milestone, investor sentiment remains cautiously optimistic, with expectations for further price increases tempered by anticipated market volatility in the upcoming hours. Bitcoin Price Expected To Swing 8% Post-Election The options market indicates the Bitcoin price could see price swings of approximately 8% in either direction following the election, a notable increase compared to the typical 2% fluctuations seen on regular trading days. Caroline Mauron, co-founder of Orbit Markets, a crypto derivatives liquidity provider, noted that “no significant volatility premium is priced in after Nov. 7,” suggesting the market anticipates a relatively swift resolution to the election results. Related Reading: Solana Expected To Reach $500 By Bull Run’s End, Says Crypto Analyst The election pits Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump against Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, with both candidates eliciting varied responses from the crypto community. Trump’s favorable stance towards cryptocurrencies has positioned Bitcoin as part of the so-called “Trump trades,” especially in light of the regulatory crackdown experienced under President Joe Biden. As Trump’s odds have fluctuated in betting markets, the Bitcoin price has mirrored these changes, briefly nearing record highs before retreating as polls indicate a tightly contested race. The options market reflects a balanced sentiment, with an even distribution of bearish and bullish positions throughout October, indicating that traders are preparing for upward and downward movements as the election draws near. Data from the Deribit exchange suggests a potential trading range of $60,000 to $80,000 for the Bitcoin price in the weeks following the election, based on peak open interest in options contracts. Path To $100,000 Remains Viable Crypto analyst Miles Deutscher has also shared his view on social media, positing that a Trump victory could lead to an immediate Bitcoin price surge, potentially establishing a new all-time high this year. Conversely, the analyst suggests that a win for Harris might result in a price drop, delaying any new highs until Q1 2025. Regardless of the election outcome, Deutscher remains confident that Bitcoin will reach $100,000. Market expert Patric H. adds another layer of analysis, observing that Bitcoin closed the past week above a daily downtrend channel, indicating a potential reversal. However, Patrick notes that the weekly candle shows weakness, prompting market participants to de-risk before the election. His bullish thesis hinges on Bitcoin holding above $65,000; a drop below this level could signal a return to extended price volatility. Related Reading: Dogecoin (DOGE) Poised for a Move: Will It Start a Fresh Increase? From a trading perspective, data indicates that perpetual traders on Binance have withdrawn limit buy orders below $50,000, suggesting a shift in sentiment. Previously, there was substantial long interest in the “multi-billion dollar range” between $42,000 and $50,000, but traders appear to have sidelined that capital in favor of higher price levels. The next significant limit buy order is $63,800, with additional smaller orders scattered down to that level, indicating that Bitcoin may not fall significantly below this point. On the upside, the next significant resistance level for the Bitcoin price is $73,000, where substantial selling interest from Coinbase and Binance is noted. Patrick anticipates a potential rejection in the $75,000 to $76,000 range, which could precede a breakout if those levels are successfully breached. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $68,360, up 0.8% over the past 24 hours.

35669837,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=651497,1730737846,"Ethereum Risk-To-Reward Ratio Is ‘Too Good To Pass Up’ – Top Analyst Sets $6,000 Target","Ethereum is trading at a critical demand level following an 11% pullback from recent local highs. This dip has analysts and investors on edge, as losing this level could trigger a wave of aggressive sell-offs, potentially driving ETH prices lower. Amid this concern, however, prominent analyst Ali Martinez has shared an optimistic technical analysis, highlighting a strong risk-to-reward setup on the Ethereum chart. According to Martinez, the current level offers a compelling entry point, suggesting that Ethereum could see a significant upside if it holds support. Related Reading: Solana Likely To Target $200 ‘If It Holds Current Support’ – What To Expect The timing of this potential rebound is especially noteworthy with the US election tomorrow, an event that could heavily influence broader market sentiment. Many in the crypto community anticipate that election outcomes will set the stage for a new rally, with Ethereum positioned to capitalize if bullish momentum returns. In the coming days, all eyes will be on whether ETH can defend this demand zone, as its performance could either validate or challenge the prevailing bullish expectations across the market. For now, Ethereum’s price level remains pivotal, and the market is closely watching for signs of direction amid the election and broader economic uncertainties. Can Ethereum Hold Above Key Demand? Ethereum is trading at a pivotal support level of around $2,450, which many analysts view as a critical “last line of defense” for bulls. Ethereum could experience a deeper decline if this level fails, potentially putting it at risk of underperforming against competitors like Solana or Bitcoin, which have recently shown more relative strength. Investors share this concern and are closely watching ETH’s movement as it teeters on the edge of this crucial support. However, top crypto analyst Ali Martinez has presented a more optimistic perspective on X, suggesting that Ethereum may be poised for a significant recovery. In his recent technical analysis, Martinez emphasized that the current risk-to-reward ratio for ETH is highly attractive for a long position, especially for those with a longer-term outlook. He disclosed that he had set a stop-loss below $1,880—a level limiting downside risk—while targeting an ambitious price of $6,000. This target represents a potential 145% rally from current prices, underlining Martinez’s confidence in Ethereum’s potential upside if it can hold this crucial zone. The next few days, or even hours, could prove decisive for Ethereum as it consolidates at $2,450. To move toward Martinez’s target, ETH must build strength and start challenging local highs, signaling buyers are stepping in. Related Reading: Dogecoin Analyst Reveals Buying Opportunities At Lower Prices – Details The upcoming price action will reveal whether Ethereum can revive its bullish momentum or succumb to further downside pressure. For now, the $2,450 support is a critical threshold for ETH’s near-term trajectory. ETH Technical Analysis Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2,450 after a strong rebound following a failed breakdown below the $2,400 mark. This resilience is encouraging for bulls who believe ETH is primed for a significant rally, especially if Bitcoin can break above its all-time high. However, this crucial support level alone isn’t enough to spark a sustained uptrend. Bulls must push the price above the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA), currently at $2,762, to confirm momentum and establish a stronger bullish outlook. The 200-day EMA has acted as a formidable resistance since early August, repeatedly pushing ETH’s price down. A breakout above this moving average would indicate a critical shift, potentially turning it into a new support level. This move would set the stage for ETH to challenge higher levels, fueled by renewed buyer confidence and broader market optimism. Related Reading: Bitcoin On-Chain Indicator Signals Panic Selling At Current Levels – Time To HODL? Conversely, if bulls fail to reclaim this EMA, Ethereum may face continued downward pressure, leading to further testing of key supports. For now, ETH’s support of around $2,450 keeps hope alive for bulls aiming for a breakout, but reclaiming the 200-day EMA remains essential to fuel the next leg of a bullish rally.

42373433,0XGGWk56kaPxudnYllDWHR,1730735457,The Toll of Mental Biases in Crypto Investing,"Investing in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin often evokes strong emotional responses and mental biases. The volatility and rapid price swings can lead to impulsive decisions driven by fear and greed, rather than rational analysis. These biases can significantly impact investment outcomes, often leading to suboptimal returns and heightened risk. This is where a systematic momentum strategy, such as the AMINA CoinDesk BTC Momentum Strategy, may play a crucial role in mitigating these biases and enhancing investment performance.  Mental Biases in Crypto Investing  Mental biases are psychological factors that influence decision-making. Common biases that have been extensively documented in academics include:  Overconfidence Bias: Investors often overestimate their knowledge and ability to predict market movements, leading to excessive trading and increased risk exposure.  Herd Mentality: The tendency to follow the crowd can lead to buying during market peaks and selling during troughs, often resulting in significant losses.  Loss Aversion: The fear of losses can cause investors to hold onto losing positions for too long, hoping for a rebound, while being quick to sell winning positions to lock in gains.  Anchoring: Relying too heavily on initial information or the purchase price can prevent investors from adjusting their positions based on new market realities.  These biases can lead to erratic investment behaviour, increased volatility, and extreme drawdowns per Almeida & Goncalves (2023). For instance, during market downturns, the impulse to sell assets can lock in losses, while the fear of missing out (FOMO) during rallies can lead to buying at inflated prices. These effects tend to be more extreme in more speculative asset classes and cryptocurrencies are certainly one of the most speculative asset classes.  Benefits of a Systematic Momentum Strategy  A systematic momentum strategy, like the AMINA CoinDesk BTC Momentum Strategy, addresses these mental biases by relying on quantitative signals rather than emotional decision-making.  This approach offers several key benefits:  1. Reduced Volatility and Drawdowns: By dynamically allocating between Bitcoin and cash based on momentum indicators, the strategy aims to minimize exposure during periods of high volatility and downturns. This may result in lower drawdowns compared to a pure buy-and-hold strategy.  According to the AMINA CoinDesk BTC Momentum Strategy performance data, which includes backfilled historical data, the strategy achieved an annualized return of 36.2% with an annualized volatility of 42.8%, compared to Bitcoin's 26.0% return with 66.6% volatility. The maximum drawdown for the momentum strategy was -53.5%, significantly lower than Bitcoin's -79.8%.  2. Improved Risk-Adjusted Returns: The strategy generated higher risk-adjusted returns, as indicated by its Sharpe Ratio of 0.85, compared to Bitcoin's 0.39 over the same period. This suggests that the momentum strategy provides better returns for the level of risk taken.  3. Systematic Decision-Making: By using transparent and predefined rules for trading, the strategy mitigates the influence of emotions and biases. This systematic approach helps ensure that investment decisions are based on objective data rather than subjective judgment.  4. Diversification and Flexibility: The strategy's ability to switch between bitcoin and cash provides a level of diversification and flexibility that can protect against extreme market conditions. This adaptability is crucial in managing the unique risks associated with the highly volatile crypto market.  Figure 1: Performance Comparison between AMINA CoinDesk BTC Momentum Strategy (BTIAMINA) and the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX).  In conclusion, mental biases are a significant challenge in crypto investing, often leading to poor decision-making and increased risk in the form of volatility and drawdowns. A systematic momentum strategy, such as the AMINA CoinDesk BTC Momentum Strategy, offers a robust solution by aiming to reduce volatility, improve risk-adjusted returns, and mitigate the effects of emotional decision-making. By adhering to a disciplined investment approach, investors can better achieve more stable and favorable outcomes in the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies.  For more information visit our website.

42373431,0XGGWk56kaPxudnYllDW6v,1730735150,The ‘Trump Trade’ Crypto Narrative is Overblown,"Bitcoin has been soaring recently, as have Trump’s odds of winning this week’s U.S. presidential election, at least according to prediction markets like PredictIt and Polymarket.  Bitcoin recently crossed $73,000 and nearly touched its prior all-time high on the same day that Trump’ odds of winning the election on betting market Polymarket hit 69%, its highest level since the failed assassination attempt on the former president’s life in June.  Many pundits see Bitcoin’s recent strength as a sign that investors are positioning for a potential Trump victory. Others have gone further, arguing that recent strength in U.S. stocks and even the dollar are being driven by Trump wagers, as investors anticipate tax cuts will boost corporate profits, and protectionist trade policies could strengthen the greenback. Collectively, this is known as the “Trump Trade,” and if you read the papers, and more than a few sell-side reports, it’s all the rage!  It's a tidy (if unnerving) narrative, but is it even true?  To find out, we looked at the data.  Prediction markets were a good place to start. Polymarket and PredictIt allow bettors to wager on who will win the election. Until recently, the two candidates were in a dead heat, but, more recently, Trump’s odds have started to tick higher. So, we took the odds from the last two months from both prediction markets, averaged the two, and then performed a correlation analysis with other asset classes, securities and indices.  A score of 1 denotes a 100% correlation, and 0 means no correlation. A score of -1 means that two things are 100% inversely correlated.  Here’s what we found:  Unsurprisingly, Trump Media and Technology Group (DJT), owner of Truth Social, is more likely to do better when Trump’s odds of winning go up. Same with oil. And stocks have a positive 10% correlation with Trump’s odds. Bitcoin shows almost no correlation with either. So, the Trump Trade shows up in the data, but it’s pretty modest and probably massively overblown.  To be sure, prediction markets are but one data point. And there’s recent reporting from Fortunethat one-third of the activity on Polymarket is wash trading, designed to make them appear more popular than they really are, or as some critics argue, to “prop up” Trump’s odds. Not everyone is pricing in prediction market data, and given their newness, many may be discounting it. Still, as Bloomberg has reported recently, Wall Street is paying close attention and so must we.  The weak correlations and overblown narratives should give some comfort that we can stop fretting over the election as some huge catalyst for markets.  My personal view is that the election is short term negative and long term very positive, regardless of the outcome. In the short run, a Trump win could be a “buy the rumor…sell the news” event, given prices are near all time high, while a Harris win could lead to a knee jerk reaction as some traders just assume she’ll be worse for the asset class. In the long run, and regardless of who is president, Web3 adoption is accelerating as finance and other industries become digitized, while deficit spending will continue to create demand for other stores of value like bitcoin.  Who would be better for crypto – Harris or Trump?  I generally think people are overstating the impact of who’s in charge. That isn’t to say that governments do not impact new industries and markets.  In fact, there’s a lot a new administration could do, such as:  Encourage Congress to pass industry-friendly legislation, such as a stablecoin bill  Clear the way for more corporate issuers to debut on U.S. exchanges  Reset relations between the SEC and the Web3 industry  Reform financial services regulation to create more room for innovation  Open energy markets to encourage Bitcoin miners to bring operations onshore.  I believe that much of this is sensible and even long overdue.  But I remain skeptical that Donald Trump will be the standard bearer of real, positive progress in this area. He has historically lacked the patience or even a sustained interest to see many priorities through and he is notorious for changing his mind when it’s no longer helpful politically.  His economic plan may also backfire on many businesses and industries including crypto. Business leaders may welcome a tax cut to 15% from 21%, but as right-leaning think-tank The Cato Institute has argued, his economic plan would exacerbate the deficit and send inflation soaring again.  Some have made the case that this kind of chaos is the point. Mark Cuban, the outspoken billionaire investor who supports Harris, believes VCs and tech people support Trump precisely because they believe his tax cuts, deficit spending plans and tariffs will cause inflation, sending bitcoin soaring.  This feels a bit cynical. Presidents simply don’t have that much influence. Plus, business can’t succeed in a world that is failing (though perhaps Bitcoin can).  Those who have worked closely with him have told often how Trump is easily swayed on issues.  Recent reporting suggests Trump’s main interest is in using crypto to make money, evidenced by the launch of his own DeFi project, World Liberty Financial (WLF). Even pro-Trumpers are nervous about WLF because they worry, with some justification, that it will undermine faith in the industry and make Trump’s recent pivot seem insincere.  Trump’s crypto position is a modern spin on the old adage ""What's good for General Motors is good for America."" Replace “General Motors” with “Trump, Inc.” and you're not far off from his view of the role of government.  Will his interest in crypto wane when it no longer suits him? This is a question many pro-crypto voters should consider carefully before heading to the polls.

October 2024 marked a significant milestone for spot Bitcoin ETFs, which saw their highest net weekly inflows since March. As the U.S. presidential elections approached , market momentum intensified, resulting in notable net gains in Bitcoin ETF holdings.In under a year since their launch, Bitcoin ETFs have collectively amassed over 1 million BTC, valued at approximately $70 billion.Climbing Holdings and October GainsThe accumulation trend for Bitcoin ETFs showed consistent growth leading into October. As of September 16, total holdings stood at approximately 909.36K BTC, increasing to 931.64K BTC by September 30. October sustained this upward momentum, with mid-month figures hitting 943.77K BTC and reaching 957.32K BTC by October 14.

The net inflows brought $2.11 billion into the market, as highlighted by CryptoQuant's CEO, Ki Young Ju. This influx highlighted BlackRock’s pivotal role in fueling the growth of Bitcoin ETF holdings and its potential impact on the broader market. The increased flow indicated strengthened investor confidence and interest during a crucial pre-election period.Price Trends and Sustained ETF InterestIn a follow-up commentary, Young Ju highlighted how demand for Bitcoin spot ETFs has consistently grown when the asset's price remains above key thresholds. For instance, the accompanying chart shows that the average net flow for ETFs of BlackRock, Fidelity, and Ark Invest was notably higher when Bitcoin's price was between $65K and $70K. Young Ju emphasized that spot ETF inflows have remained mostly positive when Bitcoin trades above $61K.

42373422,0XGGWk56kaPxudnYllDVbN,1730734166,"If U.S. Election Is Disputed, Prediction Markets Could Face 'Hornet's Nest'","At first blush, it looks redundant.  The weekend before the U.S. presidential election, crypto-based prediction market Polymarket spun up a contract betting on who will be inaugurated as the next leader of the free world.  As anyone who has paid the slightest bit of attention to crypto or election news coverage this year knows, Polymarket already had a heavily traded contract on which candidate will win the presidential race.  That contract has seen more than $3 billion in trading volume, according to Polymarket, with more than $200 million worth of open interest, or positions outstanding, according to a Dune Analytics dashboard prepared by the user mahdi0077.  There's a subtle difference between the ""winner"" contract, which Polymarket has listed since February, and the new ""inauguration"" one. That difference highlights a challenge facing prediction markets ahead of Tuesday's vote in a politically polarized, low-trust environment.  Namely: What if the election results aren't clear shortly after the polls close? Or, if they are clear to one side, what if the purportedly losing candidate disputes them, as Donald Trump did four years ago, leading to the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol riot? Or if one candidate concedes but then withdraws the concession, as Democrat Albert Gore did in 2000, leading to a Supreme Court case?  There ""could be a hornet's nest about this next week,"" Koleman Strumpf, an economics professor at Wake Forest University in North Carolina, told CoinDesk by email last week.  'Winner' vs. 'inaugurated'  In prediction markets, traders bet on verifiable outcomes of real-world events in specified time frames. Typically, they buy ""yes"" or ""no"" shares in an outcome, and each share pays $1 if the prediction comes true, or zero if not. (On Polymarket, bets are settled in USDC, a stablecoin, or cryptocurrency that trades one-to-one for dollars; other platforms, including Kalshi and PredictIt, pay out regular greenbacks.)  As of Monday morning in New York, ""yes"" shares for Trump winning the presidency traded at 59 cents, indicating the market saw a 59% chance of victory for the Republican candidate. Democrat Kamala Harris' odds were at 41%.  The rules for Polymarket's ""winner"" contract say it will resolve once all three of the Associated Press, Fox News and NBC call the race. However, if all three media outlets haven't done so for the same candidate by Inauguration Day (Jan. 20, 2025), the market will be resolved according to who is inaugurated.  By contrast, Polymarket's new ""inauguration"" contract doesn't bother with press sources, and will wait until Jan. 20 to resolve. If no one has been inaugurated by then, it kicks the can to Jan. 31. And if no one has been inaugurated by then, both the Trump and Harris ""yes"" shares will resolve to ""no,"" and ""no"" holders for both candidates will collect payouts, which would be an unusual situation.  This is more in line with Kalshi's presidential contract, which resolves according to who is inaugurated on Jan. 20 (though the fine print says an inauguration doesn't count if ""the first person inaugurated as the President serves only in an acting (i.e., temporary) capacity"").  ""There may be disputes among the candidates and media about who wins the election, but only one will be inaugurated as determined by the official Executive Office of the President,"" said Jack Such, Kalshi's head of market research. ""For this reason, we believe resolving on inauguration day is the safest choice for our customers because it provides the highest clarity of resolution criteria.""  A Polymarket representative wouldn't comment for the record.  'A big headache'  There are tradeoffs between the two approaches.  ""The Polymarket resolution has the benefit of potentially resolving sooner, at [a] time when agreement on the resolution is generally accepted — and this might make it more popular because of the time value of money,"" said Aaron Brogan, a lawyer who has studied prediction markets.  (Offsetting the potential opportunity cost of a delayed payout, Kalshi is paying clients 4% interest on open positions, Such noted.)  On the other hand, a media outlet could make a call and then reverse it, as the Chicago Daily Tribune did in 1948 following the infamous ""Dewey Defeats Truman"" headline.  ""If the Polymarket contract resolves, and then one of the sources flips, it could be a big headache and a lot of litigation for everyone involved,"" Brogan said.  Potentially complicating matters, Polymarket uses UMA, a decentralized oracle service, to resolve markets and referee disputed outcomes. When a dispute arises, UMA token holders debate the matter a day or two, then vote on which side is correct.  An article in The Atlantic last week noted that UMA made a contentious decision earlier this year, resolving Polymarket's Venezuelan election contract for the opposition leader (who got more votes), despite incumbent Nicolas Maduro reportedly stealing the election. Polymarket has overruled UMA at least once (though not in the Venezuela case).  UMA co-founder Hart Lambur did not respond to a direct message sent on X (formerly Twitter).  'Both bad'  Flip Pidot, a prediction market veteran who wrote about 5,000 contracts for PredictIt, said the resolution criteria for Kalshi's and Polymarket's main presidential contract ""are both bad.""  Kalshi's criteria, tied to the inauguration, ""aren't necessarily ambiguous (which is the worst possible scenario), but they're potentially out of sync with the spirit of the market, which is who'll win the election,"" said Pidot, who is now CEO of American Civics Exchange, an over-the-counter dealer of political contracts.  For example, ""Trump could win, [then] die or be incarcerated or for some reason decline to be inaugurated, and J.D. Vance would 'win' the market (which means all traded outcomes would resolve No),"" he said. ""Or litigation or outright chaos could reign until past 1/20.""  As for Polymarket's criteria tied to the three media sources, ""any of those three outlets could say it's 'indeterminate' or 'too close to call' indefinitely, in which case you're left with the same inauguration test as Kalshi, which again, doesn't really match the test that's being traded (who wins the election),"" Pidot said.

This release supports the Chang 2 hard fork, an upgrade to complete Cardano's on-chain governance as outlined in CIP-1694. The upgrade moves Cardano beyond its initial ""bootstrap"" governance phase, which began with the Chang 1 hard fork on September 1.Cardano Next Upgrade: Chang Upgrade 2 Notably, the Chang upgrade is important for Cardano as it implements the final features of its on-chain governance system based on principles from the Voltaire era. The upgrade process was split into two parts to streamline adoption and ensure a smooth transition. With Chang 2, Cardano’s governance evolves as it allows ADA holders to participate in protocol decision-making directly.Following this upgrade, ADA holders will have the option to delegate their voting power to Delegated Representatives (DReps) or assume a DRep role themselves. New Capabilities and Technical Enhancements in Node 10.1.1Cardano Node 10.1.1 incorporates several key improvements beyond governance. This release introduces new Plutus primitives, enhancing smart contract functionality, as detailed in CIP-0122, CIP-0123, and CIP-0127. Stake Pool Operators (SPOs) will find improved support for SPO delegation to predefined voting options, along with enhancements across the ledger, API, CLI, and networking.However, this release includes breaking changes. As older features phase out, SPOs and developers are to review the release notes on Intersect GitHub to ensure compatibility.Technical Readiness and Community InvolvementThe enactment of Chang 2 requires a vote from the Interim Constitutional Committee (ICC) and 51% of the stake from SPOs. Upon meeting these thresholds, a one-epoch ratification period will follow, after which the hard fork will be take full effect. SPOs, DApps, and exchanges must prepare for this upgrade, as compatibility with Node 10.1.1 will be essential to support seamless post-upgrade operations.Intersect, the organization facilitating Cardano’s governance infrastructure, will provide an ecosystem readiness page for tracking progress through the upgrade phases. The hard fork working group will also host Q&A sessions to answer community questions and provide guidance on the technical changes.After Chang 2: Era of Community-Driven GovernanceOnce Chang 2 is in place, Cardano’s governance will operate through decentralized voting, allowing ADA holders to shape the future of the blockchain through GovTool and other governance initiatives. The community will have opportunities to join working groups and participate in open sessions to craft and refine governance proposals, including budgeting and protocol improvements.",POSITIVE,ADA,ADA | BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | TRADING | FORKS,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/04/cardano-latest-node-release-brings-full-on-chain-governance-with-chang-2-hard-fork/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=cardano-latest-node-release-brings-full-on-chain-governance-with-chang-2-hard-fork,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (also called a16z) donated another $23 million to pro-crypto super political action committee (PAC) Fairshake for the 2026 midterm election cycle, according to a blog post from Chris Dixon, a partner at a16z and the founder and leader of its crypto division.  “Regardless of what happens in the 2024 elections, we’re committed to supporting policymakers, irrespective of party affiliation, who will work to establish a practical regulatory framework that protects consumers while allowing the industry to grow,” Dixon wrote.  With a16z’s fresh contribution, Fairshake and its affiliated PACs – the Democrat-oriented Protect Progress and the Republican-oriented Defend American Jobs – now have $78 million in their coffers for the 2026 midterm elections. Crypto exchange Coinbase committed $25 million to Fairshake last week, and, according to a Fairshake spokesperson, the group has “$30 million in the bank.”  Both Coinbase and a16z are repeat donors to Fairshake, which raised over $200 million in the 2023-2024 election cycle. Coinbase was the single biggest donor: its fresh commitment to Fairshake brings its total contribution to the PAC closet to $75 million. A16z’s new contribution brings the firm to about $60 million in commitments to Fairshake.  Crypto firm Ripple has also been a big donor to Fairshake, contributing $50 million to the PAC for the 2023-2024 election cycle. When asked if the company planned to make another donation to Fairshake for the 2026 elections, a representative for Ripple said the company ""intend[s] to remain a strong force in DC for years to come,"" but did not currently have fundraising news to share.  Other crypto companies who have donated to Fairshake and its affiliates include Jump Crypto, Circle and Kraken.

Interestingly, recent data shows Shibarium has seen an impressive uptick in activity, with daily transactions reaching 4.68 million in the past 24 hours. At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at $0.00001677 and is back into the negative movement in both the seven-day and 30-day timeframes. However, the uptick in activity has given SHIB investors something to watch closely to see if this momentum could drive the token’s price closer to $0.00008. Shibarium Sees Surge In Transaction Activity According to data from Shibariumscan, 4.68 million transactions were processed on the layer-2 network in the past 24 hours, which essentially kickstarts November on a good month. Speaking of November, it’s only been three days into the month, and Shibarium has already processed more than 13.4 million transactions. Related Reading: Bitcoin Completes Retest Phase: Only One Thing Left For A $110,000 Price By December A closer look at the transaction data reveals a progressive rise in network activity each day. Particularly, data from Shibarium scan shows that 4.21 million transactions were processed on November 1, 4.53 million transactions were processed on November 2, and 4.68 transactions were processed on November 3. Interestingly, this represents an increase of about 103,800% from the 6,540 transactions registered on Sunday, October 27. With this spike in activity, the Shiba Inu community is seeing increased interest in SHIB and related tokens like BONE, which also benefits from Shibarium. The uptick in transaction activity has, in turn, increased the number of BONE tokens recouped as transaction fees, which is also positive in terms of SHIB burns. This is because the accumulated BONE fees on Shibarium are exchanged for SHIB tokens. These SHIB tokens are subsequently burned and permanently removed from circulation, leading to a reduction in the total supply of SHIB. SHIB’s Price To Push Toward $0.00008? Shibarium has undoubtedly been one of the strong pillars of the Shiba Inu ecosystem since its launch. Therefore, the uptick in Shibarium activity is one of the first steps for the SHIB price to return to its all-time high levels of around $0.00008. Related Reading: Bitcoin Flashes Buy Signal After Price Closed 2nd Green Month Candle In A Row At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at $0.00001677 and has lost its footing above $0.000017 in the past 24 hours. While achieving $0.00008 would be a steep climb, sustained growth in Shibarium’s usage could provide a strong foundation for future price gains. Right now, the first step towards a return to $0.00008 would be SHIB bulls creating a price floor around $0.000017 or $0.0000165 that would reject any further declines. Nonetheless, November and the upcoming US elections promise to be a bullish month for SHIB and the wider crypto industry.

35666853,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=100388,1730731914,Dutch Telco Giant Launches Bitcoin Mining Pilot Using Renewable Energy,"T-Systems Multimedia Solutions (MMS), a subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom (T-Mobile’s parent company), launches a Bitcoin mining pilot using renewable energy. The company announced the development today, noting that it has partnered with private bank Bankhaus Metzler for the initiative. According to the announcement, the pilot aims to gather relevant data on stabilizing Germany’s energy grid during high fluctuations. Deutsche Telekom Taps Bitcoin Mining to Stabilize Germany Power Grid The initiative was introduced to regulate power in Germany due to the variable outputs from renewable energy. Specifically, the announcement acknowledged that solar and wind-powered renewable energy sources usually produce excess power on different occasions. Hence, the Bitcoin mining pilot will leverage wind and solar energy sources to stabilize Germany’s power grid. This process is similar to a method used in some countries, such as the United States and Finland. Specifically, Deutsche Telekom will harness the flexible load of Bitcoin mining to stabilize Germany’s power grid.Benefits and Other Features of the Pilot Besides stabilizing the power grid, Deutsche Telekom believes the project will be beneficial to wind and solar power-generating companies. It emphasized that these companies are facing the challenge of unpredictable control performance.Furthermore, Metis Solution will host and manage the Bitcoin mining project while the ‘containers’ are located in a solar-powered site at Riva GmbH Engineering. While MMS will handle the blockchain infrastructure aspect of the Bitcoin mining pilot, Bankhaus Metzler will focus on the financial service segment.Commenting on the development, Oliver Nyderle, MMS’ Head of Digital Trust and Web3 Infrastructure, recognized the need to control the rising fluctuations emanating from renewable energy sources.Hence, Nyderie noted that the company will test the control effect of Bitcoin mining on the power grid, thus converting excess energy into digital value. The development comes several months after Deutsche Telekom first revealed plans to venture into Bitcoin mining. Dirk Röder, Telekom’s Head of web3 infrastructure and solutions, first revealed the development at a Bitcoin conference in Prague in June. The company has now flagged off a Bitcoin mining pilot to stabilize the energy grid during high fluctuations.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | MINING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/04/dutch-telco-giant-launches-bitcoin-mining-pilot-using-renewable-energy/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=dutch-telco-giant-launches-bitcoin-mining-pilot-using-renewable-energy,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

We believe this rally was initially caused by the “ Trump Trade ” narrative, which then gave way to continued uncertainty over the outcome of tomorrow’s US presidential election. This lack of confidence is also being reflected in the Bitcoin options market . On the eve of election day, markets see a Republican victory as favourable for BTC, while a Democrat win leaves the outlook more ambiguous. Average betting odds for a Trump win have fallen from 64.9 percent to 56 percent. In the options markets, front-end implied volatility for contracts with the earliest expiry is unusually subdued up to election day (November 5th). This muted volatility suggests investors are holding back, waiting for the dust to settle. A spike in volatility is still expected , however, around November 5th to 8th, which could either fuel big moves or, if it fails to materialise, signal a deeper market caution. There is also apathy in the altcoin markets, with Bitcoin dominance reaching over 60 percent—a new cycle high . Altcoins are now seeing severe drawdowns whenever BTC pullbacks. Ethereum and Solana have both dropped around 12 percent from their recent highs, and ETH is now 40 percent down from its initial ETF rally. The speculative interest that once supported altcoins seems to have vanished , reflected in stable funding rates and muted overall market sentiment. With BTC absorbing most of the capital flow into crypto assets, altcoins are struggling to keep up, and without a fresh catalyst, their prospects for a comeback in the near term appear slim. Even with last week’s pullback, Bitcoin’s overall resilience since its September low is noteworthy. In a nutshell, the current market dynamics point to an electrifying week ahead. Whether you’re a trader, investor, or casual observer, the road to election day promises to be anything but dull for the crypto market. The elections also come as the US economy continues to demonstrate resilience despite recent disruptions caused by two hurricanes and ongoing industrial strikes. While there have been modest job losses and downward revisions to jobs market data, underlying labour market strength appears steady with a stable unemployment rate of 4.1 percent and wage growth at 4 percent year-on-year. Consumer spending and personal income also continues to rise , with real spending up and inflation pressures mainly contained within the service sector, suggesting stable demand as the holiday season approaches. Job openings have declined, reflecting reduced labour demand, but consumer confidence has surged, indicating optimism about job stability. GDP growth in the third quarter was strong at 2.8 percent, driven by robust consumer spending, though high interest rates have constrained residential investment. As inflation remains controlled, the Federal Reserve is expected to proceed cautiously with rate cuts, focusing on sustaining growth. With the labour market, wage growth, and consumer spending holding firm, the economy shows resilience heading into a pivotal election season, balancing steady expansion with moderated expectations. Recent developments in the cryptocurrency industry reveal both regulatory challenges and notable growth. Immutable, a blockchain gaming platform, announced potential legal action from the SEC concerning its IMX token, as the agency intensifies its scrutiny of crypto assets. Immutable maintains that IMX is not a security and intends to defend its position. Meanwhile, Tether reported record Q3 profits of $2.5 billion, with over $120 billion USDt in circulation and $102.5 billion in US Treasuries, highlighting its financial stability and extensive reserves. CEO Paolo Ardoino underscored Tether’s strategic investments and commitment to liquidity. In Florida, the CFO of the state pension fund, Jimmy Patronis has said he supports expanding the state’s $800 million crypto portfolio as a hedge against federal control, suggesting this could increase if former President Trump is re-elected. It is further evidence of the evolving role of cryptocurrency in financial systems and policy debates, emphasising its growing influence on economic stability. Happy Trading!

35666851,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=100381,1730729746,"Bernstein Says Bitcoin to $200,000 Is Certain Regardless of US Elections Outcome","Analysts at Bernstein have released a new Bitcoin price outlook, predicting that the asset would trade at $200,000 by the end of 2025 regardless of the US election outcome. Gautam Chhugani, Bernstein’s Senior Analyst on crypto assets, made the latest assertion on the US election eve, insisting that the Tuesday event would not impact Bitcoin’s long-term outlook. In a statement to clients, he emphasized that the crypto firstborn’s surge to $200,000 by the end of 2025 is almost programmed.The analyst based his price call on several critical factors, arguing that “the Bitcoin genie is out of the bottle, and it is hard to reverse this course.” Chhugani stated that surging US debts, bad monetary decisions, and the growing demand from the US spot exchange-traded funds would drive Bitcoin to the $200,000 price target.Notably, the brokerage firm called a similar Bitcoin price late last month, noting the six-figure target was conservative. However, the latest commentary suggests that the factors driving the impending price upsurge are so strong that the US election would not be able to sway it.Expect Short-Term Volatility: BernsteinChhugani noted that the global market, including crypto, would experience a short-term price action depending on tomorrow’s election outcome. The market expert reiterated that a win for Republican candidate Donald Trump would spur a break above Bitcoin’s current all-time high of around $74,000 to trade between $80,000 and $90,000.However, Chhugani changed his earlier stance on Democratic nominee Kamala Harris’ win, predicting a softer market reaction. He raised his expectations from between $30,000 and $40,000 to $50,000 before the 2025-end recovery.Meanwhile, the Polymarket odds between Trump and Harris converged during the weekend. The former president lost his 33% lead over Harris, with the stakes dropping by 15% at 57.9% to 42.1%.Notably, the lead correction correlated with a Bitcoin downtrend. The pioneering cryptocurrency dropped below $68,000 yesterday before recovering to $69,051. However, it is still down 6.1% from last week’s high at $73,544.Bitcoin to $200,000 Confirmed?It bears mentioning that Bernstein is not the first to predict a surge to $200,000 regardless of tomorrow’s election outcome. Notably, prominent multinational bank Standard Chartered also shares a similar narrative.The bank’s head of digital assets research, Geoff Kendrick, predicted that Bitcoin’s push to $200,000 is independent of the US elections. He also cited growing demand and interest rate cuts from the US Federal Reserve as catalysts for the expected upsurge.Other industrial leaders also expect Bitcoin to trade at the price mark, with a few targeting at least six figures by the end of next year. Steve Lubka, a Swan Bitcoin executive, asserted a conservative $100,000 for Bitcoin by 2025.Meanwhile, Bitcoin is the only crypto asset expected to see new highs regardless of the outcome of the US election. Chhugani noted that Ethereum and Solana’s price performance depends on the regulatory tone of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, which may be decided in the November 5 poll.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | ETH | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/04/bernstein-says-bitcoin-to-200000-is-certain-regardless-of-us-elections-outcome/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=bernstein-says-bitcoin-to-200000-is-certain-regardless-of-us-elections-outcome,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

35663720,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=100380,1730729103,Bitcoin Shows Mixed Signals on US Election Eve Amid Whale Accumulation and LTH Sales,"Bitcoin is again in a very decisive position, showing both promising and cautionary signals on the eve of the U.S. election. Recall that a surge last week saw Bitcoin jump to $73,600 on Oct. 29, marking a seven-month peak before a swift correction pulled it down below $68,000 by Nov. 3. Despite the decline, major market indicators point to ongoing interest and potential volatility.Bitcoin Market Healthy Amid Whale Buys and LTH SalesIn the derivatives markets, there are encouraging signs of stability. Traders are holding their positions, steering clear of excessive leverage , which suggests a healthier, more sustainable trajectory for Bitcoin compared to past speculative booms. A notable metric, the 25% delta skew, remains stable. This figure typically rises sharply above 7% in times of market panic, indicating that, as of now, options traders are not bracing for a major price drop. Meanwhile, activity from large Bitcoin Whales continues to shape market sentiment. According to CryptoQuant data , whale holdings have risen, increasing from 3.889 million BTC on Oct. 20 to 3.915 million BTC currently. This uptick suggests confidence even amid recent market fluctuations. Bitcoin 1 Year Change in Whales Holdings of Bitcoin Bitcoin Whale Holdings | CryptoQuant While whales accumulate , long-term holders (LTHs) are taking a different approach, showing a noticeable uptick in selling. Over the past week, LTHs have offloaded around 177,617 BTC, according to CryptoQuant analyst JA Maartun. https://twitter.com/JA_Maartun/status/1853393806583861340This behavior syncs with a historical trend where LTHs tend to sell when prices rise, possibly hinting that these holders see current price levels as an opportunity to realize profits. This selling trend mirrors patterns observed in previous bull markets, including those in 2018, 2021, and 2024, where long-term holders distributed more Bitcoin during price rallies.Macro FactorsBitcoin’s recent price movements have also closely followed trends in the S&P 500 , suggesting that macro factors are influencing its price. The upcoming U.S. elections and a potential interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve—forecasted at 0.25%—are possible catalysts for further market shifts. A Federal Reserve rate cut could boost Bitcoin’s appeal, as lower interest rates often lead to a search for alternative stores of value, driving investment in assets like Bitcoin.Bitcoin Shows Mixed Signals as US Election LoomsAdding to the anticipation, some market experts predict Bitcoin could reach new highs following the U.S. elections. Analyst Moustache noted on X that Bitcoin historically has surged after past elections in 2012, 2016, and 2020, speculating that 2024 could follow a similar trend.https://twitter.com/el_crypto_prof/status/1853370462803267757However, as reported earlier today by The Crypto Basic, Aksel Kibar, a Chartered Market Technician, highlighted a potentially bearish formation in Bitcoin’s chart, referred to as a Gravestone Doji. If confirmed, this pattern could signal a further pullback. Whether this pattern materializes depends on how Bitcoin closes the current week. A weak close would confirm the doji, but a strong finish could invalidate it, opening the door for further gains.Despite recent price volatility, some analysts believe Bitcoin is building a solid base around the $69,000 level. They argue that this correction is part of a healthy market cycle and could serve as a foundation for a more significant breakout. The idea is that this consolidation phase may prime Bitcoin to surpass its all-time high if buying pressure resumes. BTC currently changes hands at $68,913 as of press time, looking to reclaim and sustain the $69,000 territory before the U.S. presidential election tomorrow.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/04/bitcoin-shows-mixed-signals-on-us-election-eve-amid-whale-accumulation-and-lth-sales/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=bitcoin-shows-mixed-signals-on-us-election-eve-amid-whale-accumulation-and-lth-sales,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

35661597,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=651491,1730727051,"ADA Slips Below $0.3389 Level, Deeper Downtrend Looming?","Cardano (ADA) has once more dropped below the crucial $0.3389 support level, sparking fears of an extended bearish phase. This level has previously held strong as a line of defense for ADA, but its recent breach suggests that sellers may be gaining the upper hand. With ADA navigating lower levels, investors are left questioning whether this slip could open the door to a deeper downtrend. As bears tighten their grip, this article aims to analyze the recent decline of ADA below the critical $0.3389 support level and evaluate the likelihood of a deeper downtrend unfolding. By exploring technical signals and market dynamics, this piece will provide readers with a clear understanding of ADA’s current position, potential risks, and paths forward in the face of mounting bearish pressure. Technical Analysis: Is ADA Set For Further Slide? On the 4-hour chart, ADA has recently broken below the $0.3389 mark, with its price now exhibiting strong bearish momentum as it trades beneath the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). This positioning under the SMA is a key indicator of a possible prolonged downside move, suggesting that sellers are currently in control. If selling pressure persists, the $0.2388 level will become an important area to monitor. Also, the 4-hour Composite Trend Oscillator for ADA is displaying negative signals, as both the SMA line and the signal line have dropped below the zero level and are nearing the oversold zone. Typically, this movement indicates that selling pressure is intensifying, showing that sellers are becoming increasingly dominant in the market. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Eyes a Potential Recovery: Can It Bounce Back? On the daily chart, Cardano is exhibiting pronounced downward strength, highlighted by a bearish candlestick pattern that signifies increased selling pressure below the $0.3389 mark. This pattern indicates that sellers are firmly in control of the market, relentlessly driving the price lower, prompting a strong likelihood of further losses in the near term. An in-depth examination of the 1-day Composite Trend Oscillator reveals that Cardano is likely poised for prolonged losses. Following its failure to break above the SMA line, the signal line is descending and moving into the oversold zone, indicating a significant negative shift in momentum. If this downward trend continues, Cardano may face considerable challenges in staging a recovery, which could lead to an extended period of sluggish price movement. Key Levels To Watch In The Coming Days As Cardano faces a challenging market landscape, investors must monitor several key levels in the coming days. Attention should be directed toward the support level at $0.2388, which may provide crucial protection against additional downturns. Should ADA sustain its position above this threshold, it could pave the way for a potential recovery, aiming for the $0.3389 level and even higher. Related Reading: Bullish Analyst Sees Cardano (ADA) Rising 13% As Key Indicator Signals Buy Conversely, if ADA falls below the $0.2388 support level, it may indicate a deeper bearish trend, leading to possible declines toward other support levels and triggering heightened selling pressure.

This sparked widespread optimism in the community on the asset’s mainstream adoption. The crypto market leader has grown into a hedge against inflation for many investors as macroeconomic factors cripple the hold on fiat currencies. Days leading up to the U.S. Presidential elections have seen candidate campaigns on crypto circulate social media spaces. Trump: Bitcoin Does Not Threaten the DollarA speech made by Trump at the Bitcoin Conference 2024 has regained popularity with users pointing to the growth over the years. At the conference, Trump noted that Bitcoin is not threatening the dollar as claimed by many policy makers. Over the years, global authorities have criticized the top digital asset for affecting fiscal policies and driving investment abroad. This has also coincided with the creation of Central Bank Digital Currencies ( CBDCs ) in several jurisdictions. The global adoption of Bitcoin and the surge in the decentralized finance (DeFi) scene rattled central banks with several holders moving away from fiat.Meanwhile, according to the Republican candidate, the behavior of the current US government is what poses a threat to the dollar. This is due to increased spending coupled with inflation and a rising debt profile. As a result, several crypto enthusiasts have turned to Bitcoin as a haven to preserve currency values. “ Bitcoin is not threatening the dollar, the behavior of the current US President is threatening the dollar,” Trump argued.Recently, US billionaire, Paul Tudor hinted that all roads lead to inflation, adding that he is going long on Bitcoin and gold. Trump to Fire Gary Gensler Another part of the widely circulated clip shows Trump promising to fire Gary Gensler if he wins the upcoming elections. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chairman has become less popular among crypto enthusiasts following a series of tough regulatory decisions. First, the US space lacks clear rules, creating a gap in the system. This drives developers to other rule-making jurisdictions. The Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) rules have attracted participants to Europe with executives hailing the landmark law. Secondly, the Gensler-led SEC has filed a plethora of lawsuits against firms and project leaders in the United States. Tight regulation creates fear in the market and further bolster selling pressure.

42373435,0XGGWk56kaPxudnYllDWRx,1730725260,First Mover Americas: BTC Little Changed as U.S. Election Enters Final Stretch,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  CoinDesk 20 Index: 2,008.80 +0.39%  Bitcoin (BTC): $68,897.73 +0.86%  Ether (ETH): $2,473.42 +0.81%  S&P 500: 5,728.80 +0.41%  Gold: $2,742.19 +0.38%  Nikkei 225: 38,053.67 -2.63%  Top Stories  Bitcoin and other major cryptos traded little changed on the final day before the U.S. presidential election. BTC edged back toward $69,000, around 0.8% higher in the last 24 hours. The broader digital asset market was more muted, rising less than 0.5%. From being a few dollars away from a new record last week, bitcoin pulled back to a low of $67,600 on Sunday, seemingly in tandem with a retreat in the more pro-crypto Donald Trump's chances of election victory. With only hours remaining before the first polls open in some eastern states, it seems traders are sitting on their hands until they have a clearer picture of where this one is headed.  Perceived winning odds of Democrat Kamala Harris continue to rise on betting platform Polymarket, with users buying and selling hundreds of thousands of favored shares in a bump for market activity. Shares of Harris winning the election surged to 43 cents ahead of Tuesday’s vote, up from 33 cents on Oct. 30. Republican Donald Trump’s shares fell, dropping from 66 cents to 57 cents. Meanwhile, polling aggregator Real Clear Polling gives Trump a microscopic edge at 48.5%-48.4%. The increase in Harris' odds might be due to traders hedging their bets, according to a CoinDesk analysis, with a study of trades above $10,000 suggesting both large bets on Harris and strategic trading to protect against a Trump loss.  Singapore's central bank said it will introduce new measures to advance tokenization in financial services. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) wishes to form commercial networks to deepen liquidity of tokenized assets, develop an ecosystem of market infrastructures, foster industry frameworks for tokenized asset implementation and enable access to common settlement facilities for tokenized assets. ""We are encouraged by the keen participation from financial institutions and fellow policymakers to co-create industry standards and risk management frameworks to facilitate commercial deployment of tokenized capital markets products, and scale tokenized markets on an industry wide basis,” Leong Sing Chiong, deputy managing director for markets and development, said.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows yields on the U.S. 10-year note and the three-month bill, the spread between the two and the S&P 500 since 1985.  The spread is fast de-inverting, just 20 basis points short of normalizing or turning positive.  Previous de-inversions were characterized by a renewed downtrend in the S&P 500 and presaged U.S. recessions marked by vertical shaded portions.  The latest de-inversion, however, may not be bearish for stocks and other risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, as it is accompanied by an acceleration in money supply, which tends to be a bullish signal for scarce digital assets like bitcoin, André Dragosch, Bitwise's director, head of research for Europe.

In a November 3 post, Kenobi insisted that Shiba Inu has been dynamic and continues to outperform his expectations in its four years of existence. He stressed how hard it is to come by a project with similar exceptional innovation.Furthermore, Kenobi lauded Shiba Inu’s pseudonymous founders, who launched the meme coin with a “meticulously planned and engineered” purpose that is rare among today’s projects. He noted that the precision of creation and capital deployment shows that the creators fully understood blockchain technology and how to use it to effectively create financial freedom.Analyst Says Shiba Inu Surge Will Happen SoonWhile applauding Shiba Inu’s rare technology, Kenobi asserted that he sees a repeat of the famous January 2021 rally. For context, SHIB resumed an explosive rally that month, with the bullish momentum driving the meme coin to extraordinary highs.Shiba Inu surged 89,030% in 280 days from January 25, 2021 , peaking at its current all-time of $0.0000845 nine months later. The explosive run pushed SHIB into the top 10 ranking by market cap, with the token accruing a $38 billion valuation.Kenobi expects a similar surge in the Shiba Inu price, projecting it might “even happen sooner.” While he does not present a particular price target, he remains bullish on an uptrend. However, in the unlikely event that the 89,030% rally fully repeats, this will push the second-largest meme coin to $0.0149 and its market cap to $8.8 trillion.Furthermore, the market expert asserted that Shiba Inu surpassing the $100 billion market cap by the end of this bull cycle is a possibility. He added that the meme coin will reenter the top 10 crypto market cap ranking, projecting at least a two-step move from 12th place in the current market.Notably, a prediction of a possible SHIB surge to above $0.01 is not new. Shiba Inu’s marketing lead, Lucie, asserted that the leading meme coin will eventually reach the price mark sometime in the future.Analyst Asserts Shiba Inu Will Rival DogecoinMeanwhile, Kenobi has predicted a hotly contested top slot in the meme coin sector this bull cycle. The analyst believes that Shiba Inu is a real competitor for Dogecoin and expects a keenly-competed battle.However, the pseudonymous expert insisted that the chances of Shiba Inu outperforming Dogecoin in this bull cycle remain even. He asserted that Shiba Inu has an equal chance of outdoing Dogecoin.In the meantime, Dogecoin’s 38% upsurge in the past 30 days has seen it occupy the 8th slot, with a market cap of $22 billion, more than double Shiba Inu’s current valuation.

35660459,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=100361,1730723959,Peter Brandt Projects $97K Bitcoin Target Following Major Triangle Breakout,"Veteran trader Peter Brandt has noted that Bitcoin recently broke out of a triangle pattern, highlighting a bullish prospect with a target above $97,000. Despite experiencing a notable price dip below the $68,500 mark, Bitcoin's broader bullish structure, which has been forming since September, remains intact. In a recent analysis, Brandt identified potential targets for Bitcoin as the market progresses.For context, between March and September 2024, Bitcoin's price chart revealed an inverted triangle pattern characterized by converging trendlines of lower highs and higher lows. This often indicates consolidation before a breakout.Bitcoin Breaks Out Remarkably, a market chart shared by Brandt shows that Bitcoin recently broke out of this triangle pattern precisely last week when Bitcoin surpassed $73,500. This move above the upper trendline resistance suggests a significant bullish shift.Following this breakout, Bitcoin signals a potential upward trend, with a target price of $97,056, according to Brandt. However, the seasoned analyst emphasized that specific criteria must be met to validate a breakout.https://twitter.com/PeterLBrandt/status/1852354366499332292 Criteria for Confirming BreakoutsBrandt has pointed out that not all breaches of trendlines qualify as genuine breakouts. According to his analysis, price action must satisfy defined conditions. Specifically, on the daily chart, Bitcoin's price must close above $76,000 to confirm the breakout above the March high.Brandt noted that this confirmation should occur at midnight on Sunday to validate the move. However, on Sunday, November 3, Bitcoin did not achieve a daily close above $76,000, as required to confirm the breakout above the March high. Instead, Bitcoin's price experienced a slight decline, closing at $68,741 after it had dipped to $67,482.Meanwhile, Brandt noted that diagonal patterns with slanted boundary lines can be tricky to trade, as slight touches to the boundary lines do not automatically constitute breakouts. While Bitcoin's recent breakout is promising, Brandt observed that additional effort is required to maintain bullish momentum.Brandt Bitcoin Price Targets from Previous AnalysesIn his previous market assessments, Brandt outlined three distinct price targets for Bitcoin based on various analytical approaches. He first noted a target of $94,000, stemming from an inverted expanding triangle pattern analyzed on a semi-logarithmic scale.Initially perceived as bearish, this pattern has shifted to present a bullish outlook. The $94,000 projection is derived by measuring the triangle's height and applying it from the breakout level. If Bitcoin holds above $70,000, this price could serve as a new support zone.The second, more ambitious target is $230,000. This was calculated by projecting price movements from the low in November 2022 to the high in March 2024 and then applying that range starting from August 2024.Although this outlook is considered more aspirational, Brandt highlighted that focusing on one target at a time is best. His third target is $160,000, based on the recurring cycle symmetry in Bitcoin's historical market patterns.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/04/peter-brandt-projects-97k-bitcoin-target-following-major-triangle-breakout/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=peter-brandt-projects-97k-bitcoin-target-following-major-triangle-breakout,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Steph, an analyst under the “StephIsCrypto” username, offers a bold, positive outlook for XRP, saying that a significant price rally is in the pipeline thanks to increased global liquidity. Related Reading: Solana DeFi Momentum Soars With $5.7 Billion Locked In Q3 In a published analysis, Steph highlighted the token’s historical relationship with increased liquidity and structural patterns like the descending channel and the Bollinger Bands. According to Steph, these are the primary factors that set up XRP for a price ascent soon. At the time of writing, XRP was trading at $0.5052, up 0.5% in the last 24 hours, but sustained a nearly 2% rally in the last week, data from Coingecko shows. XRP And Its Relationship With Global Liquidity Higher global liquidity often favors Ripple’s XRP, fueling price rallies. In Steph’s analysis, a token’s liquidity, or the available cash flow across the market, traditionally helps XRP sustain price action in past cycles. BUY #XRP BEFORE IT HITS $14.00 !!! pic.twitter.com/e8wY3UVq11 — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) November 3, 2024 Steph is now looking at the same trajectory, where global liquidity is increasing thanks to favorable policies from central banks. He cites the possible move of the Federal Reserve, which can introduce additional money into circulation, thus weakening the fiat currencies but creating more capital. Steph sees the token as a great investment when the liquidity surge happens. As Weighted Global Liquidity Index Moves Up, Riskier Assets Increase Steph’s thesis on XRP is also based on the Weighted Global Liquidity Index (WGLI) movement. The WGLI tracks the world’s money supply by looking at central banks’ balance sheets and other important financial statements. The analyst argues that the index reflects possible price movements of risky assets, like XRP. If the index trends upward, crypto assets tend to increase as well. According to the analyst, every XRP price surge happened immediately after an increase in the index. Currently, there’s a divergence between XRP’s price and the index. Although there’s an increase in global liquidity, XRP’s price appears stable. But for Steph, this setup acts as his bullish signal. Bollinger Bands Squeeze And Descending Channel Favor SRP According to Steph, even the Bollinger Bands and Descending Channel set up the altcoin for a favorable run. Since 2021, XRP has been trading in a descending channel, with multiple resistance price points and declining volumes. Related Reading: GRASS Token Fails To Break $2 Level – Is It Time To Buy? He pointed out that the asset’s Bollinger Bands are compressed. If the bands tighten in crypto, it suggests a probable price action. For example, XRP’s Bollinger Bands compressed in 2017, which was followed by the asset’s price rally. If the analysis and data trends hold true, the analyst expects XRP to trade at $14, translating to an increase of 2,670%.

BTC is undervalued compared with previous cycles, measuring from either the cycle low or since the halving.  Crypto markets are likely to remain volatile as we await the result of Tuesday's U.S. presidential election. Over the short term, this will probably dictate crypto’s price movements. However, once the situation settles down, bitcoin {{BTC}} is likely to experience a significant rally if the pattern from previous votes is repeated.  Bitcoin, created in 2009, is about to experience its fourth U.S. election. Data from the three previous times shows the largest cryptocurrency has always rallied subsequently and never dropped back to its election-day price. If this trend reoccurs, the BTC price should peak in about a year's time.  Read More: Here's Why Today's U.S. Election Matters for Crypto  U.S. election is a bullish catalyst for bitcoin  2012  In the 2012 U.S. election, which also took place on Nov. 5, bitcoin was hovering around $11. The top of the cycle occurred in November 2013, which saw the price rocket by almost 12,000%, with bitcoin climbing to over $1,100.  2016  Fast-forward four years. During the first week of November, the price of bitcoin was approximately $700. It peaked in December 2017 at around $18,000, appreciating about 3,600%.  2020  After the most recent vote, the November 2020 election that coincided with the Covid-19 pandemic, bitcoin rallied 478% to a market top of around $69,000 a year later. It hit a record high over $73,000 in March 2024.  After each event, with the price of bitcoin so much higher than four years before, the size of the jump has dropped, providing diminishing returns. The percentage decrease between the first and second number is 70%. Between the second and third it's 87%. If we extend the trend and assume that this time the decrease will be around 90%, that implies a post-election rally of about 47.8%. That would take bitcoin to about $103,500 in fourth-quarter 2025.  More room for growth  Keep in mind that bitcoin is currently undervalued compared with previous cycles. That's the case whether we measure it from the cycle low, which took place during the collapse of FTX in November 2022, as the graph below shows, or from April's mining-reward halving.

Analyst Reveals Bear Case That Could Send Price To $28,000","Speculations about the Bitcoin bull market being over have been rife in the crypto market, particularly as the price has failed to reach its March all-time high of above $73,000. Providing a more compelling case to this narrative, a crypto analyst has released a Bitcoin bear case scenario that could see the pioneer cryptocurrency decline to $28,000. Bitcoin Bear Case Unveiled In an X (formerly Twitter) post, crypto analyst and Position trader Bob Loukas revealed a “Bitcoin bear case,” unveiling a more unorthodox and bearish scenario for Bitcoin than most analysts have suggested. Basing his bearish scenarios on the cycle theory, Loukas proposes that Bitcoin might be part of the broader 16-year cycle, with the current market marking the final four-year phase of this cycle. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Burn Rate Surge 24,271% While Shibarium Transactions Spike, Catalyst For Rally To $0.00008? The analyst suggested that this four-year phase could end in two ways — a distribution phase, where prices peak and then decline, or an upward phase, where Bitcoin experiences one last upsurge before a downturn begins. Loukas has revealed that while cycle trends can help predict or provide insights into a cryptocurrency’s future price movements, he emphasizes that “no power law” guarantees that an asset’s price will continually go up. The analyst aims to desensitize investors into believing Bitcoin will forever be bullish with no downturns. He asserts that a bear cycle is inevitable at some point, though the timing remains uncertain. Loukas pinpointed specific price movements in his Bitcoin chart that could serve as a bearish signal, suggesting a potential downturn. The analyst predicts that Bitcoin could drop to new lows around $28,500 by 2026. He also forecasted that after a period of volatility consisting of price declines and surges, the cryptocurrency could rise again to $59,500 by 2027. For more clarity, Loukas has proposed a narrative, suggesting that if Bitcoin were to close below the 10-month Moving Average (MA) during a “bull market,” it would be a cause for concern. Similarly, a monthly close below the $58,800 mark could indicate the start of a potential downward spiral. The crypto analyst has estimated a 10% to 15% chance of this bearish scenario occurring, emphasizing that it was a possibility and not a certainty. He clarified that while he believes the current market cycle leans towards a more bullish scenario based on historical evidence, he always considers alternative scenarios. This approach is likely due to the crypto market’s inherent unpredictability and notorious volatility. Related Reading: Dogecoin Bollinger Bands Squeezes Tighter Than It Was Before 2021 Rally, What This Means Analyst Sees Retail Activity Fueling A BTC Downtrend While unveiling his Bitcoin bear case scenario, Loukas disclosed that broader interest in cryptocurrencies outside of Bitcoin has faded significantly. He revealed that there is a lack of new retail investors, and this weakening enthusiasm could pose a serious challenge for Bitcoin to generate new capital for growth. According to Loukas, retail investors’ disinterest may stem from a shift in sentiment. Embracing cryptocurrencies has dwindled to mere speculation, and fewer people believe in their transformative potential.

Could this lead to a breakout rally towards $6? With increased bearish pressure, Toncoin has returned to the crucial support zone around $4.65. As bearish dominance suggests a negative crossover in the EMAs, the risk of a breakdown rises.Will Toncoin bounce back from the $4.65 support zone to fly past the overhead trendline? Let’s find out. Toncoin Nears Triangle BreakoutThe Toncoin is maintaining a declining trend in the daily chart and is under immense bearish pressure. However, despite the pressure, the crucial support at $4.65 holds the TON price firm. The demand zone at $4.65 coincides with a descending triangle pattern. The increasing bearish influence has resulted in a death cross event between the 50-day and 200-day EMAs. Toncoin Price Chart Moreover, the 100-day and 200-day EMAs are approaching a bearish crossover. This adds to the bearish signals, with the MACD and signal lines aligned in the negative territory, showing a gradual trend in negative histograms.Overall, the daily chart for Toncoin presents an extremely bearish outlook. However, the underlying dynamics at the critical support level of $4.65 suggest the possibility of a bullish comeback.The daily RSI line indicates a bearish divergence as Toncoin finds support near the demand zone. With an intraday gain of 0.41%, Toncoin is currently trading at $4.84, hinting at a potential bullish recovery.Will Toncoin Reclaim $6?As Toncoin approaches the apex of the descending triangle pattern, the likelihood of a high-momentum move increases. If broader market conditions improve after the U.S. elections , Toncoin could surpass the 20-day EMA, which aligns with the overhead resistance trendline.According to price action analysis, a triangle breakout rally may encounter resistance near the $5.33 level before reaching the psychological mark of $6. A successful breakout could further enhance the chances of Toncoin climbing to $8.18.On the flip side, a breakdown below $4.65 would test the $4.34 level before potentially reaching the psychological support at $4.00.",NEUTRAL,TON,MARKET | TRADING | TON,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/04/will-toncoin-ton-hold-at-4-65-trigger-a-triangle-breakout/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=will-toncoin-ton-hold-at-4-65-trigger-a-triangle-breakout,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

It is, in fact, a separate company: Fidelity International.  Global bank Citigroup (C) and Fidelity International, an $862 billion asset manager, have developed a proof-of-concept for an on-chain money-market fund that includes a digital foreign exchange swap.  Their aim is to enable real-time settlement of multi-currency transactions, enhancing treasury management by eliminating delays and improving liquidity. The solution will be showcased at the Singapore FinTech Festival 2024, according to a Monday press release from the companies.  By tokenizing money-market funds and using blockchain technology, Citi and Fidelity International — which is separate from the better-known Fidelity Investments — aim to facilitate faster, seamless transactions, allowing investors to manage FX risks more efficiently. This advancement could enable corporate treasurers to diversify portfolios and access higher yields on U.S. dollar-denominated MMFs while maintaining liquidity.  The collaboration is part of the Monetary Authority of Singapore's Project Guardian, which explores blockchain's potential in financial markets.  This move aligns with a broader trend in traditional finance, as major players like BlackRock and other established institutions embrace tokenization as a way to enhance operational efficiency, offer new investment opportunities, and stay competitive in a rapidly evolving market.

The crypto market expects to witness a ""Moonvember"" rally, but uncertainties are increasing amid the U.S. Presidential elections. In this context, KCS, the native token of the KuCoin exchange, appears to be on the brink of a breakout rally. As the tug-of-war between bulls and bears continues, centralized exchange (CEX) tokens like KCS may benefit from increased speculation. This uptick is driven by rising volumes on exchanges, which boosts demand for their native tokens. So, will the KuCoin token (KCS) experience a surge in this uncertain market? Let’s explore.KuCoin Token (KCS) Price AnalysisThe KCS price is showing signs of recovery on the 4-hour chart and is close to surpassing the $9 mark. After starting its recovery rally in early October from $7.37, the KuCoin token is currently trading at $8.97, marking a significant surge of 21.58%. KuCoin Token (KCS) Price Chart The recovery rally peaked at $9.37 but experienced a quick reversal on Wednesday due to broader market influences. Currently, the price is in a sideways trend between two crucial volume zones at $8.97 and the $9 psychological mark, indicating a consolidation phase.Despite this sideways trend, underlying bullish support suggests the formation of a double-bottom pattern. The neckline of this bullish pattern aligns with the $9 psychological mark. Additionally, the trend-based Fibonacci analysis indicates that the 23.60% Fibonacci level coincides with the $9 mark.Will KuCoin Token Reach $10?The ongoing recovery as it challenges the $9 mark will generate a strong buying signal if it surpasses this high supply zone. Supporting this bullish breakout, the MACD and signal lines have shown a bullish crossover, accompanied by an increase in positive histogram values.As the broader crypto market anticipates a ""Moonvember"" rally, a breakout for the KuCoin token is likely to reach the 50% Fibonacci level at $9.51. In the longer term, the $10 psychological mark could be a realistic target by the end of the month.Conversely, if the $8.75 support zone fails to hold, potential support levels for the KuCoin token may drop to $8.60 and $8.35.",POSITIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | KSC,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/04/kucoin-token-eyes-9-break-as-double-bottom-signals-reversal/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=kucoin-token-eyes-9-break-as-double-bottom-signals-reversal,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

According to Dhairya, Shiba Inu is the top-ranked ERC-20 token on Ethereum in terms of market capitalization. The developer excluded stablecoins like USDC and USDT, which are also ERC-20 tokens, due to their presence on multiple blockchains. However, Dhairya contended that Shiba Inu has remained loyal to Ethereum since its launch, attracting significant value to the blockchain.

Last week, Buterin said Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu’s major rival, deserves to be the second-biggest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin. This suggests that Buterin believes DOGE should rank ahead of ETH, the native coin of the Ethereum blockchain. This comment triggered reactions among Shiba Inu community members, who took to X to air their comments. They believe Buterin should have spoken in favor of SHIB instead of DOGE due to Shiba Inu’s accomplishments on Ethereum. While Shiba Inu officially launched on Ethereum, Dogecoin made its debut using the Litecoin architecture. Kusama Wants to Showcase SHIB Potential to Buterin Amid the debate, Shiba Inu’s lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama, requested to showcase SHIB’s potential to Buterin in a 10-minute pitch. Kusama hinted that the presentation will highlight Shiba Inu’s technologies, dedicated community, and decentralized governance system. The lead developer urged Shiba Inu enthusiasts to call Buterin’s attention to his request. Shiba Inu is the Best-Performing Asset Globally Expectedly, Shiba Inu community members complied with the directive, tagging and mentioning Buterin in different X posts. While urging Buterin to contact Kusama, famous community figure Digarch claimed that SHIB is the best-performing asset in the world. This claim aligns with a similar view Kusama shared recently. As reported earlier, Kusama suggested that Shiba Inu is the best-performing asset globally over the last decade, outperforming other financial instruments like Bitcoin and Tesla stock. On October 30, Kusama claimed that SHIB had registered a lifetime gain of 33,774,726%. According to Kusama, Shiba Inu outperformed Bitcoin’s growth by a whopping 6,600% (66x). Shiba Inu has undoubtedly witnessed an incredible performance since its launch in August 2020. The token surged by over 153 million percent in 14 months, from August 1, 2020, to October 28, 2021. This saw SHIB’s price surge from an initial price of $0.000000000056 to an all-time high of $0.00008616. SHIB is currently trading at $0.00001677, down 80.6% from its ATH.

35660452,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=100330,1730712837,Expert Predicts Timeline for XRP Bull Run Based on Global Liquidity,"As the crypto market gears up for a new phase in the ongoing season, influential analyst Steph has asserted that XRP will not be left out this time. Although the ongoing bull season has lasted for a year, XRP remains within the same range it occupied before the market-wide surge began. In this context, Steph has disclosed his bold price projection for XRP in the next market phase and a timeline for when this might occur.XRP Bull Run Based on Global LiquidityCiting historical trends, Steph suggests that XRP may be primed for a substantial price surge within the last eight weeks of 2024 and into 2025. According to him, rising global liquidity would drive the potential rally for XRP.In a post on X, Steph shared a chart indicating that significant price movements in XRP have historically correlated with increases in global liquidity. The chart highlighted two key periods: the 2017/2018 cycle and the 2020/2021 cycle, during which supposed boosts in global liquidity led to explosive gains in XRP's value. Notably, the speculated increases in global liquidity during the 2017/2018 cycle propelled XRP to an all-time high. Another significant run occurred later when XRP neared $2 in 2021.According to the analyst, the end of 2024 and the beginning of 2025 could represent a similar setup, with increased liquidity catalyzing a new rally in XRP. “2024-2025 could be the start of something massive,” he said.This idea hinges on the notion that rising global liquidity fuels investment across markets, and XRP, as a top-ranking utility coin, may particularly benefit from this influx. Steph’s projection of an XRP bull run in 2025 aligns with the perspective of some market watchers, who speculate that XRP’s surge may correlate with the end of the current bull season , which is expected to conclude in 2025.Projected XRP PriceAccording to his chart, Steph anticipates that XRP could surge above $6 with the projected rise in global liquidity. XRP is currently valued at $0.5058, which implies a potential increase of over 1,086%.However, Steph’s optimistic outlook on XRP has faced skepticism from some market participants. Critics have dismissed his projections, arguing that XRP would struggle to surpass $0.55, noting that previous forecasts of an uptrend for XRP have not materialized.",POSITIVE,XRP,MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/04/expert-predicts-timeline-for-xrp-bull-run-based-on-global-liquidity/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=expert-predicts-timeline-for-xrp-bull-run-based-on-global-liquidity,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

35660450,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=100313,1730712489,US Election and FOMC Week Set Bitcoin Up for Likely $100K Surge: Analysis,"Bitcoin faces volatility amid U.S. election week, with the potential for a surge to $100,000 post-election. Bitcoin declined over the weekend after nearing its all-time high, prompting some short-term traders to secure profits. The pullback brought the price down to nearly $67,000, yet market analysts remain confident in its longer-term trajectory. Notably, on-chain insights provider Spot On Chain indicated that the market might be entering its most volatile week, fueled by the upcoming U.S. presidential election and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. Spot On Chain emphasized that historically, significant gains often follow U.S. elections. This trend suggests that regardless of whether Donald Trump or Kamala Harris secures the presidency, Bitcoin could maintain its upward trajectory, potentially reaching $100,000 by year-end. Bitcoin Historical Trends Post-ElectionA review of past election periods supports the potential for significant price movements. Ali Martinez, a well-known analyst, examined Bitcoin’s trends after the last three presidential elections, suggesting that similar outcomes could be expected this time. In 2012, Bitcoin's price, which started below $12, skyrocketed to $1,137, reflecting an increase of more than 10,640%. The surge showcased how election periods could trigger exponential growth.https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1853295103160279462The 2016 election period demonstrated another steep upward trend. Bitcoin began the year in the hundreds and soared throughout 2017, peaking near $20,000 by the end of that year. This growth marked an approximate 2,698% increase, underscoring the crypto’s capacity for dramatic price appreciation after elections. Further, following the 2020 election, Bitcoin started at around $14,000 and reached about $69,000 by late 2021, representing a growth of 386.07%. This sequence of data points underlines the consistent pattern of post-election rallies.Potential Short-Term ReactionsIn anticipation of the upcoming election, analyst Miles Deutscher provided insights on potential short-term market reactions. He noted that the election outcome could significantly influence Bitcoin's immediate price movements.Specifically, a Trump victory might lead to a dramatic price surge, while a win by Harris could dampen immediate momentum. Deutscher also suggested that a Harris win might shift focus toward altcoins, driven by pre-election de-risking and subsequent FOMO-driven investments. Nonetheless, he asserted regardless of the winner, Bitcoin would attain $100,000 post-election.Analysts speculated that a Trump administration might take a more lenient approach to crypto regulations, potentially benefiting sectors like decentralized finance (DeFi) and revenue-sharing projects.",POSITIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/04/us-election-and-fomc-week-set-bitcoin-up-for-likely-100k-surge-analysis/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=us-election-and-fomc-week-set-bitcoin-up-for-likely-100k-surge-analysis,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Hoskinson was involved in another heated X spat, during which the Cardano community questioned his sense of leadership and responsibility. For context, the IOG founder shared a Taptool link to a meme coin created in response to his Halloween costume.However, the creators of the WALDE meme coin rug pulled investors, selling the token’s liquidity a few hours after Hoskinson teased it. Following the scam, members of the Cardano community rained insults on the founder, alleging he shilled an unproven token and influenced buyers’ decisions.Hoskinson RepliesThe Cardano founder attempted to address the issue, stating in a tweet that he had nothing to do with the project and did not promote the meme coin. He argued that he only mentioned the WALDE token because it was created to mimic his Halloween custom.Amidst the growing criticisms, with a user insinuating that Hoskinson is the cancer of Cardano, the founder decided to put it to a poll. Hoskinson asked in the survey if he is really Cardano’s problem and gave the community seven days to respond.https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1852869055616864608Interestingly, the poll has 36,441 votes at press time, with 57.1% of voters stating that Hoskinson was not Cardano’s “cancer.” However, a substantial number of them still had contrary views, with 42.9% agreeing the founder was part of the ecosystem’s woes.Meanwhile, Hoskinson has decided to take a break from X throughout the week, stating he wants to disconnect and meditate. He noted that the criticisms and personal comments like “cancer,” “a criminal,” and “evil” were hurtful and beyond what he could endure.Proponents Show SupportAmidst the developing situation, a faction of the Cardano community has thrown in their support for Hoskinson. For instance, IOG core tech Riley appreciated the founder for all he has done for the ecosystem, encouraging him to look past the X poll as it has no Sybil resistance.Dave, one of Cardano’s stake pool operators, supported Hoskinson’s decision to take some time out of the toxic media, noting that “life was too short for this.” Other users also backed Hoskinson, stating he has impacted Cardano in no small way.Notably, Hoskinson had previously bemoaned growing criticisms toward him and the Cardano ecosystem. He once reacted when users stated he was no longer needed after the Chang hard fork . He was also involved in a jab from Bitcoin Maxis over his involvement with the Cardano ecosystem.",NEGATIVE,없음,ADA | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | FORKS,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/04/cardano-founder-says-he-is-going-off-the-grid-after-heated-x-dispute/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=cardano-founder-says-he-is-going-off-the-grid-after-heated-x-dispute,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

35660447,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=100314,1730712023,Ripple Escrow Balance Falls to 38.9B XRP: Here’s What It Means,"The amount of XRP in Ripple’s escrow reserve has reduced significantly to 38.9 billion from the 55 billion coins initially locked in 2017. Ripple recently released its Q3 2024 report , giving its clients an overview of its overall performance and state of the XRP Ledger (XRPL) in the third quarter of 2024. Ripple’s XRP Holdings In the report, Ripple revealed its XRP holdings, including those held in its escrow reserve. As of September 30, 2024, Ripple’s liquid XRP holdings stood at 4,436,713,796 (4.43 billion). In addition, the company’s escrow reserve held 38,900,000,005 (38.9 billion) XRP on September 30. Notably, Ripple’s Q3 report has triggered widespread reactions within the XRP community, with a focus on the escrow reserve. Ripple XRP Holdings Ripple XRP Escrow For context, Ripple made a decision in 2017 to lock 55 billion XRP in several XRPL-based escrow accounts. The 55 billion XRP represents 55% of the coin’s 100 billion supply. This move is part of efforts to control the XRP supply and maintain a stable price. While Ripple programmed the escrow to release 1 billion XRP on the first day of each new month, the company still re-locks 80% of the released funds in escrow. Through this strategy, Ripple’s escrow reserve has drastically dropped to 38.9 billion XRP, representing 38.9% of the coin’s total supply. Experts Highlight Significance of Ripple Escrow Reduction Interestingly, famous legal expert Bill Morgan highlighted the importance of the reduction observed in Ripple’s escrow reserve. According to the lawyer, several arguments have been raised about the company’s escrow. First, Attorney Morgan said the SEC alleged in its lawsuit that Ripple leverages its escrow technique to boost the XRP price, suggesting that a reduction in XRP’s circulating supply might propel the asset for a major price surge.Conversely, Morgan noted that some XRP enthusiasts wrongly claim that Ripple’s escrow reserve suppresses the coin’s price. Following the depletion of Ripple’s escrow reserve, Morgan asserted that the development highlights the company’s responsible stewardship of a large but steadily shrinking XRP holding. Meanwhile, an XRP community member, Tees CryptoSpot, advocated for the need to ‘reallocate’ Ripple’s escrow. The user suggested that once Ripple reallocates its escrow reserve, other entities would be interested in holding XRP, potentially reducing its selling pressure. With more entities holding XRP instead of selling, Tees expects the price of XRP to surge. In the meantime, XRP currently has a circulating supply of 56,868,662,755 (56.86 billion) coins, representing 56.87% of the total supply. The coin is trading at $0.5062, up 0.1% over the past 24 hours.",NEUTRAL,XRP,FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/04/ripple-escrow-balance-falls-to-38-9b-xrp-heres-what-it-means/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=ripple-escrow-balance-falls-to-38-9b-xrp-heres-what-it-means,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

35648408,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=651459,1730709642,"Solana Expected To Reach $500 By Bull Run’s End, Says Crypto Analyst","In an analysis shared on X, popular crypto analyst Gum (@0xGumshoe) is projecting that Solana (SOL) could ascend to $500 by the conclusion of this bull run. This bullish forecast hinges heavily on the outcome of the US presidential election, slated for November 5th, and the potential policy changes that could follow. Solana Price Prediction For This Bull Run @0xGumshoe initiated his forecast with a bold declaration: “SOL TO $500. The upcoming US elections will affect SOL more than any other token. Here’s why I’ve changed my price target.” Delving into the potential scenarios, @0xGumshoe examined the implications of both possible election outcomes—whether Kamala Harris secures the presidency or Donald Trump returns to office. Each scenario presents distinct pathways for Solana’s trajectory. Related Reading: Solana Likely To Target $200 ‘If It Holds Current Support’ – What To Expect In the event of a Kamala Harris victory, @0xGumshoe anticipates a mixed impact on Solana. He noted, “BTC and SOL have outperformed during Biden/Harris,” pointing especially to the performance of the past year under the current administration. The approval of the spot Bitcoin and Ethereum Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) during the Biden/Harris tenure is highlighted by the analyst as a positive factor that could continue to benefit Solana. Additionally, Harris’s supposed commitment to a “less aggressive stance towards crypto” regulation suggests a more favorable environment for the growth of Solana. However, @0xGumshoe also cautioned about potential challenges under a Harris administration. He remarked, “Less regulatory clarity” and a potential new term for SEC Chair Gary Gensler could complicate things for Solana. Furthermore, the possibility of a spot Solana ETF facing rejection and an increase in Bitcoin dominance might overshadow altcoins. Conversely, @0xGumshoe presented a more bullish outlook if Donald Trump wins the election. He asserted, “A Trump win will send Solana to ATHs as the market realizes a SOL ETF will be coming.” The analyst emphasized that unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, Grayscale is unlikely to offload significant amounts of Solana, which could help sustain its price. Additionally, the analyst points to the possibility of establishing a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve and the departure of SEC Chair Gary Gensler as bullish catalysts for SOL. Related Reading: Solana Q3 Digest: Total Value Locked Hits $5.7 Billion, Ranks Third Among Networks However, a Trump victory could also have downsides. @0xGumshoe acknowledged that “higher inflation could eventually end the cycle like in 2021.” Furthermore, he noted Trump’s inherent volatility, stating that the former president “may not do what he promised,” which introduces an element of unpredictability to the projections. In light of these scenarios, @0xGumshoe revised his selling targets for Solana. Previously advocating for a $300 sell target, he now contemplates a higher threshold of $500, contingent upon a Trump win and an increase in macro liquidity. He explained, “If we pair up a Trump win and increase macro liquidity, I will instead sell over time for as long as I believe we hit $500.” The rationale behind the $500 price target is anchored in Solana’s fully diluted valuation (FDV). @0xGumshoe articulated, “At that price, Solana would have a $291B FDV which would put it at the current ETH market cap.” He views this valuation as a significant benchmark, suggesting that Solana’s price could approach Ethereum’s market capitalization unless there is a substantial influx of investments through ETFs, which could propel the token beyond this threshold. Under the Harris administration, @0xGumshoe’s price target for Solana remains at $300. @0xGumshoe concluded his analysis by advising caution, stating, “The elections alone are not enough to predict tops for Solana so take this with a grain of salt. Whatever happens, it is quite obvious that SOL will go far higher with Trump than Harris.” At press time, SOL traded at $161.

DEX traders anticipate a bigger swing in ether.  Market participants position for bullish volatility.  Crypto traders awaiting a surge in bitcoin {{BTC}} price volatility may soon have it their way as derivatives experts suggest the impending U.S. presidential election could trigger price swings matching the dramatic movements of early August.  ""I expect a +1.5-Sigma ($6,000 to $8,000 price range) as a result of the post-election price reaction,"" Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at crypto data tracking platform Amberdata, told CoinDesk.  The projection is based on the annualized forward volatility of 112% derived from the Nov. 6 options trading on Deribit, which suggests a price fluctuation of $4,000 in either direction. A positive 1.5-sigma of that translates to a price swing in the range of $6,000 to $8,000.  Bitcoin last saw a similar price swing in early August when the unwinding of the so-called risk-on yen carry traders led to broad-based risk aversion, sending BTC down to $50,000.  Magadini assumes 1.5-sigma volatility because the latest reports show Republican candidate Donald Trump, perceived to be crypto-friendly, and his rival Democrat Kamala Harris are locked in a tight race in seven swing states.  The 50-50 odds indicate that an eventual outcome is unlikely to surprise markets, irrespective of who wins, implying a low probability of a positive 3-sigma move (three standard deviations from the mean in a normal distribution) looks unlikely. A positive 3-sigma move indicates an extreme event.  Similarly, a sub negative 1-sigma move or minimal price action looks doubtful, as 50-50 odds mean traders won't be able to price the election outcome in advance. The election is due Tuesday, with results expected on Friday.  Recall that volatility is bi-directional, meaning expected price swings could happen in either direction. That said, options traders have been preparing for bullish volatility, purchasing calls at $70,000, $85,000, and $90,000 strikes on Deribit and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. (A $8,000 surge from BTC going market rate of $68,800 would mean new record highs.)  As such, call options are trading pricier than puts in terms of volatility in a sign of bullish sentiment, according to Joshua Lim, co-founder of crypto derivatives trading firm and liquidity provider Arbelos Markets.  ""Bitcoin call options are repricing higher, even while spot price ticks lower this weekend due to surprisingly weak polls for Trump,"" Lim said.  Lim added that the volatility curve is pricing a 7%-8% move around critical events of the week, mainly Thursday's Fed rate decision and the expected U.S. election outcome on Friday.  DEX traders see greater volatility in ETH  Ether {{ETH}}, the native token of Ethereum's blockchain and the world's second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, has historically been more volatile than BTC. That's unlikely to change with the U.S. election.  According to onchain options listed on decentralized exchange Derive, there is a 68% chance of ETH chalking out a 9.35% to 10.19% price swing, with BTC expected to see volatility ranging between 8.97% to 9.85%. A 10% volatility in ETH means a $247 move at the going market rate of $2,470, and a 10% move in BTC implies a $6,800 swing.  DEX traders are anticipating bullish volatility as well. As of Sunday, the total call option open interest stood at 1,179 contracts versus 885 open put option contracts, a sign of bullish inclination.  ""As the election nears, these figures are crucial for traders looking to navigate the heightened uncertainty in the crypto markets. It's a pivotal moment for onchain options trading, demonstrating the sophisticated strategies traders are employing to hedge against or capitalize on expected volatility,"" Nick Forster, founder of Derive, told CoinDesk.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/11/04/bitcoin-set-for-6k-8k-seesaw-as-us-elections-enters-final-stretch-analyst,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/90b5dc81d0aa1cfdd548fc839743b4cbed4d008e-3749x2109.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Polymarket still gives a significant premium to Trump's odds of winning compared to polls.  Perceived winning odds of Democrat Kamala Harris continue to rise on betting platform Polymarket ahead of the U.S. elections, with users buying and selling hundreds of thousands of favored shares in a bump for market activity.  Polymarket is a blockchain-based betting marketplace where users can buy ""shares"" in the outcome of any prediction, winning USDC 1 per share if the outcome occurs. If a Yes share for an event costs $0.60, the market interprets this as a 60% chance of the event occurring.  Shares of Harris winning the election have surged to over 44 cents ahead of Tuesday's count, up from 33 cents on October 30. Republican Donald Trump's shares have fallen in tandem, dropping from 66 cents to 55 cents in that time period.  Meanwhile, polling aggregator Real Clear Polling gives Trump a microscopic edge at 48.5-48.4%.  Bets above $10,000 and $100,000 have increased over the weekend to above-average activity. Large holders of Trump and Harris' ""yes"" shares are offloading their shares amid the high demand, likely taking profits from the price rise in those shares over the past few months.  The increase in Harris' odds might be due to traders hedging their bets, per a CoinDesk analysis, with a study of trades above $10,000 suggesting both large bets on Harris and strategic trading to protect against a Trump loss.  Some market observers said the increase in Harris' odds reflects hedging positions among traders who've also bet on a victory for her Republican rival Trump.  Well-known political bettor known as Domer said in an X post Sunday that they give Harris a 55-60% chance of becoming the next President, factoring in various polls and voter behavior trends.",NEUTRAL,USDC,MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | USDC,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/11/04/harris-and-trump-bets-near-even-odds-ahead-of-us-election-day-as-voter-fraud-rumors-swirl,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d331162c467dbde88390584c844234fab22bd943-1024x576.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

ETH is struggling and might recover if it clears the $2,500 resistance zone. Ethereum started a fresh decline from the $2,650 resistance zone. The price is trading below $2,500 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $2,450 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a recovery wave if it surpasses the $2,500 and $2,550 resistance levels. Ethereum Price Takes Hit Ethereum price struggled to stay above $2,550 and started a fresh decline like Bitcoin. ETH declined below the $2,520 and $2,500 levels. It tested the $2,420 support zone. A low was formed at $2,411 and the price is now attempting to recover. There was a move above the $2,450 resistance zone.

Besides, there was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $2,450 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading below $2,500 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,500 level and the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,582 swing high to the $2,411 low. The first major resistance is near the $2,520 level. The main resistance is now forming near $2,550. A clear move above the $2,550 resistance might send the price toward the $2,600 resistance. An upside break above the $2,600 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,650 resistance zone. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,500 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,450 level. The first major support sits near the $2,400 zone. A clear move below the $2,400 support might push the price toward $2,350. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,320 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,250.

It is interesting to note that the volume has not followed the rise in bitcoin in this second half of the year, unlike what happened in March. When we analyze Bitcoin's seasonality, we see that this could be a great investment opportunity. Investment Thesis I recommend buying the Franklin Bitcoin ETF (EZBC). The US elections are approaching with Trump favored in most swing states, including the ""Trump Trade"", which is apparently being reflected in the DXY, and so a confluence may be forming around Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). Trump has repeatedly demonstrated promising plans for cryptocurrencies. Although bitcoin is close to its highs, its volume is still low, and seasonality indicates that there is room for greater capital flows into the cryptocurrency, which could be a great investment opportunity. Franklin Bitcoin ETF The Franklin Bitcoin ETF seeks to replicate the performance of bitcoin, making it a big draw for investors looking for traditional exposure to the cryptocurrency's price. Let's take a look at the holdings. Holdings (Franklin Templeton) With this ETF, investors do not need to open accounts on exchanges and manage digital assets, making the investment process more convenient. The management fee is 0.19%. After this introduction, let's move on to the thesis. Why Invest In ETF And Not Directly In Bitcoin? Investing in bitcoin through the EZBC ETF brings a number of advantages. The ETF has a very competitive management fee of 0.19%, and other peers such as the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust (BATS: FBTC ) or the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (NYSEARCA: GBTC ) have management fees of 0.25% and 1.5% respectively. Other advantages include simplicity, as it eliminates the need to manage a portfolio of digital assets on an exchange. Finally, the ETF is registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and is offered by Franklin Templeton, which gives it an additional layer of security. The Elections and Their Implications For Bitcoin It is noticeable that the future of Bitcoin looks much more promising with the possible election of Donald Trump, at least if we analyze his latest statements . In this sense, Trump seems to be the favorite to win the election, given the latest polls in the swing states. Trump Pulls Ahead in Battleground States (Statista) Another indicator of market tension, and one that possibly indicates an advantage, is the DXY. As we can see below, the dollar versus a basket of currencies is appreciating in what the market has called the ""Trump Trade"". Fed Fund Rate 2024e (%) vs DXY (pts.) (BTG Pactual) Interesting Signs When analyzing this data regarding the elections, I was quite intrigued, and I went looking for more data to delve deeper into the analysis. What really caught my attention was that Bitcoin is at its all-time highs, but the volume is still very low. Price x Volume (The Block) Therefore, we have two options in my view: The volume is low, and the price will fall, or Bitcoin will come back into fashion, and with the volume returning, the cryptocurrency will skyrocket even more. It seems to me that the price will rise further due to another piece of data that I will show below. Seasonality In Bitcoin? The black line below shows the seasonality of Bitcoin prices based on average returns between 2012 and 2023. The red line shows Bitcoin's performance in 2024, and compares it to the historical average. Let's take a look below. Bitcoin Price Seasonality (Topdown Charts, LSEG) As we can see, Bitcoin has been showing strong seasonal performance in November and December. Furthermore, the current pattern suggests that it should continue to rise if this trend continues. This supports my recommendation to buy the Franklin Bitcoin ETF. Potential Threats To The Bullish Thesis One of the risks to my thesis is that, when looking for an ETF, the investor is usually looking for diversification. This is not the case with the Franklin Bitcoin ETF, so investors should be extra careful in their analysis. As for Trump's election being a trigger for the rise of Bitcoin, it is important to remember that election results are unpredictable, and there are also polls indicating a victory for Kamala Harris. Bitcoin is at its all-time highs, which means that much of the safety margin for investment is already gone. Additionally, the liquidity of this ETF may be a problem for large investors, given that the assets under management are around $522 million. Finally, the investor will not be buying Bitcoin directly, which means the net return will be slightly lower than what Bitcoin itself could provide. Finally, the investor would not be able to use it in financial transactions. The Bottom Line If Trump wins the US election, a series of combinations could occur that would make the price of Bitcoin rise even further, especially with the latest statements by the US presidential candidate. It is very striking that the Bitcoin volumes that followed the highs of March are not following the highs of October. However, when we analyze seasonality, we see that this could be an opportunity. Based on this analysis, I recommend buying the Franklin Bitcoin ETF. In my view, although the asset is at all-time highs, there is an opportunity for its prices to rise even further with the combination of factors reported.",POSITIVE,BTC | BTG,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | BTG,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4732614-ezbc-etf-confluence-may-be-forming-around-bitcoin?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/35629461.jpeg

While the airdrop was marred by a few issues, including a three-hour outage, the token’s price rally succeeded. Last October 29th, the token peaked at October 29th, then made a massive rally from October 31st until November 2nd, breaching the $1.50 level. After hitting a high of $1.9175 on November 2nd, it has slowed down, settled below the $1.75 level, and now trades at the $1.45 level. GRASS has rejected the $2 price, with analysts seeing a deeper pullback—so, is this the right time to buy? A Rough Start For GRASS Trading for GRASS started on October 28th, but a few issues delayed the token’s airdrop and launch. The team recorded technical issues, including users being prevented from accessing their tokens on their Phantom wallets. Also, the rush to claim the tokens was marred by the three-hour power interruption. Furthermore, some users reported flagged transactions, and many were disqualified from the airdrop. WTF is this @getgrass_io @grassfdn I’m using it since Epoch 1 and after 10 months of using, it is saying that your wallet is not eligible?? Really?#grassairdrop #grassfoundation #grassSCAM pic.twitter.com/wt7BWPBI1R — Phantom Soul (@PhantomSoulll) October 28, 2024 A total of 1 billion GRASS tokens were circulated, and 10% were given to early supporters and contributors. It’s still too early to see the full extent of these issues’ effect on GRASS, but the token started well price-wise. Token Tries To Breach $2 It’s challenging to make sense of GRASS’s price action since it only launched a few days ago. However, analysts see a bullish trend on the chart’s lower timeframes. The token boasts above-average volume in the last 24 hours. Also, the token’s on-balance volume and price increased starting October 30th. In short, there was buying pressure for the token, suggesting that price gains may happen soon. However, GRASS rejected $2, making it the token’s short-term psychological resistance. Analysts said the price could dip to $1.75 since the RSI reflects a bearish divergence. Related Reading: Will Bitcoin Hit $176K? Anthony Scaramucci Lays Out His High-Stakes Forecast Other Analysts See A Deeper Dive For GRASS Based on the technical charts, the analysts found two notable liquidity pools at prices of $1.56 and $1.96. The current price is currently closer to the liquidity pool at $1.56, with the token appearing to reject the $1.96 level. Since there’s a bearish momentum and a liquidity pool at $1.56, traders and holders can expect a price dip below $1,75. Swing traders and new buyers who want to enter a position can wait for the token’s retesting of $1.56 or even $1.4.
