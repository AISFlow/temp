42402376,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd4D2W,1546029045,The True Crypto Alternative to Government Money,"Evan Kuo is the co-founder of Ampleforth (formerly Fragments), a startup developing advanced technological solutions for the stablecoin market, and the former founder of on-demand delivery startup Pythagoras Pizza.    The following is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk’s 2018 Year in Review.  “I don’t believe we shall ever have a good money again before we take the thing out of the hands of government. That is, we can’t take them violently out of the hands of government. All we can do is by some sly roundabout way introduce something that they can’t stop.” - Friedrich Hayek  In 1976, the Nobel Laureate Friedrich Hayek authored an important and prescient paper titled: “The Denationalization of Money.” Bitcoin proponents love and often quote this work as the rationale for why Bitcoin needs to exist, but Hayek’s original vision looks less like today’s Bitcoin, and more like today’s stablecoins.  Hayek painted the picture of a world where money, like banking, is denationalized. He believed that unlike law and language, money had not been allowed to evolve due to sovereign influences suppressing competition. And he predicted that if governments were to allow for it, currencies would naturally evolve to compete on increased stability, eventually eliminating the devaluing effects of inflation altogether.  A bold claim, paired with a simple two-pronged approach:  Open the free trade of money  Allow the issuance of independent money.  At the time of publication, it would have been nearly impossible to imagine either of these taking place. Still, Hayek wrote with the hope that some perfect storm of circumstances might someday change the game, even going so far as to suggest that the change may need to happen without government support.  Today, more than 40 years after the idea’s inception, we see the denationalization of money unfolding organically in the form of digital assets.  A Sly Roundabout Way  The Bitcoin protocol can certainly be described as a ""sly roundabout way"" of introducing an independent money that no central authority can stop. In a stroke of genius, Bitcoin’s creators traded technical scalability for social scalability. And in this sense, Bitcoin’s approach toward decentralized money was precisely the workaround that Hayek asked for.  However, this is where the analogy connecting Bitcoin with Hayek’s fictional currency the ducat, diverges.  Hayek explicitly opposed the notion of a fixed supply currency. Possessing full knowledge of the economic history behind scarce metals and fresh off the collapse of Bretton Woods, he knew with certainty that fixed supply was not the solution he sought.  Like scarce metals, fixed supply assets cannot respond to changes in demand, and will never achieve the sustainable level of near-term price stability needed to compete with central bank money.  Fortunately, with Bitcoin’s ideals amplified by extreme speculative interest, the protocol succeeded in drawing a critical mass of attention to the inefficiencies of existing monetary and banking systems. And more importantly, Bitcoin instilled in a new generation of innovators the idea that money is something we can change.  The vast majority of stablecoins we see today are fiat collateralized. Back in 2015, unbanked cryptocurrency exchanges needed a fiat pegged token so that traders could move in and out of speculative positions on floating price assets like Bitcoin. Many of these exchanges existed outside the U.S. and lacked direct banking relationships.  Tether rose to fill this pressing need, collateralizing 1 U.S. dollar for every USDT token minted and forming partnerships with all major exchanges. This meant that whether you were a U.S. citizen or not, you could buy and sell a tokenized representation of the US dollar without restriction. Effectively, Tether opened up the free trade of sovereign money, unlocking the first phase of Hayek’s vision – what he referred to as the “practical” approach to denationalization.  Since then, much has been written about Tether’s controversy and it suffices to say that its near monopoly, lack of transparency, and reliance on centralized banking partners predisposed it to allegations of abuse.  Hayek believed that opening the free trade of money would lift the floor of monetary quality by placing pressure on weak currencies to execute monetary policy at the level of their best sovereign peers. For example, if citizens of Venezuela or Argentina could simply buy in and out of U.S. dollars, there would be no excuse for extended abuses of monetary policy.  And it’s fitting that in an environment of open competition, the digital asset market’s natural tendency was to diversify away from Tether through competition. Recently, a number of fiat collateralized alternatives have entered the stage including Paxos Standard Token (PAX), Gemini Dollar (GUSD), TrueUsd (TUSD) and Circle's CENTRE consortium (USD-C).  These new entrants are rapidly gaining traction, pressuring older players to improve their accounting practices and provide redeemability, or face extinction. Hayek could not have asked for a better demonstration of the benefits of open competition.  However, because these tokens are centralized their use is highly permissioned. At any point a banking partner can be restricted, forcing tokens to evade authority or cease operation. Moreover, the continued adoption of fiat collateralized stablecoins simply advances the dominance of existing sovereign currencies.  Algorithmic Stablecoins Issue Independent Money  Hayek also believed that the introduction of independent money would raise the ceiling of monetary quality by placing pressure on the best sovereign currencies to be more responsible with their issuance and regulation of supply. He called this second phase the “generalized” approach to denationalization.  Considerably fewer stablecoins can be called independent monies. Nevertheless, this is where we place the greatest hope for the future of digital assets; and correspondingly, this is where the most venture capital has been committed. MakerDao, Reserve, Ampleforth, and until recently, Basis, are examples of stablecoin projects that fall into this category.  Like Bitcoin, algorithmic stablecoins are designed to be market driven, resistant to regulation, and have strictly enforced supply policies that cannot be compelled by central authorities to change. With one major difference. Unlike Bitcoin they will be functional units of account, allowing them to compete with sovereign currencies on stability.  Lacking military and government mandates, independent monies can only exist if they are better at issuing and regulating supply than existing alternatives. If an independent cryptocurrency was fairer or more stable than existing currencies, knowledge of this would pressure even the best central banks to execute better monetary policy.  Today, some 60 percent of foreign reserves are already held in U.S. dollars or Treasury bonds; and many people including the IMF consider it a social responsibility to avoid creating a world that is excessively reliant on the US dollar for global economic affairs.  Moreover, the interconnectedness of today’s global economy along with the United States’ obligation to engage in cycles of continuous deficit spending (eg: The Triffin Dilemma) contributes to increasingly large boom and bust cycles that quickly translate domestic economic crises into global economic crises.  It is the dissatisfaction with these cycles, the realization that such cycles can grind the banking system of even the world’s most powerful economy to a halt, that spurred the cryptocurrency movement during the last global financial crisis. As a community, we shouldn’t lose sight of this vision.  Looking Ahead to 2019  It will be a long time before algorithmic stablecoins are used on exchanges the way fiat collateralized coins are used today. Algorithmic stablecoins have the potential to profoundly transform money as we know it, but they are much harder to pull off and introduce risks that can only diminish with time and scale.  For this reason, expect that in the near-term fiat collateralized stablecoins will continue to dominate the base trading pair use case on exchanges, and their success will be driven by enterprise relationships with regulators and exchanges, rather than community or ideology.  To gain adoption, digitally native stablecoins will need incentives beyond base trading pair utility to compensate for their increased risks. These incentives could be greater stability, a better philosophical underpinning, or game-theoretic incentives aligned with network growth.  Ultimately, only algorithmic stablecoins can further the underlying mission of digital currencies and emerge as true alternatives to government money. Hayek would have asked for not one, but many concurrent denationalized currencies to prove their worth.  Have an opinionated take on 2018? CoinDesk is seeking submissions for our 2018 in Review.

42402382,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd4DAO,1546020055,Security Researchers Break Ledger Wallets With Simple Antennae,"Radio antennae are the original networking technology, and researchers presenting in Berlin Thursday showed how useful they are as hacking tools.  The hardware researchers set out to find different kinds of vulnerabilities in the most popular hardware wallets used by cryptocurrency holders, from Trezor and Leger. At the Chaos Computer Club Conference in Germany, Dmitry Nedospasov said that he and his collaborators set out to find three different kinds of vulnerabilities and said they succeeded in finding all three.  They presented vulnerabilities the supply chain (where the attacker gets access to the device before the consumer owns it), side channel attacks (where observations are made on the hardware itself rather than the code running the hardware) and glitch attacks (where attackers attempt to disrupt data transmission within a device).  https://youtu.be/Y1OBIGslgGM  The three collaborators were located in Russia, Germany and the U.S., so they conducted their investigations primarily over Telegram group chat. It took them 50,000 messages and 1,100 images to get all three attacks done.  ""It's a really long time we spent looking at this,"" Nedospasov said during their introduction.  Simple antennae played a critical role in the two most dramatic attacks, but, for its part, Ledger does not find these demonstrations alarming.  ""Anyone following these attacks needs to understand that both scenarios as portrayed are not practical in the real world and extremely unlikely,"" Nicolas Bacca, CTO at Ledger, told CoinDesk via a spokesperson. ""We stand by our products and are continually updating and implementing firmware countermeasures to ensure the highest standards of wallet integrity against hackers.""  The company published a detailed blog post critiquing each of the attacks presented.  Supply Chain  How easy is it really to get access to a wallet before it reaches a final user?  Not that hard, it turns out, according to Josh Datko, owner of security consultancy Cryptotronix. He said:  ""Supply chain attacks are easy to perform, but they are hard to perform at scale.""  Datko explained that makers of secure hardware primarily use stickers to ensure that no one has opened a box since it left a factory, but Datko found that it's very simple to open a sticker without breaking it or leaving residue using a blow dryer or hot air gun.  So all an attacker would need to do is get some wallets, tamper with them and then get them to a retailer. For example, someone might buy them at a store, tamper with them and then put them back on the shelves.  As an example, the Ledger Nano S uses an on device function to protect users against verifying bad transactions. If users assume their computer is compromised (as most hardware wallets do), the Ledger still requires the user to verify a transaction by pushing buttons on the Nano itself.  That way, if a bad transaction shows up (for example, sending all your BTC to an unknown wallet), the user can just reject it.  However, Datko found it was possible to pop open a Ledger and install an internal receiver that enabled tampering with this function. In fact, using an antennae, he could ""press"" the button for yes. This would allow him to authenticate a transaction made by a compromised computer without physically touching the Ledger (though it would only work if the Ledger were attached to a computer, and presumably most of the time it is not).  Obviously, this would require getting someone to buy a bad Ledger, knowing where they lived, hacking their computer and then watching them in some way to know when the Ledger is attached to the computer.  Datko was able to send the signal from over 30 feet away, and believes with more powerful antennae he could do it from much further away.  Side channel  Thomas Roth demonstrated two side channel attacks, but the one against the Ledger Blue used an antennae to read the PIN of device user.  Roth explained that they started by analysing the hardware architecture of the Blue. They noticed that there was a fairly long connection between the secure element and another processor. In other words, the wire that connected these two components was physically quite long, due to their physical distance apart on the circuit board (each on other side of the device's relatively large battery).  Roth said:  ""What is a long conductor with a fast changing current? It's an antennae.""  So they looked to see if they could discern any kind of signal change when the device was interacted with. They found a significant signal when the touch screen was used to enter in digits for the PIN.  So they built a small robotic device to press a button over and over while their antennae listened and logged data. This was used to build up training data for an artificial intelligence system to analyze.  They were able to get a very high likelihood of identifying each digit on a PIN on the tested device.  So this would theoretically enable them to get close to a user and ""listen"" with an antennae to discern their code. That said, they would still then need to get their hands on the physical wallet to do anything with it, and this assumes that the user hadn't taken additional measures.  That said, Ledger pointed out that this attack is less dramatic than it seems in their post, noting that it requires extremely controlled conditions to execute. ""A better side channel would be to put a camera in the room and record the user entering his/her PIN,"" the post noted.  Nevertheless, Nedospasov was surprised by how well the team did in its search for vulnerabilities. He said:  ""When we set out six months ago we did not plan to have 100 percent success.""  More information about these attacks and others will be shared in an open source fashion on Github and on their new site, Wallet.Fail.

As can be seen, the price bounced on a confluence of support including the likes of the daily Bollinger band basis line, 61.8% Fibonacci retracement, as well as the prior support and resistance area near $3,500 (green zone).  In order for bulls to now extend the rally towards $5,000, bitcoin's price must scale the neckline of the widely observed inverse head and shoulders pattern - an indicator of bullish reversal.  The pattern can be described as three successive troughs, the middle or ""head"" of which is the deepest.  If bitcoin can find acceptance above the neckline, the reversal pattern should take effect, potentially sending the price towards $5,200 which is measured by adding the depth of inverse head and shoulders ""head"" to the anticipated breakout point.  Hourly chart  The hourly chart further depicts the most recent bullish development. We can see that a bear flag (a bearish continuation pattern) had formed inside of a falling wedge, a bullish reversal pattern.  It's safe to say bitcoin's latest boost has invalidated the bear flag and price now has different resistances in its immediate path in the form of moving averages (MA's).  As can be seen, price was able to close the last hour above the 100 hour MA - an encouraging sign for the short term bulls, but the stronger 200 hour MA has yet to be conquered.  The relative strength index on the hourly chart is now considerably overbought, so consolidation or a minor pullback in the near term may be the most likely course of action.  View  The daily chart depicts an inverse head and shoulders pattern that could yield a rally to $5,000 and perhaps beyond if its neckline is successfully scaled.  The hourly bear flag has been invalidated, further easing the bearish concerns for now.  Acceptance below the most recent higher low of $3,567 will invalidate the bullish reversal set up and likely bring the most recent lows of $3,130 into play - prices as per Coinbase.

42402373,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd4CzZ,1546003826,2019: The Year Digital Securities Offerings Become the New ICOs,"Carlos Domingo is the founder and CEO of Securitize, an end-to-end platform for issuers seeking to tokenize assets. He is also the founder and crypto capitalist of SPiCE VC.  The following is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk’s 2018 Year in Review.  2018 was a tumultuous year for cryptocurrencies, but for those of us who work in digital securities, also known as security tokens, our enthusiasm for the blockchain and distributed ledger technology (DLT) has never been stronger.  Digital securities are not theoretical concepts anymore, but rather a foundation for real applications on the blockchain. A nascent industry poised to fundamentally evolve global capital markets, it’s just now getting started.  The digital evolution of legacy securities  It is amazing to think that just a few decades ago, the New York Stock Exchange would shut down every Wednesday just to process trades and settlements via couriers on bikes physically carrying stock certificates between buildings on Wall Street every time a stock changed hands.  This lead to the “Paperwork crisis of the 1960s” in 1968 when the volume of stocks traded rose threefold to 15 million shares per day. Following the crisis was the creation of the Depository Trust Company in 1973 and the National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC) in 1976, which later merged in 1999 to create the Depository Trust and Clearing Company (DTCC).  This signified that the digital era had come to Wall Street.  Today, DTCC holds trillions of dollars in shares and settles more than $1 quadrillion in trade value. However, the sector failed to truly digitize the end-to-end process. Pre-trade order routing and electronic trading of securities had become extremely low cost and frictionless, but the same improvements have not arrived similarly to clearing, settlement and custody.  Blockchain-based digital securities have emerged to solve these problems and enable low risk management, proxy votes, liquidity and seamless dividend distributions among other features. First, they allow for individual ownership of the digital shares through tokens. Second, they enable instant settlements so there is no counterparty risk, eliminating billions of dollars in intermediary fees. You trade you own, not like today.  They also help to enhance transparency measures by providing visibility for an almost real-time cap table for the issuer. And finally, digital securities can simplify governance processes through voting or payout distribution, which could also be done using smart contracts and stablecoins to improve efficiencies and reduce the processing fees.  Paving the way for digital securities  Blockchain technology has pulled the rug out from under legacy financial systems.  For all the trouble ICOs may have inflicted and still might on investors, issuers and regulators, one fact remains – they proved that blockchains, coins and tokens were a phenomenal system for successful fundraising.  Anyone with patience and a computer could list their idea for investment and any inclined investor could buy an interest in a company or community and then trade that interest with an instant settlement for fiat currency or another coin on the blockchain. Suddenly there was a way for investors to invest in private companies and startups and to have instant liquidity in global markets. And the market responded with resounding attention.  Blockchain technology is so good at raising money that the crypto markets lost their minds. One study – which examined over 4000 ICOs – found that within four months of issuing a token, more than half of the projects launched had already failed.  ICOs may have tainted the narrative around cryptocurrencies, but digital securities are helping to shift the conversation to show the wider public that blockchain technology can help to power compliance, too.  BUIDL-ing the foundations  In mid-2017, we saw the blockchain technology’s potential to digitize securities. The technology could be used to automate and provide transparency to the process of purchasing, owning and transferring a security between investors.  By end of 2017, three funds, had successfully raised funds and issue tokens representing digital securities on the Ethereum blockchain, first Blockchain Capital, then Science Blockchain, then Protos. They represented early attempts at creating digital securities that followed rules and regulations associated with securities.  Following in their footsteps, I had begun to work on SPiCE VC, a blockchain technology venture capital firm, in March 2017, which would eventually become the fourth digital security ever issued. At that time, the market was still heavily focused on ICOs and there was no platform that could provide the level of compliance to security tokens that we wanted for the issuance and lifecycle management of SPiCE VC, so we built one and launched it in September 2017.  By that time, the SEC had issued the DAO report saying that the infamous leaderless ICO, which raised $50 million in crowdfunding, was actually a security offering.  Secondly, many prominent people in the industry started discussing how tokenizing securities on the blockchain was a way to improve private securities and was a big deal beyond just making ICOs legal since it is a much larger market. For context, there were $1.7 trillion private placements in capital raising in the U.S. alone in 2017 as opposed to a few billion dollars in ICOs worldwide according to a 2018 SEC report.  We saw the opportunity to provide a compliant security issuance platform for others and spun it off as a new company called Securitize, which we launched in January 2018.  Along with other key players in the space like Polymath and Templum, we knew that eventually regulators would catch up with ICOs. The digital security offering (DSO) is already taking over as the preferred, complaint way to raise capital and issue debt on the blockchain and not only for blockchain companies but for other type of operating business or even real estate or art.  Transforming the securities landscape  2019 needs to be the year of increased liquidity of digital securities. This can be done via the emergence of regulated trading platforms for tokenized securities like Open Finance, which just launched this year.  Right now, there are several companies looking to tokenize assets but few individuals wanting to invest in the tokens themselves. As other regulators begin outlining the rules and guidelines around how transactions should take place, investor confidence will grow.  Public perception on digital securities is evolving too as the ecosystem is maturing. The drop in the cryptocurrency market has helped to consolidate the industry and cut out the unnecessary projects in the space. Mainstream financial media publications are covering the digital securities industry more frequently too, which is a great indication that the masses are beginning to recognize the benefits of cryptocurrency.  Digital security industry community building efforts are emerging with more to come in 2019. The first dedicated conferences and associations, like the Security Token Academy, are starting to gain momentum helping to stimulate meaningful dialogue in the industry.  The key action point for 2019, for the industry, is to start communicating the advantages of digital securities to traditional financial markets and investors to encourage them to enter the market. Once this starts to happen, we are optimistic that we will see a wave of DSO adoption.  Have an opinionated take on 2018? CoinDesk is seeking submissions for our 2018 in Review.

42402366,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd4Crh,1545999003,Craig Wright Denied Attempt to Dismiss Lawsuit Over Billions in Bitcoin,"A U.S. federal court has largely denied crypto entrepreneur and self-proclaimed bitcoin inventor Craig Wright’s attempt to dismiss a lawsuit alleging that he misappropriated billions of dollars'-worth of bitcoin from the estate of a former business partner.  Wright is being sued by Ira Kleiman on behalf of the estate of his brother, the late Dave Kleiman, a forensic computer investigator and author, who passed away in 2013 following a battle with MRSA.  The suit accuses Wright of scheming to “seize Dave’s bitcoins and his rights to certain intellectual property associated with the bitcoin technology,” and is seeking return of a good portion of the 1.1 million bitcoins (worth roughly $3.9 billion as of press time) mined by the two, or its “fair market value,” as well as compensation for IP infringement.  Wright, the controversial cryptographer who has claimed to be bitcoin’s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, filed a motion in April of this year to dismiss the case.  However, a court document filed in the southern district of Florida on Thursday reveals that most counts of Wright’s motion have been denied.  Of particular note, the order states:  ""Here, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged a claim for conversion. The Amended Complaint alleges that Defendant converted at least 300,000 bitcoins upon Dave’s death and transferred them to various international trusts, which was an unauthorized act that deprived the Plaintiffs of the bitcoins therein. Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ claim for conversion (Count I) survives Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss. ""  Elsewhere in the document, the court states that the exact number of bitcoin involved is yet to be determined, but the estate contends that it is ""entitled to at least 300,000 bitcoins, along with their forked assets.""  The estate's claim for constructive fraud also survives the motion to dismiss, it adds.  Wright's motion did, however, succeed on the claim that counts III and IV over misappropriation of ""trade secrets"" were not valid, as the three-year statute of limitations in Florida had been exceeded.  The order indicates that the plaintiffs stated that they were aware of Wright’s conduct on April 22, 2014, adding: ""Even if they did not know the extent of the harm, upon learning of the Defendant’s conduct from the ATO auditor, the Plaintiffs should have discovered the Defendant’s misapplication of the trade secrets through the 'exercise of reasonable diligence.'""  Wright must now respond to counts I, II and V-IX, no later than Jan. 10, 2019.

42402374,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd4D0Y,1545994922,Electrum Wallet Attack May Have Stolen As Much as 245 Bitcoin,"A phishing attack on the Electrum wallet network has possibly managed to steal around 245 bitcoins, worth over $880,000 at today's prices.  Warning of the attack on Thursday, the firm tweeted: “There is an ongoing phishing attack against Electrum users. Our official website is https://electrum.org Do not download Electrum from any other source.”  The bad actor set up the attack by creating multiple fake servers on the Electrum wallet network. As a result, when wallet users that connected to those servers attempted to broadcast a bitcoin transaction, they received an error message providing a malicious link to malware disguised as an updated wallet, the firm explained on its Github page.  Electrum said that ""To make the attack more effective, the attacker is creating lots of servers (sybils), hence increasing the chance a client would connect to him.""  A Reddit user posted a bitcoin address Thursday that they said the attacker is using to consolidate the stolen cryptocurrency from several addresses used in the attacks. If true, 245 BTC have been taken in this attack, an amount worth $884,000 at press time.  Electrum has moved to mitigate the problem and has released a new version of its wallet 3.3.2, it said on the Github page, adding that “This is not a true fix, but the more proper fix of using error codes would entail upgrading the whole federated server ecosystem out there.”  The firm explained:  “We did not publicly disclose this until now, as around the time of the 3.3.2 release, the attacker stopped; however they now started the attack again.”  Instances of cryptocurrency hacks are fast on the rise as criminals seek an easy path to rich rewards.  According to a recent report from blockchain security firm CipherTrace, nearly $1 billion in cryptos have been stolen so far this year. Another report from McAfee showed that there were nearly four million new mining malware threats in the third quarter of 2018 alone, compared to less than 500,000 in 2017 and 2016.

The bank announced Thursday that it has launched a new remittance service, dubbed NBK Direct Remit, that enables “immediate” blockchain-based payments using Ripple technology.  The service is launching with a remittance corridor to Jordan only, but is expected expand to more countries in the near future, the bank said in a statement. NBK has a presence in China, Geneva, London, Paris, New York and Singapore, and regionally in Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Turkey and UAE.  NBK is charging a fee of 1 Kuwaiti dinars ($3.29) per transaction for Jordan transfers if funds are sent to its local branch. For customers using other banks, it will levy 5 KWD ($16.47) per transaction. The default limit for transactions is capped at 2,000 KWD ($6,586).  Marcus Treacher, SVP of customer success at Ripple, said his firm has started moving live payments across its blockchain network on behalf of NBK customers.  NBK joins the growing number of financial institutions worldwide to have partnered with Ripple for its blockchain-based payments services. Most recently, these include Malaysian banking group CIMB, South Korea’s crypto exchange Coinone, U.S. banking giant PNC, remittance firm UAE Exchange, among others.

42402375,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd4D1X,1545973205,"It's the Crypto Network, Stupid","Ian Simpson is chairman of communications at the Crypto Valley Association, an organization that supports the Swiss blockchain sector.  The following is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk’s 2018 Year in Review.  “Grin and bear it,” they say.  And in the current crypto market conditions, many people, on all sides, are “bearing” it, most without any grin on their face whatsoever. But those who are showing any faint signs of satisfaction – leaving aside the Nouriel Roubinis of the world – are the ones who have learned a simple lesson: We are better together.  If there is one major flaw that crops up time and again when people suddenly become endowed with exorbitant amounts of money, it is the conviction that no one else is needed. After all, money solves everything; it is, as Fyodor Dostoyevsky famously claimed, “coined freedom.”  This was the promise of ICO funding: non-dilutive capital, no activist investors, no long list of required paperwork. Crypto supposedly allowed every talented group of visionaries to pursue their own version, at their own pace and within the confines of their own team.  As we all now know, it turned out to be much more complicated than that.  A Betrayal of Faith  And let’s be honest – this independence hasn’t been good.  Not only was it not good because teams weren’t held accountable for shipping code and acquiring a healthy base of users and customers in order to sustain a business, it wasn’t good because the vast majority of projects set out for the moon, charting their own path without ever considering how they would eventually fit into a wider, more interconnected blockchain ecosystem.  And this is a clear betrayal of the blockchain ethos. Remember – it’s the network, stupid.  The same network effects that ballooned the Telegram communities of some of 2017s big-name successes also created a false sense of security and confidence and subconsciously inspired a return to centralized thinking: We are number one.  To be fair, this is the kind of thinking that most often fuels successful businesses – you know, market dominance and all that. Further, you would be hard-pressed to find a more collaborative developer community than Ethereum and a more decentralized company than ConsenSys, and both have had their troubles.  Unfortunately, using the same protocol or programming language doesn’t always lead to successful collaboration and success. But in the end, it isn’t all about the underlying programming language or protocol.  A wide range of wise voices has rightly pointed out that instead of HODLing with every last nerve, people should be putting their heads down and BUIDLing, shipping products and code like there’s no tomorrow (because there might not be).  But actually, as much as BUIDLing real, usable products is imperative, there is a lot of relationship BUIDLing that needs to be done as well. And that includes BUIDLing products that acknowledge the fact that their success depends on these relationships – with other technologies, with other startups, and yes, even with industry incumbents.  It may sound like betrayal at first. Or an act of suicide. But it doesn’t have to be.  Established companies in an industry vertical are there for a reason. They have customers and resources. Most of all, they have built a (certain) level of trust with their customer base. Oh yes, and they have money.  Tapping into those resources and market position makes growth and scaling possible – even in bear market conditions.  New Networks, New Possibilities  “Better together” doesn’t only mean turning to the big corporations for money and industry know-how, however, which is why it shouldn’t be viewed as treason.  It also means cooperation between startups, mergers and a more urgent focus on interoperability, both at a technical level and an ecosystem level. While it might hurt the pride at first, the end result is almost certain to be good. On the one hand, more avenues to adoption lead to a bigger pie to divide. On the other, there will be a greater acceptance among traditional consumers.  Ultimately, this is what users expect: a seamless experience in everything they do.  The spirit of cooperation and decentralization have long been “central” to the success and prosperity of Switzerland, home of the Crypto Valley. But it would be remiss to claim that the country has a monopoly on the qualities.  The idea of “better together” extends, after all, to other jurisdictions as well. Over the last 12 months, projects coming to Crypto Valley, Switzerland have found great advantage in the close connection to nearby Lichtenstein. The Crypto Valley Association has hosted numerous high-level delegations from other countries, many in Asia, who are looking to learn and understand what makes for good public policy for blockchain and crypto technology. And it’s not hard to envision a day when regulations in multiple countries become aligned to the point of enabling truly decentralized businesses.  There are even projects, like Covee, in Crypto Valley using blockchain to tackle the very challenge of collaboration in the field of knowledge work. This closely mirrors the modus operandi of much of the innovation in Switzerland, including that of the joint project of national telco Swisscom and the Swiss Post, which are developing an infrastructure for blockchain applications.  Perhaps the most telling example comes from a brief moment during the public launch of SEBA Crypto, the Zug-based company aiming to become Switzerland’s first fully-licensed and fully-regulated crypto bank. Nikolaj Nikolajsen, founder of Bitcoin Suisse (arguably one of Switzerland’s crypto industry incumbents) stood up to declare that far from seeing SEBA as competition, he and the Bitcoin Suisse board felt that both could work to “grow the pie” and benefit each other.  It was enough put a smile on most people’s faces.  Have an opinionated take on 2018? CoinDesk is seeking submissions for our 2018 in Review.
