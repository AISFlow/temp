42398336,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTICt,1430862340,FinCEN Fines Ripple Labs for Bank Secrecy Act Violations,"UPDATE 6th May 1:30 UTC: Ripple Labs' official response to the FinCEN settlement has been added below.      The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has fined Ripple Labs and its subsidiary XRP II a combined $700,000 for ""willful violations"" of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA).  According to a 5th May press release by the US regulator, Ripple Labs failed to register as a money services business (MSB) with FinCEN prior to selling XRP, a digital token used to settle payments on the Ripple network. Additionally, the company is said to have failed to implement appropriate anti-money laundering (AML) procedures concurrent with its responsibilities as an MSB.  Similarly, its subsidiary, XRP II, is said to have acted unlawfully as an MSB without an effective AML program, failing to report “several” transactions said to be suspicious in nature.  The bulk of the violations against both companies appear to have taken place between 2013 and early 2014, according to a more detailed addendum to the release.  Notably, the agreement between Ripple Labs, its subsidiary and FinCEN has also taken place at the same time as a settlement between the companies and the US Attorney’s Office in the Northern District of California. The Internal Revenue Service's Criminal Investigation Division also contributed to the investigation.  Ripple and XRP II agreed to pay $450,000 and settle “possible criminal charges"" in connection with that investigation, with those funds being credited to the fine imposed by FinCEN.  FinCEN Director Jennifer Shasky Calvery said in a statement that the event should serve as a reminder to all US companies that facilitate the exchange of digital currencies:  “Innovation is laudable but only as long as it does not unreasonably expose our financial system to tech-smart criminals eager to abuse the latest and most complex products.”  Ripple Labs and XRP II have agreed to a number of conditions to settle with both FinCEN and the US Attorney’s Office, including “enhanced remedial measures” aimed at beefing up its monitoring programs.  The settlements dictate that “certain enhancements” to the Ripple Protocol need to take place “to appropriately monitor all future transactions”.  The company further agreed to biannual compliance audits through 2020.  Ripple responds  When reached for comment, a spokesperson for the company sought to frame the decision as one that showcased the tribulations that can come with building a company in an emerging field.  ""Ripple Labs was one of the first to proactively build out a compliance and risk program,"" Ripple Labs spokesperson Monica Long told CoinDesk. ""We’ve been consistent in our message of supporting a compliant and healthy Ripple ecosystem.""  Long went on to stress that Ripple Labs does not believe it ""willfully engaged"" in criminal activity, adding that the company has not been prosecuted for any of its actions.  Long added:  ""Ripple is infrastructure technology for banks to build compliant payment networks. The settlement announced today does not impede our ability to execute on those bank integrations.""  Government cooperation  Settlement documents provided by the Department of Justice (DOJ) go on to detail the considerations made during the settlement process with Ripple Labs and the factors that led it to drop its criminal charges.  Among the factors cited by the DOJ were what the agency called Ripple's ""extensive cooperation"" with the government, its commitment to enhancing internal controls and its promise that it would continue to cooperate on matters of future concern.  Further, the company agreed to certain measures for a three-year term, including that it would disclose ""any document, record or other tangible evidence"" relating to BSA violations; designate employees to provide the government requested materials; and ensure the government has access to current executives, and to the extent possible, former company directors.  Should Ripple Labs be found in violation of the agreement, it will be provided with 30 days to respond to the accusations levied by the DOJ before action is taken.  Subsidiary issues  The involvement of Ripple Labs subsidiary XRP II is largely due to its use as a mechanism for the company to sell XRP ""to various third parties on a wholesale basis"". The company undertook sales of XRP prior to registering as an MSB, which took place on 4th September, 2013.  The company also failed to develop and implement a written AML policy until 26th September of that year, while operating without a compliance officer until ""late January 2014"". According to FinCEN, XRP II had “inadequate internal controls” to ensure BSA compliance and did not conduct an AML risk assessment prior to March 2014.  The documents suggest Ripple Labs has been aware of a federal investigation into compliance violations during the period in which XRP II was noncompliant.  “XRP II did not conduct training on its AML program until nearly a year after beginning to engage in sales of virtual currency, by which time Ripple Labs was aware of a federal criminal investigation,” the document states, suggesting that the company failed to conduct an independent review of its AML program during the same period.  The FinCEN document outlined three transactions showing how XRP II failed to file suspicious activity reports (SARs) despite being required to do so.  The most notable transaction of the three took place on 30th September, when the company sold $250,000 in XRP by email to Ripple Labs investor Roger Ver without requiring a know-your-customer form to be filled out.  XRP II is said to have failed to file two additional reports for attempted XRP purchases that took place in November 2013 and January 2014. In both cases, XRP II did not actually conduct a transaction but also failed to file SARs.

42398333,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTIBu,1430846293,Review: GetGems iOS App Glitters But It's Still Seeking Gold,"Name of product: GetGems.  What it is: Mobile messaging app with built-in, bitcoin-based incentivization token.  Made by: GetGems.  Who’s behind it: Israeli developer Daniel Peled, with $400,000 in strategic investment from Magma VC and $780,000 raised in its initial crowdsale.  Cost: Free to download.  Date launched: 29th April 2015.  Basic summary:  GetGems is a decentralized social messaging app built on open-source software provided by popular encrypted messenger Telegram. The app allows users to send and receive both bitcoin (BTC) and its native digital token, GEMZ.  Billed as ""the first messaging app that pays you"", users earn GEMZ by helping to grow the network, with rewards of 25 GEMZ given for every referral that generates a new participant. Additionally, 27,500 GEMZ are distributed to users daily, with users receiving a part of this amount proportional to the number of users they have invited to the network.  As the app is updated, users will have more ways to earn, including viewing in-app ads.  A token created on top of the Counterparty protocol, GEMZ are currently traded on exchanges such as BTER and Poloniex at a press time value of $0.01 per GEMZ.  CoinDesk Rating: 3/5  The basics  After downloading the iOS app, GetGems launches with an animation that showcases one of the messaging service's biggest strengths – its visual appeal. Before users can explore, however, there is a somewhat lengthy sign-up process.  Users first provide their name and profile picture and choose whether to allow the app to send push notifications or access their contacts. Next, a wallet PIN number is set and confirmed, a feature that is used to safeguard consumers from sending unwanted transactions.  GetGems then asks users to name who invited them to the service, should this be applicable. As part of this referral program, the individual would receive a referral award in GEMZ.  Using the service  While GetGems is a redesign of the Telegram messenger in most respects, the novel features of the GetGems app are its built-in bitcoin and GEMZ wallets.  For example, by typing '1 GEMZ' or '0.01 BTC' in the messenger, users are able to quickly transfer value. After typing any value, the 'Send' button will change to a GetGems or bitcoin logo, which when tapped will execute the payment. This exchange does not work at present if users send added text as part of the message.  Users can toggle between BTC and GEMZ, displaying the value held in each of their GetGems wallets. Clicking on the paper airplane image in the top right allows users to send money by pasting a bitcoin or GetGetms wallet address or by displaying a QR code.  On trial, we sent 0.0002 BTC over the app to a Circle address, the amount of which was quickly detected by the bitcoin blockchain and the wallet provider.  Security  The GetGems app has a simple payments verification (SPV) client built in, meaning the wallet can access the bitcoin network through 'full' trusted nodes rather than connecting directly. According to the company, this removes the need for trusted servers while maintaining fast performance on mobile devices.  For privacy conscious users, it should be noted GetGems controls user private keys for in-app wallet addresses, crediting users for GEMZ that have been deposited. This makes transfers instant, but requires them to be completed off of the bitcoin blockchain. Password resets are also not allowed, as private keys are derived from the password.  The passphrase for accessing the wallet is encrypted locally on the device, meaning that funds can be spent only if both the phone and the PIN are compromised by bad actors. Further, after several failed attempts to guess the PIN, the server will lock the account and prevent decryption.  Going forward, GetGems is seeking to enable users to hold multiple GEMZ wallets on the app, a feature requested by larger crowdsale participants, and create a desktop application.  Pros  Intuitive messenger allows easy BTC and GEMZ exchange.  Notification options allow wide range of customizations.  Passphrase recovery feature guards against phone loss.  Straightforward wallet system for external BTC and GEMZ transfers.  Strong visual elements and appeal.  Cons  Infrequent glitches and crashes.  Inability to purchase GEMZ in app.  Telegram users receive messages sent on GetGems.  Conclusion  Armed with a vibrant pink display, GetGems evokes a playful tone that arguably helps encourage users to overcome some of the app's less intuitive features.  This sense of discovery propels past issues such as balances that were slow to update or sudden, unexpected crashes or glitches.  The best case for adding GetGems to your iPhone may be to consider the product as a functional social wallet, one that brings you together with other bitcoin users who may be using Blockchain, Coinbase or Circle in an easy and intuitive way, while rewarding you with a secondary set of tokens.  However, the biggest hurdle for GetGems to overcome will be establishing consumer behavior in the way that it envisions.  Should users fail to see any value in exchanging bitcoin while they message, it will be difficult for GetGems, or any competitor, to encourage your social circle to stick around.  Update 20:00 UTC, 5th May: GetGems has indicated that it has since responded to initial crash reports in the days after launch, updating the platform to resolve these errors.

42398323,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTI33,1430833404,Primedice Shifts Focus Following US and Australia Ban,"Bitcoin gambling site Primedice will shift its focus to Russia and China following its decision to block US and Australia-based customers.  The company, which announced Thursday it had stopped serving US and Australia-based customers due to regulatory uncertainty in both countries, is now seeking to grow its second and third largest client bases.  A spokesperson for Primedice said that the company was not expecting to come across legal issues in neither Russia nor China.  When asked about the implications of the restrictions, the spokesperson continued:  ""We've had to give up nearly 50% of our client base but with such an uncertain legal landscape surrounding bitcoin gambling [in the US] we feel this is better off in the long run.""  They added: ""Australia only accounted for a little under 5% of our client base so blocking it was an easy decision in terms of mitigating unnecessary risk.""  Primedice is not the first online gambling service to block US-based users.  In October last year, SatoshiBet announced it would restrict US customers from accessing its gambling platform, also citing the uncertain future of online gambling regulation in the US and legal problems that could result from servicing American customers.  Transactional volume  According to Primedice's spokesperson, the company has surpassed 5 billion individual bets since its inception in May 2013.  The site's activity accounts for a significant portion of daily bitcoin transactions too. Analyst Tim Swanson recently found that Primedice's activity from 1st January to 18th April roughly equalled BitPay's daily transactional volume in 2014.  According to an infographic released by BitPay, it processed a total $158.8m last year, resulting in a daily average of $435,068.  Disclaimer: CoinDesk founder Shakil Khan is an investor in BitPay.

42398331,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTI8x,1430820427,Huobi Will Now Take Your Bitcoins as Stock Trading Collateral,"Huobi has launched a service allowing users to mortgage their bitcoins in return for Chinese yuan (CNY) loans to purchase real shares on the Shanghai Stock Exchange.  The platform, Caimao, allows investors disappointed with the recent slump in bitcoin price to put that value to use in an asset class that has grown 125% in the past year.  Customers will use the Caimao platform to deposit their bitcoins and also buy and sell individual shares of their choice. They can borrow up to 60% of the BTC deposit value.  Funds for borrowing are supplied by a third-party provider.  The move takes some pressure off exchanges like Huobi, as Chinese investors cash in their coins to try their luck on the more bullish Shanghai Composite Index.  Loans are offered on a daily (0.1% interest per day) and monthly (1.2–1.7% interest per month) basis. Customers could theoretically take out loans for six months to a year if they expected returns to exceed the interest owed, though Huobi anticipates it will be more attractive to short-term traders.  At completion of the loan's term, the customer pays back the borrowed amount plus interest, and then withdraws the initial BTC deposit amount – plus profits or minus losses.  Risk management mechanism  Juggling the value of multiple investment options at once might seem risky, but Huobi said it has a risk management system in place that works similar to those of margin trading platforms on other bitcoin exchanges.  The Caimao platform calculates a ratio based on money balances and the changing prices of both BTC and the shares purchased. If a customer's ratio falls below a certain set figure the position is liquidated, with shares and/or BTC being sold to cover any losses.  A customer whose shares suffered a net loss at the same time as a drop in bitcoin's price would be more at risk of such a liquidation.  Huobi says it will hold the bitcoin amounts as collateral for the loan, selling it only if necessary to cover any losses.  Due to the deep liquidity of both Huobi's bitcoin exchange and the Shanghai Stock Exchange, plus the platform's execution speed, the company is ""confident"" any forced liquidations can be completed at the target price.  BTC as collateral  While Caimao is the first product aimed specifically at trading on the stockmarket, some Chinese exchanges, including Huobi, have deployed the BTC-as-collateral model for some time now.  Last year BTCTrade launched the Yuanbao loan service, which also allows customers to borrow up to 60% of their bitcoins' value for whatever purpose they wish. Yuanbao also let users set their own interest rates and term limits within recommended parameters.  Huobi's Dangpu.com service, which will continue operating, also works on similar principles.  Opening world markets to all  At this stage, the loans will be available to mainland Chinese citizens only, but Huobi's Robert Kuhne told CoinDesk the aim is to offer the service to everyone as soon as possible.  He said Huobi is building another service similar to Caimao ""but much more global in scale"".  ""Huobi's long-term vision is a world in which anyone anywhere can invest in anything. Five years ago, the idea of connecting all of the world's capital markets and providing equal access for every person would have seemed like a fantasy, but bitcoin has provided the conceptual and technological foundation for this vision to become a reality.""  ""It certainly won't happen overnight, but this is Huobi's strategic direction and Caimao is our first step,"" he added.  Kuhne also stressed that the Shanghai Stock Exchange shares offered on Caimao were genuine shares, and not just virtual assets representing them.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/05/05/huobi-will-now-take-your-bitcoins-as-stock-trading-collateral,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9c36b78943f0a78164c5de16c10860ce4e5cbb05-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
