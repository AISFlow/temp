The TNC cross-chain asset converter, released at the Beilin Conference, marks a significant landmark in Trinity&apos;s broader application. By using the TNC cross-chain asset converter, TNC can be converted to ERC20 (asset on Ethereum blockchain) from NEP5 (asset on NEO blockchain). We believe the conversion brings the following benefits. ERC20 TNCs can be used on more exchanges that only support Ethereum assets, thus increasing liquidity. Apart from buying on exchanges, we can get ERC20 TNCs by converting NEP5 TNCs.

42428722,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLdmDh,1522273905,Report: Two Japanese Crypto Exchanges to Shut Down,"Two cryptocurrency exchanges in Japan are reportedly set to cease operating amid growing scrutiny from regulators in the wake of a $500 million theft.  According to Nikkei, two exchanges – Mr. Exchangehttps://mr.exchange/en-JP and Tokyo GateWay – are withdrawing previously filed applications with Japan's Financial Services Agency (FSA) in which they sought approval to launch services to domestic customers.  No official statements have been published by either exchange as of press time, though Mr. Exchange posted on March 8 that it had received an order requiring it to beef up its internal protocols in the wake of the attack on Coincheck in late January. The incident resulted in approximately $533 million worth of the cryptocurrency NEM token being stolen.  Per Nikkei's report, the closures won't occur until user funds have been withdrawn or otherwise returned.  Still, the development is notable, as earlier this month, Japanese regulators suspended two cryptocurrency exchanges, FSHO and Bit Station, citing security flaws. According to Nikkei, Bit Station has withdrawn its application with the agency, as have two others: Raimu and bitExpress.  ""More are expected to follow, as the FSA has given several exchanges a chance voluntarily close before ordering them to do so,"" the news service added.  Exchanges in Japan are required to register with the FSA, as mandated by a law that went into effect last March. While a number of exchanges have received licenses to date, the agency has nonetheless stepped up its oversight of the industry in the wake of the Coincheck hack.

42428730,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLdmTh,1522272055,Judge Backs FTC Asset Freeze in Crypto Fraud Case,"The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is seeking to permanently freeze the assets of four men accused of running cryptocurrency referral scams.  The U.S. regulator also asked a federal court in Florida to order the defendants to stop working together or creating new business entities. Further, they would have to provide a list of their assets to the FTC if the proposed injunction is enforced.  As previously reported  , the FTC sued the four individuals in the Florida court earlier this month, accusing them of promoting fraudulent referral investment schemes. At the time, the agency said that ""this case shows that scammers always find new ways to market old schemes.""  U.S. Magistrate Judge Lurana Snow recommended that the court grant FTC's motion for a preliminary injunction in a court report dated March 23.  ""Based on the argument of the plaintiff’s counsel and evidence presented, the Court is persuaded that Plaintiff is likely to succeed on the merits and that injunctive relief is in the public interest,"" Snow wrote. The motion still has to be approved by District Judge K. Michael Moore, however.  The motion followed a temporary restraining order, which Snow also supported, that provisionally froze the assets of My7Network and the Bitcoin Funding Team, as well as Thomas Dluca, Louis Gatto, Eric Pinkston and Scott Chandler.  According to the filing, Snow's report and recommendation followed a public hearing that the defendants did not attend.  The proposed injunction accuses the defendants of acting deceptively, stating:  ""Based upon the [evidence] submitted by the FTC, there is good cause to believe that Defendants Dluca, Gatto, Pinkston, and Chandler have engaged in and are likely to engage in acts or practices that violate Section 5(a) of the FTC Act.""  According to the filing, if Judge Moore grants the motion, the defendants will have two weeks from Snow's report to object. If they do not, they will be unable to appeal the ruling ""except upon grounds of plain error if necessary in the interest of justice.""  Because the temporary restraining order would expire before this two-week period ends, it has been extended until April 9 by Judge Moore, court filings show.  The original TRO was granted near the end of February, but its enforcement was not revealed until mid-March.

Yonhap News  reported Tuesday that the bank's survey examined cryptocurrency awareness among 2,511 Korean residents, with the age of the respondents ranging from people in their twenties to their seventies.  Notably, the survey found that roughly 30% of people in their twenties and 40% of those in their thirties are familiar with cryptocurrencies, while only 21.6% of the overall group was aware of the tech.  Perhaps unsurprisingly, the numbers were not as high among the older generations: only the older generations, 5.7% of people in their sixties and 2.2% of people in their seventies had any knowledge of cryptocurrencies.  Younger survey participants also displayed a greater appetite for investing in cryptocurrencies. Some 24.2% of those in their twenties said they were ""eager to invest in cryptocurrencies,"" according to Yonhap, compared to 20.1% for those in the thirties age-group.  Yonhap noted that an estimated 2 million people currently own cryptocurrencies in South Korea, or about 4% of the country's roughly 52 million residents, which is perhaps reflective of the fast-growing market for trading there.  And while Korean officials have reportedly raided three different exchanges as part of a larger embezzlement probe – signaling that regulators have no plans to stop policing the space – other firms are entering the market to capitalize on the interest.

XRP joins Uphold’s existing list of currencies and cryptocurrencies that can be bought or traded, with bitcoin, ethereum and bitcoin cash, among others, already on the menu.  According to vice chairman J.P. Thieriot, the move follows a Twitter poll earlier this month that indicated XRP was the most-desired token to be added, taking 51 percent of just over 12,000 votes. It also comes following a $57.5. million investment from former Ripple chief risk officer Greg Kidd in January, and Uphold's acquisition of mobile commerce platform Cortex MCP a month later.

We have to create an integration with a third party. In the case of XRP, it’s an entirely new blockchain – it’s not like adding an ERC-20 token, which is relatively trivial for us.""  XRP can be exchanged with no fees being charged, and can be traded or used in transactions across Uphold’s existing offerings, according to statements. These include seven cryptocurrencies and 23 fiat currencies, on top of four precious metals.  According to Uphold, the next phase of support involves integrating with the Ripple network itself, enabling direct deposits and withdrawals via the mainnet.

As of writing, the bitcoin cash/bitcoin (BCH/BTC) exchange rate is seen a 0.1104 BTC on Bitfinex – the lowest level since March 9. BCH had dropped to a low of 0.10723 BTC on March 7, but defended the falling channel support, as seen on the chart below.  Daily chart  In the subsequent days, the BCH/BTC ratio has regained poise, but the demand for BCH, the world's fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was not strong enough to push through the falling channel hurdle.  The corrective rally ran out of steam at the three-week high of 0.12489 BTC on March 17. Since then, the bitcoin cash bulls have made numerous attempts to scale the falling channel resistance. However, as the chart shows, the resistance proved a tough nut to crack and the BCH/BTC pair ended up creating lower highs along the channel resistance.  Further, BCH/BTC created a ""gravestone"" doji-like pattern yesterday, signaling that the bulls are leaving the market.  The momentum studies are biased to the bears too, with the 5-day moving average (MA) and 10-day MA both heading south currently.

In the document released on Sunday, the bank provided three primary reasons why it is overall ""negative"" towards cryptocurrencies, despite the growing attention they have received from among consumers and investors.  Since cryptocurrencies do not come with central bank backing, the report states, they lack protections for consumers and investors. Further, high volatility and a lack of pricing transparency provide ""very limited insight"" into market development and factors affecting prices. And, finally, a lack of regulatory oversight means cryptocurrencies are a target for criminals, it says.  Therefore, according to the bank, ""we strongly recommend that our customers avoid investing in cryptocurrencies.""  The report continues:  ""For these reasons, it is not possible to trade cryptocurrencies on our trading platforms. However, we monitor the market closely, and if the cryptocurrency market becomes more transparent and mature, we might reconsider this position.""  Danske Bank says it is also phasing out the option of buying financial instruments, such as derivatives or exchange traded notes (ETNs), that are linked to the price of cryptocurrencies.

42428734,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLdmbh,1522238411,Sharding Is Ushering in Radical Ethereum Designs,"So-called ""sharding"" may still be theoretical, but the promising implications of the concept are becoming more and more real.  At least that's the case on ethereum, where developers are beginning to see the scaling solution, which would essentially split the blockchain into parts that would run on different servers, as an opportunity to test fundamental assumptions about one of the world's largest cryptocurrencies.  Although initial roadmaps are just now being discussed, ambitious coders are already jumping to introduce protocol-level redesigns that could be made possible by the upgrade.  “Sharding is a huge, huge change to the network,” said Phil Daian, a researcher at Cornell University's Initiative for Cryptocurrency and Contracts (IC3). “A lot of people think it provides an opportunity to redesign economic models and other aspects of the system.""  For Daian, the realization comes on the heels of a developer retreat in Taipei, where, sharding, and other speculative changes, were discussed. Now, along with an all-star team of co-founders including Ari Juels, Lorenz Breidenbach and Florian Tramer, he putting his efforts into an initiative aimed to redesign ethereum to work more efficiently, Project Chicago.  The project is trying to identify exactly what commodities are being traded at the core of ethereum today. By isolating a variety of network elements, like its gas, storage and UTXO transaction data, the team plans to implement protocol-level markets for what they call “crypto commodities.”  ""We want to look at all of the services and resources the network is providing and say, 'OK, how do we create a market-based system for price discovery and the incentivization of this,'"" Daian told CoinDesk in interview.  The researchers were inspired to create the concept after developing a tool called GasToken, which allows ethereum users to store gas (ethereum's token for paying fees on the network) when it's cheap and sell it at a later date when the price is higher.  And while not many people are using the tool yet, it's effectively shone a light on an incentive flaw within the ethereum system in that, as people look to store GasTokens, it further bogs down the ethereum state – the part of the system that keeps track of all possible computations.  Already, the incentive flaw is reigniting discussions about the need for users to pay so-called ""rent"" on the amount of time they need their data to be stored on the blockchain. But because GasToken incentivizes people to hoard their tokens, “it’s a clear artifact to point to show people why today’s model is flawed and why rent needs to be introduced,” Daian said.  Still, this isn't the only thing the researchers at Project Chicago think needs to be redesigned.  And as such, Daian spoke more broadly about sharding, stating:  “It could actually provide a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to radically redesign the system and reset people’s expectations from scratch.”  Futures market inspiration  That's because, according to Project Chicago, at its core, a blockchain is a marketplace, one where miners sell resources allowed by the software to users. Focusing on this, Daian last week drafted an incentive scheme for peer-to-peer networks, one that would not only pay participants for routing transactions, but apply the same logic elsewhere.  “These resources can be anything from block space, to CPU on full nodes, to permanent storage on full nodes, etc. So, we sort of came at this from the beginning, questioning the pricing models that blockchains have today,” Daian said.  Created earlier this year, GasToken was the first step in this direction. In practice, it works by exploiting a feature named “gas refund,” which is intended to incentivize users to delete data. But with GasToken, it's possible to abuse the feature, encouraging users to store and drop contracts, as timely deletions can return higher gas.  Daian described this as a “fundamental mis-pricing” in ethereum, in that it values computation as equivalent to storage. “Because of that, we’ve now created a direct financial incentive for people to bloat the state space and store garbage,” he said.  As well as revealing inefficiencies in ethereum’s incentive structure, GasToken paved the way for a line of inquiry that could be extended deeper into the protocol layer.  “It sort of made us realize that there’s this whole under-researched space of how to deal with these these raw resources that are fundamental to different blockchains today,” Project Chicago’s Tramer told CoinDesk.  By identifying markets for raw resources, Project Chicago intends to pave the way for other financial mechanisms, such as futures. “[We’ll be] looking at different kinds of futures for ethereum, computation, storage and network, and how you can build them,” Daian said.  According to Tramer, by speculating on the availability or scarcity of the underlying resources over time, such markets could potentially mitigate price volatility, just like on traditional markets.  Daian echoed this, telling CoinDesk:  “There are really concrete analogs to the real world here. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) was our inspiration for Project Chicago. And I think a lot of real-world problems could have been avoided by a nicer economic model.”  Luxury blockchains?  However, Daian is aware that by ramping up the markets, such schemes may not prove popular.  For example, an increased number of incentives could lead to centralization, attracting large-scale players to participate in storing or mining the blockchain in exchange for rewards. Daian deflected this though, stating, “My argument would be that you’re essentially saying you’ve introduced an incentive and now it will be vulnerable to economies of scale.”  He continued to say that bigger economies are both positive for security, in increasing the cost of attacks, and an inevitable economic progression, “even if you do fight them,”referring to monero’s recent efforts to defend against large-scale mining.  But there are other potential issues to the mindset, as well. While Project Chicago could provide incentivizes for a host of new participants, such schemes would come at a cost.  For example, rent would mean that token issuers pay a yearly fee to host a smart contract on ethereum, which, failing renewal, could lead the contract to be deleted.  According to Daian, it’s possible that new charges could drive users away. “It is worth saying that for all of these crypto commodities, a big is risk in my mind is that people sort of like the cheaper, subsidized model,” he said.  Plus, in a competitive market for blockchains, new cryptocurrencies could emerge that offer free usage in the short term, “because there’s not that much demand, and perhaps there’s good supply.”  And while the new incentives could be a big improvement for speed, as well as scaling and decentralization, it’s not clear how much those attributes are valued by users.  Daian concluded:  “I think people are going to have to start valuing decentralization and incentive compatibility and robustness with their wallets. And it’s not really clear to me whether or not they do.”  Shards of glass image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Rachel-Rose O'Leary,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/03/28/sharding-is-ushering-in-radical-ethereum-designs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c02bb2eddf657fcd49e216ff5814cd10a4a800af-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42428739,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLdmlh,1522233602,Why Bitcoin's 'Death Cross' May Be a Bear Trap,"Bitcoin risks entering a technical ""death cross"" soon, but the bearish signal will likely not be as severe as has been made out in reports.  A death cross occurs when the 50-day moving average (MA) cuts the 200-day MA from above (bearish crossover), indicating a long-term bear market going forward. As seen on the bitcoin daily chart below, the 50-day MA looks set to dip below the 200-day MA imminently.  Daily chart  Some strategists are saying that the death cross could yield a big sell-off in BTC, possibly to as low as $2,800, a level last seen in September 2017. However, such fears are likely overstated, as the crossover tends to work as a contrarian indicator – that is, they tend to occur at the end of a big bear move, with prices rallying soon after.  Further, it takes a great amount of effort on the part of the bears to push the 50-day MA below the 200-day MA. For instance, BTC turned lower from the $20,000 mark in mid-December when the 50-day MA was still rising.  The moving average adopted a bearish bias (began sloping downwards towards the 200-day MA) after BTC fell to $6,000 on Feb. 6. Since then, BTC has created lower highs (bearish setup) around $11,700 (March 5 high) and $9,177 (March 21 high) and the 50-day MA has slowly closed-in on the 200-day MA.  To cut a long story short, BTC had to drop by $14,000 (from $20,000 to $6,000) to push the 50-day MA so far towards the 200-day MA. Hence, it's likely that the bears will run out of steam by the time the actual death cross occurs.  In fact, it could end up being a bear trap, at least in the short term. And the historical data seems to support the argument, as explained below.  So, the death cross failed to yield a big sell-off in two out of the last three events, and the odds are high that it would end up being a bear trap for the third time.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $8,050 on Bitfinex. Having failed to beat the resistance around $9,000, the cryptocurrency now looks set to revisit the recent low of $7,240 – a move that would most likely confirm the death cross, but could also push the relative strength index (RSI) near the historical bull reversal zone of 30.00–27.00.  View  A move to $7,240 (recent low) will likely confirm the death cross and may yield further drop towards $6,600. That said, the support will likely hold, with the daily RSI likely to show oversold conditions by then. In the subsequent days, bitcoin may trap th bears on the wrong side of the trade, as seen in April 2014 and September 2015.  However, if BTC finds acceptance below $6,600, a further sell-off to sub-$6,000 levels cannot be ruled out.

In its annual report for 2017, published Tuesday, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) said that, out of the 453 fintech enquiries it received last year, 60 percent of them (271 cases) were focused on blockchain, cryptocurrency, ICOs and smart contract applications.  The number marks a nearly three-fold growth compared to 2016's data, when FINMA saw only around 60 blockchain-related enquires out of a total 270 cases (22 percent).  The growth in enquiries around blockchain tech comes at a time when the Swiss regulator has placed the topic as the center of its supervisory work, the agency said, adding that questions around ICOs are becoming increasingly frequent.  ""Especially in the second half of the year (2017), there was a sharp increase in enquiries about raising capital via ICOs,"" FINMA commented in the report.  Notably, the Swiss regulator took measures in September of last year to investigate ICOs that were deemed suspect by the agency, ultimately ordering the closure of three entities tied to an alleged scam called E-coin.  And, just last month, FINMA also updated its guidelines on how its will treat various tokens issued through ICOs, saying it will treat some as securities. The agency said it would examine tokens on a case-by-case basis, outlining three main categories to further clarify the process.  In a news conference on Tuesday, the agency's chief executive, Mark Branson, said his agency is confident in the efficiency of the new guidelines and is now actively examining ICOs already completed under the new framework, according to Reuters.

The IAC first announced the initiative – dubbed the Global Blockchain Investment and Development Center – in mid-March, with plans for it to be overseen by the organization's Foreign Investment Committee.  According to CoinDesk's report at the time, the new center had been intended to provide the necessary funding for blockchain projects seen to have high potential in China after the IAC observed the growing popularity of the technology in the country. Other areas of focus were said to be providing consulting services to institutions interested in investing in blockchain initiatives.

42401371,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcbUGU,1522224042,Hyperledger Tech Heats Up Ahead of Software Debuts,"Just six minutes.  That's how long Hyperledger executive director Brian Behlendorf had to get former Chilean president Michelle Bachelet up to speed on blockchain. Spurred by a special request from the nation's lawmakers, Behlendorf was one of multiple blockchain experts called to the country to talk about the merits of the technology and the ways in which it could modernize the copper-rich nation's mining supply chain.  But even with such a short amount of time, Behlendorf believes he succeeded.  ""She was interested, and she wanted to learn more,"" he told CoinDesk.  Still, if that sounds like a tough sell, Behlendorf has become fast experienced in the art, having completed a whirlwind tour earlier this year. In addition to the meeting in Chile, he also visited Davos, Switzerland, for the World Economic Forum's annual event and Beijing for MIT's enterprise forum on blockchain.  And with that foundation laid, Behlendorf is now turning his attention to what will likely end up being the busiest year yet for the non-profit Linux Foundation-led consortium, which comprises 200 banks, large corporates and startups.  To start, the consortium is preparing to move three more open-source enterprise-grade blockchain platforms into version 1.0 status (currently there are only two platforms that far along), and launch its first-ever enterprise blockchain tool.  Collectively, these launches signify more than just milestones for the developers behind them, but could help lay the foundation for a wide range of applications finally able to conduct enterprise-grade transactions  Behlendorf said:  ""The 1.0 is really a signal from the developers that they feel this code is now ready for production use with real digital assets, which is a pretty high bar, much higher than most organizations might put on their own 1.0.""  Enterprise ethereum  The first of the blockchain platforms expected to launch is Hyperledger Burrow, which will also be the first Hyperledger platform designed specifically for ethereum.  The codebase is currently in the final stages of development before moving to the Hyperledger Technical Steering Committee for approval, which is expected to be sometime this quarter. Built by blockchain startup Monax, the platform comes with a tailor-made ethereum virtual machine (EVM), deployable in internal enterprise operations, enterprise consortia and in more traditional public blockchains.  While the exact number of people using the platform is unclear, Monax CEO Casey Kuhlman said it will at least be included in the upcoming launch of an ""agreements network"" designed to create legal contracts.  As part of a larger trend towards blockchain interoperability, Monax was among the earliest Hyperledger projects to see its technology integrated with another solution – in this case, Hyperledger Sawtooth – to execute ethereum smart contracts on the Intel-contributed platform.  Going forward, Kuhlman hopes a similar integration that occurred with Sawtooth will proceed within a project currently underway using IBM-contributed Hyperledger Fabric.  ""We are hopeful to continue working closely with the IBM engineers to ensure that Burrow's EVM is suitable for their chaincode system,"" he said.  Blockchain Facebook  With digital identity emerging as such a hot topic (think the Cambridge Analytica fiasco), many developers will no doubt also be interested in Hyperledger Indy, another platform expected to launch into version 1.0 this year.  Contributed last year by blockchain identity startup Evernym, the tool is designed to give people ownership of their own identity data.  So far, the non-profit Sovrin Foundation is building on the platform, plus distributed ledger consortium R3 is exploring integration with its Corda platform. On top of that, two European power companies are looking into using the technology, and 25 ""stewards,"" including T-Mobile's T-Lab, have joined to operate validator nodes on the decentralized Trust Network.  ""The Indy community is active, growing and working on graduating incubation from Hyperledger,"" said Judd Bagley, the company's senior communications director.  For a mobile device  Distinct from the other solutions moving into version 1.0 this year, Hyperledger Iroha was built as a mobile-first blockchain.  Contributed by Tokyo-based fintech startup Soramitsu, with support from Hitachi, NTT Data and Colu, the Iroha consensus algorithm was designed specifically to enable blockchain-based solutions on mobile devices that have lower processing power. The platform also supports the creation of a number of crypto assets.  Last April, Iroha announced a partnership with the Central Bank of Cambodia to explore possible use of the technology.  Then, in December, the platform quietly entered the alpha 1.0 stage on Github and, according to Soramitsu co-founder Makoto Takemiya, is now in the final stages of preparing for a full, live launch.  ""We are planning to release our version 1.0 final in May,"" Takemiya said.  The key tool  These series of developments are a notable shift from last year when the lack of enterprise blockchain launches gave naysayers plenty of fuel for criticism.  But this year, starting with the launch of Intel-contributed Hyperledger Sawtooth 1.0 (which has already seen early-stage use by the likes of T-Mobile and Huawei) it seems the groundwork is finally being laid for real enterprise blockchain growth.  This includes IBM's second contribution to Hyperledger, that is also moving into 1.0 status – a tool called Hyperledger Composer. The first tool to move into ""live"" status, it's a actually combination of multiple developer tools designed to accelerate blockchain application development.  Since being contributed last year, Composer is already being used by a number of enterprises according to a Don Thibeau, offering manager of IBM Blockchain. Though few details about that work are being revealed, software giant SAP announced earlier this year that it was using the technology in conjunction with its internal cloud.  ""Through the use of JavaScript and common developer tools, Hyperledger Composer has made blockchain development accessible to a wide ecosystem of existing developers and students,"" Thibeau said.  And with more and more blockchain platforms and tools moving into 1.0 status, Behlendorf expects a corresponding increase in live applications.  ""There's traction behind each of them, there are multiple companies now participating in development, they are maturing at a rate where they're ready for production use,"" he said, adding:  ""And in some cases are already in production use.""

42401379,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcbUOM,1522206336,A G20 Crypto Policy? Let's Hope It's a Pipe Dream,"Marc Hochstein is the managing editor of CoinDesk.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.      ""Let's form a committee to explore the formation of an exploratory committee!""  OK, that's not quite a fair summation of the recommendations on cryptocurrency that came out of the G20 meeting of finance ministers last week. But it's safe to say the globally unified policy that the world's economic leaders are now seeking could be a long time coming, if it comes at all.  And whether such coordination would be a positive for the crypto community is also questionable.  For those who were too transfixed on bitcoin's price gyrations to pay attention to the bureaucrats gathering in Buenos Aires (I don't blame you a bit), here's a quick recap.  The member nations present agreed that cryptocurrencies needed to be examined, but that more information was required before any regulations could be proposed, according to the press briefing by Argentina's central bank chief, Frederico Sturzenegger.  While that sounds like punting, the members did set a firm deadline in July for recommendations on what data is needed, Sturzenegger told reporters.  Once you've digested that, here's one more spoonful of alphabet soup: In its report to the G20, another intergovernmental body, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), called for cooperation on studying the tax consequences of cryptocurrencies.  In addition to moving slowly (much slower than the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency markets), the G20 faces other limitations. It can only make recommendations, not set policy, for sovereign nations, and you don't have to be Steve Bannon to be thankful for that.  And while the G20 includes some big countries, absent are some of the most vocally blockchain-friendly jurisdictions, such as Switzerland, Singapore, Gibraltar and Bermuda, a fact which may further limit the impact of any cooperation among the members.  Successful models  So, is a globally coordinated policy even possible in the best of times for international cooperation, much less the age of Trump and Brexit?  John Collins, the president of consulting firm Red Flag USA and former head of policy for crypto exchange Coinbase, thinks so.  While there will always be outlier jurisdictions, ""to the extent you want to play in the biggest markets in the world, those tend to be the supporters of these international standards,"" he said.  As for resurgent nationalism's threat to global coordination, Collins noted that in this case, cryptocurrency – a technology that knows no borders – ""is inherently inconsistent with most nationalist tendencies – which is usually based in sovereign control.""  One successful example of international cooperation Collins cites is the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an intergovernmental body dedicated to fighting money laundering and terrorism financing.  Countries that don't follow FATF's extensive standards (somewhat euphemistically called ""recommendations"") for anti-money-laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) policies get put on a blacklist of ""non-cooperative"" countries. Aside from losing face, that means residents of a country may have a harder time opening foreign bank accounts or sending money abroad, and may even pay higher interest rates for financing.  Indeed, in Buenos Aires the G20 pledged to implement the FATF standards ""as they apply to crypto-assets.""  Now, note the awkward phrasing there. ""As they apply to."" The current FATF standards do not address cryptocurrencies. While the FATF has issued guidance on the matter, that's not the same thing. Only the standards have teeth.  By applying general standards written for the traditional financial system to the brave new world of crypto, the G20 is ""taking a circular approach to mitigating AML and CTF around digital currencies and isn’t really addressing digital currencies at all,"" said Christine Duhaime, an AML lawyer in Canada who advises digital currency companies.  Nevertheless, the power of the blacklist shows that these transnational bodies can have a strong influence. Another example cited by Collins is the Basel Committee standards for bank capital.  ""It's certainly not easy and the Basel process is particularly deliberative, but it's certainly not impossible,"" Collins said. ""And it's important to remember that, in the case of Basel for example, particular countries who tend to object or slow down these processes, often have deep-rooted and massive industries that they are attempting to protect.""  Yet cryptocurrency, for all the progress it's made, is neither massive nor deep-rooted, so the industry might not be able to lobby against governments adopting international standards as successfully as, say, small banks in the U.S. fought adoption of the Basel II standard in the early 2000s.  Consistency vs. control  All right, so a global policy on crypto is theoretically possible – but should the community welcome it? According to Collins, who is also a former Senate staffer, it depends on your business model.  In countries such as the U.S. and Japan ""that instituted regulatory clarity around exchanges – those businesses centered in those countries have done exceedingly well,"" he said. ""It gives confidence to users and investors, which is good for the industry.""  But Collins acknowledged that this isn't just any industry, but one ""whose core [goal] is decentralizing power structures."" Hence, ""industry compliance and coordination is even more difficult than it is in other competitive industries.""  As someone who appreciates that guiding philosophy of decentralization, I felt a bit of a chill when Collins described a possible future scenario.  ""The question will be at what point the policy levers move from the entry and exit points to the financial system [i.e. exchanges where crypto is traded for fiat] to the underlying protocols themselves,"" he said. ""If that ever happens, that will be a different paradigm that crypto businesses, whatever their model, will likely need to address head on.""  Regulating the protocols? Say what you will about Bannon, thoughts like that make me think it's good to have such a firebrand in crypto's corner.
