42426587,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJuG1h,1450304090,McKinsey Report Predicts Four Stages of Blockchain Adoption,"The wider adoption of blockchain technology by financial incumbents is likely to take place over four stages according to a new report by business management consultant firm McKinsey & Company.  Entitled ""Beyond the Hype: Blockchains in Capital Markets"", the report states that blockchain technology will ""dramatically reshape the capital markets industry"", impacting business models, cost savings and capital requirements in the sector.  McKinsey contends the adoption of blockchain technology will have significant near-term benefits, bringing faster clearing and settlement to the capital markets, while reducing the number of ledgers needed to be maintained by financial institutions and ensuring audit trails are more precise.  However, McKinsey's chief finding is that the financial industry needs to move in unison to unlock the benefits of the blockchain, a conclusion that supports recent efforts by major banks to back efforts like distributed ledger consortium R3.  The report states:  ""The full potential of blockchain technology will only be realized through cooperation among market participants, regulators and technologists and this may take some time.""  Roadblocks to deployment, the report suggested, include the irreversible nature of blockchain databases, which would require that those who participate in running such a network agree on mechanisms to resolve conflicts.  However, the McKinsey report does provide a detailed roadmap for how it expects this transition to play out, despite challenges, providing financial institutions with a window into how they might be able to prepare for the transition to distributed financial technologies.  Four stages  Armed with these benefits, McKinsey argues the rollout of the technology will occur in four steps, with a distributed ledger first uniting all of a financial institution’s legal entities.  In this scenario, each of a company's legal entities would act as a ""node and bookkeeper"" on the distributed ledger, a development that would provide the organization the chance to ""rewire"" its existing platforms.  ""Design issues could be internally resolved and modified with experience over time. This first step could also solve for moving assets into and out of a closed blockchain network,"" it says.  From this point, blockchain technology can scale up by replacing the manual processes at a subset of banks, providing what McKinsey called a ""solid testing ground"" for the tech.  ""Small networks of market participants could convene to agree on standards and protocols for booking and transfer with relatively little investment and with the potential to improve current operations,"" the report reads.  This stage would be followed by the conversion of inter-dealer-dominated markets and finally the large-scale adoption by buyers and sellers in public markets.  Early observations  Today, McKinsey found blockchain adoption is happening most rapidly in over-the-counter markets, where ""volumes are lower and operations are more manual"".  Other areas where blockchain solutions are likely to proliferate, the report said, are in asset-backed securities, precious metals, repurchase agreements, syndicated bank debt, title insurance and unregistered securities.  Many of the use cases targeted by early entrants into the bitcoin space, the report suggested, will need longer to develop.  Notably, this includes the application of the technology in the payments sector:  ""Over time, developments in currency trading based on experience in bitcoin markets may seep into foreign exchange (FX) businesses, as bitcoin exchanges obtain the licenses to accept cash deposits. And application of blockchain technology in the payments space may move beyond the current retail focus.""

42426581,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJuFnh,1450296135,Report: Japanese Officials Draft Regulation for Bitcoin Exchanges,"Japan's financial regulators are reportedly moving closer to creating a system for registering and overseeing domestic digital currency exchanges.  Citing ""informed sources"", The Japan Times reports a working group beneath the Financial Services Agency's Financial System Council is finalizing a draft text that, once finished, will be submitted to the country's legislature, the Diet, next year.  According to the Times, the draft text calls for a range of capital and auditing requirements for those running domestic exchanges, in addition to know-your-customer (KYC) anti-money laundering (AML) mandates.  Another meeting is said to be taking place on Thursday of this week to discuss the proposal.  The Times explained:  ""The draft proposes setting financial conditions that virtual currency exchange operators should meet, such as a certain amount of capital, and requiring them to manage customer assets separately from their own corporate assets. In addition, it calls for introducing a mandatory system for exchange operators to undergo external checks by certified public accountants or auditing firms for their asset management conditions and financial statements.""  News that a draft text has been prepared comes weeks after word emerged that a working group had been convened to consider how exchange activities were regulated.  Japanese officials have called for more stringent measures in the wake of the 2014 collapse of Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange Mt Gox and, later, the arrest of its CEO, Mark Karpeles.  Karpeles is currently being investigated for embezzlement and fraud connected to the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in customer bitcoins.  The FSA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

SBI Sumishin specializes in housing loans, offering ¥2.2tn (about $18.6bn) in housing loans over the course of fiscal year 2015, according to the company’s 2015 annual report.  In statements, NRI senior management director Minoru Yokote cited the project as an example of how the organization is seeking to embrace distributed financial technologies.  Yokote said:  ""NRI is committed to examining technical challenges of blockchain and suggesting ways to apply this technology to the banking industry.""  The country's oldest private think tank, NRI announced it would begin seeking to collaborate with financial incumbents on blockchain projects in October, at the time declining to name any of its potential partners.

42426583,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJuFrh,1450275310,SEC Approves Overstock's Plan to Issue Blockchain Securities,"The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has reportedly approved Overstock's plans to issue stock via the blockchain through its subsidiary tØ platform.  According to Wired, the company was granted an amended Form S-3 – a requirement solely for companies that report under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 – meaning that it could now issue public securities leveraging blockchain technology.  It is still unclear when the company will issue its first public security on a distributed ledger but Patrick Byrne, Overstock's CEO, told Wired:  ""You can assume its high on our list of priorities for 2016.""  Submitted back in April, Overstock's S-3 form application filing outlined how the online retail giant was planning on issuing new stocks or securities, possibly amounting to as much as $500m.  The reports of the approval come after Byrne revealed Overstock's long-awaited blockchain-based private and public equities trading platform – known as tØ – in August this year at Nasdaq's New York headquarters.  According to the US retailer's latest quarterly reports, released in November, Overstock spent $3.2m on its blockchain securities initiative during the previous three months.

The Armenian central bank told regional news service ARKA last month that, in its view, the use of digital currencies should be avoided due to a lack of regulation in the industry. The comments appear to be some of the first from the institution on the technology.  The central bank told ARKA:  ""According to Armenian legislation, virtual currencies, including bitcoins are not considered electronic money. This in view, the regulator calls on citizens to refrain from using them, given the absence of clear-cut approaches on this issue in international practice.""  The central bank further clarified that it supports the use of ""innovative payment instruments"", provided they protect the interests of consumers, according to the news service.
