The San Francisco payments giant reported on Tuesday that the revenue it made from selling bitcoin on Cash App contributed to “48% of total consolidated revenue in 2020, and 85% of the total increase in consolidated net revenues in 2020.”      In the fourth quarter of last year, the company reported $1.76 billion in bitcoin revenue and $41 million in gross profit. Bitcoin costs in the same period were $1.71 billion. The company attributed the increase to the bitcoin bull run and growth in the number of bitcoin customers and the volume of transactions per customer.      “We’re going to focus on increasing transaction limits across the system for Cash App and going to double down on our commitment to bitcoin and look for new ways to connect our products within the Cash App,” Square CEO Jack Dorsey said during an earnings call on Tuesday.      It’s still early days for bitcoin at Square, with only 10% of Cash App customers ""using the bitcoin product,"" said Square Chief Financial Officer Amrita Ahuja.      “We’ve continued to see strong adoption, with 3 million customers [buying bitcoin] through the past year, and in January we saw 1 million new to bitcoin in just one month,” Ahuja said.      In its earnings release the company added:    “The increase was due to the market price of bitcoin, growth in the number of active bitcoin customers, as well as volume per customer. The amount of bitcoin revenue recognized will fluctuate depending on customer demand as well as changes in the market price of bitcoin.”    Additionally, Square announced Tuesday it had added 3,318 BTC to its bitcoin treasury.

42433687,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP2DJh,1614117769,Paxos Plans to File for a Clearing Agency License,"Correction (Feb. 24, 2021, 18:00 UTC): Corrects that Paxos is filing to become a clearing agency like the DTCC, not a clearing firm.      Stablecoin issuer and crypto exchange Paxos is applying to become a clearing agency with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).      Clearing agencies act as intermediaries in the U.S. securities markets, facilitating payments and the transfers of securities for exchanges. If approved, Paxos would become one of just two clearing agencies in the U.S., joining the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC).      Charles Cascarilla, the CEO and founder of Paxos, told CoinDesk TV Tuesday that the company, which already settles U.S. equities trades, was hoping to become a full clearing agency.      “We’re going to be submitting our clearing agency application hopefully in very short order,” he said. “We are really committed to being infrastructure in a similar way to the DTCC.""      There’s no firm timeline for when Paxos might submit the application, and after it does the SEC will likely publish it for a public comment period.      Cascarilla also raised the idea that a blockchain-based clearing system might be more efficient than the current market infrastructure.      “The GameStop issue really highlighted how blockchain infrastructure can help solve a lot of the problems in our markets,” he said, referring to last month’s community-driven pump of GameStop’s stock price. Several brokerages offering GameStop trading had to suspend the stock due to market volatility caused by rising clearing firm costs, which some are attributing to the current two-day lag in settlement time, called T+2.      Under the current system, trades are settled by the DTCC two days after they’re conducted.      A blockchain network lets companies know exactly “who owns what, when,” Cascarilla said, referring to T+0, or same-day settlement. Still, a blockchain might not be the right tool for the job, at least just yet.      Read more: What Really Happened When Robinhood Suspended GameStop Trading      “I don’t know if a public blockchain can handle the level of infrastructure that is needed in the public U.S. equity markets today,” he said. “I think that will be the case in the future but for instance to be able to handle 500 million transactions … that is something that you can’t put through, for instance, the Ethereum blockchain.”      Paxos has also applied to become a nationally chartered bank through the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.

42433709,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP2Dvh,1614116571,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Settles Around $47K After Biggest 2-Day Rout in 11 Months,"Bitcoin’s punishing sell-off appeared to decelerate as prices settled around $47,000, after the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization logged its steepest two-day loss since March 2020 early Tuesday.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $47,851.27 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Slipping 11.72% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $44,964.49-$55,053.91 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC trades below its 10-hour and 50-hour averages on the hourly chart, a bearish signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin’s price tumbled along with U.S. stocks after markets opened in the U.S. Tuesday, bringing the cryptocurrency’s decline since Sunday to 20%, the most for a two-day period since the coronavirus-fueled crash in March 2020. The decline has wiped out more than $100 billion of bitcoin’s market value, which last week climbed past $1 trillion for the first time.      And while many traders are still bullish on bitcoin in the long term, analysts said the largest cryptocurrency may have further to fall in the coming days, traders and analysts said.      As is often the case in digital asset markets, this week’s decline didn’t appear tied to any specific negative news or fundamental data, but to technical factors such as worrisome signals from price charts and a general sense that the market had run too far, too fast: Bitcoin's price had doubled this year to an all-time high price of more than $58,000 as of Sunday.      This week’s price retreat trimmed the 2021 gains by as much as 59%, versus 3.6% for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of U.S. stocks.      “The current market is extremely overheated,” Flex Yang, founder and chief executive officer of Hong Kong-based crypto lender Babel Finance, told CoinDesk. Prices could fall as low as $40,000, he said.      The price move came on strong volume, though, indicating high activity on the part of sellers and buyers alike. Trading volume on eight major exchanges tracked by CoinDesk topped $10 billion for the second straight day.      Signals from the market for bitcoin derivatives showed traders turning slightly less bullish, with futures contract premiums over spot prices shrinking on major exchanges including Deribit, Binance, OKEx and Huobi.      The premiums are still high compared with January levels, indicating the bulls still dominate the market.      Arcane Research, a Norwegian cryptocurrency analysis firm, noted in its weekly newsletter Tuesday that the funding rates – fees that traders pay for leverage – have come down dramatically since Monday, a sign that some of this week’s market rout may have shaken out some of the euphoria.      Funding rates on perpetual futures contracts are set by the market and vary over time as traders put on and take off positions. When the market is bullish, funding rates turn positive and traders taking long positions pay short sellers. When the market is bearish, funding turns negative, and short sellers pay.      Arcane Research also warned that with perpetuals trading again at a “significant” premium to spot prices on Tuesday, the funding rates are poised to rise soon.      “Trying to catch a falling knife is a dangerous exercise, which could ignite a new cascade of liquidations in the near term,” Arcane Research wrote.      There appeared to be little change this week in the outlook for loose monetary policy, which has driven many institutional investors to buy bitcoin as a hedge against eventual inflation. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, in testimony Tuesday before the U.S. Senate Banking Committee, stuck to his prior message that easy monetary policy wouldn’t budge anytime soon, given the need to keep borrowing rates low as long as it takes for the economy to heal.      “We view the current pullback as nothing more than a necessary correction to allow for a very strong market to take time to consolidate and reset before eventually looking to continue on its upward trajectory,” Joel Kruger, cryptocurrency strategist at institutional crypto exchange LMAX Digital, said.      And it appears that some have been buying the latest dip, as CoinDesk reported earlier today.    Ether lower; high fees force more liquidations on DeFi lending platforms    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was down Tuesday, trading around $1,524.42 and sliding 14.08% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      Similar to bitcoin, ether’s trading volume on major exchanges exploded again on Tuesday.      As ether’s price continued to correct, another record-high $115 million in lending positions in decentralized finance (DeFi) based on the Ethereum blockchain were wiped out Tuesday, as reported by CoinDesk.

42433684,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP2DRh,1614115084,Square Buys Another $170M in Bitcoin,"Payments giant Square said Tuesday it had purchased an additional $170 million of bitcoin (BTC), adding to the stash it purchased in October.      Someone should have looked at the price of BTC before that went to press.      According to the payment processor's press release, the company added 3,318 BTC to its treasury for $170 million. Doing the math, that results in a per bitcoin purchase price of $51,235.70.      Unfortunately for Square, after setting a record high above $58,000 over this past weekend, bitcoin hit a recent low of $44,964.49 before rebounding to about $48,408.31 at press time.      When Square's announcement was released, just after 4 p.m. ET, the price of bitcoin was below $48,000, which means those 3,318 BTC were then worth less than $160 million.      In disclosing it's lost more than $10 million on its latest investment in BTC, the company may inadvertently draw attention to an argument JPMorgan analysts made recently about why they think many companies won't follow in the footsteps of Square and others (Tesla, MicroStrategy) that have added BTC to their treasuries: the cryptocurrency's volatility.      Just before the release of its fourth-quarter earnings call the company made the announcement that it had added to the 4,709 BTC it purchased in October 2020, which were worth $50 million at the time. Currently, that investment is worth $224 million and the company’s total value of BTC on Square’s balance sheet is $394 million.

42433702,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP2Drh,1614111938,"In Nigeria, One Bitcoin Can Cost $68,000. Here's Why.","Bitcoin has already passed the $68,000 mark in Nigeria, but that's if you use the official exchange rate.      Awosika Ayodeji, a Nigerian blockchain project designer, isn’t complaining. He is happy to wake up and see bitcoin prices quoted using unofficial U.S. dollar exchange rates because it means he’d be getting more naira per dollar when he converts his crypto earnings to his local currency.      At the same time, however, “buying [bitcoin] becomes more expensive, too,” Ayodeji noted.      On Friday, Nigeria’s official exchange rate for the U.S. dollar was around 380 naira per dollar. Using this rate, a bitcoin listing on peer-to-peer platform LocalBitcoins in Nigeria of around 26,000,000 naira converted to $68,246. On the surface, this looks like a hefty 24% premium, which in this context refers to bitcoin's price being much higher in specific locations than it is on average worldwide.      In Nigeria, these premiums aren’t consistent. On peer-to-peer platform Paxful, the listed bitcoin prices were based on $1 trading for around 475 naira. This rate converted to $54,736, a price much closer to the average bitcoin trading price of the day. In fact, the informal market dollar exchange rate in Nigeria on Friday was around 478 naira, reflecting the rate seen on Paxful and the bitcoin prices listed on LocalBitcoins.      In emerging markets that are facing a currency crisis, bitcoin prices can actually shed light on the informal market for U.S. dollars. In Argentina, Latin American crypto exchange Bitso listed the bitcoin price at 8,700,993 Argentinian pesos on Friday, which converted to a whopping $98,000 using the official exchange rate, which was around 89 Argentine pesos per dollar. But bitcoin listings on exchanges like Bitso indicated the dollar was worth around 150 pesos, reflecting the informal going rate for the dollar.      Yele Bademosi, chief executive officer at social payments app Bundle Africa said exchanges are most likely using informal dollar rates, thus inflating bitcoin's price in local currency. According to Andrés Ondarra, country manager for Argentina at Bitso, the market exchange rate for the dollar is usually higher than the official exchange rate in Argentina as well.      “This is mainly reflecting the difference between the informal U.S. dollar rate and the official one. The gap between the official and the informal dollar in Argentina is around 70%,” Emiliano Limia, press officer at Argentine crypto exchange Buenbit told CoinDesk via an email.      Exchanges using informal rates instead of official ones indicate the local bitcoin markets exist outside of government rules, and that bitcoin trading might reveal the real value of the local currency against the dollar.      According to Gina Pieters, a professor of economics and the University of Chicago who published a paper on how bitcoin can detect exchange rate manipulation and capital controls, bitcoin premiums can occur for a number of reasons.      “It seems unlikely that the price should be that much higher unless there is the manipulation of the nominal exchange rate channel,” Pieters said in an email to CoinDesk, referring to the price of one currency in terms of another.      In fact, the thesis of Pieters’ 2016 paper was that bitcoin trading can be used to approximate unofficial exchange rates, “which, in turn, can be used to detect both the existence and the magnitude of the distortion caused by capital controls and exchange rate manipulations.”    Informal exchange rates    Due to the falling purchasing power of the naira, on any given day, Nigeria has multiple exchange rates for the dollar. The informal exchange rates are typically much weaker, with Nigerians having to dish out more naira per dollar, indicating the local currency may be worth less than what the government says.      According to a chapter in economist Koji Kubo’s book about Myanmar’s foreign exchange market, multiple exchange rates emerge within the unofficial market when governments implement “exhaustive exchange restrictions” or limitations on the amount of foreign currency that could be bought or sold.      In 2020, Argentina’s government imposed strict controls on the purchase of U.S. dollars, restricting the amount of dollars citizens could buy and hold to $200, in an attempt to stop capital from flowing out of the country. The dollar black market flourished as a result, with people scrambling to buy more dollars to protect their wealth, and even paying more pesos per dollar. This quickly spilled over to crypto as Argentines tried to ditch the peso for stronger currencies: demand for bitcoin soared in 2020.      Meanwhile, Nigeria’s facing a U.S. dollar shortage: in 2020, local media reported Nigerian banks were limiting the amount of dollars Nigerians can spend abroad to as low as $500. Thanks to the scarcity of dollars that could not meet local demand, the value of the naira fell in local informal markets as people showed willingness to pay more naira per dollar.      “The general market is now setting the price to $480 as that seems to be the present value generally accepted between buyers and sellers,” Ayodeji said.      The lower informal exchange rate can mean sending money to family in Nigeria or Argentina in bitcoin can be beneficial as one bitcoin can get you more of the local currency, but this also means that the purchasing power of the local currency is weakening. Sending money out of the country can be problematic, as your wealth converts to less dollars.      It’s typically difficult to estimate local informal dollar rates: Ayodeji said black market currency merchants might ask for even more naira per dollar. But bitcoin conversions can calculate a decent estimate, Ayodeji said.    Inflation    Still, premiums can exist even after you factor in the difference in exchange rates. One possible reason is, in countries with high inflation, people may be willing to pay more for bitcoin.      “In the euro area the prices are pretty much the same as spot prices in big centralized exchanges,” Jukka Blomberg, chief marketing officer at LocalBitcoins, said in an email. But “in countries such as Venezuela, there can even be quite big premiums.”      Blomberg explained this is because Venezuelans who are willing to sell their bitcoin in exchange for their local currency typically want a higher premium due to the risk they have to take by accepting a highly inflationary currency such as the bolivar. In Venezuela, where the inflation rate hit a staggering 10 million% in 2019, and the value of the bolivar was dropping almost daily against the U.S. dollar, people began turning to bitcoin. In fact, the local demand for bitcoin drove crypto adoption in Venezuela ahead of other hyperinflationary countries like Argentina.      Nigeria is also an inflationary country, and citizens have been turning to bitcoin to weather value drops in naira. Demand for bitcoin was so high that the central bank of Nigeria first ordered banks to shut down all accounts associated with crypto trading, and released a five-page explainer that said the measure was taken to protect the country’s financial system.      According to Ayodeji, the naira exchange rate on crypto platforms changed drastically the days after the ban was announced, perhaps driven by the panic that followed, and the demand for bitcoin dropping slightly: the unofficial exchange hit between 410 and 420 naira per dollar, Ayodeji said.      “But the market circled back,” he said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/02/23/in-nigeria-one-bitcoin-can-cost-68000-heres-why,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dd426a13aa2c4b4d4fcadead4209175c4414e0de-1500x958.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In a speech Monday for the George Washington University Law School ""Regulating the Digital Economy"" conference, Peirce described DeFi as ""a very good test"" for regulators to regulate in such a way that it empowers investors and markets.  Peirce made reference to ""anti-Wall Street sentiment"" evidenced in events such as the GameStop trading frenzy, which, she said, have ""inspired some to call for throwing the legacy financial system out entirely"" and replace it with DeFi.  Amid suspicions that financial markets are not working for everyone, DeFi is ""building an alternative to the legacy centralized financial system (CeFi)"" with smart contracts replacing intermediaries, according to Peirce.  Peirce concluded that DeFi would be a challenge for regulators but would also provide new tools to meet that challenge, saying, ""The regulator's job is unchanged even though the stage is set with more modern scenery.""

42433703,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP2Dnh,1614103652,What a Transparent Tether Means for Bitcoin,"At stake  This article is excerpted from Blockchain Bites, a daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    Clarity and uncertainty The New York Attorney General’s (NYAG) multi-year investigation into the twinned exchange and stablecoin issuer Bitfinex and Tether’s internal finances has wrapped, with the regulator bringing no formal charges. The firms will pay $18.5 million to settle an inquiry centered on claims that the U.S. dollar stablecoin was not fully backed, but have admitted no wrongdoing.      Tether (USDT) is the largest stablecoin in the crypto economy. In the past year it has grown from $2 billion to $34 billion, and serves a systemically important role for traders, exchanges and virtually all aspects of this emerging financial sector. Since tether’s inception, there have been unanswered questions as to whether this synthetic asset was fully backed by reserves held in a bank account, which Tether claimed.      “Tether’s claims that its virtual currency was fully backed by U.S. dollars at all times was a lie,” Attorney General Letitia James said. According to court documents, Bitfinex and Tether “recklessly and unlawfully covered-up massive financial losses,” “obscured the true risk investors faced,” “were operated by unlicensed and unregulated individuals” and, at one point, lacked a bank account.      Tether looks to have gotten off fairly easy. In addition to the aforementioned fine, the firm will provide regular reports on Tether’s reserves for the next two years. The firm is also barred from operating in New York State.      This increased level of transparency is viewed positively by industry commentators. Castle Island Ventures partner and CoinDesk columnist Nic Carter said this was a historic “derisking event” for the industry. According to Carter, one of the largest hurdles for institutions to enter the market was the lack of certainty around USDT, despite its outsized role.      For instance, JPMorgan analysts said just last week a loss of faith in tether could cause a liquidity crisis in crypto. In addition to questions about USDT’s backing, there have been persistent conspiracies that tether is used to inflate the price of bitcoin.      “I think we can put that to bed now,” Charles Cascarilla, CEO and co-founder of Paxos, said on CoinDesk TV Tuesday morning.      There are still questions about the form these quarterly reports will take, and the level of insight they may provide. “[T]he mandatory reporting and transparency requirements are better, although it will depend on the quality and nature of those reports and disclosures, including whether they are independently audited, etc,” Elizabeth Renieris, founder of HACKYLAWYER and affiliate at the Berkman Klein Center, said in an email.      “Obviously the parties cannot be trusted to tell the truth,” she continued. Though the issue is larger than just Tether: “Until some of the other measures around mandatory reporting and transparency requirements become institutionalized and standardized for stablecoins in general, it won’t mean much,” Renieris said.      One of the most vocal and consistent Tether critics, who goes by the pseudonym Cas Piancey, notes these developments are a “positive thing for Tether, and likely the space as well.”      “I’ll continue [researching and writing on Tether] because there’s still loose ends to tie up in regard to the ongoing CFTC/DOJ actions, but if they start getting regular attestations and being properly regulated then no need to push for that,” he added in a direct message regarding the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice.      Indeed, as Cascarilla said, “In the case of Tether, it’s still unregulated, unaudited and ... that will always create concerns. That doesn’t mean tether is a source of systemic risk.”    Quick bites  Regulatory update  ‘India’s Warren Buffett,’ Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, Backs Bitcoin Ban (CoinDesk)  The European Central Bank (ECB) wants veto power over stablecoins like libra.

42433697,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP2Djh,1614102145,Bitcoin Poised for Further Losses After Two-Day Plunge Wipes Out More Than $100B,"Bitcoin's (BTC) price tumbled along with U.S. stocks, bringing the cryptocurrency’s decline since Sunday to 17%, the most for a two-day period since the coronavirus-fueled crash in March 2020. The decline has wiped out more than $100 billion of bitcoin’s market value, which last week climbed past $1 trillion for the first time.      And while many traders are still bullish on bitcoin in the long term, analysts said the largest cryptocurrency, now changing hands around $47,000, may have further to fall in the coming days, traders and analysts said.      “The current market is extremely overheated,” Flex Yang, founder and chief executive officer of Hong Kong-based crypto lender Babel Finance, told CoinDesk. Prices could fall as low as $40,000, he said.      Bitcoin staged a mini-rebound Tuesday after the New York state attorney general’s office announced a settlement of a dispute involving the stablecoin tether (USDT). But the rally proved short-lived and appeared to peter out as prices approached $50,000.    Buying the dip    Market sentiment remains largely bullish, and there are signs some investors are buying the dip.      In China, demand for tether has gone up, as evidenced by the stablecoin’s premium over the Chinese yuan on over-the-counter trading desks, when prevailing foreign-exchange rates are taken into account.      For example, earlier on Tuesday, a screenshot of Huobi OTC, the similarly named exchange’s fiat-to-crypto trading platform, showed a 2% premium between USDT’s price, expressed in yuan, and the going exchange rate for the Chinese currency in U.S. dollar terms, per Bloomberg data.      Guy Hirsch, managing director for U.S. at eToro, told CoinDesk he saw 26% more new bitcoin positions opened than closed on the trading platform, which would “help drive markets higher in the longer-term.”      ""We don't believe any of the weakness should be construed as being symptomatic of structural weakness or a lack of confidence in crypto assets,” Joel Kruger, cryptocurrency strategist at institutional crypto exchange LMAX Digital, said. “There will once again be tremendous opportunity for existing players to increase exposure and new participants to take on fresh exposure into the dip.”",NEGATIVE,BTC | USDT,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | USDT,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/02/23/bitcoin-poised-for-further-losses-after-two-day-plunge-wipes-out-more-than-100b,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5b4673429fd2f753f4f1311da392fad8789dbeab-1200x576.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433698,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP2Dlh,1614096300,State of Crypto: The US Government Keeps Mentioning Terrorism,"Welcome to State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. I’m your host, Nikhilesh De.      The past two months have seen multiple government officials discuss crypto projects in the same breath as the Jan. 6 insurrection. This is a potential sign that regulators might tie cryptocurrencies to domestic terrorism.    Frequent refrain  Key narrative    The Subcommittee on National Security, International Development and Monetary Policy, a part of the House Financial Services Committee, will hold a hearing on Thursday titled “Dollars against Democracy: Domestic Terrorist Financing in the Aftermath of Insurrection.” While it’s unclear what the subcommittee plans to focus on, likely to come up is a December transaction of 13.5 bitcoin, worth around $500,000 at the time, to far-right figures who may have been present at the Jan. 6 Capitol Hill insurrection in Washington, D.C.    Why it matters    Is this part of a larger trend? U.S. goverment officials, particularly Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, have mentioned cryptocurrencies in relation to domestic terrorism multiple times over the past two months. Congresspeople are investigating whether DLive, a crypto-based video streaming project associated with the Tron Foundation, was used to fund insurrectionists at the Capitol on Jan. 6.      It is worth paying attention to how government officials are discussing cryptocurrencies and what that could mean for the industry.    Breaking it down    Details are currently scarce about this week’s House hearing. There’s still no witness list or hearing memo (CoinDesk reached out to the Chair of the subcommittee, but had not heard back by press time). But here’s what we know so far:    Secretary Yellen has now said on three different occasions there are concerns about crypto use in terrorism, most recently saying, “Cryptocurrencies have been used to launder the profits of online drug traffickers; they’ve been a tool to finance terrorism.”  Reps. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.) and Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) have asked Justin Sun and DLive CEO Charles Wayn if “foreign-based blockchain donations” went to individuals present on Capitol Hill on Jan. 6.  Earlier this month, Buzzfeed News published a confidential Treasury Department assessment about how cryptocurrencies were being used by terrorists overseas. The assessment mentioned mixers and other privacy-enhancing tools, according to the report.  If we zoom out a bit, the U.S. Department of Justice just charged three North Korean programmers with allegations of stealing $100 million in crypto (as part of a broader scheme that let the hackers steal $1.3 billion).The DOJ also alleges these programmers tried raising funds in an initial coin offering (ICO) to fund the North Korean government.  The United Nations has said North Korea is using its crypto programs to fund its nuclear program.    How crypto is perceived in the halls of government will help determine what sort of regulations are enforced. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), for example, is still considering a proposed rule that would force onerous identification requirements onto crypto exchanges sending funds to private wallets. While this rule is currently on a sort of pause during an extended comment period, some version of it could still be implemented in a few months.      When it comes to the Jan. 6 insurrection in particular, I expect these questions to come up during the hearing:    Can these bitcoin transactions be tracked (yes, for the most part) or prevented (maybe)?  Has crypto been used by individuals barred from centralized payment processors?  Are there laws in place to address these sorts of transactions?    Let’s see where lawmakers land on these issues.    Tether    NY AG’s $850M Probe of Bitfinex, Tether Ends in an $18.5M Settlement. The New York Attorney General’s office settled with Bitfinex and Tether today. In short: The companies will pay $18.5 million as a fine and provide quarterly reports breaking down how much of the USDT reserve is in cash or a cash equivalent. My initial takeaway is this seems to be a positive sign for the companies. My big question is, what do these reports look like? Will they be attestations or something else? For more details, see my full report here.    Robinhood    The full House Financial Services Committee held its first hearing on the GameStop pump last week. I live-tweeted it. The 5.5 hour hearing seemed fairly positive for the crypto industry, I think, in the sense that lawmakers were largely looking at Wall Street as the villains rather than the retail traders who boosted GameStop’s share price.      Most of the lawmakers focused on the actions of Robinhood, and to a somewhat lesser degree Citadel and Melvin Capital, rather than on the behavior of the r/WallStreetBets participants. A few representatives did ask whether posts on Reddit were being manipulated by foreign or malign actors, and whether or not the Chinese government was stealing data. But by and large the emphasis was on piecing together what actually happened or grandstanding about Robinhood’s practices.      A lot of the questions were focused on Robinhood’s suspension of GME trading (and other securities), its payment for order flow model, margin requirements, etc.      I wrote a few weeks ago that my initial takeaway from the episode was that a properly decentralized crypto entity might be able to operate without fear of a shutdown by the Securities and Exchange Commission. So far at least, that thesis hasn’t been challenged much. Based on that initial hearing, if it’s a group of folks who aren’t just trying to manipulate a stock to make a profit off other folks, there’s not a whole lot out there to indicate they’re going to get dinged.      Still, the SEC has yet to weigh in, though the House committee Chair ,Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), has promised to hold a hearing with the regulators to talk about GameStop.      Side note: One of the heroes of the hearing, according to r/WSB, was Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.), the famously anti-crypto congressman who once compared libra to 9/11.    Biden’s rule    Gary Gensler, former CFTC Chair and President Joe Biden’s nominee to head the SEC, will face his confirmation hearing next Tuesday at 10 a.m. ET. Rohit Chopra, formerly of the Federal Trade Commission, will also sit for a confirmation hearing to become director of the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau. As far as I know, both are expected to be confirmed.    Changing of the guard  Elsewhere:  “I don’t see any reason why there can’t be a coexistence of a central bank digital currency and … cryptocurrencies,” said Jim Cunha, a senior vice president at the Boston branch of the Federal Reserve. Speaking on CoinDesk TV with anchor Christine Lee, Cunha also discussed the Boston Fed’s current work with the MIT Digital Currency Initiative exploring a digital dollar. Also showing support for a central bank digital currency: Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.  Brave Browser Was Exposing Addresses in Tor Mode for Months: My colleague Ben Powers reported that the Brave browser had been leaking Tor domain requests to internet service providers for months. In other words, people who thought they were privately searching for domains in Brave were essentially doing so publicly. Brave said it patched the vulnerability last Friday.  Shares in Iced-Tea Maker-Turned Blockchain Firm Delisted by SEC: Anyone who was in the crypto space in December 2017 probably remembers when Long Island Iced Tea announced it was rebranding itself as Long Blockchain in an effort to boost its stock price and prevent Nasdaq from delisting it. This move succeeded, for about two months, before Nasdaq delisted the shares of Long Blockchain anyway. Three years later (yesterday), the SEC has now revoked the former iced tea purveyor’s registration, ending its stock market ambitions for good.  MoneyGram Puts Relationship With Ripple’s XRP on Hold: MoneyGram, which Ripple partnered with (and took a stake in) in 2019, is suspending its usage of Ripple's On-Demand Liquidity product, at least until Ripple’s current legal fight with the SEC is concluded. The SEC filed an amended complaint last week, adding some new details but not changing its charges. I'll be talking about this case tonight during a virtual panel hosted by the New York Financial Writers’ Association at 7:00 p.m. ET. Come check it out.  Outside crypto:  Highlights From the House COVID Bill (NPR): The U.S. House of Representatives looks to be on track to approve a massive, $1.9 trillion stimulus bill that would include $1,400 relief checks for individuals, rental existence, unemployment benefits, parental support and other forms of financial assistance.  Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will appear before the Senate Banking Committee today and House Financial Services Committee tomorrow to give his semi-annual report on the state of the economy. There is some concern about inflation, and the market will be looking to hear his long-term view on the economy.  One last note: Last week I wrote that the Financial Accounting Standards Board hadn't created any guidance around digital assets, which means Tesla's bitcoin buy will have some tax reporting weirdness. A reader pointed out that the FASB can set policy for financial reporting standards but the IRS still creates the actual rules around this space. Mea culpa and thanks for keeping me honest!

Hong Kong and Thailand previously collaborated on Project-Inthanon-Lionrock in Q4 2019 which developed a DLT-based prototype allowed participating banks to conduct payments on a peer-to-peer basis, removing clearing and settlement pain points.  Under its new name, the m-CBDC Bridge will expand across more central banks, which will evaluate its feasibility on a pan-Asian and eventually wider basis.

The cryptocurrency has shed 9% in the past 24 hours, according to the CoinDesk 20.      Compound Finance saw the largest number of liquidated positions with some $86 million, or 75% of the total liquidations coming from that platform, according to data provider DeBank.      MakerDAO followed in a distant second with some $10 million in liquidations, or 8% of the total. Aave v1 and v2 combined for a total of $13 million, or 11% in liquidations.      A sharp 15% correction in the price of ether Monday caused some $25 million in loan liquidations, a three-month high. Nov. 25 saw the previously highest liquidation volume for the emerging financial tech stack with $93 million liquidated.      Historically high gas fees may be one reason mass liquidations are taking place on the lending platforms. The cost of an average transaction set records yet again Tuesday with new highs of $39 for a basic ether transaction, according to data provider Blockchair. For many loans, forcing a liquidation by not closing or topping off the position may end up being cheaper due to high transaction costs.

42433674,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP0TVh,1614094020,How Coinbase Is Worth $100B,"The capital markets feel like one giant game. With the profound volatility of crypto assets, the billions of issuance in special purpose acquisitions companies (SPAC) trying to take fintechs public and incredible monetary printing by the U.S. government, it is hard to know whether anything has real value. The animal spirits are on full display.      It is in this fantastical moment that Coinbase, a household name for crypto trading, is planning its direct listing. The implications of such an offering is liquidity for founders, investors and employees, as well as the opportunity for deep visibility into Coinbase’s economics. Is the company worth $10 billion? Or $100 billion? In this analysis, we explore the question using a detailed financial model.    Lex Sokolin, a CoinDesk columnist, is Global Fintech co-head at ConsenSys, a Brooklyn, N.Y.-based blockchain software company. The following is adapted from his Fintech Blueprint newsletter.    We then consider the valuations and multiples of capital markets protocols in decentralized finance, now making up over $60 billion in token value. Lastly, we look at Binance’s $1 billion in profits, its $35 billion BNB token and the activities on Binance Smart Chain. This context helps us understand and evaluate how Coinbase comes to market.    Valuing Coinbase    Last time we talked about Coinbase, we gave it a $15 billion valuation. Maybe it was right at the time, but it was fairly wrong given where things are going now. Today’s Coinbase private valuation is floating between $50 billion and $100 billion in the private secondary markets on Nasdaq. That distance made us revisit the financial model for the company with a February update.      The core drivers that changed are as follows:    The last quarter generated $600 million in revenue, which was as much as the first three quarters combined. So we think 2020 year-end was somewhere around the $1.2+ billion range, and the company is annualizing at over $2 billion.  The price of the core crypto assets doubled, doubled and then doubled again. When BTC is at $60,000 and ETH is at $2,000, Coinbase has a symmetrically large increase in its core business. Reminder that in July, BTC was at $7,000. As a result, cumulative trading volumes jumped to $450 billion from $200 billion.  Institutional money has arrived, and the world’s richest man is Elon Musk and not Warren Buffett. Elon has chipped in $1.5 billion and Coinbase’s institutional custody and prime brokerage business has become 50% of their $90 billion under custody.    In 2017, Coinbase nearly hit $1 billion in revenue. The year before, it did between $10 million and $20 million.      Working backwards through the numbers, we see this was in large part driven by asset appreciation and massive surge in retail interest. How do you predict when that happens again? You can literally be working in the heart of the crypto ecosystem and not see it coming three months before it actually materializes.      We can project out continued moderately-aggressive growth in the crypto asset class, and see large increases in the Coinbase revenue base. While a lot of that will come from retail, we expect an increasing amount of prime brokerage business to start yielding results on the institutional side – perhaps generating $250-$500 million in fees. While the assets under custody are roughly the same, according to a year-end report from the company, the pricing on the two differs substantially.      See also: Coinbase, Readying for Public Listing, Gets $77B Valuation From Nasdaq Private Market      Here is a simple print of the valuation history. We also project forward a 2021 valuation based on revenue.      What can we learn?      Coinbase has floated around between a 20x and 50x multiple depending on the year of operation. In 2021, we expect that multiple to be towards the higher end of the spectrum. And yet, how much and how fast can we expect companies with a $100 billion valuation to grow? This is a conundrum.      Second, we see revenue per user at about $50 for 43 million users. This is a fantastic feat. The ability to continue to extract these numbers depends on market volatility, of course. Last, we note that the implied $2,600 valuation per user metric feels quite high relative to the rest of the neo-banks, which sit at $500 to $1,000 per user. But who knows? We quote again from the ARK Invest ""Big Ideas"" report that a digital wallet user, or alternately a fintech bundle user, could be a $20,000 annual revenue customer.      If you want to play with the numbers, grab the model here.      We are excited about seeing Coinbase’s real economics because everything here is just a guesstimate. The direct listing will create a wave of crypto entrepreneurs and investors that will continue driving interest and creativity in the space.    DeFi as a $60 billion sector    Decentralized finance (DeFi) is not without its metrics. For the data-curious, you can figure out the amount of total value locked (TVL, collateralized assets), revenue from particular protocols, the directions of various cash flows and other financial metrics.      DeFi protocols including Uniswap, Sushiswap, Balancer and Curve are most like Coinbase in providing trading and market making functionalities directly on the Ethereum mainnet. The Ethereum computer executes the code that competes with Coinbase. We could also, for argument, look at Compound, Aave or Cream as the prime brokerage competitors. Those protocols provide leverage and transform various risks into other risks. But this is a smaller part of Coinbase’s business, so let’s put it aside for the moment.      Uniswap is running at $1.2 billion in annualized revenue, and at the time of making the chart was worth $6 billion in token market value. It is now at $7 billion. This is the problem of doing analysis in crypto using Excel. Uniswap’s volume of $100 billion runs a bit behind Coinbase’s $450 billion. But, honestly, that is a difference of timing and not an order of magnitude. If we were Coinbase, we would be a bit bothered.      See also: Lex Sokolin - The Revolution You’ve Been Awaiting: Fintech + DeFi      Note also the difference in valuation – $100 billion vs <$10 billion. This is, we think, in part a discount on what UNI, the protocol governance token, really represents. If it were a security for shareholders, it should absolutely be worth 50x rather than 5x on revenue. But that ownership is held by VCs after an $11 million fund raise, so time will tell on how the value accrual will flow between the equity and the token. Notably, the prime brokerage/leverage markets protocols do trade at higher multiples – looking more like the 50x discussed.      One way to understand this is to say that expected growth is higher in the laggards than in the leaders. Another way to look at it is to say that revenue generation actually doesn’t matter, and it is engagement and usage that does. The simple measure of that is TVL, on the basis of which all DeFi protocols are more similarly priced, and float between 1x to 3x.      All that said, DeFi is now in the same league as Coinbase, with the various protocol tokens adding up to $60 billion.    Binance at $200 billion    If Coinbase is some sort of crypto Superman, Binance is the shadowy Batman. Or perhaps Coinbase is Wonder Woman to Binance’s Catwoman. (You get the idea. We’re nerds.)      Binance is deeply impressive on multiple fronts. As a centralized exchange founded in 2017, it has survived multiple in attempts to shut down bitcoin trading in China. It is multi-jurisdictional, holding redundant licenses across the long tail of small countries willing to grant it the equivalent of economic asylum. It is also aggressively inclusive, having a reputation for the widest selection of assets and a lightning quick propensity for execution.      On top of that, it launched an exchange token that mattered – BNB. And it did the launch when initial coin offerings were starting to sour. The token made promises of future features, and functioned largely like a referral mechanism for affiliate trading fees. This catapulted Binance into volume that would make Coinbase blush. Here are the key 2020 numbers.      See also: Lex Sokolin - Robinhood Can’t Democratize Finance Using Old Tools      Look, $3.88 billion in average daily trading volume times 365 days in a crypto year is $1.4 trillion in volume. Naively, that’s about three to five times where Coinbase is today. With the lowest trading fees of a 0.1% spread, we are looking at $1.5 billion to $5 billion in revenue for the company. That ignores all the revenue from its derivatives footprint and a variety of other revenue sources; 2020 profits will be in the $800 million to $1 billion range.      Now, just because Binance is crushing it, doesn’t mean Coinbase isn’t crushing it. Everything is relative, but the space does grow better together. For example, Binance will not be able to be America’s institutional crypto chassis, and that adoption is a big driver of capital appreciation. And yet, even with a regulatory risk valuation haircut, a 40x multiple on $5 billion in revenue gets you a $200 billion company in 2020. Who knows what the next year will bring? But we can see Binance becoming an Ant Financial-sized company given its current growth path.      Lastly, Binance is now assimilating the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem through a variety of open source copying/forks. It launched the Binance Smart Chain in 2020 to be compatible with Ethereum. However, the chain is widely criticized for being centrally managed and therefore not performing the core function of blockchain, i.e., censorship resistance and decentralization. It is more akin to a private cloud.      Just because Russian Facebook clone VKontakte looked like Facebook at first hasn’t prevented it from creating $40 billion in annual revenue.      Similarly, Binance is capturing an audience of people for whom true decentralization is not currently a meaningful goal. Now that will very likely change over time if sovereigns attempt to seize more of Binance’s assets, including those on the chain it controls (think Mt. Gox) or if Binance compromises its reputation. As decentralized solutions become faster and cheaper, more controlled environments will also appear less attractive.      At this particular moment, regular people have not fully grokked the core importance of the digital scarcity that Ethereum manufactures and provides. As a result of this market environment, the BNB token currently stands at a $38 billion market capitalization, or four times revenue like UNI and SUSHI.    Takeaway    Absolutely none of the above is an investment recommendation or specific financial advice.      Rather, we want to help you get oriented to the market valuations of the different types of players that touch crypto capital markets. Because, let’s face it, a massive amount of emotion and attention will be spent on taking these companies public and finding new ways to regulate them and turn them into banks. The windfalls from these activities will continue to grow and expand the crypto fractal.

42433673,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP0TRh,1614087602,"Ethereum Trading Bot Strategy ‘Extracted’ $107M in 30 Days, Research Suggests","Trading bots preying on perceived flaws in Ethereum’s infrastructure have “extracted” at least $107 million in the past 30 days, according to new research.      Popularly referred to as Miner Extracted Value (MEV), the arbitrage strategy sees bots identify and target trades waiting in Ethereum mempools. The bots can use a few observed techniques to profit from the targeted trade. For one, a bot will find a profitable trade waiting in the mempool. Then it will copy that trade and up the gas price for its transaction. That way, a miner will package its copy trade before the original can go through.      “After scraping the Ethereum blockchain starting from the first block of 2020 (9193266), we’ve found a total of at least $314M worth (~540k ETH) of Extracted MEV since Jan 1st 2020,” a Medium article from research group Flashbots states.    Read more: New Research Sheds Light on the Front-Running Bots in Ethereum’s Dark Forest    The technique netted at least $57 million or 47,600 ETH in January alone and $107 million in the past thirty days, the Flashbots data shows. For example, this trade Flashbots points to continuously re-bid on a trade so as to protect it from trading bots that noticed it. The original trader was successful, but at the cost of the lurking bots wasting gas on a failed transaction and increasing congestion on the Ethereum blockchain.      One point of clarification about the data, Flashbots Alex Obadia told CoinDesk after publication of this article, is that organizing the numbers correctly remains difficult – it's more art than science.      ""The value we displayed is not from mempool snipers only,"" Obadia said. ""But anyone looking to perform liquidations or arbitrage, it is hard to identify whether an arbitrage trade was seized by a sender that found it in the mempool vs just found the price inefficiency and fired the trade.""    Trading bots create 'negative externalities' for Ethereum    That second point is more important than a first look may convey. Failed transactions generally increase the average transaction cost on-chain – a sore spot for Ethereum users who have suffered under $20-$30 average transaction fees – in addition to “bloating” the Ethereum by leaving traces of the failed transaction on the blockchain’s state. In other words, MEV creates negative externalities for Ethereum (or any smart contract blockchain).      It’s important to note that MEV is not always performed by miners but mainly by trading bots often run by market-making firms. In fact, there’s little evidence to suggest Ethereum miners have employed MEV techniques to date. Some Ethereum mining pools have even built custom networks to deter front running – a form of MEV - such as SparkPool’s Taichi Network.      Flashbots’ dataset is only a rough estimate of MEV, the research group warned, as identifying arbitrage bots requires active on-chain management. Flashbots said the group continues to update its methodology to better reflect real MEV values.

42433667,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP0TDh,1614086581,Tether Deal With New York State Brings Quick Reversal of Crypto-Market Sell-Off,"Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies recovered partially from their biggest sell-off in a month after the New York state Attorney General's office announced a settlement of a dispute involving the stablecoin tether (USDT) that had rattled market confidence in recent weeks.      Prices for bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market value, jumped to $49,000 after the announcement, having hit lows below $45,000 earlier Tuesday. As recently as Sunday, bitcoin had pushed to a new record high above $58,000.      ""After 2.5 years and 2.5M pages of info shared, we admit to no wrongdoing and will pay US$18.5M to resolve this matter,"" Bitfinex tweeted, adding that no finding states that Tether ever issued [the stablecoin] without backing or to impact crypto prices.      According to trader and analyst Alex Kruger, the settlement news is bullish for bitcoin, decentralized finance (DeFi) and Bitfinex's LEO token.      Analysts at JPMorgan warned last week that a sudden loss of confidence in tether – a stablecoin widely used to fund cryptocurrency purchases – would pose risk to the crypto market stability.      In April 2019, the New York prosecutors had accused Bitfinex of using Tether's funds to cover up the loss of $850 million in customer and corporate funds held by a payment processor.      Earlier Tuesday, bitcoin price had slumped to a 12-day low on Tuesday, extending Monday’s double-digit fall from record highs.      Despite bitcoin's increasing use by big investors as a hedge against inflation, many analysts in both crypto markets and on Wall Street say the cryptocurrency still trades like a risky asset, so it's vulnerable when the mood in traditional markets darkens.      And that's what happened on Monday, when stock markets came under pressure on Monday and the yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes reached a 10-month high of 1.39%, extending the year-to-date gain to over 35 basis points, or 0.35 percentage point.      The risk aversion likely helped drag bitcoin lower.      According to CNBC, rising yields could signal investor expectations of reflation – an expansion in the level of output of an economy by using either fiscal or monetary policy or both, with a corresponding increase in prices for assets and consumer goods and services. The U.S. Federal Reserve has been trying to reflate the economy since the March 2020 crash and has pumped trillions of dollars into the system to achieve that goal.      Analysts expect Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to tell Congress later Tuesday that the central bank is committed to keeping interest rates low. The U.S. central bank is also likely to continue with its liquidity-boosting bond purchase program, despite a recent rise in inflation expectations and an improving growth outlook. That will likely push bond yields lower and put a floor under both equities and bitcoin.      “The recent spike in yields suppressed some of the risk-on sentiment, which is inevitable so. But I suspect Powell will err to the side of caution and yields will be lower after his semiannual testimony.” Denis Vinokourov, head of research at the London-based prime brokerage Bequant, told CoinDesk. “In turn, [we’re] expecting risk flows to resume and support upside in BTC and with it the rest of the market.”      According to Margaret Yang, a strategist at DailyFX, investors are anticipating a large U.S. fiscal stimulus bill worth $1.9 trillion, which could boost the reflation theme and inflation outlook.",POSITIVE,BTC | USDT,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | USDT,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/02/23/tether-deal-with-new-york-state-brings-quick-reversal-of-crypto-market-sell-off,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5e28ff3f41b2a9c7dd838ea51fde558ed9a7b165-2402x1065.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433677,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP0TZh,1614084771,"NY AG’s $850M Probe of Bitfinex, Tether Ends in an $18.5M Settlement","A closely watched legal case involving Bitfinex and Tether, with major implications for the cryptocurrency industry, has been resolved.      The New York Attorney General’s office (NYAG) has settled with Bitfinex over a 22-month inquiry into whether the cryptocurrency exchange sought to cover up the loss of $850 million in customer and corporate funds held by a payment processor.      The NYAG’s office announced the settlement Tuesday, formally ending the inquiry that kicked off in April 2019. Under the terms of the settlement, Bitfinex and Tether will admit no wrongdoing but will pay $18.5 million and provide quarterly reports describing the composition of Tether’s reserves for the next two years. More significantly, these reports will match information Tether already provided the NYAG about its reserves. The NYAG will bring no charges as part of the settlement.      In a statement, New York Attorney General Letitia James said, ""Bitfinex and Tether recklessly and unlawfully covered up massive financial losses to keep their scheme going and protect their bottom lines. Tether’s claims that its virtual currency was fully backed by U.S. dollars at all times was a lie.""      The settlement may help resolve, one way or another, a question that has long bedeviled the entire $1.6 trillion global cryptocurrency market. By requiring Tether to provide a greater level of transparency than ever about the backing of its USDT stablecoin – a foundational piece of crypto’s plumbing – the arrangement could replace whispers and conjecture with regular data. Depending on the level of detail provided, investors could have better tools to evaluate the claim that the company has been printing unbacked tokens to artificially drive up the price of bitcoin, the market’s bellwether.      According to the settlement, the NYAG claims Bitfinex and Tether held a portion of Tether’s reserves in trust for several months in 2017 and failed to disclose its troubles with Crypto Capital Corp. in a timely manner in its findings of fact. The NYAG also found fault with a blog post Bitfinex published after the inquiry was first announced, where the exchange said the funds held by Crypto Capital have been “seized and safeguarded.”    ‘Resolves allegations'    Charles Michael, a partner at law firm Steptoe & Johnson LLC who represented the companies in the inquiry, said the settlement “resolves allegations about public disclosures” around Tether’s loan to Bitfinex.      ""To the Attorney General's office's credit, after two and a half years of investigation, [its] findings are limited only to the nature and timing of certain disclosures,"" Michael said. ""And contrary to online speculation, there was no finding that Tether ever issued tethers without backing or to manipulate crypto prices.""      However, the settlement said, ""As of Nov. 2, 2018, tethers were again no longer backed 1-to-1 by U.S. dollars in a Tether bank account, because a substantial portion of the backing in the Deltec account had been transferred to Bitfinex to make up for the funds taken by Crypto Capital, while the corresponding funds transferred from Bitfinex’s Crypto Capital account to Tether’s Crypto Capital account were impaired by Crypto Capital’s actions.""      The $18.5 million that the companies are paying as part of the settlement “should be viewed as a measure of our desire to put this matter behind us and focus on our business,” Bitfinex and Tether General Counsel Stuart Hoegner said in a statement.      He said Tether “voluntarily” provided the NYAG with information about Tether’s reserves, and will continue to do so for two years.      “We proposed that as part of the settlement agreement, we would disclose – both to the Attorney General’s Office and to the public – additional information about Tether’s reserves on a quarterly basis,” Hoegner said.      The disclosures will include the breakdown of cash and cash equivalents that are in the reserves. It’s unclear whether this will take the form of attestations or some other type of update, or whether a third-party auditor or law firm will write the reports. The settlement only said the disclosures will ""substantially"" match what the companies provided the NYAG during its investigation. Bitfinex and Tether must also disclose any information about fund transfers between themselves.      “Putting aside the Attorney General’s characterization of these disclosure issues as misrepresentations or violations of any legal obligation, the Attorney General’s Office concluded, in essence, that Bitfinex and Tether could have done better in publicly disclosing these events,” Michael said.    22 months    New York Attorney General Letitia James announced the legal inquiry in the spring of 2019, revealing that Bitfinex had lost access to nearly $1 billion and covered up the losses using funds from its sister firm Tether. Tether, which shares ownership and key executives with the exchange, loaned Bitfinex $550million and extended a line of credit.      The NYAG inquiry secured an injunction to freeze this line of credit, prevent any further fund transfers and force the companies to turn over any documentation about the deal, which both firms objected to in court. A judge ruled in favor of the NYAG, which subsequently won an appeal as well.      Ultimately, the companies turned over more than 2.5 million documents, Hoegner said.      “The loan was made to ensure continuity for Bitfinex’s customers. It has since been repaid early and in full, including interest. At no point did the loan impact customers, or Tether’s ability to process redemptions,” Michael said.      The NYAG inquiry did not lessen demand for USDT, the dollar-pegged stablecoin issued by Tether. Since the case began the value of the dollar-pegged tokens in circulation has grown from $2 billion to over $34 billion, according to Tether’s transparency page.      The price of bitcoin has more recently gone on a tear, rising to a new all-time high over $58,000.      “We are pleased that our customers have shown loyalty and commitment to our businesses over the past two years, while this investigation was ongoing. ... We look forward to both companies continuing to lead the industry and serve our customers,” Hoegner said.    Missing millions    Since the case entered the public sphere, Bitfinex has tried to recover the funds held by Crypto Capital held by law enforcement officials in Portugal, Poland and the U.S. It’s unclear how long it might take for these cases to resolve, given the different jurisdictions and the ongoing cases against Crypto Capital’s operators.      Last year, Bitfinex filed for subpoenas in three different states, seeking to depose banks that may have held funds for the payment processor.      At the time, Hoegner told CoinDesk through a spokesperson that the efforts were “aimed squarely at obtaining further information” about Crypto Capital and its funds. “Bitfinex is the victim of a fraud and is asserting its rights to funds taken by Crypto Capital through legal measures initiated in various countries.”      The exchange has been granted some of these subpoenas. The Bitfinex settlement is among the largest in crypto history. EOS builder Block.one settled with the SEC for $24 million in 2019 on allegations its $4 billion token sale was an unregistered securities offering. Telegram, at the time an aspiring digital currency issuer, also settled with the SEC for $18.5 million after raising $1.2 billion for the TON network, which was ultimately scrapped.

42433662,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP0T1h,1614075673,Fed's Powell Offers Bitcoin Bulls Glimmer of Hope as Price Drops to $45K,"Bitcoin prices slumped to a 12-day low on Tuesday, extending Monday's double-digit fall from record highs.      The biggest cryptocurrency by market value reached as low as $45,047 at 09:10 UTC – the lowest level since Feb. 11 – having dropped from the record high of $58,332 to below $48,000 on Monday, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      Bitcoin looked overbought at record highs and due for correction – more so, as the cryptocurrency's appeal as inflation hedge was somewhat diluted by the recent rise in the inflation-adjusted U.S. treasury yields.      The macro picture, however, might bring the return of bullish pressure, as analysts expect Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to tell Congress later today that the central bank is committed to keeping interest rates low.      The U.S. central bank is also likely to continue with its liquidity-boosting bond purchase program, despite a recent rise in inflation expectations and an improving growth outlook. That will likely push bond yields lower and put a floor under both equities and bitcoin.      ""The recent spike in yields suppressed some of the risk-on sentiment, which is inevitable so. But I suspect Powell will err to the side of caution and yields will be lower after his semiannual testimony."" Denis Vinokourov, head of research at the London-based prime brokerage Bequant, told CoinDesk. ""In turn, [we're] expecting risk flows to resume and support upside in BTC and with it the rest of the market.""      See also: Attention Kraken Shoppers! Ether Was Half Off at $700 During Monday’s Crypto Sale      Stock markets came under pressure on Monday, as the U.S. 10-year bond yield reached a 10-month high of 1.39%, extending the year-to-date gain to over 35 basis points. The risk aversion likely helped drag bitcoin lower. According to CNBC, rising yields could be signaling reflation – an expansion in the level of output of an economy by using either fiscal or monetary policy or both. The Fed has been trying to reflate the economy since the March 2020 crash and has pumped trillions of dollars into the system to achieve that goal.      As such, one might now expect the Fed to raise rates earlier-than-expected. However, Powell made it clear last August that the central bank will hold interest rates low for some time after inflation has risen above its 2% target. Further, according to Margaret Yang, a strategist at DailyFX, investors are anticipating a large U.S. fiscal stimulus bill worth $1.9 trillion, which could boost the reflation theme and inflation outlook.      Put simply, the inflation-boosting stimulus is unlikely to be scaled back anytime soon and bitcoin's long-term bullish case remains intact. At press time, bitcoin is trading near $48,700, representing a 10.3% drop on the day.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/02/23/feds-powell-offers-bitcoin-bulls-glimmer-of-hope-as-price-drops-to-45k,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/41c854d1cad703b69ccc3e34ac189a147fceaeb3-1200x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
