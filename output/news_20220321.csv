Given that it has been trending in its $36-$38k support level before this, traders had taken to placing their trades in anticipation of the cryptocurrency&apos;s next movements. The digital asset had barreled towards $42,000 leaving positive sentiment in its wake but resistance at this point proved devastating for long traders.

Bitcoin which was expected to early break through $42,000 has met more resistance than anticipated.

42375094,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw5ONN,1647901815,First Mover Asia: Why Bitcoin Started the Week Slowly; Ether Rises,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin holds above $41,000, even after hawkish comments from the chair of the U.S. central bank.  Insights: Bitcoin started the week slowly in Asia, and some investors may be placing their bets on DeFi.  Technician's take: Bitcoin's pullbacks could be limited over the short term.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis. And sign up for First Mover,our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $41,242 +0.1%  Ether (ETH): $2,918 +2%  Top Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Algorand ALGO +8.9% Smart Contract Platform EOS EOS +6.8% Smart Contract Platform XRP XRP +4.1% Currency  Top Losers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Ethereum Classic ETC −2.4% Smart Contract Platform Polygon MATIC −1.0% Smart Contract Platform Solana SOL −0.2% Smart Contract Platform  Markets  S&P 500: 4,461 -1.9%  DJIA: 34,552 -0.5%  Nasdaq: 13,838 -0.4%  Gold: $1,935 +0.8%  Ether gains as bitcoin holds  Bitcoin (BTC) stood roughly where it did 24 hours ago, a little over $41,000, after a brief dip below this threshold following hawkish monetary policy comments from U.S. central bank Chair Jerome Powell.  Ether (ETH), the second-largest crypto by market cap after bitcoin, was changing hands at about $2,900, up over 2%. Other major cryptos were mixed. Trading volume was light as investors take stock of fast-moving, global macroeconomic trends. Bitcoin peaked at over $42,000 last week, buoyed by China's commitment to support its flailing real estate and technology sectors.  Major stock indexes retrenched after Powell said in a speech at the National Association for Business Economics annual conference in Washington D.C. that the Federal Reserve might raise interest in 50-basis-point increments to tame inflation, which has been plaguing the U.S. economy, and threatens to worsen amid fall-out from Russia's intensifying attacks on Ukraine. On Monday, Russian forces bombed a mall in the capital city of Kyiv, continuing its target of civilian locations, and U.S. President Joe Biden warned that Russia might launch cyberattacks on major U.S. companies in retaliation for severe economic sanctions.  The price of Brent crude oil, a widely watched measure of the energy market, rose 7% to $112 per barrel. Russia is one of the world's leading suppliers of oil.  Katie Stockton, founder and Managing Partner of Fairlead Strategies, told CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program that the low trading volumes were ""very normal in a sideways trending market.""  ""Think about it as a tug of war between buyers and sellers and a period of indecisiveness,"" she said. ""I think that indecisiveness is reflecting itself in the lighter volumes, the less decisive trendy moves. ""Then it just becomes a question as to whether that consolidation phase reconciles to the upside or the downside.""  She added: ""We do think it will be reconciled to the upside with our short-term bullish bias. We see it as a function of that, and we would expect with any kind of breakout, let's say above $45,000, we would expect volumes to come back into the market.""  Insights  Bitcoin starts slowly in Asia  Bitcoin started the trading week in Asia slowly, spending most of the day hovering around the $41,000 point, according to data from CoinDesk Indices.  But that’s bitcoin’s problem. But Layer 1 protocols like Avalanche rose 32% last week, while liquidity protocol Aave hit 34% in weekly gains and Ethereum pushed through 15% on the week.  Data from Glassnode reflects this.  The number of active addresses on the network are at a monthly low while long-term HODLers are at a yearly high. Likely there’s a lot of bitcoin parked to get liquidity on better-performing assets.  Interest rates on bitcoin margin loans – used to trade the cryptocurrency on exchanges with extra leverage – are effectively flat, indicating an oversupply in the market. Bitfinex isn’t currently charging a fee for the loans, and Poloniex charges only 0.4%.  And where is all this bitcoin going? Likely into decentralized finance (DeFi). The Bored Ape Yacht Club-linked ApeCoin (APE) seemed to be the most exciting new thing on the blockchain, jumping over 10% during the day. As CoinDesk reported, APE covered calls were hitting a 42% projected annualized yield.  There are also staking possibilities. With the launch of Eth 2.0 soon to occur, traders are becoming increasingly bullish on ether with projected yields hitting 10% to 15%.  But remember, that all this isn’t necessarily a bad thing for bitcoin. Bitcoin’s volatility index was at a monthly low and approaching a yearly low as the market stabilized after the Fed raised rates as expected. All this helps the narrative of bitcoin as a store of value, not something that reacts violently to market gyrations as we saw last year. More bitcoin held with confidence for the long term is more liquidity available for DeFi.  Technician's take  Bitcoin Fades From Resistance; Support at $37K-$40K  Bitcoin (BTC) is consolidating around the $41,000 price level amid declining trading volume.  The cryptocurrency is roughly flat over the past 24 hours, and pullbacks could be limited toward a strong support base at $37,000.  Further, the relative strength index (RSI) on the four-hour chart is declining from overbought levels, which reflects a loss of upside momentum. On the daily chart, the RSI is holding above the 50 neutral mark, which means buyers could remain active at lower support levels.  On the weekly chart, technical indicators are improving, similar to what occurred in August 2021, which preceded a 60% price rally. This time, however, there is negative momentum on the monthly chart, which typically precedes rangebound or negative price action. That means upside could be limited around the $46,000-$50,000 resistance zone.

42375047,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw5O5l,1647901518,Crypto Exchange Blockchain.com Acquires Altonomy’s OTC Desk,"Crypto exchange Blockchain.com has acquired Altonomy’s over-the-counter (OTC) trading desk.  Blockchain.com told CoinDesk it has already integrated Altonomy’s “core systems” with the firm’s existing OTC trading capabilities, according to Vice President of Markets Dan Bookstaber. Twenty-six Altonomy employees have also moved over, he said.  He declined to disclose the terms of the deal but said only Altonomy’s OTC desk was transferred. A since-deleted March 10 notice from Global Legal Chronicle described a cash-and-stock sale advised by the law firm Allen & Overy.  Altonomy is a digital assets investments, market making and OTC firm founded in 2018, according to Pitchbook. Specializing in altcoins like the recently debuted ApeCoin (APE), its OTC desk pairs buyers and sellers of hard-to-move assets. Bookstaber said Altonomy works with over 1,000 clients.  The deal significantly expands Blockchain.com’s presence in crypto OTC trading. Altonomy handled over $16 billion in spot market OTC trades last year; by comparison, Blockchain.com saw $10 billion in total activity across all its institutional crypto business lines, OTC included. A Blockchain.com representative declined to provide the breakdown.  Altonomy’s client network, its Asia footprint and the altcoin focus was what clinched the deal, Bookstaber said. Blockchain.com already had “one of the larger desks” for OTC options – which are more complex than spot trades – and Altonomy’s business bolsters its altcoin trading capacity.  “Their technology is very good at finding liquidity and managing execution on coins that are much lower liquidity,” Bookstaber said. “They have quite a bit of network within the ecosystem of people who are building these clients, far before they ever get listed.”  The deal comes as big banks are only just waking up to complex crypto trades. On Monday, Goldman Sachs (GS) announced it had “facilitated and executed” its first OTC crypto options trade in conjunction with Galaxy Digital. That product was a non-deliverable bitcoin (BTC) option.  Read more: Goldman Sachs Conducts First Over-the-Counter Crypto Trade With Galaxy  Trading altcoins via OTC is a different beast entirely. APE and other novel altcoins don’t have well-established and highly liquid markets as bitcoin does – especially in their trading debut.  “The dynamics of a primary listing are just very different from a coin that’s traded for a while on a lot of exchanges,” Bookstaber said.  Ricky Li, co-founder of Altonomy, who heads its North America division, said the company’s OTC trading “paid well for us” but it was time to make an exit. Clients wanted borrowing and lending services that Altonomy had little interest in building.  He’s now turning Altonomy toward venture investments and proprietary trading.  “[Now] we just get to manage our own money and trade on the market,” Li said.",POSITIVE,BTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/03/21/crypto-exchange-blockchaincom-acquires-altonomys-otc-desk,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bc509686f6a7db29088532699492df6df85164e4-1799x1285.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The company also received a $100 million investment from FTX Ventures, the exchange’s $2 billion venture capital fund.  FTX US and Dave are currently exploring how to introduce digital asset payments onto Dave’s platform. FTX US will serve as the exclusive partner for any crypto offerings.  The $100 million investment from FTX Ventures was through a convertible note, a type of short-term debt.  “We consistently look to align with companies that share our vision, have unique and disruptive business models, and can help drive widespread adoption of digital assets. Dave is a great fit as they check all three boxes,” said FTX US President Brett Harrison in a press release.  Dave, which counts billionaire Mark Cuban among its backers, went public in January through a $4 billion merger with special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) VPC Impact Acquisition Holdings III.  Earlier this year, FTX US raised $400 million at an $8 billion valuation in one of the crypto industry’s largest Series A rounds.

42434968,tCVH4TQcT7YFJO3hckPQH5,1647895597,Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Investing in Crypto Fund: Sources,"Bridgewater Associates is preparing to back its first crypto fund.  The world’s largest hedge fund is planning to back an external vehicle, two people told CoinDesk. It has no current intention of directly investing in crypto assets itself, one of the sources said.  It’s the clearest signal to date that the world’s largest hedge fund, currently with $150 billion in assets under management (AUM), is taking crypto seriously as an asset class – aside from founder Ray Dalio’s announcement in May 2021 of a personal investment in bitcoin (BTC).  That said, the size of Bridgewater’s investment is minuscule compared to its total AUM, one of the sources said, and other prominent crypto investors are in talks to invest in the fund.  When reached last month by CoinDesk, a Bridgewater spokesperson said the firm did not currently have plans to invest in cryptocurrencies – despite four people saying the hedge fund giant was due to enter the space by mid-2022.  “While we won’t comment on our positions, we can say Bridgewater continues to actively research crypto but is not currently planning on investing in crypto,” a Bridgewater representative told CoinDesk via email on Feb. 22. Bridgewater issued a report on institutional crypto trends in January.  The spokesperson did not provide a response to a request for comment sent Monday.  Connecticut-based Bridgewater was founded in 1975 by Harvard Business School graduate Dalio from his Manhattan apartment. Something of a talismanic figure in the world of investing, he has been public about personally holding bitcoin, referring to it as “one hell of an invention.”  Bridgewater is plotting a similar path to London-based hedge fund Marshall Wace, which was reported to be standing up a crypto fund, along the same lines as Point72 and Brevan Howard.  Some sources were light on details about the tie-up but the people CoinDesk spoke with agreed on a rough timeline for Bridgewater’s crypto debut.  “Bridgewater is in a first-half plan this year,” said one of the people in February. “They’re planning on having a small slug of their fund deployed directly into digital assets.”  Another person familiar with the hedge fund’s crypto trading plans said: “Bridgewater is looking to get involved. They are doing serious diligence: liquidity, service providers and whatnot.”  Zack Seward contributed reporting.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | TRADING | RESEARCH,"Danny Nelson, Ian Allison",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/03/21/ray-dalios-bridgewater-investing-in-crypto-fund-sources,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/66cd2470ebcf7907d01390a0237f00f003942dbb-4000x2667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Revenue in the quarter rose to $19.6 million from $10.9 million in the third quarter, according to a statement on Monday. Mawson saw a record year for revenue in 2021, with the figure rising nearly tenfold to $43.9 million from the previous year.  Gross profit came in at $16 million, compared with $8.4 million in the third quarter, while non-GAAP Ebtida (earnings before taxes, interest, depreciation and amortization) rose to $10 million in the fourth quarter from $3.3 million in the third quarter.  The miner now expects its hashrate to reach 5.5 exahash per second (EH/s) by early next year. That is 10% higher than the previous target of 5 EH/s the company forecasted in March.  Mawson’s stock fell almost 13% during Monday’s regular trading hours, significantly underperforming its rival mining stocks, but the shares were up about 4% in after-hours trading.

42434976,tCVH4TQcT7YFJO3hckPQYu,1647893708,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Pulls Back After Fed Chair's Comments; Volatility Oversold,"Bitcoin (BTC) dipped below $41,000 on Monday after U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank is prepared to aggressively raise interest rates to tame inflation.  Powell, speaking at the National Association for Business Economics (NABE) annual economic policy conference in Washington, D.C., noted that rates can rise in increments of 50 basis points instead of traditional 25 basis point moves. Tighter monetary policy can lead to slower economic growth, which is typically a headwind for speculative assets. Stocks and cryptocurrencies reacted negatively to Powell's comments during the New York trading day.  Elsewhere, traditional safe havens such as gold and the U.S. dollar rose, while the 10-year Treasury yield climbed above 2.3%, its highest level since 2019.  In crypto markets, most alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) outperformed bitcoin, suggesting that traders are still comfortable with risk, albeit less so relative to last week. BTC was roughly flat over the past 24 hours, compared with a 1% gain in ether (ETH), and a 7% rise in Algorand's ALGO token.  Latest prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $41,187, −0.64%    ●Ether (ETH): $2,918, +1.27%    ●S&P 500 daily close: $4,461, −0.04%    ●Gold: $1,937 per troy ounce, +0.47%    ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 2.31%     Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time. Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Volatility discount  Similar to spot trading volume, implied volatility in the bitcoin options market declined after the Fed's interest rate decision last week. That means the spike in trading activity and choppy price swings were short-lived.  Over the weekend, some traders noticed a large amount of volatility selling, possibly due to an unwinding of option hedges ahead of the Fed decision. As a result, once the event risk (Fed hike) is removed, the volatility curve steepens as traders discount near-term price swings.  Meanwhile, ether's short-term volatility is trading at a discount relative to bitcoin. ""This rarely happens and must have been caused by larger unwinding of Fed-related hedges in ETH versus BTC,"" QCP Capital, a Singapore crypto trading firm, wrote in a Telegram post. Overall, the firm expects an increase in realized volatility from oversold levels.  For option traders, similar discounts can be used to offset volatility exposure between two assets, such as BTC and ETH. Read more here.

Decentralized computation has a supply, a certain amount of demand and a variable price in the cost of gas. Not dinosaur bone gas, but the digital one used to turn on the global network machines.  Lex Sokolin, a CoinDesk columnist, is global fintech co-head at ConsenSys, a Brooklyn, N.Y.-based blockchain software company. The following is adapted from his Fintech Blueprint newsletter.  The other framework is a war over developers to build applications within particular standards regimes. This is the story of Betamax vs. VHS, Apple vs. Windows, iOS vs. Android as well as the Chinese super apps. There exist some number of relevant platforms – let's say more than one but fewer than five – which can provide substitute versions of a particular operating stratum. Those platforms are valuable only if gardened by third-party gardeners, i.e., the developers that make the applications.  Read More: Alts Find It Tough to Beat Layer 1 King Ethereum  If there are many applications, users appear and use them. Users often have the highest willingness to pay. You might think Facebook is free, but remember you paid $1,000 to Apple (AAPL) for the privilege of having a phone. Thereafter, if there are users in your platform, developers value that as a distribution channel in addition to a technology enabler. Such viral loops can create positive network effects, which allow certain equilibria to hold, and others to collapse.  So layer 1s do both – they provide the computational unit as well as the market context in which that computational unit is generated and executed.  So shouldn’t incumbents like Ethereum win this power law game? Well, not if there are ways to bribe and overpower the game. You can see that play out today in the value locked, i.e., collateral, moving around things like Terra, Avalanche, and (still) Binance Smart Chain. In September 2020, Ethereum had 90% of the assets on the market, and today it has about 50%. It is important to understand how and why.  Ecosystem playbook  Here’s an example. Avalanche is launching a $290 million incentive program to grow the applications built on its technology. The protocol’s fully diluted market cap is about $30 billion today. So we are talking about a 1% spend of the market cap on platform growth and recursive customer acquisition.  This is not a unique strategy, of course. Consider Polygon, which launched a $100 million ecosystem fundhttps://blog.polygon.technology/db34f66be3ec to target decentralized finance (DeFi) growth last April. FYI, it worked; there’s now quite a bit of DeFi on Polygon. We could highlight this success story for every layer 1 and foundation out there.  The Solana, FTX, Silicon Valley story is also a good example. For Ethereum, ConsenSys played the role of ecosystem fund in the early days, eventually generating sufficient building and adoption by the community.  Read More: Avalanche, Layer 1 Tokens Soared in November as Ethereum Fees Drove Competition  At a meta level, these funds are a commitment of some amount of the protocol’s token supply for marketing and user acquisition. The users are applications builders, and they bring the consequent retail users thereafter. The recursive motion is that once applications are built and people spend their money on purchasing the protocol’s product, which if you remember is decentralized computation, the value of that computation rises, at least for some time.  It’s the same thing as Microsoft (MSFT) or Apple giving developers grants to be first in a new operating system. Or PayPal (PYPL) and Wells Fargo (WFC) paying new users a $100 reward for opening an account. It’s the same thing as enterprise launching corporate venture arms to capture innovation, and redirect it to that enterprise’s core business, like cloud for AWS or money movement for Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA). It’s also the same thing as liquidity mining rewards for Compound or Uniswap.  The story of infrastructure  Hopefully, we are making obvious points – spend on marketing, grow your adoption against others, build in profitability, use profitability to grow share. We thought Ethereum had this on lock, but the reality is that there’s a lot more risk capital out there wanting to recreate a layer 1 investment return profile. We can imagine $10 billion ecosystem funds doing battle in 2024 for governments, giant tech companies and other industrial whales (large holders).  All this subsidy boils down to the supply and demand of decentralized computation. If we create lots of competing rails that manufacture computation, that capacity may or may not be consumed.  To that end, here’s a useful reminder about what happened to telecoms around the year 2000. Telecom companies were busy laying new capacity for the internet, and competing on generating more bandwidth for usage that hadn’t yet materialized. This physical investment led to oversupply. As demand from builders fell as their startups evaporated, so did the value of the infrastructure.  If we zoom out a bit further, here is the revenue pool of telecoms through and after the Internet pop. Very obviously, the internet is here to stay and the collapse of a particular price bubble holds no real meaning that informs long term fundamental trends.  Being an internet bear forever in 2003 means you've generated a mental block for yourself from understanding the world. And yet, being a bear around revenue and valuation of a particular infrastructure sector is another story – and a rational expectation. Trends like commoditization and Moore’s law overpowered the ability of these companies to hold price, even as demand sky-rocketed.     We are as bullish as anyone out there on Web 3, and won’t regurgitate the core thesis. But the astute observer should watch the layer 1 competition with long-term clarity. A bunch of current growth is powered by marketing and financial incentives, such that well-positioned people can generate a lot of wealth through new token issuance. It’s like IPOing your telecom, and using the stock to fund internet apps on your network. That might get a short-term pop but doesn’t feel like the right, sustainable or sensible equilibrium of fundamental progress. How quaint, indeed.  We also shouldn’t forget that the most valuable Internet companies are not the Ciscos of the world, but those providing media (Google, Facebook) and commerce (Amazon) – the core value prop of Web 1 and Web 2. One should pause to think about the relationship of Apple (hardware access) and AWS (centralized computation) to the whole thing, but that’s for another day. And in Web 3, the “value” is in the $ value.

42394544,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bwBXXH,1647889860,What Is LUNA and UST? A Guide to the Terra Ecosystem,"Editor’s Note:  The following article was written before the complete meltdown of the Terra ecosystem in May, 2022. CoinDesk is maintaining the content for historical purposes but please note that both LUNA (now known as LUNA Classic or LUNC) and UST, the former stablecoin linked to LUNA, have collapsed and do not function as described below.  -Toby Bochan, Managing Editor, Learn  Luna (LUNC) and TerraUSD (UST) are two native tokens of the Terra network, a blockchain-based project developed by Terra Labs in South Korea.  The Terra blockchain is built on Cosmos SDK; a framework that allows developers to create custom blockchains and build their own decentralized applications on top of Terra for various use cases.  The Terra ecosystem contains some natively built projects. These include non-fungible token (NFT) collections, decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms and Web3 applications.  Founded by Do Kwon, a former Stanford University computer science grad who appeared on CoinDesk’s Most influential 2021 list, the Terra ecosystem has experienced tremendous growth recently. The market capitalization of UST grew from $180 million at the start of 2021 to almost $15 billion in March 2022, while LUNA’s price soared by 138-fold.  In addition, the Washington Nationals baseball team announced a five-year sponsorship deal with Terra’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) in February, a deal worth $40 million. It was said the team plans to accept UST as a payment option in the future.  What is LUNA?  According to Terra’s white paper, the founders’ goal was to fulfill what Bitcoin originally set out to be: a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. To achieve that, Terra deploys a system of stablecoins – cryptocurrencies whose value is pegged to different assets such as commodities or fiat currencies.  UST is by far the most popular among them and tracks the price of US dollars whereby one UST token hovers closely around the $1 mark. It achieves its peg to the dollar through the use of the ecosystem’s other token, LUNA.  LUNA plays a vital role in maintaining the price of the Terra stablecoins and reduces market volatility so they remain stable (see below).  Read more: What Is a Stablecoin?  The price of the LUNA token has experienced an astronomical rise in price over the last year. In 2021, LUNA traded at $0.66 and closed the year at $89. Subsequently, it hit its all-time high of $104.58 on March 9, 2022, at a time when most other cryptocurrencies were falling in tandem with global capital markets catalyzed by the Ukrainian invasion crisis.  From relative obscurity, UST has emerged to become the fourth-largest stablecoin behind tether (USDT), USD coin (USDC) and Binance USD (BUSD), surpassing $15 billion in market capitalization.  What is UST and how does it work?  Stablecoins are a specific type of cryptocurrency whose price is pegged, usually to a state-issued fiat currency such as the U.S. dollar. What makes stablecoins in the Terra blockchain different is the method they use to keep the price stable.  Instead of relying on a reserve of assets to maintain their peg, as USDC and USDT do, UST is an algorithmically stabilized coin. This involves using a smart contract-based algorithm to keep the price of TerraUSD (UST) anchored to $1 by burning (permanently destroying) LUNA tokens in order to mint (create) new UST tokens.  So, how does it actually work?  It all has to do with arbitrage. This usually refers to the process of making small profits by finding discrepancies between asset prices on different exchanges. However, in the case of LUNA and UST, it works slightly differently.  In the Terra ecosystem, users can always swap the LUNA token for UST, and vice versa, at a guaranteed price of $1 – regardless of the market price of either token at the time. This is important to note because it means if demand for UST rises and its price rises above $1, LUNA holders can bank a risk-free profit by swapping $1 of LUNA to create one UST token (which due to a rise in demand in this example, is worth more than $1).  During the swapping process, a percentage of LUNA is burned (permanently removed from circulation) and the remainder is deposited into a community treasury. Funds in the treasury are then used to invest in applications and services that expand the utility of the Terra ecosystem.  Burning a percentage of LUNA tokens reduces the number of overall tokens left in circulation, making them more scarce and, therefore, more valuable. By minting more UST tokens, it has the effect of diluting the existing tokens in circulation and bringing the overall price back down to its $1 level.  Similarly, if demand is low for UST and the price falls below $1, UST holders can exchange their UST tokens at a ratio of 1:1 for LUNA – which is worth more because of their scarcity and so the user can bank another risk-free profit.  Read more: Crypto Arbitrage Trading: How to Make Low-Risk Gains  While UST remains the most used stablecoin in the ecosystem, there is a range of other stablecoins available pegged to various fiat currencies such as:  TerraCNY (Chinese yuan)  TerraEUR (euro)  TerraBGP (British pound)  TerraJPY (Japanese yen)  TerraKWR (South Korean kwon)  TerraSDR (the International Monetary Fund)  The International Monetary Fund’s SDR is an outlier among them because the everyday user does not have access to use or purchase anything with it. It’s a special unit of account used as an international reserve asset, calculated by a basket of various fiat currencies belonging to the world’s largest economies.  Terra uses TerraSDR to denominate all of its transaction fees, rewards and stimulus grants on the blockchain to minimize price volatility among the different state-issued currencies. After all, a basket of currencies diversifies risk and so is less prone to wild swings than a single currency – something that’s useful when it comes to determining stable fee rates and rewards.  How Terra works  The Terra smart contract platform was built on the Cosmos SDK, which is known for its interoperability between chains to communicate with each other. Terra also has bridges to other blockchains such Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Harmony and Osmosis – allowing for the seamless transfer of data and tokens between non-native ecosystems.  Terra uses the Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus protocol known as “Tendermint,” where token holders can delegate their funds to certified validators – individuals or groups of people responsible for proposing new blocks – to secure and add new transactions to the blockchain.  It works in a similar way to a House of Representatives or Parliament in politics. LUNA token holders (like citizens) can delegate their coins to validators (the representatives), whereby the more coins that are delegated to them (votes in an election), the more power they have to propose new blocks of transactions, vote on their validity to earn rewards and also play a part in the governance of the blockchain.  Validators are responsible for running the Terra network with a program called full node, which validates the transactions and blocks of the blockchain. The software they use for it is Terra Core, and full node validators must run the latest version of it without any lags or downtime. They also stabilize the price of Terra stablecoins by arbitraging any deviation from the peg and vote for proposals to develop the network.  A validator’s voting power is weighted according to the total number of coins delegated to them to stake, including their own coins, meaning those who have the biggest stake pool have a higher chance of adding a new block to the chain in exchange for staking rewards from transaction fees.  LUNA coins can exist in three different status:  Bonded: Coins are staked or delegated to a stake pool. These are locked up to earn rewards and cannot be traded freely.  Unbonded: Coins that are traded freely and not committed to a stake pool.  Unbonding: Coins that have been withdrawn from staking or delegating. It takes 21 day to complete and it cannot be canceled during the waiting period.  Read more: How Do Ethereum Smart Contracts Work?  What you can do with Terra  Terra was created to be a global, user-friendly platform for electronic cash. It first gained traction among South Korean e-commerce platforms because it offered cheaper transaction fees than most credit card companies and payment processors.  Transactions incur a computational fee that’s usually below 1% of the transferred value and goes to the validators as rewards. Users can pay with Terra stablecoins seamlessly and merchants can accept it as a payment method to lower their costs. More recently, people can use Terra for a myriad of additional things beyond payments, including;  Lending  Borrowing  Insurance  Investing  Charitable causes  Here are a few examples of some of the leading applications built on top of the Terra blockchain.  Anchor Protocol  Anchor is a decentralized money market built on the Terra blockchain. It gained fame for its industry-leading 20% annual percentage yield that UST holders can earn if they deposit their tokens on the platform. It works like a regular bank account. Users can take out loans and deposit savings to earn a yield. Yields earned from the borrower's interest payments and the staking rewards of the collateral they deposit to borrow are distributed to stakers.  Chai  Chai is a payment rail of the Terra network that lets users and merchants send and receive UST.  Chai uses the Terra blockchain to cut out the middlemen and offers lower transaction fees to merchants than mainstream payment processors and credit card companies. It also offers a debit card (Chai Card) that allows buyers to accumulate points and can redeem them for outsized rewards with specific merchants. The payment app was launched in June 2019 in South Korea and has millions of users.  Mirror Protocol  The Mirror Protocol is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that allows users to create and trade “mirrored assets,” or mAssets, that “mirror” the price of stocks – including major stocks traded on U.S. exchanges. They work like derivatives that let you track an asset’s value without actually buying the underlying asset.  Other notable applications built on Terra include:  Ozone, a decentralized insurance protocol  Pylon, a savings and payments platform  Valkyrie, an on-chain referral marketing service  Read more: What Is a Dapp? Decentralized Apps Explained  Risks associated with LUNA and UST tokens  Algorithmic stablecoins are a relatively new way of pegging cryptocurrencies to any fiat currency. Thus, they have not stood the test of time yet because we have not seen how they work during major market stress or shocks. A research paper published by the University of Calgary found that algorithmic stablecoins “are inherently fragile” and “are not stable at all but exist in a state of perpetual vulnerability. The Federal Reserve Bank’s research about the stablecoin market pointed out that design flaws might lead to de-pegging, as exemplified by the rocky launch of Fei – an algorithmic stablecoin that temporarily collapsed after its launch in April 2021.  Stablecoins have drawn a lot of scrutiny over whether the issuers have enough collateral to back the price and what assets ensure the value of the coins. Algorithmic stablecoins do not have any collateral by design – the collateral is its governance token that can be minted or burned to stabilize the price. If the design turns out to be broken, the value of the coin can drop without a backstop.  Singapore-based Luna Foundation Guard (LFG), a non-profit organization dedicated to developing the Terra ecosystem, addressed the worries by adding $1 billion in bitcoin as a reserve asset behind the stablecoins.  It is worth flagging that stablecoins, along with decentralized finance, are still mostly unregulated around the world. How nation-states decide to regulate this part of the crypto market and what rules issuers have to comply with also pose risk to the future value of your money invested in LUNA or UST. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, for instance, subpoenaed Terra CEO Do Kwon related to the Mirror Protocol for offering derivatives of stocks such as Apple (AAPL) or Tesla (TSLA). Do Kwon and Terraform Labs are challenging the SEC in court.

42394538,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bwBX2V,1647887512,How to Stake LUNA on the Terra Protocol,"Editor’s Note:  The following article was written before the complete meltdown of the Terra ecosystem in May, 2022. CoinDesk is maintaining the content for historical purposes but please note that both LUNA (now known as LUNA Classic or LUNC) and UST, the former stablecoin linked to LUNA, have collapsed and do not function as described below.  -Toby Bochan, Managing Editor, Learn  Luna is one of the most popular coins for staking and lets users earn passive income by locking up their LUNA tokens.  In March 2022, the success of its platform allowed LUNA to overtake ether – the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain – as the second-most staked asset with $30 billion worth of tokens locked away by holders.  According to data, users can expect around 6-7% annualized interest on their deposits depending on how they participate in the staking process – far greater than any interest rate offered by traditional banks.  How to stake LUNA  Luna uses a delegated proof-of-stake consensus method to run smart contracts and validate transactions on its blockchain.  That means that holders who want to stake LUNA have two options:  Become a validator.  Choose another existing validator to delegate their coins to.  A “validator” is the term used to describe anyone who helps verify and propose new blocks of transaction data. With Luna, a person or group of people are required to run computing equipment of a certain spec virtually nonstop.  In fact, it’s so competitive that only the top 130 validators are granted the right to verify and add new blocks to the Terra blockchain. That rule is specific to the LUNA staking ecosystem and not something commonly seen with other staking assets.  In return for their efforts, validators collect a commission fee from stakers in the network. The top five validators charge a 5-10% commission fee for their work – something that needs to be factored in when calculating delegated staking returns.  Validators can raise funds to stake from other luna holders by delegation. The bigger the fund, which is sometimes referred to as staking pool, the more chance the validator and his group of delegators will propose a block and pocket the reward from the transaction fee.  Staking by delegation is much more accessible for a majority of token holders who are looking to earn interest on their assets. Any LUNA holder can delegate his coins to a validator without needing to comply with the tough validator requirements, and still be able to earn rewards.  A notable risk for anyone who stakes LUNA (regardless of being a validator or delegator) is slashing. If the validator commits a mistake during the consensus process – i.e. misses a vote, suffers a network outage or is offline for long periods of time – he will be penalized. That can amount to losing a small portion of staked funds, including the delegators’ stake, or getting completely excluded from consensus voting, which means that no rewards can be earned.  How to delegate LUNA to a validator  If you want to delegate your LUNA to another person or group of people, an easy option is to use the Terra Station Wallet – the official wallet software for holding Terra assets.  Go to Terra Station.  Click on Connect and install the browser extension or desktop application.  Create a New Wallet by typing a username and password (keep them secure).  Send LUNA tokens from an exchange you purchased them to your Terra Station Wallet.  Once you have the tokens in the wallet, go to the staking tab.  Choose a validator to delegate your tokens and earn yield by staking.  Overview of the staking pools on Terra Station  As already mentioned, delegators can earn an annual yield of more than 6% by staking their LUNA. Be aware, however, that yields may change in the future. If you decide to stop staking and withdraw your tokens, there is a 21-day waiting period until you will receive them. A full guide on how to start staking LUNA can be found here.  To choose a validator delegate to stake LUNA, you should consider the following points:  The size of the stake pool: If the validator’s fund size falls below 130th place in the rankings, all of his privileges will be stripped.  Amount of self-bonded tokens: Coins that the validator owns and pledged to stake as his skin in the game.  Amount of delegated tokens: How popular is the validator among others and how many coins are committed to the fund.  Commission fee: How much the validator deducts from the staking rewards for running the node before distributing those rewards among delegators.  Track record of the validator: How long the person has been running the node as well as his votes on proposals, history of outages, compromises and attacks.  Read more: 6 Top Cryptocurrencies You Can Stake: An In-Depth Guide  How to become a validator on Terra  The barrier to becoming a Terra network validator is pretty high compared with the vast majority of other staking-based cryptocurrencies. Only the validators with the 130 biggest LUNA stakes are allowed to participate in the validation process.  Here you can find a full list of the 130 active validators.  As of this writing in March 2022, the threshold to become a validator is close to 152,000 luna staked, worth about $13 million.  A validator’s total stake is the sum of the “self-bonded” tokens – the tokens owned and staked by the validator – and the tokens delegated to the stake pool. If a validator’s stake falls below the threshold, meaning he is outside of the 130th largest stake, he loses its status as a validator, meaning that he cannot participate actively in securing the network and won’t earn rewards. Any tokens in their fund then become “unbonded” – meaning they are free to be staked elsewhere.  In practice, any participant in the Terra network can apply to be a validator. A candidate can submit an application by creating a validator profile following the steps detailed on the official Terra website.  The candidate registers by sending a ""create-validator"" transaction to the blockchain with a series of data including:  PubKey, which is the account associated with the private key of the validator.  Address to identify your validator publicly.  Moniker (name) of the validator.  Website and description of the validator.  Initial commission rate charged to delegators.  Maximum commission the validator will be allowed to charge.  Maximum commission change rate the validator can increase the commission daily.  Minimum self-bond amount, coins owned by the validator and committed to the staking pool.  The initial amount of coins the validator self-bonds.  Once that's done, the validator can lock up his own coins and start to accept delegations to stake.  After registration, the validator will be “unbonded,” meaning that he doesn't actively participate in the consensus and earn rewards. To gain the “bonded” validator state, he has to have one of the 130 largest stake pools.  Read more: Ethereum Nodes and Clients: A Complete Guide  Where can you buy LUNA?  As LUNA has attracted investors' attention, more and more exchanges started to list the token in their offerings.

42411482,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glONvu,1647886329,"The Future of Ethereum Sucks, and I Feel Fine","Technology ecosystems tend to take off when the technology matches the use case and solves a really important problem. This works even if the technology itself can be a little clumsy. Yet sometimes new use cases will arise based on the fact that the platform is widely available, even if it’s not an ideal fit. We can expect the same for Ethereum.  We have an everyday example of this already. The internet is a fantastic network for sending data. It’s terrible, however, at getting it there in a very timely manner. Packets go off in all different directions and are likely to arrive out of order. The system is efficient, but it wasn’t necessarily designed to be fast, and it wasn’t designed to be able to discriminate between time-sensitive video content and text-only emails.  Paul Brody is EY's global blockchain leader and a CoinDesk columnist.  Early internet users and architects would have been horrified at the idea of real-time voice and video conferencing on the network. They would rightly have said the network isn’t designed for that and probably encouraged you instead to use a circuit-switched system that guaranteed bandwidth and availability. We experience the shortcomings of the internet’s traffic model nearly every day, as users drop in and out, audio breaks up and video stalls. Thanks to Murphy’s Law, this will only happen when you’ve said something especially brilliant or funny, however.  How then did we all end up spending eight hours a day on video calls during the pandemic on the internet? The answer is that it’s the network we have in our pockets and in our homes every day, and it’s connected to general purpose programmable devices, like computers and smartphones. And while it’s far from optimal, it’s much easier than fixing the legacy circuit-switched telephone network to support video calls and streaming media.  I believe this pattern will recur with Ethereum. Millions of users now have blockchain wallets and accounts. They have stablecoins and cryptocurrencies and access to digital contracts. They represent a ready market of investors and buyers with a demonstrated willingness to try new things. And that may, in turn, become more important than using blockchain technology for use cases that are ideally decentralized.  The result is likely to be quite a few new use cases that could be better executed in centralized ecosystems but that will instead be launched on public, decentralized blockchains. I’m already seeing some of these come up during conversations with clients. It is already happening in some respects, as many people are buying non-fungible tokens (NFTs) only to discover they don’t own anything other than the NFT. “Owning” this item doesn’t mean they truly own the copyright, any more than I “own” the music I have “purchased” online.  Two predictions  While I cannot predict how use cases are likely to evolve, I can make two predictions about how I think the future of Ethereum may well shake out. First, I used to rigorously assess use cases proposed by clients against how well they fit with decentralized technology. If there wasn’t a fit, I tended to push back against deploying to the blockchain. By almost any standard, it’s faster and cheaper to build a centralized application than a decentralized one. No longer. Now, the value proposition is instead market access to hundreds of billions of cutting-edge investment dollars.  Secondly, as use cases evolve that stretch Ethereum beyond its core functions, specialized tools and systems will evolve to support those use cases, just as it did on the internet. Content delivery networks, advertising networks and multi-protocol-label-switching (MPLS) routers have all arrived to help the internet deal with the flood of voice and video. Similar analogues will arise in the blockchain ecosystem. We’re already seeing a flood of startups designed to help build decentralized autonomous entities (DAOs) and NFT ecosystems. Many more are on the way.  For the idealists (including me) that populate the Ethereum ecosystem, some of this is going to be painful. The truth about the internet is that it’s the most successful network in history, but it’s far from the early ideal. It’s now sliced up with restrictions, national barriers, insecure security systems and “privacy” technologies that leak sensitive personal information. Compared to the global barrierless decentralized network we started with, it kinda sucks, but it's also impossible to go back.  Software is eating the world. Ethereum is going to eat the global economy. I believe it will make us all bigger and better stakeholders in our shared future. The price of that growth, however, is going to be a slow drift away from the decentralized, fully open ideal we started with. The benefits will outweigh those costs, but with careful design choices, the damage of that drift can be limited.

42390176,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bX2lAN,1647881049,"Crypto Mining, the Energy Crisis and the End of ESG","The tedious and enervating debate regarding bitcoin’s (BTC) purported environmental costs effectively ended last month, with little fanfare. The cause was not the revelation that miners are the most benevolent industrial consumers possible, providing a valuable source of flexible load that will accelerate a green energy transition. Nor was it that the bitcoin mining industry is more transparent, more sustainable, better understood, and more accountable than it has ever been.  CoinDesk columnist Nic Carter is partner at Castle Island Ventures, a public blockchain-focused venture fund based in Cambridge, Mass. He is also the co-founder of Coin Metrics, a blockchain analytics startup. This post is part of Mining Week.  No – the energy “debate” became irrelevant because the world reminded us, sharply and brusquely, that environmentalist fever dreams are completely out of step with reality. Empowered by the European energy serfdom resulting from the Greens gaining power (in Germany and elsewhere), Russia invaded Ukraine. Energy prices, already elevated, skyrocketed. The new commodities crisis is casting the globalized international system into doubt, setting off an every-nation-for-itself stampede. The world was forced to remember that energy sovereignty matters – and the anti-humanist fantasies of the Greens stand directly in opposition to that.  Having politically savaged the oil and gas sector, the Biden administration has now resorted to obsequiously asking the Iranian, Venezuelan and Saudi regimes for accommodation. Anything to avoid admitting the U.S. president made a shocking miscalculation in definancializing our own oil and gas sector and canceling the Keystone Pipeline on day one in office. But even the myopic Biden administration cannot deny reality. Without energy security you have no sovereignty, no industry and ultimately no ability to feed your people. This lesson will be learned in blood if high energy prices persist.  The maniacal focus on “ESG,” or environmental, social and governance, that has characterized western policymaking for decades is being necessarily reconsidered. What will replace it is a more pragmatic approach focused on national security, energy independence in a de-globalizing world, and a more measured and responsible decarbonization. Abandoned are the Green fantasies of power systems subsisting solely on solar, wind and batteries: These ideas have manifestly failed.  Read more: Nic Carter - The Frustrating, Maddening, All-Consuming Bitcoin Energy Debate  Spurning nuclear, Germany attempted such a transition. And the Germans simply ended up increasing their carbon intensity (due to a dependence on load-following conventional generation needed to smooth out intermittent renewables) and becoming completely dependent on Russian gas to boot. These outcomes were completely predictable, yet the anti-humanist Greens insisted on touching the stove to determine if it was hot. Now the house is burning down and with it Europe.  It is evident the United States must reverse course and pursue energy abundance and independence with a maniacal focus. Undoing the anti-progress, neo-Malthusian attitudes that infected the political Left will take work, but it is a necessary transition. The U.S. must once again become an energy exporter, unleashing its bountiful reserves of shale, giving our European allies an alternative to Russian gas. The hounding of the oil and gas sector via the politicization of finance must end, and this industry must be unleashed to push down energy prices. The U.S. should pursue a decarbonized power grid, but one incorporating abundant nuclear, and on a timeline that makes sense.  Miners can help here. Global bitcoin mining uses about 15 gigawatts of power today, around 40% of which is U.S.-based. If the predictions of miners are to be believed, at least 30 GW to 40 GW of expansions are planned in the U.S. over the next two to three years. Many of these installations will be done in direct partnership with energy firms, including the largest renewable asset owners. Adding bitcoin mining as an offtake dramatically improves the economics of new wind and solar installations. Despite what critics say, these partnerships are genuine, and these models work (the critics rarely take “grid firming” into account). The proof is in the pudding, and there will be plenty of pudding made in the coming months and years.  In terms of grid scarcity events, it is well documented that miners represent a unique kind of interruptible load. Virtually all miners engage in voluntary or contractual curtailment when demand outpaces supply and power prices surge. With little fanfare, miners habitually curtail their usage, helping smooth out demand peaks. The growth of this “demand response” or flexible load capacity directly contributes to grid decarbonizationhttps://lancium.com/press/flexible-data-center-whitepaper/, allowing intermittent renewables to penetrate further than they would otherwise. Miners effectively sell insurance to grid operators.  Read more: Nic Carter - The Last Word on Bitcoin's Energy Consumption  As grids incorporate more variable renewables, they will require more active management and operators will need to buy more insurance. The template here is ERCOT, in Texas, already the most renewable electrical grid in the U.S. Texans lead the pack when it comes to procuring these “ancillary services,” which miners are uniquely suited to produce. As the U.S. re-onshores manufacturing and heavy, energy-intensive industry in a deglobalizing world, a capacious grid will be essential. Clean energy campuses built on stranded energy sites by bitcoin miners will become a vital part of our industrial future. Even if bitcoin disappears, these sites will be repurposed for other industries, from clean hydrogen electrolysis to other types of location-agnostic computing.  Recent events also make bitcoin’s utility starkly clear, even as its energy impact rises. In the 1970s, when the U.S. defaulted on its promise to maintain the gold peg and inflation ran rampant as a consequence, the price of gold soared from $35 an ounce to $675, or a factor of nine in real terms. Counterintuitively, the resource costs associated with gold extraction increased when gold lost its official status. The more gold was worth, the greater the bounty available to miners. So production increased dramatically, as did the associated energy and ecological costs.  Does this mean that gold had or has an “ESG problem”? Because gold extraction and refinery maintains a considerable emissions footprint, does this make gold an “ESG-unfriendly” asset to hold, and does it require moral justification on the part of holders? Of course not, no more than any individual relying on any commodity with an instantiated energy cost should feel ashamed of their emissions.  Gold is identical in this respect to steel, concrete, nickel, copper, zinc or any other metal that is costly to produce and produces emissions. Bitcoin, though synthetic, is no different. It is a monetary tool that makes life easier for humans. The externalities of its use should be considered alongside those of every other commodity that makes life worth living on this planet.  Read more: Nic Carter - Bitcoin Mining Is Reshaping the Energy Sector and No One Is Talking About It  Just because you can’t touch and feel it doesn’t make it unreal or an unsound store of value. You can’t touch domain names, or intellectual property or most stocks for that matter, but these clearly hold value. Bitcoin is no more or less deserving of moral opprobrium relative to other commodities simply because it is new or intangible.  The typical response on the Left to this obvious point is that bitcoin and cryptocurrency is useless, and hence all the resources expended to maintain and issue it constitute a waste. But with inflation at 10% in the U.S., interest rates sitting at negative 7%, and wholesale monetary repression underway, the usefulness of hard assets is no longer in doubt. Today, investors are forced to appreciate the difference between liability-impregnated inside money and liability-free outside money. As Bretton Woods II disintegrates, outside money is king.  There is no doubt that censor-resistant, global money offers very tangible usefulness today. The Ukrainian resistance to Russia got a tremendous boost from $50 million in global crypto donations, $12 million of it in bitcoin form. Thanks to bitcoin’s liquidity profile and market access, the Ukrainian government was able to utilize these donations with immediate effect.  Ukraine was also the fourth-highest crypto adopter nation in 2021, according to Chainalysis. Undoubtedly a significant fraction of the millions of refugees fleeing the country will benefit from access to liquid wealth that they can store on their person and cannot be frozen by banks or governments.  Everyday Russians, too, now excluded from global finance through financial institutions employing broad-based sanctions, now find cryptocurrency as their only lifeline. There is no longer a plausible case for bitcoin denialism; the time for that has expired. The empirical reality simply weighs too heavily. Sound, global apolitical money is an absolute necessity for tens if not hundreds of millions of people worldwide – in its current form. It requires no change, development or alteration. Bitcoin works today for anyone who needs it.  Most importantly, the dollar system can no longer plausibly claim to offer sound property rights. Formerly unimpeachable, the FX reserves of all nations holding dollar assets are now on notice. Lest anyone think the U.S. will reserve its financial warfare only for rogue states, recall that it sanctioned the U.K., its ally, as recently as 1956.  India and China, collectively holding $1.4 trillion of U.S. debt, are staunchly agnostic on the matter of the Russian conflict. They will look to further divest their U.S. dollar assets, wary of offending an increasingly erratic U.S. regime. Geopolitics is about interests, not morality. Whether or not you think the seizing of Russia’s reserves was prudent or warranted, it undermines the integrity of the dollar.  It may be that an end to the dollar system was long overdue. If strategists like Luke Gromen are to be believed, ending the post-1971 petrodollar reserve system could restore an American trade surplus and revitalize domestic manufacturing. If that’s true, the U.S. will need a vast, responsibly renewable and high-energy grid to support a modern manufacturing base. So, it’s time to accept reality, abandon neo-Malthusian ideas of de-growth or energy shame and lean into American energy supremacy.  Abandoning Green dreams and accepting the hard realities of physics are vital first steps. Following that, let’s leave these broken ESG ideas, stop the politicization of finance and unleash the bitcoin miners.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | COMMODITY | FIAT | MARKET | MINING,Nic Carter,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/03/21/crypto-mining-the-energy-crisis-and-the-end-of-esg,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/40c1dd0ffc2a49cf00e5f0cf64d105def4c0d2b7-1280x960.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

ADGM's Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) ""is not proposing to establish a formal regulatory framework for NFTs"" at the moment, the paper released Monday said.  According to the draft recommendations, firms that are licensed and regulated by ADGM in services like trading and custody will also be able to offer them for NFTs, said Simon O'Brien, executive director for markets at the FSRA.  ""At this stage, the way we're trying to do it is to gradually bring them into our ecosystem,"" Emmanuel Givanakis, the free zone's CEO, told CoinDesk. The regulator started looking at NFTs at least six months ago, Givanakis said.  For regulated firms that are following the rules, very little will change, O'Brien said. They might establish a new non-regulated entity within ADGM to work with NFTs, which will outsource regulated activities like custody and client onboarding back to the licensed firm, he said.  The paper is open for comment until May 20, and ""quite a number of firms"" have already indicated that they're interested in replying, O'Brien said.  ""NFTs themselves are not financial instruments,"" they're comparable to a piece of art, Givanakis said. ""If there's a derivative built around them, then yes, then they become a financial instrument,"" he said.

42417131,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcSJwT7,1647874268,Quantum Computers vs. Crypto Mining: Separating Facts From Fiction,"Quantum computers are special machines that can perform certain calculations significantly faster than everyday computers – known as “classical computers” – and represent the next frontier in computation technology.  In recent years, there have been growing fears these superior computers could eventually be directed at crunching crypto mining computations required to generate new blocks.  This piece is part of CoinDesk's Mining Week.  If that were to happen, the concern is that those wielding quantum computers could, in theory, gain a significant advantage over every other miner in the blockchain network, threatening the decentralization and security of proof-of-work blockchains like Bitcoin and Litecoin. Not to mention, earning a vast majority of the remaining block rewards.  What is quantum computing?  To understand how quantum computers work, you first need to understand that classical computers – like the one you have at home or use for work – represent all bits of data as being one of two states, either a 0 or a 1. This is known as binary code.  By stringing together 0s and 1s, it becomes possible to run more complex computations and store more complex data. But even with stringing 0s and 1s together, classical computers are still limited in their processing capabilities and can run only one computation at a time.  Quantum computers, on the other hand, can run simultaneous computations thanks to the use of quantum bits, also known as “qubits.” Instead of representing data in two states – either a 0 or 1 – qubits can represent data in three states: 0, 1 or both. That's known as a ""superposition.""  Remember Schrödinger's cat? That’s one of the most popular examples of a quantum superposition, where a cat left in a box can neither be dead nor alive. It’s considered both.  Read More: Why Some Bitcoin Devs Say Lasers Can Cut Mining’s Energy Costs  By providing a higher number of states, quantum computers have the ability to perform exponentially larger computations. But there are a number of significant caveats to this technology, which we shall explore further down.  What threats do quantum computers pose to crypto mining?  A recently published academic paper in AVS Quantum Science entitled “The impact of hardware specifications on reaching quantum advantage in the fault tolerant regime” outlined two key threats posed by quantum computing to crypto mining, specifically bitcoin (BTC) mining, and the wider ecosystem.  Threat to the proof-of-work consensus mechanism.  Threat to the elliptic curve encryption of digital signatures.  The threat of quantum computers to proof-of-work blockchains  The proof-of-work consensus mechanism refers to the special system certain blockchains employ to select honest participants to perform the important role of proposing new blocks of transaction data to be added to the blockchain. Because there is no single authority governing a blockchain, it must rely on an automated system coded into the protocol to filter out dishonest users who might attempt to corrupt the blockchain with invalid transactions.  Quantum computers have the capacity to perform higher calculations than other types of specialized machines, and so the obvious concern is they could dominate the mining-based competition. According to the paper’s authors, however, that threat is considered to be minimal because of the nature of the considerably slower clock cycle time of quantum computers versus application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) miners  “The algorithmic speed-up is unlikely to make up for the considerably slower clock cycle times relative to state of the art classical computing for the foreseeable future,” according to the paper.  But how can quantum computers have slower clock cycle times but process more calculations than classical computers? According to Macauley Coggins, founder of Quantum Computing UK, it has to do with a quantum computer’s ability to process calculations simultaneously:  “The power of quantum computing doesn't lay in that it is faster, i.e., faster clock speeds, but that it can make use of quantum parallelism. That's where every single combination of a problem can be [calculated] in parallel.”  In fact, computer scientists in another academic paper entitled “Vulnerability of blockchain technologies to quantum attacks,” which was published in ScienceDirect, suggested it may take as long as to the year 2028 before quantum computers are sophisticated enough to outcompete current ASIC chip technology and perform a majority attack on a blockchain network. That’s not taking into consideration any future improvements to ASIC chip technology by that time.  “Our own calculations based on current ASIC technology, as well as that of other authors [2,3], put the earliest likely date that this type of attack will be possible at 2028. However, advances in ASIC technology are likely to push back this date much farther,” according to the study in ScienceDirect.  Read more: What Is Cryptojacking? How to Protect Yourself Against Crypto Mining Malware  Cracking public-private key cryptography using quantum computers  Both papers concurred that the largest threat posed by quantum computers to crypto is not to mining but by breaking the ""Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm,"" or ECDSA, which is used by bitcoin and a vast majority of other leading cryptocurrencies.  ECDSA is the cryptographic system used to generate mathematically linked public-private keys – the digital tools needed to send and receive cryptocurrency as well as prove who owns the assets held within a crypto wallet.  Breaking this form of encryption would mean a person could ascertain someone's private key from that person's public key, which is freely broadcasted to the entire network each time that wallet makes a transaction. Accessing a private key is like identifying a person’s password and would give the attacker complete control over any funds held in the wallet address.  “If the same public/private key pair is used to hold the users' bitcoin after the public key becomes public knowledge, then all funds secured by the key pair will be vulnerable. However, it must also be considered that bitcoin wallets tend to not repeatedly use the same key pairs,” according to the paper in AVS Quantum Science.  So how many qubits would it take to break the elliptic curve algorithm? According to the AVS Quantum Science paper, quite a lot:  “... It would require 317 × 106 physical qubits to break the encryption within one hour with a code cycle time of 1 μs. To break it within 10 min with the same code cycle time, it would require 1.9 × 109 physical qubits, whereas to break it within 1 day, it would require only 13 × 106 physical qubits.”  Main problems facing quantum computing technology  While quantum computers are already a thing, the technology is still very much in its infancy.  IBM's quantum processor, dubbed “Eagle,” is considered the world’s most powerful quantum computing system to date – containing 127 qubits. A long way off from the estimated 1.9 billion qubits required to break ECDSA within 10 minutes.  Adding more qubits is by no means as straightforward as it sounds, either. It all comes down to a hugely limiting factor known as “quantum noise.” The term refers to any type of subtle environmental change that can affect the performance of a qubit. In fact, the most minor of vibrations or fluctuations in temperate or electromagnetic waves can cause something known as “decoherence,” rendering qubits unable to perform a single calculation. The problem becomes increasingly more persistent the more qubits are involved.  It’s this sensitivity to external factors that significantly inhibits the progression of quantum computers and means they are unlikely to become a major threat to cryptocurrency mining or to the underlying cryptography that secures transactions until this issue is addressed.  Efforts are being directed toward creating hybridized quantum-classical computers as well as creating software to minimize the disturbance caused by quantum noise. But that doesn’t address another critical issue faced by quantum computers.  Unlike with classical computers, it’s incredibly difficult to remove errors when performing calculations on a quantum computer because of the linear nature of quantum computations. Checking qubits for errors can potentially disrupt their state or superposition, skewing results.  There have been, however, a number of advancements in quantum error correction, namely something called the Bacon-Shor code developed by physicist Christopher Monroe and a number of researchers from the University of Maryland. But again, this type of error correction is estimated to require a quantum computer boasting at least 1,300 qubits – more than 10 times the number of qubits present in IBM’s Eagle processor.  As it stands, while quantum computers may one day possess the ability to severely undermine crypto mining and the integrity of blockchain-based networks, the current technology is far from being sophisticated enough to cause any serious concern.

The crypto bank is well positioned to benefit from the expanding use of stablecoins for payment, commerce, and remittance, following the acquisition of Diem’s assets earlier this year, analysts led by Brandon Berman wrote on Monday.  In its capacity as a regulated financial institution, Silvergate is better prepared to “navigate the complex, and still evolving regulatory environment applicable to the digital currency industry,” the report said.  Bank of America forecasts Silvergate to grow its balance sheet five times faster than the average bank under its coverage over the next three years. The “first mover advantage” has resulted in tremendous client growth, with close to $790 billion transferred over the Silvergate Exchange Network, its global payment platform, the report added.  Increased institutional adoption gives Silvergate a long runway for continued client and earnings growth, it added.  As one of the most interest rate sensitive banks in the U.S., helped by its near-zero cost deposit structure, Silvergate is expected to outperform against a backdrop where the Federal Reserve (Fed) is expected to raise rates around six times this year, the bank’s analysts said.  Volatility in the near term is to be expected, given that the stock is highly correlated to the price of bitcoin (BTC), but as the bank expands its products and service capabilities, the shares should trade more on fundamentals, the note added.

42417130,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcSJwS5,1647870439,Don’t Call It a Comeback: The Unlikely Rise of Home Bitcoin Mining,"Lili used to work at JP Morgan. She once ran a portfolio for ultrahigh net worth clients. She has a good grasp of traditional finance. In 2018, while working at wealth management firm UBS, she pitched the idea of using bitcoin as a hedge against equity markets. “They all laughed at me,” she said.  Meanwhile, she began to buy her own bitcoins. She did more research. And the more she studied the ethos of cryptocurrency, the more she became troubled by owning bitcoin that was KYC, or “know-your-customer,” meaning that onramps like Coinbase would know her identity and personal data.  This article is part of CoinDesk's Mining Week series.  How to get bitcoin that was truly private, or “non-KYC”? Lili tried using bitcoin ATMs, but those charged a 6% premium and were 20 minutes from her home on the East Coast. Then she had a wild idea. Why can’t I just mine my own? She discovered an online tutorial from a guy named Diverter called “Mining for the Streets,” which gave a practical, step-by-step guide on how to set up a rig and also a manifesto on why it makes sense.  “Don’t fall victim to the narrative pushers that would have you believe mining is ‘too hard,’ ’too expensive,’ or ’better left to the big players,’” Diverter writes. “Sounds an awful lot like the same thing bankers and governments tell the masses about fiat money and economics now, doesn't it?”  Read More: Can You Still Mine Bitcoin and Other Crypto From Home?  Suddenly Lili had a plan. “I just need a machine. It’s not that bad.” She found home mining groups on Telegram. Initially she didn’t know whom or what to trust, since most miners on the board were “Nyms” (as in anonymous, like her), but soon she found an ad for a popular (if older) bitcoin miner, called the S9, for only $300. Why not? If she was scammed, in the worst-case scenario she was only out a few hundred bucks.  It took some headaches and a few trips to Home Depot, but soon Lili had a steady stream of non-KYC bitcoin flowing into her wallet. This wasn’t making her rich. But each day she pocketed around $2 to $3, which soon paid back the cost of the miner. (She paid for electricity out of her normal wages.) “As soon as those rewards started coming in, and after I learned how to troubleshoot, I was hooked,” said Lili, who would later evangelize home mining in a Twitter thread. “This is the best way to stack.”  Lili, now the head of Biz Dev at FOUNDATIONdvcs (a provider of privacy-focused crypto storage products), is part of a home mining renaissance. “Home mining is more popular than it’s ever been,” said Zack Voell, a longtime researcher of mining (and one-time CoinDesk reporter), and now an editor at Braiins (firmware used by mining machines). According to Google Trends, the terms “bitcoin mining,” “how to mine bitcoin” and “home bitcoin mining” roared back to life in 2021. Subreddits like r/BitcoinMining are thriving. On Twitter, mining enthusiasts proudly post images of their DIY setups, such as this thread from Braiins showcasing homemade rigs in coolers, rigs plugged into HVAC units and rigs that use 3D-printing to cleverly reduce heat. “We’re seeing a huge resurgence and interest in home mining, particularly from US residents,” said Colin Harper, a researcher for the Luxor mining pool (and yet another former CoinDesk reporter).  In some ways this is jarring. The conventional wisdom has long been that mining is only for the institutions, and you don’t have a chance. Quick primer: Back in 2009, at the dawn of bitcoin’s inception, only Satoshi Nakamoto and a few other cypherpunks “mined” bitcoin on normal central processing unit (CPU) computers, and every 10 minutes someone won 50 bitcoins. It was easy. Then the network grew. Competition stiffened. People quickly realized that the faster your computer, the fatter your payout. Savvy miners upgraded to GPUs, or graphics processing units, the chips used to power video games. Then came the rise of ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits), muscular chips built for the sole purpose of mining bitcoin. GPUs would no longer cut it. Larger mining shops, such as Riot Blockchain (RIOT) and Marathon Digital (MARA), had the capital to purchase entire warehouses of these ASICs. The bigger miners could broker deals for cheaper power, leaving the little guy without a prayer. Game over.  Read more:How Does Bitcoin Mining Work?  Then a few things altered the state of play. When China banned crypto mining in the summer of 2021, the “difficulty” of mining was roughly cut in half, since miners had less competition. “It became a lot easier for the smaller guys,” said Harper. There are now more ways for home miners to get the right equipment. “Before, you can’t just go to Bitmain [the largest manufacturer of miners] and say, ‘I want one.’ … They’re just going to tell you to pound sand.” This changed when companies, such as Luxor and Compass, began selling miners to individuals, lowering the barrier to entry.  And now it’s easier to figure out how to do it. “There are more and more tutorials and YouTube channels focused on home mining,” said Magdalena Gronowska, aka @Crypto_Mags, who has a background in enterprise mining and is now the vice president of business development at Coinkite, a bitcoin wallet startup. Gronowska bought a Bitmain Antminer S9 in 2021, and then, to her delight, realized that she could use the heat emitted by the miner to dry out mushrooms. (Celebrated on Twitter here.) This is another change in the past year: Home miners are harnessing the power of heat.  “As soon as I stopped seeing an ASIC as something that makes bitcoin, and I saw it as a profitable heater, it just completely changed my outlook,” said a miner who goes by the alias of Coin Heated, who has a day job in IT. “I was like, ‘I have to do this. I’ve got to be a part of this.’” He first bought an S9 for $160, and figured that even if it didn’t yield much bitcoin, at least it would help heat his home. It’s a space heater with financial upside. The S9 paid for itself within four months, so he bought more miners, made more custom modifications (like sticking them in fish tanks) and eventually built a clever system that heats his 17,000-gallon swimming pool.  The new bitcoin mining math  Heating swimming pools with bitcoin is a nifty trick, but it still doesn’t answer this fundamental question: How are tiny players now able to compete with the big boys?  To understand the economics, let’s focus on the miner that Lili, Gronowska and Coin Heated all purchased, the S9. It was released in 2016. It looks a bit like a computer from the Gerald Ford administration, the size of a microwave with cords sprouting from its back. These were once the “darling of the mining industry,” said Harper, but now you can get one for around $300. The S9 pumps roughly 14 terahashes per second (TH/s) of power, which was blazing fast in 2016 but a turtle by today’s standards, meaning it has almost no chance of winning the coveted block. The daily odds of the S9 winning a block are around 1 in 100,000; it’s just a lottery ticket.  So how can home miners like Lili make any money from crypto mining? Enter the mining pools. It’s true that she only has a 1 in 100,000 chance of winning a block per day. But that’s not nothing. And when you add this itty-bitty amount of horsepower to a mining pool, such as Slush Pool or Luxor, the group’s total odds increase. All of these add up. “No matter how sh**ty it is, it’s still increasing the pool’s chance of winning the block,” said Harper. So when all of the home miners join forces, that combined power is enough to compete with the industrial players. The pools win rewards. The Slush Pool (made up of both home miners and larger players), for example, now accounts for about 5% of all the Bitcoin network’s power, and it wins roughly 5% of the blocks.  Read More: What are Bitcoin Mining Pools?  Lili’s humble S9 is adding a dollop of power to Slush Pool, so she gets a proportional share of the revenue. This is why she’ll earn $2 to $3 worth of bitcoin every day, even though – absent a miracle – she will never win a block herself. The daily revenue becomes predictable. “Pool setups are dominant for a reason,” said Will Foxley, content director at Compass mining, and co-host of CoinDesk TV’s ""The Hash."" “Almost nobody is mining solo.”  The exact payout structure varies by pool, but generally speaking, while you don’t know precisely how many blocks your pool will win each day (if any), you can get a solid estimate of your income. Your exact profits will fluctuate with the price of bitcoin, the overall “difficulty” of the network (the stiffer the competition, the less your pool wins) and the cost of energy.  While “almost nobody” is mining solo, incredibly, there are at least 2,000 miners who choose to do just that. They’re not part of a shared payout system. They let their machines rip, they pay their energy bill, they know that they will almost never win the reward, and they are totally OK with doing this as a hobby to help secure the network. “You’re getting nothing out of it,” said Con Kolivasas, an Australia-based software engineer who administers a pool of solo miners called Solo CK. “That’s the reality of solo mining. There’s the dream and there’s the reality. I make it clear to people at the outset. Your chance of solving the block is miniscule.”  Kolivasas said there are about 2,700 solo miners using the Solo.ck pool, which at first sounds like a paradox. If they’re solo mining, why are they in a pool?  The solo pool is a different beast. If your tiny S9 bucks the odds and wins a block (which actually happened recently), you don’t split it with the other miners – you keep nearly all of it yourself. Kolivasas said that solo miners use the pool to take advantage of his faster and “lower latency” network connection, ensuring that if you hit the jackpot and win the block, you can claim the reward in time. (This can be tougher to do when truly going solo.) And who’s doing this exactly? Kolivasas doesn’t know the solo miners in person (anonymity is king), but from years of chatter on the message boards, he gathers that most are middle-aged men, “generally guys that live alone.”  “Econoalchemist” is not a solo miner, and he’s not a middle-aged man who lives alone. He has a wife and two little kids, and he recently lived in suburban Denver. He wanted to buy $300 of bitcoin each month, but, like Lili, said, “I couldn’t bring myself to spend that at KYC exchanges anymore.” He treasured his privacy and anonymity.  Like Lili, he found Bitcoin ATMs impractical. He also came across Diverter’s “Mining for the Streets” manifesto. He realized that if he bought an ASIC miner, instead of spending $300 at Coinbase each month, he’d use that $300 for his electricity bill. That would magically convert fiat to bitcoin. Soon he was thrilled to be getting “bitcoin for way cheaper than spot price,” and not just any bitcoin, but that sweet and coveted non-KYC bitcoin.  Econoalchemist has a long beard. He wears sunglasses and a baseball cap, and he looks like he could be the lead singer of an indie-folk band in Bushwick. When he bought his first miner, it worked so well that he decided to scale up, purchase another 13 machines, and set up an intricate cooling system that he chronicled on Twitter (fetching 734 Likes). Once his system was ready to go, he called the utility company to ensure his home was wired to handle 200 amps, as most are only configured for 100. (This is a common headache for many home miners.)  “Are you sure my house is rated for 200 amps?” he asked the power company.  They assured him that yes, absolutely, indeed it was.  “Cool, I’m going to pull like 150 amps worth of electricity.”  He started eight of the crypto miners. That was too hot, so he switched off two and let six of them rip. That seemed to do the trick. So he left the rig humming and headed to work at his day job (for a company that makes railroad equipment). Then his wife called with a status update: The power lines had caught on fire. It turns out the electric company had been mistaken; the home was only wired for 100 amps.  ""Screw it, we’re leaving,"" said Econoalchemist. By then he was so smitten with mining that he decided to move to the “Intermountain West” (his preferred anonymous term) where he had more space for rigs. The decision was aided by politics. At the time, he was fed up with his kids’ mask mandates at the Denver-area school, and his own stance on vaccine mandates (not a fan) got him fired from the railway job.  “My wife and I were like, and excuse my language here, but f**k this dystopia,” said Econoalchemist. After moving to his new home with more space, he bought a shipping container to house the rigs. Now he’s focused on it constantly, and he recently published his own jaw-droppingly thorough guide on setting up home mining. “There has been this explosion in home mining innovation,” he said. “This is all I do, every day, and I can’t keep up with it anymore.”  Read more: What Happens When All Bitcoin Are Mined?  The bitcoin mining rig arms race  Another aspect of recent innovation: Now you don’t even need to mine at home to be a home miner, or at least to be a “retail miner.” Scott Melker, aka “The Wolf of All Streets,” is a prominent crypto trader. He had long been curious about mining, but he was reluctant to personally deal with the maintenance or the noise. “It’s a bit daunting for anyone who’s not heavy into the tech,” said Melker.  So he outsourced all of that to Compass, which Foxley describes as the “Airbnb of bitcoin mining,” and now Compass handles the day-to-day operations of his miners located in far-flung warehouses. Some are in Canada, some are in Russia. Melker has never touched these rigs. But he pays the electrical fees, he earns revenue from the pool, and mining has become another chunk of his portfolio.  “For me, it’s a way of passively dollar-cost averaging,” said Melker, referring to the practice of investing a fixed amount of money in set increments, regardless of the price. (The philosophy is mainstream and hardly crypto-specific; in 401(k) plans, when a set percentage of your paycheck is used to buy stocks or a mutual fund, that’s dollar-cost averaging.)  Here’s how he sees the math: Say his S19 miner (the more powerful and energy-efficient successor to the S9) costs $10,000. He pays that upfront. Then every day, thanks to the sharing mechanism of the pool, that S19 spits out between $20 to $40 worth of bitcoin, minus the cost of electricity. So effectively, that $10,000 of fiat is then converted to a steady stream of bitcoin that’s acquired at different prices. “And as an added bonus,” said Melker, “this is equipment that you can depreciate on your taxes.”  Then there’s the intangible appeal. “I always wanted to feel like I’m part of securing the network,” said Melker. He’s been in the crypto space for years, but in some ways he felt removed from the guts of it. “I’m a firm believer that you have to experience it to talk about it. Now I’m qualified to do so. Now I can say I’m a miner.”  Econoalchemist likes that home mining makes the bitcoin network more decentralized, and he loves that he now has a voice in the bitcoin mining ecosystem. “I’m doing something even more to participate in the bitcoin network than running a node,” he said. “I enabled myself to be able to vote with my hash rate. If one pool was doing something I didn’t like,” he said, such as censoring transactions (he points to MARA as an example), “then I could take my hash rate elsewhere.”  And for many, home mining is also just plain fun, like an arts-and-crafts hobby. When the S9 blew her circuit-board and became too noisy, Gronowska ended up moving it to her parents’ basement. (Nice parents.) Now she geeks out with her dad about bitcoin. “It created this thing we can bond over,” she said.  Her dad used to be an electrician in Poland, and while he was never particularly interested in bitcoin as a speculative investment, now he enjoys tinkering with the S9’s optimum wattage and finding ways to cool the system. The money isn’t much, maybe a couple of bucks per day. But just as some families use sports, memes, or even fantasy football as a way to stay in touch, Gronowska and her dad excitedly chat about the day’s block rewards. Almost on cue, on our Zoom call, she checks her phone and reads from the screen: “Slush Pool says, ‘You’ve earned 0.000092 bitcoin, which is about $3.48.’ That’s a little higher than what I’ve been seeing.”  That said, it’s also true that Gronowska had to move the miner out of her own home. It was loud. It was so damn loud that she couldn’t run it while doing podcasts or conference calls, which is why she looped in Dad. Every miner I spoke with complained about the noise. “When you plug it in, it’s effectively like running a shop-vac,” said Coin Heated. “It’s unbelievably noisy for a home.” (He also notes that there are now creative ways to reduce the noise, such as using Braains firmware to tweak the fan speed.)  Kolivasas said they sound “like a chainsaw going all day long.” He no longer mines at home because electricity in Australia is too expensive, but when he did, his garage was so loud that the local council came and complained, accusing him of noise pollution.  And there are some less obvious concerns. Econoalchemist, Lili, Gronowska, Coin Heated and the growing army of DIY-ers are finding mining to be profitable … for now. But that all hinges on a few key variables.  Econoalchemist is confident that his system would still turn a profit even if the network’s hashrate doubled (meaning the “difficulty” increased) while the price of bitcoin remained constant. But if bitcoin crashes far below $20,000? The math changes. It might even break. This is why virtually all miners are bullish on the long-term price of bitcoin. “All miners are hedging their bets that the price of bitcoin goes up,” Kolivasas said.  It’s also true that just as those old CPUs and GPUs became obsolete, the same will happen with the current crop of cryptocurrency miners. “The reason the S19 is relatively profitable at the moment is because China off-lined mining,” said Kolivasas. “Otherwise the current hash rate would be double.” He said we’re now in a sweet spot on the “curve” of mining equipment, meaning that the S19 is relatively new and efficient and profitable, but that won’t last forever. New rigs will inevitably make the S19 obsolete, argues Kolivasas, as “it’s an arms race. It has always been an arms race.”  Power to the generalists  Even with the surge in popularity, home mining only accounts for a skinny slice of the industry’s overall pie. “Home mining has definitely popped off,” said Foxley, “but I’d be surprised if it made up over 2% of bitcoin mining.” Voell said the exact number is hard to pinpoint because there’s no agreed-upon definition of “home mining.” Does it only count if someone has one miner? Five? 20? Everyone interviewed agreed that home mining made up less than 10% of the network (most guessed less than 5%). “It’s still pretty niche,” said Gronowska.  There’s less consensus on what will happen in the future. Gronowska notes that the giant mining operations, such as Marathon, continue to pour money into the space. “Yes, home mining will grow,” she said, “but hash rate is growing everywhere at industrial scale.” She noted that while home miners are collectively buying thousands of new machines, the industrial players are buying millions. So while she expects the number of home miners to increase, she guesses their share of the network will shrink.  Voell agrees that industrial mining is growing, but suspects that if the space encounters a true bear market, the plucky home miners will be more likely to ride it out. “It’s much more difficult to squeeze a retail miner out of the market,” said Voell. The big shops are only mining bitcoin to make money, he said, whereas the home miners – who also care about profit, sure – enjoy getting KYC-free bitcoin, they’re in it partly for the ideology, and sometimes they’re heating 17,000 gallon swimming pools. “Even if they’re running at a small loss,” said Voell, “they’ll run an ASIC or two just to participate in the network.”  That is almost certainly true of Econoalchemist and Lili. She now feels invested in the network, both literally and figuratively. She paid her dues. When she first installed the S9 in her basement, it was “so freaking loud” that she couldn’t work or watch TV. So she used Diverter’s guide and figured out how to nestle the S9 in a cooler and snake the exhaust out a window. This required a botched experiment of sawing wood, but she eventually got the job done.  That was satisfying. Even fun. She likes that she didn’t need to be a mechanic or an engineer (her background is in finance); she just followed the DIY tools of the community and figured it out. She didn’t need millions of dollars of capital; she just needed a few hundred bucks and a willingness to learn.  “There was a lot of FUD going around saying that it’s not profitable for you to mine, and it’s very hard, and that you have to build this big thing,” said Lili.  Striking a more philosophical note, she wonders why all of us are forced into being specialists, and staying in the lanes of our professions, as opposed to trying out new skills. Why can’t we be generalists? Why can’t we do more than one thing? “I think everyone should try it out,” said Lili. “I think anyone can mine.”  UPDATE (March 21, 19:53 UTC): Corrects default hashrate for the S9 miner.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Jeff Wilser,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2022/03/21/dont-call-it-a-comeback-the-unlikely-rise-of-home-bitcoin-mining,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/84aa55965490191a078933cd5702bb0b56e3ff3c-1440x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42390177,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bX2lFV,1647869327,"Will Belarus Lure Crypto Miners Amid Sanctions, Russia-Ukraine War?","Belarus is trying to attract cryptocurrency miners with low taxes to boost its economy. But will global investors put money into a country often referred to as “Europe’s last dictatorship”?  In 2017, President Alexander Lukashenko signed a decree to facilitate the creation of high-tech businesses, including crypto mining. The decree, which took effect in 2018, also recognized smart contracts as legally enforceable – a global first.  This piece is part of CoinDesk's Mining Week series.  More recently, in September 2021 Belarus introduced special electricity tariffs for crypto miners; in January it started paving the way for investment funds to buy crypto.  “There aren’t many points of growth for our economy today,” said Denis Aleinikov, a senior partner at Aleinikov & Partners, a law firm in the capital city of Minsk. “The government has to do something brave and unusual.”  Under the decree, which Aleinikov helped draft, businesses in Minsk’s High-Tech Park (HTP) are exempt from corporate taxes on profits. Instead, they pay just 1% of their gross revenue, according to Dmitry Matveyev, a partner at Aleinikov’s firm. It takes two months for a company with the necessary documents to be admitted to the park, he said.  Despite these incentives, Belarus, with a population of 9 million, accounts for less than 0.01% of the entire Bitcoin network's hashrate, a measure of computing power on the network, according to the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index. By comparison, Sweden, with 10 million people, accounts for 1.18% of the network’s hashrate, according to the same index.  Read More: What Does Hashrate Mean and Why Does It Matter?  Belarus’s struggle to lure miners shows how, despite favorable business conditions, a country's political environment can be a major deterrent in attracting international capital. That was the case even before Russian President Vladmir Putin, Lukashenko’s close ally, invaded Ukraine. The war has brought fresh sanctions against Russia and Belarus from the West and it remains to be seen how this will affect Minsk’s allure as a place to spin up mining rigs.  The sanctions could increase interest in crypto, said an executive at a Belarussian tech provider, who requested anonymity, citing the country's sensitive political situation. The Minsk High Tech Park is discussing allowing residents to use crypto for settlements between counterparties, he said, which indicates that crypto could soon be used for to circumvent sanctions.  The main change after the war in Ukraine is that ballooning sanctions “may just further incentivize the Belarussian government to accelerate activity in the mining sector since they may need to find ways to work around the restrictions,” said David Carlisle, the director of policy and regulatory affairs at blockchain analytics firm Elliptic.  New electricity tariffs for crypto miners  “At the moment, small-scale private mining is more common in Belarus,” said Yury Kaliaha, mining director for local miner GreenMiner. Until recently the electricity tariffs were too high for industrial-scale mining, Kaliaha said.  In September, the government announced crypto miners would pay preferential electricity prices, as would other types of data centers. According to the Belarussian tech provider, miners usually pay $0.07 to $0.09 per kilowatt hour (kWh), and the lowest rate is $0.058 per kWh.  Read more:Belarus Introduces Special Electricity Tariff for Miners  That’s on a par with or better than electricity prices in U.S. states like Texas and Washington, where massive mining operations have been built in the last two years. There, prices range from $0.07 to $0.09 per kWh, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s Global Energy Institute.  Belarus’ electricity tariff depends on the size of the mining operation, with mines with an energy capacity of approximately 3 megawatts (MW) or more subject to lower tariffs, explained Vitali Sabaleuski, founder of Minsk crypto miner United Mining Company. Sabaleuski’s firm mines ether (ETH) and bitcoin (BTC) with a total hashrate of about 50 gigahashes, a small operation by global standards.  Another breakthrough for Belarus’s energy market was its first nuclear plant, which started running in June 2021. The plant has a power capacity of 1,110 megawatts (MW), according to the World Nuclear Association. Another reactor is expected to be operational later in 2022, adding 1,110 MW to the grid. Both projects are financed by Russia.  “This power plant produces more power than we need in Belarus. Hence, we’ll have to either export electricity or mine crypto assets,” Matveyev said. The higher the consumption of electricity from the nuclear plant, the more prices will be lowered, as the plant makes back its original investment, the lawyer added.  Kaliaha said that while a lot of incentives for crypto mining have been created, the barrier remains high because obtaining a special tariff is reserved for fairly large operations, approximately 3MW.  “Even though there are enthusiastic private individuals trying to mine bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, in general, the government is waiting for large investors to provide them with some capacities and then collect taxes from them,” he said.  Some investors have taken note of the new tariffs. “There are requests from investors to host mining sites, but so far these are rare. Most of them are miners from Russia and China,” the tech provider's executive said, citing the Ministry of Economy.  Sabaleuski is working with miners from Eastern Europe who are looking to move some of their hashrate to Belarus. He noted that due to the current policy uncertainty in Russia, many miners there are considering moving their operations.  Kaliaha, who is setting up a company to provide service for turnkey miners in Belarus, is helping a Singaporean company with its Minsk HTP paperwork. The company is looking to engage in mining in Belarus.  A question of stability  It is hoped the new infrastructure will bring a stable electricity supply to Belarus, such that crypto miners’ operations are not interrupted or curtailed, miners said.  In another part of the former Soviet bloc, in Kazakhstan, the national grid has crumbled under the pressure of an influx of miners in 2021 as well as failures in the infrastructure. Electricity was initially rationed and eventually cut off to legally operating mines, despite government assurances.  The energy system is one of Belarus’s strengths, and the construction of the new nuclear plant will help the country avoid pitfalls similar to Kazakhstan’s, according to Kaliaha.  While the Belarussian power grid, inherited from the USSR., has depreciated, its condition is not as critical as those in Kazakhstsan or Kosovo, a local executive said. Theoretically, if there is a huge jump in new mining sites, blackouts could occur, he acknowledged. But the government is working with energy producers and distributors to estimate the grid load before granting mining licenses to avoid an electricity crunch, he said. Given that it is unlikely a huge number of miners will migrate overnight, the grid can withstand the power demand from miners, the tech provider said.  Read more:Kazakh Crypto Miners Cut Off From Electricity Supply Until End of January  Other than energy security, many Western investors question the political stability in Belarus, given its image in the international press. Headlines related to Belarus in the last few years have been dominated by the violent suppression of anti-government protests, the forced landing of a commercial plane carrying an opposition figure, and what the European Union calls the “instrumentalisation of human beings” related to migrants and refugees being pushed from Belarus to EU borders.  Most recently, Belarus’ involvement in the war in Ukraine has come under severe scrutiny. Russian troops entered Belarus for military drills and then allegedly drove south to attack Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv. The Kremlin has also reportedly used Belarussian land to launch missiles on Ukraine. President Lukashenko has repeatedly denied that he plans to deploy active troops in battle.  Capital allocation demands stability, and crypto mining businesses are realizing this, said Alan Konevsky, chief legal officer at U.S. bitcoin mining firm PrimeBlock. Konevsky pointed to China and Kazakhstan as examples of places where political instability has decimated the mining industry.  Lawyers Aleinikov and Metveyev said the Lukashenko government is committed to attracting crypto miners, and tech firms more broadly, at least in the medium term.  Since the president’s decree came into effect in March 2018 there have been no changes, they pointed out. Many IT firms that set up at the HTP after the decree are still there, they said. The two said they expect the government to extend the tax benefits afforded to crypto miners.  Mining has received broad support from government branches, said Sabaleuski, who has been sitting in meetings with the authorities. The Ministry of Economy finds the mining sector favorable because it essentially converts Belarussian assets, namely electricity, into an export product, cryptocurrencies. The central bank sees it as the first step towards building blockchain wallets and a digital currency, whereas the customs authorities enjoy revenue from imported equipment.  The entrepreneur added that unlike in other countries of the former Soviet bloc, miners in Belarus don’t have to worry their machines will be stolen overnight, he said.  International sanctions and crypto mining  There is one political aspect that distinguishes Belarus from other former Soviet countries: It is sanctioned by the U.S. and EU  The tech provider knows this is an issue: “The negative picture of our country after the events of August 2020 worries both private business and the authorities. Given the situation, it is unlikely that we will be able to attract cryptocurrency miners from Europe, United States, Canada or other countries anytime soon.”  A wave of anti-government protests had already been underway when, in August 2020, Lukashenko was once again declared the winner of the presidential election. The government responded to the civil unrest with batons and rubber bullets, including attacks on journalists, according to human rights group Amnesty International.  While the Belarussian power grid, inherited from the USSR., has depreciated, its condition is not as critical as those in Kazakhstsan or Kosovo, asaid. Theoretically, if there is a huge jump in new mining sites, blackouts could occur, he acknowledged. But the government is working with energy producers and distributors to estimate the grid load before granting mining licenses to avoid an electricity crunch, he said. Given that it is unlikely a huge number of miners will migrate overnight, the grid can withstand the power demand from miners, said the executive from the tech provider.  United Mining Group’s Sabaleuski said he hasn’t faced any issues with sourcing equipment. All it takes is finding a supplier in Hong Kong or mainland China or one in Moscow, if looking for cheaper equipment, he said.  The sanctions to which Belarus is subject are not similar to the near-blanket bans on Iran or North Korea. They target specific entities and people, usually associated with alleged government abuses.  “Theoretically, Belarussian companies engaged in mining that aren't subject to sanctions are not necessarily restricted from doing business with companies from other parts of the world,” said Carlisle.  There’s a catch: Crypto mining firms that leverage “state-owned energy or industrial infrastructure” could be subject to sanctions, said Carlisle, who previously worked on sanctions enforcement in the U.S. Treasury Department. A company that is simply reaping some tax or other benefits from the government is not problematic, but in a case where, for example, the government receives windfall profits from a firm’s activities, sanctions law could kick in.  It is possible to do business in Belarus while avoiding sanctioned companies, Sabaleuski said. “You know who they are, and you can just avoid doing business with them,” he said.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION,Eliza Gkritsi,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/03/21/will-belarus-lure-crypto-miners-amid-sanctions-russia-ukraine-war,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/581caeaaa05d0d889a006b29b9cce5dff08f5aac-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In a report published Monday following a two-month consultation with members, the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) said regulators need tougher tools to deal with a new cohort of younger, non-professional investors.  The IOSCO is an international policy forum for securities regulators whose membership – the U.S. Securities and Exchanges Commission and the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority among them – regulate more than 95% of the globe’s securities markets across 130 jurisdictions.  “Innovative technologies and social media are transforming important aspects of retail investing,” Ashley Alder, the Hong Kong regulator who chairs IOSCO’s board, said in a statement Monday.  Monday’s report makes clear that crypto trading is first among the risky, and often unregulated activities focused on by the group. “Trading on crypto-asset trading platforms often occurs unaccompanied by investor and market protections against fraud, manipulation, insider trading and frontrunning, among other things,” the IOSCO report said, listing some of the financial practices regulators have long regarded as abusive.  “Crypto-assets with high volatility might be unsuitable for most retail consumers,” it added.  Such regulatory attention is nothing new. Lately, jurisdictions including the European Union and India have introduced curbs and warnings for potential investors, and U.S. President Joe Biden recently ordered federal agencies to work together to better protect crypto consumers and safeguard financial stability.  The IOSCO, however, worries that’s not enough because would-be crypto buyers can potentially escape national rules by accessing websites based in other countries. Plenty of people are also getting advice, not from professional intermediaries, but from online contacts on platforms like Reddit – something of which the authorities took a dim view.  “The impact of social media on retail investor behavior and decision-making was perceived negatively by IOSCO members,” said the report. “​The cross-border nature of the offerings require a coordinated regulatory response.”  IOSCO can’t make laws. While the paper is just an attempt to ask the opinions of traders, exchanges and academics, it could end up as guidance for what may be global action.  Jurisdictions including the U.K. and EU have already banned complex retail financial products – contracts for difference and binary options, for example – on the basis that regular investors need to be protected from their own risky behavior.  Now, IOSCO is asking if social media should “be subject to additional regulatory obligations regarding securities trading and/or crypto-asset trading,” and is suggesting platforms like apps using game-style incentives to encourage people to more actively trade could be forbidden altogether.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/03/21/social-media-crypto-advice-gamification-targeted-by-global-standard-setters-at-iosco,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/689c3720042fd5194ab642c4cde4d98c5aaaf0c2-1024x683.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Sign up here to get it in your inbox each weekday morning.  Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market Moves: Bitcoin trades sideways, traditional markets remain cautious as China keeps interest rates unchanged.  Featured stories: Bitcoin futures open interest on the CME signals a price bottom. Ether's breakout from triangular consolidation indicates path of least resistance is to the higher side.  And check out the CoinDesk TV show “First Mover,” hosted by Christine Lee, Emily Parker and Lawrence Lewitinn at 9:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern time.  Denelle Dixon, CEO and executive director, Stellar Development Foundation  Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner, Fairlead Strategies  Aoyon Ashraf, U.S. mining reporter, CoinDesk  Market Moves  By Omkar Godbole  Bitcoin traded sideways around $41,000 early Monday while traditional markets were cautious as China kept interest rates unchanged, disappointing markets.  Hopes of a cut had increased in the wake of Vice Premier Liu He, President Xi Jinping’s top economic adviser, recent assurance that Beijing would roll out support for the Chinese economy and be cautious with measures for capital markets.  The top cryptocurrency's implied volatility trended lower, extending last week's slide, a sign of continued selling of options or volatility by sophisticated traders. ""The desk saw a tremendous amount of vol selling post-FOMC. From the highs of nearly 100%, both BTC and ETH front-end vols have dropped to 60%. A truly massive move,"" QCP Capital said in Saturday's Telegram broadcast.  One-week, one-, three- and six-month put-call skews held around 2% versus the highs around 5% to 7% before the Federal Reserve raised interest rates. The skews are down significantly from February highs of around 8%-10%, a sign of continued weakening of demand for puts or downside protection.  Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, rose nearly 2% to $2,920, having jumped 13% last week, the biggest gain in six weeks. Traders talking to CoinDesk said Ethereum's impending proof-of-work and proof-of-stake mechanism would have bullish implications for the programmable blockchain's native token, ether.  The Bored Ape Yacht Club-linked ApeCoin (APE) jumped 11% to $10.70, according to data provided by the charting platform TradingView. Leading decentralized asset management platform Ribbon Finance launched an option vault tied to APE. All holders have to do is deposit their coins in the vault, which will sell a one-week APE covered call each Friday. At press time, the projected annualized yield from the APE covered call strategy was 42%.  Other major gainers were THORChain's RUNE token, WAVES, DASH and liquid staking protocol Lido's LDO token.  ""Since a portion of staking rewards are obtained as revenue for the Lido DAO, the price of their governance token (LDO) has been appreciating,"" IntoTheBlock said in the weekly newsletter published Friday.  On March 15, approximately 190,000 ETH was deposited into Lido’s stETH liquid staking, according to data tracked by the IntoTheBlock.

Open interest has breached the trendline falling from November highs. In other words, the CME open interest suggests the downtrend is over.  Historically, a breakout in the CME's open interest has coincided with the end of bear runs and reversal higher in the spot market. Open interest dived out of an uptrend line at the end of April 2021, warning of an impending sell-off. Bitcoin crashed in mid-May.  Ether breakout  Ether (ETH) broke out of a multi-week contracting triangle on Friday, indicating the path of least resistance is to the higher side.  The cryptocurrency's bounce from the upper end of the triangle early today has reinforced the breakout and perhaps opened the doors for higher prices.  The immediate resistance is seen at $3,284 (Feb. 10 high).",NEUTRAL,BTC | LDO | APE,BTC | MARKET | TRADING | LDO | APE,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/03/21/first-mover-americas-cme-futures-open-interest-hints-at-bitcoin-bottom-ether-breaks-out,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6859ce035268e269d26ce0a1992288ea5c3ac35a-612x408.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42390179,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bX2lPl,1647868378,What Does a Crypto Mining Farm Look Like? Striking Photos From Siberia to Spain,"Crypto mining comes in many shapes and sizes, from mega mines under the blazing Texas sun to small facilities nestled in Italy’s snowy Alps.  CoinDesk reporters traveled across Europe, Asia and North America to capture the diversity of crypto mining farms. Mining is a little understood industry, in large part because miners tend to be extremely secretive. Security concerns coupled with regulatory uncertainty have made this industry wary of the limelight. The fact that many miners started as maverick entrepreneurs plugging straight into hydropower plants in China did not help the industry’s reputation..  As a result, the image often conjured up when thinking of crypto miners is one of gigantic facilities burning fossil fuels or stealing electricity from the grid – which is far from the whole truth. The public debate around crypto mining understandably relies on this image, as incomplete as it is.  This article is part of CoinDesk's Mining Week series.  There is no question that crypto mining requires energy. Miners convert it into hashes, or algorithmically produced strings of letters and numbers. These represent the ""guesses"" that each mining rig makes in trying to ""find"" a new bitcoin block. The best miners can produce over 100 terahashes per second (TH/s). The latest model from Bitmain, the biggest manufacturer of specialized mining hardware, can reach 255 TH/s. (One terahash equals 1 trillion hashes. One petahash represents 1 quadrillion hashes. One exahash represents 1 quintillion hashes.)  The industry today employs a patchwork of approaches to this task, and it has grown in innovation and sophistication over the years.  This photo essay is aimed at informing the conversation around crypto mining by showing its modes of existence, many of which are powered by renewable energy.  Read More:How Bitcoin Mining Works  Kryptovault, Hønefoss, Norway  Just an hour outside Oslo, the capital of Norway, lies Hønefoss (population: 14,000). When CoinDesk visited in late February it was an unusually sunny day for winter, and the snow was slowly melting. The cold weather is perfect for a crypto mining farm, as it decreases the cost of cooling the machines.  Oslo-based Kryptovault runs a 40-megawatt (MW) crypto mine in the suburbs. Of that capacity, only 18 megawatts are currently running, CEO Kjetil Pettersen told CoinDesk during a tour. The firm unplugged all of its Bitmain Antminer S9s in late 2021 and is replacing them with newer, and more energy-efficient S19s.  This is a common practice among crypto miners: as newer machines come online, older models can’t keep profits up, unless the operation has access to very cheap electricity.  Due to the facility’s proximity to the residential area and complaints from the neighbors, Kryptovault had to spend just under $2 million to install noise-reducing panels.  The Kryptovault mine is also offering a byproduct of bitcoin (BTC) mining to a local company for free: heat. A lumber company is using the excess heat from the computation to dry wood that it later sells. Heat from the mining rigs is pumped into containers outside the facility where the wood is dried.  South Spain, PoW Energy, PoW Containers, Meatze  We drove from Madrid to the south of Spain for about four hours to visit the PoW Containers mining farm. We passed through countless almond and olive groves, took several turns down country roads, including one long dirt road, to arrive at the solar-powered mine.  All of Spain had 14 gigawatts (GW) of energy produced by solar panels in 2020, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency, most of them in the southern part of the country.  This general-purpose solar farm has a maximum capacity of 10MW, and the bitcoin mine consumes in about 500 kilowatts (KW) – a tiny portion. The mine is a hedge for the farm which otherwise only has one option, to sell the energy to the grid, said Jon Arregi, founder of Meatze and Proof of Work Containers, two firms that are building modular container mines and deploying them at sites across Europe. Similarly, at night the mine draws its energy from the grid.  Electricity from the solar farm is converted from low to high voltage and is pumped straight into the machines, Arregi said.  The mining machines, which produce about 12 petahashes/second in total, are housed in an unmarked container to avoid prying eyes – security is a big concern in an industry where an individual machine can cost more than $10,000. This particular mine is not visited frequently barring emergencies, and is far from any residential facility, making security an even bigger challenge.  To avoid the machines overheating in the hot Spanish sun, the PoW company uses immersion cooling. This technology involves putting the machines in drawers and then filling the drawers up with a specialized mineral oil. When the machines are running, the hot oil rises to the surface and is then cooled down as it passes through a series of pipes, which touch separate pipes through which cold water runs. The cold oil is then pumped back into the drawer.  HIVE Blockchain, Boden, Sweden  In March, CoinDesk visited one of HIVE Blockchain’s (HIVE) largest crypto mining farms located in Boden, a military town in north Sweden. The sprawling 6,000 square-foot facility, set up in what used to be a military helicopter hanger, now houses more than 15,000 mining rigs. When CoinDesk visited, the facility was being expanded further and will soon be home to upwards of 17,000 machines and 120,000 graphics processing units (GPU). A majority of the machines are RX580s by AMD.  The 30MW facility draws energy from two hydropower plants nearby. A majority of its energy is purchased from Vattenfall, a Swedish state-owned multinational power company. Ether (ETH) accounts for around 80% of the crypto mined at the facility. The rest is bitcoin.  The Boden crypto mining farm is an impressive maze of machines, organized in a way that optimizes the cooling systems and pressure conditions for high efficiency. As we moved through the facility, every few feet the temperature changed dramatically, as if we were teleporting between the Arctic and a tropical beach each time. The area just outside an opening through which hot air leaves the facility is dubbed the “no snow” zone, and is the only stretch of space on the property not covered in ice or a dusting of snow.  The facility is constantly evolving to improve mining efficiency, a HIVE representative told CoinDesk. The team is always testing new machines, replacing old rigs with the latest ones, looking for ways to stack more machines into a smaller space. “We even use the same air twice,” the representative said.  HIVE blockchain is a publicly traded company, with mining facilities in Sweden, Iceland and Canada. The Boden ether mining farm was set up in 2017.  Alta Novella, Borgo d'Anaunia, Italian Alps  After a short scenic train ride southward from Northern Italy’s famed Alpine ski towns, and a grizzly 20-minute car ride down icy mountain roads, we arrived at Alta Novella, a small hydropower plant belonging to the town of Borgo d’Anaunia, home to around 2,500 people.  Alta Novella recently became home to Italy’s first bitcoin mining farm run by a municipality. Nestled against a wall behind the power plant’s turbine are 40 ASIC miners. Borgo d’Anaunia’s Millennial mayor Daniele Graziadei persuaded his constituents to invest in the miners as a way to diversify the plant’s income.  The power plant draws water from a small river. Depending on the river’s flow, the plant can generate 120 to 600 kilowatt hours. If the plant’s total production reaches 600KW, about a fifth of it goes to the miners.  This winter, rain was scarce. During low production times, small plants like this would typically shut down because they cannot cover costs. But Graziadei told CoinDesk that thanks to the miners, the plant can stay operational during low seasons with around half of its production channeled to the miners. When CoinDesk visited in February only a handful of the 40 ASICs stood blinking against the wall. It’s a small operation; one you might easily fit into your average basement. However, it is projected to make a significant impact on the power plant’s sustainability, said Graziadei.  Alps Blockchain, the Italian mining startup that set up the machines and now takes care of maintenance, purchases the computing power produced by Alta Novella's miners at around 35% more than what the government offers per kilowatt hour of energy. The computing power is then sold to mining pools around the world. The profits from mining helps Alta Novella cover maintenance costs, Graziadei said.  Valstagna, Veneto, Northern Italy  In February CoinDesk visited Valstagna, a century-old historic hydropower plant located in the Veneto region of Italy. Nestled in a valley framed by mammoth mountains, Valstagna, which supplied power to the local steel industry, now supplies power to the national grid. It is also one of 18 hydropower plants across northern Italy that have partnered with local tech startup Alps Blockchain to mine bitcoin on site.  The contrast between the old and new is stark: Towering over the power plant’s turbines are two shelves carrying 300 ASICs. When CoinDesk visited, the facility was preparing to set up another shelf with 150 more mining rigs. The residents in the surrounding town have no idea their neighborhood power plant is mining bitcoin, a representative at the plant told CoinDesk.  The Valstagna power plant has a maximum capacity of 10MW, but production varies significantly. A portion of around 1MW is constantly used for mining bitcoin. Alps Blockchain purchases the computing power produced at the power plants for more competitive rates. Valstagna is one facility belonging to a large local power producer: it is looking to expand mining operations to its other locations in partnership with Alps Blockchain.  Bitfarms, Québec  CoinDesk visited three Bitfarms (BITF) mining facilities, one of the biggest bitcoin mining operations in Canada. The publicly traded company has a total of six sites in Canada and three upcoming in Washington state, Paraguay and Argentina. The company is aiming to reach a hashrate of 3 exahashes per second (EH/s) by the end of Q1 2022 and 8 EH/s by year’s end.  CoinDesk visited Bitfarms' three sites in the province of Quebec, Canada. One site, in the small town of Cowansville, is fully operational. The other two, in the larger town of Sherbrooke, are under construction. All of the miner’s sites operate using hydropower at an average cost of about $0.04 cents per kilowatt hour. For comparison, Marathon Digital (MARA), one of the largest publicly traded miners, said recently that to host its more than 100,000 miners across the U.S., the total cost for the miners will be about $0.042 per kilowatt hour. Meanwhile, the average retail electricity cost during 2020 in Texas, home of many bitcoin miners, was $0.0858 per kilowatt hour, according to the Global Energy Institution.  The Bunker facility in Sherbrooke, which was designed by the previous tenants to be an ethanol distillery, is a bomb-proof plant (hence the name). It will have 18MW in phase one, another 18MW in phase two and a further 12MW in phase three during the summer. When completed, the facility will produce almost 1 EH/s from this one facility alone.  The Leger facility, which is about 3 kilometers (1.86 miles) away from Bunker, will have 30MW and 800 PH/s mining power. Both Sherbrooke facilities are entirely powered by hydro electricity, which 99% is green energy, meaning a renewable source of energy.     Aside from hydro power, another big advantage of being in Quebec is “passive” heat management. To counteract the heat generated by Bitfarms' massive operation, the facilities don't need an active air cooling system. Instead, due to the colder climate, Bitfarms is able to use outside air to cool the mining computers, limiting the operating cost and energy use.  BitCluster, Norilsk, Russia  The frozen steppes of north Russia are perfect for crypto mines (notwithstanding the geopolitical climate), with ample space and cool temperatures in a location that few other industries want to inhabit.  “Sometimes our task is not to cool devices but to warm them,” a BitCluster representative told CoinDesk. The company also trains its own employees to run the mines, hiring from local cities, the representatives said.  In Norilsk, the second-largest city above the Arctic Circle, bitcoin mines coexist with the metallurgy industry. The city, where temperatures can drop to -40 degrees Fahrenheit, gets most of its income from processing nickel, copper, cobalt, platinum, palladium and coal mined in nearby deposits.  The bitcoin mine is housed in a former nickel processing plant and has a capacity of 31MW, the firm told CoinDesk.  “All our data centers are located in special industrial zones,” a BitCluster representative said. In Russia, these are often inaccessible to the public, and journalists need special permission to enter.

42390173,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bX2kuz,1647867720,Introducing CoinDesk’s Mining Week,"Get ready to take a deep dive into the mines.  Crypto mining plays a critical role in bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies, including dogecoin (DOGE), litecoin (LTC) and zcash (ZEC), that use “proof of work” to secure the network. Mining has become a multibillion-dollar international industry, with participants ranging from plucky home miners to publicly traded companies. Like any big industry, cryptocurrency mining faces no shortage of political and public relations headaches. It’s the reason crypto is regularly accused of “cooking the Earth” but also a big part of why global investors trust a leaderless currency with an unknown creator.  In a new series, CoinDesk surveys the fast-changing crypto mining landscape, including the migration of bitcoin’s hash power from China after last year’s ban, diverse efforts to reduce cryptocurrency mining’s environmental impact and the benefits and controversies that mining operations bring to the local communities in which they operate. Our journalists and analysts visited mining farms around the world, interviewed key participants and crunched network data to paint a rich, nuanced picture of a little-understood business. We’ll publish it all here.  Over the course of Mining Week (March 21-25) we’ll be publishing feature articles, explainers, opinion pieces, data visualizations, videos, podcasts and other content that explores this dynamic, fascinating field. From proposals to modify Bitcoin’s software to cut energy consumption to up-and-comer projects that claim to be greener alternatives; from energy producers mining coins to make extra money and reduce waste to neighbors complaining about noise and higher electricity rates, this is a must-read package.  We hope Mining Week helps newcomers and crypto veterans alike deepen their understanding of a foundational part of the ecosystem.  Will Bitcoin Mining Decentralize?

The company, which CEO Joshua Frank said is profitable, has found a lucrative niche building digital asset research hubs that track prices and news headlines. It’s now preparing to turn the SigDev flagship into an all-encompassing crypto-trader workstation.  “We’re going to build a platform that powers the entire workflow of institutions,” Frank said in an interview with CoinDesk. “We want to be [the hub] from the time they get to the desk, to the time they leave.”  That vision would set SigDev and its 55-person team in almost direct competition with the financial landscape’s entrenched workspace leaders, like Bloomberg Launchpad. More specifically to digital assets, a number of data and news firms are eager to replicate Bloomberg Terminal’s success.  Making sense of crypto’s hectic alpha is the challenge, Frank said: Institutional investors can’t afford to spend their days hopping between dozens of Telegram channels, Twitter feeds and Discord servers – “it just doesn’t make sense.”  “In traditional capital markets there are consolidated platforms,” he said. “We think there's a massive opportunity” to build one for crypto “that helps institutions make smarter decisions.”  Those two worlds are mixing; for starters, in The TIE’s crypto-heavy but increasingly institutional capitalization table. Hudson River Trading, GoldenTree Asset Management, NYDIG, Gemini, Republic and other client-investors joined the round led by Blizzard. (CoinDesk is a SigDev client.)  Ava Labs President John Wu joined The TIE’s board, a press release said.  Frank said banks and hedge funds spend hundreds of millions a year on proprietary data streams that document traditional financial rails. Crypto’s institutionalization is set to divert ever more of that cash into specialist products.  Looking beyond funds  The TIE also plans to cater to builders, such as token projects. One new product, called Token Labs, analyzes marketing and social media trends to help founders determine the optimal press strategies.  Labs seeks to answer “things as granular as what day of the week should we be tweeting, what time of day, which influencers should we be working with, which publications should we be publishing in depending on what impact they have on social activity,” he said.  It pulls this data from social media and search engines, he said. Labs creates a “dashboard” for marketers to track even sentiment. Frank called it a “data incubation tool for go-to-market strategy.”  “A huge number of the top assets” already use this service, he said, “but it’s all been super quiet.” Avalanche is one such client, he added.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | SPONSORED | RESEARCH,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/03/21/the-tie-valued-at-100m-as-data-service-courts-institutional-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8271d58ae6a04eb23cdf05a9c214bae5d6c03055-3000x2000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42417135,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcSJwVB,1647866410,"After Short-Lived Ban, City in Upstate NY Is Still Reckoning With Crypto Miners","PLATTSBURGH, N.Y. – In a rundown strip mall, behind a Family Dollar store and a plastic recycling facility, tens of thousands of specialized computers packed into shipping containers mine bitcoin 24-7.  Unless they were looking for it, visitors to Skyway Plaza might not even notice the cryptocurrency mining operation, run by Coinmint, a firm based 1,860 miles away, in San Juan, Puerto Rico. There are no obvious signs bearing the operator’s name, no telltale giveaways save the whirring hum of the computers and the constant whoosh of industrial fans.  Some doors to the facility are left propped open day and night, probably to prevent the computers from overheating. Others are covered with metal grates, pocked with sun-faded candy wrappers and other trash blown in by the wind.  This article is part of CoinDesk's Mining Week series  During multiple trips to the 10-megawatt facility, CoinDesk didn’t observe any staff or security guards (cameras and bright spotlights might be enough to deter would-be thieves). Locals told CoinDesk that during winter months, homeless people are known to wander in through the open doors, seeking a warm place to sleep.  Three miles away, at the Imperial Mill, a former wallpaper factory-turned-industrial park, another miner called Zafra LLC is building a 2-megawatt facility. When CoinDesk visited in early March, the facilities were clean, well-lit and overseen by a uniformed security guard.  Zafra’s CEO, Ryan Brienza, showed off a newly installed cooling system and explained how heat generated from the operation was being used to warm neighboring units in the industrial park. Brienza’s high school friend, a full-time Zafra employee, was at work painting the company’s custom-made metal mining containers a vibrant blue.  The contrast between these two outfits helps illustrate why Plattsburgh, a sleepy college town in New York’s North Country about 20 miles from the Canadian border, became a poster child for the hot-and-cold relationship between local communities and crypto mining operations.  But far more important than their contribution (or detriment) to the quality of life is the strain these businesses place on the cost of living.  Plattsburgh’s 18-month mining moratorium  Plattsburgh made international headlines in March 2018 when it became the first U.S. city to ban cryptocurrency mining. Mining operations had flocked there the year before for its dirt-cheap electricity, but residents soon began complaining of skyrocketing energy bills and loud noises from whirring computers and the industrial-grade fans used to cool the mining facilities.  The municipal government, under the leadership of then-mayor Colin Read, a professor of economics and finance at the State University of New York at Plattsburgh, voted to enact a 18-month moratorium on commercial crypto mining in the city.  The moratorium wasn’t meant to push the miners out of Plattsburgh, Read recently told CoinDesk, but rather to give the city time to sort out how to make them better neighbors – neighbors that wouldn’t keep passing on ballooning power costs to residential users every month, or drive locals mad with constant noise.  In February 2019, the moratorium was lifted – seven months ahead of schedule. Read’s administration had come up with a host of solutions aimed at reducing the burden the miners had placed on the community.  The biggest step was the passage of Rider A – a fresh tariff structure agreement with the New York Public Service Commission that ensured that if the city had to purchase extra power on the spot market, the costs would be passed on to miners, not residential users.  The city also passed a local ordinance that set noise limits and required mining operations to find a way to recycle the heat generated by their machines.  As more New York state lawmakers rally behind a new bill that aims to put a three-year moratorium on crypto mining operations located in former power plants (a popular location choice for many of the state’s miners), Plattsburgh offers a useful case study for local governments and businesses alike.  That could also extend outside New York and across the country. Mining bans and crackdowns in other countries including China have led to a rise in North American crypto mining. In late 2021, the U.S. became the leading destination for bitcoin miners, accounting for over a third of the global hashrate.  Cities across the U.S. are now grappling with what it means to have mining operations in their communities. And while concerns will differ from city to city (Plattsburgh’s residents were worried about their wallets, not the environment, for example, while operations in New York’s Finger Lakes region are running into environmental concerns about rising water temperature and fish-killing algal blooms) – Plattsburgh answers a question that more and more lawmakers will soon be asking themselves: What happens when you ban crypto mining?  Cheap and abundant hydropower is a draw for mining farms  Like many cities in New York, Plattsburgh gets its electricity from the Niagara River, which generates abundant and renewable hydroelectric power.  Through a long-term contract with the Niagara Power Authority set in the 1950s, Plattsburgh is able to sell industrial power for a mere 1.9 cents per kilowatt hour (residential users pay 4.5 cents) – one of the lowest prices in the U.S. and a fraction of the nationwide average cost of 13 cents per kilowatt hour.  The bottom line is simple: The cheaper miners can get their power, the more they will make in profits.  Read, the former mayor, told CoinDesk that by his calculations, Coinmint was earning about $19 million per month in profit at the height of its operation in Plattsburgh before the moratorium. Coinmint didn’t respond to CoinDesk’s requests for comment for this story.  But while Plattsburgh’s power might be abundant, it is not unlimited.  The city’s monthly quota allowance of 120 megawatts, also set in the 1950s, is more than enough for Plattsburgh’s roughly 20,000 residents, who typically use less than half the quota in the summer months.  But in the winter, when Plattsburgh’s residents are all using electricity to heat their homes in below-freezing temperatures, there’s less to go around. That’s when the problems began.  The winter months straddling the end of 2017 and the beginning of 2018 were particularly cold in the North Country – and particularly good for the price of bitcoin.  For several months in a row, Plattsburgh’s miners, in combination with high residential power usage, pushed the city to the brink of its power quota, forcing the municipal power authority to buy expensive power on the spot market to keep the lights on.  Residents and other local businesses were outraged to see their bills skyrocket. The city hosted town hall meetings where residents complained of bills hundreds of dollars more than expected. The chief financial officer for Mold-Rite Plastics, a large local manufacturer, reported bills $60,000 higher than the typical rate in January and February 2018.  “We had a lot of very upset public testimony,” Read told CoinDesk. “We realized we needed to do something to protect our ratepayers.”  By March 2018, the moratorium was in place.  A tale of two mining companies  Coinmint, the biggest mining operation in Plattsburgh, pushed back against the new rules.  The company sued the city to avoid paying a million-dollar security deposit required by Rider A, and citing rising electricity costs, it moved the majority of its computing activity, or hash power, to Massena, N.Y. – a former industrial town in the Finger Lakes region with more expensive industrial power.  Coinmint purchased a former Alcoa aluminum smelting facility in Massena, where it reportedly operates an 80-megawatt mining operation. In Plattsburgh, it still maintains the 10-megawatt facility in Skyway Plaza.  In 2019, Coinmint was evicted from one of its facilities in the Imperial Mill industrial park for unknown reasons. Doug Butdorf, the property manager of the park, declined to comment on either Coinmint’s eviction or the space’s two current mining tenants, including Zafra (the identity of the second mining operation is also unknown).  Zafra, Plattsburgh’s second-biggest operation, however, worked to comply with the city’s new rules, and when the moratorium was lifted, it expanded its presence in the city.     After Coinmint’s eviction, Zafra took over its location at Imperial Mill and has been working on a buildout of a 2-megawatt mining operation. Zafra runs a hosting business in another unit in the industrial park.  Zafra has a handful of employees, including CEO Brienza’s father, a local businessman and engineer, and Brienza’s high school friend (at 22, Brienza is a recent graduate of Beekmantown High School, just outside Plattsburgh).  The economic impact of crypto mining farms  Though both Coinmint and Zafra have employees in Plattsburgh, the mining operations have created far fewer jobs than the city’s government would like to see.  Mining operations often tout job creation as a benefit to the community before they set up shop, but both Read and Christopher Rosenquest, the current mayor of Plattsburgh, said the gains have been minimal at best.  “For better or for worse, they don’t create a lot of jobs,” Rosenquest told CoinDesk. “We track these companies, we know who they are. We know that there’s only one or three jobs created after the build-out [of the mining facility].”  And the jobs that are created are often low-skill, low-wage security jobs, said Read, which means that they produce little tax benefit to the community.  “Mostly young kids work for them, at minimum wage, so they’re not buying houses and paying property taxes, and they can’t really afford to live on the wages that bitcoin [mining operations] pay, and there’s no income tax,” Read said. “There’s really no way to tax them.”  And because miners are highly sensitive to the price of electricity, as well as to the ease of doing business, they keep their operations as mobile as possible, often in shipping containers, like Coinmint. That means they don’t buy warehouse space, they rent it, and so cities like Plattsburgh don’t reap the benefit in property taxes, either.  “We don’t get property tax from crypto miners, we get it from their landlords. We don’t get sales tax from crypto miners, because they’re not selling a product. There’s no tax benefit or tax revenue we generate from that industry. We don’t get any money from them,” Rosenquest explained.  Crypto mining vs. plastics and weed  Other industries that consume the same amount of power as Plattsburgh’s crypto miners create many more jobs. Read told CoinDesk that for each megawatt of power, economic planners typically expect to see 55 jobs created.  Mold-Rite Plastics, for example, which is the second-biggest user of Plattsburgh’s power at 5 megawatts per month, has about 450 employees. Read said Coinmint has fewer than 10.  Rosenquest told CoinDesk the biggest benefit to having the miners in town is the ability to sell the city’s excess power.  “Look, if we’re allotted a certain amount [of power], and we only use 90% of that, that’s money left on the table, right? Having some type of industry that consumes the rest of that electricity is our goal,” Rosenquest said.  The mayor, however, is also concerned that by selling the totality of the city’s power each month, Plattsburgh could be missing out on a better option in the future.  “The city of Plattsburgh is very pro-adult recreational marijuana. [Growers] use as much, maybe slightly less, electricity than a miner of the size we have,” Rosenquest said.  “But a large-scale marijuana grower and manufacturer would create a significant amount more jobs, right? They would consume the same amount of electricity but provide a lot more benefit to the city by creating jobs,” he added.  Happy ending?  When asked whether Rider A was ultimately effective in protecting residential ratepayers, both Read and Rosenquest told CoinDesk that there were no more complaints of sky-high electricity bills.  But, when CoinDesk talked to Plattsburgh locals, the truth appeared to be more complicated.  Jeremy Frenyea, an IT specialist for the local school district and a small business owner, told CoinDesk that while the passage of Rider A kept his bills from rising astronomically, the monthly cost is still more than it used to be before the miners moved into town.  Frenyea is a co-owner of Medusa Gaming, a board game shop, and says the store’s electricity costs each month are still up considerably from what they were before. Frenyea said Medusa is open only five days a week for four to five hours a day. The only significant power draw in the shop, aside from the lights, is a fridge storing cold sodas for sale.  “Our average bill prior to the bitcoin farms was between $14 and $50 per month. Now we’re up to $200-plus a month. So that’s been wonderful,” Frenyea said sarcastically.  Despite his frustrations with the mining industry’s impact on his life, Frenyea said he isn’t against cryptocurrency.  “I don’t mind crypto. I think it’s fine,” he said. “But the impact is a little rough on the communities that are hosting it.”  UPDATE (March 21, 20:30 UTC): Corrects high school's name.  UPDATE (March 21, 21:50 UTC): An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Zafra employed a former Coinmint employee.

EIP-1559 Has Burned 2 Million Ethereum According to Watch the Burn, a platform monitoring the burn mechanism, the network has destroyed a total of 2,000,996 Ethereum which means more than $5.82 billion has been removed from circulation forever. Since Ethereum upgraded to London hardfork last year, the total supply of ETH has faced deflationary pressure via a fee burning proposal known as EIP-1559 that burns a portion of the gas fee with every Ethereum transaction. EIP-1559 was devised to adjust Ethereum&apos;s fee market as Ethereum gas fees previously adopted an auction system that made transaction costs unpredictable. With EIP-1559, Ethereum users pay a minimum fee for transactions known as the &apos;base fee,&apos; and they can add an optional tip to miners to get their transaction through faster during periods of high congestion. Shifting to Proof-of-Stake Ethereum is also inching towards its most comprehensive upgrade yet that will shift the network away from its proof-of-work something that Bitcoin also uses to validate transactions, to a different model called proof-of-stake (PoS). The latter mechanism is more environmentally-friendly as it demands less computing power to achieve comparable levels of security.The post Over Two Million Ethereum Burned Since EIP-1559 Launch appeared first on Cryptoknowmics-Crypto News and Media Platform.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | FORKS,,0,0,Cryptoknowmics,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/over-two-million-ethereum-burned-since-eip-1559-launch/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png

The rise of P2E was a godsend for many, because in the Philippines its gross domestic product declined 9.6% in 2020, its biggest drop in more than 70 years, according to a study by IHS Markit. With so many Filipinos finding themselves out of work, thousands flocked to P2E games. Axie Infinity&apos;s team reported in March 2020 that more than 29,000 new players from the Philippines signed up to the game, out of 70,000 new sign-ups worldwide in the same month. Those players were signing up because Axie Infinity, and other P2E games offer them a chance to earn a viable income simply from playing and completing achievements.

Yet, not everything that&apos;s connected to this product is falling into a favorable light in the media.

42434966,tCVH4TQcT7YFJO3hckPQDW,1647859918,Traders Bet on Ether Staking After Ethereum 2.0 Upgrade,"After enduring weeks of macroeconomic-driven nervousness, crypto traders are focusing on progress within the crypto ecosystem, particularly on smart contract blockchain Ethereum's impending proof-of-stake merge and the bullish implications for its native token, ether (ETH).  ""I am very bullish on ether for the summer as ether staking would offer returns better than real or inflation-adjusted yields in traditional markets after the merge,"" Alex Kruger, a trader and analyst, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.  Last week, Ethereum developers successfully tested the long-awaited merge of the programmable blockchain's proof-of-work and proof-of-stake chains, dubbed Eth 2.0, which will allow users to hold coins in a cryptocurrency wallet to support network operations in return for newly minted coins. Thus, staking is analogous to passive investing.  According to Kruger, ether staking yields are likely to be in the range of 10% to 15%. Blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock expects the yields to be higher than the U.S. consumer price index, which stood at a four-decade high of 7.9% in February.  ""Through the merge with the proof-of-stake chain, fees previously earned by miners will pass on to being earned by those staking. This is expected to result in staking rewards between 7% and 12%,"" IntoTheBlock said in its weekly newsletter published on Friday.  Investors are likely to prefer any asset or investment strategy offering positive real yields. Most traditional investments are currently yielding negative returns when adjusted for inflation. In crypto, the popular bitcoin cash and carry trade now yields -4.9% in real terms, while depositing ether in the liquid staking protocol Lido yields an inflation-adjusted return of -3.9%.  Eth 2.0 to attract institutions  With the merge test run completed successfully, researchers expect the mainnet launch to happen by the end of June. Observers foresee increased institutional adoption once the Eth 2.0 upgrade is complete.  ""I'm quite optimistic. Estimates for post-merge yield are at 10% and above. Plus, moving to proof-of-stake means it's easier for institutions to adopt it since they don't need to defend the energy consumption part of investment argument associated with bitcoin and proof-of-work coins,"" Ilan Solot, a partner at the Tagus Capital Multi-Strategy Fund, said in a Telegram chat.  The proof-of-stake consensus mechanism is more environmentally friendly than proof-of-work, which rewards miners with tokens for solving complex mathematical puzzles to validate transactions. That process is energy-intensive. Some sources say bitcoin mining has a carbon footprint equivalent to developed nations, which has deterred institutions from adopting the cryptocurrency. The U.S. electric-car maker Tesla suspended bitcoin payments last year, citing environmental concerns associated with mining.  ""The Beacon Chain [deposit contract launched in December 2020] introduced staking but didn't change how Ethereum fundamentally works. That all changes in 2022 when it merges with the mainnet, making the significant consensus change, reducing energy consumption by 99.95% and eliminating a carbon footprint the size of Finland,"" Ruben Merre, CEO of crypto wallet NGRAVE, said in a LinkedIn post.  Over 10 million ether are locked in the deposit contract, CoinDesk reported early this month.  Store of value and scalability  Lastly, the merge is likely to make ether a deflationary, or store-of-value asset, a narrative primarily tied to bitcoin. ""Following the merge, the amount of ETH issued is projected to drop by 90%, which would lead similar levels of fees to reduce ether’s supply by as much as 5% a year,"" IntoTheBlock noted.  Ether's pace of supply expansion has already slowed. The Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP)-1559 implemented in August introduced a mechanism to burn a portion of fees paid to miners. Since then, more than 2 million ETH – worth over $5.78 billion – have been destroyed, leading to a net supply reduction of 65.2%, according to data source Watch the Burn.  Some experts said the sharding upgrade due after the merge will be a more significant bullish catalyst. Sharding refers to splitting the entire Ethereum network into multiple portions called shards to spread the load. The change is designed to ease network congestion and boost transaction speeds.  ""After the merge comes sharding, through which scaling is facilitated,"" Laurent Kssis, a crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) expert and director of CEC Capital, said. ""Will it signal that Ethereum’s status as the dominant Web 3 blockchain is truly deserved and sustainable? The gas fee will not be instantly resolved, in my opinion, as interest could surge and hence gas fee too, but it will be exciting to watch first move advantage and ability to attract developers, there would be less reason for crypto projects to opt for any of Ethereum’s rivals.  ""For me, it’s all about the speed of transactions using shard chains, making it much more energy-efficient and ultimately paying lower fees,"" Kssis added.  Ether rose 13% past week, the biggest gain in seven weeks, CoinDesk data shows. On March 15, more than 180,000 ETH were withdrawn from centralized exchanges, indicating a decline in the number of coins available for sale in the market.  ""Last time such a magnitude of ETH left exchanges was in Oct 2021, preceding a 15% price increase within ten days,"" IntoTheBlock noted in its Telegram channel.  The cryptocurrency was recently trading near $2,900, representing a 1% gain on the day.  Edit (12:32 UTC): Corrects the dollar value of ETH staked in the deposit contract to $5.78 billion.

Then, after a long depression in the KCS market, a new attempt to update the historical high took place in April 2021.

However, 4 months have passed since the update, and sellers still did not dare to counterattack. All attempts by sellers to take control of the market are accompanied by minimal volumes.

It seemed that when there was little hope, the situation instantly changed for the better. A similar scenario worked on the 1INCH cryptocurrency chart. Analyzing the price movement on a weekly timeframe, we can see that buyers showed character for the first time in 5 months. Prior to that, the 1INCH price spinelessly fell to $1.18. Of course, buyers tried to change the situation, but in the weekly timeframe, their initiative was not consolidated. During the week of 14 March, buyers were able to absorb almost three previous ones with one candle. At the same time, trading volumes were slightly increased. Of course, the closing of the weekly candle on 14 March with a fairly large pin indicates a high concentration of sellers in the market. https://www.tradingview.com/x/8qp5Mtd2/ However, the very fact of such a movement authoritatively insists on the idea of ​​changing the initiative in the 1INCH market.

In the previous two cases of the test of this trend line, the 1INCH price jumped sharply at least 100%.

Well, it&apos;s no surprise that gamers are among the first adopters of new technology products and platforms. Whether those products and platforms are crypto-related or not. As gaming NFTs become easier to use, we could see that more and more projects incorporate them into their games as digital items.

They usually refer to a particular person or object rather than interchangeable like traditional cryptocurrencies. For example, an NFT can represent in-game items, characters, digital assets, or trophies in games. Therefore, they have different characteristics from other tokens within a game or platform. While blockchain ledger stores these ERC721 tokens, they are mostly used in closed ecosystems. Rather than as a means of exchange for fiat currency. But things may change soon.
