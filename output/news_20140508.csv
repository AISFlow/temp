42425663,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIeqPh,1399592730,Winklevoss Twins Plan NASDAQ Listing for Bitcoin ETF in New SEC Filing,"A new regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) indicates that Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss are planning to have their Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust exchange traded fund (ETF) listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange.  If the SEC gives its final approval, investors will be able to buy into the fund and participate by owning ""shares"" of bitcoins.  The filing is an amendment to a series of documents that the ETF has submitted to the SEC in order to get the fund off the ground. It was initially registered with the SEC last July.  Math-Based Asset Services  The Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust would be the first publicly-listed bitcoin ETF. The trust is owned by Math-Based Asset Services, LLC, an entity set up by the Winklevoss twins.  According to the SEC filing, the ETF is expected to IPO for 1m total shares. Each share is worth one-fifth of a bitcoin, which would mean that the trust controls 200,000 BTC and at recent prices would be worth roughly $87 per share.  Selling ""shares"" of bitcoin on the open NASDAQ market would provide investors improved access to bitcoin-based assets.  New York City-based SecondMarket operates a bitcoin investment trust. However, that fund is currently restricted to accredited investors.  The Winklevoss brothers, who had an early hand in the conception of Facebook, have been bullish advocates of bitcoin for some time. They indicated last year they expect BTC to hit $40,000 per coin in the future.  Big backers  The Winklevosses revealed their bitcoin investment last year, reportedly owning 1% of all bitcoins in circulation. Based on the digital currency's total market cap, that would mean the twins jointly own over $50m in BTC.  The brothers have been publicly stumping for the positive virtues of the virtual currency industry. They have appeared on CNBC and testified earlier this year in front of the New York Department of Financial Services' hearings on virtual currencies.  The twins are also keynote speakers at Money2020 later this year, which is expected to attract thousands of financial industry attendees.  The SEC has recently issued guidance that warned investors bitcoin:  ""Has the potential to give rise both to frauds and high-risk investment opportunities.”  Nevertheless, the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust continues to make filings with the US government's regulatory body for securities, suggesting its listing on NASDAQ could very well occur at some point in the future.

42397611,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDSLq,1399585532,Singapore’s 8pip to Sell Prepaid Bitcoin Cards at Retailers,"A new pre-loaded bitcoin card launched this week in Singapore, allowing users to buy small amounts of bitcoin and import the value easily into wallet software.  The cards come from Singapore startup 8pip, a subsidiary of CoinPip, in denominations of S$50 and S$100 (S$100 = US$80). Each card has a serial number and private key, which buyers then take to the CardToCoin website and redeem the amount loaded on the card.  It's CoinPip's second new bitcoin venture in a short time, having recently introduced the SMS wallet/payment system developed by US-based 37coins.  The company is also sponsoring the BOOST:Bitcoin events to introduce newcomers to bitcoin. There have been three events in Asia so far: Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur and Singapore itself, where 8pip launched CardToCoin and its cards.  New environments  CoinPip and its partners are gaining a reputation in their quest to find bitcoin payment services outside the 'traditional' smartphone-desktop environment. The key to worldwide bitcoin adoption lies just as much in the developing and emerging markets of the world as elsewhere, perhaps even more so.  People without ready access to banks tend to lack reliable internet connections and the latest consumer technology, so need a way to exchange bitcoins via the devices they have at hand: older mobile phones or something not electronic at all.  For anyone  8pip's cards and the CardToCoin service aren't aimed just at the emerging world, though. Purchasing physical bitcoin value for later import into a wallet is a safe and convenient option for those in the world's most switched-on cities as well.  If you're new to bitcoin, or only looking to acquire bitcoin in small, spendable amounts, the cards are a good way to avoid lengthy verification processes and other hurdles sometimes associated with online exchanges.  Anson Zeall, co-founder of both CoinPip and 8pip, believes CardToCoin will make bitcoin more accessible to the general public and help demystify the idea of bitcoin.    ""At the moment, bitcoin or cryptocurrency exchanges are the most common ways to get bitcoin,"" he said.      ""The problem is, unless you’re a seasoned stock trader, the process to get bitcoin is still very complicated and intimidating. With CardToCoin, for example, you can simply buy a card with S$20 worth of bitcoin and then redeem it online with your tablet, phone or PC.""    Where to buy  8pip says it will release more details about CardToCoin retail partners and future products in the coming months.  CoinPip's more traditional bitcoin app for businesses, CoinPip Merchant was launched on the Google Play store for Android devices in April.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/05/08/singapores-8pip-to-sell-prepaid-bitcoin-cards-at-retailers,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3dde8efeb848f0ddbcb331da70b344f1829e3fa5-640x640.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42397614,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDSPm,1399574413,Dutch Central Bank: Bitcoin 'No Viable Alternative' to Fiat Currency,"The Dutch central bank, De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB), has issued a warning on digital currencies such as bitcoin, saying that they ""are unlikely to become a viable alternative for traditional currency in the foreseeable future"".  Recognising that digital currencies fall outside the bank's scope for regulation, the statement on the DNB website warns:  ""There is also no security in respect of funds received, ie no guarantee that balances will be returned following bankruptcy, and outstanding payments will be executed. No-one monitors whether virtual currency institutions have sound and responsible business operations.""  Measured but negative  Back in December 2013, the former president of the DNB, Nout Wellink, dismissed bitcoin, saying that the “façade” and hype around the currency would eventually fade – likening it to the 'Tulip Mania' of the 17th century.  In April the deputy director of the Dutch Payments Association, while making the same 'Tulip Mania' comparison, claimed digital currencies were technology but not money.  However, this latest statement is more measured, giving an overview of how digital currencies work, including mining, before warning:  ""There is a lot of interest in virtual currencies, owing to their innovative character and their way of challenging the current financial system, but this does not make them a viable alternative for the basic functions of money.""  As with many similar bank warnings, the organisation is concerned about the absence of a central authority overseeing the bitcoin industry, with ""market players in virtual currency systems [providing] only weak security guarantees"".  Theft and compliance  The security of users' funds are also a threat, the bank says, with the spectre of Mt. Gox’s bankruptcy raised as a case in point:  ""[...] virtual currency systems are definitely still falling short where security is concerned. Due to its decentralised set-up, there is no central party in the virtual currency world that has the responsibility to hold market players to account when they fail to comply with conditions for use, security demands, or legal frameworks.""  A further element of the DNB warning is that virtual currencies are still not widely used, due to their disadvantages. Currently, there are less than 1,000 transactions per day in the Netherlands, compared with over 16 million euro payments.  Issues for users  Along with the standard threat of bitcoin's volatility and security problems, the DNB raises doubts about the reliability of the software used in digital currency transactions, saying:  ""The software supporting a virtual currency system may be faulty, meaning that the integrity of transactions cannot be guaranteed.""  One of the attractions of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is that it is extremely cheap to carry out a transaction compared with traditional financial systems, such as international bank transfers.  However, the central bank warns that this will not be the case in the long term and raises the spectre of high fees as bitcoin reaches its built-in production limit:  ""[...] when the majority of the maximum number of 21 million bitcoins will have been created around 2030, transaction processing costs will have to be recovered from transaction fees. The current low fees are then unlikely to be maintained.""  Nothing new  Jelmer Baukema, a lawyer working at Van Doorne NV, Amsterdam, and who specializes in working with digital currencies, said:  ""I think [the bank's statement] will not affect the Dutch bitcoin system, as the DNB did not explicitly express its disapproval against the use of bitcoin. The bank seems, at least for the moment, to be playing down the role of bitcoin in the Dutch economy (rightly or wrongly).""  Baukema said that, besides this official statement, there have been a number of unofficial statements from DNB, saying that it exercises, or will exercise, supervision on companies that conduct bitcoin-related activities (such as 'third-party bitcoin services') where, for example, fiat currencies are being held on behalf of third parties.  In addition, he said, the DNB may be planning an official report on bitcoin in the near future.  ""In general, this DNB statement on bitcoin is very limited and its contents do not provide new insights on how bitcoin related activities are, or will be, regulated or supervised in the Netherlands,"" Baukema concluded.  Bitcoin economy thriving  Despite the less-than-positive signals from the Netherlands' banking world, bitcoin is seeing something of a boom in the country, with the Bitcoin 2014 Conference scheduled to take place in Amsterdam next week.  In March, CoinDesk reported how 10 Dutch businesses lining two canal-side streets took the collective decision to band together to accept bitcoin, becoming the country's first 'Bitcoin Boulevard'.  Furthermore, Hollands’ biggest food delivery network now accepts bitcoin, as does one of the country's high-profile lawyers. Dutch bitcoiners can even book a helicopter flight with digital currency, too.

42397600,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDSDy,1399570810,Mt. Gox Revival Plan Granted Preliminary Nod of Approval,"The proposed plan to revive bankrupt Japan-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox has received a key preliminary nod of approval.  The news comes roughly one week after an initial hearing delayed any decision at the request of lawyers representing Tibanne KK and Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles.  Jay Edelson, a US lawyer representing the country's domestic exchange users, indicated that the plan was approved in a Northern District of Illinois court, and that this move clears the way for it to be more formally vetted in Japan.  Edelson told CoinDesk:  ""The court granted our motion for preliminary approval of our settlement and certified our settlement class. We will now take it to Japan and seek approval from the Japanese Administrator.""  The proposal, submitted jointly by the legal representation of the exchange's international users, would find the class settling its claims against former Mt. Gox chief marketing officer Gonzague Gay-Bouchery and equity stakeholder Jed McCaleb.  In addition, Sunlot Holdings, the investor group that has placed a 1 BTC bid to buy the troubled exchange, would purchase the exchange and its related liabilities and provide former users with a 16.5% equity stake in the new operation.  Next steps  Though this development is important to the eventual approval of the deal, the final say regarding the sale of the exchange and the settlement against the defendants still lies with the Japanese courts.  More recently, Mt. Gox's Japanese bankruptcy trustee Nobuaki Kobayashi told The Wall Street Journal that he is still seeking the necessary authority to approve such a plan, and that he will need more clarity as to the state of Mt. Gox's Chapter 15 bankruptcy filing in the US to do so.  However, the next hearing in this part of the case is not set until 17th June, meaning it could be one month before the proposal is allowed an opportunity to move forward.

42397606,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDSIt,1399567360,US Government Taps Nonprofit to Research Digital Currency Crime,"The US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has announced it will award the National Cyber-Forensic Training Alliance (NCFTA), a cybersecurity nonprofit organization, with a contract to research crimes involving digital currencies.  The one-year sole source order, published yesterday on behalf of the US Treasury Department, the Office of Illicit Finance (OIF) and the Office of Intelligence and Analysis (OIA), establishes that the NCFTA would study virtual currency and virtual currency exchanges to provide the federal government with real-time cyber threat intelligence.  In a redacted justification document, the US government states its need for broader capabilities in tracking crimes involving digital currencies.  The document reads:  “[The NCFTA] will support OIF’s efforts to identify significant cybercriminals engaged in financial crimes, as well as initiatives that highlight virtual currencies and virtual currency exchangers that service criminal clientele.”  The order justification goes on to cite NCFTA’s existing infrastructure and access to private information. It is not clear how much the one-year contract award is worth.  CoinDesk reached out to the IRS for comment but did not receive a response.  About the NCFTA  On its website, the NCFTA calls itself “a non-profit corporation focused on identifying, mitigating, and ultimately neutralizing cyber crime threats through strategic alliances and partnerships”.    The organization was founded in 1997 by Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Carnegie Mellon's Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) and the National White Collar Crime Center.    The NCFTA was one of several organizations to join a cybersecurity trade coalition founded in the wake of the Target customer data breach scandal in early 2014. The non-profit is also involved with other projects targeting malware and digital consumer protection standards.  CoinDesk has reached out to the IRS primary point of contact on the filing, but at press time, has not received a response.

42397607,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDSHu,1399563335,FEC Approves Bitcoin In-Kind Donations for US Political Campaigns,"The US Federal Election Commission (FEC) has determined that political campaigns and political action committees (PACs) may accept bitcoin as a form of in-kind donation under current federal election laws.  The FEC previously delayed a decision on a request for clarification from Make Your Laws (MYL) – an organisation that facilitates political contributions – which sought guidance on how it could go about accepting and using bitcoin donations, as well as general rules for handling digital currencies.  In its draft report, the FEC tracks closely with comments made previously by the commission's leadership regarding the potential for bitcoin to be qualified as a type of in-kind donation.  The decision mirrors a proposal dating from November 2013, when the FEC explored the idea of treating bitcoin donations as in-kind contributions.  In the report, the commission wrote:  “The initial receipt of bitcoins as contributions, regardless of subsequent disposition, should be reported like in-kind contributions.”  Bitcoins use for campaigns  Under US law, most campaign contributions must be deposited into a campaign bank depository 10 days after receipt.  In the case of stocks, bonds or pieces of artwork, however, a campaign or action committee may hold that asset for longer than 10 days. Once that asset is liquidated, the proceeds must then be placed into a campaign depository. The same applies for digital currency:  “Like securities that a political committee may receive into and hold in a brokerage account, bitcoins may be received into and held in a bitcoin wallet until the committee liquidates them.”  The FEC also determined that campaigns are required to adhere to existing guidelines for reporting the receipt or sale of bitcoins. This includes collecting personal information from any donor.  MYL also sought guidance on the sale and disbursements of bitcoins. The FEC concluded that, according to US federal election laws, a campaign or PAC may purchase bitcoins for the purpose of investment, but that they cannot be disbursed from the organization. Disbursement can only take place if the bitcoins are sold and the proceeds are placed in a campaign depository.  Bitcoin donations increasing  The FEC decision was not unexpected, as several political campaigns in the US have moved to accept bitcoin contributions.  Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott started taking bitcoin donations in April and his campaign has been treating these contributions as in-kind, according to state and federal law.  Other federal lawmakers, such as Representative Steve Stockman, have also welcomed bitcoin donations.  Uncertainty prior to the FEC’s release has resulted in some state-based election regulators to postpone their own decisions on bitcoin donations.  Earlier this week, a Wisconsin alderman running for state office returned a $100 bitcoin donation after the Government Accountability Board opted to not set a policy on the matter before the FEC could weigh in.

In a recent blog post, the company outlined some issues with traditional payment methods and pointed out that bank transfer-related issues account for over 25% of help requests from its customers. Therefore the company started exploring alternative payments options and decided BPAY was the best solution.  As a result, CoinJar will be switching to BPAY for all Filler deposits from Saturday, 10th May, it said, explaining:  “Using your BPAY Customer Reference Number and our Biller Code, you’ll be able to recharge your Filler in a few simple clicks from any mobile or Internet banking app. If your banking provider supports it, you’ll even be able to schedule regular deposits to recharge your Filler.”  Minimal disruption  The switch is scheduled for 4.00pm Melbourne time (BST +9) and a brief maintenance window is scheduled for the same morning. Service disruptions should be minimal, CoinJar said, however users need to prepare for the transition.  In order to make BPAY deposits, users do need to have verified their identity. That being the case, the whole process will be fast-tracked by the company's support team.  Any user who do not wish to reveal or verify their identity will still be able to use CoinJar to send and receive bitcoins.  The company further points out that, from Saturday, it will be a BPAY-exclusive system, and users will no longer be able to make over-the-counter cash deposits or transfer funds to CoinJar's previous National Australia Bank (NAB) accounts.  In early April, the NAB announced it will no longer work with bitcoin-related companies due to ""an unacceptable level of risk"".  The system for withdrawing funds remains unchanged, CoinJar said.  Using unique BPAY IDs  Once the switch takes place, each CoinJar user will be assigned a unique BPAY reference ID that will be created when the user attempts to create a new Filler deposit after the switchover.  Once they receive the new ID, users will be able to use it to through online banking services simply by choosing the ‘Pay with BPAY’ option.  The company gives the following simple step-by-step guide to the process:  “Enter CoinJar's BPAY Biller Code and your CoinJar Account's Reference ID, along with the amount you wish to transfer to Filler. Click 'Send' and you're all done! Your deposit will reach CoinJar within 1-3 business days and, provided all the details have been entered correctly, will automatically be added to your Filler balance.”  The company encourages users to get acquainted with BPAY ahead of time and get in touch with CoinJar customer support in case they require any additional information.

42397613,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDSOn,1399554021,Avalara Launches Bitcoin Module for Tax Compliance Engine,"Avalara has today added a bitcoin module to its AvaTax compliance engine.  The company is one of the leading providers of cloud-based compliance solutions focused on sales tax and other transactional taxes.  The first and only service provider to offer bitcoin functionality in a tax compliance platform, Avalara hopes the addition of bitcoin support will allow retailers, digital currency processors and wallet services to calculate sales tax and value added tax (VAT) in real-time.  History of sticky compliance issues  Avalara senior director Webb Stevens said the company has a history of researching and addressing ‘sticky’ compliance issues from the get-go. He added:  “Whether it’s preparing merchants to quickly address the litany of sales tax holidays or helping businesses run entirely on bitcoin, Avalara works hard [...] The ability to process sales tax for bitcoin transactions is one of the final, necessary steps to support bitcoin-driven business models – and the latest example of our forward-thinking approach.”  Avalara’s reasoning is simple: bitcoin has been growing in popularity for months and point-of-sale applications and other payment technologies are evolving to handle bitcoin transactions. However, compliance platforms have not been forthcoming, at least not yet.  Merchants need all the support they can get  Avalara points out that merchants are drawn to bitcoin as it has the potential to reduce or completely eliminate currency conversion fees, credit card fees and even fraud.  One of the problems faced by merchants willing to consider bitcoin is industry compliance. Regulatory ambiguity has resulted in a legal vacuum of sorts, hence many tax issues need to be addressed.  In some jurisdictions the simple act of collecting and filing sales tax or VAT can prove problematic for merchants dealing with bitcoin transactions. Stevens added:  “With many online business processing millions of transactions per day, it’s critical that they get accurate and compliant sales tax rates for every transaction.”  “Avalara intends to innovate in the handling of cryptocurrencies, just as have in handling tax and compliance issues for virtual goods, digital services and highly mobile location-based transactions.”  In essence, Avalara is trying to tap an emerging niche that didn't even exist a few years back.  A growing number of merchants are looking into bitcoin payments and many of them need an established player to handle any tax compliance issues that may emerge down the road.

The company’s hirings are significant: a senior manager at PayPal and an analyst fresh from a long stint at SecondMarket, the online marketplace for trading illiquid assets and parent company of the Bitcoin Investment Trust.  Together they bring expertise from the mainstream payments industry and other sections of the bitcoin economy to the young Asian exchange.  Erik Wilgenhof Plante  The first new hire is Erik Wilgenhof Plante, who takes on the newly created position of chief compliance officer.  Wilgenhof Plante was previously responsible for compliance at PayPal across Southeast Asia, and has 15 years' total experience in law and banking at companies like DZ Privatbank, Clariden Leu, Commerzbank and ABN AMRO.  He is also network chairman and fellow of the International Compliance Association, a Financial Industry Certified Professional, and a founding board member of the Singapore chapter of the Association of Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialists.  Writing on the company blog, Wilgenhof Plante said that building trust was key to success with both institutional and retail investors and this was itBit's key focus:  ""itBit was created with compliance, security and customer experience at its core. With this long-term vision, we believe that we will be able to build the trust needed to be successful.""  Defending bitcoin  Wilgenhof Plante noted that itBit was part of the ""second wave"" of bitcoin companies in a defence of bitcoin in this recent Bloomberg interview, in which the interviewer John Dawson claimed bitcoin faces ""a tidal wave of concern from the public"" due to past scandals, including Mt. Gox.  ""With trust comes regulation, as it's very hard to create this trust,"" he said, continuing:  ""Once regulators come out with proper and pragmatic regulation, we will see an upsurge no doubt. We have a professional team, all ex-bankers [...] we take this seriously, we take our customers seriously. We want to protect them, we want to have a secure environment, and we want to be regulated.""  He gave Singapore as an example of one country where such desirable regulation was being investigated. Bitcoin would not replace the financial industry, he said, but needed to connect with it all the same.  Bobby Cho  The second new hire is Bobby Cho, who will be a New York-based director focused on business development.  Cho was at SecondMarket for six years as a trader in illiquid financial products including bitcoin. In addition, he is active on the bitcoin scene and a regular on the speaker circuit.  itBit CEO and co-founder Rich Teo commented:  ""Bobby is a well-known figure in the bitcoin industry and we are excited to gain his talents and insights.""  “Coming from a traditional Wall Street environment, I see the huge opportunity for a credible, regulated bitcoin exchange to make a significant impact on the growth of the bitcoin ecosystem,” added Cho.  Company image  As a bitcoin exchange, itBit's gaze has always been directed mainly towards the financial industry, with high net worth and institutional investors its primary target customers. To attract these customers it has maintained an emphasis on regulation and security.  The exchange recently announced it would ""soak up"" international bank transfer fees at the Singapore end on incoming transfers over $2,500, for its customers outside Singapore (who also tend to be the larger investors). About 50% of its clientele is based in Singapore, where local bank transfers are free.  Disclaimer: CoinDesk founder Shakil Khan is an investor in SecondMarket.

42397618,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDSTi,1399542994,How Bitcoin's Technology Could Revolutionize Intellectual Property Rights,"The bitcoin block chain is well known for its use as a ledger for digital currency transactions, but it has the potential for other, more radical uses too – uses that are only now beginning to be explored.  The online service Proof of Existence is an example of how the power of this new technology can have applications far beyond the world of finance, in this case, giving a glimpse of how bitcoin could one day have a substantial impact in the fields of intellectual property and law.  Although in its initial stages, Proof of Existence can be used to demonstrate document ownership without revealing the information it contains, and to provide proof that a document was authored at a particular time.  Manuel Aráoz, a Buenos Aires, Argentina-based developer, who built Proof of Existence as a decentralized method of verification, a kind of cryptographic notary service explained:  ""As the block chain is a public database, it is a distributed sort of consensus, your document becomes certified in a distributed sort of way.""  While the prospect of the block chain providing key evidence in legal disputes may seem far-fetched today, such a leap in thinking is akin to the work being done by developers of digital currency projects around the globe.  As projects like OneName and BitID are proving, decentralized, digital verification is a concept that many proponents of distributed systems see as a natural, if as-yet-untapped, application of the technology.  How it works  Proof of Existence  allows users to upload a file and pay a transaction fee to have a cryptographic proof of it included on the bitcoin block chain. The actual file is not stored online and therefore does not risk unwanted publication of the user's material.  After anonymously uploading the document and paying the network fee, a hash of the document (or any other type of digital file) is generated as part of the transaction.  This, in effect, uses the public and ledger-like nature of the block chain to store the proof of your file, which can later be verified should an issue of authorship or dating arise.  ""Basically, by inserting the cryptographic hash of the document in a transaction, when that transaction is mined into a block, the block timestamp becomes the document’s timestamp,"" said Aráoz.  As well as time-stamping, Proof of Existence is also a way to make sure that files are what they are supposed to be.  As Proof of Existence says: ""All we store is a cryptographic digest of the file, linked to the time in which you submitted the document. In this way, you can later certify that the data existed at that time.""  Developers, for example, can use the service to later verify versions of their code, inventors can prove they had an idea at a certain time and authors can protect their works.  And this is can be verified via the hash generated during a block chain transaction, said Aráoz:  ""You put the hash next to the download link and check the hash yourself. If someone compromises your server, a hacker cannot modify that.""  No-output transactions  Aráoz indicated that there are a number of potential applications for the service given its ability to prove that a document or piece of code was verified at a point in time and that the bitcoin ledger is perfectly designed for the task.  Effectively, the scripting capabilities that exist within bitcoin's block chain allow for transactions to have no output. This means that, while a small amount of bitcoin goes into the system (currently a 0.0001 BTC fee for miners to confirm the transaction within a block), no BTC needs to be sent to a recipient.  Hence, the block chain has the built-in functionality to incentivize miners to carry out the necessary hashing to verify a document.  This functionality is key to utilizing the block chain for reasons other than just moving BTC, and it is clear that this no-output design has potential to power innovative ideas beyond just virtual money.  Protecting digital property  Given this potential, it's possible that the implications of solutions like Proof of Existence might be even more valuable than the per-bitcoin price many investors are fixated upon today.  Digital property can sometimes also be considered intellectual property, and block chain technologies could essentially prove ownership of such digital property, according to Aráoz, who explained:  ""For example, if you are writing a paper or you have an idea for a patent, in some cases you need to prove that you owned the idea or the paper before someone else.""  Verification is example of the block chain's potential outside of just monetary innovation.  That's something venture capitalist Fred Wilson is interested in, and recently said:  “Right now you need someone to be the arbiter of identity – either Facebook, Twitter or Google [...] I think you could do the same thing with a block chain architecture.""  The block chain could help to better prove digital identity and property, giving people more ownership of personal data.  Companies like Google, for example, promote the ability for users to control data from its services. Facebook recently added the option to login to services anonymously to reduce the possibility of user data being spread out among third-party applications.  However, the fact of the matter remains, those services are centralized and always will be, while block chain technologies are better suited for distributed cryptographic trust systems.  Legal backing needed  The question raised by the service, however, is how quickly institutions such as the US legal system will adopt this new type of public validation and identity.  Given that the implications of bitcoin in the world of finance are difficult for many to comprehend, realizing the power that the block chain holds as a record of fact might be even harder. Aráoz understands this is currently an issue and said:  ""So you can either pay for a notary, or you can use Proof of Existence. In practice, [the block chain] proves it. The thing is, it is not yet widespread enough so that it can hold [up] in court.""  However, all it would take for acceptance is a favourable ruling in one case where the block chain certifies that something happened at a particular time.  When (or if) that happens, it might allow bitcoin's general ledger to be used as a mainstream method of verifying document authorship and contents or software versioning.  Court rulings in the US have made headway in making bitcoin as a currency more tangible, at least from a legal standpoint.  Last year, a Texas Court ruled that bitcoin is a form of money, which then gave the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) the means to justifiably prosecute a man in a purported bitcoin-based Ponzi scheme.  There will be more court rulings like this, and if courts around the world start to look favourably on distributed systems like bitcoin that can offer undeniable verification of existence, that will ultimately validate this concept as something that has real-world and mainstream applications.
