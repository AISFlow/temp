42399241,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbif9K,1470520865,"Amid Blockchain Hype, Is There Still a Place for Litecoin?","Once heralded as the ""silver to bitcoin's gold"", the developers behind the long-running digital currency litecoin are seeking to reestablish the project's prior position as the world's second most popular cryptocurrency.  Breaking a long lull in project announcements, litecoin’s core developers and the Litecoin Associationhttps://litecoinassociation.org/blog.html, a Texas-based non-profit advocacy group for the technology, revealed a new roadmap earlier this summer. Far from a dramatic change in course, it seeks to reinvigorate a project originally launched as an online payment option meant to be faster and more enticing for global merchants.  But despite early success as a complement to bitcoin for investors and traders, the project has arguably fallen behind as the blockchain technology underlying bitcoin has increasingly become the focus of institutions and former bitcoin startups.  However, the team behind the project used the announcement to double down on its prior market positioning, introducing a number of updates that sought to showcase it is focused on transaction speed, scaling, merchant support and mobile wallets.  With the project unencumbered by the byzantine nature of bitcoin's mammoth governance structure, some in the community believe it could come to implement changes quicker than the world's most popular digital currency, thus giving it a key competitive advantage.  Competition emerges  Still, the roadmap release comes at a time that could viewed as a defining moment for litecoin, one that in many ways finds it grappling with changes in how digital currencies are being perceived amid heightened institutional interest.  At a time when many in the industry are eager for technological innovation, litecoin’s success has historically been the strength of its market capitalization, and its perception as a useful hedge for investors who wanted relief from the sometimes more volatile bitcoin network.  For example, litecoin is one of only a handful of digital currency networks to reach a market cap of $225m, and it has historically held a number-two position ahead of many hundreds of competing alternatives.  In some ways, litecoin could be viewed as having a similar hold on its position as bitcoin. Even as litecoin's market cap and price dropped from its lofty heights in late 2013, it has still consistently led the rest of the pack.  However, the arrival of the blockchain network ethereum, and its token, ether, has called this value proposition into question.  Lauded for innovations in blockchain technology including smart contracts and praised by an increasing number of financial incumbents, the value of ethereum’s native token, ether, has not only surpassed litecoin’s current value, but also its 2013 peak.  Key to ethereum’s success has been that it has a unique value proposition in that it’s primary use is not as a digital currency, but as a resource meant for powering blockchain-based decentralized applications on its network.  Taking on ethereum  But, price isn’t everything, and faster is not always better.  Being ""silver to bitcoin's gold"" may be less than exciting sales pitch in today's environment, where bombastic proclamations of world-changing tech are the norm, but it points to the reliability that has long centered the project.  In many ways, the failure of The DAO and the ethereum fork have vindicated litecoin's steady approach, even as interest in ethereum continues to rise. Further, litecoin has so far resisted the temptation to announce any game-changing features that would find it following in that ethereum's footsteps, despite pressures to do so.  ""Litecoin is trying to do something different than ethereum,"" litecoin founder Charlie Lee told CoinDesk.  He added:  ""Its focus is as a payment method alongside bitcoin. That is not to say assets and other features could come along eventually, just like they may for bitcoin, but we won’t sacrifice security or usability for it.""  Instead, its contributors have been quietly fixing bugs, implementing preventative spam transaction measures and hoping that if bitcoin's blocks become full, it can catch some of that overflow and ride it to a new golden era for the project.  Andrew Vegetabile, board member of the Litecoin Association, attested to this steady approach and unity of vision.  ""For litecoin, the core developers along with the Litecoin Association, have always pushed for an alternate payment method to fiat as litecoin's main focus,"" he said.  Vegetabile told CoinDesk:  ""Sure, we can add additional functionality on layers on top of Litecoin Core, but the primary focus is payment method and providing a solid foundation for additional applications.""  Litecoin as a complement  Litecoin's goal isn’t to replace bitcoin, but to find niches that it excels at and take advantage of those to carve out new market space.  Currently, bitcoin is accepted by more merchants, but there are scenarios where litecoin's enthusiasts believe it could emerge as the leader. For example, some enthusiasts believe bitcoin's long-simmering block size debate could reduce the currency's speed, making litecoin more useful.  ""If bitcoin were to limit blocks and the chains become so crippled with unprocessed transactions,"" explained Vegetabile, ""then it's certainly a possibility we will see an explosion of usage of litecoin.""  Still, others see this scenario as far-fetched.  Jim Harper, a fellow at the CATO institute and former member of the Bitcoin Foundation board, believes that bitcoin is perhaps too big to fail, and that any issues with the larger, more well-known network wouldn’t benefit litecoin.  Harper told CoinDesk:  ""If bitcoin appears broken, I think ordinary people will assume that digital currency is broken. Consumers probably won’t make the subtle judgments among digital currencies that we in the community can.""  The key, according to Lee, isn't bitcoin failing but simply being different.  Lee argues that a faster blockchain could make litecoin more competitive, as should bitcoin chose not to increase its block size, transactions could become slower and more costly.  The solution, according to Lee, could be that multiple cryptocurrency networks simply evolve to serve these different needs.  ""If you are buying a house, you probably want to use the most secure system, regardless of fees. But if you are buying a coffee, you probably don’t want additional fees, and you want it to settle quickly,"" he said, adding:  ""In that case, speed and usability may be more important than the network’s total hashing power.""  Co-dependent future  In some ways, litecoin's future is, like its tagline, dependent on bitcoin.  As such, there is less of a competition between the two projects than a realization, at least in the litecoin community, that a rising tide could lift all boats.  As different blockchain protocols vie for market position, litecoin’s best bet may be to wait it out and see which niches open up. After all, it remains unclear exactly how bitcoin will be used, and it if it will support other blockchains through innovations like sidechains.  Today, both are aiming to serve as payment rails and currencies, but they are also well suited to pivot elsewhere if the opportunity presents itself.  In this way, it’s not hard to foresee a certain blockchain handling remittance, another consumer spending and still others facilitating roles in other niches.  An argument can be made that alternative protocols are all waiting to see which niche bitcoin leaves open.  Vegetable concluded:  ""I personally believe that litecoin's best chance of success is for bitcoin to succeed.""

42426999,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJyODh,1470503583,The Theory of a Blockchain Circular Economy,"William Mougayar is the author of ""The Business Blockchain"", and a board advisor to the Ethereum Foundation, the non-profit that oversees the development of one of two blockchains seeking to popularize the software.  In this opinion piece, Mougayar offers his thoughts on the how blockchains and digital currency could change the way we work and how we are compensated.    We are in the early stages of a new chapter in the nature of work. The blockchain will enable us to do our jobs and be compensated inside new circular economies that have their own currency units and their own work units.  This, I believe, is one of the greatest themes to emerge from blockchain technology.  Most work today is compensated via bilateral agreements between a worker and an employer according to a simple contract: you work in X job, and we will compensate you in Y currency.  But what if we had greater autonomy over how we choose our own work? With more control, we would then be able to perform new types of tasks that may or may not resemble what is traditionally considered labor, and earn cryptocurrency instead of fiat currency.  As a result, instead of doing one job we could hold several paying jobs that are diversified, while not being tied down by the constraints of a single employer.  Already, a number of blockchain based businesses are compensating users for their 'work' via digital tokens.  Steemit  for example, rewards users who vote-up or write posts on its decentralized content platform.  The theory of decentralized transportation platform La’Zooz is that you earn Zooz points, just by driving your car while the app collects data about your driving patterns.  A healthcare research entity could pay patients or normal people who share their medical data, in exchange for the collective wisdom that is gained by aggregating that information, and returning personalized or comparative insights.  At the heart of making this possible, is the relationship between actual work done, value created, and value received.  Let us dissect what is happening here:  Users perform some work, either passive (driving and sharing data), or active (voting a post, or making a decision).  Each marketplace has its own 'unit of work', consisting of a variety of activities.  Each unit of work generates value for the marketplace, for other users and for the end-user themselves. This is an expansion of the network effect theory where each user’s actions benefits other users.  In return for that value, users are rewarded with a native token currency, the marketplace’s own currency.  That currency can be spent inside the marketplace on another transaction or service (eg taking a ride, promoting content), or it can be exchanged outside the marketplace against another cryptocurrency or fiat money.  The value of the marketplace as a whole increases proportionally with the amount of activity and value that are generated inside of it.  A new system of work  There is a new system of work that is unfolding, and blockchains are enabling it.  This is not a Ponzi scheme, but rather a new way to generate economic value. Of course, some companies will try to abuse this system, but others that have thought carefully about its mechanics and operations will benefit and enable their users to also partake in their success via the sharing of network equity.  The most important elements that have to be done right are:  the work being done must be varied  work being done must be valuable and valued  users should be able to spend their earned currency internally in order to generate more value.  What is happening here is the creation of mini circular economies that are self-contained. Some of these models will be created by new companies, while others will be spun out of existing companies.  The models coming out of existing companies will be interesting to watch because most companies and their users create an excess of value that is not well captured. Linking the critical elements together as depicted in my diagram would give a new life to a new economic model.  Could this be the future of work and wealth creation? Possibly.

42426990,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJyNvh,1470488144,Cryptography as a Democratic Weapon Against Demagoguery,"Nozomi Hayase, PhD, is a writer who has been covering issues of freedom of speech, transparency and decentralized movements.  In this opinion piece, Hayase discusses what she asserts is the current disorderly state of US democracy, arguing that the system is rigged, and that efforts to improve it may benefit from a better understanding bitcoin's security model.  America has passed the twilight zone.  The nomination of Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential primary confirmed the charade of US politics. Elections are sold to the highest bidder. No matter how much popular support a candidate like Bernie Sanders might garner, the corporate masters who sponsor this rigged game in the end take all.  Many know that we do not live in a democracy, yet the level of corruption is becoming even more blatantly apparent. Now, the oligarchic class doesn't need to lobby candidates. They can simply run for office, just like Donald Trump.  When essential functions of democracy are disabled and the system has lost its internal safety mechanisms, what can ordinary people do? The success of Bernie Sanders in galvanizing millennials, along with his independent campaign financing, revealed that the people do care and that the issue is not a lack of will for change.  The problem goes much deeper into the very structure of current governance. The fundamental challenge seems to revolve around a lack of true understanding of adversaries and the psychology of those in power.  Most people tend to assume good in others and think they operate with similar motives.  The deep failure of democracy has shaken up these assumptions, showing this to be a naive and overly idealistic view of man. The 2008 financial meltdown and crisis of legitimacy exposed the existence of individuals who have a radically different makeup than the rest of the population. These are psychopaths, whom psychopathy expert Robert Hare called ""social predators who charm, manipulate, and ruthlessly plow their way through life"".  They embody a dark side of man, with aggressive and narrow selfish desires that often come in conflict with the public good. Our innocence about these individuals makes us easy prey.  How can ordinary people effectively resist the agendas of this hidden cannibalistic, two-party duopoly, trying to devour all that is human?  Assange's call for cryptographic defense  The battlefield became visible in 2010, when a little known organization called WikiLeaks came to public limelight with the publication of the Collateral Murder video.  This whistleblowing site began revealing what Julian Assange once described as ""a system of interacting organs, a beast with arteries and veins whose blood may be thickened and slowed until it falls.""  WikiLeaks continues to be effective. From the Turkish ruling party email archive to a database from the DNC, they just released vital documents that shed light on the machinations of governance, which are in many ways holding people hostage.  Assange, who has become a lightning rod for the world’s superpowers through his work of publishing their secrets, has seen the true face of the enemies. In his New York Times Op-Ed, he described the parallel between George Orwell’s time and ours. Assange described Orwell’s prophecy in his 1945 essay ""You and the Atomic Bomb"", about the future of society, noting that when dominant weapons are expensive and complex, society tends to fall into dystopia, and when weapons become cost efficient and simple, they give common people a chance; giving, in Orwell’s words, ‘claws to the weak’.  With this as a context, Assange described the power of math.  ""If there is a modern analogue to Orwell’s ‘simple’ and ‘democratic weapon’,  which 'gives claws to the weak' it is cryptography, the basis for the mathematics behind bitcoin and the best secure communications programs.""  Bitcoin’s underlying technology provides proof of publishing and helps WikiLeaks counteract state censorship. In its seven years of existence, bitcoin has gained wide mainstream attention with its disruptive potential in finance. Yet, currency is only its first application.  Bitcoin’s underlying technology, the blockchain, is a public asset ledger. This is a distributed database that records all history of transactions in a network without anyone in charge. Once data is verified, no one can undo it. The real breakthrough of this invention lies in its immutability and its potential to create a new form of governance that is censorship free and resilient to corruption.  The left's response to this technology has typically been very critical, simply viewing it as money for 'libertarians' or associating it with 'capitalism'. Yet, through an openness to grasp the fundamentals behind this innovation, we may be able to build our own tools to fight against these wolves in sheep’s clothes, who conspire to enact their neoliberal agenda.  Security holes in representative democracy  Bitcoin is built with a keen understanding of adversarial forces.  Instead of naively assuming good intentions in others, the creator of this technology, Satoshi Nakamoto expected that some would try to cheat and attack the network. This assumption is shared by developers who are committed to Satoshi's vision of this particular security model.  At the Hong Kong Scaling Bitcoin conference, developer Andrew Poelstra explained the mindset that bitcoin lives in an adversarial environment and that the possibility of individuals acting selfishly and taking advantage of others' goodwill needs to be factored into designing its governance.  Bitcoin Core developer Peter Todd also emphasized the necessity of adversarial thinking. In a Twitter interaction on the topic of security, Todd noted, ""security isn’t about people promising they won't do something, it’s about people being unable to do something"".  At the core of bitcoin’s development is an acknowledgment that we live in a world where psychopaths exist. So efforts are made to meet this beast within humanity. Psychopaths assault human trust for their predation.  As articulated by psychiatrist Hervey M Cleckley in ""Mask of Sanity"", deception is at the core of psychopathy. These ruthless individuals fake empathy to elicit trust and then exploit it. When a governance model is structured in a manner that relies heavily on trust, such a system inevitably becomes vulnerable to this unknown member of society who can cleverly mimic good attributes of human nature and blend in.  This representative democracy that requires people to trust elected officials has increasingly become a mask used by ruthless individuals behind the scenes to hide and gain a grip on the people.  Bitcoin as a new security model  Bitcoin’s security is designed to offer armory against psychopathic attacks.  In the seminal white paper, creator Satoshi Nakamoto described bitcoin as a purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash that would allow ""online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution"".  Nakamoto stated that it was put forward as a solution to the ""inherent weakness of the trust-based model"", where financial institutions act as trusted third parties.  Author and security expert Andreas Antonopoulos called this new model of security ""trust by computation"" that has ""no central authority or trusted third party"".  He explained this form of trust as follows:  ""Trust does not depend on excluding bad actors, as they cannot 'fake' trust. They cannot pretend to be the trusted party, as there is none. They cannot steal the central keys as there are none. They cannot pull the levers of control at the core of the system, as there is no core and no levers of control.""  With this trust by computation, the need to trust institutions or central authorities is replaced with mathematics. Human trust is easily exploited by those prone to act with little concern for others. In the bitcoin network, where there is no point of control, attackers cannot fake trust. In order to gain control over the network, they would have to compromise math.  Bitcoin’s new security model is embodied in a particular consensus mechanism called proof-of-work. Composed of a combination of cryptographic hash functions, game theory and economic incentives, this proof-of-work facilitates creation of networks that self-regulate and develop their own defense mechanisms against attackers.  The function called mining contributes significantly to this process.  Bitcoin mining is a broadcast math competition engaged by computers around the world with clear rules, such as the total number of bitcoin created, a predictable issuance rate and automatic adjustment of mining difficulty. By using precious resources, miners work to solve difficult math problems.  Each 10 minutes, problems are solved and whoever solves the problem first wins a fixed number of bitcoins. This process leads to both creation of money and validation of transactions and it is designed to create economies of scale, with rewards incentivizing all players to follow the rules of consensus.  Law of self-regulation  As with any system of governance, the question may arise as to how will a network without any authority maintain law and order. How can this math-based network enforce these rules of consensus and fair play?  In traditional systems, psychopaths rise to power, cheat and control the game. In these new cryptographic systems, anti-social forces and psychopathic deception to cheat the system could manifest in anti-network tendencies.  This might be translated into covert chip fabrication, spam attacks or miners colluding in a mining pool to earn more than their fair share.  While most people are bound by empathy and naturally restrain actions in consideration of others’ needs, those who are devoid of conscience are not governed by these internal laws of empathy and therefore cannot regulate self-interests. Before this master manipulator, traditional systems of accountability have shown to be ineffective.  Regulation and laws often fail to restrict their actions or offer protection because this very mechanism has been gutted and used by those in power for their advantage. Moreover, efforts of law enforcement to regulate and punish selfish actors often just make them more cunning, controlling and deceitful.  This bitcoin network governed by proof-of- work rewards those who work honestly and the transparency it provides penetrates deception. There is no shortcut to gain rewards without work. If one wants to be rewarded, they have to solve math problems by using resources and playing by the rules just like everyone else. Under Bitcoin’s rule of consensus, the old tactics of coercion and aggression won’t work.  Robert Wolinsky, senior manager of blockchain research, explains how ""Satoshi introduces a cost equation to cheating and collusion via the proof-of- work protocol"", making it clear to parties what the cost of attacking the network is and having them pay for it upfront.  Furthermore, by making the rewards for playing by the rules higher than the value of attacking the network, it can proactively protect the system from the lack of impulse control of those who are instinctively programmed to act against any network with no remorse.  Bitcoin developer’s approach to security incorporates the attacker's mind into the system.  It is like taking a pathogen in order to strengthen the immune system. Concrete rewards are used to channel self-serving aims and the insatiable hunger for power, turning this energy into generating global level security for all.  Decentralization as collective dissent  Power corrupts, and the best way to check and balance power is to not have these points of control in the first place.  Decentralization disarms those who seek to control us behind a façade of democracy. In a horizontal system, there is no ladder of power that psychopaths can climb to exploit others. Through distributing trust across a network and minimizing the necessity to trust a third party, the system removes vulnerabilities that often lead to concentration of power.  Psychopathic infiltration of society has expanded globally with secret corporate trade deals like the TPP, cycles of merciless austerity and endless wars, creating instability of regions and massive migrant crises. Now the battle for democracy has gone digital. With mass-surveillance and censorship on the Internet, with drones and dissemination of Artificial Intelligence, technology is being used in many ways to make humanity bow down to the tyranny of corporotocracy.  The question of our time is; in whose hands will the future of governance lie? Will it be centralized or decentralized? Will technology be used to enslave humanity or used as a tool for emancipation?  No matter how noble the genius of this consensus algorithm is, by itself it can’t do anything. Encryption technology alone did not create WikiLeaks. It is the network of contagious courage built around this technology that made it truly revolutionary, showing how great power requires the human heart to harness it.  No matter how imperfect the Framers of the US Constitution were, they recognized that ‘We the People’ is a preamble to any legitimate form of governance. In a similar way, a code that carries this same democratic premise needs to be defended and amended whenever necessary by an open network of peers.  Cryptography can become our non-violent democratic weapon. It can be used as a shield for our collective dissent against institutional hierarchies. Elections have become a distraction to pull the wool over our eyes. Now networks of ordinary people, empowered by a deep obligation to one another, can fight against this two-horned beast that would have us all descend into a dystopia.  Only a democracy freely claimed by all people can defeat the rise of demagoguery.  This article originally appeared on Counterpunch and has been republished here with the author's permission.
