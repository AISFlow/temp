42377850,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73oGJ,1417205423,Robocoin Operator Hacks ATM to Run Lamassu Software,"UPDATE (30th November 12:03am GMT): Robocoin's comments have been added.      A former Robocoin operator in the UK has 'hacked' its bitcoin ATM machines to run on software from rival manufacturer Lamassu.  The operator, SatoshiPoint, has installed a system that runs on Lamassu software, bypassing the original Robocoin system. The machine can still buy bitcoin but it has lost its ability to sell bitcoin and dispense fiat currency.  SatoshiPoint's four Robocoin machines were remotely disabled by the manufacturer on 7th November after it refused to use the company's updated operating system. The new operating system requires ATM customers to use a Robocoin wallet system which SatoshiPoint's founders opposed on the grounds that it centralised customer funds.  ""We're not going to just sit there with dead empty hardware. We need to have [the machines] running,"" said Jonathan James Harrison, a SatoshiPoint co-founder.  Robocoin chief executive Jordan Kelley welcomed SatoshiPoint's move, saying that it was a sign of healthy competition in the bitcoin ATM industry.  ""We support the competition – it's great for the market. We're neither upset nor hold a grudge,"" Kelley said.  Kelley added that new Robocoin operators are ""fully aligned"" with his firm's updated operating system. The new system is more stable and has resulted in fewer technical complaints from operators, he said.  Lamassu solution available at a price  SatoshiPoint owns a Lamassu unit in addition to its four Robocoins. Harrison said he had assistance from Lamassu's customer service manager Neal Conner to get the software installed on three of his machines. The final machine will run Lamassu software by the end of next week, he said.  In a video of the new Robocoin machine uploaded to YouTube by Harrison, viewers are told that they can order a hard-drive containing the adapted Lamassu software for their own Robocoin machines for 0.25 BTC. The request must be sent to an account supplied by privacy-centric email provider Hushmail.  ""It's a way for anyone to get hold of this in a simple way,"" Harrison said of the hard-drives for sale.  When asked if the Hushmail account is controlled by SatoshiPoint, Harrison would only say: ""It's not a Satoshipoint email address, is it?""  Lamassu's software is open-source, so it is available for public use. Harrison said that the ATM manufacturer would make the adapted software publicly available as well, although he did not know when it would do so.  Lamassu co-founder Zach Harvey said his firm helped with ""minor issues"" to get its software running on the SatoshiPoint machines. The Lamassu software remains largely unaltered, he said.  Harvey said he hoped operators would contribute to this adaptation of Lamassu software with installation guides and scripts. He also said he believed operators wanted control over their machines, without interference from ATM makers.  ""I believe many operators prefer a greater level of control over machines they bought rather than being controlled by the manufacturer,"" he said.  Harrison said he is working to enable bitcoin-selling on his modified Robocoin machines, again based on existing Lamassu software. SatoshiPoint operates two machines in London, one in Bristol and another in Manchester.  Another modification kit  The adapted Lamassu software running on Harrison's machines is not the only way to modify a Robocoin machine. General Bytes, another manufacturer, sells a 'kit' to bypass Robocoin software for $500. It also only allows bitcoin-buying, although it promises a two-way ATM solution will arrive in February. The only other missing feature with General Bytes is the hand palm scanner, which is due to the technology's expensive licensing.  Harrison launched a campaign against Robocoin's new operating system at the beginning of this month. He called on his fellow operators to turn off their machines to protest Robocoin's move to make the new operating system mandatory. He said he opposed the move because it centralised customer funds.  Robocoin has claimed the update is necessary for operators to comply with anti-money laundering and 'know-your-customer' rules. The Las Vegas-based company was at the centre of a furore over delayed and damaged goods when a disgruntled customer complained publicly on Reddit.

42377847,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73oBH,1417200009,Dutch Supermarket Joins Arnhem's Growing Bitcoin Economy,"Adding to the impressive roster of 40 merchants in the Dutch city of Arnhem that already accept bitcoin, a city centre supermarket has now also made the decision to accept payments in the digital currency.  With the move, the Spar Arnhem Centraal has become the first franchised supermarket in the Netherlands to accept bitcoin.  The owners say that they started processing cryptocurrency payments yesterday via a point-of-sale system provided by Dutch firm BitKassa.  Notably, the integration came about after encouragement from the organisers of the Arnhem Bitcoincity project, which kicked off in May with a scheme to encourage local merchants to make bitcoin payments available across the city.  ""The addition of Spar Arnhem Centraal to Arnhem Bitcoincity means a huge growth in the number of products and services that can be paid for with bitcoin in Arnhem,"" project organiser Patrick van der Meijde told Coindesk, adding:  ""The ultimate goal of the organisers behind the project, the ability to pay all of our everyday expenses in bitcoin, has now taken another big leap forward.""  Attracting new customers  Holder of the local Spar franchise Luke van Gelder is not a bitcoin user himself, but he was aware of the Arnhem Bitcoincity project. After speaking with the project organisers several times, Van Gelder decided to take the leap.  He said:  ""It seems like an interesting project, and fun to support. I don't personally expect to gain a huge amount of extra revenue by accepting bitcoin, but perhaps we'll attract a couple of new customers this way. Up till now we've processed 10 payments in bitcoin, which actually doesn't seem too bad for the first two days.""  Although not the first grocery store in the Netherlands to accept bitcoin – the Goudse Hoek supermarket in the Hague beat them to that title by a couple of months – Spar Arnhem Centraal is the first supermarket that's part of a well-known franchise to do so.  This does not, however, indicate a bitcoin-friendly policy by Netherlands-based multinational retail chain Spar, according to a company spokesperson.  ""The acceptance of bitcoin by Spar Arnhem Centraal is a local initiative by the Arnhem Bitcoincity team and this specific franchise holder,"" she said, explaining:  ""On a national level, Spar was not involved at all, although we do welcome individual experiments like these. If accepting bitcoin turns out to be a big success for Spar Arnhem Centraal, there is of course always a chance that the concept might be exported to different franchises, but this is not our intention at this point in time.""  Project growth  Arnhem Bitcoincity was launched exactly half a year ago. The project, which aims to establish Arnhem as the bitcoin capital of the world, started out with 15 bitcoin-accepting merchants in May, mostly consisting of bars and restaurants (see a gallery of the opening event here).  Six months later, the project has grown to around 40 participants, and added a more diverse mix of merchants that includes clothing stores, a bicycle shop, a hotel, a bakery, a florist and more.  To celebrate its success, the team behind Arnhem Bitcoincity is organising a special event this evening, Arnhem Bitcoin Metropolis, where Dutch bitcoiners can meet up over dinner and drinks – payable in bitcoin, of course.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC,Aaron van Wirdum,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/11/28/dutch-supermarket-joins-arnhems-growing-bitcoin-economy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0afccd0e2858d77c9ef3b54b7cfaac59c31c3d31-800x558.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377853,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73oF3,1417189890,Save the Children Now Accepting Bitcoin Donations,"Update (17:30 BST 28th November): Updated with comment from Ettore Rossetti, director of digital marketing and social media at Save the Children USA.      Global charity Save the Children has announced it is now accepting bitcoin donations through a partnership with payment processor BitPay.  The charity said it had started accepting bitcoin through its personalised BitPay donation page just in time for the winter holidays.  “We have already seen the generosity of the bitcoin community, and working with BitPay allows us to keep 100% of the donations, helping us serve even more children,” said Ettore Rossetti, director of digital marketing and social media at Save the Children.  Elizabeth Ploshay, head of non-profit outreach for BitPay said Save the Children showcases the advantages of bitcoin for charities – there are no fees and no minimum donations, and bitcoin-friendly charities can count on the support of the enthusiastic bitcoin community.  Credit and debit cards, on the other hand, bring higher fees and the risk of donations from fraudulent cards, which cost the charity in bank charges when the money is returned. As a result, small donations are hardly worth collecting.  Rossetti explained:  Nonprofits measure their fundraising efficiency on cost to raise a dollar but speed to raise a dollar is important too. In the past, donors would mail in checks in order to donate and some still do. We have to wait for the mail and then for the check to clear. Credit cards and e-commerce have accelerated the transaction process, which is helpful during rapid onset emergencies in particular. We think that bitcoin will minimize chargebacks and since BitPay waives fees, more of the net donation actually comes to us.  Emphasis on Africa  Last year, Save the Children distributed aid to more than 143 million children around the world, from the US to Africa. Much of the organisation's focus this year has been on West Africa, which is going through the deadliest Ebola epidemic in history.  Save the Children became involved in bitcoin-related campaigns late last year, when it took part in a campaign to raise bitcoin donations for Typhoon Haiyan Relief, hosted by the BitGive Foundation.  The success of the campaign and the relationship with the BitGive Foundation prompted Save the Children to embrace bitcoin donations. “Accepting bitcoin donations seemed like a natural next step for us,” said Rossetti.  The charity's first bitcoin campaigns are already listed on bitcoinblackfriday.com and bitcoingivingtuesday.org.  Bitcoin donations will benefit Save the Children's Relief Fund to help combat the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, which has claimed 6,000 lives so far.  ""We need need all the help we can get to stop Ebola. We hope that accepting bitcoin demonstrates our willingness to innovate and evolve in order to stay contemporary and to inspire new donors to donate to us who may never had done so before,"" Rossetti told CoinDesk.  Save the Children is already on the ground in the region, providing assistance and working with health ministries in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. The organisation is building Ebola health centres and caring for children orphaned by the outbreak, as well as training health workers and providing them with essential medical equipment.  ""Save the Children is one of the first large non-profit organisations to start accepting bitcoin donations,"" the organisation said in a statement.  A use case for bitcoin  As spelled out by Ploshay, bitcoin offers several advantages that make it an appealing payments choice for non-profit organisations and, although adoption has been limited, charities are now starting to see the plus side of digital currencies.  Two months ago, United Way became the biggest charity to accept bitcoin donations. Notably, United Way is one of the largest privately held non-profit organisations in the world, raising more than $5bn every year.  Earlier this month, Ghanaian remittances startup Beam launched a donations hub to raise funds for charities involved in fight against Ebola. The Sierra Leone Liberty Group, a group of bitcoin entrepreneurs, also joined the fight against the deadly virus in October.  A number of other charities have also embraced bitcoin in recent months, such as the American Red Cross, Greenpeace USA and the UK's Royal National Lifeboat Institution. Of course, it is worth mentioning Sean's Outpost, a Florida-based homeless outreach organisation, which has long relied on bitcoin.  Some of the biggest bitcoin companies, including payment processors BitPay and Coinbase, have also done their part by waiving fees for charities and making donations of their own.  Individuals like Roger Ver have also made notable donations to good causes, not to mention countless anonymous bitcoiners around the world who put their bitcoins to good use.

42377851,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73oHZ,1417183548,"Meet OneWallet, the New Auction Site for Bitcoiners","For those still mourning the demise of early bitcoin auction sites like Bitmit, there is a new place to bid for a special deal with your cryptocurrency: OneWallet.io.  Like Internet auction giant eBay, OneWallet has both bidding auctions and direct sales from anyone who wishes to join as a retailer, with 620 product listings in categories including electronics, fashion, health and beauty, and home and garden after only two weeks of public activity.  As the name implies, OneWallet also functions as a digital wallet for users to store their bitcoins, even if they're not spending them on the site. The system automatically generates new wallets for merchant or buyer accounts, though all customers are free to use their existing external ones.  The new site is working in partnership with CoinsForTech.com, an established online electronics retailer that accepts bitcoin, dogecoin and litecoin, and has already processed over $500,000 in orders to 56 countries. It should be noted, however, that OneWallet for the moment accepts only bitcoin.  Both companies have the same founder, Lee Marburg, and are registered in Australia. Sellers are based in several countries so far, but can be anywhere, and generally ship worldwide.  Encouraging bitcoin use  Speaking to CoinDesk, Marburg said he built the site with Bitcoin Brisbane founder Lucas Cullen in their spare time over the past six months. Testing was conducted privately with select customers over the two months before the public launch.  One aim, he said, was to build a beginner-friendly bitcoin wallet and an avenue for people to actually use the digital currency to buy goods and services.  Marburg added:  ""The second aim is to push bitcoin as an international trading tool. My experience with CoinsForTech has been hugely positive and I’ve got no doubts that bitcoin/digital currency has a huge role to play in the future of international B2B and B2C commerce. I am associated with some powerful suppliers and merchants who are not overly keen on accepting bitcoin.""  OneWallet could entice these reluctant merchants with ""a relatively hands-free option to get their feet wet"" with bitcoin, he said, while also creating buyer demand for purchasing with bitcoin through low fees and an easy-to-use platform.  The company charges merchants 2% of the final price for every successful listing.  Building in features  Buyers on OneWallet are also protected when purchasing from any merchant with the 'BusinessVerified' badge next to its name. The company investigates any claim pertaining to a purchase from a verified seller and refunds the USD value of the purchase if the claim is successful.  Future plans, Marburg said, included merchants being remunerated in their local currencies if they wished. He described this as ""a non-negotiable for bringing 'blue-chip' merchants on board"", and said OneWallet is already in negotiations with potential payment processors.  Additionally, within weeks, wallets will have two-of-three multisig and invoicing features, plus two factor authentication (2FA) logins via Google Authenticator or Authy. 2FA is already active for wallet withdrawals.  Global customer base  Since OneWallet has only been live for two weeks, Marburg said there has been only a handful of paying customers so far, but that those customers have come from all continents, except Africa and South America.  The majority of current merchants are based in Asia and the US, but mainly Hong Kong, Singapore and China. He said OneWallet had targeted Asia purposefully, as the region was able to service most of the world at a fraction of the cost of most Western countries, particularly with shipping.  Most products listed on the site are available for shipping internationally at reasonable rates, such as $5-10 for a smartphone and $20 for a DSLR camera.  All prices are marked in US dollars, though Marburg said another planned customer feature is the ability to set a preferred local currency. This would in turn enable sellers to list items in whatever currency they want, with the BTC equivalent displayed alongside.
