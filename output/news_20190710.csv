Blockstack will begin selling the SEC-approved tokens – essentially an investment vehicle for fundraising – on Thursday.  This appears to be one of the first SEC-approved token offerings on the market and will chart a way forward for U.S. small business funding in the future. Founders Muneeb Ali and Ryan Shea told WSJ reporter Paul Vigna that they spent $2 million to get approval for the sale.  “Mr. Ali said it took so long and cost so much because the company and the SEC had to start from scratch to create a protocol for a digital-token offering under Reg A+,” he wrote.  The Reg A+ platform lets companies raise up to $50 million from retail investors as opposed to only from so-called accredited investors. Thus far the Reg A+ uptake has been limited even considering the reduced documentation required by the SEC.  Connecting a token with a Reg A+ funding round could turn these into truly cryptocurrency-based equity investment vehicles, although Blockstack is selling utility tokens this time around.  Blockstack has already raised $5 million from venture capitalists and another $47 million in a 2017 token sale.

42403042,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdeTxj,1562792476,US Election Authority Set to Approve Congressional Candidate's Plan to Issue Ethereum Token,"A candidate for Congress in Florida wants to give ethereum-based tokens to campaign volunteers in an experimental effort to incentivize their work — and federal officials appear poised to give their approval.  In late May, the campaign for Omar Reyes, who is running for office in Florida’s 22nd Congressional District as an independent candidate, sent a letter to the Federal Election Commission (FEC) seeking permission for the “distribution to potential volunteers and any voters interested in participating in our cryptocurrency experiment.”  The idea is this: the “Omar2020” token is based on the ERC-20 standard, which allows for the creation of tokens on the ethereum network. According to the Reyes campaign’s letter, the kinds of activities they’d want to reward include registering to volunteer, signing up for a mailing list, or hosting official campaign events.  Further, the campaign’s letter stresses that the tokens “have no monetary value,” and that the tokens would essentially serve as a digital scoreboard for volunteers. As the campaign draws to a close, “our committee would like to reward our volunteers with the highest amount of (OMR) tokens with the choice of one of three gifts of our appreciation, paid for by the Omar2020 committee.”  A draft advisory opinion  published July 5 and attributed to FEC chair Ellen Weintraub indicates that officials will give their blessing to the experiment, noting that the tokens themselves are “analogous to more traditional types of campaign souvenirs, such as bumper stickers, yard signs or buttons” and wouldn’t run afoul of federal statutes.  As the draft opinion notes:  “The Commission concludes that the Committee may distribute OMR Tokens to volunteers and supporters as an incentive to engage in volunteer activities as described in the request because OMR Tokens do not constitute compensation; rather, OMR Tokens are materially indistinguishable from traditional forms of campaign souvenirs and nothing in the Act or Commission regulations prohibits a campaign committee from distributing free campaign souvenirs to volunteers or supporters.”  In the opinion, Weintraub stated it expects the Reyes campaign to report any transaction fees accrued from the token transfers will be reported as expenditures per regulations.  The draft opinion’s public comment period ended at noontime EST on Wednesday, according to the FEC document. Now, the draft opinion will be considered by commission members at a forthcoming meeting. The next meeting is scheduled for July 25, but its agenda has yet to be published.  A representative for the Reyes campaign did not respond to a request for comment by press time.  The FEC and cryptocurrency  This month’s request isn’t the first time that FEC officials have considered opinion requests that center in some way around cryptocurrencies.  For example, the FEC recently considered whether a campaign could accept contributions in the form of cryptocurrency mining rewards. The FEC gave its final approval this past April with a caveats that such activities don't amount to a form of volunteering as originally proposed.  The most impactful decision to date was the 2014 opinion that opened the door to cryptocurrency donations to campaigns. At the time, the FEC said that it would consider a bitcoin contribution as an in-kind donation.  That move set the stage for a number of political campaigns in the U.S. to solicit crypto-donations, including Kentucky Senator Rand Paul’s 2016 presidential bid.  Most recently, U.S. Representative Eric Swalwell announced that his now-defunct presidential effort would accept crypto contributions.  Andrew Yang, another 2020 presidential hopeful, is also accepting crypto contributions. His campaign published a policy statement on blockchain and digital assets this spring, and during a May appearance at CoinDesk’s Consensus 2019 conference in New York, Yang pledged to provide greater regulatory clarity for the industry.

42403048,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdeU4c,1562780853,Turkey's New Economic Roadmap Calls for Central Bank Cryptocurrency,"An economic road map unveiled by the government of Turkey this week includes several items related to blockchain, including a bid to create a central bank digital currency based on the technology.  The Eleventh Development Plan, published on the government's official website, was submitted to the Turkish Parliament on July 8, according to regional reports. It covers the period between 2019 and 2023, and is broadly intended to serve as a guiding point for improving Turkey's economy.  The wide-ranging plan covers an array of subjects, but notably states that a ""blockchain-based digital central bank money will be implemented,"" according to a translation.  The document also indicates that legal and technology infrastructure will be fostered by the government in an effort to utilize blockchain for ""transport and customs"" purposes. Additionally, blockchain is mentioned as one of a number of new approaches, including artificial intelligence and connected devices -- also known as the Internet of Things -- that will be used to enhance public services. In this latter case, it's not clear at this time how blockchain will be utilized.  Few details of the proposed cryptocurrency are known, but the country has been entertaining the idea of a national digital asset, Turkcoin, since at least early 2018. According to reports at the time, the idea was pitched by lawmaker Ahmet Kenan Tanrikulu, the deputy chair of Turkey’s Nationalist Movement Party and the country’s former Industry Minister.  The news that the central bank of Turkey will develop a blockchain-based currency comes days after Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, fired its governor, Murat Cetinkaya. According to the Financial Times, Erdogan said this week that the central bank will provide a greater degree of support to the economy.  Other elements of the Eleventh Development Plan, while not directly related to cryptocurrency and blockchain, could ultimately impact businesses working in those areas.  For example, the government plans to introduce a Regulatory Experiment Area, an Association of Payment Services and Electronic Money Institutions, and the Istanbul Finance and Technology Base. Turkish banks have long partnered with crypto exchanges, though these institutions often impose strict listing and on-boarding policies.

According to Reuters  , Powell added that Libra raised ""many serious concerns"" around financial stability and consumer protection as well. The Federal Reserve has apparently created a working group to track the development of the cryptocurrency, and is working with central banks in other nations as well.  The U.S. Financial Stability Oversight Council, a federal organization created in 2010 that operates under the auspices of the U.S. Treasury Department, will also look into the project.  Powell explained that some of the concerns around Libra stem from Facebook's size, noting that it ""has a couple billion-plus users.""

These documents were presented as evidence for the NYAG's argument that it has the legal authority to investigate the companies because they had New York customers.  However, Metropolitan's relationships with Tether; Bitfinex's parent company iFinex; and Digfinex (the majority owner of Tether and iFinex) appear to have been brief.  A spokesperson for the bank told CoinDesk Wednesday that there was only minimal activity with the three accounts, saying in an email:  ""Metropolitan Commercial Bank had limited, corporate operating accounts with Tether Holdings LTD, iFinex Inc, and Digfinex Inc, all with negligible activity, and requested the accounts to be closed after less than 5 months of the accounts being opened.""  The spokesperson clarified that the bank itself requested that the accounts be closed, not Tether, iFinex or Digfinex.  A spokesperson for Signature Bank would not discuss the matter, telling CoinDesk that ""we do not comment on client-related matters.""  A spokesperson for the exchange did not immediately return a request for comment.  The NYAG is investigating Bitfinex's alleged cover-up of an $850 million loss by borrowing potentially up to $900 million from Tether's reserves. The reserve is theoretically in place to back the USDT stablecoin, which Tether previously claimed was backed 1 to 1 by U.S. dollars.  Bitfinex, Tether and their affiliates have until July 22 to file a response to the NYAG's latest motion. The case itself will be back in court a week later, with a hearing scheduled for July 29.

Hedge Fund Metastable Capital and venture firm Accomplice led the oversubscribed round.  Near  is developing, but hasn’t yet launched, the NEAR Protocol, a “sharded,” proof-of-stake blockchain. The protocol differentiates itself from competitors like EOS or Tron by running parallel computations on sharded sections of the network to boost throughput.  Additionally, “parallelism” could allow the network to linearly scale as more nodes join, eliminating network capacity limits. Meta transactions, contract-based accounts and gas fee rebates are also available at the protocol level.  “We believe that Near’s developer-friendly proof-of-stake protocol will usher in a new wave of decentralized applications and give power back to end users,” said Ash Egan, who directs crypto investments at Accomplice.  Near intends to use the funds to recruit more developers and build-out a mainnet of its platform, which is currently operating in beta. The beta protocol currently has fewer than 10 users, though, ""we are in contact overall with 75 projects at the moment,"" said CEO Alex Skidanov.  Long term, Near's aspirations run much deeper. Said Skidanov:  “Assembling a world-class development team and creating the technology is really just the first step – the next is launching a global movement that puts blockchain technology in the hands of the developers and entrepreneurs who will carry it to consumers everywhere via the apps and businesses they create.""  To get there, Near will focus on a fair token distribution, adoption by both validators and companies, and capturing a significant portion of the existing blockchain market.  Other round participants include Electric Capital, Pantera Capital and Amplify Partners, as well as contributions from Coinbase Ventures and Ripple’s Xpring, among others.  Said Pantera partner Paul Veradittakit:  ""The Near team is focused on building developer tools and creating an ecosystem that is inclusive of developers, designers, and business development backgrounds, which differentiates them from most other projects in the space.""

42403040,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdeTvl,1562771747,Winklevoss Twins’ Gemini Exchange May Join Facebook’s Libra Project,"Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, co-founders of the New York-based crypto exchange Gemini, may soon join the Libra Association, the consortium governing Facebook’s proposed cryptocurrency.  “We’re definitely looking at it in earnest and we’re excited about the project,” Cameron told CoinDesk Tuesday.  Tyler added that in their view, Libra is a harbinger of cryptos to come:  “Our feeling is, this is the first of many FANG [Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google] companies to have a token project. Our prediction is in the next 24 months almost every FANG company will have a coin or be working on some sort of project.”  Joining Libra might be a surprise move to some, considering the Winklevoss brothers’ legendary fight over control of Facebook with its CEO Mark Zuckerberg, their former Harvard classmate. But they now want to be “frenemies”with a mutual goal of promoting mainstream crypto adoption.  Plus, the twins are aiming to diversify Gemini’s token offerings by 2020. They recently applied for a broker-dealer license through the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, which would allow Gemini to list digital securities.  The Libra white paper, unveiled last month, envisions “a competitive network of exchanges buying and selling Libra,” enabling holders to easily convert the coin, backed by a basket of stable government currencies, into local fiat.  So far, only one crypto exchange, Coinbase, has joined the Libra Association, whose ranks also include traditional financial players such as PayPal, Visa and Mastercard and VC firms such as Union Square Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz. (Crypto custodian Xapo is also a member.)  Playing nice  The Winklevoss are also personally invested in both Filecoin and Tezos. So those might offer examples of the types of “utility tokens” they’d like to eventually offer on the exchange with regulatory approval, Tyler said.  “We ask [regulators] for permission, not forgiveness,” Cameron added.  Although U.S. lawmakers have so far given Facebook’s global cryptocurrency project an icy reception, even urging the association to halt development, Libra’s vision of a global currency otherwise aligns with the twins’ goals for their own exchange. Cameron said they want to expand internationally, starting with Europe and Asia.  “Our marketplace will be virtual commodities, virtual securities, and on and on,” Tyler said. “Pretty much anything that can come onto a blockchain.”  From his perspective, “mainstream adoption” means higher cryptocurrency prices.  “If bitcoin really is Gold 2.0, it has to have a market cap of $7 trillion,” he said. “I think that market cap is a good measure of adoption and how many people are actually in crypto.”  Winklevoss image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TOKEN SALE,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/07/10/winklevoss-twins-gemini-exchange-may-join-facebooks-libra-project,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fce4488b55668b43e97caec24375475b3cf9fead-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403054,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdeU8Y,1562769631,"Fold App Enables Bitcoin Lightning Payments at Whole Foods, Starbucks","Fold, a payments platform, is introducing a lightning network protocol that will allegedly enable users to shop in-store or online at several retailers, including Starbucks, Whole Foods, AMC, Home Depot, and Southwest Airlines.  Though customers will transact in bitcoin, the payments will be settled in whatever currency the merchant chooses. This eliminates the risk of cryptocurrency volatility for merchants, while expanding pool of potential clients who would prefer to transact in bitcoin.  The protocol integrates with existing payments systems in a merchant’s POS, dealing “directly with prepaid access programs like gift cards, store credit, rails or other options merchants are used to accepting,” said Will Reeves, CEO of Fold.  To be clear there is no direct connection between Fold and any of these big merchants. Transactions show up in fiat on a company’s balance sheet as either gift card purchases or store credit, depending on how Fold integrates with a particular POS. This integration requires “no effort on the merchant’s side,” and does not require the installation of new hardware or software.  Fold began working on this P2P feature last year, according to Reeves, who saw lightning network transactions as a way to onboard consumers to use cryptocurrency not just as a store of value, but a payment route.  “Customers navigate to the Fold app, where they are presented with a list of available merchants. They then select the denomination and how much they want to spend,” said Reeves. Fold is non-custodial and allows clients to operate any wallet of their choosing. Once an invoice is populated, it “immediately displays a barcode or other payment method"" generated via the merchant's own gift card API.  The process allegedly takes 30 seconds.  ""We believe that Bitcoin provides a fundamentally better way to pay, one that preserves privacy, resists censorship and is natively global. To this end, we build products that make spending bitcoin a no-brainer, making it as easy to use, rewarding and widely accepted as a credit card,"" Reeves wrote in a company statement.  Fold will not charge fees for the service, but expects to receive a margin of the transaction from merchants for bringing in new customers. The company “generates revenue,” ands is “not venture reliant,” Reeves said.  The startup is currently being incubated by thesis.co, a venture production studio, and has “thousands of users, with tens of thousands in transaction volume across the globe,"" said Reeves. Though he said the majority of users are based in the United States.  The firm previously unveiled ""Lightning Pizza,"" a service to order Domino's pizza through the lightning network in February.

42403041,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdeTyi,1562767221,Binance Labs–Backed Startup Boosting Blockchain Speeds Raises $3 Million,"Marlin Protocol has reeled in a $3 million seed round from Binance Labs, Arrington XRP, Electric Capital, NGC and other investors.  The startup, based in San Francisco and Bangalore, India, works to increase network speeds across a variety of blockchains. Throughput constraints – or limitations on how much data can smoothly flow through a network – are seen as a major impediment to widespread blockchain adoption.  Marlin Protocol  aims to improve speeds across multiple chains by using what CEO Siddhartha Dutta calls a “bandwidth-sharing marketplace.”  Dutta explained that significant improvements to bandwidth on a blockchain can be made by introducing a subset of new network actors called “relayers.”  “Marlin is a leader in a new class of infrastructure startups in crypto that are blockchain-agnostic and will dramatically increase network performance,” Arrington XRP Capital partner Michael Arrington told CoinDesk. “We are happy to support them.”  Certain blockchains, such as Algorand, already employ relayers, said Dutta. However, the number and comparative cost to attack these relayers are both low.  “The number of relayers in Algorand is in single digits,” Dutta said. “If anyone is able to bribe just those single-digit relayers, you have brought down the network because they’re the ones responsible for all this communication. Now, if every blockchain tries to do this, every blockchain introduces these single points of failure.""  As such, Marlin Protocol aims to introduce a large network of relayers able to secure virtually any blockchain. This would occur alongside more common node activities such as staking and mining.  “Most of the ethereum miners, bitcoin miners or even those professional staking companies, they already have good bandwidth connections,” said Dutta. “All those nodes would be interested in merging mining along with Marlin so that they can also get paid for that bandwidth their spending anyways.”  So far, Marlin says it has partnered with a number of different projects to run its services on private test networks. Partners include WandX, Murmur, Blockcloud, Matic and Holochain.  In two to three months, however, Dutta envisions the launch of a public Marlin testnet. Beyond that, Dutta also mentioned a targeted mainnet launch for sometime in 2020.  ""Supercharging network performance solves a major problem across proof-of-work and proof-of-stake blockchains today,"" Electric Capital Managing Partner Curtis Spencer told CoinDesk. ""And their long-term vision around privacy-preserving packet delivery and decentralization is particularly exciting to us.""

""In addition, DApp does not need to make separate types of transaction that follows coin types by themselves anymore,"" wrote Samsung. ""The SDK offers a payment gateway for cryptocurrency remittance with its UI. To use this payment solution, DApp needs a keystore. With this, Samsung Blockchain SDK links users not only to the Samsung KeyStore but also to any external cold wallets as well.""  Access to the SDK is currently limited - users aren't able to download the SDK directly but must request access - and it's not clear when users will be able to experiment with the code let alone use it in production. Samsung also announced its own KeyStore, a device-based private key storage system within Samsung's security layer, called Knox.  ""To ensure complete security, the private key and information located in the Samsung Blockchain Keystore are never saved to a Samsung or external cloud, nor is it seen by the devices’ Android OS,"" they wrote.  Image via Samsung  As you see above, there is no clear way to access the files, even with a Samsung Developer account, and the Samsung developer blog hasn't mentioned the SDK. We've reached out for further comment.  ""Official version of Samsung Blockchain SDK will be announced by the end of 2019. In the meantime, developers can request a partnership to use the beta version of the Samsung Blockchain SDK,"" wrote the developers in a FAQ.  The company announced a number of blockchain-based initiatives over the past year including the launch of a crypto wallet in March and hints of a Dapp platform.

42403053,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdeUBV,1562765443,Commercial Debt Market Goes Live With Backing From Coinbase Ventures,"Cadence, an ethereum-powered marketplace for commercial debt, is out of its test phase.  The startup, which recently secured a place on the Bloomberg terminal for its pools of commercial loans, is now open to all institutional and accredited investors. Such users can now contribute funds to packages of short-term loans that help businesses cover payroll, inventory and other unexpected costs.  ""Cadence is doing its part to help power the growth of small to medium-sized enterprises by providing them market-driven cost efficiencies,” Cadence founder and CEO Nelson Chu said in a statement. The loan packages are made transparent by the ethereum blockchain.  In private beta with select investors, Cadence saw $5.67 million pass through its offerings since January.  With the news, Cadence is also announcing the closure of a pre-seed round of venture funding. Led by Recharge Capital, a fintech-focused family office, the $2 million round also included Argo Ventures, the venture arm of Argo Group, a New York Stock Exchange-listed specialty insurance company; Coinbase Ventures, the investment arm of the unicorn cryptocurrency exchange; and InBlockchain, a leading crypto investor based in Asia.  The round also included individual investors, many of whom serve as executives at banks that might buy debt on Cadence. With more investors than he had room for on his cap table, Chu explained how he picked partners:  ""The value is really in how much they can help us drive institutional adoption.""  The market for private credit is growing rapidly. According to a report by BNY Mellon, it first hit $1 billionhttps://www.bnymellon.com/_global-assets/pdf/our-thinking/private-debt-the-rise-of-an-asset-class.pdf in 2017, and it has since grown to a market in the hundreds of billions of dollars. In a widely cited forecast, the Alternative Credit Council estimates it should reach $1 trillion by 2020.  How it works  Cadence offers short-term loans paid to businesses to cover operational needs, targeting a 10 percent annual return. So a three-month loan term could return over 2 percent at maturity.  For a hedge fund, this can be a nice, reliable place to stick some excess capital without holding it up for too long, in case something really amazing pops up.  ""We are by far the best 'try before you buy' model,"" Chu said. ""We've had hedge fund managers put in $500 to see if it works, and then it comes back with interest and they put in $25,000.""  Once an investor has their identity checks run and is granted access to the system, they'll see an array of loans on offer and how much space is left in each round. All these offerings are also viewable inside the Bloomberg Terminal as well, for traders who live inside that system.  All the attributes of each pool – such as sector, risk profile, the originator and other details – are viewable on each loan. All the loans include multiple borrowers, to help spread out risk.  One advantage of getting into a pool is that previous investors get first dibs if it rolls over. If an instrument cycles over again, existing investors get a few days to renew their allocation before it opens up to new investors.  ""If you go on any other private crowdfunding platform, the biggest complaint is you get locked out,"" Chu said. ""That first look, investors really appreciate.""

42403043,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdeTzh,1562763607,Sia Network Raises $3.5 Million From Bain Capital to Become Crypto Hulu,"Blockchain startups may be slowly recovering from the 2018 slump.  Boston-based Nebulous, makers of the Sia network for decentralized data storage, recently closed a $3.5 million pre–Series A round led by Bain Capital Ventures, along with participants like Bessemer Venture Partners and Dragonfly Capital Partners.  Salil Deshpande of Bain Capital told CoinDesk that distributed, permissionless storage options are the cornerstone of decentralized apps (dapps) and that Nebulous is the only investable startup with a live solution that lacks glaring technical issues.  “If [dapps] use centralized storage, then they are not decentralized any more,” Deshpande said. “In the future, centralized apps will also be able to use decentralized storage.”  Nebulous CEO David Vorick told CoinDesk the company has now raised a total of $6.3 million since launching in 2014.  ""Today we have about 450 terabytes of data that users are actively storing on the network,"" Vorick said. “Our metrics suggest that's between 500 and 1,000 people to date.""  According to the third party site SiaStats.info, this includes roughly 332 node operators, many of which are IT professionals running nodes from data centers.  Stepping back, Sia’s token model has set it apart since Siacoin launched in 2015. The network’s native Siacoin must be earned through mining. It wasn’t distributed as part of an initial coin offering. As such, Vorick said the Nebulous-owned hardware maker Obelisk sold $15 million worth of Sia miners, roughly 6,000 machines, before it ceased sales this month.  Both host node operators and storage space “renters” lock a little Siacoin in a smart contract escrow, including the transaction fee, to ensure the operator gets paid for keeping data safe. If the host loses the encrypted data, he or she forfeits those tokens. Meanwhile, a small fraction of that transaction fees is automatically allocated to 10,000 Siafunds.  These wallets are the startup’s sole monetization strategy for the network, charging roughly $1 per Terabyte monthly. Plus, Nebulous sells fractional ownership of some Siafund tokens to investors as an additional capital source beyond equity.  ""In the Sia protocol itself, in the blockchain code, there is a requirement that every time you make a file contract, 3.9 percent of the coins in that contract are distributed to the Siafund holders,” Vorick explained.  This fresh round will give the company fodder to double its team size from 12 to 24 by this time next year, he added. In part, these employees will help Nebulous focus on services related to media streaming and storage this summer.  Crypto Hulu  People who have archival footage or indie films, plus a wide range of materials too niche for Hulu or Netflix, could store and stream the footage with Sia from anywhere in the world.  “You don't have to be a host [node] in order to put data onto the Sia network,” Vorick said. “It will be a comparable experience to using something like Hulu.""  Plus, users could offer it to others through third-party Sia apps. One such independent app, Filebase, offers a portal for paid clients that want to use Sia without downloading software or buying cryptocurrency. When it comes to incumbent rivals like MaidSafe, the Filebase team said they chose the Sia network because it has fewer disruptions and less restructuring.  “We’ll allow you to generate a public URL or link that you can share and it will allow you to stream or share a picture, any number of those things,” the Filebase team said, adding they have ""several hundred"" users so far. “Our goal is to grow Filebase into a subscription service.”  Indeed, Bain Capital’s Deshpande referred to such streaming as one of the leading use cases for decentralized storage systems.  “The idea is you hit ‘play’ and it starts streaming within a third of a second,” Deshpande said, speaking of Sia network updates on the horizon. “The question is always: Is the token necessary? I believe in this case that a token is actually necessary.”  While competitors like Filecoin slowly develop similar storage models, and newcomers like the startup Fluree enter the game, Nebulous is betting on its first-mover advantage.  Speaking to one perk the Sia model has over traditional data storage options, Nebulous CEO Vorick added:  ""It’s possible to have nothing more than your wallet seed and use that to recover all of your data. That’s really powerful. Now with just private keys users can have global access to both data and money.”  Members of the Nebulous team – including CEO David Vorick (second from right) – at the Bitcoin 2019 conference in San Francisco.

42403051,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdeU7Z,1562760009,"Visa, Blockchain Capital, a16z Back $40 Million Series B Round for Crypto Custodian Anchorage","Anchorage, a company providing crypto custody services for institutional investors, has just raised $40 million in a Series B funding round.  In an announcement Wednesday, the firm said the round was led by Blockchain Capital, with Visa Inc. and existing investors such as Andreessen Horowitz also participating. Anchorage has now raised $57 million in total funding since 2017.  Diogo Monica, Anchorage co-founder and president, said:  “Our mission at Anchorage is to advance institutional participation in the digital asset class, and this funding will improve our ability to do precisely that. To have the support of pioneering organizations like Visa and Blockchain Capital is a validation of Anchorage’s vision for the emerging economy of digital assets.”  The new investment will be used to build out its service, with Anchorage planning to offer support for ""all digital assets,"" as well as to integrate its offerings with other financial services firms and boost auditing and compliance.  ""This investment is consistent with Visa’s global strategy to partner with and invest in emerging fintech companies,” said Terry Angelos, SVP and global head of fintech at Visa. “We’re pleased to add Anchorage to our growing investment portfolio.”  Anchorage has been designed and built for the next generation of crypto assets. Its custody solution, something of a darling among Silicon Valley types, had been included in the Libra Association – an entity founded by Facebook to manage and develop its recently unveiled cryptocurrency project.  Old-style cold storage will not meet the requirements of institutions dealing in crypto the future, according to Monica.

42403062,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdeUDT,1562756432,Bitcoin Price Recovers 85% of Recent Losses With Move Above $13K,"View  BTC continues to chart bullish higher lows and higher highs on short duration charts, favoring a retest of the recent high of $13,880.  A move to $13,880 may take time if prices drop below key support at $12,538. That would allow a deeper pullback to $12,000.  A high-volume UTC close below $12,000 would invalidate the short-term bullish setup, although that looks unlikely.  Bitcoin (BTC) bolstered its already bullish technical setup with a move above $13,000 earlier today.  The top cryptocurrency by market capitalization rose to $13,154 in the Asian trading hours, the highest level since June 27, according to Bitstamp data.  With the move to two-week highs, BTC has recovered 85 percent of the sell-off from $13,880 to $9,614 seen in seven days to July 2.  Further, with the uptick in prices, bitcoin’s dominance rate – the leading cryptocurrency’s share of the total market – has jumped to a fresh 27-month high of 65 percent, according to data source CoinMarketCap.  As a result, the rally looks sustainable and the cryptocurrency appears on track to challenge the year-to-date high of $13,880 hit on June 26.  As of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading at $13,000 on Bitstamp, representing 4 percent gains on the day.  Hourly and 15-minute charts  Bitcoin rallied 2.4 percent to $12,873 in 60 minutes earlier today, confirming an upside break of the symmetrical triangle – a bullish continuation pattern – on the hourly chart (above left).  With a move above the resistance at $12,883 (horizontal line), BTC also established a fresh higher high.  Therefore, the path of least resistance is on the higher side – more so, as prices reinforced the bullish breakout with a successful defense of the former hurdle-turned-support of $12,883 at 07:15 UTC.  The 15-minute chart is reporting a bull flag breakout, a continuation pattern which often accelerates the preceding uptrend. The breakout has created room for a rally to $13,868 (target calculated by adding the pole height of $878 to the breakout price of $12,990).  The rise to the recent high of $13,880, however, may not happen in the U.S. trading hours if the cryptocurrency weakens the immediate bullish case with a move below $12,538.  Daily and weekly charts  Bitcoin closed above well above $12,061 yesterday (above left), invalidating the bearish lower high created on June 28. The 5- and 10-day moving averages (MAs) are again trending north, indicating a bullish setup.  The 14-day relative strength index (RSI) is reporting bullish conditions with an above 50 print, and the Chaikin money flow indicator is holding well into the positive territory, indicating sustained buying pressure.  All-in-all, BTC appears on track to test and possibly break above the June 26 high of $13,880.  It is worth noting that the 14-week relative strength index (above right) is currently hovering at the highest level since December 2017, meaning BTC is most overbought in 19 months.  That, however, should not be a cause for concern for the bulls. After all, BTC’s quick recovery from sub-$10,000 levels has invalidated the bearish exhaustion indicated on the charts in the last week of June.  As the old saying goes, an overbought market can remain overbought longer than sellers can stay solvent. Indicators tend to stay overbought for a prolonged period in a strongly trending market.

In a report Wednesday, the news provider cited sources ""familiar with the matter"" as saying that Diginex Ltd., a company providing blockchain solutions and consultancy services, is soon to announce a merger with 8i Enterprises Acquisition Corp.  With 8i already a Nasdaq-listed firm, the deal would allow Diginex to go public via a backdoor listing and avoid the regulatory complexities of a formal IPO process. The deal would reportedly still require approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  The Bloomberg sources said that, if completed, the deal would see Hong Kong-based Diginex valued at around $276 million including debt. Diginex shareholders would receive 20 million ordinary shares in 8i, valued at $10 each.  Both firms declined to comment on the merger, Bloomberg said.  Last month, Diginex teamed up with FIS, a financial services technology firm, to launch a trading tool aimed to help investors manage digital asset portfolios, the firm says on its website.  The reverse IPO, or reverse merger, method of going public has been attempted by other crypto firms.

42403056,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdeUAW,1562749215,Coinbase Is in Talks to Launch Its Own Insurance Company,"The takeaway:  Coinbase is exploring plans to set up its own “captive” insurance company, industry sources said.  At the start of this year, insurance broker Aon began establishing captive companies in the Cayman Islands, working with a handful of cryptocurrency firms.  Aon says a captive structure can help firms get access to additional coverage at more reasonable prices.  Insurance for crypto remains scarce, and major exchanges Kraken and Huobi say they simply self-insure by setting aside coins to cover losses from thefts or hacks.      Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase is in talks to set up its own regulated insurance company with the help of insurance broker giant Aon, industry sources told CoinDesk.  Establishing “captive” insurance subsidiaries, wholly owned by the firm being insured, is a time-honored way for corporations to reduce costs and improve access to reinsurance markets (a form of insurance purchased by insurance companies in order to mitigate risk). Nearly all Fortune 500 companies and thousands of midsize firms maintain captives, according to a December 2018 article in trade publication CPA Journal.  Coinbase and Aon see this structure as potentially part of the answer to the shortage of insurance available to crypto exchanges, the sources said. While Coinbase has obtained more coverage than most, often exchanges just self-insure by setting aside a bunch of coins to cover losses in the event of a hack or disappearance of customer funds. The problem with that approach is its lack of a formal structure, creating the temptation to access the funds for other purposes and ambiguity about how much coverage a firm actually has.  With a captive, on the other hand, the funds are segregated and held in a regulated, audited vehicle, which can help the firm go out and attain more cover from the reinsurance market. To be clear: the captive would insure only its parent company, not competitors.  Neither Aon nor Coinbase would comment on the latter’s interest in captive insurance. However, Aon did say that it established the industry's first crypto captive earlier this year for an unnamed client. This Caymans Islands-based captive will write “crime” policies covering hacks of hot (online) wallets and “specie” coverage for cryptocurrency kept offline in cold storage, the broker said.  The two companies have worked together before: in April, Aon helped arrange about $255 million in coverage for Coinbase’s hot wallets. The exchange, which keeps only 2% of client funds in hot wallets, held $25 billion of crypto at the height of the 2017 bullrun.  Aon said a handful of its crypto clients are considering the captive option, adding that Bermuda and some leading U.S. on-shore domiciles are expected to follow the Caymans soon.  “There is a lack of capacity and some are uncomfortable with what is available in the marketplace and are looking to alternative solutions,” said Jacqueline Quintal, a managing director and the financial institutions practice leader at Aon. “I think the path for most will be to buy some amount of traditional insurance first and then to explore alternative structures, potentially including a captive -- and we are having more and more of these conversations.”  The case for captives  Stepping back, a captive is an insurance company created and completely owned by another company to provide coverage for itself. It’s a regulated alternative to self-insurance which can offer direct access to reinsurance markets and act as an investment vehicle.  If pricing is too high in the commercial insurance markets or no underwriters are willing to cover a firm’s risk, captives are used to formalize self-insurance with reporting on capital and reserve requirements.  Speaking to the advantages of using a captive rather than simple self-insurance, Quintal said: “If a firm is self-insuring, they’ve accepted responsibility for funding 100% of any loss. Captives, in comparison, provide a means through which firms can access insurance or reinsurance, while also pre-funding self-insured loss amounts in a more formal way than simply setting aside capital.”  Taking this more formal and regulated approach, Quintal added, can help create more capacity in the market, and “by having more control over a firm’s insurance program, captives can bring the price of risk financing down over time.”  Even for a crypto firm, a captive would have to keep most of its claims reserve in fiat, but crypto could potentially be used for the surplus (additional funds reserved in case of an unexpected amount of claims), according to Ward Ching, managing director, Aon Captive Insurance Managers.  There have also been discussions about including crypto in the Caymans captive’s investment activities, said Ching.  “It’s all about doing the math and showing the domicile regulatory leadership how the inclusion of cryptocurrency as an asset class both satisfies the regulatory mandate and provides financial flexibility in a constructive and safe manner,” he said.  Self-insurance  It’s no secret that many of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges simply self-insure against hacks and losses.  The problem historically has been that crypto insurance is prohibitively expensive, way too limited and fiendishly tricky when it comes to actually making a claim. In response, crypto firms have resigned themselves to holding their own coins in cold storage (where the private keys are disconnected from the internet, in a hardware device or piece of paper locked in a safe) to deal with losses.  San Francisco-based exchange Kraken has been candid about having its own insurance fund. As Kraken CEO Jesse Powell told CoinDesk:  “The balance sheet is basically also called the insurance fund.”  Kraken has “well over $100 million” put aside, said Powell, much of it in bitcoin to save the company from having to go out and buy coins on the open market in the event clients’ coins need to be replaced.  Similarly, in February 2018, Singapore-based Huobi put aside 20,000 bitcoin as its fallback protection mechanism in the event of a security breach, known as “the Huobi security reserve”. As a further measure, it has hoarded a “protection fund” by earmarking 20 percent of transaction fees per quarter to buy back its native tokens.  “If you add our protection fund up with our reserve fund we are talking well over $400m of protection there,” Josh Goodbody, head of Europe and the Americas, Huobi global sales and institutional business told CoinDesk.  Powell, an outspoken critic of the state of insurance provision offered to crypto firms, said over the years his firm has been quoted insurance many times at prices which were “ridiculous and obscene.”  “There's just not a good deal out there,” he said, “I'm sure you can get someone to write you a deal for like 10% a year of the balance and actually have real meaningful coverage. But I don't think people are going to pay that.”  Goodbody, likewise, explained that Huobi had been around the block looking at insurance. Indeed, he questioned how coverage in the hundreds of millions of dollars touted by some firms would apply to hot wallets, which he said would be “extremely confusing and full of caveats and fine print.”  Considering alternatives  Exchanges tend to be loose in how they go about self-insuring, according to Powell.  “I think everybody basically has these funds on their balance sheet and they are investing them or dipping into them for operations,” he explained. “Nobody, as far as I know, has provided some sort of audit or an explicit statement about how these funds are segregated and kept in a different entity as if it were really like third party insurance provider.”  Nevertheless, Powell said he struggled to see what value it would add setting up a separate captive insurance company.  “I just feel like it's moving money between pockets of the same entity, and I don't really see how this actually helps the consumer have more protection. It's all the same basket of money anyway,” said Powell. “I don't know why this would be able to get a better deal than we could get directly with an insurance broker.”  Huobi’s Goodbody was more optimistic, calling Aon’s plans “extremely interesting and super positive for the market.”  Some innovators in the insurance space, such as ethereum-based Nexus Mutual and also Etherisc (another partner of Aon), have suggested going further than setting up individual captive vehicles and rather pooling together groups of crypto disaster funds into a system of reinsurance.  Powell agreed this idea seemed to have more potential value for the industry, but he questioned the practicalities.  “You could conceivably do a group insurance deal among the exchanges, like a co-operative kind of thing. But then you have to have your competitors audit everything and I think everybody's too smart for that – and too paranoid,” he said.  Aon's Ching agreed there was some “obvious logic” in getting a group of crypto self-insurers together and aggregating. The problem, he said, is these companies are very different once you get under the covers:  “They have different risk tolerances, different capital structures and different security mechanisms. Until they harmonize that it'll be hard to put a group captive together; not saying it's impossible, just a bumpier ride.”  Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong at Consensus 2019 image via CoinDesk archives",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/07/10/coinbase-is-in-talks-to-launch-its-own-insurance-company,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9ed9fa66afa57160ddcc92517560a9363256837b-2452x1464.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403047,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdeU3d,1562745641,Facebook Says It Won't Launch Crypto in India Due to Regulatory Issues,"Facebook has said that current regulatory restrictions mean it won't be launching its digital wallet service and cryptocurrency in India.  Speaking to local daily news source The Economic Times, a Facebook spokesperson said:  “There are no plans to offer Calibra in India. As you may know, there are local restrictions within India that made a launch of Calibra not possible at this time.”  The representative is likely referring to an order by the central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which last April effectively banned banks from providing services to cryptocurrency-related firms such as exchanges. Several of India's top exchanges have since closed, citing the RBI restriction as the reason for failing business.  The RBI order is being challenged in the supreme court, but the case seems to be in limbo pending some direction from government.  A high-level government panel is also said to be working on cryptocurrency legislation that could possibly ban the use of crypto outright, reportedly even handing down prison sentences to those breaking the rule. Earlier reports suggested crypto might ultimately be allowed in law, but under tough rules.  India is Facebook's largest market and is currently seeing a pre-launch pilot of its WhatsApp subsidiary's payment services across 1 million people, said today's report.  However, the tough scenario in the nation regarding cryptocurrencies means Facebook's Libra project will have to eye the market from outside for now.  “Calibra will respect the legislation,” London-based Facebook representative Alexandru Voica told The Economic Times, adding that the social media giant aims to work with local lawmakers to see if legislation can be amended.  While it's early days for the project, the Libra Association is talking to potential ""partners"" across the globe, said Voica, hinting that there may be other use cases for Calibra in India.  He said  “The blockchain project has multiple uses in smart contracts, supply chain management and so on – it’s not just for cryptocurrencies.”  Facebook image via Shutterstock",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/07/10/facebook-says-it-wont-launch-crypto-in-india-due-to-regulatory-issues,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c082cd3619a7ef32e2bc8b1b04296c4a56084785-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403050,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdeU5b,1562722516,Singapore's Stock Exchange Backs New Ethereum Security Token Platform,"A new trading platform for security tokens has launched with backing from Singapore Exchange (SGX), the country's public stock market, and technical support from ethereum startup ConsenSys.  The 1X platform has gone live Wednesday with its first listing of an ethereum token, purchasable with Singapore dollars. The token represents about 7 percent of the shares of a Singapore fund manager called Aggregate Asset Management (AAM).  AAM raised about $4 million in fiat currency in the six weeks since May 4, 2019. Investors in the round received the corresponding ethereum tokens to account for their ownership, which is now tradable on 1X.  The goal of 1X is to provide an IPO-like platform but for private companies to raise capital and to increase liquidity in the primary capital market by using a public blockchain to validate transactions.  ""We take a portion of private companies – usually 10 to 30 percent – and put that into a special purpose vehicle (SPV) ... to back every token we mint for listing and trading,"" 1X's CEO, Haiping Choo, told CoinDesk, adding:  ""The overall idea is to bring liquidity to an otherwise historically illiquid assets. We are starting off with private companies. In the future, we intend to apply the same workflow to other illiquid assets like bonds or real estate, etc.""  Global availability  1X was set up by Capbridge, a Singapore-based exchange for primary market stock offerings. Regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the country's de facto central bank, Capbridge holds a Capital Markets Services license. It also has a Recognized Market Operator (RMO) license for 1X.  SGX, meanwhile, is a strategic investor in 1X, meaning the stock exchange not only has an equity stake but is also involved in business operations.  Each token represents actual company securities, Choo said. ""Currently it’s only ordinary/common shares, but we may extend to other share types e.g. preferred shares and other types of securities such as convertible bonds etc.""  By using the ethereum blockchain to replace the role of a traditional settler, the exchange aims to reduce operational costs and make it available for global participants, in addition to the 1,000 accredited investors on the platform.  While Singaporean traders must meet the threshold of at least $220,000 in annual income and $1.5 million in net worth to qualify as an accredited investor, Choo said there's no minimum requirement for investors from outside jurisdictions as long as they pass the know-your-customer (KYC) process.  For 1X's part, the exchange charges a 2.5 percent transaction fee for each trade and a $3,600 listing fee a year for successful applicants.  Consensys' role  Consensys, the New York-based blockchain software studio started by ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin, helped design a solution for 1X to issue what are called ""modified ERC-20 tokens“ to satisfy interoperability needs and regulatory requirements.  Daren Frankel, director of ConsenSys’ Singapore operations, explained that this design would allow the transactions of the securities-backed ethereum tokens to be visible on the ethereum network like any other ERC-20 tokens.  However, ""it does not give custody of the assets directly to users, as the trading of shares on 1X is subject to a number of compliance checks,"" he added.  That's because all of 1X's listings – both the tokens and underlying securities – are required to be fully stored by a third-party custodian licensed and regulated by the Singapore government. Choo said it works with Equiom Trust Singapore and plans to add more custodians.  In essence, while 1X functions as a centralized exchange, it does not hold investors' private keys, and for every trade inside the exchange, on-chain transactions are required to go through the third-party custodian.  ""When we designed this, we designed it to be a fully compliant, scalable and standardized way to onboard global companies and investors,"" Choo said, ""because the assets we are offering are securities, which are the most highly regulated asset class.""

Preceded by a soft launch, Binance Singapore had seen an average of 20-percent user growth per week since April.  “We are humbled by the positive market response to Binance Singapore thus far, which is largely due to our strategic investment partner,” said Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, CEO of Binance, referring to Vertex Ventures China and Vertex Ventures Southeast Asia and India, part of a 30-year-old group of venture capital funds.  Vertex initially made a strategic investment in Binance in 2018 with the explicit goal of developing a crypto exchange in the city-state. The total amount invested was not disclosed.
