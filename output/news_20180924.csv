42429716,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM0pBh,1537820411,Walmart Tells Produce Suppliers to Use Blockchain by Next September,"Walmart plans to sell leafy greens that are tracked using blockchain technology within the next year.  In a press release published Monday, the world's largest retailer both by revenue and by employee count announced that it told its suppliers for leafy green produce to integrate a blockchain-based tracking system built in collaboration with IBM by September 2019.  According to the letter sent to suppliers, any company working with Walmart must work with the IBM Food Trust network to create end-to-end traceability in two phases. The blockchain platform will make it easier for Walmart to source any food items quickly, with the release noting that tracing such items at present is ""an almost insurmountable challenge.""  The move comes in the wake of an E. coli outbreak that originated in Arizona earlier this year. While authorities at the Center for Disease Control warned consumers to avoid lettuce grown near the city of Yuma, Walmart vice president of food safety Frank Yiannas noted that it was difficult for customers to confirm where exactly their produce was grown.  He added in a statement:  ""None of the bags of salad had 'Yuma, Arizona' on them. In the future, using the technology we're requiring, a customer could potentially scan a bag of salad and know with certainty where it came from.""  The first phase of the roll-out will require direct suppliers to create ""one-step back traceability"" by the end of January. Any companies that have suppliers of their own will then have until the end of September 2019 to integrate the network vertically.  ""To assist you in meeting this new Walmart business requirement, we have worked closely with IBM and other food companies to create a user-friendly, low-cost, blockchain-enabled traceability solution that meets our requirements and creates shared value for the entire leafy green farm to table continuum,"" says the letter.  As previously reported, Walmart has applied blockchain to the food-tracking use case in the past, most notably in a bid to shore up the quality of pig products in China.

42429725,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM0pRh,1537815983,"Regulation News Still Moves Bitcoin Prices, BIS Report Says","A new report from the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) contends that bitcoin markets are swayed by news events related to regulation.  ""While cryptocurrencies are often thought to operate out of the reach of national regulation, in fact their valuations, transaction volumes and user bases react substantially to news about regulatory actions,"" argues the report, which was drafted by Raphael Auer and Stijn Claessens and was published on September 23.  The full report adds to the growing body of research conducted by the BIS – considered by some to be the ""central bank's central bank"" – on the subject of cryptocurrencies and blockchain.  Among the examples cited by the BIS: the news from March 2017 that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had shot down a proposal from investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss to create what would have been the first U.S.-based exchange-traded fund for bitcoin.  ""In the five minutes around the announcement, the price of bitcoin dropped by 16 [percent],"" Auer and Claessens note. ""Another event is the Japanese Financial Services Agency (FSA) ordering six cryptocurrency exchanges to improve their money laundering procedures (June 2018). Again, prices tanked – although it seems to have taken several hours, until the start of the US. trading day, for this measure to have its full effect...""  Included in the report (and posted below) is a graph detailing market developments in the wake of both the SEC and FSA announcements.  But why?  The BIS report goes on to outline other effects that regulation-related news has had on the market, but the data itself begs the question: why is this the case?  Auer and Claessens posit that, in part, this is because of the reliance on regulated exchange points when moving funds from cryptocurrencies to government-issued ones.  ""Part of our interpretation is that cryptocurrencies rely on regulated institutions to convert regular currency into cryptocurrencies. Their cumbersome setup also means that many consumers hold and transact in cryptocurrencies through more interfaces, such as online crypto-wallets that are often regulated, or can be regulated in principle,"" the two wrote, going on to state:  ""And international arbitrage is still limited. Agents cannot easily access cryptocurrencies' markets offshore – because they may need to have a bank account in the foreign jurisdiction. Factors such as these create market segmentation and fragmentation, which currently make national regulatory actions bind to some degree.""  Simply put, the report contends that such an impact suggests that regulations themselves can have an effect on the cryptocurrency space.  ""Our analysis shows that despite the entity-free and borderless nature of cryptocurrencies, regulatory actions as well as news regarding potential regulatory actions can have a strong impact on cryptocurrency markets, at least in terms of valuations and transaction volumes,"" the authors later conclude.

Under the deal, Coinbase Pro will integrate Caspian's ""full stack"" of tools to bring additional trading and portfolio management capabilities, according to a Caspian Medium post published Monday.  Kayvon Pirestani, director of institutional sales at Coinbase, said in the post:  ""Customers will be able to take advantage of the best elements of both platforms – accessing Coinbase's extensive historical market data and deep pool of liquidity, and combined with Caspian's suite of seamless trading tools.""  More than just a commercial opportunity, the partnership is an opportunity to ""move forward the institutional adoption of crypto as a mature, tradable asset class,"" Pirestani added.  Caspian – which offers what it says is an ""institutional grade full-stack crypto trading and risk management platform"" – currently connects to 25 crypto trading platforms, including Coinbase, Gemini, Bitfinex, Poloniex, Huobi, OKEx and Binance.  As reported by CoinDesk, Caspian was launched just days ago as a joint venture of Kenetic, a crypto firm based in Hong Kong, and Tora, a trading systems firm that already supplies order execution, portfolio management, risk assessment and compliance services for well-established asset classes. The project has already raised $16 million in funding via a token presale.  The firm said the partnership with Coinbase is part of its strategy to ""connect institutional investors and active traders with multiple trading platforms from a single interface.""  As part of its aim to bring cryptocurrency to the mainstream of finance, Coinbase also announced in June that it was making moves to become a federally regulated broker-dealer.  The firm indicated at the time it was attempting to acquire several companies – Keystone Capital Corp., Venovate Marketplace and Digital Wealth LLC, – to ease the process of acquiring a broker-dealer license, an alternative trading system license and a registered investment advisor license.  Once those are in place, the company said it aims to seek approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) to offer blockchain-based securities.

Written by Thomas Hardjono, director of the MIT Trust: Data Consortium, the report summarizes the results of a series of roundtable meetings held by the Congressional Blockchain Congress – a group of lawmakers in the U.S. Congress who advocate for the tech – in 2017 and 2018. The meetings were spearheaded by Representatives David Schweikert and Jared Polis, and aimed to understand potential use cases for blockchain as well as accelerate use cases of the tech, according to the report.  Specifically, the three meetings each had a different focus: digital identity, payments and supply chain and provenance. The report explained that ""strong industry consensus exists around the belief that blockchain technology will be the leading edge of 'next Internet' economy.""  The report added:  ""It is imperative that government and industry work together to continue and strengthen technological and market leadership in this new area, and to address potential policy and regulatory incompatibility that may constrain growth of the emerging digital-blockchain economy.""  As such, each meeting's goals were to better explain use cases, find common interests, speed up the deployment of the technology, establish what might prevent adoption and find components which may be used across businesses or industries.  The report explained that attendees from the meetings came to three ""overarching common themes."" Namely, that participants believe there needs to be ""leadership and vision from the government,"" that there should be ""close collaboration between industry and government"" and that there must be ""increased research and test-bed deployments.""  ""Currently there is a need for greater vision and leadership across government regarding the development of technology for a digital-blockchain economy, and the U.S. role in this future economy,"" the report stated. ""Industry leaders believe this technology will be core to the future of the economy as a whole, just as the Internet has become.""  Call for public resources  The report did not provide specifics on the attendees or which projects they may have represented.  However, representatives from Ripple, Sweetbridge, Joust Bank, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, Microsoft's Decentralized Identity Foundation, the Sovrin Foundation, the Linux Foundation and IBM all gave presentations at one or another of the meetings.  Further, there were few repeat attendees at each meeting, the report stated.  It concluded that ""more resources need to be allocated toward this nascent yet rapidly evolving technology, much in the way the U.S. government-funded early research into the internet in the 1970s and 1980s.""  ""It was this support from [the] government, combined with a shared vision for a U.S. leadership role in initial internet communications technology, that allowed the internet to flourish with broad adoption and become the foundation of the digital economy today,"" it said.

""ASIC is taking further action in respect of one completed ICO,"" the agency added without offering additional details.  Such work was highlighted earlier this year when ASIC said that it was contacted ICO issuers and putting a stop to ones it deemed deceptive toward investors.  Commissioner John Price said at the time that those who solicit investors for token sales have obligations – a sentiment that he expressed in last Thursday's release.  ""If you raise money from the public, you have important legal obligations. It is the legal substance of your offer - not what it is called - that matters,"" Price was quoted as saying. ""You should not simply assume that using an ICO structure allows you to ignore key protections there for the investing public and you should always ensure disclosure about your offer is complete and accurate.""

42429700,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM0oth,1537794009,HODL No More? The Amount of Bitcoin in Active Wallets Is Near Record Highs,"An increasing amount of bitcoin is being held by active individual users, rather than companies and long-term investors, according to new data from Chainalysis.  Announced Monday, the analytics firm found 4.8 million bitcoin, or roughly 32 percent of the protocol's cryptocurrency supply (minus lost coins), was held in personal wallets with some level of transactional activity as of August 31. That's up substantially from the end of 2017 – around the time the market peaked – when just 3.8 million bitcoin, or 26 percent, was in the hands of individuals.  The August numbers were the second-highest for individual accounts on record, and off only slightly from July's high of 4.95 million bitcoin, or 33 percent of all coins in circulation.  ""There are more people who are holding crypto personally,"" Chainalysis economist Philip Gradwell told CoinDesk.  As a result, Gradwell said, ""there's a much larger supply that's liquid. A lot of the people who bought [this year] are buying smaller amounts,"" adding:  ""They are ready – if things were to change, [if] the opportunity to spend it were to arise – to actually spend it. We've kind of overcome the first hurdle of adoption, getting bitcoin into people's hands.""  Speaking to that potential, Gradwell said technical solutions aimed at improving bitcoin – like the much-lauded Lightning Network, which could enable faster payment processing options for merchants and service providers – could tip the scales for users deciding whether to transact with bitcoin or cash out during the next bull market.  To be sure, bitcoin is still predominantly held as an inactive investment, whether custodied by an institution or individual, with 6.3 billion held in accounts that had no activity in over a year, according to Chainalysis data.  Further, one person can control multiple wallets, so the data is an imperfect proxy for the adoption and distribution of bitcoin.  And the original cryptocurrency's deflationary supply and dramatic appreciation in its 10 years of existence tend to incentivize users to hold rather than spend, all else equal – many bitcoin proponents view this as a feature, not a bug.  'A maturing market'  Whether bitcoin users are transacting with personal wallets or exchange accounts, Chainalysis economist Kimberly Grauer said the monetary aggregates for these categories have stabilized, suggesting news articles don't spur as much dramatic trading activity as they did last year.  ""You don't see wild fluctuations in the wealth between [investment accounts and active transactional accounts],"" she told CoinDesk, adding:  ""This is a sign of a maturing market with less volatility.""  Further, Chainalysis found that, from August to December, the amount of bitcoin held by service providers like exchange platforms increased by just 93,299. When viewed in light of the roughly 1 million bitcoin added to personal wallets over the same period, this implies the number of people using self-custody solutions is increasing at a faster rate than that of mere speculators.  Adoption by merchants, legitimate or otherwise, is a different story. Gradwell said activity across various payment processing services and darknet markets hasn't risen at the same rates as overall wallet activity, although it's impossible to say how much activity represents peer-to-peer commerce.  Gradwell described the current state of bitcoin wealth distribution as slightly more diverse, in part, thanks to long-term investors selling to new speculators late last year and earlier this year.  Out of roughly 28.5 million bitcoin wallets across the market, he estimated only 150,000 of them hold more than 10 bitcoin each.  Gradwell concluded:  ""Half of available bitcoin is still held by investors, but it has gotten somewhat less concentrated.""

42429721,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM0pFh,1537790444,'500 Transactions a Second': Vitalik Says Zk-Snarks Could Scale Ethereum,"A form of cryptography pioneered by zcash might help scale ethereum, the founder of the platform Vitalik Buterin said on a research forum Saturday.  Named zk-snarks, Buterin wrote that by using the tech, ethereum can potentially scale ""by a huge amount,"" up to 500 transactions per second, without relying on layer-two scaling solutions, such as Plasma or Raiden. As detailed by CoinDesk, zk-snarks allow for large batches of information to be compressed into so-called succinct proofs, which remain the same size regardless of the amount of inputs.  Buterin wrote:  ""We can actually scale asset transfer transactions on ethereum by a huge amount, without using layer 2s that introduce liveness assumptions (eg. channels, plasma), by using zk-SNARKs to mass-validate transactions.""  Continuing, Buterin describes a method that includes a ""relayer"" node, a kind of computer that performs the task of aggregating transactions in exchange for transaction fees.  ""Anyone can be a relayer; there is no assumption of even an untrusted special 'operator' existing,"" Buterin added.  As a result, he estimated that such a setup could lead to gains of ""~24x for ETH transactions and ~50x for ERC-20 transfers.""  The proposal comes at a time when pressure is mounting on ethereum researchers to find ways to increase the transaction capacity of the platform. For example, a tweet by Parity communications officer Afri Schoedon on Friday urged developers to ""stop deploying dapps to ethereum. We are running at capacity.""  In response, Buterin tweeted that zk-snark scaling solutions might alleviate the pressure faced by the ethereum blockchain.  In Saturday's forum comments, Buterin also said that, while aggregating transactions with zk-snarks is computationally intensive, the technology is likely to improve in the future.  ""I understand that the above requires some quite heavy duty computing work on the part of the relayers,"" Buterin wrote, concluding:  ""But at this point it's widely known that optimizing snark/stark provers is super-important so I'm sure there will be more and more software engineering work going into it over time.""

42429728,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM0pVh,1537786844,$6.9K Is the New Price to Watch for Bitcoin Bulls,"Bitcoin has pulled back from 17-days highs clocked over the weekend and risks losing bullish bias if prices close below $6,600, technical studies indicate.  A break below that level will make it far harder for the bulls to force a major upside breakout above the crucial resistance at $6,970. However, if prices hold above $6,600 in the next 24 hours, that target may be achievable.  The leading cryptocurrency was solidly bid on Friday likely due to an increased investor interest in XRP and other alternative cryptocurrencies. Notably, prices flew past $6,600, confirming a double bottom bullish reversal and opening doors to the psychological support of $7,000.  However, the altcoin rally fizzled out over the weekend. For instance, XRP, which was reporting a 75 percent gain at $0.77 in the US hours on Friday, fell back to $0.50 just a day later and is currently threatening to drop below that level.  Further, Friday's other big gainers like aurora and monacoin shed a major chunk of their gains over the weekend.  As a result, the rally in BTC was cut short at a 17-day high of $6,841 on Saturday. At press time, the cryptocurrency is changing hands at $6,610 on Bitfinex – down 1.8 percent on a 24-hour basis.  Daily chart  Over on the daily chart, a sustained break below $6,600 (neckline support) would invalidate the bullish setup indicated by Friday's double bottom breakout.  It's worth noting that the cryptocurrency found takers below that level on Saturday. So, the bears may want to see back-to-back UTC closes below $6,000 before jumping the gun.  Should the cryptocurrency defend $6,000 in the next 24 hours, then the top edge of the pennant pattern, currently located at $6,970, could come into play.  Weekly chart  The weekly chart shows that BTC created a bullish outside-week candle last week, adding credence to the persistent defense of $6,00–$5,800 range over the last three months.  As a result, the odds of BTC rising to the pennant resistance of $6,970 in the near-term are high.  View  A UTC close below $6,600 (double bottom neckline) would invalidate the bullish setup.  The pennant resistance of $6,970 could be put to test soon if prices hold above $6,600 in the next 24 hours.  A UTC close above the pennant hurdle of $6,970 would strengthen the bullish grip and allow a rally to July highs above $8,500.

For the effort, Italy's Juventus Football Club, which boasts Cristiano Ronaldo as a current team member, is teaming up with Socios.com to launch the ""Juventus Official Fan Token."" The token will be initially distributed via a ""Fan Token Offering (FTO),"" according to a press release Monday.  With one of the largest global fan bases of any soccer club, and a huge social media presence, the team says it intends the Fan Token to expand that audience even further, and allow supporters outside Europe to have a more direct experience.  The token, which will be tradeable on the Socios platform against its native $CHZ token, will allow the fans to vote over an upcoming mobile app. With the platform, fans can respond to Juventus ballots, allowing supporters' ""voice to be heard, and creating an emotional connection between the Club and its fans,"" the club says.  The Fan Token Offering – which we're guessing is basically an ICO , though the release didn't indicate exactly how it would be structured or how much it is intended to raise – is slated for launch in Q1 2019.  Giorgio Ricci, Juventus' co-chief revenue officer, head of global partnerships and corporate revenues, said:  ""At the club we are always very careful and pro-active towards innovation and new technologies. Together with Socios.com, we believe we can offer new opportunities to our worldwide fan base to engage in cutting-edge way with their favorite club.""  The announcement comes amid a recent spate of soccer clubs turning to blockchain tech to try and engage further with their fan-bases.  Just two weeks ago, top French league team Paris Saint-Germain, revealed plans to issue its own cryptocurrency as a way to incentivize participation from its fans around the world. That project is also being conducted in partnership with Socios via a similar Fan Token Offering.  In fact, Socios indicated in today's release that it hopes to engage with more soccer clubs, possibly as many as 50, going forward.  ""Our ambition is to build the world's biggest global football community and marketplace for football fans alongside demonstrating that blockchain and cryptocurrency is the trusted technology of the mainstream,"" said Alexandre Dreyfus, the firm's CEO and founder.  Brazi's Avaí Futebol Clube, a Series B soccer team, announced Sept. 12 that it is creating a cryptocurrency as part of an effort to develop a digital ecosystem for its fans and raise $20 million. The project is aimed to help it develop in order to qualify for the top Series A tier of Brazilian soccer and to build up the team's physical infrastructure.

42429723,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM0pNh,1537776035,"Regulators Land Punches, But There's a Long Fight Over Crypto Ahead","Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk's advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT's Digital Currency Initiative.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.      There are shifts at ShapeShift and not everyone's happy with them.  When the token exchange recently announced a new ""membership"" model with mandatory account identification, there was outrage from certain members of the cryptocurrency community who felt it was abandoning its pledge to privacy and destroying its core value proposition.  Bitcoin developer Peter Todd, for one, was brutal:  ShapeShift described the move as a way to provide added perks to loyal customers and to explore approaches to tokenizing that loyalty. But it was clear that the threat of action by regulators played a big hand in the move.  In a blog post announcing the move, CEO Erik Voorhees, a prominent crypto libertarian and vocal proponent of individuals' rights' to private value exchange, acknowledged to his customers that the mandatory aspect of the new model ""sucks."" And in a reply to crypto developer Greg Slepak's suggestion on Twitter that he write an ""honest blog"" about what happened, Voorhees responded by saying ""What I write is being watched very closely. Please give us time.""  But in a statement provided to CoinDesk, Voorhees offered further explanation for ShapeShift's policy shift. He said an official know-your-customer (KYC) identification system ""was not added a result of any enforcement action, but rather a proactive step we took to derisk the company amid uncertain and changing global regulations.""  ""We remain committed to the struggle for financial privacy and sovereignty for all humans,"" he said, but added,  ""Ultimately, ShapeShift is a corporate entity, and we have to abide by laws around the world. ""  New York's AG Office Enters the Fight  Now, with the New York Attorney General's office releasing a report accusing various crypto exchanges of doing too little to prevent market manipulation, one could conclude that regulators are gaining the upper hand in their ongoing battle with the crypto industry's more anarchic elements.  Along with the capitulation at ShapeShift, long viewed as a model for those wanting to conduct exchanges outside of the state surveillance ingrained in KYC identification regimes, it does look as if officialdom is striking some heavy blows right now.  But this will be a long struggle, a boxing match, if you will, that still has many rounds to go. New technologies, the dynamic development of token-based business models and an evolving regulatory landscape will continue to create avenues for blockchain and cryptocurrency developers to protect privacy and challenge government intervention.  That, in turn, will spur regulators to pursue new enforcement approaches to maintain their power, which will be followed by new solutions from the crypto side to deal with those efforts. It's hard to say who will win in the end. Perhaps it will never be resolved.  Some of the battle comes down to defining and managing jurisdictional boundaries — and that doesn't necessarily go in favor of the regulators.  Crypto technology is, for example, ensuring that the New York Department of Financial Services no longer has the de facto global reach it wielded under the previous assumption that any decent financial entity had to operate in the New York market. The reason old-style financial companies felt compelled to submit to NYDFS rules was that the most important financial intermediaries — the investment banks, the correspondent banks, the custodians and so forth — were based in the state. But crypto technology is explicitly intended to bypass those intermediaries and create peer-to-peer exchange.  This is why exchanges like ShapeShift and Kraken felt comfortable opting out of the New York market when they decided that NYDFS's BitLicense was too onerous. They could simply choose not to deal with residents of the state — much to the chagrin of the New York Attorney General's office, which called the exchange's refusal to cooperate with its request for information ""alarming.""  We'll have to see if there's any negative fallout for Kraken CEO Jesse Powell, who mockingly responded to the NYAG's report by comparing the state to ""that abusive, controlling ex you broke up with 3 years ago but they keep stalking you, throwing shade on your new relationships, unable to accept that you have happily moved on and are better off without them."" However, Powell's bravado suggests Kraken is confident it has successfully shut itself off from New York residents and so can, effectively, tell the state's officers to take a flying leap.  Ironically, Kraken is able to derive that confidence because of sophisticated technological new tools for managing customer accounts that KYC compliance officers call for — such as monitoring IP addresses, which can indicate if someone trying to trade on the exchange's site is in New York.  New Pro-Privacy Tools  Meanwhile, advances in cryptographic privacy are coming thick and fast, with blockchain developers making strides with tools such as zero-knowledge proofs. Cryptocurrencies such as zcash, monero and dash all enjoy these qualities.  And within Bitcoin Core, work is being done to make it near impossible to trace transactions — a goal that's critical, not so that criminals can exploit cryptocurrencies, but so that enterprises that might want to use these technologies don't expose corporate secrets to their competitors.  ""Layer 2"" solutions such as the Lightning Network, which allow for transactions to occur ""off chain"" will also enhance the privacy of cryptocurrency users. Meanwhile, related solutions such as discreet log contracts, which essentially blind information oracles from information about the contracting parties they serve, will create extremely private smart contracts and could encourage crypto ""dark pools"" whose transactions are invisible.  And of course, there's a big push toward decentralized exchanges. Lawyers often point out that these models are still vulnerable to regulatory oversight, since the developers of the software can be held accountable. But once powerful price discovery systems, atomic swap mechanisms and safe custody models are built so that buyers and sellers can find each other without intermediaries, what's to stop a new ""Satoshi Nakamoto"" from anonymously bequeathing such a system to the world and avoiding the clutches of the law?  The Law Is the Law, Though  Still, it's naïve to suggest that government doesn't have powerful weapons. If activities that take place on these systems are deemed illegal, then participants must engage them in full knowledge that they are breaking the law. And if they're caught doing so, prison is always a possibility. That threat can be a strong, moderating force on behavior.  The powers of the state are far-reaching. With the implicit threat of jail time or fines, it can force businesses to spend heavily on legal fees and compliance costs without even taken any action. Voorhees told CoinDesk that ShapeShift spent ""over a million dollars of legal expenses on this topic"" before making the decision to change policy.  So, in reality, we don't know who the ultimate winner is in this crypto-versus-regulators fight.  But perhaps this back and forth can have a positive outcome if it sparks a dialogue around the best way to permit innovation and the degree to which privacy needs to be protected. As I've argued elsewhere, privacy should be viewed as a key element of an effective system of exchange, without which money can cease to fungible.  That's why it's encouraging to see policy makers in various jurisdictions try to give more leeway to innovators in this industry.  On Friday, Rep. Tom Emmer of Illinois, a new co-chair of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus, announced he would introduce three new bills providing safe harbor protections with lightweight regulatory models for blockchain startups. And we're seeing jurisdictions like Singapore open up a constructive global dialogue on how to encourage innovation in areas such as utility tokens without leaving developers to fall afoul of securities laws.  Such frameworks can give a lease of life to those building a more frictionless, liberal system of value exchange. It could even provide opportunities for ShapeShift, whose new accounts model includes some interesting opportunities in tokenized membership, which could facilitate experiments in disintermediated and decentralized exchange, even within the confines of a KYC regime.  So, grab yourself some popcorn. This is going to be a long one.  Boxing image via Shutterstock.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Michael J.

42429703,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM0oxh,1537761708,Crypto Exchange ShapeShift's CEO Says Move to Collect IDs Was 'Proactive',"Cryptocurrency exchange ShapeShift's controversial decision to require user identities wasn't forced upon it but signified a ""proactive"" step to reduce legal risks, according to CEO and founder Erik Voorhees.  In comments to CoinDesk made over the weekend, Voorhees offered some hitherto unshared rationale behind a move that prompted criticism from some in the cryptocurrency community who'd seen the site's prior policy of not requiring formally identified accounts as a way to protect privacy.  Some had speculated that ShapeShift's new, soon-to-be mandatory ""membership"" model – announced in early September – was the result of direct or indirect threats from regulators. (This speculation may have been fueled in part by Voorhees' own tweet in which he described the new customer ID system as ""something we're building under duress."")  But Voorhees, a vocal libertarian advocate of privacy rights and a critic of know-your-customer (KYC) regulations, told CoinDesk that ""KYC was not added as a result of any enforcement action, but rather as a proactive step we took to de-risk the company amid uncertain and changing global regulations.""  He added:  ""It was a strategic decision as we believe the risk of not doing so had gotten too great. It was not made lightly.""  Voorhees said the firm had spent ""months of legal work and over a million dollars of legal expenses on this topic alone. That is money and time that would've been better spent building things to protect and serve customers.""  While his comments confirm that regulatory considerations were a driving factor in the decision to make account identities mandatory, Voorhees framed it as a later addition to a program originally developed as an optional feature.  ""KYC was thus stuck on to the Membership platform, and while optional membership and account-based features are certainly desired by many of our customers, there is nobody (including us) who desires forced KYC,"" he said.  'We remain committed'  In a Twitter exchange that occurred after Voorhees published a blog post a few weeks ago detailing the ""tokenized"" membership model as a way to provide special perks for loyal users, critics said he should have just shut the company down rather than compromise his pro-privacy principles.  But in his statement to CoinDesk, the ShapeShift CEO reiterated that he made the change with the utmost reluctance as a steadfast opponent of government surveillance in monetary affairs.  ""We remain committed to the struggle for financial privacy and sovereignty for all humans, and will continue to be tactical about how we further that cause,"" he said.  ""The status quo is to invade the privacy of millions of innocent people in order to potentially decrease the risk of a few bad actors. We think this is both unjust and ineffective,"" Voorhees went on to say, citing an estimate by the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime that 2 percent to 5 percent of global GDP is laundered each year. ""The current system is a failure by any measure.""  In a closing remark, however, Voorhees conceded:  ""Ultimately, ShapeShift is a corporate entity, and we have to abide by laws around the world.""
