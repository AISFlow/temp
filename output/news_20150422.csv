42426348,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJMc3h,1429735259,Brock Pierce Elected Bitcoin Foundation Board Chairman,"Venture capitalist Brock Pierce has been named chairman of the board of directors at the Bitcoin Foundation, the digital currency's oldest trade organisation.  Pierce was elected to the position by a 3-0 vote Tuesday, with board member Olivier Janssens abstaining. The 34-year-old was nominated by board member and BTC China CEO Bobby Lee, with whom Pierce was elected to the foundation in May of 2014.  In interview, Pierce indicated that his role will now be to work with newly appointed executive director Bruce Fenton as he shapes the nonprofit's 2015 strategy and works to create consensus on how the Bitcoin Foundation can move forward on rebuilding its image.  Pierce told CoinDesk:  ""A lot of us believe in the foundation and we believe it can be effective at advocating on behalf of the industry. Some people might say there are aspects that are broken. I say it's a lot harder to be part of the solution than the problem, that's why I ran for the board.""  The election follows weeks of heated debate about the future of the organisation among its board members, its membership body and the wider digital currency community.  Further, it comes on the heels of an announcement by MIT Media Lab today that it had formally hired three core developers previously supported by the foundation.  Common alignment  Throughout the interview, Pierce strived to suggest that the board of directors, including its newly elected industry members, are eager to put recent disagreements in the past and find a ""common alignment"".  Tensions first flared in early April, when board member Olivier Janssens took to social media to alert the community of the foundation's financial state.  Still, Pierce voiced his desire to work with all current board members on a path forward, one that would find the body disclosing its decisions faster and with greater transparency.  ""I have a strong desire to work with everyone on the team,"" Pierce said. ""We were all elected by the membership, and it's our job to figure out how to come together and collaborate.""  Pierce said he foresees the Bitcoin Foundation board remaining comprised of both individual and industry members, even as it becomes a more general interest group, adding that there are no plans to change its organisational structure.  Continued focus  Pierce downplayed the significance of the appointment in the context of his career in the bitcoin industry, one that has so far been plagued by controversies stemming from past allegations of improprieties.  ""I'm certainly someone that has devoted pretty much all of my time and energy to this sector as a whole in supporting the entrepreneurs and businesses that have been started in this space and advocating for the industry on a global basis,"" he said. ""This is what I do already.""  The investor has contributed to funding rounds both through venture firm Crypo Currency Partners and through a personal AngelList syndicate.  However, Pierce stressed that the role was a non-paid position and that this would simply require more time and energy on his part, a proposition he said he only accepted with some trepidation and with the knowledge that someone would need to step up and shoulder the work for the greater good.  ""Someone's got to do it,"" he concluded.

42426334,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJMbdh,1429731016,EU Securities Watchdog Calls for Information on Blockchain Tech,"UPDATE (27th April 11:05): Comment added from Dr Timo Schlaefer, co-founder and CEO of Crypto Facilities, a bitcoin derivatives trading platform.      The EU's securities watchdog has issued a call for evidence to ascertain if and when blockchain technology can ""enter the financial mainstream"".  The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), which oversees securities markets in the region, has spent six months monitoring investment in the bitcoin sector.  Now the regulator is seeking feedback from industry stakeholders on how the technology underlying cryptocurrencies can be used to ""issue, buy and sell and record ownership of securities"".  The ESMA said in a statement:  ""ESMA is interested in how different virtual currencies and the associated blockchain, or distributed ledger, can be used in investments. There are now facilities available to use the blockchain infrastructure as a means of issuing, transacting in and transferring ownership of securities in a way that bypasses the traditional infrastructure.""  Use beyond currency  The ESMA is asking industry stakeholders to assess its document and answer 10 questions about the types of crypto-securities and investment products in use, as well as elaborate on the associated risks and rewards they pose for investors.  The documents name a number of ""collective investment schemes"" operating worldwide, including Jersey hedge fund GABI and Bitcoins Reserve, a cryptocurrency arbitrage fund in the British Virgin Islands.  Bank to the Future  CEO Simon Dixon, who has been heavily involved in the UK's crypto-crowdfunding sector, told CoinDesk he was pleased that the ESMA was starting to recognise that blockchains have use beyond currency.  However, more details should be given about what the organisation wishes to use the contributions for, he said.  Dixon remarked:  ""No doubt ESMA's call for information will be about introducing tighter regulations into blockchain financial markets, but perhaps it will result in more transparent and fair financial markets being developed to stimulate innovation.""  ""Anything that improves access to finance for startups is a good thing,"" he added.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Dr Timo Schlaefer, co-founder and CEO of London-based bitcoin derivatives broker Crypto Facilities, was equally pleased that ""educated players"" were showing interest in the sector. He confirmed that his company will be among those responding to the ESMA.  ""We will ... outline our view on how securities on digital assets should be structured so as to minimise the risk for market participants, in particular credit risk and operational risk,"" Schlaefer said.  He added:  ""We think regulation would be beneficial if it enhances the protection of market participants and as long as it does not place unreasonable burdens on the space or hampers innovation.""  The UK Treasury issued its own Call for Information last November to ascertain how best to regulate digital currency companies and protect consumers.  After receiving more than 120 responses, the government outlined a series of landmark plans including anti-money laundering (AML) regulations and £10m in research funding to coincide with the Chancellor of the Exchequer's annual budget speech. Feedback from the country's crypto startup community was widely positive.  According to the ESMA document, all contributions it receives will be made public, unless requested otherwise. The deadline for responses is 21st July 2015.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,Grace Caffyn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/04/22/eu-securities-watchdog-calls-for-information-on-blockchain-tech,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b5824e9c710ffcd626584740b9634c25a7a8a597-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Lawsky anticipates the final version of the BitLicense regulatory framework will be released sometime before the end of May.  Speaking to reporters on 21st April during a Dow Jones risk and compliance conference in New York City, Lawsky noted that his office is in contact with other state regulators and is watching how both domestic and foreign regulation of digital currency activities takes shape.  “We’re going to see how this all shakes out. I think there’s room for federalism, but at the same time if you have a whole series of different rules and it becomes a crazy quilt patchwork, that can get hard to comply with,” he said.  Last week, a NYDFS representative told CoinDesk that the NYDFS plans to release the final version of the BitLicense ""very soon"" but did not provide a specific date at the time.  Proposals for the BitLicense, which will regulate bitcoin business activity in the state of New York, were first released last year and have since been revised over the course of several comment periods.  The proposals have sparked debate among entrepreneurs and community members over the degree to which such activities should be regulated.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/04/22/lawsky-bitlicense-will-be-finalized-by-end-of-may,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png
42426344,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJMbzh,1429716527,Bitcoin and Blockchain Up for Debate at FutureMoney Conference,"Bitcoin’s consumer appeal and the technical promise of distributed ledgers were hotly debated topics during yesterday's FutureMoney event, held in Canary Wharf, London.  The Blockchain and Beyond panel, moderated by Richard Brown, executive architect for banking industry innovation at IBM, consisted of Jon Matonis, founding member of The Bitcoin Foundation and prominent bitcoin advocate; Chris Gledhill, technologist at Lloyds Banking Group; Robert Sams, CEO of Clearmatics and Mark Smargon, founder of startup Colu.  Brown kicked off the discussion with an attempt to reach consensus on whether digital ledgers such as the blockchain were superior to bitcoin as a currency.  Matonis set out to defend bitcoin as a monetary unit, noting that the separation between the two was a ""cliché"". He was also quick to disregard its unstable price, adding that markets for crude oil and silver were just as volatile.  The majority of necessary work will take place on the blockchain, he said, because that is where the computational power is:  “I am not saying that it is the only game in town, but I am being a realist and saying that the computational power, the resilience of the hashing is far and away the leader.”  Smargon weighed into to the debate clarifying that the term bitcoin was fairly definitive, whereas blockchain continued to be somewhat vague.  Despite initial optimism about bitcoin's growth, Gledhill seemed to side in 'camp blockchain': “I talk to a lot of my peers and we all get really excited about the intricacies of how the blockchain works as a disruptive potential,"" he said.  Sams echoed the sentiment of many naysayers who claim that bitcoin is still in its infancy, adding:  ""There are a lot of interesting ideas included in the bitcoin protocol, but … it is going to go through iterations or should go through iterations of innovation before the powerful use cases are found.""  Consumer adoption  With this in mind, the panel moved on to discuss consumer adoption. Gledhill said that the cryptocurrency space had yet to see ""that killer app"" that would set the tone for future use cases.  Unsurprisingly, the technologist spoke of risk adversity and his bank’s role in safekeeping customers’ funds. He said:  ""If you are putting your life savings into a bank you expect us to be responsible. I think with new technologies there is that importance for banks to assess [them] to ensure they are not putting our consumers at risk.""  Gledhill continued: ""So unless there is a killer use case for customers that is above what they are using at the moment, then I don’t believe they want it [bitcoin],"" concluding, ""it doesn’t solve a problem and its potential could introduce risk, so why would we adopt it?""  Matonis countered that bitcoin adoption was not going to take place in the developed world. Instead, its real potential lies in parts of the world such as Africa or Argentina, he said, where monetary issuers are unstable and a large of part of the population is unbanked.  Storing digital assets and smart contracts  One area of conversation focused on whether or not tokens on a blockchain will come to represent real world assets and obligations.  ""Right now bitcoin is not an efficient way of storing data, but also storing valuable data in a centralised database poses certain requirements that may be even more complex,"" said Smargon, adding: ""We are also researching use cases which are not financial, because the concept is so big.""  Looking to the future, Colu’s co-founder said that bank hacks would increase, and that this security issue would drive the financial institutions to bitcoin. However, he added that existing technology was not yet sophisticated enough to overcome these issues.  Gledhill seemed unconvinced by the proposal of a decentralised register being used to transfer money, although he did note that blockchain technology was a good way of tracking assets.  He was also vocal about how the buzz around blockchain technologies had created a ""real pressure"" to take business cases and move them on to the ledger, sometimes unnecessarily.  The panel agreed than not all use cases require decentralised solutions, or anonymous validation. However, Sams added:  ""The global state of who owns what is arrived at through layers of reconciliation, message passing – it takes days. Whereas, with distributed consensus you can reach global consensus in minutes.""

Executives from some of Europe’s top banks, including RBS, Lloyds Banking Group, Intesa Sanpaolo and Santander, also discussed the disruptive potential of distributed ledger systems during a wide-ranging discussion on innovation in banking.  Towards the end of the panel, moderator Mateo Rizzi, general partner at SBT Venture Capital, questioned whether banks have a fear of missing out rather than a ""desire to embrace a radical change"".  Belinky, who noted that distributed ledgers could ""transform"" banking, replied: ""We are all very aware that trust is shifting. We [banks] are on the defensive. FinTech and innovation have been accelerated in the last 5 years or so. It’s the topic of the hour.""

42426336,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJMbjh,1429714053,Bitcoin Core Developers Join MIT Digital Currency Initiative,"The MIT Digital Currency Initiative is stepping up to take a larger role in bitcoin development, announcing today that core developers Gavin Andresen, Cory Fields and Wladimir van der Laan have joined the project in a full-time capacity.  Andresen, Fields and van der Laan had previously been supported financially by the Bitcoin Foundation, an industry trade group that has been in the midst of pivoting due to funding constraints.  MIT Digital Currency Initiative director Brian Forde expressed his view that the move would help bring stability to developers, an environment he suggested had been lacking in recent years as the foundation was rocked by scandals.  Forde told CoinDesk:  ""Our goal from day one is finding ways to support digital currency and cryptocurrency. Obviously there are different ways to do that, one way is providing stability to core developers in a neutral place. Our hope was in offering them positions we would be able to offer a stable place with resources so they can focus on code.""  Andresen outlined the transition in a blog post, stating that the developers collectively thought MIT Media Lab was the best place to continue their work.  The developer also moved to make his views known about the wider debate that recently emerged around core development.  ""The Bitcoin Foundation was never the center of development; the bitcoin core open-source software project has been the center, and like most open-source software projects, the developers who work on bitcoin core are supported in many different ways,"" he wrote.  The post ended with Andresen thanking those who had expressed support during the recent transition period and expressing his enthusiasm for the new opportunity to continue his work.  International network  In interview, Forde expanded on how he envisions the Digital Currency Initiative's role in core development, suggesting that it will seek to leverage the resources available to MIT.  ""To the extent possible, we'd like to get more students working with core developments, not just at MIT but at large,"" Forde said.  Forde further hinted that MIT is ""not the only university"" interested in digital currencies, and that one of his goals will be to build a global network of educational facilities.  ""Our interest is not to make this a US-only effort. We've been reaching out to international universities to incorporate them,"" Forde said, adding:  ""We just launched last Wednesday, so little by little we're getting there.""

42426350,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJMcBh,1429707617,OKCoin Superwallet Outlines New Blueprint for Bitcoin Industry,"OKCoin, the largest Chinese yuan (CNY) bitcoin exchange by volume, has announced the launch of an ambitious new wallet product it hopes will encourage the wider industry to rethink its attempts to reach mainstream consumers.  Dubbed the first 'Superwallet', the OKLink desktop wallet, currently in beta, promises to combine the best of both fiat mobile wallets and traditional bitcoin wallets. In effect, the Superwallet will allow users to spend BTC, CNY or US dollars at bitcoin-accepting merchants, converting fiat currency to bitcoin only at the point of sale as a means of transmitting the payment and settling the transaction.  The conversion will come at no additional cost to the user, who will pay a bid/ask spread on the purchase as they would when initiating a purchase with BTC. OKCoin will continue to cover mining fees, while fees for those who use its traditional exchange to access bitcoin as a speculative asset will remain unchanged.  Jack Liu, head of OKCoin's international division, suggested that the launch of the Superwallet would mark one of the first attempts to encourage the use the bitcoin protocol as a payments rail without requiring users to interface with its currency directly.  Overall, he cautioned that the release is still a beta, and that the wallet is, for now, only as strong as the wider ecosystem with which it will need to interact. However, he expressed optimism that more bitcoin companies would be encouraged to adopt a similar approach when developing future efforts.  Liu told CoinDesk:  ""The Superwallet is not branded as a bitcoin currency product. It will highlight the powerful open protocol which will allow users to spend their chosen currency using the bitcoin protocol in the same way the native tokens of the protocol can be spent.""  Superwallet users who wish to transact in BTC will still be able to do so, a feature Liu believes will maintain the company's appeal to bitcoin users while providing benefits to a larger pool of customers.  ""It removes the need to believe in deflationary money supply, decentralization, certain political leanings or the need to stay abreast of industry trends or currency movements,"" Liu added.  FinTech focus  The news comes on the heels of a slew of signals that the formerly trading-focused company was seeking to enter the consumer market. CEO Star Xu first hinted the company was on the verge of shifting focus at The North American Bitcoin Conference (TNABC) this January in his inaugural US appearance.  OKCoin went on to experience a string of departures that saw CTO Changpeng Zhao and product manager Zane Tackett leave abruptly for competitors or new endeavors. However, Liu said the Superwallet concept is unrelated to the exits, reiterating that his company is still equally focused on continuing to improve its exchange product.  Liu did, however, suggest the company is on a new path forward in his comments, framing OKCoin as a financial technology company that is more broadly interested in solving problems for mainstream consumers.  ""We want to show we're innovative, that we're not just about speculation,"" Liu continued. ""Bitcoin is an important, important, important part of our FinTech company, but we're trying to solve problems.""  Liu's comments suggest a frustration with an industry that he implied was too focused on onboarding consumers to bitcoin as a currency.  ""This type of thinking is a little narrow, how to help bitcoin users try to avoid volatility. There's this other community that wants to have an CNY or fiat wallet and think of a bitcoin address as a zip code or payment code,"" he said, adding:  ""I don't think the average person wants to be looking at updates from Gavin Andresen and whether he put in new block sizes.""  Limitations for users  At launch, Liu sees the Superwallet as more useful to its domestic Chinese users, who can connect bank accounts directly to the product, something US users are not able to do.  Still, he said there are workarounds for those who are willing to go through the current levels of friction to initiate USD purchases on the bitcoin network.  ""You would buy bitcoin somewhere, including potentially OKCoin, and move the bitcoin to your USD wallet. So you don't have to have a bitcoin wallet, just a USD wallet,"" Liu explained.  From there, Liu said users can scan bitcoin QR codes with their wallet to pay with fiat at the point of sale. Such new activity, he contends, would bring added liquidity to the network in a boon for bitcoin users.  ""We're not changing the network. Anyone who wants to use bitcoin can keep using bitcoin,"" Liu added.  For now, though, he suggested the OKLink wallet is lacking refinement for English-language users. Translations for OKLink are still in development, Liu said, as are supporting versions of the product, such as iOS and Android editions.  Domestic market competition  While a change in the thinking of one large bitcoin exchange, it could be argued the Superwallet approaches concepts already being explored by other players in the wider digital currencies space that have attempted to move fiat currencies using open ledgers.  Pushing back against these comparisons, Liu argued that payment networks such as those developed by Ripple Labs are still centralized, meaning tokens function as IOUs.  In this light, Liu framed the Superwallet as an effort that seeks a similar usability while relying more on the bitcoin blockchain as a means to transmit fiat.  ""If I send CNY via bitcoin to Circle, Circle owns this BTC and can get exactly the value of USD for that BTC. It does not owe any exposure to me or to any other party. Fiat should be transferred through a decentralized core and OKCoin has committed to that core being bitcoin,"" he said.  In this way, Liu suggested OKCoin could also compete in China, a market that has traditionally not be viewed as one where bitcoin can win a share of the payments space.  Liu attacked this idea as well, contending that despite the low fees charged by Alipay or UnionPay, OKCoin can appeal to Chinese users who need to transact internationally.  ""WeChat is a closed payment system. When a WeChat user arrives in a foreign country for example, he or she will need to install a new wallet,"" Liu argued.  Building an ecosystem  Ultimately, Liu envisions an ecosystem where bitcoin serves as the rails for international payments and companies like OKCoin act as the on and off ramp for users to convert in and out of different fiat currencies.  He stressed that the ecosystem needs to come together to enable this economic activity. For example, Liu noted that, today, OKLink users would not be able to send USD to a Circle wallet and have that user receive USD on the other end.  However, Liu did outline examples of how OKCoin's Superwallet could be useful for users of the bitcoin payroll service Bitwage.  ""Now a Chinese person can get Bitwage and the bitcoin goes to a CNY wallet, and they get paid automatically in CNY,"" Liu explained.  Liu also indicated that he doesn't see the Superwallet as a viable consumer spending tool at present, given the limited number of merchants on the protocol. For this effort, Liu acknowledged the support of companies like Coinbase and BitPay is needed.  With this goal in mind, Liu ended by calling on the industry to join together for what he characterized as the greater consumer good, concluding:  ""Everyone in this industry should be embracing this concept.""

The process is being overseen by exchange Kraken, appointed to assist Mt Gox's bankruptcy trustee Nobuaki Kobayashi last November.  According to instructions posted on the Mt Gox homepage, account holders have until 29th May (Japan time) to fill out forms directly from the site, or open an account with Kraken and begin from there.  The online claims process is available as the large majority of Mt Gox's 100,000 creditors live outside Japan, enabling them to participate more easily in the bankruptcy process.  Those who cannot supply a Mt Gox username or password will need to complete the process offline, mailing a printed form instead.  Bitcoin payouts possible  With a Kraken account, users are able to request a payout in bitcoin. Those who do not have a Kraken account, or do not wish to open one, would have to receive any payout in fiat currency.  It is still not 100% certain that distribution in bitcoin is possible, but the trustee says it is investigating.  Kraken is also offering up to $1m in free trades to creditors claiming funds through its system.  Ayako Miyaguchi, Kraken's managing director for Japan, said there is still some misunderstanding as to whether claiming in fiat or bitcoin is preferable.  ""There is no advantage to holding fiat over bitcoin, or taking a payout in fiat over bitcoin. Everything is considered in terms of its value in Japanese yen, and everyone will get their pro rata share of that number. There is an advantage with bitcoin, however, when you consider withdrawal fees, which of course will be much lower for bitcoin compared to fiat.""  The bitcoin value listed on the claims form is $483, which it specifies is taken from the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index at 23:59 on 23rd April 2014, Japan time.  To complete the process, users will need to supply their personal information, Mt Gox account information including the amounts claimed, and bank details (to help verify that the account is genuine).  Mt Gox customers have for some time been able to log into the exchange with their former username and password to see their exact bitcoin balances in fiat.  Third creditors' meeting  At the third Mt Gox creditors' meeting held in Tokyo today, it was announced that the company's total remaining assets had been valued at 1.376bn JPY ($11.5m). This is roughly 60m JPY ($504,000) more than had been stated at the previous meeting.  The difference was collected from ""money deposited with other companies"", according to a statement, including 35.3m JPY from one ""foreign payment service provider"".  Total current bitcoin reserves are listed as 202,159 BTC.  In another twist, the trustee claimed that Mt Gox still has loan receivables of over $136.17m against CEO Mark Karpeles. Karpeles has so far not presented a repayment plan, prompting the trustee to state he was considering taking ""necessary legal action"" to resolve the issue.  Realistic expectations  In a statement, Kraken CEO Jesse Powell said his company's philosophy is to put customers' best interests first.  ""We see our involvement in this process as an opportunity to restore faith in the community by showing what we need more of in the bitcoin space – trusted leadership.""  Posting on Reddit, Powell cautioned that no one would likely receive the full value of their account balance at the time of Mt Gox's collapse in February 2014.  Anyone who read the most recent Wizsec report on the missing coins, he wrote, probably would not expect to receive any more than 20% back. The report noted that Mt Gox had less than 100,000 BTC in its system after June 2013.  The total amount creditors could claim would be known after two months of claims applications and another two for the bankruptcy trustee to evaluate the claims. The result would be known ""sometime in September or October"".",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/04/22/trustee-opens-formal-claims-process-for-mt-gox-customers,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9607e474f81f2dfebef94abf991f911452ea7b94-1572x968.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
