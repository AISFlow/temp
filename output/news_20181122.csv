42402254,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3jpD,1542897315,Norway Ends Power Tax Subsidy for Bitcoin Miners,"The Norwegian government has scrapped a tax subsidy on power currently granted to bitcoin miners.  Some Scandinavian countries charge tax on electricity consumption, including Norway. According to a report from local news outlet Aftenposten, in its state budget, the government said that cryptocurrency miners in the country will have to pay normal electricity tax from the New Year.  At the moment, larger mining firms receive the same electricity tax discount as other power-intensive industries in the country. Those with a capacity of more than 0.5 megawatts are charged only 0.48 øre ($0.00056) per kilowatt hour instead of the standard rate of 16.58 øre ($0.019). An øre is 100th of a Norwegian krone.  That means that eligible miners have been paying just 2.8 percent of the standard tax rate to power their rigs.  ""Norway can not continue to provide huge tax incentives for the most dirty form of cryptographic output like bitcoin. It requires a lot of energy and generates large greenhouse gas emissions globally,” Norwegian parliamentary representative Lars Haltbrekken said in the report.  Now with an end to the subsidy, bitcoin miners will have to shell out higher taxes, which is likely to reduce their net profits at a time when low crypto prices are already putting pressure on the industry.  Just this Monday, U.S.-based bitcoin mining firm Giga Watt declared bankruptcy, revealing in court documents that it still owes its biggest 20 unsecured creditors nearly $7 million. That number includes claims to hundreds of thousands of dollars by two power providers to the firm.  The suggestion to remove Norway's subsidy was reportedly proposed by the Norwegian Tax Administration, an agency under the authority of the country’s Ministry of Finance. That proposal has now been approved in the state budget and will be effective from January 2019.  Roger Schjerva, chief economist of tech industry interest body, ICT Norway, told Aftenposten:  “This is shocking. Budgets have changed framework conditions without discussion, consultation or dialogue with the industry,”  Removing the subsidy will push crypto miners to Sweden and Denmark, he argued, adding that the country mustn't ""just say no to income and work in many municipalities in Norway.”  Editor's note: Quotes have been informally translated from Norwegian.

Spanish banking giant BBVA announced Tuesday that it and four other banks have joined the EC's planned International Association for Trusted Blockchain Applications (IATBA), which could be a legal entity as early as first quarter of 2019. While the remaining banks were not named in official announcements, some sources say Santander is also one of the group.  The initiative was announced at a recent EU blockchain roundtable event called ""Bringing industries together for Europe to lead in blockchain technologies,"" held on Nov. 20 in Brussels, Belgium.  The new association will have representatives from both public and private sectors with an aim to “garner support from private blockchain and [distributed ledger technology] experts to contribute to outline the EU’s strategy regarding these technologies,” the BBVA said.  The association is aimed to develop guidelines and protocols for the blockchain industry, and promote the EU's blockchain standards internationally. It will further provide information for the implementation of Europe’s blockchain strategy.  Carlos Kuchkovsky, BBVA’s head of research & development for new digital business, said that the association could have an important role to play in terms of “establishing blockchain best practice and standards and at avoiding fragmentation on a European level.”  Kuchkovsky also believes that the EC initiative will help provide more clarity to the “regulatory uncertainty” that currently surrounds the use of blockchain tech.  He added:  “Blockchain is not only a technology, but it engenders new business models creating a tokenized economy and paving the way to a decentralized economy in the future.”  As part of its moves to adopt and develop blockchain across the economic bloc, the EC in April formed the European Blockchain Partnership (EBP) along with 27 member countries to support the delivery of cross-border digital public services.

42402257,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3jrB,1542888000,Swiss Railway Tests Blockchain Identities for Workplace Safety Boost,"Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) has completed a proof-of-concept (PoC) of a blockchain-based credentials management system for workers employed at the company’s construction sites.  The project ran from May to November, and aimed to improve upon the current manual, paper-based processes in an ""agile working environment with a digital, audit-proof solution based on blockchain,"" Daniele Pallecchi, the Swiss national rail company’s spokesperson, told CoinDesk via email.  “Construction sites on the SBB network often involve third parties. For safety reasons, there are strict requirements regarding the qualification of personnel,"" Pallecchi said, explaining the need for a robust identity system.  The solution was developed by a blockchain startup Linum Labs using the open-source technology of uPort, a project started under the umbrella of New York-based ethereum design studio ConsenSys.  In the proof-of-concept, workers created their digital identities in the uPort app on their mobile devices, and SBB issued them certificates confirming they went through appropriate training.  The workers then used these digital IDs while signing in and out of construction sites where they worked. To enter the site, a worker would scan a QR code from the app on his or her cellphone.  “Using uPort, railway workers, certification authorities and supervisors are able to have their own unique digital identities linked to their respective uPort ID’s, which is then anchored to an identity on the blockchain. A hash of the worker’s check-in / check-out activities is published to the blockchain so that the internal database can be audited,” Linum Labs wrote in a Medium post.  The app can also connect to identity systems authorized by city administrations, like Zug ID, which also uses uPort's tech. It was trialed this summer in the Swiss city of Zug to enable electronic voting via blockchain, and now is involved in another pilot: local residents can use Zug IDs to unlock bikes provided by AirBie, a Zurich-based bike-sharing startup.  SBB’s Pallecchi declined to give any specific details about next steps, adding that the company “may have more stable information” in the beginning of 2019.  New approach  uPort hasn’t been directly involved in the railway project, in accordance with the startup’s open-source ethos, its head of product, Thierry Bonfante, told CoinDesk. “Our partners are representing our system on the market. We’ll just make sure that they have all they need from us,” he said.  However, while the railway pilot was underway, in August, uPort upgraded its architecture to address scalability and privacy concerns, moving more operations off-chain. As uPort is based on ethereum, which has struggled to scale, doing every operation on blockchain was making the system slow and ineffective, Bonfante said.  Another issue that prompted the change at uPort: it was difficult to comply with the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) implemented in May. The regulation includes a “right to be forgotten,"" which is, to demand that information about an individual be removed from the public domain at their request.  “If you always put your information on the blockchain it’s irrevocable,” said Bonfante. “So you have lost your right to be forgotten.”  With the new architecture of uPort, users' personal information is stored off-chain, on their mobile phones. In the case of the Swiss railway, ""blockchain is only used for additional key management purposes, such as key rotation, revocation and delegation to third parties,"" Bonfante explained.  The system works well for small amounts of information, uPort’s director of business operations, Alice Nawfal, told CoinDesk. But in the future, as the market gets to the point where more complex identity applications will be in demand, “it probably will not work on a phone,” so uPort is looking into creating a storage hub solution, Nawfal said.  She added that SBB “really grasped” the opportunities of the verifiable credentials technology.  “Before this, the use cases were, for example, that people were able to identify that they are residents of a particular city,"" Nawfal said.

42402260,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3jv7,1542884482,$4.6K: Bitcoin's Price Revival Has a New Target,"Bitcoin's (BTC) stalled recovery rally could kick off again if prices manage to beat new resistance above $4,600.  The leading cryptocurrency by market valuation picked up a bid after hitting 14-month lows near $4,000 on Wednesday, possibly due to record oversold conditions reported by the 14-day relative strength index (RSI).  The corrective rally, however, seems to have run out of steam as the cryptocurrency is currently trading at $4,460 on Bitstamp – down 3.78 percent from the high of $4,635 seen yesterday.  That said, the probability of a fresh sell-off is low, as the RSI on both the daily and 3-day charts is still reporting oversold conditions.  Meanwhile, the odds of BTC extending the recovery rally would improve substantially if prices clear $4,635 – the high of yesterday’s “bullish inside-day” candle – a widely followed pattern that represents an indecisive market.  Daily chart  An inside-day candle occurs when BTC's daily price range falls within the price range of the previous day.  As seen above, yesterday's price range (high minus low), as represented by the green candle, falls within the trading range witnessed on Tuesday.  With an inside-day candlestick considered a sign of indecision, the market could see either trend reversal or trend continuation afterwards.  Accordingly, an inside-day bullish reversal would be confirmed if BTC finds acceptance above yesterday's high of $4,635 in the next 48 hours or so, while a break below the previous day's low of $4,242 would imply bearish continuation.  That said, BTC is more likely to witness a bullish reversal, as the candlestick pattern has appeared at the bottom of the recent sell-off and more importantly, the RSI is still signaling oversold conditions.  The current oversold status of the cryptocurrency means that a bearish continuation could turn out to be a short-term bear trap.  It is worth noting that the 5- and 10-day exponential moving averages (EMAs), currently located at $4,722 and $5,103, respectively, are still trending south. As a result, BTC may have a hard time holding on to gains above the psychological hurdle of $5,000.  View  An inside-day bullish reversal could be seen in the next day or two. The immediate upside, however, could be capped around $5,000.  An inside-day bearish continuation could turn out to be a bear trap, as the cryptocurrency is still looking oversold.  A weekly close below $4,182 (200-week EMA) would revive the bearish view and open up downside toward the next major support located at $3,100 (200-week simple moving average).

According to France-based radio station Europe 1, tobacco retailers will be offering bitcoin vouchers in denominations of 50, 100 or 250 euros (around $57, $114 or $285) from Jan. 1, 2019.  Local crypto startup Keplerk is said to have signed a deal with a cash register software provider to facilitate the scheme. Keplerk will allow customers to convert their vouchers into bitcoin and store it in wallets on its platform.  Initially, some 3,000–4,000 tobacco shops will be selling the vouchers, with others likely to be added later on, the report states.  “Tobacco shop owners are the best channel as they are trusted by customers and they are used to sell vouchers such as credit for mobile phones,” Adil Zakhar, Keplerk’s director for strategy and development, was quoted as saying by Reuters.  Keplerk will charge 7 percent commission on transactions to fund the operation, the news source adds.

It further warned that cryptocurrencies are “purely speculative and are not currencies” and that those who wish to invest in bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency “do it entirely at their own risk.”  There are 25,000 tobacco outlets across France, according to the tobacconist federation's website, potentially making bitcoin widely available if the scheme is a success.  The news comes as bitcoin is experiencing a significant downturn in prices. The oldest and largest cryptocurrency by market value, which peaked at nearly $20,000 last December, is trading around $4,500 currently after losing around $1,000 in less than a week.

42402245,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3jgM,1542862821,There Is No 'Bitcoin': What the SEC Doesn't Get About Cryptocurrency,"Edan Yago is the founder of CementDAO, an effort to bring together stablecoins into a unified ecosystem. He previously was the CEO and co-founder of software firm Epiphyte and helped set up the industry associations DATA and the Stablecoin Foundation. The views expressed here are his own.    ----------------------------    The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been gone to significant lengths in an attempt to understand the crypto asset space. This effort is to be applauded. However, the SEC has failed to come to terms with one fundamental aspect of crypto assets and systems.  Namely, properly constructed crypto systems do not involve ""persons"" or ""entities"" and do not represent a form of property. For this reason, they do not have any analogue in the traditional financial world, nor can they fall under financial regulation.  In the traditional financial world, assets are a claim on a specific property. For example, a commodity, shares in a company or a debt owed.  Crypto assets, however, are not a claim on anything. What is bitcoin a claim to? Or ether?  Instead, crypto assets are a form of proof. They are cryptographic proof that a specific set of mathematical functions has been performed. They are proof that certain software instructions have been performed and of the algorithmic outputs of that software. And crucially, the mathematical functions are performed by nobody in particular, they are performed by the network as a whole.  Property is ""ownership determined by law."" Crypto assets are not property because they are not determined by law – they are determined by maths. This presents some obvious issues when it comes to figuring out exactly how to regulate them.  There is no bitcoin  Many people today speak of cryptocurrencies in the shorthand of property. They say things like ""Alice transferred a bitcoin to Bob,"" but we shouldn't let this metaphor confuse us.  In actual fact, there was no bitcoin that existed anywhere and it didn't move from any one place to another.  In ""The Matrix,"" Neo understood the true nature of the world when he understood that ""there is no spoon."" Likewise, we can only understand the true nature of blockchain when we recognize that ""there is no bitcoin.""  Instead, what really happened is that Alice proved to Bob that she had certain secret knowledge and that she had used that knowledge to perform a mathematical operation. But wait, the rabbit hole goes even deeper.  Even ""Alice"" and ""Bob"" are misleading fictions. Alice is not necessarily a person, that is shorthand too. Alice is really only an address – an output of a hash function, that may or may not be associated with a specific ""entity.""  Now, of course, sometimes Alice is a person. And sometimes Alice created a ""token"" (another metaphor) and sold it to Bob as an investment. In which case, arguably that was a securities offering and can be regulated by the SEC.  However, the SEC doesn't stop there. The agency wants to regulate what happens to those tokens, as they interact with smart contracts too. In its November 16 ""Statement on Digital Asset Securities Issuance and Trading,"" the agency says:  ""Any entity that provides a marketplace for bringing together buyers and sellers of securities, regardless of the applied technology, must determine whether its activities meet the definition of an exchange under the federal securities laws.""  An ""entity"" here refers to a legal person.  As an example, they use EtherDelta, and specifically its smart contract, saying:  ""EtherDelta's smart contract was coded to, among other things, validate order messages, confirm the terms and conditions of orders, execute paired orders, and direct the distributed ledger to be updated to reflect a trade.""  Here is where taking metaphorical thinking can easily go too far, and where the SEC is introducing vague and problematic language. EtherDelta, as an entity, provided various services (such as a webpage user interface for interacting with the smart contract). EtherDelta also developed the smart contract.  But who ""provided"" the smart contract? Who performed its functions? Not EtherDelta or anyone else in particular.  The SEC might regulate the EtherDelta website but to attempt to regulate the smart contract is a result of confusion.  The rabbit hole goes deeper  This confusion gets worse when the SEC talks about secondary markets for these ""securities.""  Crypto assets are so new that even many experienced practitioners are confused and think that they represent a distinct property. As a result, as an industry, we have been far too willing to indulge the SEC view that since something was the product of a securities offering, it remains a security thereafter. Once we realize that there are no ""tokens"" and no ""property,"" we realize that this is a categorical error.  It becomes easy to see this error when one imagines the following scenario: Bob, having purchased the tokens from Alice sends them to a smart contract owned by nobody. He has given up claim of ownership – which would mean that no legal entity owns the ""security.""  By definition, a security is an ""investment contract."" A contract is ""an agreement between legal persons, creating obligations that are enforceable by law.""  So for something to be a security, it must, therefore, (a) be between legal entities and (b) be enforceable by law (not math).  Tokens held by smart contracts fail both these tests. They cannot properly be described as securities. However, the SEC is suggesting something radically new: that a set of instructions which involves no agreement, no persons and is not enforced by law (but rather by math) can yet still be viewed not just as a contract but as a security. This is a radical departure from existing law.  Property laws and financial laws rely on enforcement by governments. Since there are many governments and their jurisdictions are limited, there is no truly global system of enforcement that is appropriate to the borderless world of the internet.  A huge potential benefit of crypto assets is that they overcome this problem -- by not being a product of law or limited to its jurisdiction.  The SEC, for obvious reasons, would like to establish jurisdiction over crypto assets. However, this jurisdiction is only appropriate where there are legally enforceable contracts between legal entities.  For the SEC, or anyone, not to recognize this important distinction is a recipe for overreach and confusion. It has the potential to rob many of us for the benefits of a truly global, digital method of managing ownership and value.
