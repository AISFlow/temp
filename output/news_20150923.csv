42398680,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgMJV,1443045308,BitPay Cuts 'Free and Unlimited' Bitcoin Processing for New Merchants,"BitPay will no longer offer its ""free and unlimited"" introductory service to new merchants looking to accept bitcoin as payment.  First introduced in July 2014, the plan sought to help the startup reach its goal of enrolling 1 million merchants by 2017.  At the time, executive chairman Tony Gallippi described the plan as ""free and unlimited"", stating that such a pricing scheme would continue ""forever"" in a bid to entice merchants to the platform.  The announcement marks a break from the 0% transaction fee model BitPay has sought to market since late 2013 when it introduced a Professional Plan, Business Plan and Enterprise Plan for customers.  In statements, Gallippi framed the shift as one that would be unlikely to affect small merchants accepting payment via the service.  Gallippi said:  ""The new Starter Plan will remain free for up to $1,000 daily and 30 transactions per month, giving many small businesses more than enough access to our platform for their needs.""  Further, he downplayed the idea the change would have a substantial impact on customers, adding that ""nearly all merchants"" processing enough transactions chose to upgrade to a paid subscription package.  Starter Plan customers who process more than 30 transactions a month, the company said, would be charged a 1% fee on additional transactions. Likewise, subscribers to the company's Business Plan aimed at enterprise users will now be charged a 1% fee based on use, rather than a $300 recurring monthly cost.  ""The new plan will lower the risk of experimenting with bitcoin acceptance for mid-sized businesses, while enabling our team to better focus on Business Plan merchants,"" a blog post stated.  The pricing change, the company said, was made following improvements to the platform including a new payments dashboard and upgraded refund and invoice adjustment tool.  Enterprise Plan customers, in turn, will see no changes to their contract pricing model.  Disclaimer: CoinDesk founder Shakil Khan is an investor in BitPay.

42398675,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgMGY,1443034529,Charlie Shrem Talks Prison Life and Bitcoin's Future in Ongoing AMA,"Former BitInstant CEO and Bitcoin Foundation board member Charlie Shrem is now conducting an ongoing ask-me-anything (AMA) session from Lewisburg Federal Prison Camp in Pennsylvania.  Shrem, who was arrested in early 2014 for violating anti-money laundering laws while at his bitcoin exchange startup, began serving a two-year prison sentence earlier this March. Since then, the always-outspoken advocate for the technology has been silent on new developments in the industry.  However, in the ongoing AMA, hosted by Bitcoin.com, Shrem opened up about a range of topics including the ongoing debate over bitcoin's block size, adjusting to prison life and why he believes the transparent nature of the bitcoin blockchain will lead to more repressive government regulation.  Shrem spoke at length about why he believes government will eventually lead to the creation of three classes of bitcoin: white bitcoins, those that meet regulatory requirements; gray bitcoins, those that have not been identified by the government; and black bitcoins that are blocked by the bitcoin mining network.  Shrem wrote:  ""If the government is able to discover that you possess black bitcoins or process blacklisted transactions, you could even be seen as a someone committing a crime. Eventually Bitcoin will become a fast payment system without counterparty risk but with full government control. Is that what we really want?""  Elsewhere, he weighed in on the ongoing debate about how bitcoin should be changed to process greater transaction volumes, calling on the community to avoid ""leaving things as is"".  ""One of the most important strengths bitcoin has is its ability to adapt and now is the time to do it,"" Shrem said, adding that he hopes to start or join a bitcoin company when he is eventually released from incarceration.  Further, he discussed the events that led to his sentencing, calling his actions ""irresponsible"". ""I don't blame anyone but myself and every day I think about all the people I let down,"" he added.  Shrem indicated he plans to answer questions every weekday from 18:30 BST to 20:30 BST, and more regularly on the weekends.  Personal life  Shrem also spoke about his personal life behind bars, reporting that he's already read 70 books while serving as a general education development (GED) teacher for other inmates.  ""I take classes about life, lifestyle balance, rational thinking, living with others, yoga and others. I cook a lot, workout every day, walk or run on the track and play sports,"" he wrote.  On the subject of education, Shrem also reported to teaching inmates about bitcoin, including the more nuanced areas of the technology such as sidechains and alternative distributed ledgers such as Ripple.  ""Many people here even owned bitcoin before they came in,"" he said. ""We have a lot of programmers here, finance guys, doctors and economists.""  Shrem said he is also teaching himself Spanish and that he hopes to spend time outside of the US when he is eventually released.

42398692,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgMWI,1443016821,KeepKey Launches New Bitcoin Hardware Wallet,"KeepKey's new USB bitcoin wallet has gone on sale, enabling consumers to store their bitcoins offline.  The wallet, which is on sale for $239, allows users to overcome the security problems that come with storing bitcoin on a computer or using third-party custodians.  Speaking about the new product, Ken Heutmaker, a software engineer at KeepKey, said:  “The KeepKey security model was designed to ensure that the user always has complete control over their private keys. We feel that relying on trusted third parties degrades the security and privacy that the bitcoin ecosystem offers.""  How does it work  To set up the KeepKey wallet, users need to install a Google Chrome extension on their browser.  Once the device is plugged into a computer, the user's machine will prompt them to insert a pin number, which will have to be re-entered before every transaction takes place.  KeepKey's wallet then displays the user's private key on its screen. This, however, will only be shown once so users are advised to write the recovery sentence down and store it in a safe place.  When spending bitcoin online, the user will see the KeepKey software pop-up on screen and automatically populate the transaction details.  After inserting the pin number, the device will sign the transaction before automatically broadcasting it to the bitcoin network.  Competition  KeepKey's product is one of many bitcoin hardware wallets available to consumers.  Ledger's Nano, which retails for €34.80 ($38.76), is a multisig bitcoin wallet which can also be plugged into a computer's USB port. Speaking to CoinDesk at the time of launch, the team behind the affordable device claimed their product was almost immune to hacking attacks.  Developed by SatoshiLabs, the Trezor hardware wallet, priced at $99, also enables users to bypass third-party bitcoin storage services.  New York-based bitcoin hardware wallet provider Case – which has raised $2.25 million in seed funding to date – also offers a $199 device for pre-order, which includes security features such as biometric authentication.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Yessi Bello Perez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/09/23/keepkey-launches-new-bitcoin-hardware-wallet,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9e7e739289c4adfb827e3adfda7b93402bd8cd24-1500x622.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
