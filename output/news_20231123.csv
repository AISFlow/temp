20612308,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=562194,1700778652,From Crypto To Catch: Disgraced FTX Founder Turns To Trading Fish In Prison,"According to a report by Business Insider, Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), co-founder and former CEO of FTX, has adapted to the economic system of New York’s Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC), where he is currently awaiting sentencing on multiple felony counts. The disgraced crypto-billionaire has reportedly been bartering, using food as currency in exchange for various services within the prison. Former FTX CEO SBF Trades Fish For Services Per the report, mackerel, a fish commonly referred to as “macks” among inmates, emerged as the currency of choice in federal prisons after cigarettes were banned. The fish’s popularity stems from its stability and value within the prison economy. Formerly incarcerated individuals like attorney Larry Levin have accepted mackerel as payment from fellow prisoners, using it to acquire services such as beard trims and shoe shines. The demand for mackerel became so significant that suppliers, including Global Source Marketing, witnessed increased sales, according to Business Insider. Related Reading: AVAX Holders Beware: $204 Million Token Unlock Could Trigger Price Crash Today In a prison environment where inmates lack access to traditional or digital currency, products with steady value, such as certain food items and stamps, serve as substitutes for money. Mackerel and other stable commodities like tuna become a means of exchange, with their value pegged to the dollar. This economic logic allows inmates to engage in various transactions while maintaining a semblance of a barter system. The use of fish as a medium of exchange in federal prisons has been widespread since 2004, following the cigarette ban. Sam Bankman-Fried faces sentencing on March 28, 2024, for charges that include wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering, with a potential prison term of up to 110 years. Additionally, SBF is set to stand trial for separate counts related to political bribery.

20608816,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=562122,1700773229,"Analyst Says Ethereum Is Seeing ‘Systemic Buying’, What This Means","A CryptoQuant Analyst has identified a significant systemic buying trend in Ethereum, suggesting a rising influx of strategic investments into the blockchain network. Analyst Reveals Ethereum Systemic Buying Trend A crypto market observer and a contributing analyst at CryptoQuant, Maarten Regterschot has taken to X (formerly Twitter) to publish a systemic buying trend he witnessed in Ethereum. The analyst presented a chart indicating that one or more investors have been engaging in Time Weighted Average Price (TWAP) buying on Ethereum futures. Related Reading: Grayscale Files Updated Spot ETF As Bitcoin Barrels Past $37,000 Regterschot stated that the linear increase in open interest in Ethereum suggests that there has been systemic buying of ETH assets for an extended period of time. He revealed that approximately $700 million has already been added to the market. “Someone(s) are TWAP-buying on Ethereum futures. This linear growth in open interest indicates systematic buying over a certain period. There is $700 million added so far,” Regterschot said. Systemic buying in this context involves crypto investments made at regular and periodic intervals. TWAP on the other hand is the measure of an asset’s average price over a specific time period. This systemic buying trend suggests a growing demand for ETH by investors over a long period. The trend also coincides with the latest Ethereum developments in the crypto space, including the growing applications on Ethereum Spot ETFs and its potential approval by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The analyst has not revealed insights into the motives behind this systemic buying of Ethereum. However, the developments could become a catalyst for a potential bullish momentum for Ethereum (ETH). ETH Price Holds $2000 Mark The price of Ethereum has seen multiple upticks within the last few months, allowing the cryptocurrency to finally cross the $2,000 mark. According to CoinMarketCap, Ethereum’s price is up by 2.3% and trading at $2,062 at the time of writing. Although its overall market capitalization is down by 23.31%, the cryptocurrency has been experiencing a fair amount of price increases recently. Related Reading: Cardano Forecast: Crypto Analyst Identifies The Event That Could Send ADA Price To $11 As the potential approval of Ethereum Spot ETFs by the US SEC looms next year, many investors are currently holding their crypto assets as they gear up for a possible bull run. There have also been several optimistic price projections for the ETH token. Some analysts have predicted that the price of the cryptocurrency will reach $2,250 if it succeeds in crossing multiple resistance levels.

20605241,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=562164,1700767849,"Trader: Bitcoin Will Inevitably Breeze Past $70,000—Here’s Why","Taking to X on November 22, crypto chartist @MortensenBach presented a bullish outlook for Bitcoin (BTC), predicting that not only will the coin breeze past $70,000 in the coming months, but it will set a new all-time high, fanning demand for stocks of Bitcoin mining companies like Riot Blockchain, Marathon Digital, and the rest. Bitcoin Trading Above The 20-Period MA In The Monthly Chart The chartist pointed to Bitcoin’s historical tendency to launch parabolic advances following decisive breaks above its 20-month simple moving average (20 SMA) in the monthly chart. As of late November 2023, Bitcoin has been firm. As evidenced in the monthly chart, buyers build on gains recorded in October when prices shook off losses and increased. This upswing was triggered by broader market optimism, which supported crypto prices. With prices now trending firmly above the dynamic reaction line in the monthly chart, the trader believes a bull market is on the cards, and Bitcoin is set for more gains in the coming sessions. Besides the break above the 20-month MA, the analyst notes a growing bullish momentum, according to MACD, a technical indicator. Related Reading: HTX Recommence Operations After Temporary Halt Due to Hack Still, it should be noted that, despite the analyst’s optimism, technical indicators in use, the MACD and MA, lag. Accordingly, there is no guarantee that prices will edge higher, rising from spot levels to nearly double above $70,000 in 2024 and months ahead. As of November 23, BTC prices are firm above $37,000 and more than 2X from November 2022 lows when prices plunged below $16,000. Moreover, it is yet to be seen how stocks of Bitcoin mining companies like Riot Blockchain will perform in the next stage after halving. However, historical performances show their stock tends to rally in lockstep with spot BTC prices. Whales Are Accumulating, Will BTC Surge? Even so, @MortensenBach’s preview analysis ties closely to on-chain insights relayed by CryptoQuant, a blockchain analytics platform. According to data, more whales are moving their BTC from exchanges in large tranches. With big players showing confidence and backing Bitcoin, it could suggest that they expect prices to edge higher. This outlook if further buoyed by developing fundamental factors, including regulatory action and general investor sentiment.

Solana Shakes Off Setbacks, Positioned As Top Crypto To Buy Bitcoin BTC), the most prominent cryptocurrency, has experienced a remarkable 120% surge in 2023. After a long wait for Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approval of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), recent developments indicate that a Spot Bitcoin ETF could finally get the green light by January, as many in the crypto community have predicted, according to Ehrlich. Related Reading: HTX Recommence Operations After Temporary Halt Due to Hack Introducing Bitcoin ETFs is anticipated to generate significant demand from mainstream investors, contributing to a potentially bullish environment. Furthermore, the impending fourth halving event in April, which reduces block rewards and slows down supply, adds to the positive outlook for Bitcoin. While Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, has demonstrated substantial growth historically, its performance this year has been comparatively modest, with a 65% increase. Concerns about regulatory ambiguity in the United States, particularly as it relates to tokens like Ethereum, have dampened investor confidence. In addition, despite a major upgrade aimed at improving efficiency and reducing energy consumption, Ethereum’s growth in key metrics, such as transactions per second and active users, has been underwhelming; for these reasons, Ehrlich believes investors need to hold ETH tokens. Solana (SOL), on the other hand, often referred to as the “Ethereum killer,” suffered setbacks following the collapse of FTX in 2022. However, the stigma surrounding Solana has dissipated, leading to an impressive 313% gain this year. According to Ehrlich, Solana stands out for its “robust technology,” capable of processing thousands of transactions per second and potentially reaching 50,000 transactions per second. As such, Ehrlich believes this is a buy signal for SOL. Binance Coin At Crossroads Binance’s native token, BNB, experienced significant growth, reaching a peak value of $100 billion. However, recent developments, including Binance founder Changpeng Zhao’s guilty plea, substantial fines, and his decision to step down as CEO, have instigated a decline in BNB’s value. While BNB’s utility within the Binance ecosystem and rebate mechanisms for traders may provide some support, concerns arise if traders abandon the exchange en masse. Given these developments, BNB’s future remains uncertain, and Ehrlich believes that BNB could fall even further, stating that investors should consider selling the token. Blur, a marketplace focused on non-fungible tokens (NFTs), has emerged as a strong contender in the NFT market. As the largest marketplace for Ethereum-based collections, Blur rewards users with its native token, BLUR, based on trading volume and provides voting rights for platform governance. Related Reading: XRP On The Verge Of A Surge: Analyst Pinpoints Next Bullish Targets While NFT trading experienced a slump this year, recent signs of recovery, along with notable brands such as Disney and Nike embracing NFTs, indicate a potential rebound. However, Ehrlich believes investors should exercise caution due to the risk of unexpected token airdrops flooding the market. Overall, Bitcoin’s forthcoming spot ETF and halving event, Ethereum’s regulatory challenges, Solana’s technological prowess, BNB’s uncertain future, and Blur’s position within the crypto NFT market are all factors that warrant consideration. It remains to be seen how these cryptocurrencies will react to further developments, and what will be the impacts on their price actions for the last part of the year.

Ali, known for his market predictions, anticipates that XRP is on the brink of a major breakout, potentially escalating to a significant price range shortly. Expert Analysis Of XRP’s Movement Ali Charts has recently turned the spotlight on XRP. In his latest analysis, Ali predicts a promising upturn for XRP, expecting it to break out from its “descending parallel channel.” This optimistic forecast points to a swift climb, targeting the $0.65-$0.66 range. The analysis is backed by a detailed chart Ali shared, elucidating the potential breakout pattern XRP is forming. Related Reading: From Cool-Off To Takeoff: How XRP’s Current Value Signals An Imminent Market Triumph This projection follows XRP’s peak performance on November 6, when it reached $0.72 per token – its highest valuation since late July. Over the following weeks, XRP saw a slow downturn that brought its price to trade as low as $0.58 on Wednesday. However, the recent chart formations, as analyzed by Ali, suggest a potential reversal in this trend. #Ripple | $XRP appears to be breaking out from a descending parallel channel, which may result in an upswing to $0.65 – $0.66 for #XRP. pic.twitter.com/gvfeEMKIDX — Ali (@ali_charts) November 23, 2023 XRP Latest Price Action Meanwhile, XRP has shown signs of a potential reversal from its recent ‘descending parallel channel,’ as indicated by analyst Ali. In the past 24 hours, the token has experienced a 2.9% uptick, climbing from its low of $0.58 seen yesterday to a current trading price of $0.61 at the time of writing. This shift hints at a developing bullish momentum, aligning with Ali’s prediction of an imminent surge beyond the $0.65 mark. Notably, should the token’s price continue this upward trajectory, it could significantly bolster Ali’s analysis, possibly setting the stage for the digital asset to revisit and potentially surpass the $0.72 price level. Such a development would confirm the accuracy of Ali’s forecasts and inject renewed investor confidence in XRP. However, it’s important to contextualize these recent gains against the broader picture. Over the last two weeks, the altcoin has recorded a decline of over 10%, with a 2.7% decrease in the past seven days. This overall bearish trend is mirrored in the trading volume, which has notably reduced.

42419097,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUDeaD,1700757900,Crypto for Advisors: Is Bitcoin for You?,"It's been an active week in the U.S. regulatory space for such a short week. The CEO of Binance steps down as CEO along with a $4 billion settlement with the Department of Justice, the SEC is suing Kraken for operating as an unregistered exchange, and Bittrex Global announced they are shutting down.  The battle for regulatory clarity seems well underway. As bitcoin reached status as the 11th largest market cap for a global financial asset, Zach Pandl from Grayscale takes us through bitcoin in your portfolio.  Happy reading.  – S.M.  You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.  Bitcoin and Your Portfolio  ● Bitcoin is a high-risk and high-return-potential asset with a low correlation to stocks. Therefore, Grayscale Research believes an optimal portfolio for many investors should include a moderate allocation to Bitcoin.  Bitcoin is both a technological marvel and a large, liquid investable asset. And while public blockchain technology can be difficult to understand due to its highly technical nature, the role that bitcoin and other crypto assets can play in a portfolio is fairly straightforward. Crypto markets offer high-risk/high-return-potential assets that haven't been tightly correlated with stocks over a five-year time horizon., and can therefore be useful ingredients for risk-tolerant investors when constructing an optimal portfolio.  Building a diversified portfolio with compelling returns has gotten harder. The classic 60/40 portfolio of stocks and bonds will struggle to produce returns comparable to the last 40 years. We believe there is simply no room for valuations to expand: equity multiples are already high and the secular bull market in bonds is over (attributable to a bottoming in consumer price inflation). Stocks and bonds are also now more correlated, so investors get fewer diversification benefits from pairing them together. Opportunities in public markets are shrinking, too: compared to the 1990s, there are fewer IPOs and the number of listed firms has declined by around 30%.  To address these challenges, investors face a standard menu of options (Exhibit 1). To improve the tradeoff between risk and return in portfolios, they can reallocate to asset classes providing better risk-adjusted returns, lower correlations, or a bit of both. In recent years, for example, certain investors have increased their allocations to alternatives, including illiquid private assets like private equity and real estate. Although this has been a successful approach, these types of vehicles are not available to many individual investors.  Exhibit 1: Traditional assets offer a standard risk/return tradeoff …  Exhibit 2: …. And crypto greatly expands the available options  Crypto assets provide something truly differentiated. From an asset allocation perspective, bitcoin and other digital assets greatly expand the risk/return profile available to public market investors (Exhibit 2). Bitcoin and other crypto assets like Ethereum have high volatilities and should be considered high risk. However, they have produced returns over time commensurate with their risk profile. In other words, while bitcoin has a high volatility; the ratio of its returns to its volatility is broadly similar to other asset classes. Adding crypto assets to a portfolio can therefore be thought of as taking additional investment risk in exchange for higher potential returns. Investors can consider substituting crypto assets for other high risk/high return assets like technology shares, non-U.S. equities, and/or certain illiquid private investments, in order to improve portfolio performance.  Although the crypto asset class has produced high historical returns, it has not been very correlated with other risky assets. For example, over the last five years the correlation between bitcoin and the S&P 500 has been just 40%, compared to a 90% correlation between for the Nasdaq 100 and the S&P 500. A lower correlation to stocks means that crypto allocations in a portfolio should provide greater diversification benefits than certain other pro-risk assets.  Crypto is a nascent young asset class and should be considered relatively high risk. Bitcoin and other crypto assets may not be suitable for investors with defined capital needs in the relatively near future (e.g., within the next three to five years). Savings allocated for upcoming expenses related to college tuition or home purchases, for example, should probably not include crypto allocations. Lastly, investors prioritizing asset income should consider alternative options.  However, for investors with relatively high risk tolerance, crypto greatly expands the risk/return opportunities available in public markets. Because of these assets’ high return potential and low correlation with other risky assets, an optimal portfolio for many investors should include a moderate allocation to crypto.  – Zach Pandl, Managing Director, Research, Grayscale  Ask an Expert  Q: What Impact will a Spot BTC ETF have on the price of Bitcoin?  Bitcoin is one of the few assets that could directly impact the price of an ETF. Since we know there is a limited supply of bitcoin - 21 million total available ever with 19.5 million mined - the demand for a spot ETF will take up some of that supply and have to hold it as long as there is still interest in the ETF. Its a supply and demand situation.  Q: The demand for the ETF might go down, so will the overall price of bitcoin drop?  There could be follow-on effects from a spot BTC ETF approval as it could symbolize a thawing of the regulatory resistance to bitcoin, and possibly to crypto overall. Approval by the SEC for the spot ETF would make investments in bitcoin more palatable for institutions. We may also see more 401k providers allowing bitcoin as an investment option. Overall, the demand for bitcoin could be exponentially larger than the demand for the spot ETF after approval.  Q: I can’t put my clients into bitcoin right now. How can I get them some exposure before the spot ETFapprovals?  There are ways to get exposure to bitcoin before an approval, and still keep the clients in regulated investments within your custodian and AUM. Remember, we’re not giving investment advice, so DYOR.  Some examples include:  GBTC - The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust is trading at a small discount, and will likely be converted to an ETF with the approval of other ETFs. This means clients invested in this trust will get the discount taken up, in addition to any price appreciation in bitcoin.  Bitcoin mining stocks such as - Riot Blockchain and Marathon Digital are publicly traded companies that do nothing but mine bitcoin. If the value of their product increases significantly, logic tells us their stock prices should appreciate as well.  Coinbase - COIN is the publicly traded company that is an exchange and a custodian, and stands to benefit from more interest in crypto overall. They have a diversified revenue model, and the thawing of regulatory stance helps them tremendously.  – Adam Blumberg, Interaxis  Keep Reading  South Korea’s National Pension Fund invested close to $20 million in Coinbase.

This has led to speculations as to what may be driving the token’s rally. One of them relates to a recent event in the crypto industry. FTT Token’s Recent Rally Propelled By Binance News In a post on its X (formerly Twitter) platform, the market intelligence platform Santiment noted that the second rally for FTT came after the Binance news. The world’s largest crypto exchange and its former CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao had both pleaded to criminal charges and agreed to a settlement of over $4 billion in fines. Related Reading: Grayscale Files Updated Spot ETF As Bitcoin Barrels Past $37,000 As to the correlation between both events, Binance and FTX have always been closely knitted in several regards. For one, CZ, in particular, has sometimes been credited for being responsible for FTX’s collapse. Prior to the bank run on FTX, the former executive had made a tweet about his company liquidating their FTT holdings. As such, it is believed that Binance, going through this difficult phase, comes off as bullish for the FTT token because of the animosity that the FTX and Binance ecosystem share. Interestingly, while FTT has continued to rally, Binance’s BNB has suffered an inverse fate. BNB is down by over 6% in the last seven days, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Sam Bankman-Fried’s Conviction Also Contributed It is worth mentioning that the FTT rally didn’t just kickstart on the back of the Binance news. FTT’s market value is reported to be about 255% up against Bitcoin in the past 3 weeks. This resurgence began just after the 10 largest wallets began accumulating, with $12.8 million worth of FTT bought by these whales since November 3. Interestingly, November 3 happens to be a day after FTX’s former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), was convicted. The FTX founder was convicted of all seven charges leveled against him. Going by this, it would seem that his conviction was conceived as bullish for these whales who decided to double down on their FTT holdings.

42419075,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUDeHd,1700752041,"Singapore Central Bank Rules to Discourage Crypto Speculation, Ease Investment Qualifications","The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has released the second, final tranche of its responses to feedback on a consultation paper of proposed regulations for crypto service providers.  The central bank kept the requirement for crypto entities to discourage cryptocurrency speculation by retail customers by not offering financing, margin transactions or any incentives to trade, it said Thursday. The MAS also wants crypto entities to not accept locally issued credit card payments and to determine a customer's risk awareness before allowing access to the services.  Singapore has been chasing a regulatory balance for crypto while trying to lure the industry. The announcement is part two of responses to feedback received on its proposed regulations for digital payment token (DPT) service providers in Singapore. The first instalment, from July, required providers to deposit customer assets under a statutory trust before year-end for safekeeping.  ""MAS has been very consistent about its stance against speculative retail trading, so it is unsurprising that they are largely moving ahead with their proposals,"" said Angela Ang, a senior policy adviser for blockchain intelligence firm TRM Labs and a former MAS regulator. ""That said, they've landed on slightly less restrictive measures in areas such as the inclusion of cryptocurrencies in determining customers' net worth. This shows that MAS is listening, and is willing to consider industry feedback, even if they do not always agree.""  Among the less restrictive measures, MAS has eased the limits on qualifying as an accredited investor, clarifying that some crypto assets can be counted toward the S$2 million ($1.5 million) needed.  It also appears to have allowed exchanges to come up with their own criteria for listing tokens as long as they disclose conflicts of interest, publish criteria that govern the listing and establish procedures to resolve customer disputes. Hong Kong's approach is more prescriptive, Ang said, allowing only tokens that satisfy the regulator's criteria.  The MAS also has high availability and risk-incidents reporting stipulations. These are in line with current requirements imposed on other systemically important financial institutions, but not payment service providers, making this a special provision for crypto.  The rules will take effect in phases from mid-2024 to provide an ""adequate transitional period"" for their implementation.  The rules are aimed at limiting potential consumer harm, MAS said.  ""While these business conduct and consumer access measures can help meet this objective, they cannot insulate customers from losses associated with the inherently speculative and highly risky nature of cryptocurrency trading,"" said Ho Hern Shin, deputy managing director for financial supervision.

HTX To Resume Services Later Today HTX, one of the world’s leading crypto exchanges, has confirmed the resumptions of its withdrawal and deposit services later today. However, the crypto company should have provided a specific time for the resumption. The crypto exchange said: In addition, HTX (Huobi) is expected to resume deposit and withdrawal services within 24 hours. The specific resumption time will be notified again. Please pay attention to the platform announcement. Related Reading: Huobi (HTX) Troubles Mount: Justin Sun Accused Of $2.4B Shortfall In User Funds The announcement also saw the crypto firm asserting that the recent hack has been “appropriately handled.” This ultimately led to halting the platform’s services to prevent more losses. Furthermore, the crypto exchange has once again asserted its promises to compensate its users for their losses due to the recent hack. The platform stated: Huobi HTX has now properly handled this attack. Huobi HTX once again promises to fully compensate for the losses caused by this attack and 100% guarantee the safety of user funds. The crypto platform stated that the funds lost in the hack were “small” compared to its total funds. The company’s operations are unaffected. The crypto platform stated: The amount of funds lost by Huobi HTX this time accounts for a “very small amount” of the total funds of the platform. The normal operation of Huobi HTX will not be affected by this. Users should rest assured. The Crypto Exchange Fell Victim To Hack On Wednesday, November 22, HTX and blockchain protocol Heco Chain experienced an exploit amassing over $100 million in several assets. The hack was detected by on-chain investigator Cyvers Alerts, alerting the platform of the transactions. According to Cyvers Alert, the total assets lost by HTX were around $23 million, while Heco Chain lost over $85 million. Related Reading: Back-To-Back Breaches: Another Justin Sun Platform Was Hacked, Commits To Covering Losses The platform’s advisor, Justin Sun, later confirmed the hack in a post. The advisor took to X (formerly Twitter) to shed more light on the hack and the company’s intention in handling it. The exploit comes after an October $8 million attack on HTX. The attack resulted in about 500 Ethereum stolen from the exchange. However, in the days that followed the tragedy, all losses were completely compensated. So far, the company has expressed its commitment to preventing such hacks from ever retaking place. Meanwhile, its customers’ well-being will be its highest responsibility.

20592397,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=562080,1700748039,Is Dogecoin About To Reverse? Key Factors To Watch,"These Dogecoin on-chain indicators may be the ones to watch to see if the meme coin has a chance of finding a reversal in the near future or not. Dogecoin Large Holders Have Been Growing, Old Coins Have Come Alive In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has talked about how two on-chain metrics related to Dogecoin have been looking recently. The first indicator of relevance here is the number of DOGE addresses carrying at least 1 million tokens in their balances. At the current exchange rate, this converts to about $75,800, so this range would include the large investors in the market. In particular, the sharks and whales would fall inside this group. These key investors can hold some influence in the market, so their movements can be worth following. Related Reading: Chainlink Retests $14: Here’s What Will Happen If Support Holds The below chart shows how the number of Dogecoin sharks and whales has changed over the last few months: The value of the metric seems to have been climbing in recent days | Source: Santiment on X From the graph, it’s visible that the Dogecoin addresses carrying at least 1 million DOGE have registered some notable growth over the past month. During this period, shark and whale numbers on the network have increased by 121. This would imply there has been interest in the memecoin from the large investors recently. Interestingly, the surge in the number of these addresses has only become sharper since DOGE topped out recently, implying that the sharks and whales have been taking advantage of the lower prices and buying more. This is certainly a positive sign for a reversal in the asset’s price, as the humongous hands appear to be backing the cryptocurrency at the current levels. There has also been a signal that may not necessarily be so positive, however. In the chart, Santiment has also attached the data for another metric, called the “age consumed,” which basically tells us about the movement occurring from the dormant tokens on the blockchain. The dormant coins belong to the “long-term holders” (LTHs), who are the most resolute hands in the sector. When the age consumed metric spikes, it means that these LTHs have decided to finally break their silence. It’s hard to say about the implications of such a trend on the meme coin’s price, but a possibility that’s always on the table is that the LTHs have in fact made their moves to sell the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Has Bitcoin Reached “Euphoria” Yet? What On-Chain Data Says As is apparent from the graph, the Dogecoin age consumed has registered a huge spike recently, implying that HODLers have been on the move. This can be a sign of selling, but Santiment has pointed out that more often than not, such spikes in the indicator signal a change in direction for the asset’s price. Between these two signals, one bullish and the other perhaps a bit more mixed, it now remains to be seen how the price of DOGE develops in the coming days. DOGE Price Since hitting a top above $0.087 a few days back, Dogecoin has slipped down all the way towards $0.076.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Uniswap, a decentralized exchange built on Ethereum, has seen its governance token, UNI, rally over the past 24 hours. UNI climbed over 15%, outperforming the rest of the crypto market. There's no clear reason for the jump, but it could have something to do with the proposal submitted by StableLab (a governance service provider) that seeks to delegate 10 million UNI from the DAO’s treasury to underrepresented delegates. The proposal is awaiting an on-chain vote. Other altcoins also rallied, including collapsed crypto exchange FTX’s FTT token, which gained 10% on the day. Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, added almost 3% and hovered around $37,400. “Technically speaking, dips have been exceptionally well supported and bitcoin looks to be readying for a push to fresh yearly highs and towards a test of next key resistance in the form of the $40k barrier,” said LMAX Digital in a morning note.  The market capitalization of bonk (BONK), a Solana token that came into existence as a meme coin in January, has surged over 1,800% in the past four weeks, outshining Solana's SOL token and industry leader bitcoin (BTC) by a significant margin. The good times, however, might be over. On Wednesday, Binance listed perpetual contracts tied to the token with 50x leverage. Historically, a decision by the exchange to list perpetual contracts tied to smaller tokens has marked major price tops for the relevant cryptocurrencies. Perpetuals are futures contracts with no expiry date, allowing investors to speculate on the price of an underlying asset while bypassing the physical settlement of goods involved in standard futures contracts.  South Korea will start a pilot for a central bank digital currency (CBDC) involving 100,000 citizens in the first quarter of next year, the Korea Times reported. The pilot program will be jointly operated by the Bank of Korea and financial regulators the Financial Services Commission (FSC) and Financial Supervisory Service (FSS), according to the report. The project will see 100,000 people – roughly 0.2% of the country's population – able to purchase goods with tokens issued by commercial banks in the form of CBDC. Use will be restricted to purchasing goods, with other uses such as remittance not permitted.

20589960,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=562067,1700744428,AVAX Holders Beware: $204 Million Token Unlock Could Trigger Price Crash Today,"Token unlocks for cryptocurrencies such as AVAX are not new but that does not negate the kind of impact that these unlocks can have on the price. Depending on the size of the unlock, it could trigger a market crash as millions of new coins roll into circulation and are dumped on retail. This could certainly be the case for AVAX today given the size of the upcoming unlock. AVAX Unlock At $204 Million AVAX’s most recent unlock is about to see a total of 9.5 million tokens being brought into the open market. With the price of the altcoin trending above $21, this puts the total value of the unlock at approximately $204 million. Related Reading: Cardano Forecast: Crypto Analyst Identifies The Event That Could Send ADA Price To $11 According to data from the Token Unlocks website, this unlock will see another 2.68% of the total token supply added to the circulating supply. This will take the percentage of the total supply already unlocked from 55% to 57.68%. This cliff unlock will continue to inflate the AVAX supply, posing a potential roadblock for rallies as the supply increases. Source: Token Unlocks The standard allocation for this cliff unlock is spread across multiple spheres, with the largest portion going to staking rewards. 50% of the total unlocked tokens usually go to these stakes. Then the team portion is 10%, while the foundation gets 9.3%. Implications For Token Price Naturally, an inflation in supply is not good for the token price and this will likely be reflected in the AVAX price soon after. However, taking a look at the last unlock event carrying the same number of coins which took place on August 23, 2023, the chart shows only a small dip in price, suggesting that the unlock event had already been priced in. If this were to repeat, then it’s possible that the AVAX price could maintain its momentum. But the difference between the current trend and that of August is that the token’s price has risen quickly in the last day. This could trigger selling as investors try to take advantage of the price recovery and secure their gains. Related Reading: Ethereum L2 Blast Crosses $123 Million, Important Things To Know Before You Bridge In As data from IntoTheBlock shows, the percentage of AVAX holders that are currently sitting in profit has reached a new 20-month high. A total of 4.02 million holders are sitting in profit, which makes up 66% of the total holder base. The last time that the holder profitability was this high was back in April 2022 when the price was at $94.93. What followed was aggressive profit-taking that would send the price falling more than 70% in a few months. So a repeat of this could see the AVAX price return toward $10.

Since yesterday, Coinbase's reserves have increased by around 12,000 BTC, while Binance's have decreased by 5,000 BTC, the research firm wrote in a recent note.  ""The decrease in Bitcoin reserves on Binance appears to be due to retail outflows,"" Bradley Park, a Web 3 analyst at CryptoQuant wrote to CoinDesk in a note.  ""The market is still nervous about the recent legal implications against Binance,"" Greta Yuan, head of research at Hong Kong-based digital-asset platform VDX said in a note to CoinDesk. ""In the short term, we will see more users move funds to compliant or licensed exchanges for peace of mind.""  ""Coinbase has stood the test of time,"" she said.  Some analysts say that Binance's recent settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice was the last hurdle to getting approval for a spot bitcoin ETF, and that is also affecting fund flows.  ""With this plea deal, the expectations for a spot Bitcoin ETF might have increased to 100% as the industry will be forced to follow the rules that TradFi firms must follow,"" crypto services provider Matrixport wrote.  CryptoQuant identified a 1,000 BTC withdrawal from Coinbase, and Park suggested the transaction was an ""institutional over-the-counter (OTC) trade and can be seen as anticipation of approval of ETFs.""

20586927,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=562087,1700739881,"Evernode Announces Airdrop For XRP Holders, Sets Launch Date","Evernode, a layer-2 network developed on the XRP Ledger (XRPL), has recently provided crucial updates concerning its airdrop for XRP holders. The project, which integrates smart contract capabilities with XRPL, has revised its launch to December 18, 2023, following technical challenges. On the same day, the airdrop is expected to take place. Evernode Launch Date Announced The revised launch date of December 18, 2023, is primarily due to delays with the XUMM wallet’s integration in supporting account cloning on the Xahau network. This network is a recent addition as a sidechain to the XRPL. Situated within this new framework is Evernode, a pioneering project on Xahau. Evernode is the first major project built on Xahau, marking the first major initiative developed using the Hooks feature that Xahau introduces to the broader XRP Ecosystem. Regarding the launch, Evernode stated, “We’re now targeting launch on 18 December 2023… XUMM has been unexpectedly delayed in supporting the cloning of XRPL Accounts on Xahau. We can’t finalize our airdrop until this happens. We believe this will be ready by 18 December, but it is obviously beyond our control and may still change.” Related Reading: Ripple Integration With ISDA Ushers In $1.2 Quadrillion Market, Can XRP Breach $100? Besides that, Evernode informed the community about a notable achievement. The project’s three Hooks have been successfully audited, an important milestone in ensuring the network’s security and functionality. Additionally, the project has established the Xahau address for issuing Evers tokens: rEvernodee8dJLaFsujS6q1EiXvZYmHXr8. For users and airdrop participants, it is crucial to verify this address to avoid scams. Snapshot Details And Eligibility For XRP Holders The airdrop’s eligibility was determined by a snapshot taken on September 1, 2023, at Ledger #82237135. This snapshot recorded the XRP balances on the mainnet at 6:00 PM AEST (8:00 AM UTC). Eligibility for the airdrop includes XRP holders who held up to 50,000 XRP in a non-custodial wallet or used Bitrue or Uphold at the snapshot time. Related Reading: Pro-XRP Lawyer Deaton Picks His Top 10 Cryptos For The Year Ahead Evers tokens will be airdropped into the Xahau account based on XRP holdings in the corresponding XRPL account on the snapshot date. Moreover, the projects’ update further mentioned the commencement of the “formal process” of airdrop preparation on November 27, along with the promise of a tool to assist users in registering and calculating their Evers token allocation based on XRP holdings at the time of the snapshot. The Evers token (EVRS) has a maximum supply of 72,253,440. The airdrop will distribute 20,643,840 Evers among various stakeholders, including 5,160,960 to XRP holders, 5,160,960 to founders, 5,160,960 to beta testers, and 5,160,960 to the Evernode project itself. The remaining 51,609,600 EVRS tokens will be held inside the Evernode Registry Hook. They will be distributed as rewards to hosts in 10 epochs of 5,160,960 Evers over 118 years. Evernode’s launch is anticipated to be a major addition to the XRPL ecosystem. The introduction of a layer-2 network and sidechain could expand development possibilities, leading to more advanced dApps and potentially increasing user engagement with XRPL. At press time, the XRP price has posted a bullish breakout from its downtrend channel in the shorter timeframe, trading at $0.6185.

42419090,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUDeSz,1700738751,Ethereum Layer 2 Blast Has Crypto Users Split on Its Impact,"More than $225 million has been deposited since Monday, despite withdrawals being closed until March.  Users can receive ""Blast points"" for staking assets and referring new users, a reward program some observers say is reminiscent of a pyramid scheme.  Blast is now the seventh-largest holder of staked ether.  Blast, a layer-2 blockchain scheduled to go live in March, has garnered more than $225 million in staked ether [stETH] and stablecoins since Monday despite facing skepticism from many crypto investors.  Described as the first layer-2 network that incorporates native staking, Blast plans to eventually generate yield through ether [ETH] staking and real-world assets (RWAs). Layer 2s are networks built on top of layer-1 blockchains, such as Ethereum, with the aim of making transactions faster and cheaper.  The protocol is headed by the pseudonymous @PacmanBlur, one of the co-founders of the popular NFT marketplace Blur. Part of the network's allure can be attributed to its backers – such as prominent crypto fund Paradigm and ""eGirl Capital,"" a group of crypto-native investors, among others.  The caveat is that staked assets can't be withdrawn until the Blast bridge goes live in February. In the meantime, users receive ""Blast points,"" which can be used to redeem an airdrop scheduled for May. Users can receive additional Blast points by introducing other users through unique referral links. As such, Blast is invite-only as of Thursday, requiring a code from an existing user to gain access.  Thus far, the majority of the $225 million Blast received has been staked on liquid-staking protocol Lido, making Blast the seventh-largest holder of staked ether, according to Etherscan.  But the very nature of restaking on Lido in return for handing out little-known Blast points has attracted criticism from the crypto community.  ""Blast is actually insane,"" one crypto trader wrote on X. ""Use points to attract TVL to a chain that doesn't exist, [convert] the deposited ETH into stETH on a 5-person multisig of anon devs,"" referring to total value locked, or the overall value of assets deposited in the protocol.  Some observers have likened Blast points to a pyramid scheme, with early users standing to gain more points on the number of users they bring in. Technical documents show users get an additional 16% points when their invited users bring in more participants, and another 8% if the second level brings in more people.  There is also discussion over whether the crowded decentralized finance (DeFi) space needs more layer-2 networks. There are currently 232 blockchains in all, according to DeFiLlama, many of which share functions and users. Of those, Ethereum is the largest, commanding 55% of the total value locked, followed by Tron with 17% and BSC with 6%.  Crypto exchanges Coinbase (COIN) and Kraken have recently emerged with their own layer-2 networks in recent months, although it's worth noting that Blast's $225 million total value locked is rapidly approaching that of Coinbase's Base, which has $284 million.  The Blast blockchain not being live for another four months has failed the reduce the appetite of investors, who continue to pour capital into the platform despite the ambiguity of Blast points. Mechanism Capital co-founder Andrew Kang said that Blast has been his ""first new L2 investment since Arbitrum.""  Meanwhile, prices of the closely related Blur (BLUR) token has jumped 18% in the past 24 hours, extending its weekly gain to nearly 40% as some investors consider it a beta bet to Blast.

The pilot program will be operated jointly by the Bank of Korea (BOK) and financial regulators the Financial Services Commission (FSC) and Financial Supervisory Service (FSS), according to a press release on Thursday.  The project will see 100,000 people – roughly 0.2% of the country's population – be able to purchase goods with tokens issued by commercial banks in the form of a CBDC. Use will be restricted to purchasing goods, with other applications, such as remittances, not permitted.  The likely locations for the pilot are Jeju, Busan or Incheon, according to reports in July.  The BOK sees a CBDC as a potential answer to problems with existing government-issued grant systems, such as childcare vouchers or payments during the COVID-19 pandemic. The issues with existing systems include high transaction fees, slow settlement and fraud concerns, the BOK said.  The central banks of the majority of developed economies have been exploring the development of CBDCs in recent years as a means of addressing the decline in the use of cash and the increasing preference by consumers to use digital methods of payment.  China's development of its digital yuan is the most advanced, but South Korea is among the first runners-up, having completed testing functions such as issuing and distributing a CBDC in a simulated environment in December 2021.

The foremost cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, also rebounded on the back of the news as it crossed the $37,000 mark once again. Why Grayscale’s Filing May Be Significant In its filing dated November 22, Grayscale made some amendments to the original S-3, which it had previously filed with the SEC. As pointed out by prominent finance lawyer Scott Johnsson, the changes include some new risk factors. Some of these risk factors are said to match that of ARK Invest’s relating to expanded disclosure of fraud and manipulation risk. Related Reading: Cardano Forecast: Crypto Analyst Identifies The Event That Could Send ADA Price To $11 Johnsson noted that the amended risk factors are important because their inclusion is most likely a directive from the SEC. Meanwhile, fraud and manipulation had served as the grounds why the SEC had disapproved Grayscale’s initial application. Therefore, the lawyer believes that the SEC directing Grayscale to include could mean a “concession” that it is no longer a “roadblock.” As highlighted by Johnsson, Grayscale’s revised filing is significant, especially considering the fact that it has met with the SEC division responsible for approvals right before it. As such, one could assume that it has gotten direction on how to ensure compliance in the hopes that approval could come soon. Meanwhile, it would seem that other potential issuers are also in talks with the SEC. Bloomberg Analyst James Seyffart had recently mentioned hearing rumors of such. If true, that could mean that the SEC is more open to approving these ETFs. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Providing Momentum To Crypto Market Bitcoin rallied past $37,000 on the back of Grayscale’s filing. This price movement signifies the impact that the Spot Bitcoin ETF narrative has on the market. This is also not the first time that news around Spot Bitcoin ETF has provided momentum to the market. In October, Bitcoin touched $30,000 for the first time in months on the back of a false CoinTelegraph post. Although it was false, many instantly realized the impact that an approval of these funds could have on the market. Meanwhile, shortly after that, Bitcoin and the whole crypto market continued to rally on the back of the narrative. Related Reading: Ripple Integration With ISDA Ushers In $1.2 Quadrillion Market, Can XRP Breach $100? During that period, Bitcoin crossed $35,000 on the back of news that BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust had been listed on the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation. BlackRock had also revealed plans to begin seeding during that period. While everyone in the market continues to hold on to speculation, many will hope that the projection of approval by January 10, 2024, comes true. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $37,300, up over 2% in the last 24 hours according to data from CoinMarketCap.

The service will initially be offered to customers in Vienna, where the 97-year-old bank is headquartered, and be provided in association with cryptocurrency exchange Bitpanda, which signed a letter of intent with the bank earlier this year.  “We are starting in Vienna where about a quarter of Austria's population lives,” Curt Chadha, the bank’s head of innovation, said in an interview. “The customer can use their mobile device to enter Bitpanda through the Raiffeisen app. The experience will be familiar, so confirming a trade will work exactly like an account-to-account bank transfer with the same sort of security customers are used to.”  The move by the bank, which has some $215 billion in assets and 17.8 million customers across the European Union and eastern Europe, is another sign of crypto adoption ramping up, particularly in jurisdictions where clarity around rules is emerging.  Chadha said the service is aimed at customers who are digital savvy, but perhaps only want to make a small investment, as opposed to offerings from other banks, which are aimed at wealthy individuals with millions to invest.  Bitpanda, which was founded in Vienna in 2014, is under the supervision of the FMA in Austria and BaFin in Germany, and enables firms to offer regulated trading, investment, and custody services for stocks/ETFs, cryptocurrencies, precious metals, and commodities.

42419094,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUDeX7,1700728642,BONK's Market-Beating Price Surge at Risk as Binance Lists Perpetual Futures Tied to the Token,"On Wednesday, Binance listed perpetual futures tied to the meme token BONK, which has rallied 1,800% in four weeks.  The listing of perpetuals tied to smaller tokens has historically pricked bull runs in the respective cryptocurrencies.  The market capitalization of bonk (BONK), a Solana token that came into existence as a meme coin in January, has surged over 1,800% in the past four weeks, outshining Solana's SOL token and industry leader bitcoin [BTC] by a significant margin.  The good times, however, might be over. On Wednesday, Binance listed perpetual contracts tied to the token with 50x leverage. Historically, a decision by the exchange to list perpetual contracts tied to smaller tokens has marked major price tops for the relevant cryptocurrencies.  Perpetuals are futures contracts with no expiry date, allowing investors to speculate on the price of an underlying asset while bypassing the physical settlement of goods involved in standard futures contracts. They also offer greater leverage than standard contracts.  Here's an example: The market capitalization of Pepe memecoin's (PEPE) surged from nearly zero to $1.5 billion in the weeks leading up to the May 5 listing of PEPE perpetual futures on the exchange. The market value peaked that day, falling to as low as $380 million in the subsequent four weeks, Coingecko shows.  A similar pattern played out in the decentralized lending and borrowing platform Hifi's HIFI token, which more than tripled in the first half of the month and crashed after Binance listed HIFI perpetuals on Sept. 16.  Perhaps the arrival of perpetual futures saw skeptics and bears express their bearish views on the rallying cryptocurrency, pricking the price bubble. Perpetuals allow traders to short or take bearish bets on the cryptocurrency more easily than in the spot market.  BONK may be following a similar course. The token's market cap has already pulled back from $327 million to $257 million in the past 24 hours, Coingecko data show.  ""Now, it isn’t guaranteed to work (nothing is), but if history were our guide, the likelihood of this transpiring is quite high. That said, only time will tell!,"" Priyansh Patel, analyst at Delphi, wrote to clients Wednesday, noting the phenomenon.  Patel added that SOL's rally has been halted after it recently reached $68 and that could be another reason to worry for BONK bulls.  ""Seeing how BONK has pretty much mirrored SOL’s price action, it wouldn’t be unreasonable to assume that this continues and BONK produces some sideways price action if not corrective,"" Patel said.  On Wednesday, Binance also listed perpetuals for Pyth Network's PYTH token, which has rallied 64% this week.",NEGATIVE,BONK,EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB | BONK,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/11/23/bonks-market-beating-price-surge-at-risk-as-binance-lists-perpetual-futures-tied-to-the-token,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3bffc34f85e39c88f929bbe9ddedd68467fc724d-1676x1306.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

20580050,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=562061,1700727050,Dogecoin Dazzle: Netflix Director’s $4 Million Bet Turns Into $27 Million,"In an audacious financial play, Carl Erik Rinsch, the director of Netflix’s sci-fi series “Conquest,” reportedly magnified a $4 million investment in Dogecoin to a whopping $27 million. This unexpected windfall is part of a larger, dramatic narrative involving Rinsch’s handling of the series’ budget. Dogecoin Windfall And Extravagant Expenditure Rinsch’s journey into the crypto realm began after he faced significant losses in the stock market. Financial records show that after receiving an additional $11 million from Netflix to support “Conquest,” Rinsch allocated $10.5 million to stock market ventures, primarily in pharmaceutical companies and the S&P 500. These risky options trades resulted in a loss of nearly $6 million in just a few weeks, leaving him with a little over $4 million. Related Reading: Dogecoin Jumps 10%, But This Signal Could Bring Rally To A Stop In a bold pivot, Rinsch transferred the remaining funds to the cryptocurrency exchange Kraken, where he invested heavily in Dogecoin, a then-emerging digital currency inspired by an internet meme. His investment coincided with an extraordinary surge in Dogecoin’s value, culminating in him cashing out around $27 million in May 2021, as evidenced by an account statement seen by the Times. Following this success, Rinsch reportedly expressed his gratitude in an online chat with a Kraken representative, saying, “Thank you and god bless crypto.” However, Rinsch’s windfall quickly translated into extravagant spending. He embarked on a lavish spree, purchasing five Rolls-Royces, a Ferrari, a high-priced Vacheron Constantin watch valued at $387,630, and an assortment of luxury furniture and designer clothing. The total expenditure amounted to $8.7 million, as determined by a forensic accountant hired by Ms. Rosés, Rinsch’s then-wife. Related Reading: Dogecoin Metrics Signal Impending Breakout, How High Can The Price Go? The spending raised suspicions during Rinsch’s acrimonious divorce from Ms. Rosés. Her legal team speculated that these purchases might be an attempt to conceal his cryptocurrency profits. In response, Rinsch claimed in a deposition that these items were props for “Conquest,” funded by Netflix’s production money. “Conquest” Is Written Off Remarkably, Rinsch’s financial upswing stands in sharp contrast to the fate of “Conquest.” Netflix, having invested over $55 million in the series, has yet to receive a single completed episode. Rinsch’s unconventional financial maneuvers and erratic behavior during the production have led to a standoff with Netflix. The streaming giant is now embroiled in a confidential arbitration process with Rinsch, who claims a breach of contract and seeks at least $14 million in damages. Netflix, contesting these claims, views Rinsch’s demands as unfounded. Thomas Cherian, a spokesman for Netflix, highlighted the company’s extensive support for Rinsch’s series, noting the eventual decision to write off the project due to the realization that Rinsch was not on track to complete it.

The upcoming Bitcoin halving event on April 19, 2024, is expected to drive upward momentum in Bitcoin prices. The application of Elliott Wave Theory suggests a bullish trajectory for Bitcoin's future based on price patterns.

Click here to find out more » Introduction Since earlier this year, after experiencing a significant period of market drought, crypto markets have begun to rebound, again presenting renewed opportunities for promising investments. In particular, the recent shift in sentiment has resulted in the asset class leader Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) to surge more than 100%. Investment Thesis My investment thesis on Bitcoin revolves around the current wave of new-found euphoria in the overall market, the upcoming ""halving"" date on the horizon, and some discernible favorable patterns derived from a thorough examination and in-depth technical analysis of Bitcoin's price charts. These factors serve as robust indicators, leading me to anticipate, with confidence, that Bitcoin is likely to finally surpass its $100k milestone as Indicators point to a bullish trajectory persisting into 2025. Upcoming Halving The upcoming Bitcoin halving, after current calculations about to take place on April 19, 2024 , marks another pivotal moment for Bitcoin. This process involves a reduction in the reward that miners receive for validating transactions, essentially halving the rate at which new Bitcoins are created. Historically , these halving events have played a crucial role in driving upward momentum in Bitcoin prices. The scarcity introduced by the halving tends to fuel investor optimism, creating a bullish environment as demand outpaces the reduced supply. As illustrated in the accompanying graphic, past halvings have consistently correlated with significant price rallies, reinforcing the notion that this event holds substantial importance for Bitcoin's trajectory and market dynamics. Bitcoin Halving Overview (Investing.com) Elliott Waves One of the most popular tools for analyzing the price movements of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is the Elliott Wave Theory . This theory, developed by Ralph Nelson Elliott in the 1930s, proposes that market cycles are driven by the collective psychology of investors, which manifests in waves of optimism and pessimism. According to the theory, there are five main waves in a trend, followed by three corrective waves in the opposite direction. The aim of using Elliott Waves is to identify the start and end of each wave, as well as the potential reversal points, and to anticipate the future price action based on the wave patterns. In the following, I used this exact technique to derive future price implications for Bitcoin. So now, let's apply this methodology to some Bitcoin price charts that I prepared. BTC: Multi-Year-Chart (TradingView & Author) This first multi-year chart shows the completion of the first wave, labeled with a magenta 1. The internal structure of this wave consists of five green subwaves, confirming its impulsive nature. The second wave follows as a flat correction, with an A-B-C internal structure. The B wave makes a new high, overshooting the previous peak. The C wave ends at the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level, matching the low of Wave 2. This marks the end of the correction and the start of a new impulsive wave. The third wave, which is still in progress, began in November 2022 and has been very strong and persistent. It is also impulsive, as shown by the five green subwaves. The minimum target for this wave is $150,000, which is the 161.8% Fibonacci extension of Wave 1. This is a typical projection for the third wave and represents the lowest possible scenario. However, given the tendency of cryptocurrencies to extend their waves, especially in bullish markets, Bitcoin could reach much higher levels than that. BTC: Internal Structure, 3rd Wave (TradingView & Author) This second chart, representing the internal structure of the third wave we just ended with, shows a series of 1-2 patterns that have all been completed, indicating that we are now in the final stage of the 3rd wave (Turquoise). The internal structure of the Turquoise wave signals that it is close to finishing the dark blue Wave 5. After the Turquoise Wave 3 ends, we expect a Turquoise Wave 4 to follow, which could offer a good entry point for folks to load up on even more coins. In short, we are in the extended 3 of the magenta three from the previous chart, and this third wave is usually the most powerful wave with few retracements. Internal Structure of the Turquoise 3 (TradingView & Author) This final chart shows the internal structure of the turquoise 3 wave, which is part of a larger impulse wave. The dark blue wave has completed its five subwaves at about 38k, followed by a corrective wave that has reached the target zone marked by the dark blue box. The current wave is expected to be the longest and strongest of the impulse, and it has already surpassed the previous high of wave (i). However, there is still some resistance at this level, and a pullback into the target zone is possible before the wave resumes its upward momentum. Again, this could offer a favorable entry point for buyers who anticipate higher prices in wave (iv) and (v). Risks To My Thesis While my investment thesis presents a bullish outlook for Bitcoin based on the upcoming halving event and Elliott Wave analysis, it's essential to acknowledge potential risks that could impact the trajectory I've outlined. Cryptocurrency markets are inherently volatile, and external factors can swiftly alter the landscape. Furthermore, the cryptocurrency market is heavily influenced by investor sentiment, which can change rapidly. Also, unforeseen geopolitical events, regulatory developments, or macroeconomic shifts could lead to a sudden change in sentiment, impacting Bitcoin's price trajectory. The evolving nature of blockchain technology and regulatory environments can significantly impact the cryptocurrency market. Changes in government regulations or advancements in competing technologies, even if regarded as unlikely, may introduce uncertainties that could affect the anticipated bullish trend. Other external factors: Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have shown a surprising correlation with broader markets in terms of reacting to macroeconomic factors, especially inflation and interest rate-related topics. Unfavorable changes in these variables could also cause a sentiment shift, leading to unforeseeable price movements in Bitcoin's price Conclusion Ultimately, the confluence of factors supporting my bullish investment thesis for Bitcoin paints a compelling picture for the cryptocurrency's future trajectory. The upcoming halving event stands as a key catalyst. Additionally, the application of Elliott Wave Theory further strengthens the thesis. Nevertheless, the positive indicators from the halving event, sentiment shift, and Elliott Wave analysis underscore my optimistic outlook for Bitcoin's future. This analysis exclusively serves as an informational piece. While I present a positive outlook based on my perspective, it's crucial to consider this information alongside other factors and individual risk tolerance when making informed investment decisions.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4653851-bitcoin-recent-crypto-euphoria-likely-to-propel-bitcoin-north-100k?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/20579490.jpeg

20577780,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=562045,1700723047,Cardano Phoenix Moment: Price Breakout In The Face Of Recent Setbacks,"In the midst of recent market fluctuations, Cardano (ADA) has attracted significant attention from both investors and analysts alike. The cryptocurrency had a drop in value over the weekend, but it still managed to record strong gains—it has increased by about 50% in the last month. This noteworthy performance has fueled heightened interest and speculation surrounding ADA’s potential for a substantial bullish rally in the foreseeable future. Of particular focus for analysts are the critical resistance levels that ADA has consistently struggled to breach throughout the year. Cardano Current Trading Price And Momentum At the time of writing, ADA was trading at $0.38, up 3.7% in the last seven days, data from crypto market price aggregator Coingecko shows. Even in the face of these challenges, ADA’s resilience and positive momentum have sparked discussions about the coin’s capacity to defy market uncertainties and pave the way for notable upward movements. Related Reading: Binance Drama Causes Crypto Prices To Dance On The Edge – Details The native cryptocurrency of the Cardano has garnered significant attention in recent times as a result of its notable surge in price. On November 16, the asset’s value exceeded $0.40, marking the first occurrence since April 2023. Meanwhile, in the wake of recent developments in Cardano’s staking landscape, there has been a noticeable uptick in rewards distributed to participants in the network’s staking programs. This surge in rewards coincides with a proactive stance taken by bullish Cardano network participants, spurred by positive shifts in staking dynamics throughout the week. In October 2023, Cardano experienced a substantial surge in staking activities, reaching a 90-day peak of 23.05 billion ADA coins staked on October 23. At that time, with ADA trading at approximately $0.27, the cumulative staking valuation soared to $6.2 billion. Total crypto market cap is currently at $1.38 trillion. Chart: TradingView.com At the time of writing, data from StakingRewards.com, a staking data aggregator platform, indicates that a total of 22.94 billion ADA coins are currently staked across diverse staking protocols, underscoring the ongoing vibrancy in Cardano’s staking ecosystem. Certain analysts posit that this event may signify the initiation of a substantial rally, perhaps propelling the asset to a new record peak in the foreseeable future. In light of the current volatility, analyst and cryptocurrency YouTuber LuckSide Crypto admitted that ADA’s price performance has fallen behind that of other significant cryptocurrencies. Nevertheless, he gave investors confidence that ADA will soon see big returns. On-Chain Data And Cardano’s Upcoming Gains LuckSide called attention to ADA’s ongoing efforts to break through the 40–41 cent area, which has proven to be a difficult barrier that it has faced all year long due to downward pressure. Another analyst – the founder of Crypto Capital Venture, Dan Gambardello – suggested that ADA might be in a pre-bull run state right now and predicted that the coin’s price will soar months after the BTC halving, which is slated to take place in the spring of next year. In particular, Gambardello forecast that in 2025, the token’s market value may soar to $400 billion, while ADA might reach an all-time high of roughly $11.

42419078,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUDeLl,1700719591,Bitcoin Supply Inactive for a Year Hits Record High of 70%,"The percentage of Bitcoin's [BTC] circulating supply that was last active on-chain at least a year ago has reached a record high of 70.35%, surpassing the previous peak of 69.35% in July, according to data tracked by blockchain analytics firm Glassnode.  The new lifetime high reflects ""a strong belief from bitcoin's holder base in the wake of crypto-wide contagion and macro headwinds after its all-time highs in 2021,"" according to Reflexivity Research.  The percentage of supply that has not moved on-chain in two, three, and five years is also at their respective lifetime highs. It shows long-term investors are in no mood to sell even after bitcoin has more than doubled to $37,000 this year.  ""While higher prices will ultimately incentivize new sellers, with Bitcoin up over 100% in the same time period, it appears Bitcoin holders are not planning on offloading inventory at these price levels or any time soon,"" Reflexivity Research said in a note to clients.  These metrics, however, may not paint an accurate picture once the financialization of bitcoin through alternative investment vehicles like spot-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and cash-settled futures gathers pace.  For instance, in the ETF case, an issuer, with the help of the authorized participant, will pool the cryptocurrency and move it to custody, where it sits idle (inactive).

Zhao pleaded guilty and resigned from the crypto exchange he founded on Tuesday, alongside Binance pleading guilty to multiple criminal and civil charges tied to its allowing U.S. users and users from sanctioned regions to use the platform without adequate know-your-customer and anti-money laundering programs. Binance agreed to pay $4.3 billion in penalties, among the largest corporate fines in the history of the U.S. Department of Justice.  In Wednesday's filing, prosecutors said Zhao, as a citizen of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), had ""minimal ties to the U.S."" and may not return should he be allowed to leave. They noted that they were not asking for him to be jailed ahead of sentencing – only that he be required to remain in the U.S. His sentencing is currently scheduled for Feb. 23, 2024, and he faces potentially over a year in prison, along with a fine.  Read more: Binance to Pay $4.3B to Settle U.S. Criminal Case; Changpeng 'CZ' Zhao Resigns as CEO and Pleads Guilty in Seattle  Under the terms of his current bond agreement, Zhao can leave the U.S., having put up $15 million in a trust account, signed a $175 million personal recognizance bond and found guarantors putting up additional funds.  This is insufficient, prosecutors said in Wednesday's filing. If Zhao did not return to the U.S., they wouldn't be able to secure the $175 million bond as most of his assets are outside the country, and Zhao is wealthy enough that he could pay off the rest of the funds without an issue, they said. There also isn't an extradition treaty between the UAE and the U.S.  During a hearing on Tuesday, Zhao's attorneys argued that forcing him to stay in the U.S. prior to sentencing would be a hardship for him and his family. His wife and children cannot relocate to the U.S. during the several-month period between Tuesday's hearing and February's sentencing.  Magistrate Judge Brian Tsuchida asked prosecutors on Tuesday whether that Zhao voluntarily came to the U.S. to surrender and plead guilty meant there wasn't any serious risk of flight.  There's a difference between voluntarily coming to the U.S. to plead guilty and doing so to face potential prison time, a prosecutor said in response.  Zhao is currently in the U.S. until at least Nov. 27. If District Judge Richard Jones chooses not to review the DOJ filing by 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time on that day, Zhao will be free to return to the UAE, but must come back to the U.S. by Feb. 10.",NEGATIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | FIAT | BNB,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/11/23/binances-ex-ceo-cz-poses-a-serious-risk-of-flight-prosecutors-claim-in-asking-he-stay-in-us,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dd05dc1130c8ad2f74b461577af9998960adc810-2043x1149.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

20569721,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=562026,1700708451,"Synthetix (SNX) Shines As TVL Hits $670M, Analyst Predicts Continued Upswing","Synthetix (SNX), currently positioned as the 54th largest cryptocurrency, has been closely aligned with the overall market trend. Over the past 30 days, SNX has experienced a substantial uptrend of 60%, while its year-to-date performance shows an impressive price increase of over 108%. These notable achievements indicate the potential for continued bullish momentum for the decentralized protocol and its native token. Significant Growth For Synthetix As Demand For On-Chain Derivatives Surges Renowned cryptocurrency analyst and writer, Jake Pahor, has expressed a highly optimistic outlook on SNX, hailing it as the ultimate “picks & shovels play” in anticipation of the forthcoming bull market. Pahor highlights Synthetix’s pivotal role as the backbone for derivatives trading in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. The protocol has already amassed an annualized revenue of $54 million, serving as a platform that enables the creation and trading of synthetic assets such as commodities, stocks, and currencies. While Synthetix may not have user-facing front-ends, it powers popular DeFi applications like Kwenta, Polynomial, dHedge, and Lyra. As the demand for permissionless trading of spot synthetics and on-chain derivatives of traditional assets continues to rise, Synthetix stands poised for significant growth in the coming years, according to Pahor. Related Reading: Cardano Forecast: Crypto Analyst Identifies The Event That Could Send ADA Price To $11 Notably, a key driver of Synthetix’s success lies in the fees generated on every synthetic asset exchange, ranging from 0.1% to 1% (average 0.3%). These fees are directed towards SNX stakers, creating a rewarding incentive structure. SNX, sUSD, and eSNX are the three primary tokens utilized within the Synthetix ecosystem, each serving distinct purposes in staking, collateralization, and protocol functionality. With a circulating supply of 326.5 million SNX tokens and a total supply of 327.2 million, Synthetix boasts a market cap of $1.14 billion, placing it at the forefront of the Synthetics category. The protocol’s treasury holds a healthy $145.96 million, including stablecoins, BTC/ETH, and its token SNX. SNX Bulls Poised For Breakout Opportunity Synthetix operates under the governance of four key bodies: Spartan Council, Treasury Council, Ambassador Council, and Grants Council. These councils’ Decisions and proposals are subject to majority votes from SNX stakers, ensuring a democratic and community-driven approach to protocol development. It was established as Havven in 2017, a stablecoin protocol, the project rebranded in 2018 to become Synthetix, focusing on synthetic assets and derivatives trading. According to Pahor’s analysis, with a “strong ecosystem” of projects built on its infrastructure and a first-mover advantage, Synthetix has established itself as the market leader in the Synthetics category. Related Reading: Celestia Loses Momentum: Anticipating A Rebound Post 11% Dip Furthermore, the impending release of Synthetix V3, including Perps, Base, and USDC, is expected to be a significant catalyst for the protocol. Additionally, the protocol’s DEX perps feature aims to compete with centralized exchanges, while the Infinex front-end promises a user experience akin to traditional CEX trading. Currently, SNX is trading at $3.455, reflecting a significant 4.7% uptrend over the past 24 hours. This positive momentum follows a 31% gain over the last fourteen days. In the immediate future, SNX faces a crucial hurdle in surpassing the resistance level at $3.58, which is necessary to retest its recently achieved yearly high of $3.810. As SNX reached this high only a few hours ago, its next target is to surpass the $4 mark, a level not seen since August 2022. On the other hand, if a short-term pullback or correction unfolds for SNX, it will be crucial for bullish investors to defend the $3.035 support level. Maintaining this level can sustain a favorable bullish trend throughout the remainder of the month.

The surge in AVAX burning on the C-Chain is primarily due to the launch of inscriptions, which permit storing data on the Avalanche’s C-Chain, pushing the number of AVAX being taken out of circulation. Avalanche Burning AVAX At Record Pace @kevinsekniqi estimates that if the burn rate is maintained at spot rates, it could see approximately $400 million of the coin taken away from circulation. This could be a significant figure supporting AVAX bulls long-term since reducing supply at constant demand would naturally lead to price gains. Related Reading: Panic At Binance Following CZ’s Departure? Analyzing 24-Hour Inflow and Outflow Trends The heightened activity in recent days stems from the over 2.3 million daily transactions tied to users creating and transferring “ASC-20” tokens to inscribe data permanently onto Avalanche’s C-Chain. On average, the Avalanche C-Chain processes around 450,000 transactions daily. However, this figure has been changing in recent days, reading from on-chain data. On-chain activity is up roughly 4X due to inscriptions, driving the network’s revenue as gauged by gas fees collected. Through inscriptions, new use cases, as demonstrated in Bitcoin, around provable ownership and identity have emerged. Since Avalanche is a public ledger maintained by distributed validators operating nodes, gas fees must be paid. Part of the gas is burnt as part of Avalanche’s structure. FTX Group Selling AVAX, Bulls Dominant It is not immediately clear how the spike in the number of inscriptions on the C-Chain will impact prices. Though more inscriptions could support bulls, other external market factors should be considered. Related Reading: Shibarium Transactions Spike 288%, But Why Is Shiba Inu Price Down Today? According to Scopescan data, FTX Group, a team tasked with managing FTX estate, recently sent 916,780 AVAX worth $20.7 million to Binance. Transfers to centralized exchanges are often interpreted as bearish. Following this, AVAX prices fell by 13% on November 21. Prices remain stable, and AVAX maintains an uptrend despite prices contracting this week. Looking at the developments in the daily chart, the coin roared 190% from October 2023 lows. It peaked at around $16 in November. At present, prices have cooled off, dropping by approximately 18%. Nonetheless, the uptrend remains. Any break above $16 could spur more activity, even lifting the coin towards August 2022 highs of around $30.

Porter’s remarks amidst growing anticipation surrounding the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the highly anticipated halving event scheduled for April 2024. According to Porter, these events, combined with the efforts of the Satoshi Action Fund, have the potential to impact the price and adoption of Bitcoin significantly. Satoshi’s Plan To Establish The US As Global Bitcoin Leader Satoshi Action Fund, a non-profit organization dedicated to informing policymakers and regulators about Bitcoin, has actively shifted the narrative surrounding the world’s leading cryptocurrency. The fund aims to promote “hyper-Bitcoinization,” a term coined to describe the widespread adoption of Bitcoin as a global currency. One of the primary goals of the Satoshi Action Fund is to advocate for the passage of pro-Bitcoin legislation in 10 different US states by 2024. According to Porter, these proposed laws would protect individuals’ rights to self-hold and mine Bitcoin, positioning the United States as a global leader in Bitcoin adoption and mining. Related Reading: Panic At Binance Following CZ’s Departure? Analyzing 24-Hour Inflow and Outflow Trends Interestingly, Porter envisions a future where bipartisan legislation empowers Bitcoin and fosters the growth of an emerging digital asset industry. Recent developments in the Bitcoin ecosystem further bolster Porter’s optimism. The halving event occurs approximately every four years and is anticipated to reduce the rate at which new Bitcoins are created, potentially leading to increased scarcity and upward price pressure. Additionally, the long-awaited approval of Bitcoin ETFs by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has the potential to attract institutional investors and facilitate mainstream adoption. BTC’s Path To New Heights Renowned crypto expert Charles Edwards has boldly proclaimed that the recent liquidation of fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) surrounding the crypto market will pave the way for a significant price rebound. Edwards believes that the culmination of recent developments, particularly the Binance news, will eliminate sources of FUD accumulated over the past two years. The market has been gripped by panic triggered by headlines associating the term “guilty” with cryptocurrencies. However, Edwards suggests that the recent news concerning Binance should be viewed more as a settlement rather than a detrimental event. Edwards points out that five years ago, exchanges were not compliant with know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) regulations, whereas now, they have implemented these practices. Consequently, Edwards believes that the lingering FUD surrounding Binance can finally be restored. Looking ahead, Edwards highlights several positive catalysts on the horizon for BTC. These include the potential approval of ETFs, the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, expectations of lower interest rates, and the possibility of a recession leading to increased quantitative easing (QE). Related Reading: Binance New CEO Affirms Strength In Company’s Fundamentals Edwards concludes by envisioning a “Bitcoin liquidity atomic bomb” waiting to explode. With the elimination of FUD and a series of positive triggers aligning, the market is poised for a substantial rebound. The convergence of ETF approvals, the halving event, accommodative monetary policies, and a potential recession are expected to propel Bitcoin to new heights. At the time of writing, Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $36,500, experiencing a slight decline of 2.2% over the past 24 hours.

20564089,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=562002,1700697652,BNB Price Crash To $5 Unlikely Despite Binance Critic’s Dire Predictions,"A Binance critic, “Whale Wire,” on X, who also claims to be a crypto whale, has issued a bold prediction that BNB, the native currency of the BNB Chain and which is used to incentivize trading activity on Binance, could plunge 95% to under $5 in the coming months. Regarding Binance agreeing to pay $4 billion in fines related to legal settlements with U.S. regulators, Whale Wire argued that tighter oversight will supposedly “destroy Binance’s entire business model.” He further contended bankruptcy could be imminent as the effects of the BNB lead to a contagion. Will The BNB Price Flash Crash? However, while increasing regulatory oversight, wind-downs, and decreased risk tolerance among traders have impacted volumes, Binance remains the world’s largest crypto exchange by client count and still facilitates the most trading globally by a wide margin as of writing on November 22. Related Reading: Has Bitcoin Reached “Euphoria” Yet? What On-Chain Data Says For context and pulling data from CoinMarketCap (CMC), Binance continues to dominate spot crypto trading, generating over $14.7 billion in average trading volume, over 6X Coinbase, with $2.3 billion, and ahead by huge margins from Kraken, which draws 41.2 billion. The same trend can be observed in derivatives trading, where Binance leads ahead of OKX. BNB also remains firmly among the top 5 cryptos in the market cap. Besides USDT, BNB is the third largest coin by market cap, leading other altcoins, including XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA). Related Reading: Ripple Integration With ISDA Ushers In $1.2 Quadrillion Market, Can XRP Breach $100? Besides its dominance, Binance has been given over a year to pay assessed fines. Meanwhile, its new CEO, Richard Teng, said the exchange will continue to enact compliance overhauls. At the same time, it is assuring clients that funds remain safe. Considering the exchange will continue operating both in the United States and globally, the transitional window offered by the DOJ could make its collapse, and that of BNB, unlikely. Binance Under Pressure, Trading Volume Falling Even so, factoring in dropping trading volume in 2023 and the impact of losing users, especially in areas Binance pulled out from, the resulting dip in revenue could, at the end of the day, apply downward pressures on BNB. Thus far, Binance sold its business in Russia while exiting Canada and the Netherlands. Presently, $200 remains a critical support level for BNB. Whether this line will be retested in the months ahead remains to be seen. Changing hands at around $230, BNB is technically in an uptrend in the shorter time frame. It is up 15% from October 2023 lows. However, it is still down 65% from 2021 peaks when it soared to around $670.
