42378406,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7i8zR,1448645409,Is Bitcoin Volatility All In The Mind?,"Bitcoin in the Headlines is a weekly analysis of industry media coverage and its impact.  The good news is that bitcoin's association with terrorism and Daesh played a somewhat smaller part in this week's coverage.  Although some of the narrative spilled over from last week, and the news did travel far and wide, most mainstream outlets seemed to focus on the digital currency's price in light of the Black Friday shopping event.  More interestingly, however, was Motherboard's piece which united the digital currency and the human brain to ascertain the impact of its volatility on individuals.  Who said what and where? CoinDesk has rounded up the top bitcoin and blockchain-related headlines from across the world.  Bitcoin and neuroscience  The award – if there ever was any – for the week's most creative reporting goes to Motherboard. Reporter Jordan Pearson spoke to a neuroscientist in a quest to find out how the digital currency's volatility impacted the human brain.  ""The price of bitcoin is a fickle thing,"" Pearson writes, adding:  ""Two years ago this week, bitcoin reached its highest price ever: $1,242 for a single coin in US dollars, up from $12 at the beginning of 2013. Almost immediately after that peak, the price began to sink, and today the virtual currency still hasn't regained its former glory. The price of a bitcoin simply continues to bob up and down, from around $200 to just above $400 this year alone.""  Every value decrease, the piece adds, elicits a ""state of emergency"" from some members of the bitcoin community and the slightest increase in value, has people ""losing their ever-loving shit.""  Despite its volatility, however, the piece points out that there seems to be no explanation for its changing price. Could it have something to do with Chinese ponzi schemes, investor-driven speculation or international market manipulation? Perhaps, the reporter adds, bitcoin is the future after all, adding:  ""The answer, it turns out, could be in our heads, because for every change in Bitcoin price, there are neurons that light up like a Christmas tree in response.""  Now, the real interesting stuff begins. Researchers have, the article notes, conducted a vast amount of work into analysing the effects of changes in the stock market on the human brain, and vice versa.  ""The stock market's behaviour is ultimately the result of the collective decision-making of many people, after all (less so today now that high-frequency trading algorithms are popular), and decisions are physiological things; they happen in the brain. And just like the price of a stock, bitcoin price is largely a function of the decisions people make.""  'It's all in the brain'  Dr Gregory Berns, a neuroeconomist and director of the Center of Neuropolicy and Emory Unviversity, told Motherboard:  ""It's all in the brain, and looking at specific regions that we know are carrying information about risk and reward is kind of like eavesdropping ... If one area seems to be the one that collects all the information from other brain systems, if you will, and integrates it, then it represents an overall barometer for that person at that point in time as to what their expectation is. So, we can listen to that and tease out what they're likely to do next.""  Berns said that information and expectation are both key elements to consider when teasing out how firing neurons direct the market.  ""Information guides your expectations, and depending on what your expectation is – whether bitcoin is about to skyrocket or crash, say – a region in the brain called the striatum will react differently. The striatum associated with decision-making, and has the densest collection of dopamine receptors in the brain,"" he said.  Neuroscience, the author notes, may help to explain some of bitcoin's volatility but the digital currency only has a relatively small community of users, in comparison to the real-world stock markets.  Berns added:  “The smaller the market, and anything with a greater role for human decision-making, is where you’d see greater benefit for understanding the physiology. With bitcoin, information is more scarce, in that each little bit of information that comes out has a potentially big effect on people's valuation of that thing ... because of its history, and its past swings, people gravitate toward and grab onto any information they can, true or not.""  He continued: ""With every bit of news about new investors in bitcoin, or perhaps the latest potential market scam or hack, the striatum of a bitcoin trader lights up with activity, and if they're expecting something positive, dopamine is release. En masse, this big dopamine rush can look like a price rally.""  Again, Berns explained that expectation is key. Positive or negative information, he added, can have paradoxical effects on an individual's brain, noting:""If something ostensibly bad happens in bitcoin – the bottom falls out of the price, for example – then someone's brain may actually respond as if that were a positive thing.""  ""It's illogical,"" he continued. ""But then again people aren't exactly logical when it comes to money.""  ""Or Bitcoin,"" closes Pearson.  Bitcoin Black Friday  The digital currency's price also made a cameo appearance this week in light of Bitcoin Black Friday, a day of discounted online shopping for bitcoin paying customers.  Writing for Inverse, Peter Rugg questioned whether the event could serve to throw the digital currency into the mainstream, whilst also impacting on its value.  He wrote: ""Bitcoin Black Friday: The fourth-annual event is projected to include more than 150 participating stores, and if history is any indication could affect the price of the digital currency.""  Historically, Rugg continued, the event has caused a spike in the cryptocurrency's value:  ""About this time in 2014, bitcoin prices were roughly at $350 before going to $380 on Bitcoin Black Friday, a jump that also happened the year before. One reason for this could be the media hyping the upcoming event and getting bitcoin into the mind of consumers, but another might be that people who spent bitcoin on Black Friday deals tended to buy the coins right back, potentially driving up the price.""  At the time of writing, bitcoin's price looked relatively stable, hovering at around the $360 mark, although it did surge by 12% yesterday, hitting a weekly high.

42378415,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7i98F,1448640020,Lloyd's Sees Blockchain's Potential For Insurance Markets,"A plan to modernise the London Market – the major international insurance market based in the United Kingdom's capital – may include recommendations to use blockchain technology to improve data access and reduce costs associated with administrative paperwork.  Lloyd's  , one of the London Market's key participants, held a seminar in London last week to highlight blockchains, among other technologies, to insurance market participants as part of their modernisation plan, called the Target Operating Modelhttp://www.londonmarketgroup.co.uk/index.php/current-resources/tom, or TOM.  Blockchains could bring increased risk-recording abilities, transparency, accuracy and speed to the insurance markets, Lloyd's director of operations, Shirine Khoury-Haq told CoinDesk in a statement.  Khoury-Haq elaborated on the insurance market's interest in blockchains:  ""Blockchain has the potential to improve the way insurers record risk, increasing the speed, accuracy and transparency of our processes. As part of the TOM consultation we will be interested to see how blockchain could help us resolve some of the challenges facing our industry.”  The two blockchain use-cases floated at the seminar were for blockchain-powered digital 'deal rooms', where documents can be securely shared and logged, and a new token on a permissioned ledger for insurance markets. The ideas were presented by Michael Mainelli, an emeritus professor at Gresham College and executive chairman of Z/Yen, a think-tank and venture capital firm.  Blockchain-powered deal-rooms  Mainelli said online digital deal-rooms could significantly change the way business is currently done in the London Market. While such technology already exists, few market participants make use of it.  Instead, they rely on physical proximity to one another, personal relationships and paper documents to get deals done, he said.  ""Everyone [in the market] works within three minutes of Lloyds, but they also know they're dirt if they renege on a contract. Within hours everyone will freeze them out,"" Mainelli added.  But an online deal-room using a blockchain could make the London Market more attractive to international business, which could drive significant growth for Lloyd's and the London Market, he pointed out.  ""If we were sitting in Hong Kong right now and decided to create a global insurance market, we could build a quick deal-room and we would automate it from the start,"" added Mainelli.  A blockchain-based deal-room would strip out the need to trust an intermediary while providing an accurate record of the documents shared by the deal's participants.  ""It gives you a database that's unalterable and nobody owns. It's a ledger of who sent what to whom, when, forever. That's an important part [of the insurance process],"" Mainelli said.  Moving away from paper  The other technologies presented at the Lloyd's seminar included peer-to-peer lending and alternative cross-border payments. The seminar's goal was to debate the ""risks and rewards of technological disruption"" with a view to implementing some of those ideas in the modernisation plan.  The TOM is a five-year plan to ""support the ease of doing business"" in the London Market. It kicked off this year with a goal to develop a roadmap for the initiative. Next year, a governance structure will be set up to implement the recommendations over the next three years.  The end-result of TOM would be a ""one touch, unified and intelligent"" approach for the London Markets with a strong emphasis on updating the technologies in use by market participants.  The plan is driven by the London Market Group, an industry advocacy organisation that counts the market's major participants among its members.  Although the LMG's modernisation plans are both ambitious and laudable, Mainelli cautions against putting too much stock in an outcome that will move the insurance markets away from its favoured technology: paper.  ""They always have these reform programmes. None of these have ever bitten. The quickest way to see that is to walk through Leadenhall Market and see all these guys carrying stacks of paper around,"" he concluded.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | WALLET,Joon Ian Wong,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/11/27/lloyds-sees-blockchains-potential-for-insurance-markets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cca0d0a529686e7c0bb240f4e6e9bc381962bd71-1600x774.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42378416,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7i96z,1448625631,"Citi, Nordea Select Bitcoin Compliance Firm for Accelerators","As global financial institutions become more interested in bitcoin and blockchain technology, some are beginning to invest and work with startups they believe will empower them with the tools to one day engage with the industry.  Today, this means partnerships like that between UK banking giant Barclays and bitcoin compliance startup Chainalysis. The two companies announced in October that Barclays would work with Chainalysis, a graduate of its New York-based FinTech accelerator, to allow its financial crimes division to better understand the technology.  Now, there are signs that this partnership may be the start of a larger strategy that could be embraced by major banks. For example, Israel-based bitcoin compliance startup Polycoin was recently accepted into two incubators, one backed by financial services giant Citi and the other by Nordic banking conglomerate Nordea.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Polycoin CEO Alfred Shaffir indicated that he believes partnerships with compliance startups will be a necessary first step for any bank seeking to become more active in their work with the technology.  Shaffir told CoinDesk:  “We feel that the moment [banks] start working with the blockchain, they will need a compliance tool.”  Polycoin touts a full solution for blockchain compliance, with Shaffir noting that the firm wants to become the NICE Actimize for bitcoin, a nod to the digital financial crime prevention tool founded in the late 1990s.  The startup was selected to be one of 10 participants in the Nordea accelerator this October, and was chosen out of 170 applicants. The company is also simultaneously participating in the Citi innovation accelerator, its fourth in Israel.  Timely pivot  Originally founded as a bitcoin payment processing startup in 2014, Polycoin pivoted this summer amidst the overall downturn in consumer bitcoin spending.  “Bitcoin impacted our decision. We understand that there was a huge problem creating an economy around bitcoin,” Shaffir said.  However, Shaffir was able to identify a potential use case for part of its existing payment processing product. In addition to a merchant tool similar to those offered by BitPay and Coinbase, Polycoin allowed compliance officers at retailers to learn more about where funds they received were originating.  “We decided not to focus on the bitcoin itself but rather on the technology supporting it,” Shaffir explained. “So we took the core technology, now it’s not a merchant tool, but it's a tool for compliance officers within banks.”  Shaffir views Polycoin’s advantage over its competitors to be its focus on know-your-customer (KYC) compliance as opposed to strict anti-money laundering (AML), and its ability to deal with potential identity fraud.  Polycoin said it expects to graduate from the Citi accelerator in December and exit the Nordea accelerator in February.
