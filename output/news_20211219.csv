42424066,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2jx3h,1639956701,"First Mover Asia: Bitcoin, Ether Have a Quiet Weekend","(Edited by James Rubin)  Good morning. Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market moves: Bitcoin, ether traded steady over the weekend, while luna surged to near a record high.  Technician’s take: Short-term BTC buying could be limited given negative momentum on the weekly chart.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $46,888 -0.1%  Ether (ETH): $3,938 -0.7%  Markets  S&P 500: $4,620 -1%  DJIA: $35,365 -1.4%  Nasdaq: $15,169 -0.07%  Gold: $1,798 -0.03%  Market moves  The crypto market was largely quiet over the weekend after the earlier part of the week’s uncertainties, including the run-up to the U.S. central bank’s eventual decision to withdraw its pandemic stimulus efforts and concerns about the omicron variant of the coronavirus.  Bitcoin, the No. 1 cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was trading at about $47,000 at the time of publication. Bitcoin’s trading volume across major centralized exchanges over the weekend was low.  While bitcoin and ether prices remained roughly flat over the weekend, a few alternative cyrptocurrencies (altcoins) made big moves, both positive and negative. Avalanche’s (AVAX) price dropped by as much as 7% in the past 24 hours, while Terra’s LUNA hit as high as $77.2 on Sunday – just off its all-time high logged in early December.  As traditional markets open on Monday, investors, including those in crypto, will continue to watch how omicron might affect economic activity globally.  Technician’s take  Bitcoin Limited to $50K-$55K Resistance as Momentum Slows  Bitcoin (BTC) sellers remain active despite signs of short-term support on the charts.  The cryptocurrency was trading around its 200-day moving average, currently at $46,000, and is roughly flat over the past week. Upside appears to be limited given strong resistance between $50,000-$55,000.  On the daily chart, bitcoin registered a downside exhaustion signal, which suggests a short-term price bounce is likely. The relative strength index (RSI) is also oversold, which typically preceded price rises similar to what occurred in late September.  Still, the loss of upside momentum on the weekly chart is concerning. Multiple failed attempts at an all-time price high near $69,000 suggests the broader uptrend is weakening. BTC is at a critical juncture and remains vulnerable to another 20% price drop, assuming buyers are unable to hold current support levels.

You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Sunday.  Those same institutions that measured themselves against such benchmarks are now turning to bitcoin. Along with it comes interest in alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins).  Five years ago, there may have been more than a few cryptos out there, but bitcoin accounted for roughly 95% of the entire market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies. In early 2018, it was just about a third of crypto’s market cap as the initial coin offering (ICO) boom led to a plethora of new entrants. Many of the early alternatives died out but others did not (hello, ether). As recently as a year ago, bitcoin boasted 70% of the aggregate market cap. Today, bitcoin has only a little above 40%.  What the DACS?  New entrants have once more grabbed the market’s attention. Some appear to be more than a flash in the pan. Many will never catch fire. By CoinMarketCap’s count, there are 15,765 cryptocurrencies as of Friday morning in New York, and that number grows every day, it seems, with many of those listed not trading on any markets at all.  This past week, CoinDesk announced the launch of something called the Digital Asset Classification Standard (DACS). It covers the top 500 cryptocurrencies by market cap, a reasonable limit on the universe of relevant currencies. The goal is to give investors a sense of where a coin fits in this universe. It answers questions like, “What are its peers?” and “What are its main competitors?”  The six sectors identified are currency, smart contract platform, DeFi, entertainment, computing and digitization. Those, in turn, are broken down into industry groups which, in turn, are each made up of industries.  Give an example already  The DACS is a foundation for building indices, such as the CoinDesk DeFi Index (DFX) and the CoinDesk Large Cap Index (DLCX). Both are weighted by market cap, with the former comprising 10 decentralized finance (DeFi) coins while the latter is composed of eight cryptocurrencies that make up at least 70% of the market cap of all cryptocurrencies combined.  Let’s give a simple example to show how the right index helps evaluate a fund’s performance.  Imagine a high-net-worth banker named Bob. He heard about this whole DeFi thing and decided he better hedge his wealth by putting money into it. After all, if it really is the wave of the future, he may be out of a job in a few years.  Bob called his daughter’s friend, Alice, a portfolio manager in the crypto space. Alice had a fund in DeFi that consisted solely of two assets, Uniswap’s UNI token and Yearn Finance’s YFI. Bob wrote Alice a seven-figure check, and she began trading on July 1, 2021, at which time the portfolio was weighted 50% each for UNI and YFI.  At the end of the quarter, Alice phoned Bob, who had completely forgotten about that fat check.  “Congratulations, Bob! Your DeFi portfolio is up 9.24% this past quarter. That’s the weighted average of the two assets in the portfolio you invested in. It totally crushed the S&P 500, which was down 0.29%. Aren’t I a genius?” she beamed.  On the surface, Alice indeed looks like a great asset manager. But did she really add value? Yes, but not as much as she thinks she did.  Being a crypto SAMURAI  In trying to find the right benchmark for a portfolio, it helps to remember the acronym SAMURAI. That means the index should be:  Specified in advance  Appropriate  Measurable  Unambiguous  Reflective of current investment opinions  Accountable  Investable.  Those are the seven characteristics of a proper benchmark.  (For a good discussion of all this, check out this CFA Society United Kingdom paper.)  In the example above, the S&P 500 was not the appropriate benchmark. It’s a U.S. large-cap equity index, not anywhere near related to DeFi.  Bob tells Alice, “What are you talking about? You got crushed by bitcoin. It returned 30.58% in Q3. That’s 21.34 points higher than your DeFi portfolio.”  Yet, bitcoin, too, is inappropriate. Even though it’s a cryptocurrency – and the first and largest by market capitalization, at that – it’s in the currency sector, as the DACS shows. It’s not a DeFi play, necessarily.  Alice protests Bob’s use of bitcoin. “Okay, fine, you did even worse against ether and everyone knows ether is a big DeFi bet,” he shot back. “ETH returned 42.21% in the quarter.”  Again, that’s another inappropriate benchmark. Ether may be a very popular asset to “lock,” or invest, in DeFi, but it’s in the smart contract platform sector.  In fact, there is an appropriate index for Alice to use and that’s the CoinDesk DeFi Index (DFX). Both Uniswap and Yearn Finance are in it.  During the third quarter, the DFX returned 8.87%. That means Alice’s fund gave Bob an extra 0.37% for the quarter compared to if he had just invested in a fund tracking the DeFi index. That’s a victory, albeit a smaller one than Alice had claimed. It may not have returned the same as bitcoin or ether, but Bob’s goal was to gain exposure to DeFi, not to other types of cryptocurrencies, when he invested with Alice.  Win some, lose some  Fast forward to Dec. 16 and Bob had mixed feelings about his investment. His DeFi holdings with Alice are down 20.40% since July 1, slightly better – though still negative – compared to the DFX’s loss of 20.79%.  Remember, he wanted: 1) to have exposure to DeFi and 2) hire someone who was going to add value. Given that Alice beat the index by only a hair because of Friday’s rally in YFI, he may want to reconsider his investment with her. He could be better off in the long term investing in something that replicated the more diversified DeFi index than investing with Alice in a volatile, two-asset portfolio.  Alice, of course, could invest in any of or all 10 assets in the DFX (or even those outside of it) if her goal is to come up with a DeFi portfolio. How she weighs those assets in her fund is the result of her research and her skill.  For investors, that can be easily measured only when using the right benchmark.",NEUTRAL,UNI | YFI,BTC | MARKET | UNI | YFI | TOKEN SALE,Lawrence Lewitinn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/12/19/how-to-be-a-crypto-samurai,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/21394d2ab211ba4310f78b9a6422607b9fc28f65-1440x951.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
