Founded in 1997, Heartland offers credit, debit and prepaid card processing services, as well as check management and payments solutions. The publicly traded company estimates it has more than 250,000 customers nationwide.  Statements by the companies indicate that Heartland will seek to identify businesses and organisations that may benefit from the bitcoin payment processor’s services, then referring them to the BitPay team for more information.  BitPay said:  “We currently have more than 50,000 merchants accepting bitcoin payments on our platform. Through this referral partnership we hope to reach a number of merchants that are largely new to bitcoin, bridging the gap between the traditional and modern payments industry.”  The news marks the second such referral agreement now in place between BitPay and a major US payments processor following an August agreement with electronic transactions processor Global Payments.

42426297,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJM5lh,1426011031,UK Politician Exceeds Cryptocurrency Crowdfunding Target by 50%,"Gulnar Hasnain, Green Party candidate for the London constituency of Vauxhall, has raised £1,500 through a cryptocurrency crowdfunding campaign.  The campaign’s initial fundraising target was £1,000, but total bitcoin, dogecoin and litecoin donations exceeded that amount by 50%. The funds will be used to pay for marketing materials ahead of the UK's General Election next May.  Hasnain described the support she’s received from the bitcoin community as ""astounding"", adding:  ""It’s just great to feel the love out there from this community of people who aren’t necessarily interested in politics but are interested in change.""  Some 31 people contributed to the campaign with an average donation size of just over £48.  The campaign – which lasted four weeks – closed at the end of February. Hasnain hasn’t yet spent the money raised, but plans to use the funds to pay for leaflets outlining the Green Party’s policies on housing, tax evasion and the environment.  Hasnain joins a number of politicians who are already embracing digital currency donations, including several in the US. The most notable of these is Greg Abbott, the Republican governor for Texas, who accepted bitcoin from his supporters during a 2014 gubernatorial race.  Back in September, Swedish politician Mathias Sundin became a member of his country's parliament after funding his election campaign solely in bitcoin.  According to Hasnain, the blockchain technology that underpins bitcoin has the potential to change more than just how politicians fundraise. It could also be used to make voting simpler and more secure in the future.  ""It’s being tested and there are still issues,"" Hasnain said, adding: ""Though it does have transformative potential.""",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | DOGE | LTC | REGULATION,Eilidh Wagstaff,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/03/10/uk-politician-exceeds-cryptocurrency-crowdfunding-target-by-50,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/058b040a0ba70871cd2fc73c284dcc83abb60564-1500x1082.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42426299,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJM5rh,1426008102,BetVIP Switches Payment Processor Following Change to Coinbase's Terms of Use,"Online bitcoin sportsbook and casino, BetVIP, has switched payment processors following a ""sudden change"" in Coinbase's terms of use.  BetVIP, credited with being the first fully licensed bitcoin sportsbook, enables users to place bets with the digital currency.  Daniel Schwartzkopff, CEO of BetVIP, said Coinbase had previously confirmed in writing that it would act as a bitcoin payment processor for the all-purpose betting platform.  A spokesperson for BetVIP claimed Coinbase now prohibits all gambling, whereas before it only prohibited illegal gambling operations.  Nick Tomaino, business development manager at Coinbase, said he was unable to comment on specific accounts, but countered the spokesperson's claims.  He confirmed Coinbase wallets and APIs ""are open to use for anyone in the world that operates legally, and the same holds true for gambling businesses"", adding:  ""We haven't explicitly dropped gambling business and gambling is actually a growth opportunity that we are excited about in the future as the regulatory landscape becomes more clear.""  ""We do have to be sure that we are fully compliant, though, so we can continue our mission of making bitcoin easy to use for consumers, merchants, and developers around the world,"" he said.  Schwartzkopff said BetVIP's aim was to bring ""transparency and legitimacy"" to a sector that had been ""marred with controversy and fly-by-night operators"". He added that BetVIP provided this, and more, with a public management structure and an eGaming license from the Caribbean island of Curaçao.  The CEO confirmed BetVIP will now process its bitcoin payments through Cubits Pay.

42426301,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJM5xh,1426005686,Bitcoin Startup 21 Announces $116 Million All-Star Backing,"Stealth bitcoin startup 21 Inc, formerly 21e6, has announced new information about its funding history, staff members and investors, revealing it has raised $116m in fundraising over multiple rounds.  In a new interview with the Wall Street Journal, 21 CEO Matthew Pauker indicated that Andreessen Horowitz, Data Collective, Khosla Ventures, RRE Ventures and Yuan Capital are among the firms that have participated in the company’s funding rounds.  Dropbox CEO Drew Houston; eBay co-founder Jeff Skoll; Expedia CEO Dara Khosrowshahi; PayPal co-founders Peter Thiel and Max Levchin; and Zynga co-founder Mark Pincus have also invested in the startup.  Perhaps most notable is the involvement of Qualcomm Ventures, the venture capital subsidiary of the global semiconductor company that designs and markets wireless telecommunication products.  Pauker told the news source that 21 aims to leverage Qualcomm’s production capabilities to develop a suite of undisclosed products to be released in the coming months.  Co-founder Balaji Srinivasan, a partner at VC firm Andreessen Horowitz, compared the ambitions of the project to the development of 56-kilobit Internet modems and wireless Internet towers, suggesting a long-term vision that helps bring bitcoin to consumer households.  The figure would top the $106.7m raised by Coinbase to date through its four public funding rounds. 21 raised $5m in venture capital in 2013 as 21e6.  Job openings hint at 21's products  The new firm's website lists 18 jobs that it is seeking to fill, ranging from an 'ASIC design engineer' to a business development executive for hardware, offering a glimpse into the startup's plans.  The job description for the business development role, for example, asks for candidates who want to ""conceptualise and execute the deals that will make bitcoin happen at the hardware layer"".  The ad for a 'PCB designer' (the acronym stands for 'printed circuit board'), wants applicants who work with teams within the company and customers outside the company on ""integrating our technology into novel bitcoin-related products"".  Taking the details from the Journal article together with the job ads, 21 could be working on a hardware technology at the intersection of mobile devices and bitcoin storage, said one observer of the bitcoin sector, Antonis Polemitis.  Qualcomm role is key  Polemitis, a managing director of investment firm Ledra Capital and a teacher of the University of Nicosia's online course on digital currencies, said:  ""If you're doing hardware and talking about general consumers, you've got to imagine they're thinking of a hardware wallet. We're still at the level of early modems where you have to fiddle with the com ports to make them work. If you messed up then, you just couldn't connect to the internet, but if you mess up with bitcoin, you lose all your money. So presumably we're looking at some kind of simplification.""  Polemitis points to Qualcomm's involvement as a sign that mobile technologies could be at the heart of 21's endeavour.  ""Qualcomm is primarily in mobile technologies, so maybe you could make a phone with a built-in hardware bitcoin wallet. In the same way you where Apple Pay's security isn't dependent on the user doing 27 complicated things, it's simply dependent on turning on your phone,"" he said.  Qualcomm makes the Snapdragon processors that power mobile devices from Samsung, Sony, HTC and other major manufacturers.  For Polemitis, the size of 21's fundraising total also suggests that development of the bitcoin ecosystem is continuing in earnest.  He said:  ""This is a pretty confident bet on the bitcoin space ... you now have a core group of capital providers who are absolutely sold that this is going to be a huge area of development over the next 20 years. They're starting to find the vehicles in which they can place significant bets on the space.""

42426303,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJM5vh,1425999620,"ShapeShift Raises $525k, Reveals Erik Voorhees as Creator","Instant bitcoin and altcoin exchange ShapeShift has received $525,000 in seed funding from investors Barry Silbert and Roger Ver.  The Swiss-based platform, which lets users swap between 25 digital currencies and tokens, differs from traditional exchanges in that it operates without user accounts and requires no form of registration.  Silbert, who invested as part of the Digital Currency Group, told CoinDesk:  ""ShapeShift has reinvented the altcoin market and enables the fastest, most efficient and least risky way for people to exchange different digital currencies and tokens.""  Shapeshifting CEO  As part of the funding announcement, entrepreneur Erik Voorhees has come forward as ShapeShift’s creator and CEO, having operated under the alias Beorn Gonthier – a reference to J R R Tolkein's own shapeshifter – since its launch in 2013.  ""I wanted the early launch of ShapeShift to be about the innovation of the site itself and its advancement over traditional order-book exchanges, rather than about me,"" he said.  According to Voorhees, the $525,000 will go towards improvements to the exchange engine, as well as marketing and legal work in Switzerland, the company's base.  The ShapeShift team now includes eight full-time staffers, including four developers.  Volume increase  ShapeShift claims to have witnessed a staggering increase in volume – 30% every month over the past half year. Besides speed and ease-of-use, the platform – which also offers a browser plugin – says it gives users ""trust by design"".  Voorhees cited the high-profile hacking of altcoin exchanges BTER and MintPal as two key reasons why users need a new kind of exchange, one that doesn't act as a custodian of funds.  ""There is a better way. Bitcoin services can be built to significantly reduce or eliminate the need for trust at all … ShapeShift was built as a demonstration of this principle: exchanges occur without custodianship of user funds. Indeed, there are no user accounts whatsoever.""  The company also runs entirely on bitcoin, so it has no bank accounts and no fiat passing through its books. With regards to regulation, Voorhees said ShapeShift has received explicit favorable legal opinion in Switzerland and complies with all existing requirements in the markets it operates in.  ""Certainly regulations in the bitcoin and finance world can change, so we are watching the space carefully and will adapt as needed,"" he added.

Coinbase  will process users' payments on the platform, which sells a variety of Reddit paraphernalia, including a $142 plush toy of the site's mascot, Shoo.

When the announcement was posted on Reddit it attracted a positive response from seemingly excited bitcoin aficionados.  The news comes a couple of months after Reddit's cryptocurrency engineer, Ryan X Charles, was let go from his post after a brief four-month stint at the company.
