Another surprise: Our bank, Wells Fargo, thinks we may be a money services business (MSB) and has a stack of paperwork for me to fill out. Thank you, traditional banking system. It's not like we didn't spend two hours answering all of these questions when we set up the account or anything.  The document is from Wells Fargo's ""Enhanced Due Diligence Center."" Yeah, you're probably rolling your eyes like I am. Even better, if they don't receive the requested information by the deadline, they'll close our account. Fantastic.  Our contact's name is Alex, and he's actually pretty cool. He knows a little bit about cryptocurrency, but I have to do a lot of talking to explain how a video game company uses blockchain. He agrees we are not a money services business and instructs me on how to fill out the paperwork online.  I'm sure there are lots of other small companies utilizing blockchain technology that are going through similar situations, so this post is dedicated to them. A special dedication goes out to everyone building and innovating in the cryptogames space.  We formed Blockade Games in January to work on our first game, Neon District. The game hinges on a single concept: Almost every item is represented by a non-fungible token that has the ability to become rare and unique through game play.  The things we're doing are new, and finding the right words to describe them can be difficult. But I'll give it a go.  Talking to noobs about bitcoin  Stepping back, when talking to people about cryptocurrency I find most have at least heard about bitcoin. If they're a little savvier, they might know about ethereum or litecoin. Some folks might have even heard about Ripple and XRP, but you can tell them that's a story for another day.  Outside bitcoin, cryptocurrencies can be called altcoins or tokens (there is also an unflattering term that rhymes with ""bitcoin""). Each of these designations has a different definition based on how the coin's blockchain is developed.  Countries all over the world have different ways of classifying them for regulation and taxation. In Singapore, they're considered a product until invested and then they get treated more like a stock. They're a taxable asset in Israel and private money (whatever that means) in Germany.  Rounding up the ranks as the most progressive jurisdictions, Japan and Australia recognize bitcoin as currency, though the internet seems to be in disagreement as to whether either has brought it into full legal tender status. In the U.S., bitcoin and all other cryptocurrencies are regulated as commodities.  So, what makes bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency a commodity? A 2017 article from the Economist explains it pretty well:  ""In economic terms, commodities are vital components of commerce that are standardized and hence easy to exchange for goods of the same type, and have a fairly uniform price around the world.""  In other words, they're fungible. Every ounce of gold or oil will cost the same amount as any other ounce of gold or oil. One satoshi of a bitcoin will always be worth the same amount as all other satoshis in a bitcoin, just like pennies in a dollar.  That's why it's so easy to trade cryptocurrency like stocks. They're fungible and interchangeable so no matter how much of a bitcoin you buy (and you can buy less than one bitcoin), variables like where the bitcoin came from should not change its market value. You'll get exactly what you ordered. Unless you get bitcoin cash, but that's also a story for another day. (Yes, my commentary brings all the trolls to the yard.)  In fact, the permanent public ledgers of these cryptocurrencies are so secure, it's plausible we'll see all forms of stocks and bonds tokenized in the coming decades.  Fun fact: Diamonds are not considered fungible nor are they traded on a commodity market. As anyone who's shopped for an engagement ring knows, each part of a diamond is different in cut and clarity, so much so that the price of diamonds as a whole cannot be standardized. Each diamond must be individually inspected to determine its value.  Just like bitcoin is frequently called digital gold, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) could be called digital diamonds. The value of each token comes from a combination of rarity and identified desirable features.  Talking to noobs about NFTs  In the fall of 2017, teams from Decentraland and Cryptokitties attended the ETHWaterloo hackathon in Canada with a new protocol to play with.  Called ERC721, it was a departure from ethereum's ERC20 standard for smart contracts, which are both programmable and fungible. The features of ERC-20s make them the perfect vehicle for the ICO. But ERC-721s were designed for something different.  The ERC-721 protocol makes each token unique. They may operate on the same smart contract, but each token has its own cryptographic signature.  For example, each Cryptokitty has a unique genetic code that assigns a kitty with physical ""cattributes."" These kitties can then be bred to produce a new tokenized kitty with its own genetic signature reflective of the genetic signatures of both parents. A player can't counterfeit a CryptoKitty as each kitty's authenticity is recorded on the blockchain.  If being able to be able to distinguish a digital original from a digital copy weren't revolutionary enough, CryptoKitties presented another new reality for digital games.  For the first time ever, a player could truly own the digital assets they acquire within a game. When an asset is purchased, owned, or gifted, it belongs to the player and not the game. If the game servers shut down, the assets don't go with it. If a player wants to sell an asset, that's up to them. And one day when enough game developers are using this technology together, players may be able to transfer beloved assets from one game into another.  On the surface, CryptoKitties can be seen as a silly game that briefly possessed people's senses, causing them to spend over $20 million in ether on digital cats. In reality, CryptoKitties is a proof of concept for a technology with a mind-blowing range of potential use cases.  In November of 2017, bitcoin had broken $10,000 for the first time, thousands of altcoins and tokens had been launched, billions of dollars raised by ICOs ... and digital cats became the first widely adopted commercial use case of blockchain technology. It shouldn't come as a surprise, though: games are always a testing ground for revolutionary technologies.  Within a month, at least two to three blockchain games were being announced every day. It's important to note that this wasn't the first time blockchain technology had been incorporated into games or online collectibles. Several projects had already been paving the way, utilizing Counterparty tokens (fungible tokens created on the bitcoin blockchain.) However, the development of a non-fungible token standard was the spark of creativity needed to move crypto-gaming into the mainstream consciousness.  Still not an MSB  It's May 31, and I receive a second identical package from FedEx. I open it with a lot more side-eye than curiosity this time.  Of course, it's another money services packet from Wells Fargo. This time the letter informs me that that the bank has not received the requested information. At this point, I'm pretty confused because I know I sent back everything they needed the first time around.  Fortunately, there is an email waiting for me from Alex stating that they had the original document and just needed to clarify a couple more items.  I'm realizing that a large part of my job now involves educating professionals in other fields how to interface with a blockchain business. Especially banks.  Despite the fact that we can accept crypto as a currency and will occasionally pay for business operating expenses with crypto as a currency, our blockchain product is not a currency. I can see why this is confusing as all get-out to them.  Comparing NFTs to baseball cards is helpful. You can't use a baseball card as money, but someone may pay money for a baseball card based on its unique and rare attributes.  Alex thanked me for my help in understanding this new and crazy world. I'm sure it's not the last time I'll be explaining how this works.

42380848,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8zl9F,1529228125,"In the Scramble to Fix Digital Identity, uPort Is a Project to Watch","Talk to any three blockchain entrepreneurs, and at least one of them will pitch a way for internet users to own their own data.  Recent privacy debacles at Yahoo, Equifax and Facebook have driven home the realization that anyone with a smartphone is walking, talking, searching, eating, posting, browsing fodder for advertisers, machine learning algorithms and thieves. And users neither control this data nor receive any compensation for giving it up.  Yet, blockchain fever – entering the mainstream at the same time as this data sobriety – appears to provide an antidote, and a rash of decentralized applications has appeared to help users monetize their data.  Using cryptographic technology such as public-private key pairs, such projects aim to let users of digital services control the data they produce, many times offering a marketplace where users can do things like selling their Yelp bookmarks to an advertiser for a few bucks' worth of cryptocurrency.  But the team at uPort, an ethereum-based identity protocol, is going after a bigger prize.  Rather than ask, ""How can I get paid for my data?"" uPort aims to answer, ""Who am I in the digital age?""  For Reuven Heck, co-founder and project lead at uPort, this isn't the kind of problem that can be answered with just another app. Because the internet wasn't built with an identity layer embedded, Heck said, tweaking the top of the internet – the application layer – just isn't cutting it.  Rather, the internet needs to be rebuilt at a deeper level, and according to Heck, uPort aims to do just that:  ""We believe we now have technology that allows us to build this as a horizontal layer across the internet … without being owned and controlled from an individual company.""  That ambition has led uPort – among the oldest projects under the umbrella of ethereum startup and incubator ConsenSys – to be regarded as one of the most exciting blockchain-based approaches to rationalizing users' scattered, insecure digital identities.  The internet of identity  It's notable that uPort has managed to attract a significant amount of interest despite not being focused on the end users.  According to Danny Zuckerman, uPort's head of strategy and operations, the project emerged from persistent calls across the ethereum developer community for an identity system – preferably a decentralized one, given ethereum's fundamental mission.  With that background, uPort decided the best approach was to give developers with a way to delegate the task of storing user-specific data on the blockchain by, Heck said, ""integrating a few lines of code into your application.""  And yet, it's not necessarily safe to assume that uPort will only be buried in decentralized applications' innards, hidden from end users.  ""There will be a lot of different ways that users interact,"" said Zuckerman, because ""it's really this identity layer for the internet, and there's not one way you interact with the internet.""  To explain what was meant by an identity layer for the internet, Zuckerman began with the ""top-down mechanism"" of the analog world, in which the government defines an individual's identity in a limited number of ways: a passport number, a national identification number, a Social Security number, a driver's license number. The specifics depend on the jurisdiction, but most people have one or two primary, officially sanctioned identifiers.  The web, by contrast, is a free-for-all.  ""With the internet there started to be all kinds of other identity systems, typical username and password – basically anything where you identify who you are and create an account – and so there was this proliferation of many, many identities,"" Zuckerman said. ""And that started having user data captured in lots of different places, not under their control.""  And for many blockchain enthusiasts, that just doesn't make sense. On the one hand, these multiple identities are challenging for everyone to juggle (without being subject to security slip-ups). On the other hand, allowing a single, centralized party take over digital identity is not ideal either.  Rather, uPort's idea is to put users in charge of holding and, if they choose, sharing the data associated with their identity, using the same cryptographic protocols that allow them to control cryptocurrency without the need for a third party. And this goal is frequently called ""self-sovereign identity.""  A crowded space  UPort is far from the only project working towards the goal of self-sovereign identity using blockchain technology.  The Sovrin Foundation is one of the most prominent examples of uPort's competition.  The foundation is behind Project Indy, a set of identity tools launched last year by the Hyperledger consortium. In contrast to public, permissionless uPort, Indy is a hybrid: anyone can view the ledger, but writing to it requires permission. Also in contrast to uPort, Project Indy is planning an ICO.  Civic, which plans to fully roll out its identity platform later this year on RSK, a layer-two bitcoin smart contracts platform, recently raised $30 million in an ICO.  Microsoft and Accenture have unveiled an identity prototype that uses a private, permissioned version of ethereum.  Meanwhile, developers on the public ethereum network are working on a standard for tokenized identity. Called ERC-725, the standard is being spearheaded by Fabian Vogelsteller, the creator of the ERC-20 standard that powered a boom in the crowdsale of crypto tokens.  Finally, the team at Digital Bazaar – which has been working with the World Wide Web Consortium, a standards body – has launched an experimental ""testnet"" version of a blockchain-based identity solution called Veres One. Like uPort, it is public, permissionless and lacks a token of its own. Unlike ethereum-based uPort, however, it is a freestanding blockchain.  The risk of having all of these divergent, competing standards for blockchain-based identity is that they will recreate the current system: fragmented and siloed.  But most of these projects' teams, including uPort's, are aware of the risk and working with different standards bodies to try and build an interoperable system. UPort, for instance, joined the Decentralized Identity Foundation – which includes big names like Microsoft and Accenture, among others – in order to develop a standard for everyone.  Heck underscored the importance of interoperability by citing the examples of WeChat, WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger. As impressive as these messaging apps' userbases are, he said, ""nothing really has replaced email.""  The reason, he continued, is that:  ""Email's the only universal thing which works across the world. You can send emails from anywhere to anyone. Everybody has something that's compatible.""  Trying to go it alone is just bad business, he added, saying, ""No solution that thinks they are winning now because they were earlier will win if they're not on a joint standard.""  Momentum and roadblocks  And while all these solutions have made significant progress over the past year, uPort has a whole group of potential partners and clients in the various other ""spokes"" of ConsenSys. One of these spokes, Viant, is currently integrating uPort, while others – including OpenLaw, Meridio and Civil – are planning to do so.  Tyler Mulvihill, the co-founder of Viant, which plans to go live with its ethereum-based supply chain platform this year, told CoinDesk that using uPort as its identity solution was ""a really easy decision,"" not only because of the ConsenSys connection, but because ""they're leading the space in self-sovereign identity.""  Gnosis, a prediction market that was spun out of ConsenSys, used uPort to verify that each user was only submitting one entry to its Olympia tournament.  Outside of ConsenSys, Melonport, a decentralized asset manager based in Zug, Switzerland, is using uPort to perform know-your-customer and anti-money laundering (KYC/AML) checks.  But uPort's most notable partnership is with the government of Zug itself, which is conducting a pilot program to register citizens' IDs on ethereum. The first registry was completed in November, and the total is now over 200. The city government then announced a voting pilot using uPort last week.  Another pilot, in which uPort and Microsoft partnered with Brazil's Ministry of Planning to verify notarized documents, began in June 2017. According to Heck, more such partnerships could follow.  ""We are talking to other cities and governments at the moment – none of them we can talk about at this point,"" he told CoinDesk.  In many respects, though, uPort has a long way to go.  The same questions that nag the ethereum ecosystem as a whole can make the way forward uncertain for uPort. How to scale the network to enable faster and cheaper transactions is a major hurdle.  Also important – arguably more so, given uPort's focus on identity – is the question of how to protect users' privacy when using a blockchain like ethereum, which is visible to anyone.  ""Transparency in blockchain is obviously a feature,"" said Zukerman, ""but when it comes to personal data and identity data it's a liability.""  Finally, there's the question of what happens to a user who loses their private key, and with it, presumably, control over their digital lives. UPort has explored different solutions to this problem, starting with designating friends who can collectively vouch for a person and transfer the lost ID's data over to a new public key. That was an ethereum-specific solution, though; the team is now working on a blockchain-agnostic one.  But still, even with these roadblocks, uPort has had no problem with its main goal, convincing developers to use its platform in their applications. Heck concluded:  ""People come to us.""
