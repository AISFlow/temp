Allegedly perpetrated from March 2013 through August of this year, the scheme centered on a cryptocurrency called cachecoin, whose market is said to have been manipulated by the actions of the defendants.  The five individuals, which include a married couple, as well as a company called Scrypted Life, are also accused of stealing funds raised for an independent mining operation, Fibonacci Scrypt Mining ASICs.  Represented by Florida-based law firm Akerman LLP, the plaintiffs are seeking loss-of-profit damages, as well as reparation for legal costs, and have requested a trial by jury.  Akerman attorney Christopher Hopkins told CoinDesk that those named in the case used a variety of means to collect funds from unsuspecting investors.  By including an alleged pump-and-dump scheme in the plan, he said, the group was able to further boost its fraudulent revenues, explaining:  ""They conned investors and buyers to convert their money to cachecoin, claiming a discount for any investment or purchase with Fibonacci in cachecoin. In the end, after taking money from my clients and others, we believe that the Fibonacci defendants also walked off with ‘pump-and-dump profits' from cachecoin.""  The defendants have been charged with fraud, unjust enrichment, false advertising, negligence and violation of state investment statutes, according to documents filed 3rd December.  Broken promises  Court documents provided to CoinDesk state that the defendants allegedly used social media platforms such as Litecoin Talk to promote and sell mining units that were never developed or delivered by Fibonacci.  Fibonacci allegedly conducted a broader, multi-layered promotional campaign that resulted in several different money-generating initiatives, including the ASIC presales and the pump-and-dump scheme in the cachecoin market.  The Fibonacci ASIC – a project that followed an previously planned mining unit – was announced in December 2013. The Fibonacci group began accepting pre-orders in March 2014.  Fibonacci purportedly enticed customers to convert bitcoins for cachecoins in exchange for a discount on mining devices that were said to be in development. This led to a rise in volume and the overall price for that altcoin – an event that the documents say was planned by Fibonacci so it could profitably sell its holdings to unsuspecting customers.  Both plaintiffs involved exchanged bitcoins worth thousands of dollars at the time for cachecoins, and sent those coins to the Fibonacci group as payment for the scrypt ASICs. One plaintiff bought about $18,000 dollars in cachecoins, while the other purchased roughly $30,000-worth.  The documents explain:  ""Unbeknownst to plaintiffs, this was part of defendants’ scam to not only take plaintiffs’ money directly but to profit by having plaintiffs and other 'buyers' and 'investors' use cachecoin, which increased the value of cachecoin. This was of interest and profit to defendants, who were responsible for launching cachecoin.""  Both payments were issued on 17th March. One of the plaintiffs, the court filings state, later received a partial refund worth approximately $3,500 in July.  Fibonacci told customers at the time that both the ASICs would be delivered and the mining operation started in August.  Collapse in August  When the anticipated date arrived, however, the filings argue neither the ASICs nor the planned mining operation had materialized.  According to posts on Litecoin Talk, customers stopped hearing from Fibonacci staff. At the same time, the Fibonacci website, through which payments were being processed, went offline. Compounding the situation was the sudden drop in the price of cachecoins, which according to the plaintiffs has continued to this day.  Plaintiffs argue Fibonacci’s actions resulted in both the loss of profit from mining units that were never delivered, as well as damages through the eventual collapse in the cachecoin market.  The filing states:  ""At or around August 2014, Cachecoins were essentially worthless. As of today, Cachecoins are worth less than $0.0003 cents with little interest or activity.""  Hopkins said that the defendants named in the case have been served, and that ultimately, cases like this could lead to a more transparent environment for potential investors.  “These suits may just run out of town the scourges who see financial potential in the virtual currency space through ploys and scams rather than diligence and ingenuity,” he said.

42398074,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbG49O,1418845830,Future Unclear for Romanian Bitcoin Exchange as Users Withdraw Funds,"Update (18th December 09:46 GMT): The latest update on the BTCXchange website states: ""Please imperatively to withdraw money from BTCXchange.ro platform. We currently do not have access to the server!""  Update (18th December 03:30 GMT): Updated with comment from Coinzone.      BTCXchange, Romania's only order-book bitcoin exchange, has issued a statement encouraging all users to withdraw funds from the platform by Friday, 19th December.  Exchange users were asked to withdraw funds denominated in both bitcoin and US dollars due to unspecified ""security reasons"". Further, it remains unclear whether the exchange plans to shut down permanently or if services could be reinstated.  The full message from the BTCXchange, posted on its website and Facebook page, reads:  ""Due to security reasons, we ask all BTCXchange.ro platform users to withdraw all their funds, both fiat and BTC (bitcoin), from their platform accounts until December 19th, 2014 and to trade no more. We apologize in advance for any inconvenience.""  The service interruption is notable given that the exchange had recently partnered with e-commerce processor Netopia mobilPay to enable 6,000 retailers to accept bitcoin payments.  Founded in January 2014, BTCXchange aimed to provide a destination for bitcoin traders who wanted to transact with the Romanian leu, the European country's native currency.  A representative of Bitcoin Foundation Romania suggested that BTCXchange had as many as 3,000 accounts and 50 BTC (roughly $16,000 at press time) in daily volume before the announcement. Data from Bitcoin Charts suggests this has since fallen to 3 BTC.  CoinDesk attempted to reach out to the owners of the exchange through both its general email, as well as the emails of its operators. At press time, operator emails were seemingly discontinued, while messages to the support team had gone unanswered.  6,000 merchants unaffected  According to statements from Netopia mobilPay, the issues at exchange will not affect its ability to allow merchants to accept bitcoin, since BTCXchange did not handle processing on behalf of retailers. Netopia mobilPay also partnered with bitcoin processor Coinzone at the time to enable this part of its service.  Representatives from Netopia mobilPay declined to comment further on the exchange's latest announcement, although they expressed optimism about their bitcoin program, as well as the prospects for bitcoin adoption in Romania.  ""Our plans and interest with bitcoin is bigger than ever. We want to position ourselves in the forefront of the regional bitcoin movement,"" Netopia mobilPay CEO Antonio Eram told CoinDesk.  One of the largest online payment processors in Romania, Netopia mobilPay has projected that it will process up to €100,000 in bitcoin payments over the first few months of service.  Effects on Romanian market  Members of the local Romanian market also expressed their hope that the exchange closure would not have an effect on the ecosystem as a whole.  Romania is currently home to two bitcoin ATMs, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin ATM map, as well as its own affiliated chapter of the Bitcoin Foundation and Coinzone, which also houses some of its operations in the Netherlands.  Dragos Birsan, a founding member of the foundation chapter, Fundatia Bitcoin Romaniahttps://bitcoinfoundation.org/2014/08/romania-joins-as-first-bitcoin-foundation-chapter-affiliate-in-eastern-europe/, and CEO of mobile bitcoin app provider Coinfetti, indicated that he is personally pleased at how BTCXchange has so far handled the uncertain situation.  ""I like the fact that they are still processing orders so everybody can get their money,"" he said, adding that he hopes this trend will continue until all customers have received their funds.  Coinzone CEO Manuel Heilmann was similarly bullish about the technology's long-term ability to resonate with the local market, adding:  ""In terms of bitcoin infrastructure, Romania is leading in Europe along with the Netherlands. The situation with BTCxchange is a setback but it won't stop bitcoin in Romania. The remaining infrastructure and eco-system is strong.""  CoinDesk is monitoring this developing story.

42398067,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbG40X,1418841024,Aspen Institute CEO: Bitcoin Micropayments Will Change Banking,"Walter Isaacson, author and CEO of the Aspen Institute, has said the advantages offered by disruptive technologies such as bitcoin will help shape the payments space in 2015.  Speaking to CNBC's Squawk Alley yesterday, Isaacson emphasised that, while payments innovations like Apple Pay are a step forward for consumers, it's important to find new technologies that will disrupt the banking and credit card systems ""so we can have easier payments systems"".  Isaacson said:  ""I'm disappointed a little bit that Apple Pay didn't do it with its own financial thing and decided to do it with people's credit card.""  With his comments, Isaacson joins the likes of Sir Richard Branson and American Express's Kenneth Chenault in recognising the disruptive potential of bitcoin in payments. Others, however, such as Matthew Driver, MasterCard’s president for South East Asia have been more sceptical.  The Aspen Institute is an educational and policy studies organisation based in Washington, DC. Isaacson has previously been the chairman and CEO of CNN and the managing editor of Time, and has written a number of biographies, including one of Apple founder Steve Jobs.  Micropayments potential  Over and above speculation for profit, Isaacson said he believes bitcoin has caught on because of it's potential in micropayments.  ""I can pay 25 cents, 50 cents, whatever,"" he said.  Currently, the traditional banking industry does not allow micropayments, Isaacson pointed out. However, a ""change purse"" of digital currency would allow people to easily reward the creators of songs, blogs and even newspapers.  ""It would start an economy where people could sell things digitally, for small amounts of money, and I think it would revive journalism and many other things,"" he said.  In a recent LinkedIn article on the same subject, he explained that companies such as ChangeTip, BitWall, Coinbase and others will empower creators and consumers of content and eventually strip some of the power away from companies like Amazon, Alibaba, and Apple.  He wrote:  ""This will upend our current kludgy financial system and ignite an explosion of disruptive innovation.""  Isaacson cited mileage and loyalty rewards programmes as another use case for digital currency micropayments. ""That [reward] goes in a wallet, you spend it online,"" he explained.    Digital economy        While acknowledging that bitcoin is controversial in some circles, Isaacson said ""there is a hunger for 'cybercurrency'"" amongst younger people.  Briefly addressing the regulatory issues facing bitcoin startups, he compared the banking institutions to taxi companies, which ""deeply protect"" themselves from disruptive technologies like Uber.  He expressed disappointment that Apple Pay is less of its own innovation and financial technology than something like bitcoin, which requires structural change to use and integrate into society. Instead, its one more way of using credit cards.  Isaacson raised the point that protocols that would allow such micropayments were originally included in the World Wide Web's early development plans. These would have allowed users to make small payments without the ""mental transaction cost and the other transaction cost of going through a credit card or PayPal or Apple Pay"".

The Series A investment was led by Mosaik Partners. Former AOL CEO Steve Case and Crypto Currency Partners also participated in the round.  Formed in May of this year, PeerNova is the result of a merger between mining companies HighBitcoin and CloudHashing. HighBitcoin developed mining hardware, while CloudHashing still sells contracts for mining as a service.  Emmanuel Abiodun, president and CCO for PeerNova, told CoinDesk that, despite the company's new goals, mining will remain a part of its efforts.  Abiodun, who was previously CEO of CloudHashing, said:  “We’re going to maintain the mining side, but it is not going to be the predominant side of our business. We see ourselves more as an infrastructure play rather than a cryptocurrency company.”  The company's revamped website further suggests decentralized applicatoins (DApps), smart property, smart contracts and e-currency software-as-a-service applications will all be of interest as Peernova pursues its new direction.  Abiodun added that he believes the public repositioning reflects an ongoing internal transition at the company, noting: ""We're more of a software business than a hardware business now.""  Infrastructure services  The move may be surprising given that bitcoin mining is a heavily hardware intensive industry. However, PeerNova wants to move more toward software tools that allow companies to use blockchains for different applications.  Peernova said it is working on two products it will announce sometime next year.  Abiodun noted:  ""We're looking more at enterprise solutions. We believe there is a lot that can be done. We don't just like talking about the technology, we believe there are a lot of applications and that’s what we’re working on right now.""  Abiodun mentioned file storage, identity management and secure transfer of assets as additional areas where the company could provide blockchain-based products.  “Our roots do come from crypto, and we’re using the technology that helped bitcoin grow to do other things than simply just currency-related,” he said.  Advanced blockchain applications  A number of companies are now building products that aim to unlock the ability of both the bitcoin blockchain and alternative blockchains to be used for public proof and asset transmission.  The thinking for many startups is that bitcoin technology does not have to be used only for financial innovations, a philosophy that has lead to the emergence of the burgeoning crypto 2.0 sector of the industry.    For example, SmartContract is betting on blockchain technology, not just bitcoin as a currency, for its strategy. Further, Blockstream just raised $21m to build sidechains, new blockchains pegged to the existing bitcoin blockchain, influencing experimentation and brand-new public ledger applications.  PeerNova’s future business prospects are now aligned toward this same business model, one that suggests blockchain-based innovations will permeate throughout the technology industry.  Abiodun said:  “Our focus is going to be a lot more the software stack that fits on top of the blockchain.”  Lightbulb image via PeerNova",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/12/17/peernova-raises-86-million-to-refocus-on-enterprise-blockchain-applications,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/55cb2750d9cbc184c09b729f6914fb3dd928bbf1-1945x1231.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42398064,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbG3zY,1418832041,Bitcoin Firm Enables Remittance Withdrawals at 450 Philippine Bank ATMs,"Philippine bitcoin exchange and remittance service Coins.ph has added an 'instant remittance' service to its list of options, allowing recipients to withdraw sent funds directly from a bank ATM.  Using the company's mobile app, customers anywhere in the world can deposit cash via a bitcoin ATM and have a friend or relative collect it instantly from a bank machine. Money can also be sent directly from bitcoin balances in Coins.ph web wallets.  To make this possible, Coins.ph has integrated with the eGiveCash service operated by the Philippines' Security Bank. Anyone receiving money via this service can withdraw cash from one of bank's network of 450 ATMs countrywide, without the need for an ATM card or a bank account.  Cutting costs  Coins.ph CEO Ron Hose told CoinDesk he believes the service is the first of its kind in the world, and testing it against traditional remittance providers with a $50 remittance resulted in 50% savings on overall costs.  The company is working to extend its ATM pay-out network, Hose added, although that could still take a while to complete.  ""The process is tedious, since there is no single counter-party (other ATM networks only cover card-based transactions). Each integration can take upwards of six months, and there are various technical and other requirements that need to be addressed. That said, the benefits to the customers are clear and we are dedicated to pushing this forward.""  The new direct-to-ATM service is available 24/7 and is fee-free for Coins.ph wallet users.  How it works  To use the service from a Coins.ph wallet, customers select 'ATM Pickup/eGive Cash' under the 'Where should we send the money?' option when using the wallet's remittance function.  The recipient will then receive a message with a 16-digit reference number via SMS. A four-digit passcode is sent separately to the sender via email, to pass on to the recipient.  Next, they must simply press 'Enter' and 'eGive Cash' on any participating ATM, followed by the reference number, passcode and exact amount of the remittance.  Coins.ph requires a Level 2-validated account to send money via eGive Cash. Under know-your-customer and anti-money laundering (KYC/AML) rules this means email and ID verification must be carried out, but address or phone number are not required.  Any amount, from 500 Philippine pesos (PHP ) to 10,000 PHP ($11.20–$223.80 at press time), can be sent per day, or up to 100,000 PHP ($2,235) per month. To put that into perspective, the average monthly salary in the Philippines is around $280.  Emergency lifeline  The personal savings rate in the Philippines, Hose said, is one of the lowest in the world. This means that in the event of an emergency, like 2013's earthquake and typhoon disasters, getting cash into local relatives' hands quickly becomes vital.  Coins.ph's own customer research suggests that emergencies, both widespread or personal like family medical crises or large bills, are one of the chief reasons for overseas workers using the service to send money home, Hose said.  Other than bank ATMs, Coins.ph has a network of over 5,000 existing cash pickup locations. Remitters can also send money to any branch of 24 different banks for free or have it delivered door-to-door for a fee. An additional option is the ability to add the funds to a cash card or cellphone account.  Southeast Asian focus  Filipinos working overseas send over $24bn home each year, paying an average 8% to middlemen. Coins.ph, along with its local competitor Rebit.ph, have worked to employ bitcoin's virtually cost-free international value-transfer network to lower these costs and make the process more efficient.  ""Our priority has always been about offering convenience and equal opportunity. We believe that everyone deserves access to financial services and should have the option to use their money to their desire, without having to endure high fees and prerequisites.""  Hose founded Coins.ph in the Philippines with fellow Silicon Valley entrepreneur Runar Petursson in 2013. On a stated mission to increase financial inclusion in the Southeast Asian region, the company has also more recently opened a second operation in Thailand called Coins.co.th.

42398077,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbG4CL,1418824197,98.6% of TorrentLocker Victims Refuse to Pay Bitcoin Ransom,"98.55% of victims targeted by TorrentLocker do not pay the virus' bitcoin ransom, according to a new report.  TorrentLocker (aka Win32 or Filecoder.DI) is a strain of bitcoin ransomware that works by encrypting users' files. Victims are requested to pay up to 4 BTC to decrypt their documents, though this figure can vary.  The report, authored by Marc-Etienne M Léveillé for security firm ESET, found that only 570 out of 39,760 infected systems were given access to decryption software upon paying the full ransom.  ""In other words 1.44% of all infected users we have identified have paid the ransom to the cybercriminals,"" Léveillé writes, adding: ""There are also 20 pages showing that bitcoins were sent but access to the decryption software wasn’t given because the full amount wasn’t paid.""  Attackers targeted specific regions  Spam campaigns designed to distribute TorrentLocker malware were targeted at specific countries, including Austria, France, Germany, Italy and the UK, the report found.  Turkey and Australia were particularly hard hit by the malware campaign.  According to data from C&C servers, more than 284 million documents have been encrypted by the ransomware so far.  While very few victims chose to pay the ransom, the distributors of TorrentLocker, who are also suspected of being behind the Hesperbot banking trojan, have made a substantial amount of money – between $292,700 and $585,401.  The report notes that ESET identified the first traces of TorrentLocker in February 2014. However, its developers reacted to online reports and changed the way the malware uses AES encryption after a method of decrypting the key was found.  Crypto-ransomware remains a threat  Cybercriminals have been targeting unsuspecting victims with crypto-ransomware for more than a year, with CryptoLocker the leading virus in the field.  In June 2014, international authorities managed to cripple the CryptoLocker onslaught by disabling GOZeuS, the P2P network used to control the network. By the time this blow was struck, CryptoLocker was blamed for causing $27m in damages.  Although TorrentLocker has had limited reach compared to CryptoLocker, in late November the virus was infecting computers at a rate of 691.5 per day. The average TorrentLocker ransom stands at 1.334 BTC with a rebate, or 2.668 BTC afterwards. The exact figure collected by the attackers remains unclear.  Léveillé's report explains why further analysis is difficult:  ""It is hard to say who paid the full amount as opposed to the rebated (half price) amount. Because of this, we decided to use a range to quantify the profit made by the criminals. The total amount of bitcoins ranges between 760.38 BTC and 1,520.76 BTC. With the value of the bitcoin on November 29th 2014 (1 BTC valued at $384.94), it means that they swindled victims out of an amount between $292,700 and $585,401.""  While questions remain about how to stop the operators behind botnets like TorrentLocker, Léveillé suggests one way to remedy infections in the meantime: an offline backup.
