42377947,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LYCD,1421794517,Ripple Labs Names Former Obama Advisor to Board of Directors,"Ripple Labs has named a former economic advisor to both former President Bill Clinton and current President Barack Obama to its board of directors.  Gene Sperling served as director of the National Economic Council during the Clinton years. He was later made head of the economic advisory group under Obama after serving as an advisor to then-Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner. He resigned from the directorship of the NEC in March of last year.  In a statement, Sperling said that he looks forward to helping promote the Ripple network on a broader scale, noting:  ""I am excited to join Ripple Labs and their mission to dramatically increase the speed and efficiency of cross-border payments through a common Internet protocol.”  “As a respected leader on economic issues,” Ripple Labs CEO Chris Larsen added in a statement, “[Sperling's] experience and insights will be critical in building on our recent momentum gaining traction with financial institutions and network operators.""  The appointment follows a busy period for the company, during which it inked partnerships with several US-based banks as well as the global payments firm Earthport. The company’s 20th January announcement suggests that Sperling will play a role in Ripple Labs’ continuing effort to partner with companies in the traditional finance space.  About Sperling  Among the initiatives that Sperling worked on during his White House years were efforts focused on deficit reduction and child healthcare reform. He also served as a chief negotiator during budgetary talks with Congress for both administrations.  Sperling helped pass the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, which deregulated the American banking, financial and insurance industries and has been suggested by some to have laid the seeds for the housing boom and subsequent financial panic of the late 2000s.  Prior to serving as NEC director under Obama, Sperling was an advisor to Secretary Geithner during the 2009 US auto industry bailout and was also involved in economic and financial policy formation prior to his appointment to the NEC, according to his official White House biography.  Beyond his work in the White House, Sperling was chief economic advisor to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential bid.

42377964,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LYWL,1421786449,Investors Sound Off on Coinbase’s Record-Setting Fundraising,"Bitcoin services provider Coinbase announced today that it had closed a $75m Series C funding round from a host of notable investors – to date the largest round raised by any company in the industry.  The confirmation of what had been rumored to be bitcoin's largest-ever funding round inspired widespread reaction on social media, and also had a positive correlation on the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index.  The price of bitcoin rose to $212.99 on the news, up from $205.15 at 14:00 UTC, the time of its publication on the Coinbase blog. A similar spike was also observable in CNY markets.  Following the news, a number of the investors offered comment on the funding round and provided insight into the motivations behind the participation of their respective firms.  Unsurprisingly, most framed the funding as good news for bitcoin, the industry as a whole and for the technology to spread to new markets:  Meyer 'Micky' Malka, founder, Ribbit Capital      Fred Wilson, co-founder, Union Square Ventures      Jay Reinemann, executive director, BBVA Ventures      Tom Farley, president, The New York Stock Exchange      Tim Draper, founding partner, DFJ Growth Fund    Other investors including Andreessen Horowitz, DoCoMo and USAA, as well as former Citigroup CEO Vikram Pandit and former Thomson Reuters CEO Tom Glocer have yet to comment on the news.

42377956,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LYOn,1421762400,Megabank Joins Coinbase's Record $75 Million Funding Round,"Coinbase has raised $75m as part of a Series C funding round backed by a host of impressive first-time bitcoin investors including the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), Fortune 500 financial services group USAA, Spanish megabank BBVA and Japanese telcom giant DoCoMo.  The round, which smashes the previous record for a bitcoin company, was led by Draper Fisher Jurvetson (DFJ) Growth Fund, of which noted bitcoin investor Tim Draper is a partner, and included long-time bitcoin-friendly investment groups Union Square Ventures, Ribbit Capital and Andreessen Horowitz. Former Citigroup CEO Vikram Pandit and former Thomson Reuters CEO Tom Glocer contributed personal investments.  Coinbase  CEO Brian Armstrong sought to frame the funding as one that will help shift the mainstream perception of bitcoin during what has so far proven a rocky year for the industry.  Armstrong told CoinDesk:  ”I think this just really changes the conversation. There’s smart money out there that is betting big on this and is totally unphased by the whims of the price and what the market is doing. They’re much more concerned about the fundamentals of what’s happening in the network ... and across those metrics, everything is looking great.”  He went on to explain that all the participants in the round are excited about innovations in the bitcoin space, and that they want to leverage their investment in Coinbase to learn more about what might lie ahead.  “A lot of these companies they want to invest in category leaders,” Armstrong continued, “and we made a convincing case that that was us.”  Coinbase intends to use its new capital to grow its employee base, while focusing on improving its mobile product as it eyes entry into developing markets.  “We want to expand responsibly,” Armstrong said. “We’re in 19 countries now and our goal is to be in 30 by the end of 2015.”  The $75m figure is by far the largest ever raised by a bitcoin company, doubling the $30.5m raised by bitcoin wallet provider Blockchain and equaling roughly 23% of the public capital raised by the entire digital currency industry in 2014.  To date, the California-based company has raised $106m.  Eleven new countries  While Armstrong didn’t mention Coinbase’s new target markets, he talked generally about the types of markets the company is seeking to capture with its new funding, putting a particular emphasis on the global underbanked.  “In India, there are 100 million phones that are connected to the Internet, 2% of those people have a credit card or bank account and those people don’t have a desktop computer and they don’t have email,” Armstrong said.  He also noted that Coinbase needs to tailor its product to the needs of this customer base, translating the app into new languages, optimizing for slower Internet connections and enabling know-your-customer (KYC) due diligence without a reliance on more familiar identifiers like email addresses.  A sizable amount of the funds, Armstrong added, will be used to meet Coinbase’s regulatory burden in its new jurisdictions, a factor he called a “continued pain point”.  Still, Armstrong believes that Coinbase will also find market share outside the developing world, even if that will be in ways perhaps not expected by early adopters.  “Bitcoin will take off in areas that are underserved by traditional payment systems right now, areas where people’s next alternative is dramatically worse,” he said, citing microtransactions, cross-border payments and peer-to-peer lending as examples of verticals he believes will be profoundly impacted by bitcoin.  Doubling down on tech  Armstrong also continued to emphasize that he believes Coinbase can best secure a long-term future by providing a foundational platform to a new generation of developers through its API platform, Toshi, which it launched in September.  Notably, he suggested that developers might be bitcoin’s most enthusiastic market yet, making the API service a potentially key indicator of Coinbase’s future success.  “There’s a lot more experimentations, and if you go to GitHub, the number of bitcoin projects exceeds those on Stripe, Braintree and PayPal put together,” he said. “Bitcoin has captured the hearts and minds of developers around the world and they’re all trying to build cool stuff with it.”  Armstrong voiced his belief that Coinbase stands to gain by enabling the continued growth of bitcoin beyond payments, empowering developers with the tools to create new behaviors and new use cases for distributed ledgers.  Coinbase claims to have captured 47% of the market with its API, a development he cited as “huge” given that he believes many applications of the technology have yet to be uncovered.  Real user growth  Yet, while Coinbase has certainly improved its platform in many key areas, one issue that is continually dissected by the mainstream press is the overall lack of consumer adoption that has occurred despite bitcoin’s visibility in the tech and financial press.  Armstrong indicated that the company now has more than two million wallet users, and that the firm's metrics suggest user growth does not correlate with the price of bitcoin.  Still, Armstrong asserted that Coinbase’s investors aren’t concerned about the company’s current user base, but are instead focusing on how it can grow in the long term.  “These are the kind of questions that investors were asking, they wanted to see if the fundamentals of this infrastructure that you’re building are there, but not just us, the bitcoin network,” Armstrong noted. “They’re looking at this short-term stuff as a distraction,”  Overall, Armstrong seemed largely conservative when talking about how the bitcoin ecosystem would continue to develop, suggesting he sees the technology’s road to wider adoption as being one that will require persistence and patience.  “There’s never a moment when [adoption] happens,” he said. “It’s like the Internet, there was huge hype, there was a crash. There’s not going to be a moment where everyone says it’s now mainstream, but there will be interesting milestones.”  The case for Coinbase  Throughout the conversation, however, Armstrong made the argument that Coinbase was able to garner its impressive capital because of strengths that go beyond the underlying power and potential of bitcoin.  “We have Fred Wilson as an investor and he thinks we’re one of the best product execution companies he’s ever seen,” Armstrong said, further describing the company’s ability to set and meet goals as “ruthless”.  For example, Armstrong cited his team’s success at signing up billion-dollar merchants and shipping products like its 'Vault' storage accounts, USD balances and account insurance in 2014, while expanding to 18 new countries at the same time.  “When I look back over 2014, we checked off a lot of items for the company and hopefully bitcoin as a whole,” he stated, adding that while the company hasn’t been perfect, it has largely kept the confidence of its users.  For now, Coinbase also has the confidence of a new class of investors that could enable it to pursue an even bigger and bolder vision for bitcoin in the face of the inherent existential risk that dogs the still-nascent technology.  Armstrong, however, asserted that while the mainstream market may not see the big picture of this latest funding round, they will over time.  “Smart money often makes contrarian bets,” he concluded. “That’s how they win big.”  Funding image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/01/20/megabank-joins-coinbases-record-75-million-funding-round,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/818fd27d917f9b899091a52b00443dadb35f6e34-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377961,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LYTp,1421751208,Trustatom Raises $100k for Blockchain-Based Due Diligence Service,"Trustatom has raised early seed funding to the tune of $100,000 with which it will launch CredyCo, a cryptographic due diligence service built on top of bitcoin's blockchain.  The round was led by a group of investors that included entrepreneur Brian Cartmell and Gyft co-founder Vinny Lingham.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Trustatom co-founder Yurii Rashkovskii framed the news as an early step in connecting the technology of bitcoin with “the real world”.  “The most important thing from our perspective is to find users for bitcoin and blockchain technology outside of the traditional and core use of bitcoin,” Rashkovskii said, adding:  “Unlike most of the projects that are active in the space today that cater mostly to the same bitcoin community, what we try to do here is expand that and find applications for blockchain technology.”  CredyCo  will be one such solution. Built on technology provided by the Canadian-based Trustatom, it is a document verification 'software as a service' (SaaS) that Lingham envisions as a niche solution for the venture capital industry.  The company describes the service as using ""a smart contracts and identity technology built on top of the blockchain to ensure the credibility and irrefutability of all statements"".  Targeting venture capitalists  Trustatom ID is the heart of the company's proprietary technology. The company describes it as a “mobile privacy-respecting identity and credentials application”, helping businesses automate 'know your customer' practices and allowing their customers to authorize transactions with cryptographic signatures.  CredyCo will be an SaaS built on that technology, and will aim to automate document-based due diligence processes for companies seeking funding.  For example, firms will be able to record their financial and growth metrics securely, allowing investors to more efficiently assess companies’ credibility and thereby potentially shortening the closure time and increasing the number of successful deals.  Rashkovskii said the service will give companies seeking funding “a strong connection to identities and their credentials and just about anything that can be signed by a third party about you”.  “If you think about the investment market, or rather, the way they have been operating, it hasn't really changed much in the last decade,” he said.  He added:  “This is a way to get this portable trust that enables bitcoin in the first place, and apply it to something different and new using what already exists for things outside the monetary aspects.”  Building bitcoin use cases  Lingham, who is also a Trustatom advisor, was bullish on the potential of blockchain applications, echoing Rashkovskii’s thoughts on closing the gap that separates bitcoin users from mainstream consumers.  “The reality is that the price is not going to move until you find actual functional utility for bitcoins,” Lingham said. “Transferring value of bitcoins is not very interesting, in a sense, because the value fluctuates over time.”  The Gyft CEO has found success with his mobile gift card startup and its growing bitcoin customer base.  However, on the price and functionality of bitcoin, he added:  “There’s not enough volume to make this thing liquid enough – that’s why it’s so volatile.”  That is also why it is imperative that entrepreneurs and developers in the space begin to shift focus to consumers outside of bitcoin, Lingham said, by building products and services with industrial use cases like time stamping, or establishing and transferring property rights.  ""Blockchain and modern cryptographic tricks and schemes allow for new kinds of services to flourish,” said software developer and Trustatom advisor Oleg Andreev. “Companies that provide you with an infrastructure, tools and apps, yet almost completely reduce liability and counter-party risks for their clients.”  He added:  ""’Outsourcing’ soon will stop being an ‘unfortunate tradeoff’ and will be regarded simply as a mutually beneficial cooperation of professionals.”  Images via Trustatom, Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Tanaya Macheel,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/01/20/trustatom-raises-100k-for-blockchain-based-due-diligence-service,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9cc0ebc669e7c2e0f0937621c784ee081801a91c-1000x717.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377960,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LYV5,1421744372,Bitcoin-Powered Crowdfunding App Lighthouse Has Launched,"Lighthouse, the bitcoin-powered crowdfunding application, has officially launched.  The beta version of the app, which developer Mike Hearn described as a specialized wallet for decentralized crowdfunding, is now publicly available for download.  The release follows months of development, which included an investment from noted bitcoin entrepreneur Olivier Janssens.  The app is designed to function as a streamlined tool for using smart contracts to commit pledges to particular projects, which can range from bitcoin development initiatives to charity drives. Currently, the only project available for Lighthouse is a 3.5 BTC fundraiser for Medic Mobile.  Hearn said in an interview that Lighthouse differs from platforms like Kickstarter for a number of reasons, including a lack of processing charges and a built-in gallery of projects.  On the latter point, Hearn suggested that project galleries should be just as decentralized as the funding element, and anticipates directories taking shape alongside a gallery he is hosting for Lighthouse initiatives.  He told CoinDesk:  ""Lighthouse is really only about moving money around, and I think this is going to be one of the things that people find confusing about it. It's not Kickstarter in a downloadable app that's peer to peer to peer. It's the way of handling bitcoins.""  How it works  Lighthouse employs a system of project files that enable users to make donations to projects of their choosing, as well as create their own. The first step involves setting up the wallet and depositing funds.  Supporters of a particular initiative can then download the project file and upload it to their Lighthouse wallet, which gives the user access to the project page where they can see the total amount being raised, past pledges and supportive messages for those involved.  According to Hearn, the app doesn't necessarily need to function as a means for raising funds for development projects. Rather, he sees Lighthouse as a potential funding vehicle for a variety of purposes.  ""I think its perfectly usable for people who are comfortable with bitcoin, but aren't developers or are tech-savvy. You could crowdfund, you know, me and my friends go to a concert and we've got to 'group buy' concert tickets, or group buy a laser tag day or something.""  ""It's not a tool that I want or intend for only bitcoin developers to use,"" he added. ""Even though that may be where it starts.""  Breaking down crowdfunding  In tandem with Lighthouse lies the concept of the project gallery, of which Hearn's Vinumeris Crypto Projects Gallery is the first of what he hopes to be a cluster of galleries that serve – or compete for – particular markets.  Hearn said that because Kickstarter is, at its heart, a project gallery and a financial gateway for funding, decentralizing that process can lead to a more vibrant process by which projects are discovered and supported.  ""What I'd like to see, by unbundling these things, ... is a competitive market of communities and community builders where people are building these project gallery sites,"" he said. ""People can compete on building really awesome sites.""  Building a case for bitcoin  When asked about demand for the service, Hearn said that he isn't expecting huge volumes of users given the size of the bitcoin community today, as well as the niche nature of bitcoin-based crowdfunding itself.  Hearn said he sees a role for cryptocurrency-based finance because of the costs associated with digital crowdfunding.  Ideally, he continued, Lighthouse will attract users not necessarily because it involves bitcoin, but because of the economic benefits of using the app to conduct most cost-effective transactions.  ""This is building the case for bitcoin,"" he said.
