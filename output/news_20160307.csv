42426690,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJw2Vh,1457387442,Complaints Hit 'Record' Levels at Blockchain Amid Confirmation Delays,"While debate remains over the origin and implications of the rising transaction fees on the bitcoin network last week, the sudden increase in network use appears to be creating pressures for industry businesses.  To date, this has mostly manifested in public calls to action by industry CEOs who have taken to blog posts to detail concerns over the current state of the network. Though there’s disagreement on finer points, those wishing to send a bitcoin transaction today are paying higher fees, or else waiting longer to have transactions confirm.  In the midst of this development, bitcoin wallet provider Blockchain has released data that indicates its users are issuing more complaints related to service disruptions, providing a window into how bitcoin’s larger consumer-facing businesses are being affected by the network developments.  Blockchain CEO Peter Smith indicated in a Medium post today that the startup is seeing ""new records"" for support tickets related to ""unconfirmed transactions"", however, it did not go into further detail.  Data provided by Blockchain to CoinDesk indicates that support tickets in this category rose 110% from January to February, a figure that dwarfed a 14% increase observed from December to January.  Blockchain co-founder Nic Cary said:  ""In the first week of March, we've set a company-wide record in issue management. We've had nearly as many cases this past week as we did the entire month of [February].""  Cary went on to state that support tickets are being resolved on average in just over two hours, but that this is putting added pressure on the company’s staff and users.  ""Many of the of the voices opining on the state of the network and scaling debate do not serve end users and so they don't really know how frustrating it's getting for regular folks trying to make transactions,"" Cary said.  Larger debate  Still, just how much pressure this is putting on startup business models, and how much of a concern this should be for developers, remains a contentious topic.  Blockchain’s figures come at a time when industry leaders are beginning to speak out on the issue following a private industry meeting from 26th to 28th February in which the topic of how best to scale the bitcoin network was discussed.  Conversation about the event was minimal until a controversial post by Coinbase’s Armstrong on Friday in which he criticized Bitcoin Core developers, calling the team overly ideological and immature. He further advocated for a proposal called Bitcoin Classic that would increase the capacity of transactions the bitcoin network would be able to process in each data block to 2MB, up from 1MB today.  Such comments set off a firestorm of criticism on social media, inspiring blog posts by developers such as Oleg Andreev, who argued that as the blockchain system with the biggest network effect, bitcoin does not need to rush to add users.  Rather, Andreev argued advances from other blockchain-based systems will simply be added to bitcoin, meaning users are unlikely to adopt another system despite added fees and longer wait times for confirmations.  He suggests that the network’s security and integrity should be paramount, and that they should not be risked on short-term gains.  Network pressure subsides  Against this background, data from 21 Inc indicates that the average fee needed for a 30-minute transaction confirmation was in decline on Monday.  Last Thursday, users needed to pay 60 satoshis per byte for a transaction confirmation time of roughly 30 minutes, a figure that was up slightly from than the 50 satoshis per byte observed at press time.  Data also indicates that the number of blocks that are near capacity or filled to capacity is subsiding after spiking last week.  Adding further fuel to the debate are allegations that network activity contributing to last week’s transaction surge should be viewed as ""demand"", and that a capacity increase is needed to accommodate users who are being denied service.  For example, some observers believe that individuals or entities may be colluding to drive up the number of transactions on the network to sway the ongoing technical debates.  However, Blockchain's data provides evidence that bitcoin’s users are experiencing issues regardless of the root cause.  Cary concluded:  ""Most of these users are not worried about the politics behind technical changes, they depend on bitcoin to be functional and reliable.""

42426677,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJw27h,1457381422,African Internet Pioneer Launches Bitcoin Mining Facility,"Ghana-based IT solutions firm Ghana Dot Com (GDC) has launched a bitcoin mining facility it claims is the first in Africa.  The announcement is notable given GDC chairman Nii Quaynor’s history as an early Internet pioneer. In 1993, Quaynor launched one of Ghana’s first Internet Service Providers, and he has since served on the board of ICANN and the Internet Governance Forum Advisory Group at the United Nations.  As such, Quaynor sought to draw comparisons between the two technologies in an announcement regarding the launch.  Quaynor said in a statement:  ""As one of first African computer [companies], we have an interest in seeing the adoption of computing sciences in Africa. We pioneered Internet development and will similarly promote bitcoin development in Africa.""  GDC said that its support of bitcoin is a bid to help drive cryptocurrency adoption in Africa as it believes the digital currency, and its underlying distributed ledger, the blockchain, have the ability to change global finance.  The company did not provide further details on its mining facility, but claimed its farm is now producing ""several hundred terahashes per second"" of capacity to the bitcoin blockchain.  GDC said it will seek to launch more cryptocurrency products soon, but provided no further details.

42426694,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJw2Zh,1457376320,Bitcoin Faces Extinction Without Core Development Competition,"The former COO of bitcoin social network ZapChain, Dan Cawrey is a Silicon Valley-based writer specializing in emerging technologies such as bitcoin and virtual reality.  Here, Cawrey argues that the bitcoin ecosystem should embrace competition, but create a standards body so that such competition can be properly encouraged and managed.  Successful businesses compete for winning technology standards all the time.  In most of these battles, one standard eventually emerges victorious. The winning standard succeeds because it becomes best option after a hard-fought battle.  This same standards rivalry needs to start happening within bitcoin software development. There needs to be competitive core development teams. In addition, there needs to be some sort of proper industry oversight.  Without this, bitcoin faces extinction because it now needs to iterate. It needs to scale badly.  Bitcoin's adolescence  Probably the best description for what is happening within bitcoin recently came from TechCrunch columnist Jon Evens, who wrote that he believes bitcoin, and derivative technologies like blockchain, ""are still in their gangly antisocial adolescence"".  This is fitting, given Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong's new argument on bitcoin’s longstanding block size issue in which he alleged that some Bitcoin Core developers ""lack maturity"".  To remedy this issue, Armstrong believes it is time for competition in bitcoin development so the technology can push forward.  This has been widely viewed as contentious by members of the community, but perhaps it shouldn't be.  All industries face competitive forces. It's proven strong rivalries create better products. Bitcoin should also have competition, just as other popular platforms do.  Rivalries are what drives innovation. It is what has given us the highest quality technology at the lowest cost possible.  For example, there's Betamax versus VHS in the 1980s, Netscape versus Internet Explorer in the 1990s and DVDHD versus Blu-Ray in the 2000s.  We need this in bitcoin. This needs be done in a public way so this industry can ""grow up”.  Neither side is completely right  It appears there are two sides of the block size debate that cannot work together, but it shouldn’t be so difficult to come to a compromise.  One thing is certain. Existing scaling issues prevent bitcoin from working as well as it should.  An electronic internet-based money should be fast, easy and efficient.  On one side of the debate, there is an immediate need to scale.  Having a backlog of transactions kills the ability for bitcoin to be useful as a transactional tool and forces additional costs on businesses.  Scaling now by increasing the block size would end this threat.  Sure, there is an argument encouraging bitcoin companies to handle bitcoin on-chain in a more optimized way. Optimizations could reduce the number of transactions on bitcoin's network overall, and if this is possible, bitcoin companies should work towards this.  Figuring out how infrastructure can grow will always be an issue. However, this should not be a panacea to switching to larger blocks as soon as possible.  Another side of this debate seems concerned about bitcoin’s security in the face of scaling changes. The hypothesis here is that bitcoin’s future implementation and experimentation needs careful thought.  Yet putting off for the future what is available today is a tireless exercise at this point. Bitcoin is like a startup. Its stakeholders must do what needs to be done to scale. Whatever errors occur can and will be dealt with.  Building better software allowing bitcoin to scale long-term is, of course, necessary. It is part of this side’s argument. Yet it is important to remember that In technology, applying a fix while working on something for the long-haul is normal.  Creating a task force  When it comes to the Internet, its technology is mature and thus debate is normal. Imagine if there were no task forces developing standards governing the internet.  We would be dealing with an internet that was not capable of scaling and rife with technical problems. Instead, proper bodies shape the internet. It has created one of the largest wealth generators of our time.  For example, there is:  Internet Architecture Board (IAB) - which oversees Internet architecture and protocols  Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) - which develops naming standards  Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) - responsible for Internet engineering and standards development  World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) - which develops common standards for the web.  There needs to be a task force working on standards development for bitcoin. There are a few organizations, like Coin Center, doing excellent work on policy issues.  However, not enough has been done yet to professionalize the development of bitcoin.  Brian Armstrong’s argument that a competing team needs to work on bitcoin core is valuable. Even so, this competition needs to lead to less contention.  There needs to be a governing body or task force that is neutral toward competitive development. This bitcoin task force should only advocate for competitive core development and documentation towards a long-term roadmap.  Just take a look at basic web payment process flow from W3C. Why doesn't bitcoin have established documentation like this?  Building bitcoin's technical future  For new technologies to thrive, they need standards bodies so competing companies are able to work together.  This is true even in emerging industries.  The Internet of Things has the Open Connectivity Foundation. Virtual Reality has the Immersive Technology Alliance. As emerging technology, what has prevented this in the bitcoin industry?  While public debate occurs regarding block size issues, nonparticipant bitcoin stakeholders closely observe. These stakeholders include bitcoin advocates, investors and miners. What most of those stakeholders see is an ugly debate that has now dragged on for years.  Something needs to be done to overcome this impasse. These stakeholders should be demanding a platform to govern competitive core development and provide a proper roadmap for bitcoin's technical future.  Yes, there needs to be more core development competition. But there also needs to be more organization in considering bitcoin's long-term future. Some sort of standards group or task force for bitcoin would help this immensely.  Right now, everything is just moving backward until something like this gets done.

42378644,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7kwml,1457373328,Russia’s Qiwi Pushes Ahead With Controversial 'BitRuble' Project,"While the number of major global banks announcing blockchain tech trials continues to escalate, Russian payments company Qiwi remains a rarity in its home country of Russia.  The payment service announced last September it had built a proprietary digital currency called the ‘BitRuble’, a project that received widespread interest due to the negative climate for the technology in Russia. There, the country’s legislative assembly has been working for over a year on a law that would outlaw some uses of bitcoin.  In a new interview, however, Qiwi indicated that it is still seeking to move forward with the project, and that discussion about the technology in Russia is now becoming more nuanced.  While Russian government officials and agencies initially spoke out against the trial, one going so far as to label it ‘technical hooliganism’, Qiwi said it has now had the opportunity to explain its interest in bitcoin and the blockchain.  But, while Qiwi communications director Konstantin Koltsov told CoinDesk that it believes the talks are becoming more constructive, he said there is still uncertainty surrounding applications of the technology, such as its proposed 'BitRuble' initiative.  Koltsov said:  ""This project can be effective for our market, but there are still misunderstandings concerning the technological and regulatory issues.""  Koltsov said regulators are beginning to educate themselves on the technology, but that such conversations are developing slowly.  To date, Koltsov said Qiwi has presented its vision for blockchain to the central bank, which recently launched a working group to explore the technology, as well as the state Duma and the Ural Forum of Information Technology and Communications.  Three issues  As for how these talks are progressing, Koltsov said he sees three topics of conversation and debate emerging.  For example, Koltsov said that all participants are looking for ways to better identify users within blockchain environments, a development that points to the continued effects of the perception that bitcoin is anonymous rather than pseudonymous, and interest in blockchain analytics firms among global banks.  Koltsov said Qiwi aims to help more domestic institutions develop a familiarity with the technology.  ""We understand that there can’t be the only one beneficiary in blockchain and crypto-products development and are preparing to bring tech issues to the whole market environment,"" he said.  Koltsov suggested that Qiwi is open to discussing projects and sharing data with interested parties that can help it evolve new financial and non-financial products.

42378653,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7kwy5,1457362040,Why a German Power Company is Using Ethereum to Test Blockchain Car Charging,"Amidst an evolution in the German utility industry, one power company is looking to blockchain technology as a means to cut costs and improve its customer experience.  Five years ago, Germany’s government announced its intention to phase out the country's nuclear power plants, a move that came in the wake of the still-unresolved nuclear disaster in Fukushima, Japan. Celebrated by green power advocates and blasted by utility firms, the move has since resulted in a shift in how Germany produces its power, and a need for those utilities to innovate or risk facing a changing marketplace.  RWE  , a German power company with more than 20 million customers worldwide, is one of those firms, operating both coal and nuclear energy infrastructure in the country. According to its 2014 annual report, RWE reported roughly €48bn, or roughly $52bn, in revenue.  Yet like the other utility firms in Germany, RWE is facing a future wherein its primary modes of energy production face regulatory challenges.  This reality has pushed RWE to innovate, and as part of those efforts, the firm has established an internal working team to evaluate how blockchain tech can help it trim costs by lowering expenses related to energy transmission.  The company has partnered with Ethereum-based blockchain startup Slock.it, founded by former Ethereum CCO Stephen Tual, to develop proofs-of-concepts (POCs) involving the technology.  In a recent interview, RWE blockchain team lead Carsten Stöcker discussed one possible application – electric car charging stations that use blockchain-based smart contracts to authenticate users and manage the billing process.  He told CoinDesk:  ""We would like to solve the problems and really push electric vehicle deployment forward by looking into establishing a seamless and affordable electrical charging infrastructure.""  Future of car charging  According to Stöcker, the project has a working prototype that was recently debuted at the Lift 2016 conference in Geneva, Switzerland.  Stöcker said that the next phase involves taking that prototype and moving it to a test bed with real electric vehicles and charging stations, a process that will play out over the next year.  The PoC operates on the Ethereum blockchain, with the charging station acting as a point at which both customer authentication and the processing of payments takes place.  Under the prototype, users interact with the charging station by agreeing to a smart contract that is programmed on top of the Ethereum network. Prior to charging, the user makes a deposit on the network, which is later released after the transaction is complete.  One notable difference between how charging stations function today and the RWE prototype is that users are billed differently.  Rather than having the user pay for the amount of time spent connected to the charging station – generally an amount in hours, users ultimately purchase the amount of electricity consumed during the charging process.  The thesis behind the experiment is that users will save money through the use of microtransactions, and that electricity would be deployed more efficiently as a result of this approach.  Next steps, Stöcker explained, include looking at regulatory requirements that could influence the deployment of such a system.  Stöcker said that the firm has begun this process, with a particular emphasis on Germany as an initial test bed given RWE's existing infrastructure and its understanding of German regulations.  Autonomous business  The push for applying the blockchain represents a possible shift in how the company interfaces with the customers it services. In the case of a charging station connected to a blockchain network, explained Tual, a customer would be doing business with ""machines working on behalf of RWE"".  ""What's really exciting here is that people are going to be able to use smart contracts to contract with a machine directly, rather than contracting with a human being or a corporation,"" he told CoinDesk.  From Stöcker’s perspective, blockchain tech can help reshape how RWE operates those car charging ports – a necessary step, he argues, given what he called a costly process of building and maintaining these stations.  Stöcker suggested that the work on this particular project could blend into other initiatives, including work on autonomous vehicle operation. This concept has been floated in the past as a possible avenue for smart contract application.  He said that the technology ""resonates very, very soundly"" with RWE’s broader vision for technological innovation, calling it ""key"" to those ongoing efforts.  ""We are looking into the combination of blockchain and energy delivery, and we pretty much think that this can change many industries around energy, mobility and supply chain,"" he said.
