Trump the Grinch (TRUMPGRI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPGRI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump the Grinch can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump the Grinch could become the next viral memecoin. Trump the Grinch launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump the Grinch on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump the Grinch by entering its contract address – 93BLFCVkzBwnSUUjiyaVRQSpjEvaXdZe3oS3iyHnhind – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPGRI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trump-the-grinch-trumpgri-solana-memecoin-to-surge-19000-before-exchange-listing-as-doge-and-shiba-inu-fall/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png
38364056,https://cryptonews.com/?p=323765,1735687800,South Korea: Dongdaemun Market Vendors Deny ‘USDT Pay Adoption’ Reports,"Vendors at South Korea’s Dongdaemun Market say there is no truth in reports claiming they are turning en masse to USDT payments. At the start of the month, reports and crypto forum posters claimed that many traders at Seoul’s most famous fashion market were using the USD-pegged stablecoin as a payment tool. But a reporter from the South Korean media outlet Viewers wrote that the claims of mass USDT adoption at the market were “far from the truth.” Dongdaemun Market Lukewarm on Tether? In early December, posters on popular South Korean crypto forums claimed that “mass crypto adoption” was on its way after merchants at Dongdaemun started using USDT for “international transactions.” USDT’s market cap over the past seven days. (Source: CoinGecko) Multiple posters claimed that they had seen vendors taking USDT payments or even paying for goods using Tether at the market. The market, a series of multi-story buildings in East-central Seoul, is a hotspot for fashion and textiles in the capital. Comprised of 30 shopping malls and several outdoor markets, as well as wholesale markets, the area is particularly popular among Chinese shoppers. These include wholesale buyers who purchase items in South Korea for resale in Mainland China. The reports from earlier this month claimed that it was this group in particular that was driving USDT adoption, paying South Korean market vendors in Tether for their wholesale purchases. On one popular thread, South Koreans wrote that “friends who do business with Chinese customers “use USDT a lot.” Another claimed they had “bought items” for USDT at the market, while others still claimed that “about 10%” of wholesale trade at the market was now conducted using USD-pegged stablecoins. However, Viewers reporter Hwang Bo-ram said multiple vendors and traders at Dongdaemun Market claimed that cash, not crypto, is still their currency of choice. Dongdaemun Market in Seoul, South Korea. (Source: Neaners [CC BY 2.0]) ‘Still Too Early for Stablecoins’ Hwang wrote that while the general public is becoming more familiar with stablecoins, “many of the interviewees” the media outlet spoke to said it “is still too early to use them in real transactions.” But these same interviewees “agreed” that it was “possible that stablecoins” could “connect the conventional economy with the world of blockchain in the future.” The vendors hinted that cash transactions, unlike transactions on blockchain networks, are virtually untraceable. Presumably for tax purposes, many traders appear keen to leave as little trace as possible of their transaction records. Lee (given name withheld), a Dongdaemun-based men’s clothing trader of 20 years, told the media outlet: “There have been stories about crypto adoption here before. But the reality is, [stablecoins] are not used much in the market, contrary to the reports. Traders are quite change-averse. And they hate leaving behind evidence of their transactions. That’s why most transactions are carried out in cash here.” Shopping malls at Dongdaemun Market in Seoul, South Korea. (Source: Martin Röll/Großmarkthallen [CC BY-SA 2.0]) Age a Factor? Lee said there was another reason vendors are still uncertain about adopting stablecoins and Bitcoin (BTC) . The vendor explained: “Dongdaemun merchants are not likely to use crypto in peer-to-peer transactions because they tend to use agents to process payments on their behalf. I don’t know what will happen in the future. But I think that most won’t use stablecoins for the time being because of tax-related issues.” Park (given name also withheld), another Dongdaemun-based vendor at “a medium-sized trading company that targets Chinese customers,” said: “Most fashion traders were born in the 1950s and 1960s, so I think it is [difficult for them] to use cryptocurrency.” Regardless, it appears that there is no smoke without fire. In a December 24 article published in Weekly Dong-a , a leading mainstream media magazine, a tech journalist wrote: “While cryptocurrencies were mainly used for illegal transactions in the past, they have recently been actively used in the import and export of general goods such as clothing, textiles, and electronics.” Dongdaemun Design Plaza in Jung-gu, central Seoul, is celebrating the return of the holiday season with its annual media art festival, which drew up to 620,000 visitors last winter. https://t.co/1PEEc3PJ0o — The Korea Herald 코리아헤럴드 (@TheKoreaHerald) December 19, 2024 Smartphone Payments on the Rise The same article also included the sub-headline “Payment with cryptocurrency at Dongdaemun Market.” This prefaced a section on USDT and other stablecoins. Myung-hee (surname withheld), a part-time employee at a popular Dongdaemun shopping mall, told Cryptonews.com : “The stall I work out does not accept USDT or any other token. However, I do see a lot of Chinese customers paying using their smartphones around the area, with local vendors accepting the payments on their own handsets. I have no idea if these are crypto transactions or not – I really couldn’t say.” Dongdaemun to expand green belt to help Seoul become future city https://t.co/PD9MOY5uHv — The Korea Times (@koreatimescokr) October 24, 2023 Another author claimed on December 23 : “If you look around Dongdaemun, it’s easy to see Chinese traders or small import/export businesspeople paying with cryptocurrencies stored in their smartphone wallets instead of dollars, yuan, or Korean won.” USDT is also exceptionally popular in China and other BRICS nations , despite Beijing’s wide-ranging crypto crackdown. In 2019, Chainalysis wrote that Tether “dominates in China.” It called the stablecoin “the de facto fiat in Chinese trading.” The post South Korea: Dongdaemun Market Vendors Deny ‘USDT Pay Adoption’ Reports appeared first on Cryptonews .",NEGATIVE,BTC | USDT,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | USDT,,0,0,cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/south-korea-dongdaemun-market-vendors-deny-usdt-pay-adoption-reports/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/38364056.jpeg
38363268,https://crypto.news/?p=14323697,1735687800,Choosing this altcoin could be like buying Solana under $1 again,"Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Crypto watchers suggest choosing Remittix while under 2 cents could be like buying Solana under $1. Table of Contents Solana holders flock to Remittix’s PayFi solution Solana could offer less returns than Remittix Remittix: The crypto presale of the year According to experts, investing in Remittix (RTX) at under 2 cents could be one of the best crypto plays of 2025. Remittix’s presale is reminiscent of the early days of Solana (SOL) when the altcoin sold for less than $1. With its transformative PayFi ecosystem and growth potential, Remittix might become the next big thing in the crypto market. As early investors saw huge gains with Solana, buying Remittix now could lead to similarly remarkable returns as the project snowballs. Solana holders flock to Remittix’s PayFi solution Remittix seeks to transform the finance market with groundbreaking technology, following in the footsteps of Solana. While Solana’s relevance fades, savvy traders are flocking to Remittix’s PayFi solution, which will support flawless cross-border trading. Remittix will enable users to make crypto-to-fiat payments globally. The platform will use its native RTX token, allowing any cryptocurrency to be converted instantly into fiat and deposited into a recipient’s bank account no matter their location. Unlike traditional platforms like Stripe and Wise, Remittix will drive global crypto adoption by eliminating the limits of crypto or fiat transactions. The protocol will offer a simple and fast process that differentiates it from the competition. Every transaction on Remittix will be processed through a fully audited smart contract, ensuring 100% security and eliminating slippage. Remittix also prioritizes transparency, giving users access to immutable public ledgers. In addition to these payment advantages, Remittix will provide real-world utility by offering staking rewards. Long-term RTX holders can earn up to 8% APY annually, while VIP-tier investors can receive an impressive 18% APY. Currently priced at $0.0167, RTX tokens offer an ideal entry point for investors looking to get in early before Remittix reaches the Solana level. You might also like: Analysts says SHIB and PEPE’s big gains are over, but Remittix 5,880% rally is just beginning Solana could offer less returns than Remittix Like much of the wider crypto industry, Solana’s price is down. This week, Solana dropped from $200 to $188 as sellers embraced the cautious sentiment that has prevailed. However, technical indicators, such as the 200-EMA ($175) and 200-SMA ($167), suggest that a comeback is possible. There are forecasts that Solana could reclaim the $200 mark in the coming days. Some crypto experts forecast that Solana will reach between $475 and $520 in this cycle, making it one of the top altcoins. Despite these optimistic predictions, Solana’s upside potential appears to be limited when compared to newer altcoins like Remittix. These tokens deliver much higher returns, regularly beating 100x after their presale ends. Remittix: The crypto presale of the year During a crypto rally, it’s easy to make gains, but when these rallies eventually end, a market correction can lead to losses. For those who bought Solana above $190, the current price drop is a painful reminder. As many crypto projects face declines, Remittix, with its unique features and growth potential, is quickly becoming a leading presale token of the year. As investors swap Solana for Remittix, analysts forecast a massive 4,500% gain for RTX by 2025. For more information on Remittix, visit their website or socials .

38363076,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=635550,1735687109,Alibaba in an AI price cut as competition heats up China’s tech space,"Alibaba Cloud, the cloud computing unit of the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holdings, announced on Tuesday that it was slashing prices on its large language models by up to 85%. The firm said it was giving its customers a New Year’s gift by cutting prices on the visual reasoning AI model, at a time when price wars continue to rage in China’s domestic AI services market. Alibaba implements price cut for the third time in 2024 According to South China Morning Post , Alibaba’s announcement, coming on the last day of 2024 is not the first, but the third AI price cut by the cloud unit this year alone. This also comes as competition heats up with similar initiatives implemented by TikTok parent company ByteDance as Chinese tech firms seek to attract users in a crowded market. The Hangzhou-based Alibaba’s cloud computing division made the announcement in a WeChat post its intentions to offer a price cut on Qwen-VL, its visual language model, which is perceived to understand both texts and images. Meanwhile, the e-commerce giant’s shares did not move that much and closed 0.5% higher on the final day of the trading of 2024 in Hong Kong. According to CNBC , the price cuts indicate how the race among China’s tech giants to win more business for their emerging AI products is intensifying. It remains to be seen if the pricing strategy will drive widespread adoption of tech firms’ products and services or if it just ignites a price war that will erode margins within the sector. According to Gurufocus , Alibaba’s strategy could be the masterstroke in this increasingly crowded AI space. The company wants to be the go-to supplier for firms that want to integrate AI into their operations without breaking the bank. Alibaba faces strong competition from peers in China Competition for large language models on the Chinese market has intensified in the past year as each tech giant seeks to stay ahead of the AI race. This follows the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in November 2022 to immediate success, which spurred generative AI developments across the globe. Chinese tech firms also intensified efforts to come up with their home grown alternative to ChatGPT, which is not officially available in the Asian country. In the past 18 months, major Chinese tech giants including Alibaba, Baidu, Tencent, JD.com, Huawei, and ByteDance have launched their own large language models as they seek to capitalize on the hype around the AI technology. For these tech firms, price cuts and promotions have become one of the ways to lure users into this cut-throat industry. As for Alibaba, this is not the first time it has cut prices to incentivize businesses to use its products as the firm implemented another price reduction of up to 55% on a wide range of its AI products in February. Alibaba implemented another price reduction in May on its Qwen AI model by as much as 97% to bolster demand for the service. Large language models are AI models trained on huge quantities of data to create humanlike responses to user queries and prompts. These models are the basis for today’s generative AI systems like OpenAI’s ChatGPT. According to CNBC, Alibaba’s large language model efforts are mainly focused on the enterprise segment rather than consumer AI chatbots like ChatGPT. Alibaba revealed in May that its Qwen model is already used by over 90,000 enterprises. The price cut could open more doors for broader adoption.

38362420,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=314730,1735686119,Terraform Labs Founder Do Kwon Handed Over to US Authorities Days After Montenegro Approved Extradition: Report,"Montenegrin authorities extradited crypto entrepreneur Do Kwon to the United States on Sunday to face fraud charges related to the $40 billion collapse of the Terra ecosystem in 2022. According to a Reuters report , Kwon, who co-founded Terraform Labs, was arrested in Montenegro last March while attempting to board a flight using a fake Costa Rican passport. He had evaded authorities since the May 2022 crash of his TerraUSD and Luna cryptocurrencies. The extradition followed the Montenegro Constitutional Court’s rejection of Kwon’s final appeal. “It was concluded that the majority of the criteria prescribed by law favor the extradition request from the competent authorities of the United States of America. Consequently, the Minister of Justice issued a decision approving the extradition of Kwon Do Hyung to the United States, while simultaneously rejecting the extradition request from the Republic of Korea.” Kwon faces multiple charges in the US, including fraud and conspiracy. He also faces similar charges in South Korea. Kwon’s Terraform Labs created TerraUSD, a “stablecoin” designed to maintain a constant $1 value. Its collapse triggered a wider crypto market downturn and left thousands of investors with significant losses. US prosecutors allege Kwon misled investors about the stability of his digital tokens. If convicted, he could potentially face decades in prison.

XRP is reshaping the world of global payments with its swift and cost-effective transactions, while Solana offers a state-of-the-art solution for speedy and reliable blockchain operations.

The 3BAY token presale is a beacon for substantial returns and vibrant community engagement, exemplifying the profound impact blockchain is having on various industries, with Web3Bay distinguishing itself by concentrating on tangible benefits for users.

Picture a marketplace where consumers wield control, liberated from the constraints of intermediaries and excessive fees. This vision positions Web3Bay as a formidable contender to traditional e-commerce giants, promising not just a new platform but a movement that rewards its participants financially and functionally. Central to this ecosystem is the 3BAY token, which functions as both the medium of transaction and the voice of the community. The presale price of $0.003 is a golden opportunity for early investors, with each phase of the sale raising the price by 15%, leading to a potential final price of $0.1959.

XRP to $50 in 2025: Insightful Forecast or Mere Speculation? XRP is in the spotlight, buoyed by optimistic forecasts projecting its value could soar to $50 by 2025. This enthusiasm is rooted in XRP’s capability to facilitate quick, cost-effective, and scalable global payments, making it highly attractive to financial institutions worldwide. However, the shadow of its ongoing legal struggles with the SEC looms large, potentially stifling its ascent. Despite this, there is a tangible sense of optimism that forthcoming regulatory clarifications, especially with a possible pro-crypto SEC chair, could unlock vast institutional demand, propelling XRP’s market value. Will Solana Achieve a $1,000 Valuation by 2030? Solana has captured the attention of the crypto community with its rapid transaction capabilities and minimal fees, evidenced by its substantial market cap of over $91 billion as of December 2024. Despite experiencing significant price volatility, Solana’s ecosystem has demonstrated robust growth, with its Total Value Locked in DeFi soaring from $1.45 billion in 2021 to more than $6 billion. The vision of reaching a $1,000 valuation by 2030 hinges on ongoing technological advancements, ecosystem expansion, and broader adoption, positioning Solana as a prime candidate for substantial long-term growth. Key Insights The transformative potential of blockchain technology is vividly illustrated through initiatives like XRP, Solana, and Web3Bay. While XRP enhances global payment systems and Solana amplifies scalable DeFi solutions, Web3Bay innovates within e-commerce by integrating blockchain advantages with everyday functionality. These platforms not only pave the way for future industry standards but also provide a lens through which we can reimagine the intersection of technology and practical application in the digital age.

38362375,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=668478,1735686007,Market Alert: Bitcoin’s $81K Support Zone Could Decide Its Next Big Move,"As Bitcoin continues to slowly decline in price, the asset appears to be moving closer to a key psychological level. With uncertainty surrounding the continuation of Bitcoin’s current trend, speculation remains divided on whether the crypto asset is preparing for another upward breakout or entering a phase of correction. Recent on-chain data suggests that specific metrics, such as the realized price for short-term holders, are providing essential insights into the market’s behavior and potential future direction. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Key SOPR Metric Holds Steady: Are Long-Term Holders Eyeing Higher Prices? Key Support Level Identified at $81,000 In an analysis recently uploaded on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform, an analyst known as Shayan BTC revealed that the realized price metric, particularly for the 1-3 month UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) age band, serves as a critical indicator for assessing investor sentiment among newer market participants. This metric represents the average purchase price of Bitcoin for those who acquired the asset within the last one to three months. A sustained price above this level typically signals bullish momentum, suggesting that recent buyers are confident in holding their positions despite prevailing market volatility. Conversely, if Bitcoin’s price drops below this level, it may indicate potential selling pressure as these short-term holders attempt to limit their losses. According to Shayan, the realized price for Bitcoin’s 1-3 month holder cohort currently stands at $81,000. This level is seen as a vital support zone, acting as a “psychological and technical defense” line for both short-term and long-term investors. Historically, when Bitcoin’s price remains above this threshold, it indicates a resilient market sentiment where recent buyers demonstrate confidence in the asset’s future price potential. On the flip side, a price drop below the $81,000 mark could lead to increased selling activity, primarily driven by short-term holders looking to exit their positions to minimize potential losses. Such a scenario would likely add downward pressure to the market, potentially triggering broader sell-offs. Bitcoin Market Performance Bitcoin has so far given investors a boring holiday season with its lackluster performance. Particularly ever since the past weeks towards the middle of December, Bitcoin has fallen below the $100,000 price mark and has remained below it with little to no upward movement. Over the past two weeks, Bitcoin has now dropped by 10.9%.2% as it remains below the $100,000 price mark. However, its past day performance has been quite interesting. Over this period, BTC has seen a sudden increase of 4% to a current trading price of $95,519, at the time of writing. Interestingly, despite this sudden surge, this price mark puts Bitcoin at a roughly 11.9% decrease away from its all-time high of $108,135 registered in the middle of December.

That means the committee behind the proposal has exactly 18 months to collect 100,000 signatures before the proposal can be put to a referendum. The “Bitcoin initiative” aims to include Bitcoin in the central bank’s financial reserves , which some have claimed would hedge the country’s economy from external factors. The “Bitcoin initiative” needs 100000 signatures to move to the next phase The Swiss “Bitcoin initiative” was put forward by 10 people, including Yves Bennaïm, founder of the nonprofit think tank 2B4CH, who led the movement. The initiative aims to incorporate Bitcoin into the country’s financial reserves by advocating for amendments to Article 99 (Clause 3) of the Swiss Constitution, which currently mandates that a portion of the country’s reserves be stored in gold. Proponents have argued that Bitcoin should be treated similarly to gold, saying the asset could boost the country’s autonomy and protect the company’s economy. Now that the Swiss Federal Chancellery has officially registered the initiative, the committee in charge must obtain 100,000 signatures in 18 months. If the signature collection phase is successful, the proposal will be forwarded to the Swiss Federal and then put to a public referendum to decide if any amendments will be made to the Swiss constitution. The US, Germany, and Hong Kong are considering Bitcoin reserves The Swiss “Bitcoin initiative” registration comes at a time when multiple other nations are considering starting their reserves. For starters, Donald Trump proposed a Bitcoin reserve plan at the Bitcoin Nashville Conference 2024. Moreover, Wu Jiezhuang, Chairman of Hong Kong’s Web3 Virtual Asset Development Subcommittee, also advocated for the city to include Bitcoin in its exchange fund, claiming could help bolster financial security. Former German Finance Minister Christian Lindner also advised the European Central Bank (ECB) and the German Bundesbank to integrate Bitcoin into their reserves. He said : The new Trump administration is pursuing an extremely progressive policy on crypto-assets such as Bitcoin. In Washington, there is even consideration of the Federal Reserve including crypto-assets alongside currencies and gold in its reserves. ~ Christian Lindner Nonetheless, Switzerland’s approach to a possible amendment to its constitution could lead to nations following the same process, especially with Trump’s victory making the world optimistic about crypto asset trading and regulation.

38361766,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=635534,1735684251,Syria proposes to legalize Bitcoin for economic recovery,"Syria, a country picking up the pieces after the collapse of the Assad regime, is preparing for a radical financial overhaul: Bitcoin legalization. The Syrian Center for Economic Research has proposed an ambitious plan urging the transitional government to adopt Bitcoin and other digital assets to address inflation, stabilize its economy, and attract global investments. The plan comes as the nation faces an insane challenge of reconstruction after decades of war and financial devastation. The proposal focuses on using Bitcoin as a lifeline for Syria’s citizens and its crumbling financial system. It suggests a regulatory framework to legitimize the use of Bitcoin for trading, mining, and financial transactions. A blueprint for Syria’s financial revolution But they’re not stopping there. The Syrian pound is set to go digital, backed by gold, dollars, and Bitcoin itself, providing a much-needed anchor for the weak currency. This approach could completely change the financial sector in Syria, where inflation and devaluation have eroded trust in traditional banking. “The central bank will oversee the process, ensuring it operates within a secure and accountable framework,” the proposal says. Another key element of the plan is using Syria’s untapped energy resources for Bitcoin mining. Entrepreneurs will be allowed to mine Bitcoin, but not without oversight. The government intends to prevent monopolies and ensure the environmental and social impact of mining remains in check. Financial institutions are also being brought into the fold. Banks, startups, and currency exchanges will be encouraged to integrate Bitcoin into their operations. This could simplify remittances for the millions of Syrians dependent on funds sent from abroad and offer a lifeline for businesses crippled by years of instability. The proposal also says it wants citizens to retain full self-custody of their digital assets. Privacy and security are apparently front and center, with promises that users can transact freely without fear of interference, all while adhering to local and international laws. Even before Bitcoin legalization became a possibility, crypto was already pretty popular in Syria, though perhaps not always for the right reasons. Groups like Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a key player in the opposition, have been using Bitcoin to fund their operations. HTS has once been linked to al-Qa’ida, and has a history of raising money through crypto donations, despite international sanctions. Its leader, Abu Muhammad al-Jolani, is incredibly controversial. Once a member of al-Qa’ida, he’s since distanced himself from the group and sought to rebrand HTS as a legitimate political force. But no one is believing him. Obstacles and geopolitical twists Now Syria’s financial overhaul faces a mountain of obstacles, starting with international sanctions. These restrictions have long isolated the country from the global financial system, and adopting Bitcoin could provoke further scrutiny. Though some experts believe that’s precisely the point. Bitcoin’s decentralized nature offers a way to sidestep traditional banking systems, much like how Iran and North Korea do. Debt is another issue. The Assad regime left Syria burdened with loans and liabilities, adding another layer of complexity to any financial reforms. On top of that, the infrastructure needed to support a digital economy—think cybersecurity, blockchain expertise, and internet access—remains a huge problem. Geopolitics also complicates the situation. Syria has historically been a chessboard for powerful nations, with Russia and Iran playing major roles in propping up the Assad regime. Both countries have strong crypto economies, but their future involvement in Syria’s economic recovery is uncertain. Meanwhile, neighboring countries like Türkiye and Lebanon have also embraced crypto to fight their own economic woes, setting the stage for potential regional partnerships—and rivalries.

Ethereum’s Pectra Upgrade & XRP Price Issues Reviewed,"Success in the crypto world often hinges on the ability to adapt and engage rewardingly. Ethereum is poised to tackle longstanding scalability problems through its imminent Pectra upgrade, potentially cementing its role as a frontrunner in decentralized applications. At the same time, XRP price is working to recover its strength amid wider market challenges, supported by Ripple’s efforts in international payment systems. On the other side, BlockDAG (BDAG) distinguishes itself with its community-centric focus and open financial practices. With a thriving presale and dynamic reward systems like the Refer & Earn feature, BlockDAG not only offers value but also builds trust and community involvement in its expanding network. BlockDAG’s Presale Achievements and USDT Bonuses through Referrals BlockDAG’s presale has notably achieved $174 million in funding across 26 batches. Currently priced at $0.0234, it has attracted global attention from the crypto community. Beyond financial achievements, BlockDAG prioritizes rewarding its community through initiatives like the Refer & Earn USDT program. This effort ensures that active community members receive direct rewards for their contributions. A key highlight of this system is the immediate cashback feature. Notably, both those who refer and those who buy gain equally, each receiving a 6% cashback in USDT (BEP-20) for every qualified transaction. Additionally, rewards are promptly credited post-purchase, which removes any wait or complex procedures, thereby boosting transparency and participation in BlockDAG. The system’s increasing cashback scale for referrers also enhances its attractiveness. For example, cashback begins at 6% for the first purchase through a referral link within a 24-hour window and increases to 7% for the second, 8% for the third, culminating at 10% from the fifth transaction onwards. Meanwhile, purchasers consistently receive a 6% cashback, preserving a fair and balanced approach. Thus, this framework not only benefits community members but also encourages them to promote BlockDAG, fostering growth while ensuring direct benefits for participants. By merging immediate benefits with the chance for greater rewards, BlockDAG shows its dedication to nurturing a dynamic and engaged community. What’s the Upcoming Ethereum Upgrade in 2025? The next major step for Ethereum is the Pectra upgrade planned for 2025, designed to transform how the network handles transactions. This upgrade will implement cutting-edge sharding methods and improve transaction processing, significantly boosting its ability to manage thousands of transactions per second. This enhancement is critical for Ethereum’s role as a primary platform for decentralized applications (dApps) and broader organizational use. Additionally, Ethereum’s shift to a proof-of-stake (PoS) model has already lessened its energy use and promoted staking, increasing its attractiveness. Pectra will further tackle issues like network congestion and high transaction fees, which have been persistent obstacles for users. With these improvements, experts predict Ethereum could reach unprecedented price levels by 2025. XRP Price Drops Amid Economic Fluctuations Recently, XRP has seen a price drop of nearly 20%, influenced by broader economic factors, such as aggressive monetary policies from the Federal Reserve and a strong U.S. dollar. Yet, the long-term outlook for XRP remains positive, with expert projections suggesting a potential rise to $2.56 by the end of 2024 and possibly $4 to $5 by 2029. Ripple’s efforts to transform international payments and the expected regulatory developments are likely to drive these optimistic forecasts. Still, the market’s inherent instability urges a careful approach to XRP. The future success of XRP will rely on Ripple’s strategic ability to overcome these economic challenges and capitalize on its payment technology innovations, reflecting the overall maturity of the cryptocurrency market. Final Verdict! The trajectory of cryptocurrencies will likely hinge on projects that integrate cutting-edge technology with active community involvement and pragmatic solutions. The Ethereum Upgrade is geared towards resolving scalability issues, while XRP aims to enhance the efficiency of international payments amidst economic hurdles. However, BlockDAG adopts a distinct path by engaging its community with clear reward initiatives and a tiered cashback system. This approach builds trust and promotes wider engagement, establishing a benchmark for inclusivity.

Coins like MEW and Popcat have already proven that feline-themed cryptos are no joke: MEW climbed an impressive 103.7% in just three months. Popcat leapt to fame with a 157.44% surge. Now, Catzilla is set to take this momentum to unprecedented heights, challenging not just meme coins but the entire market. Forget barking trends — Catzilla’s roar is the sound of future profits. The clock is ticking and the competition is scrambling. With its unique mission, presale, and the proven success of feline-themed coins, Catzilla is primed to wreck the market.

38361446,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=376797,1735683994,ai16z Explores AI-Focused L1 Blockchain as Token Hits $1.8B Market Cap,"Artificial intelligence platform ai16z is contemplating launching a layer-1 (L1) blockchain network as part of a strategic overhaul of its tokenomics model. The proposed blockchain would position its native AI16Z token as the base currency for an interconnected ecosystem centered on artificial intelligence. The Proposal A governance forum post shows that the AI platform is exploring the development of a project similar to Pump.fun to facilitate the launch of AI agents. Additionally, the team is considering positioning AI16Z as an L1 blockchain tailored for artificial intelligence applications. Participants in the discussion view the proposed launchpad as a key mechanism to implement “flywheel” tokenomics to increase the value of AI16Z. They proposed several approaches to achieve the goal, including taking a percentage of launch fees, requiring AI16Z holdings for allocation, leveraging the token for initial agent offerings, and pairing agent tokens with it in liquidity pools. Moreover, developers and projects would receive ecosystem funds, revenue-sharing opportunities, third-party launchpad support, and AI16Z’s inherent value. Additionally, buyback and burn strategies funded by platform fees are under consideration to accrue value to the token. To ensure quality and alignment with ecosystem goals, the team is also contemplating a community-driven “curation” process, where supporters would vet projects before launching through mechanisms such as staking and slashing. The post emphasized that the main goal is to create an interconnected ecosystem where various products contribute to one another’s value, all intrinsically tied to the AI16Z token. AI16Z Token’s Rapid Growth AI16Z identifies itself as “the first investment DAO led by AI agents,” leveraging its flagship AI operating system, Eliza, to combine artificial and collective intelligence in making investment decisions. According to CoinGecko data , the token’s market cap has surged past the $1.8 billion mark. At the time of writing, it was trading at $1.69 after earlier hitting a new all-time high (ATH) of $1.77. While about 5.7% below the ATH, its current price is still a massive 380% improvement in the past month. Further, a report by VanEck showed the Web3 ecosystem now hosts approximately 10,000 AI agents, collectively generating millions of dollars in weekly earnings through on-chain activities. The asset manager projects that blockchain networks’ AI agent population could surpass 1 million by the end of 2025. Additionally, recent insights from the Web3 analytics platform Dexu AI reveal that AI-driven technologies, led by AI16Z, generated an impressive 72.2% return over the past month. Previously, the cryptocurrency was one of the poor performers among tokens launched on Binance Alpha, dropping 18.5% of its value before rediscovering its footing. Its uptick may not come as a surprise, with Bitfinex recently hinting that such tokens could change the crypto space as more people use them to execute transactions, optimize their investment strategies, and manage their crypto wallets.

Musk AI King (MUSKAI), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKAI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk AI King can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk AI King could become the next viral memecoin. Musk AI King launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk AI King on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk AI King by entering its contract address – 8hfjjhqWbfVZsqxCKVQu115AXUzUPTHZFXZwk81rYTMw – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKAI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/new-solana-memecoin-musk-ai-king-muskai-will-skyrocket-16000-ahead-of-first-exchange-listing-while-dogecoin-wif-and-bonk-underperform/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png
38361570,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53555,1735683340,Expert Projects XRP Price Once Ripple vs. SEC Lawsuit Is Resolved,"Market analysts and commentators are closely monitoring the potential impact of the ongoing Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit on XRP’s value. As the case progresses, speculation is mounting about how its resolution could influence the token’s future price, with some projecting significant gains. Ripple vs. SEC: Case Developments The legal battle between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been a defining factor for XRP since the lawsuit was initiated in December 2020. A pivotal moment occurred on July 13, 2023, when Judge Analisa Torres ruled that XRP is not a security, marking a significant regulatory milestone. This ruling temporarily boosted the token’s market value, although uncertainties lingered. Subsequently, a final judgment was issued in August 2024. However, the SEC filed an appeal on October 17, contesting parts of the earlier decision. According to court schedules, the SEC must submit its opening brief by January 15, 2025, keeping the case in the spotlight. Some observers speculate that the potential appointment of Paul Atkins, a nominee of President-elect Donald Trump as SEC Chair could expedite a resolution. If such a scenario unfolds, the conclusion of the case could have a profound effect on the token’s price trajectory. XRP Price Predictions and Analysis Prominent XRP supporter Digital Asset Investor (DAI) recently explored potential outcomes for XRP’s value post-litigation. Consulting an AI tool, DAI examined historical price patterns linked to the lawsuit’s developments. When the SEC filed charges in December 2020, XRP’s value dropped sharply from $0.50 to $0.17—a 66% decline. Based on this precedent, the AI model suggested a favorable resolution could trigger an equivalent upward move. Given the token’s current price of approximately $2.07, such an increase could push its value to $3.44. DAI emphasized that the case’s conclusion could catalyze renewed investor interest, potentially driving further gains. However, the AI model cautioned that other variables, including market sentiment, broader regulatory trends, and Ripple’s operational progress, could also play a role in shaping the token’s performance. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Broader Market Perspectives Other analysts have presented more ambitious forecasts for the asset. In October, EGRAG Crypto proposed that the asset could reach a worst-case scenario price of $6 during the current bull market. Similarly, Alex Clay has suggested it might eventually climb to $10 if favorable conditions align. These projections highlight the significant attention the token continues to receive, not only as a digital asset but also as a key player in regulatory discussions shaping the cryptocurrency market. As the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit moves into its appeal phase, market participants remain optimistic about its potential. While no exact timeline for the case’s resolution exists, its outcome is expected to have a considerable impact on the asset’s value. Whether through regulatory clarity, increased adoption, or improved market sentiment, the token’s future hinges on legal and market developments in the coming months.

38361064,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/why-pepe-jumped-20-today-and-which-coin-could-be-next,1735683143,Why $PEPE Jumped 20% Today and Which Coin Could Be Next,"Today, the crypto world is excited as $PEPE, a popular memecoin, jumped by 20%. The reason? Elon Musk. Earlier today, Musk changed his profile picture on Twitter (now X) to an image of Pepe the Frog, a famous internet meme linked to $PEPE. This small action got huge attention and pushed the $PEPE price up quickly. This shows how big names like Elon Musk can influence the crypto market. The sudden price spike has many people asking if this is the start of a new altcoin season. Let’s see what this could mean and which coin might rise next. Is Altcoin Season Starting? Altcoin season is when altcoins (cryptos other than Bitcoin) perform better than Bitcoin. Memecoins like $PEPE often signal the start of such a season. When a memecoin skyrockets, it means more people are jumping into the market, which could lead to other altcoins rising too.Elon Musk’s effect on $PEPE’s price might lead to similar moves in other coins. With more money and interest flowing into the market, other altcoins might soon follow the bullish trend. What Coin Could Rise Next? While $PEPE is in the spotlight now, another coin showing potential is Altura ($ALU). Altura is a blockchain platform leveraging AI technology to revolutionize various industries, especially gaming and digital ownership. Here’s why Altura could be the next big winner. Altura’s Price and Future Potential Altura’s price has been steady recently, but trading volume and interest are growing. The project stands out for integrating AI solutions to enhance user experiences and optimize digital asset management. This forward-thinking approach is gaining traction, making Altura a strong candidate for significant growth. The coin’s price is building a solid base, and experts say it could break resistance levels soon. If it does, $ALU could see a big price jump, possibly over 50% in the near future. Why Altura Stands Out 1. AI Integration: Altura uses AI to create smarter and more efficient solutions, appealing to a wide range of users and developers.2. Innovative Applications: Its AI-powered tools are transforming industries like gaming and digital ownership.3. Market Interest: As people look for the next big opportunity after $PEPE, Altura’s cutting-edge technology makes it a strong contender. Final Thoughts $PEPE’s massive rise today shows how fast the crypto market can react to news and trends. It could also be a sign of more opportunities in altcoins. As attention shifts, Altura($ALU) is one coin that stands out with its innovative use of AI and growing popularity.If you’re exploring altcoin opportunities, keep an eye on Altura. With its focus on AI-driven solutions, it might be the next big winner after $PEPE. Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial advice.

Recent data reveals that the platform holds an impressive balance exceeding 1.8 billion XRP, a milestone that underscores its strong position in the cryptocurrency market. This announcement has drawn attention across the crypto space, as Uphold’s XRP balance amounts to 1,859,132,752.296861 XRP. This substantial reserve is second only to Ripple. Significance for Token Holders Uphold’s position as the second-largest XRP holder carries implications for the broader community. It signals the company’s confidence in the long-term potential of the digital asset. Uphold’s commitment to maintaining such a significant reserve demonstrates its alignment with the principles of transparency and security that are critical in the digital asset space. Furthermore, the move is likely to enhance trust among token holders who use Uphold’s platform for trading and asset management. Broader Implications The announcement also highlights a broader trend within the cryptocurrency market: the growing institutional adoption of XRP. With platforms securing large reserves, the asset continues to attract interest as a utility-driven cryptocurrency. Ripple’s ongoing partnerships with financial institutions and the expanding use of the token for remittance services have contributed to its strong market presence. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 However, Uphold’s large holding may also spark discussions about centralization within the XRP ecosystem. Critics might argue that substantial reserves concentrated in a few entities, such as Ripple and Uphold, could pose risks of market manipulation. Nonetheless, Uphold’s decision to disclose its holdings sets a positive precedent for transparency, which could encourage other major holders to follow suit. Role in the Crypto Space As a platform that supports multiple cryptocurrencies, Uphold has established itself as a trusted exchange and wallet provider. Its ability to manage a large XRP reserve demonstrates its operational efficiency and strategic foresight. The move reinforces its position as a key stakeholder in the cryptocurrency market. This development also comes at a time when the asset remains under significant scrutiny due to ongoing regulatory challenges in the U.S. The SEC lawsuit against Ripple has raised questions about the native token’s classification as a security. Uphold’s large holding, despite these challenges, indicates its confidence in the cryptocurrency’s potential beyond legal uncertainties.

As the memecoin continues to capture headlines and spark discussions across platforms, its potential for explosive growth remains a focal point in the altcoin community. With the Dogecoin price fluctuating and historical patterns suggesting another significant rally is on the horizon, investors are keenly observing not just DOGE but also emerging altcoins that might replicate its past successes. One such altcoin, RCO Finance (RCOF) , is generating buzz as it prepares to rival the memecoin giant, aiming to replicate its 2021 golden move. Whale Moves and Buy Signals: Is Dogecoin Price Gearing Up for a Comeback? The Dogecoin price has been in the spotlight recently as technical indicators and whale activity signal a potential rebound. The TD Sequential indicator on the 4-hour chart has flashed a buy signal, hinting at a possible reversal in the downward trend. With the Dogecoin price ticking slightly to $0.31556 (+1.00%), the shift from red to green candles suggests selling pressure might be easing, paving the way for short-term upward momentum. Adding to the optimism, whale activity has surged, with large investors accumulating over 90 million DOGE in the past 48 hours. Despite recent declines, this buying spree reflects growing confidence among whales about the potential for a market recovery for the Dogecoin price. Complementing these developments, technical indicators like Bollinger Bands suggest oversold conditions, while the MACD shows weakening bearish momentum, raising the prospect of a bullish crossover. These factors collectively point to an intriguing phase for the Dogecoin price as traders watch for signs of a sustained rally. The Mechanics Behind RCO Finance’s Potential 2021 Dogecoin Rally RCO Finance (RCOF) is an emerging prospect in the altcoin market, poised to replicate the explosive growth of the Dogecoin price in 2021.

According to data, the cumulative revenue realized in 2024 hit $2.12 billion. This figure represents a remarkable 115.73% increase compared to Tron’s 2023 performance level. Steady Growth and Market Milestones Data from Lookonchain also shows a spike in revenue generated in December alone. The revenue grew by approximately 40% as Tron’s network recorded $329.57 million within 30 days. This highlights the asset’s steady growth in the course of the outgoing year. In 2024, Tron’s token hit an all-time high (ATH) of $0.45 after it leaped from lows of $0.22 to surpass its previous price levels. Notably, TRX had its last ATH in January of 2018. However, the recent bull rally pushed the momentum for the cryptocurrency. Market experts attributed the surge to the bullish trend dubbed the “altcoin season.” During this period, other cryptocurrencies flip Bitcoin in performance. It is this overall positive sentiment of the altcoin trend that TRX benefitted from to take it to peak levels. Tron Metric Signals Investors’ Confidence DeFiLlama data reveals that the Total Value Locked for Tron has reached $7.47 billion. This highlights the level of confidence investors have in Tron. However, regarding fees, Tron lags and does not make the top ten protocols. Tron occupies the 11th position on the revenue leaderboard behind other assets like Ethereum, Lido, and Solana. As of this writing, TRX is trading at $0.2563, a 2.25% increase in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data . However, The market volume has dropped to $779.33 million, an 8.45% decline. However, Tron’s market capitalization of $22.09 billion helped position it among the top crypto assets in the crypto space. Justin Sun’s Vision for 2025 Meanwhile, earlier in December, Justin Sun, Tron’s founder, made a bold statement that could suggest the future direction of the asset . According to Sun, Tron will reposition in 2025 to leverage on the anticipated shift in the cryptocurrency landscape after President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration. Some of Trump’s nominees suggest the administration might favorably lean towards crypto. Although Sun referenced the business intelligence firm, MicroStrategy, it remains uncertain the direction he plans to take the cryptocurrency.

Moreover, analysts predict the value of Ethereum (ETH) might rise to $5k. Shiba Inu burn rate drops, bullish signal appears According to data from Shibburn, there has been a massive drop in the amount of SHIB coins burned by the community. Over the past seven days, the burn rate has declined by 74%. The drop in this metric shows declining interest from investors. On the other hand, the Shiba Inu price has declined by 5.24% on the weekly chart and 31.11% on the monthly level. In terms of price movement, the value of the Shiba Inu token is consolidating between $0.000021 and $0.000024 on the weekly timeframe. Nevertheless, analysts like Ali Martinez believe a rally is coming. The analyst told his followers the TD Sequential indicator has presented a buy signal on the Shiba Inu price chart. He expects the value of the cryptocurrency to rise to $0.000026 or even $0.000029 in the coming weeks. Ethereum expected to hit $5k in 2025 One of the top analysts, Lucky, has forecasted that the value of Ethereum will increase significantly within this cycle. The Ethereum coin price, he expects, will hit a $5,000 target. In another tweet, a trader called CROW notes the Ethereum price might rally to $4,800 soon. Presently, d a ta reveals the value of the Ethereum token has dropped by 1.4% on the weekly timeframe. Nevertheless, investors remain optimistic. Ethereum is trading above the 50-SMA ($3,439.59) and 200-SMA ($3,012.00) which is a bullish sign. Additionally, the relative strength index is rising towards the midline, a sign that bulls are active.

Data released on Dec. 30 revealed that December marked the highest monthly trading volume for DEXs, continuing the momentum from November. In November, the DeFi space recorded a volume of $374 billion, spurred by optimism surrounding a potential crypto-friendly regulatory regime in the United States after Donald Trump’s presidential election victory. Top DEXs by Trading Volume Uniswap remained the top decentralized exchange by volume, recording $106.4 billion over the past 30 days, according to DefiLlama. PancakeSwap followed with $96.4 billion in trading volume for the month. Solana’s largest DEX, Raydium, claimed third place, registering $58 billion in monthly volume. This surge coincided with an increase in Solana-based decentralized application (DApp) revenue. On Dec. 17, research platform Syndica reported that Solana DApps generated $365 million in revenue during November, largely fueled by memecoins launched on the Solana platform Pump.fun. Aerodrome and Orca took the fourth and fifth spots, with volumes of $31 billion and $22 billion, respectively. Lifinity, Curve Finance, and Hyperliquid collectively recorded $43.6 billion in trading volume. Memecoin Market Declines Despite Early Surge While DeFi trading volumes climbed, the memecoin market faced a significant correction in December. CoinMarketCap data showed that the memecoin market cap peaked at $137 billion on Dec. 9 but dropped sharply to $92 billion by Dec. 23. At the time of writing, the total market cap for memecoins stood at $95 billion, reflecting a 20% decline since Dec. 1.

38361568,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53551,1735681962,707 Million Cardano (ADA) Amid Price Recovery. Here’s what happened,"Cardano (ADA) has witnessed a significant increase in Open Interest (OI), reaching peak levels as its price experiences a slight rebound. Recent data from CoinGlass indicates growing activity among investors and traders, supported by broader market factors such as increased interest from market whales. Cardano Open Interest Reaches $629 Million Cardano’s Open Interest has climbed to 707.38 million ADA, equivalent to $629.47 million, reflecting a 1.79% rise in the last 24 hours. While this is a modest increase, it highlights a renewed focus on ADA by market participants. The uptick in OI aligns with increased trading activity on key cryptocurrency exchanges. Bybit and Binance have led the surge, recording $218.78 million and $213.10 million in Open Interest, respectively. Together, these two exchanges accounted for 68.6% of total trading activity in ADA. Meanwhile, other platforms such as Bitget, OKX, and BingX contributed significant volumes, with Open Interest figures of $83.78 million, $47.74 million, and $29.04 million, respectively. These three exchanges collectively accounted for an additional 25.5% of Cardano’s Open Interest activity. Market Reaction and Trading Volume Surge The recent activity in Open Interest has coincided with ADA’s slight price recovery. At the time of reporting, Cardano is trading at $0.8785, marking a 1.85% price increase in the last 24 hours. Additionally, its trading volume has surged by 14.94%, reaching $891.67 million as more investors show interest in the asset. This renewed activity suggests that traders and investors are reentering the ADA market, possibly drawn by the recent price retracement and the potential for future gains.

Market analysts believe the surge in Open Interest could support Cardano in breaking the $1 price threshold if momentum continues. The asset’s growing trading volume is also seen as a positive indicator of increasing market engagement. However, some challenges remain. ADA presents a significant resistance level that could hinder Cardano’s recovery trajectory. This obstacle has tempered analysts’ optimism, leading to cautious predictions about ADA’s ability to achieve sustained price growth beyond $1. Cardano’s recent Open Interest surge reflects a resurgence of market interest, driven by growing trading activity on major exchanges and increasing investor participation. While the asset shows promise for further recovery, substantial resistance levels highlight the importance of sustained momentum to achieve new price milestones.

38361567,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53548,1735681679,67 Trillion SHIB Level About to Disappear. Here’s the Significance,"Shiba Inu is approaching a significant turning point as critical support at the 67 trillion SHIB level comes under intense pressure. Recent market trends and on-chain metrics reveal growing challenges for the asset, which could have far-reaching implications for its trajectory. Support Levels Under Threat The digital asset’s price movements indicate a struggle to maintain key support zones. After failing to hold above the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a crucial technical level for maintaining bullish momentum, SHIB initially dipped to $0.0000222 but currently trades at 0.00002292. The 200-day EMA, which often serves as the final line of defense for bullish traders, is now just above SHIB’s current trading range. Losing this level would likely trigger a more pronounced decline, with potential targets around $0.0000204 or even lower. Declining On-Chain Activity On-chain data further highlights the asset’s vulnerability. A sharp reduction in large transaction volumes suggests waning interest from institutional investors and whales, key participants in sustaining market activity and stability. Additionally, profitability metrics show that most SHIB holders are currently in a losing position, which could exacerbate bearish sentiment and fuel further selling pressure. If the token breaches the 200 EMA, the psychological and technical significance of the 67 trillion SHIB support level could erode. Breaking this threshold may trigger panic selling, amplifying downward momentum. The lack of strong buying interest at current levels compounds the risk of sustained price declines. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Opportunities for Recovery Despite the bearish outlook, there are potential opportunities for a rebound. Technical indicators, such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) , suggest that the token may soon enter oversold territory, a condition that could attract speculative buyers seeking a short-term recovery. If a bounce occurs, the asset would first face resistance at the 50 EMA around $0.0000250, followed by a stronger barrier near $0.0000300. For a recovery to materialize, the token would need renewed buying interest to stabilize its price and rebuild momentum. Monitoring trading volume and investor activity will be crucial for identifying any signs of a shift in sentiment. The digital asset is at an important stage, with its ability to maintain the 67 trillion SHIB level being critical for its near-term performance. The interplay between technical indicators and on-chain activity will determine whether the asset can recover or face deeper losses. Investors should remain vigilant, tracking key support levels and market conditions to assess the next phase of the token’s journey.

38360455,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=635526,1735681213,“I won’t be derailed”: Charles Hoskinson lays out final mission for Cardano,"Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, says he is closing out a decade-long journey by sticking to what he does best: laying it all on the table. As the blockchain ecosystem enters what he calls the Age of Voltaire, Charles has made one thing clear: nothing—no one—is going to derail his plan to hand Cardano’s future to its community. “For those who know me well, this statement is nothing new,” Charles said , addressing both his supporters and critics. “I’ve spent ten years of my life on Cardano. Many mistakes were made, but I never crossed lines for a cash grab from the community or deviated from the original roadmap.” He’s digging in his heels for 2025, a year that will decide if Cardano can fully transition to a decentralized governance model. The final steps involve getting the blockchain’s budget and constitution approved—no small feat in a space where critics and competitors are quick to pounce. Charles has no plans to give up. “My last duty is to remove any roadblock for this transition. There is no way in hell anyone or anything is going to derail that process.” A decade of updates: How Cardano got here The platform has been grinding through years of updates, building out a blockchain that can scale, handle smart contracts, and—if you ask Charles—compete with the big dogs like Bitcoin and Ethereum. In 2024, the project reached some major milestones. First, there’s Plutus, Cardano’s smart contract platform. Plutus V2 launched in September 2022 with features like inline datum and reference inputs, but 2024 was the real game-changer. By August, Plutus V3 hit the scene, giving developers even more tools to build decentralized applications (DApps). As of press time, Cardano had about 105,500 smart contracts deployed. Compare that to just 8,083 at the start of the year, and it’s clear the upgrades worked. Then there’s Midnight, a new protocol aimed at making privacy a reality for Cardano users. Announced in late 2024, it’s designed to use zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to unlock around $20 trillion in crypto assets currently out of reach due to regulatory barriers. Midnight is also about giving developers and users tools to keep their data secure. If it works, it could be one of Cardano’s biggest selling points. The Chang hard fork also landed in 2024, rocking Cardano’s governance model. This update let the community take the wheel, introducing Delegate Representatives (DReps) to handle voting on proposals. And let’s not forget Hydra, the layer-2 scaling solution. It’s been in development all year, promising to make Cardano faster and less congested. Hydra allows the network to process transactions simultaneously across multiple layers, which is very important as more DApps join the ecosystem. Charles faces critics and a changing market While Cardano has been busy updating its tech, Charles has had to fend off a steady stream of criticism. Some of it comes from outside the community—critics love to call Cardano overvalued, especially compared to its actual usage. A Forbes article even labeled ADA, Cardano’s native token, a “zombie crypto,” pointing to its $40 billion market cap despite relatively few functional applications. The internal drama hasn’t let up either. In November, a user on X (formerly Twitter) called Charles “the cancer of Cardano,” a comment that quickly went viral. While many in the community defended him, a poll later revealed that 43% of respondents were dissatisfied with his leadership. That’s a pretty big chunk of the user base. And then there’s the market itself. ADA’s price has been all over the place. It dropped to $0.34 after an $18 million token unlock flooded the market, but it managed to climb back up to $0.85 by the end of December. Meanwhile, Cardano’s total value locked (TVL) in decentralized finance (DeFi) fell from $700 million to $478 million over the course of the year.

Homosexual Pepe (HOMOPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HOMOPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Homosexual Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homosexual Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Homosexual Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homosexual Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homosexual Pepe by entering its contract address – 92xPeBxtanptFH9AYsRtwRMq7cWWw9GHfxaspwpNvCTP – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMOPEPE.

Despite this setback, an analyst predicts an even bleaker outlook for the leading cryptocurrency. The formation of a bearish flag pattern suggests further price declines could be on the horizon, with the analyst projecting a steeper price plunge towards $90,000. Bearish Flag Pattern Signal Bitcoin Price Crash Pejman Zwin, a TradingView crypto analyst, released a chart analysis predicting a significantly bearish outlook for the Bitcoin price. The analyst based this gloomy forecast on the appearance of a bearish flag pattern and other key technical indicators. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Guns For A Mid-High Timeframe Reversal Against Bitcoin In Bullish Q1 2025 According to Zwin, Bitcoin is moving within a bearish flag pattern, a technical formation that often signals a continuation of a prior downtrend. If this flag pattern holds, Bitcoin is likely preparing to break downward, which could lead to severe price declines. The analyst indicated that the 50-day Moving Average (MA), around the $95,974 mark, acted as a key resistance or support level for Bitcoin. However, the cryptocurrency recently broke below this MA — a development considered bearish, suggesting further downside. Zwin also disclosed that Bitcoin is moving within a heavy support zone between $95,000 and $90,870. Additionally, he highlighted that the pioneer cryptocurrency is breaking through key support lines, signaling a potential continuation of the downward trend. Looking at Bitcoin’s price action relative to the aforementioned technical indicators and chart patterns, Zwin anticipates a significant price crash toward $91,000. The analyst highlighted that a decline to $91,000 was the minimum expected, which would occur if Bitcoin breaks current support lines. He also disclosed that if the heavy support zone is breached, BTC could face further bearish pressure, potentially revisiting lower price levels around $90,540. Interestingly, Zwin’s bearish Bitcoin price prediction follows a recent price crash to $91,000 on Monday. During this sideways trading Bitcoin’s market sentiment has declined, with its bearish price action showing no signs of slowing down. Although Bitcoin’s price suffered a sharp fall, it has quickly recovered and is now trading at $93,893. Nevertheless, a price drop to Zwin’s projected $90,540 target would result in a Bitcoin crash of approximately 3.6% Alternative Bullish Scenario While he projected a bearish outlook for the Bitcoin price, Zwin provided an alternative bullish scenario that could trigger a rebound. According to the TradingView analyst, around $95,974 could be a ceiling for Bitcoin’s price. If BTC can break above the resistance lines, it could invalidate the bearish flag pattern, signaling a potential reversal to the upside.

38360516,https://blockworks.co/news/solana-swap-app-costly-sandwich-attacks,1735680600,This Solana swap app is trying to make sandwich attacks more costly,"This is a segment from the Lightspeed newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . Earlier this year, Solana’s network congestion created a lot of concern over traders’ ability to land transactions onchain. Today, traders have a much easier time landing trades, but the concern has refocused on the prices they get while doing so. Widespread sandwich attacks , whereby sophisticated traders exploit price spreads at the expense of unsophisticated traders, have proven to be a long-running and tricky-to-solve issue. The Solana swap app and market infrastructure firm DFlow put an interesting new solution on the table when it proposed conditional liquidity, which tasks new market intermediaries with separating toxic from non-toxic order flow. When a DEX trader tries to swap one cryptocurrency for another, they are quoted a price and allowed to set slippage, which is the percentage that the quoted price can change after the order is submitted. Solana sandwich attackers exploit slippage by front-running transactions to artificially raise the price a few basis points before selling the asset right after at a profit — leaving the user with a worse price. In the aggregate, sandwich attackers can make millions per day . DFlow proposes adding a new class of market participants called segmenters to divide toxic from non-toxic order flow and limit sandwich attacking. Segmenters, which will initially be chosen by DFlow, sit between users who submit the transactions and the DEXs that receive them, and basically sort good from bad transactions. When DEXs receive these labeled transactions, they can then charge higher fees to sandwichers and lower fees to everyone else. Conditional liquidity “doesn’t completely solve sandwiching” but can reduce it by charging different rates, DFlow founder Nitesh Nath said. “The magnitude of sandwich reduction is proportional to the difference in the higher rate for toxic flow and the lower rate for non-toxic flow.” DFlow already launched a segmenter called DFlow Aggregator and a conditional liquidity DEX called Clearpool. Segmenters are meant to create a marketplace for order flow, where the better the prices segmenters achieve for users, the more order flow DEXs and wallets send them. Segmenters make money by collecting some of the price improvement they provide. “Conditional liquidity aligns the interests of retail traders, DEXs and the network — a win-win-win for all parties involved. We expect conditional liquidity to be one of the big breakout trends of 2025,” JR Reed, partner at DFlow investor Multicoin Capital, said. Chris Chung, CEO of the Solana swap app Titan, said he believes conditional liquidity could give honest traders better prices, but it could be hard to get DEXs to start accepting the new market structure. DEXs would only start altering their fees if there was sufficient demand for conditional liquidity from the venues where traders are placing orders, but those venues will also want to see DEXs integrate the feature first. “It becomes a chicken and [egg] problem,” Chung said in a text, adding that the demand question may be partly why DFlow launched its own segmenter and DEX.

38359621,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=635514,1735679404,Vitalik Buterin tells Elon Musk to stop banning people who don’t agree with him on X,"Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin has called out Elon Musk, telling the X owner to back off with the account suspensions. In a polite yet scathing response to the handling of dissent on X, the blockchain genius made it clear he’s not impressed with the liberal use of the “banhammer” to silence voices that don’t align with Elon’s views. Vitalik warned that such actions are dangerous for public discourse and could lead to chaos rather than constructive dialogue. The critique came after Elon’s aggressive reaction to a user accusing him of trying to “optimize something that shouldn’t exist,” in regards to the H-1B visa program. The eccentric billionaire lashed out, tweeting, “Take a big step back and FUCK YOURSELF in the face. I will go to war on this issue the likes of which you cannot possibly comprehend,” an escalation that instantly got him a lot of backlash. Vitalik warns of the dangers of censorship In his response, Vitalik pointed out that free speech is easy to support when you agree with the message but much harder when the opinions are tough to swallow. “Respecting free speech is easy when we agree with the speech, and hard when we think it’s awful,” he said. The Ether founder warned Elon that wielding the banhammer to control discourse today only paves the way for others to use it tomorrow. “The banhammer is controlled by one group today, it will be controlled by another group tomorrow, and every use of it legitimizes further use,” Vitalik explained. His argument centered on the idea that suppressing speech leads to either fractured conversations, a dominant monoculture, or constant hostility among opposing factions. Vitalik said: “I feel like a lot of people have been okay with rising aggressiveness because the target of the aggressiveness was one faction that they disliked, but once that beast is summoned, its nature is to look for new targets, and even if you approve of the first target you may not approve of the second or the third or the fourth – as many people have been finding out this week.” Vitalik also took aim at the aggressive tone of online discussions, something he says has worsened over the past few years. He emphasized that leaders like Elon play a critical role in setting the tone for these conversations. “It’s not ‘wartime mode’ that will get humanity to Mars in one piece; it’s something brighter,” he said, calling for a change in attitude and approach. That’s just Vitalik. In a surprising jab at Elon, he actually said, “This isn’t the kind of memetic beast we want running the show when we’re entering an era of dangerous global political competition and rapidly improving AI. The role of leaders in setting the tone is really important, and can be used to great good or great evil.” Elon’s H-1B visa battle Elon Musk has never backed down from sharing his opinions, and his recent defense of the H-1B visa program is no exception. The visa, which allows U.S. companies to hire skilled foreign workers, has been a cornerstone for his companies, Tesla and SpaceX. In 2024 alone, Tesla secured 724 H-1B visas, highlighting how essential the program is for filling key roles. Elon himself immigrated to the U.S. from South Africa and became a citizen in 2002. He credits the H-1B program and skilled immigration for much of America’s technological success, saying , “The reason I’m in America along with so many critical people who built SpaceX, Tesla, and hundreds of other companies… is because of H-1B.” Accusations of censorship pile up Elon is also under fire for allegedly silencing conservative accounts on X. Reports indicate that at least 14 right-wing accounts lost their verification badges after criticizing Elon’s stance on immigration. Losing verification not only affects credibility but also hits visibility and monetization on the platform, making it a serious issue for content creators. Critics say Elon is using his power to squash dissenting voices, something that feels hypocritical for a self-proclaimed free-speech absolutist. Elon fired back, labeling his detractors as “hateful racists” and “contemptible fools.” He argued that these critics are harming the Republican Party with their extreme rhetoric. This internal rift within the MAGA movement proves the growing tension over immigration policy. Elon, who supports legal immigration but opposes illegal immigration, finds himself in the crossfire of an ideological battle that refuses to die down. And what’s more, Trump actually took his side on the matter. Enter “Kekius Maximus” In typical Elon fashion, he added fuel to the fire by changing his display name on X to “Kekius Maximus.” This peculiar moniker combines internet meme culture with Roman grandeur, referencing both Pepe the Frog and Maximus Decimus Meridius, the legendary character from Gladiator . Pepe the Frog, once an innocent meme, has been co-opted by various online subcultures, some of which have links to extremism. But Elon is using it in a tongue-in-cheek manner, leaning into the absurdity of internet culture. The name change coincided with a surge in a memecoin called KEKIUS, which saw its value skyrocket by 500% within hours. As of press time, KEKIUS was trading at $0.005667, with trading volumes surging fast.

38359478,https://zycrypto.com/?p=99616,1735679336,"XRP Road to $10 Price: Gensler Exit, Trump’s Win, and ETF Buzz Fuel Hopes","Ripple’s XRP continues to mesmerize the crypto market, reaching $2.48, its highest level since 2018. This rise, from an increase of roughly 399% in the period of a month, indicates that there is more and more speculation and confidence in the increase in demand for Ripple’s main token. This has led to a discussion on forums and social media of whether the altcoin is ready to reach for the stars and if a $10 XRP could soon become a reality. Trump’s Pro-Crypto Victory Sparks a Bullish Surge Twists from the external environment, including president-elect Donald Trump and his encouraging sentiments towards virtual currencies, have boosted the rally of XRP. The recent victory in the general election has brought hope among cryptocurrency investors, as most believe the new government will favor digital currencies. Trump’s victory sparked a 42% jump in the overall crypto market, propelling XRP to $2.48. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has been especially vocal about Trump and his administration, stating that Trump will “make crypto great again” and, by extension, the markets will do so as well. Robinhood Relists XRP, Igniting Retail Trading Frenzy Robinhood decided to reinstate cryptocurrency on its platform after it had been banned in early 2020 due to the SEC case against Ripple. The relisting sparked renewed interest in XRP particularly to the retail traders, thus the trading escalated. This is why trading volume on new applications such as Robinhood and Coinbase surged and caused the XRP price to rise. Many of these have opened their doors to XRP in recent days, helping foster consumer interest in the coin. Gensler’s Departure Opens Doors for Legal Clarity The pressure from the authorities is also easing up for XRP. That is good news for Ripple as well as for XRP, which has benefited from Gensler’s resignation alongside other positive signs, including what some believe to be the final stages of the SEC lawsuit. The resignation of Gensler as the chairman of the Commission is welcome, especially if one considers his quite hostile attitude towards the industry. With the prospect of a more crypto-friendly SEC leadership, XRP investors are hopeful that Ripple will soon be able to resolve its legal issues and unlock further growth. Altcoin Season: XRP Benefits from Bitcoin’s Declining Dominance Now, as it stands, BTC market dominance has fallen from 60% to 53% within the past weeks, and XRP has gained the advantage from the growing market appetite for altcoins. This trend is known as the altcoin season, during which investors return to buying larger numbers of different cryptocurrencies, including XRP. The decline in Bitcoin’s market domination indicates that Alts are being sought after, and XRP benefited greatly from this shift. ETF Speculation Boosts XRP’s Upward Trajectory A significant part of the bullish signals in XRP is associated with the increasing expectation of XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Filing for the XRP ETFs by some key market players such as WisdomTree, 21Shares, and Canary Capital has attracted investors’ attention. In particular, investors have gotten excited about WisdomTree’s filing, and the Bank of New York Mellon has been listed as the trust’s administrator. Should the approval be granted, an XRP ETF can be considered as a real game mover, enabling institutional más investors and likely pushing up the XRP price. Record-Breaking Inflows Boost Confidence XRP recorded $95 million in inflows into investment products in the last week, the highest amount CoinShares has reported for XRP since tracking began. It has increased week over week by a massive 621% and points to increasing institutional demand. These inflows contributed to more than 35% of $270 million in total digital asset inflows in the last week, which proves the dominance of XRP. In turn, Bitcoin registered $457 million in outflows, with commentators attributing this to profit booking after the Bitcoin touched $100,000. Inflows into Ethereum this year amounted to $634 million and broke the $2.2 billion YTD mark. However, the growth of Ethereum’s input shed light on the increasing demand for XRP as the ETF debate continues and overall market interest intensifies. XRP’s Path to $10 XRP’s price surge to $2.48 is just the beginning. With $95 million in weekly inflows, bullish political changes, regulatory optimism, and the growing likelihood of XRP ETFs, the stage is set for even more upward momentum. XRP is now positioned to make a run at new all-time highs—potentially even $10. As market sentiment continues to favor Ripple, all eyes will be on the upcoming regulatory developments and ETF approvals that could make XRP a top performer in the crypto space.",POSITIVE,BTC | XRP,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/xrp-road-to-10-price-gensler-exit-trumps-win-and-etf-buzz-fuel-hopes/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

Pseudonymous analyst Dave the Wave tells 147,700 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin may remain in a technical bullish trend for a while longer before eventually going parabolic. “The simple fact is that BTC price has not gone parabolic yet. This is both a negative and a positive. A negative in that those higher prices might not come in the here and now (is this really a negative?), and a positive in that price is still technically stable with eventual higher prices at a later date, compared to if the spike had come sooner. With the number getting high fast, this served to over-excite the market. There is an element of ‘money illusion’ at work in this in my opinion. Keep in mind also that price can always turn on a dime to the upside despite the sober technicals.” Dave the Wave uses his version of logarithmic growth curves (LGCs), which aim to forecast Bitcoin’s market cycle highs and lows while filtering out short-term volatility. Source: Dave the Wave/X Looking at the trader’s chart, he suggests that LGC’s support levels may be tested around the $70,000 range while the overall bullish trend remains intact. He also says that Bitcoin is currently in a consolidation phase until it can break out of a key trendline. “BTC consolidation the order of the day until the downward diagonal can be broken. Technically, still very solid.” Source: Dave the Wave/X Bitcoin is trading for $92,338 at time of writing, down 13.2% in the last two weeks.

38359686,https://blockworks.co/news/2025-btc-adoption-wave,1735678800,Sizing up a 2025 adoption wave,"This is a segment from the Forward Guidance newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . We’ve heard the “increased adoption” answer plenty when asking industry players about 2025 crypto market expectations . Beyond retail, an array of big players particularly want in on BTC, and forecasted regulatory clarity will help fuel that shift, many believe. Though bitcoin adoption looks different for various investors, BlackRock’s guidance earlier this month gives us a sense of the buying wave that is possible. During a busy month in which Donald Trump nominated a new SEC chair and the Fed again cut rates , some might have missed the asset management giant’s December “investment perspectives” edition. A couple weeks back, BlackRock execs wrote that the so-called Magnificent 7 tech stocks (in a portfolio of 60% stocks and 40% bonds) each, on average, account for roughly the same share of overall portfolio risk as a 1-2% BTC allocation. “We think that’s a reasonable range for a bitcoin exposure,” they added. Galaxy CEO Mike Novogratz was among those who saw the guidance, reacting as follows: Slowly and then all at once… @BlackRock recommending up to a 2% Bitcoin allocation is massive. The world's largest asset manager now sees $BTC alongside tech giants like Apple and Tesla. Institutions are here. — Mike Novogratz (@novogratz) December 12, 2024 Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan noted in an X space a week or so later that the news went unnoticed by many. It was sort of funny, Hougan added — “not just that people missed BlackRock saying you should add bitcoin to a portfolio, but all of a sudden we doubled the allocation.” Hogan is alluding to the not-uncommon 1% allocation to bitcoin for those who have jumped into the space. A March survey found that of the financial advisers allocating to the space, 15% recommended to clients a 1% allocation. Of those saying they planned to allocate, 23% expected to start with a position of that size. Many investors Bitwise speaks with opt for a 5% allocation, Hougan added — a level he noted would often get you laughed at a year ago. “[It’s] not just 2% for a few people at a wealth manager; [it’s] 2% for the base rate for a portfolio across every exposure,” he noted of the BlackRock guidance. “I think it’s really significant, and if you think it’s the end of the story, you’re wrong.” While US bitcoin ETFs have helped wealth managers wade into crypto , many still haven’t. Then there are the other interested institutions, whether it be companies , governments or pension funds . Hougan said as bitcoin volatility goes down in a year or two, perhaps BlackRock will recommend a 5% allocation to BTC. BlackRock execs indeed note that wider adoption and trading could make BTC’s low correlation with equities more stable — trimming the asset’s contribution to portfolio risk and enabling investors to up their position in it. “Yet broad adoption could also mean bitcoin loses the structural catalyst for further sizable price rises,” they explain. “The case for a permanent holding may then be less clear-cut and investors may prefer to use it tactically to hedge against specific risks, similar to gold.” Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

According to X user Shaun Edmondson , the 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs trading on US exchanges hold 1,104,354 BTC after aggressive buying since their January launch. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETF holds the most coins with 521,375 BTC, more than double the assets of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. BlackRock now ranks as the third-largest Bitcoin holder. (Source: X) Data from SoSoValue shows that spot Bitcoin ETFs collectively hold $109 billion in assets, equivalent to 5.57% of Bitcoin’s market capitalization. Bitcoin ETFs Record Second-Highest Weekly Inflows Since Launch This week has boded well for spot Bitcoin ETFs, with the data so far showing that the weekly inflows are at the second-highest level since January. This comes after the products posted positive flows for six consecutive days. The total inflows to these products have already surpassed $2.35 billion so far this week. On December 5, inflows totaled $766M, with BlackRock’s IBIT posting $770M in inflows. These strong inflows coincided with a rally in BTC price above $100,000 to an all-time high of $103,670. Besides Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH) ETFs have also recorded their best week since launch after total weekly inflows surpassed $752M. Spot ETH ETFs have been under pressure from persistent outflows from the Grayscale ETF. However, for the last nine days, these products have recorded positive netflows. Inflows to spot Ethereum ETFs also hit a record high of $428M on December 5, their highest level since their launch.

In a new YouTube update, the host of InvestAnswers lays out six potential catalysts that could cause altcoins to explode in 2025. “These are the top six items that I see as being critical to triggering the so-called alt season. Now, first of all, typically what happens is you need to see a big, big, big spike in Bitcoin, and then folks take profit and rotate into alts. I will stress this again: this is what happened in the past, not sure if it’s going to happen this year. Remember, Bitcoin is a much bigger asset, takes a lot more money for it to move, and you can see the amount of buying by iBit and MicroStrategy – nearly a million Bitcoin in 11 months. It’s bonkers… It’s pretty crazy the amount of growth and the amount that these firms are sucking in. So it’s a different cycle this time, I do want to stress that. But typically, historically, if Bitcoin spiked to $150,000 there are people who would take profit and then they would load into the alts.” Beyond the movements of Bitcoin ( BTC ), the analyst says new tech and product releases could also spur an altcoin rally. “Next, we need a big new tech release, for example, Fire Dancer from Solana. We need a new ETF, and I don’t know which ETF is going to come first. A lot of chatter about the Solana ETF coming first because it is the number one crypto out there in the world, despite what other people will say. It’s where two-thirds of all transactions happen from 40,000 cryptos, so you can take that data as you want. But there could also be, with the new administration in government in the US, in-kind and staking capabilities. We just showed the power of staking on SOL strategies and running validators. Imagine if the ETF is in-kind, where you deposit your Solana, you don’t have to move to fiat first, and then you withdraw your Solana. That’ll be powerful, and then you get staking benefits.” Finally, the InvestAnswers host suggests that adoption begets adoption. “Also, we need more adoption. We need to get to 100 million daily active users to use something like Fire Dancer, and if that happens, we all succeed. The crypto market cap goes to 10 trillion pretty fast. We need regulation to support all of this, especially the alts. Right now, we don’t have that, and we need some news [to] break, like a big partnership… That’s my take, and I do believe it will happen in Q2 or Q3 2025. So we have 6 to 9 months, but remember, predicting short-term stuff is very hard. But I think summer 2025 – have your seat belts on – could be a fun time.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

38358992,https://zycrypto.com/?p=99610,1735678414,Messari Co-Founder Continues Public Feud with XRP and Cardano; Communities Fire Back,"With market caps of $119 billion and $30.52 billion, respectively, XRP and Cardano are among the top 10 cryptocurrencies globally. Yet, these prominent blockchains continue to face scrutiny over their relevance and use cases. Messari co-founder Ryan Selkis has emerged as one of their most vocal critics, reigniting hostilities with their communities in a series of provocative posts on X. “Harsh Words” for XRP and ADA Communities On December 15, Selkis targeted the XRP and Cardano communities on X (formerly Twitter), describing them as “the loudest and least valuable bot groups” in the crypto space. He challenged them to deliver real products and prove their user bases exist. “The XRP and ADA ‘communities’ are the loudest and least valuable bot groups on X. Ship something, and then I’ll respond. Where are the users?” Selkis posted. Selkis’ criticism comes as both XRP and Cardano experience increased activity. X community notes fired back with data suggesting that Cardano performed 280,000 transactions on December 12th, which is 20% to 60% of the current transaction volumes of both ETH and BTC, while interacting with only 2% to 8% of their respective market capitalizations. In the meantime, XRP remains one of the top digital assets, with Ripple stating continued expansion in payment channels operating on its digital infrastructure. Renewed Tensions with Ripple Selkis’ recent tirade also included attacks on Ripple, the company closely tied to XRP. He dismissed speculation about Ripple’s political influence after the company’s Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty was seen in a photo with presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy. Selkis criticized Ripple in a tweet filled with references to Pulp Fiction , calling XRP “a piece of shit” and labeling Ripple as “the drowning victim of crypto.” He has consistently argued that XRP’s primary purpose is to enrich insiders, a claim Ripple’s executives and community deny. Source: @twobitidiot X Cardano’s Longstanding Omission Cardano’s community has similarly been at odds with Selkis. The Messari co-founder excluded Cardano from the firm’s 2024 “Crypto Theses” report, citing insufficient economic activity. Selkis argued that blockchains without substantial usage did not merit inclusion. “It’s simple math. I find block space to be a commodity product and only covered the top ecosystems by economic activity. I omitted a TON of projects because the only chapter on Layer1s was 15 pages of a ~200 page report.Our team otherwise does excellent research on Cardano, ” Selkis wrote in December 2023. Despite this, Cardano has seen notable growth in network activity. Developers are actively building decentralized applications (dApps) and advancing its ecosystem, which includes innovative projects like Hydra , a scaling solution designed to enhance transaction throughput. XRP and Cardano Communities Push Back Selkis’ latest remarks have drawn sharp responses from XRP and Cardano supporters. Community members have cited data highlighting increasing transaction volumes and active use cases as evidence of the relevance of the blockchains. Community notes on Selkis X post While Selkis’ critiques are divisive, they reflect broader debates in the crypto industry about utility, decentralization, and long-term sustainability. The feud between the Messari co-founder and these communities appears far from over, with both sides entrenched in their positions.",NEGATIVE,ADA | BTC | XRP,ADA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | XRP,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/messari-co-founder-continues-public-feud-with-xrp-and-cardano-communities-fire-back/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

As the crypto market capped off another volatile year, artificial intelligence (AI), memecoins, and real-world assets (RWA) emerged as the top-performing sectors, with GameFi and Layer 2 solutions lagging behind. The AI trend has dominated 2024, delivering an average return of 2,940% year to date (YoY). This surge was primarily driven by the popularity of AI tool launchpad Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL), which became the year’s top earner. AI saw a particularly strong year-end rally, nearly doubling its returns from 1,598% to 2,940% in December. This year-end momentum could see AI overtake memecoins as the most profitable trend of 2024. Related News: End of an Era: Terra (LUNA) Founder Do Kwon Leaves Montenegro Under Police Escort Memecoins have followed AI closely, with an impressive 2.185% average annualized return. This trend gained traction in March, when returns skyrocketed from 96.6% to 1,713.1% in a single month. Despite high volatility, memecoins have maintained their leading trend position for much of the year. However, after reaching a record 3,211.4% return on December 9, the sector has seen a pullback as investor interest has begun to wane. Real world assets (RWA) came in third with an average annual return of 820%. The trend experienced steady growth early in the year, peaking at 365.3% in April before entering a period of stagnation. RWA returns rose again in November, driven by the rising price of MANTRA (OM), and rose to their year-end positions. Layer 2: Layer 2 tokens, the only trend to lose money, saw an average decline of 21%. Seven of the top 10 Layer 2 projects reported price declines with losses ranging from 6.3% to 75.3%. The trend of projects building their own Layer 2 networks contributed to the sector’s underperformance. *This is not investment advice.

38358751,https://zycrypto.com/?p=99608,1735677945,Dogecoin High on Raoul Pal’s Bullish Crypto Picks: Here’s What’s on His Radar,"Raoul Pal, the founder and CEO of Real Vision and a popular crypto strategist has shared his top crypto picks for the current bull market, focusing on Dogecoin . Dogecoin is high on his list, alongside other assets showing strong potential. Pal’s picks reflect his strategy of targeting established and emerging tokens that he believes will perform well in the current market cycle. The market has been active, and Pal’s choices shared on December 16 on X highlight key trends investors should watch. Dogecoin: A Key Pick Amid Market Volatility One of the coins in Pal’s portfolio, Dogecoin is valued at $0.31 as per the portfolio. Nonetheless, Dogecoin has been fairly consistent despite recent ups and downs. The meme coin has increased by 2.23% in the last 24 hours and decreased by 12.42% within the last week. The market capitalization of the asset is currently $59.9 billion, with a 24-hour trading volume of $2.63 billion, showing sustained investors’ appetite. Raoul Pal has previously mentioned Dogecoin as one of his top crypto portfolio assets of focus, and his optimism for the token has not wavered. Back in November, on X, Pal cited Dogecoin’s 550% outperformance of Bitcoin since its genesis as evidence of being “harder money” at times than Bitcoin. This sets him in line with his bullish stance on Dogecoin, which remains one of his favorite assets for the current bull run . A Look at Pal’s Broader Crypto Watchlist: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Sui Raoul Pal’s top Crypto picks| Source: X Pal has a number of other digital assets on his radar, which he expects to perform during the bull market. The biggest one by market capitalization – Bitcoin – comes out on top; it is now valued at $2.07 trillion and has rallied 3.86% in the last seven days. Currently, Bitcoin’s 24hr volume is $50.6 billion, thus there is a strong interest from investors. Ethereum (ETH) is also on Pal’s list as well of course, their prices fell slightly during the week, with $404 billion in market capitalization and an ETH price of $3,363. Pal is especially bullish on Solana (SOL), calling it his “main game.” Priced at $194, Solana has a market cap of $93.2 billion. The project has seen growing momentum, which fits Pal’s long-term outlook. Sui (SUI) is another asset to watch. The token has hit new all-time highs and is currently priced at $4.20. It has surged by 13.48% in the past week, making it one of the top performers on Pal’s radar. Meme Coins: DOGE and Smoking Chicken Fish In addition to Dogecoin, Pal is also keeping an eye on meme coins. Smoking Chicken Fish (SCF), another meme coin has jumped 27.54% in daily trading. Meme coins like SCF and Dogecoin can be volatile, but Pal’s confidence in them shows he’s looking for opportunities in these high-risk, high-reward tokens. While Pal focuses on these major assets, he is also building a portfolio of culture NFTs. These long-term investments aim to capitalize on the growing trend in digital culture. Pal has emphasized that his strategy involves balancing immediate profits from some assets with long-term growth in the NFT space. Raoul Pal’s crypto picks, shared on December 16, reflect a well-rounded strategy. Dogecoin remains a key asset in his portfolio despite market fluctuations. His broader watchlist, which includes Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Sui, and meme coins like Smoking Chicken Fish, presents a mix of established leaders and emerging players.",POSITIVE,DOGE | ETH,BTC | DOGE | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/dogecoin-high-on-raoul-pals-bullish-crypto-picks-heres-whats-on-his-radar/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

It was added that Ethereum has what it takes to double more than its current value, while Bitcoin may see a more modest increase. This shift reflects Ethereum’s growing dominance and investor interest in altcoins. Ethereum’s Surge: A Bold Outlook Steno Research forecasted that Ethereum will surge past $8,000 in 2025, doubling its current price of $3,400. The asset would need to increase by approximately 135.29% to achieve this. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s value is projected to rise to at least $150,000, up from about $94,000. This requires an increase of about 59.57% to hit the speculated new mark. The report revealed that this price shift could push the Ethereum/Bitcoin ratio to 0.06, a significant increase from its current 0.0357. This trend follows previous market cycles, where altcoins gained strength and market share. A key factor driving Ethereum’s anticipated growth is the impact of Donald Trump’s potential U.S. presidential victory in 2024. Steno analysts believe that Trump’s leadership will be more beneficial for altcoins than Bitcoin. This shift in political dynamics is expected to drive greater institutional interest and adoption of altcoins, with Ethereum at the forefront. Notably, this Steno Research report starkly contrasts Franklin Templeton’s prediction of sovereign Bitcoin adoption in 2025. Bitcoin’s Dominance to Decline Amid Altcoins Focus and the DeFi Boom While Bitcoin has historically been the dominant player in the crypto space, that dominance is expected to wane in 2025. Steno Research predicted Bitcoin’s market share will drop from its current 56.6% to as low as 45%. This decline would lead investors to diversify their portfolios into a broader range of digital assets. Steno’s report also highlights the growing focus on altcoins, particularly in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. The total value locked (TVL) in decentralized applications (dApps) is expected to hit a record high of $300 billion by 2025. This surge in DeFi activity will further bolster altcoin prices. As expected, Ethereum will continue to lead the charge in smart contracts and decentralized application development. The ETF Factor: A Catalyst for Altcoin and Ethereum Growth Another significant development that could accelerate altcoin growth is the potential introduction of more crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. These ETFs are expected to open the doors for institutional investors, accelerating the adoption of Ethereum and other altcoins. With institutions increasingly entering the crypto space, these ETFs could catalyze more widespread Ethereum and other altcoins adoption. Steno Research predicts that 2025 will witness an unprecedented scale of institutional adoption of crypto, with altcoins benefiting the most.

Musk AI King (MUSKAI), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKAI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk AI King can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk AI King could become the next viral memecoin. Musk AI King launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk AI King on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk AI King by entering its contract address – 8hfjjhqWbfVZsqxCKVQu115AXUzUPTHZFXZwk81rYTMw – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKAI.

38358515,https://zycrypto.com/?p=99606,1735677387,"Bitcoin Demand Eclipse March 2023 Levels, BTC to $200,000?","Investor demand, already exceeding March 2023 levels by 4%, is fueling optimism for new milestones. Bitcoin’s market capitalization came close to $3 trillion during the last surge, according to CoinGecko. As the year-end approaches, all eyes are on the Federal Reserve and its upcoming policy decisions, which could influence Bitcoin’s trajectory. Bitcoin’s Record Demand Meets Market Shifts Bitcoin demand is currently outpacing levels last seen during its $70,000 rally in March 2023. Axel Adler Jr., a researcher and author at CryptoQuant, noted that prior bull cycles saw demand peaks of 205% and 133%, suggesting the current surge could be a prelude to further highs. Source|AxelAdlerJr X This robust appetite for Bitcoin comes as the cryptocurrency matures, with its volatility hitting record lows, according to CryptoBanter show host Kyledoops on X highlighting Glassnode’s data. Source|KyleDoops X He also noted that institutional adoption and market stability are transforming Bitcoin into a dependable financial asset. Adding to the bullish narrative is President-elect Donald Trump’s vocal support for cryptocurrencies . Trump has pledged to make the US a global leader in digital assets, proposing favorable regulations and even a strategic Bitcoin reserve. This policy stance has injected fresh energy into the market, attracting investors seeking exposure to Bitcoin’s long-term potential. Institutional Adoption and Derivatives Betting The institutional pivot toward Bitcoin is unmistakable. MicroStrategy Inc., a Bitcoin-focused firm, is set to join the Nasdaq 100 Index. The inclusion underscores Bitcoin’s growing mainstream acceptance and highlights how corporate entities continue to embrace it as a strategic asset. MicroStrategy, led by Bitcoin permabull Michael Saylor currently holds 439,002 BTC, valued at $46.9 billion at the current market price. This makes Microstrategy the largest corporate HODler of BTC. On the derivatives front, the Deribit options exchange is seeing a concentration of bullish bets at the $120,000 strike price. This reflects traders’ belief in Bitcoin’s ability to extend its gains, particularly as macroeconomic conditions evolve. Analysts at K33 Research note that Bitcoin’s momentum could strengthen during the quiet weeks following the Federal Reserve’s final meeting of 2024. Economic and Political Drivers The Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce a quarter-point rate cut this week, which could bolster Bitcoin’s appeal as a hedge against traditional financial risks. However, market uncertainty remains, given the robust US economic growth and inflation concerns tied to Trump’s broader policy agenda. Bitcoin has also benefited from renewed retail interest. Its price has risen over 55% since Trump’s election victory on November 5, with US-based exchange-traded funds seeing significant inflows. This starkly contrasts Bitcoin’s skepticism a year ago when it traded at $41,000. Bulls, Bears, and the Road Ahead Despite its recent highs, Bitcoin remains a polarizing asset. Axel Adler Jr. highlighted that the market is perpetually divided between doubters and believers. Bitcoin’s cycles of extreme optimism and caution are unlikely to change, even as it pushes toward new records. As Bitcoin consolidates below $100k, the question remains: Is this the calm before another explosive move? With record demand, institutional backing, and favorable macro conditions, Bitcoin appears poised for a decisive end to the year. Whether it can sustain this momentum will depend on a delicate interplay of market forces and policy decisions.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-demand-eclipse-march-2023-levels-btc-to-200000/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

Pepe (PEPE) was among the top gainers, flipping Hyperliquid (HYPE). The Elon Musk effect caused year-end rallies for Pepe (PEPE) and several categories of meme tokens. Musk’s new gaming and social media persona, Kekius Maximus , brought back attention to several meme categories. Pepe (PEPE) returned to $0.000020, while Hyperliquid (HYPE) stagnated around $25. This allowed PEPE to move up the charts, next aiming to overtake the position of Bitcoin Cash (BCH). PEPE trading volumes also moved up to $3.3B in the past 24 hours, the highest level in an otherwise slow week. Frog-themed tokens rallied after Elon Musk selected Pepe the Frog for his new avatar. | Source: CoinGecko Musk’s new avatar and Path of Exile name also sparked rallies for other tokens in the frog-themed category. As a result, the tokens rallied on average by 10% overnight, to a valuation of over $12B. Even minor tokens expanded, following the effect of PEPE. The token rallied based on its wide community reach. At the end of 2024, PEPE became the leader in terms of community wealth. According to meme influencer Murad Mahmudov, the PEPE community had the most wallets with a balance over $1,000. A total of 77,145 holders had over $1,000 worth of PEPE in their wallets, with a trend for long-term holding. PEPE buyers are also active on social media and participate in community-building. PEPE is also widely distributed, as even wallet clusters only hold a small part of the supply. PolitiFi reawakens in the new year PolitiFi tokens were one of the categories to slow down substantially following the November 6 US elections. After Donald Trump’s victory, some of the political memes lost their appeal, as traders shifted to other categories. The revival of frog memes raised the value of PolitiFi tokens, which returned above $500M. The space has been lagging and may bring back the attention of meme communities. The PolitiFi category also benefitted from the rapid gains of Kekius Maximus (KEKIUS), which was added to the list of political tokens. With Donald Trump’s second inauguration coming soon, the PolitiFi meta-narrative is seen as potentially undervalued. The quick reaction of traders shows even previously obscure tokens are closely watched for their potential to rally. Within hours, tokens like KEKIUS and TRUMPUS lined up among the newly trending AI agents, which are dominating meme trading in December. Parody tokens emerge as an undervalued category Parody tokens are a small, but rapidly growing category. This category of tokens showed its ability to react to current events. At the end of December, CoinGecko noted the category was gaining activity. Parody memes track other successful meme formats. This category of meme tokens is still small, but also extremely reactive to current events. Musk’s changed avatar sparked a rally for a little-known token named simply Elon. Parody memes are trending based on the success of WOULD, the leading token as of December 31. Parody memes are catching up to the size of the PolitiFi category, with a total valuation of $571M . This selection of tokens outperformed even the entire collection of Musk-inspired tokens . The one exception is ELONIA, a parody which gained more than 51% in the past week. The recent meme token rallies happened despite the shift of attention to AI agents. The smaller meme collections surpassed the selection of memes by this year’s top influencer, Murad Mahmudov. This time around, Dogecoin (DOGE) hardly budged, despite Musk being one of its early backers. DOGE remained unchanged at around $0.31, as its price requires much bigger inflows to spark a rally. Small-scale, unserious tokens, however, kept driving social media engagement and on-chain activity. The entire meme space made a slight recovery, rising to $109B after recently dipping under the $100B mark. Meme tokens as a whole had one of the highest returns in 2024, with more than 2,100% in total gains.

38358272,https://btc-pulse.com/?p=27903,1735677255,Do Kwon in US Custody Following Montenegro Extradition Battle,"Extradition Battle Co-founder of Terraform Labs Do Kwon was finally extradited to the U.S. after a long court battle in Montenegro. He was arrested in 2023 on charges of using falsified travel documents. In 2023, the U.S. and South Korea issued extradition requests for Kwon . On Dec. 31, Montenegrin Prime Minister Milojko Spajić announced that Kwon was transferred to US custody to bring the complex legal standoff to an end. Why the US and South Korea Wanted Kwon Kwon was at the center of the disastrous implosion of the Terra ecosystem in 2022. The incident resulted in billions of dollars in losses and contributed to a broader cryptocurrency market downturn. Regulators in the US and South Korea charged Kwon with fraud, conspiracy, and market manipulation. Until his arrest, there had been international interest in his whereabouts, but his location was not known. It was in Montenegro that he was arrested. Legal Challenges in Montenegro Kwon served four months in prison in Montenegro following his arrest for the use of fake travel documents. However, his legal status has remained very unclear since the courts debated over extradition to either the US or South Korea. Appeals from his legal team delayed the court proceedings by more than one year. Finally, the Justice Minister Bojan Božović approved extradition to the US on Dec. 27. Charges Kwon Faces in the US The US Justice Department charged Kwon with eight felony counts, including wire fraud, commodities fraud, and conspiracy to engage in market manipulation. In addition, the US Securities and Exchange Commission, earlier in 2023, found him and Terraform Labs liable for fraud and ordered them to pay around $4.5 billion in penalties, disgorgement, and prejudgment interest. Montenegro Committed to Justice Montenegrin Prime Minister Spajić outlined the commitment of the nation to international justice. “This extradition is a proof of our commitment to international justice and rule of law”, he said. What’s Next for Kwon? Far from over are all the legal battles with his extradition. He is expected to see US courts soon, when further developments in the case may emerge. Kwon’s case is a big example in crypto fraud enforcement worldwide. His case shows how many countries are collaborating to persecute such fraudsters.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | LUNA | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,BTC Pulse,https://btc-pulse.com/us-custody-following-montenegro-extradition-battle/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png

As we close out a historic year for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, some crypto-related equities are poised to end 2024 well into the green. Here’s a round-up of some of the best performers: Coinbase COIN shares started the year around $156. The stock rallied into the high-$200s in March, coinciding with bitcoin’s run-up to what was then a new all-time high of around $73,000. COIN’s big breakout came in the latter half of the year, though. Shares gained 67% between election night and Nov. 11, a sign investors saw Trump’s win as a major turning point for the industry. Boutique equity research firm Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co. raised its price target for the exchange from $245 to $390 earlier this month. Analysts cited the Trump Administration’s potential plan to create a strategic bitcoin reserve as a positive catalyst for Coinbase’s custody services. COIN shares were up 58% year to date (to ~$247) at 2 pm ET Tuesday. MicroStrategy MicroStrategy, an unprofitable business intelligence company, started buying bitcoin back in 2020. Today, the firm has 446,400 BTC (acquired for an average price of $62,428 per coin), and execs say they have no intention of slowing down anytime soon . These days, MSTR is essentially a leveraged trade on BTC, and for those who bought shares at the beginning of the year, it’s paid off. The stock has gained more than 60% since Election Day alone. MSTR shares stood at $290 at 2 pm ET — up 323% in 2024. Miners Hut 8, Core Scientific Bitcoin miner Hut 8 made its public market debut in 2018 at around $17 a share. The stock hit a record high of almost $80 in 2021, a rally analysts attribute to bitcoin’s run and Hut 8’s mining operation expansion . After shares stalled in 2022 and 2023, Hut 8 saw another surge this year, once again thanks to record-high bitcoin prices and new mining technology. Recent price targets from Cantor Fitzgerald and Craig Hallum are in the mid-$30 range. HUT shares were up 63% year to date at 2 pm ET Tuesday, just north of $20. Up even more is the share price for rival miner Core Scientific, which has increased roughly 300% in 2024. The company emerged from bankruptcy in January, relisting on the Nasdaq. Core Scientific’s stock surged to above $7 in June right after inking its first hosting deal with cloud provider CoreWeave. CORZ’s share price hovered around $14 on Tuesday afternoon.

Have you been monitoring the crypto market and wondering how some early entries yielded significant returns? Or have you ever regretted missing out on presale events that later soared in value, wishing you had participated earlier? Crypto presales present an exclusive opportunity to engage at the ground level, often at significantly lower than their future prices. Don’t worry! This guide highlights the top presales that are not only full of promise but also brimming with features that might lead to remarkable results. From BlockDAG and 5thScape to Flockerz, these emerging crypto projects could revolutionize the future of digital currencies. Let’s explore how these altcoins with the most potential for 2025 stand out and why they deserve attention. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): Revolutionizing Scalability with DAG Technology At the forefront, BlockDAG (BDAG) is revolutionizing blockchain with its Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology. This advanced structure removes common bottlenecks, enabling smooth scalability and secure transactions. Supported by a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus, BlockDAG offers solid security, maintains decentralization, and ensures efficient mining operations. Its network handles 10 blocks per second with ambitions to exceed 100, creating a strong and fair ecosystem. Moreover, BlockDAG’s user-friendly technology allows for easy smart contract creation, accessible even to those with minimal technical background. This welcoming approach broadens participation in decentralized applications (dApps), boosting adoption and sparking further innovation. BlockDAG’s presale achievements highlight its significant potential. It has garnered over $174 million and distributed more than 17.6 billion BDAG coins in 26 rounds. Early participants have witnessed returns of 2,240%, as the price rose from $0.001 to $0.0234. With a community surpassing 170,000 and presale funds approaching the $600 million goal, anticipation is high for its 2025 mainnet debut. Experts believe BlockDAG could realize a future ROI of 20,000x, making it one of the top altcoins with the most potential for 2025. 2. 5thScape (5SCAPE): Merging Virtual Reality with Blockchain Next in our rundown of altcoins with the most potential is 5thScape (5SCAPE), which is transforming digital interactions through its extensive VR ecosystem. This forward-thinking project effectively combines gaming, education, healthcare, and commerce into a comprehensive platform for varied virtual reality experiences. Armed with cutting-edge VR equipment like the SwiftScape gaming chair and the Ultra HD VR headset, 5thScape is set to enhance engagement in multiple fields. Having secured $8.6 million in presale funds, 5thScape is shaping a future where virtual reality and blockchain technologies merge flawlessly. 3. Best Wallet Token (BEST): Enhancing Digital Asset Management Best Wallet Token (BEST) fuels a platform that simplifies managing and trading digital assets. It stands out among the top altcoins with the most potential for its benefits like lower trading fees, increased staking rewards, and user influence over operational decisions. It also offers unique features such as the “Upcoming Tokens” page and a staking aggregator to maximize returns. With a circulating supply of 10 billion and a strategic roadmap in place, BEST is crucial in propelling the growth of the Best Wallet ecosystem. This mix of functionality and innovation earmarks BEST as a significant choice for those examining the future of digital currencies. 4. Flockerz (FLOCK): Leading with a Community Focus Concluding our selection of altcoins with the most potential is Flockerz (FLOCK), which is reimagining meme coins through its unique Vote-to-Earn mechanism. Via its decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), participants directly influence the project’s direction while receiving rewards for their involvement. This method cultivates a dedicated community and encourages ongoing development. Beyond the incentives for voting, Flockerz provides staking options, offering participants a chance to earn passively while bolstering the ecosystem. With more than $8.2 million raised in its presale, Flockerz has gained considerable attention. Its combination of community engagement and potential for returns marks it as an exciting project in the cryptocurrency space. Altcoin with the Most Potential: Who Leads the Pack? Each of these emerging crypto projects introduces something distinct. From 5thScape’s immersive VR platform to Flockerz’s community-led framework and Best Wallet Token’s practical benefits, these altcoins showcase innovation and promise.

38358084,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53532,1735676146,Best Meme Coin Presales to Invest in for Short Term: BTFD Coin Hits Big with Bulls as Shiba Inu and SPX6900 Redefine Crypto Culture,"What if your next big win in crypto wasn’t just about timing the market—but about joining a movement that thrives on every dip? Welcome to the world of meme coins, where culture meets crypto, and the BTFD Coin presale is blazing a trail that every investor is itching to follow. With Shiba Inu (SHIB) and SPX6900 (SPX) already making waves, the next big question isn’t “when” but “what” to invest in. The spotlight is on BTFD Coin, a next-gen meme coin redefining presales with its bold approach, unique Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, and thriving community. As it enters the 13th stage of its presale, the buzz is undeniable. But how does it compare to meme coin juggernauts like Shiba Inu and SPX6900? Let’s break it down. BTFD Coin: Turning Dips into Dominance In a market where every dip sparks panic, BTFD Coin flips the script. Inspired by the iconic trading mantra “Buy the Dip,” this meme coin is all about making downturns work for you. And with over 60 billion coins sold to 7000+ bulls, it’s not just a crypto project—it’s a movement. BTFD Coin’s presale, currently in its 13th stage, has already raised $4.7 million, with coins priced at $0.000142. But it’s not just about numbers. The heart of BTFD lies in its utility and vision. BTFD Coin offers robust staking rewards, a high-octane P2E game, and a tokenomics model designed to empower its community. Don’t miss the chance to grab 50% extra BTFD coins by using the BIG50 code during your purchase. For example, if you invest $4,000 at the Stage 13 price of $0.000142 per coin, you’ll receive 42,253,521 coins after applying the BIG50 bonus. When the coin hits $0.0006 at the end of the presale, your investment would grow to $25,352.11, giving you a profit of $21,352.11. It’s an easy and exciting way to maximise your returns. Imagine leading a digital charge as part of the Bulls Squad in the BTFD P2E game, smashing through levels, and unlocking rewards. The excitement is palpable while the beta version is live (minus rewards for now). The game brings a fresh twist to meme coins, integrating entertainment and community engagement like never before. Whether you’re tackling challenging levels or inviting friends to join, the BTFD game ensures that every interaction adds value to the ecosystem. BTFD’s staking programme is also a game-changer for those who believe in holding. With an APY of up to 90%, your holdings don’t just sit there—they grow. Imagine staking 500 BTFD tokens today and seeing your balance multiply over time. It’s not just an investment; it’s a commitment to the BTFD community. BTFD isn’t just about individual gains. Its referral programme fosters a sense of community while offering tangible rewards. Share your unique code, invite friends to buy $BTFD, and earn 10% of their purchase. With over $1 million raised in under 10 days, this programme is a testament to the project’s appeal and community-driven growth. In short, the BTFD Coin isn’t just another meme coin. It’s a masterclass in how to rally a community around a shared vision. Shiba Inu: The Dog That Rules the Pack When it comes to meme coins, Shiba Inu needs no introduction. Launched as a playful homage to Dogecoin, SHIB has grown into a full-fledged ecosystem with its own decentralised exchange, ShibaSwap, and projects spanning NFTs, gaming, and beyond. Shiba Inu captured the crypto community’s imagination with its explosive growth and a loyal following that refers to itself as the “ShibArmy.” Over the years, it has become more than a meme coin, evolving into a platform that promotes decentralisation and accessibility. For crypto enthusiasts, SHIB isn’t just a token—it’s a statement. SHIB’s appeal lies in its ecosystem. From staking rewards on ShibaSwap to the upcoming Shibarium layer-2 blockchain, Shiba Inu continues to innovate. The token’s versatility and vibrant community make it a go-to choice for both new and seasoned investors. While SHIB’s journey from a meme to a mainstream crypto asset is impressive, it serves a different purpose than BTFD Coin. Shiba Inu has matured into a more complex project, but the simplicity and focused vision of BTFD sets it apart in the current meme coin frenzy. SPX6900: A New Challenger with Big Ambitions SPX6900, affectionately dubbed SPX, is another player in the meme coin space that’s turning heads. Known for its bold branding and playful take on crypto culture, SPX is carving a niche among meme coin enthusiasts. SPX thrives on its vibrant community, which rallies around its irreverent humour and meme-driven campaigns. But it’s not just all fun and games. SPX has built credibility with strategic partnerships and integrations that hint at its long-term potential. While SPX started as a meme, it’s gradually exploring use cases beyond speculation. Its foray into decentralised applications and NFTs adds a layer of credibility, making it more than just a fleeting trend. Don’t Miss The Best Meme Coin Presales to Invest in for Short Term Gains Based on our deep dive into the world of meme coins, it’s clear that each project has its strengths. Shiba Inu’s ecosystem and SPX6900’s cultural appeal are undeniably impressive. But when it comes to the best meme coin presales to invest in for short term gains, BTFD Coin is in a league of its own. With its presale underway, millions raised, and an ambitious roadmap, BTFD is the opportunity you’ve been waiting for. Don’t just watch the crypto wave from the sidelines.

You watched as others turned a small stack into life-changing gains. Regret bites deep, doesn’t it? But here’s the thing—the next big wave is forming, and you can ride it. With meme coins leading the frenzy again, there’s no better time to jump into projects like BTFD Coin, Mog Coin, and Degen. These tokens aren’t just about laughs but community, utility, and insane potential returns. The BTFD meme coin (BTFD) is turning heads with its explosive presale success. Stage 13 of the presale is live, and over $4.7 million has been raised so far, with 60 billion coins snapped up by over 7100 Bulls. If you thought catching dips was thrilling, the BTFD ecosystem promises a bull market experience. But how does it stack up against meme coin giants like Mog Coin and the ever-popular Degen? Let’s dive in and find out. BTFD Coin: Seizing the Dip with a Pioneering Vision BTFD Coin is more than just a meme; it’s a movement for traders who know that every dip is an opportunity in disguise. Built on Ethereum, this token has stormed through its presale, raising over $1 million in just 10 days and crossing the $2.5 million mark within two weeks. Now in Stage 13, the presale offers $BTFD coins at $0.000142 each, a bargain compared to its planned post-presale price of $0.0006. Play2Earn Gaming and Community Utility What sets BTFD Coin apart is its unique Play2Earn (P2E) game, now in beta. Imagine immersing yourself in a high-energy crypto game where you rack up coins, complete challenges, and climb leaderboards. Although rewards aren’t available in the beta, this game lays the foundation for a thrilling addition to the ecosystem, where gameplay translates into staking opportunities and real-world value. Staking Rewards: Passive Gains Simplified BTFD also packs a punch with its staking mechanism. Bulls who stake their coins during the presale are looking at an average APY of 90%. Over time, this incentivises holding, reinforcing the community and ecosystem stability. Think about it: staking $BTFD coins today could potentially double your holdings in just a year. Maximize your investment with the BIG50 code, which gives you 50% extra BTFD coins. An $8,000 investment at $0.000142 per coin grants you 92,307,692 coins. When the price climbs to $0.0006 at the presale’s end, your investment will grow to $55,384.62, offering a $47,384.62 profit. Secure your gains now! A Community-Driven Revolution BTFD has rallied traders from its inception with a mindset: buy low, hold firm, and profit big. This ethos resonates deeply in the crypto space, creating a tight-knit community that’s hungry for the next bull run. By integrating its P2E game and staking rewards into the mix, BTFD isn’t just selling a token; it’s offering a lifestyle. So, how do you get in? It’s simple: Set up your wallet with MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Load it with BNB, ETH, or USDT. Connect your wallet to the BTFD presale site. Select your currency, buy BTFD coins, and confirm the transaction. Claim your coins once the presale ends, and start your staking journey. This isn’t just another presale; it’s your golden ticket into the meme coin market’s most promising ecosystem. Mog Coin: The Cat’s Meow in Crypto If BTFD Coin represents the bold new wave, Mog Coin (MOG) is the stalwart of cat-themed meme coins. With a market cap and listings on Coinbase and Binance Futures, Mog Coin has proven itself a heavyweight contender in the meme coin arena. What Makes Mog Coin Stand Out? Community is king in the crypto world, and MOG has one of the most vibrant ones around. Fans love its playful branding and its association with pop culture—a winning formula that continues to attract new investors. But Mog Coin isn’t just about the laughs; it’s about building an ecosystem that fosters engagement and innovation. Leveraging Exchange Listings Mog Coin’s listings on major platforms like Binance Futures have solidified its position in the market. High-leverage trading options (up to 75x) have drawn in seasoned traders, adding liquidity and stability to the token’s ecosystem. These listings have also boosted MOG’s visibility, making it a go-to choice for meme coin enthusiasts. The Long Game MOG continues to thrive as a meme coin with staying power. Its success shows that a strong brand and dedicated community can elevate a token to remarkable heights even in a crowded market. While it’s an established project compared to BTFD’s budding ecosystem, it still serves as a testament to what a focused meme coin strategy can achieve. Degen: The Original Meme Coin Frenzy Degen (DEGEN) is a name that echoes through the halls of crypto history. Known for its unapologetically chaotic energy, Degen has built a reputation as the ultimate meme coin for risk-takers.

The CoinDesk policy team (or reg pod, as I like to call us) jotted down some notes for what we're watching and expecting in 2025.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  New Year's Eve  The narrative  Donald Trump will become the 47th President of the U.S., the European Union's Markets in Crypto Assets legislation is now in effect and the U.K. expects to publish draft legislation.  Why it matters  Here's what might affect the crypto industry next year.  Breaking it down  Nikhilesh De: While 2024 may not have seen any criminal trials quite as high-profile as USA v. Samuel Bankman-Fried, there were still a number of criminal and civil trials we followed. Many of these will continue into 2025 — including, as it happens, Bankman-Fried's ongoing appeal of his conviction last year on fraud and conspiracy charges. To quickly recap, in September Bankman-Fried's new attorneys filed a lengthy brief arguing that District Judge Lewis Kaplan, who oversaw his trial, was biased against the former FTX CEO. Bankman-Fried's team requested a new trial, alleging Kaplan's comments throughout the trial biased the jury.  In a reply brief filed earlier this month, attorneys with the Department of Justice wrote that Kaplan had properly instructed the jury as to the law and how the members of the panel should come to their verdicts. The judge also did not deride the defense, the DOJ said, but rather urged both the defense and prosecution to keep the trial moving.  ""Nor does it matter that certain media sources played up the drama of these exchanges,"" the brief said. The DOJ referenced the defense filing, which said, ""Here, many 'objective observers' have already questioned the judge’s impartiality"" citing an article from Slate and the author of this particular newsletter section. The conviction should not be tossed, the DOJ said.  Bankman-Fried's team asked for an extension to file an ""oversized reply brief"" by Jan. 31, which the Second Circuit Court of Appeals granted. His team is also asking for a hearing for oral arguments.  Perhaps more immediately relevant to the broader crypto industry: There are a number of civil cases still pending from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. SEC Chair Gary Gensler announced he would step down from the role on Jan. 20, when President-elect Donald Trump is inaugurated. Trump has already named former Commissioner Paul Atkins as his nominee for chair of the agency, and it seems pretty likely the agency may shift how it approaches future lawsuits against crypto industry participants. Less clear is how the agency might handle its ongoing cases against companies like Coinbase, Binance, Binance.US, Kraken and others. No attorney seems to think the SEC will outright dismiss these cases, but the next few months of briefs will be more indicative of where the regulator will take them.  Back in the criminal world, Do Kwon's extradition to the U.S. was approved last Friday, suggesting he may actually face trial here. (Given the months of back-and-forth on where Kwon would end up, it's hard to know for sure how this will actually proceed right now.)  Tornado Cash developer Roman Storm's trial on criminal charges tied to the development and operation of the crypto mixing service was pushed to 2025. District Judge Katherine Polk Failla most recently ruled against Storm's efforts to limit certain pretrial expert disclosures. Expert disclosures are now due by early March. In the meantime, Storm also filed a motion asking the judge to reconsider her denial of his motion to dismiss the case, citing a Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals decision saying the U.S. Treasury Department can't sanction Tornado Cash's smart contracts.  The decision affects counts one, two and three in the criminal indictment against Storm, the filing said.  ""Any IEEPA [International Emergency Economic Powers Act] violation must be knowing and willful, i.e., deliberate, but Van Loon makes clear that there is no deliberate action Mr. Storm could have taken here,"" the new filing said. ""Moreover, the developers’ lack of control over the proceeds renders them legally incapable of conspiring to commit money laundering and negates the knowledge element of a money laundering charge. Van Loon’s emphasis on control, as well as its holdings that the immutable Tornado Cash smart contracts are not a 'service' performed for a fee or profit, also lend support to Mr. Storm’s arguments for dismissal of Count Two, the money transmitting business charge.""  Jesse Hamilton: This is what the crypto world has been waiting for — a like-minded Congress and a booster in the White House. So, now we get down to the detailed (and perilous) work of actual policymaking. Those who will be in charge of the relevant committees in Congress have indicated they'll be jumping off from the foundation set down by the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) bill and the existing stablecoin legislation negotiation. But there are a lot of wrinkles still to iron out before those can reach a bipartisan finish line.  Though Republicans have ascended, the effort does have to come from both parties, because the Senate tends to require broad consensus before it can approve legislation. Even when much of Congress agrees on something, it doesn't always bring a win, and this will be a particularly distracted legislative body as it pivots to the agenda of President-elect Trump (which comes with a lot of other controversial and potentially more urgent priorities on such matters as taxation and immigration).  Bottom line: Post-election excitement often settles into a why-is-this-taking-so-long vibe. Digital assets enthusiasts shouldn't be surprised if things get well into 2025 without landing the crypto bills they're waiting for.  When the market-structure bill does get approved, it'll almost certainly install the Commodity Futures Trading Commission as its primary watchdog for crypto trading. While the digital assets crowds may rejoice at the de-emphasizing of the Securities and Exchange Commission, they should also keep in mind a few things: Once legislation is in place, it may take the agencies a year or more to implement the actual rules the industry will be operating under. There's a long process in which the SEC and CFTC will propose regulations and review public comments before they can pull the trigger. Also, the CFTC isn't experienced in spot-market oversight and doesn't have the staff to handle that workload. So the adjustment to the new system may require a heavy dose of patience from a sector that has already waited around for years.   Despite the industry's special loathing for the SEC, it'll still be a very prominent part of life for those operating in the U.S. Some crypto will be classified as securities, requiring registration for the projects and for the platforms where they change hands. Once the laws are set, the industry will no longer have the option of shrugging off the views of the feds, and agency officials will come crawling through their businesses on a regular basis with magnifying glasses and flashlights.  Yes, there will be compliance headaches, but U.S. regulation may bring investors and entrepreneurs off the sidelines and set a global standard for the industry. An SEC run by Paul Atkins, a conservative former commissioner who has done crypto work, could also rapidly repeal the agency's crypto accounting guidance known as Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121 (SAB 121). New banking regulators may insist on U.S. banks welcoming back crypto customers. And the Department of the Treasury might shift its view on crypto taxes and overseas sanctions.  With the future president literally being in the business of crypto, it's hard to imagine it won't at least be among the second-tier priorities for Trump's administration.  Camomile Shumba: The U.K. is the Labour Party's now after 14 years under the Conservative Party, which proclaimed great crypto hopes such as turning the country into a digital assets hub. Most knew Labour would eventually take over, which they did in July with a landslide victory. Last year I said the big question on everyone's mind would be: What would things look like under Labour? The answer could feature a decidedly different crypto approach.  There was a long wait between July and Labour's announcement of its crypto approach in November, only for the new government to say it was sticking to the Conservatives' plan — except rather than doing a phased approach by releasing different bits of legislation for different aspects of crypto at different times, the government will instead put everything in place at once, starting with unleashing draft legislation early 2025.  The Financial Conduct Authority, as the regulator overseeing crypto, handed the industry a timeline for how it will roll out and implement rules. In 2025, the government will publish papers on stablecoins, custody and prudential rules, staking, lending and trading.  Labour said even before it was elected it would support the country in becoming a securities tokenization hub as well as advance plans on the digital pound. A decision on the digital pound, a digital token issued by a central bank could be announced in 2025. The government also launched a pilot for a digital gilt - aka a british bond - so that will be something I'll be watching.  I expect the U.K. will keep a close eye on the European Union which is enforcing its crypto regime.  I will also be monitoring the EU's implementation of its Markets in Crypto Assets legislation. Currently, six countries do not have legislation in place to even enforce the European Union's wide-ranging MiCA legislation.  So, how will these countries keep up with other nations like France who have already been accepting applications for the new regime since July? I suspect other countries may also shine — like the Netherlands, which has been receiving Crypto Asset Service Provider license applications since April and has already begun approving them.  We will also monitor what companies manage to get into the EU. I think many will find it hard to attain the coveted CASP license that enables them to operate across the bloc.  In a recent report the EU said it will issue a final draft of the digital euro rulebook. The trading bloc will consider whether or not to issue a digital euro once the legislation has been put in place, it said.  The new EU commissioners — in charge of proposing legislation and overseeing implementation — have now been positioned. On their crypto agenda will be assessing whether or not regulation for decentralized finance activities, lending and borrowing and non-fungible token activity is necessary.  Cheyenne Ligon:  Given the crypto-friendliness of the new administration and the number of crypto supporters in Congress, I think it's reasonable to think that we'll get a piece of crypto regulation passed in 2025. My money is on stablecoin legislation passing first.  I think at least one state will establish some sort of strategic bitcoin reserve (SBR) in 2025 but the federal government will not.  I think we will see fewer crypto-related enforcement actions from the SEC next year.  Once Trump takes office, I think it is likely that his crypto project, World Liberty Financial, will quietly fade into obscurity.

Do Kwon Extradited Over Terra Luna Collapse According to reports, Kwon was extradited at the Podgorica Airport border crossing by Interpol and Montenegrin officials. In a December 31 X post, Spajić confirmed Kwon’s extradition to the United States, though it remains unclear just exactly where the purported crypto fraudster is being held. “Our nation WELCOMES INNOVATION and legitimate crypto, AI and other tech entrepreneurs – but we have ZERO TOLERANCE FOR FRAUD,” Spajić said. “This extradition demonstrates our unwavering commitment to international justice and the rule of law!” Terraform Labs Founder’s Life On The Run News of Kwon’s arrival in the United States comes after the country battled for his extradition for months against the one-time crypto tycoon’s native South Korea. Kwon first came under fire in May 2022 when his algorithmic stablecoins Terra USD and LUNA crushed, effectively erasing over $40 billion from cryptocurrency markets The purported crypto fraudster then fled from authorities in a months-long manhunt across Asia and Europe as Interpol pursued the one-time wunderkind, though Kwon denied being on the lam from global law enforcement officials. I am not “on the run” or anything similar – for any government agency that has shown interest to communicate, we are in full cooperation and we don’t have anything to hide — Do Kwon (@stablekwon) September 17, 2022 “I am not “on the run” or anything similar – for any government agency that has shown interest to communicate, we are in full cooperation and we don’t have anything to hide,” Kwon wrote in a September 2022 X post. The former founder was originally arrested in Montenegro in March 2023, where he has since been in custody, for falsifying travel documents as he attempted to flee the Balkan country for Dubai. Kwon is facing eight criminal counts in the United States, including securities fraud, commodities fraud, and wire fraud. Despite the severity of the charges, this will not be Kwon’s first experience with the U.S. judicial system. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued the Stanford grad and Terraform Labs back in 2023 for defrauding investors as part of the massive crypto scheme. Both Kwon and the crypto firm agreed to pay a combined total of $4.5 billion as part of a settlement agreement with the federal regulator in June 2024. “Terraform and Do Kwon’s fraudulent activities caused devastating losses for investors, in some cases wiping out entire life savings,” outgoing SEC chair Gary Gensler said in a statement . “Their fraud serves as a reminder that, when firms fail to comply with the law, investors get hurt.” The post Montenegro Confirms Completed Extradition of Do Kwon on Tuesday appeared first on Cryptonews .",NEGATIVE,LUNA,ASIA | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | LUNA | REGULATION,,0,0,cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/montenegro-confirms-completed-extradition-of-do-kwon-on-tuesday/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/38360638.jpeg
38357588,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=376783,1735675837,"Notorious ‘Blockchain Bandit’ Resurfaces, Moves 51,000 ETH in Largest Fund Transfer","After a brief hiatus, the notorious “Blockchain Bandit” has re-emerged as the year ends, consolidating a staggering 51,000 ETH, valued at approximately $172 million, into a single multisig wallet. This transfer was made on December 30. “Blockchain Bandit” Returns In the latest update , prominent blockchain investigator ZachXBT revealed that the consolidation originated from 10 wallets, which have been dormant for almost two years, with the last activity being flagged in January 2023. Alongside the Ether transfer, 470 BTC were also moved. The Blockchain Bandit earned infamy between 2016 and 2018 through an insidious technique called “ Ethercombing .” By exploiting cryptographic vulnerabilities, the attacker systematically guessed weak private keys, which were often generated by faulty random number algorithms or misconfigured wallets. This method allowed the malicious entity to steal more than 45,000 ETH across 49,060 transactions by compromising 732 private keys. While brute-forcing private keys is generally deemed improbable due to their vast numerical range, the Bandit capitalized on predictable flaws such as non-random key generation and poorly implemented recovery phrases. Cybersecurity analysts suggest that state-sponsored actors, possibly North Korean hacker groups, could be behind the attacks, noting parallels with other large-scale crypto thefts. Such groups are known to target cryptocurrency platforms to fund illicit operations, including weapons programs. The Bandit’s recent activity – coupled with the use of multi-signature wallets – signals preparations for potentially laundering the funds through mixers or decentralized exchanges to obscure their origins. From Fake Meetings to Seed Phrase Traps This attacker’s resurgence comes amid a wider uptick in crypto cybercrime as fraudsters develop new strategies to ensnare unsuspecting targets. Earlier this month, hackers were reported to have exploited fake Zoom meeting links to target crypto users and steal sensitive credentials as well as digital assets. SlowMist traced the malware’s code to Russian-linked operatives, revealing over $1 million converted to ETH. Another scam targeted opportunistic thieves by sharing seed phrases of fake crypto wallets. Once accessed, the wallets demand TRX for transaction fees, rerouting funds to scammers instead. Kaspersky warns that this scheme, disguised as a beginner’s mistake, manipulates thieves into becoming victims of their own greed.

38357353,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=668358,1735675252,"Bitcoin Decline Continues: Is $86,800 The Level To Watch?","On-chain data shows the Realized Price of the Bitcoin short-term holders lies at $86,800 right now, making the level one to watch. Bitcoin Is Still At A Notable Gap From Short-Term Holder Cost Basis In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has discussed the trend in the profit-loss status of the Bitcoin short-term holders. The indicator of relevance here is the “Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio,” which keeps track of the ratio between BTC’s Market Cap and its Realized Cap. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sentiment Now Worst Since Mid-October: Reversal Signal? The “Realized Cap” here refers to an on-chain capitalization model for the cryptocurrency that assumes the ‘real’ value of each token in circulation is the price at which it was last transacted on the blockchain. Since the last transfer of any coin is likely to correspond to the last instance of it changing hands, the price at its time could be considered as its current cost basis. Thus, the Realized Cap is nothing, but the sum of the capital that the investors as a whole have used to purchase the cryptocurrency. In contrast, the Market Cap represents the value that the holders are carrying right now. As the MVRV Ratio compares these two models, its value tells us about the profit-loss situation of the network. The traditional MVRV Ratio measures this for the entire market, but the version of the metric that’s of interest in the current topic is that specifically for the short-term holders (STHs), investors who purchased their coins within the past 155 days. Below is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in the Bitcoin STH MVRV Ratio over the past year or so: As displayed in the graph, the Bitcoin STH MVRV Ratio spiked to notable levels above the 1 mark when the recent leg up in the BTC rally took place. The indicator being above this value implies the Market Cap of the group is greater than its Realized Cap, and so, the average member is in a state of profit. Recently, as the decline in the cryptocurrency’s price has occurred, the indicator has naturally gone down. Its value still remains above the 1 level, though, suggesting profits held by the cohort still outweigh the losses. At present, the STH MVRV Ratio is sitting at 1.08, which corresponds to the group holding unrealized gains of around 8%. Historically, the STHs have shown to represent the fickle-minded side of the market that easily participates in selloffs, so their being in large profits has tended to be a danger sign for the price. The cohort is no longer making significant profits after the drawdown, but perhaps a cooldown may need to happen if the risk of profit-taking has to go away. A metric that makes it convenient to track when this could happen is the “Realized Price,” which is derived from the Realized Cap by dividing it with the total number of tokens in circulation. Related Reading: Dogecoin To Rally 6,770% If This Pattern Holds: Crypto Analyst From the chart, it’s visible that the STH Realized Price has a value of $86,800 right now, which means the group will be just breaking-even on its investment if Bitcoin falls to this level. BTC Price Bitcoin briefly fell under the $92,000 level yesterday, but the coin has found a small rebound as its price is now trading around $94,500.

Tron has clocked record daily earnings of $21.66 million, with forecasts hinting at a potential leap to $1 by 2025. Its focus on decentralized finance has spurred a surge in transactions and stablecoin circulation, solidifying its standing as a powerhouse blockchain platform. Tron’s ecosystem is further fortified by strategic moves like the T3 Financial Crime Unit, a collaboration with Tether and TRM Labs to bolster network security. Additionally, founder Justin Sun’s investments, like his $30 million infusion into World Liberty Financial, elevate Tron’s market presence. With Tron’s price maintaining stability, the network’s forward leaps position it as an attractive choice for blockchain and DeFi aficionados. Insights & Forecasts While Solana and Tron parade their prowess with scalable systems and stable pricing supported by record earnings and DeFi expansion, BlockDAG steals the spotlight with its unique offerings and proactive stance.

Trump the Grinch (TRUMPGRI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPGRI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports.

Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump the Grinch could become the next viral memecoin. Trump the Grinch launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump the Grinch on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump the Grinch by entering its contract address – 93BLFCVkzBwnSUUjiyaVRQSpjEvaXdZe3oS3iyHnhind – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPGRI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trump-the-grinch-trumpgri-solana-memecoin-to-surge-19000-before-exchange-listing-as-doge-and-shiba-inu-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

The extradition was confirmed today by local news outlet Vijesti, citing a statement from the Montenegrin Ministry of Justice. “Today, at the Podgorica Airport border gate, South Korean citizen Kwon Do-Hyung, who was wanted by two countries, South Korea and the United States, was extradited by NCB Interpol Podgorica authorities with the support of the special police unit,” the ministry said. Kwon, the former CEO of Terraform Labs, was handed over to US law enforcement and FBI agents following a decision by the Montenegrin Justice Ministry. The move marks the culmination of months of legal proceedings in Montenegro, where Kwon faces rival extradition requests from the US and South Korea. Related News: South Korea's Cryptocurrency Exchanges Announce Joint Decision to Delist This Altcoin Do Kwon faces multiple charges in the United States, including conspiracy to commit securities fraud, money laundering and wire fraud, in connection with his role in the collapse of algorithmic stablecoins and cryptocurrencies TerraUSD and LUNA, which wiped out billions of dollars in investor funds. The extradition comes after Montenegrin Justice Minister Bojan Božović signed the decision to extradite Kwon to the United States after receiving approval from the Montenegrin Constitutional Court on Friday. In September, Montenegro’s Constitutional Court ruled that the final decision on Kwon’s extradition would be made by the Justice Minister. The decision to send Kwon to the US was influenced by the seriousness of the charges, where the crimes were committed, the order of the extradition requests and the potential for further extraditions, the ministry said. *This is not investment advice.

38357239,https://cryptonews.com/?p=323840,1735674510,"Switzerland Explores Bitcoin Reserve, Inspired by $27 Billion Gold Holdings","Switzerland is exploring an initiative to amend Article 99 of its Federal Constitution, allowing the Swiss National Bank (SNB) to hold Bitcoin as part of its national reserves. The proposal, spearheaded by Giw Zanganeh , Vice President of Energy and Mining at Tether, aims to modernize the country’s reserve portfolio by including BTC alongside its $27 billion gold holdings. Today we officially launched the popular initiative to add #Bitcoin to the @SNB_BNS Swiss National Bank’s balance sheet. https://t.co/Y40yh9pW3X We will need the full support of our community to gather 100k signatures and make this a national referendum. Details will follow… — Giw Zanganeh (@gzanganeh) December 31, 2024 Published in the Federal Gazette (Bundesblatt) today, the initiative begins its signature collection phase, requiring 100,000 handwritten endorsements from Swiss citizens by June 30, 2025. If successful, the Swiss Federal Assembly will review the amendment, potentially positioning Switzerland as a global leader in Bitcoin adoption. The SNB’s current reserves are highly diversified, including fiat currencies and approximately 1,040 tons of gold. Advocates argue that adding BTC offers a robust hedge against inflation and aligns with Switzerland’s reputation for financial innovation. Unlike a similar 2021 initiative that fell short, this proposal gains momentum amidst global interest in BTC as a strategic reserve asset. Global Trends in Bitcoin Reserves Switzerland’s move mirrors growing interest among nations to include Bitcoin in their financial strategies. In the U.S., discussions are underway to establish a strategic BTC reserve. Germany’s former finance minister, Christian Lindner, has also pushed for Bitcoin adoption within the European Central Bank (ECB) and Germany’s national reserves. The proposed amendment would require minimal legislative changes, adding just two to three words to Clause 3 of Article 99, stating that reserves must include BTC alongside gold. Proponents highlight the low-risk, high-reward potential of this inclusion, which could significantly impact Bitcoin’s credibility on a global scale. Switzerland, already recognized as a crypto pioneer, has laid the groundwork for such an initiative. Its canton of Zug—dubbed “Crypto Valley”—introduced Bitcoin payments for government services as early as 2016, showcasing the nation’s proactive stance on blockchain technology. Bitcoin Price Outlook Amid National Reserve Talks Bitcoin (BTC/USD) is trading at $93,840, down 0.19% in the past 24 hours. With a market capitalization of $1.86 trillion, supported by a 24-hour trading volume of $50.06 billion, Bitcoin remains a key player in global finance. Its circulating supply stands at 19.8 million BTC, nearing the maximum limit of 21 million coins. Technically, Bitcoin faces immediate resistance at $95,190, with further levels at $96,000 and $98,360. On the downside, critical support lies at $92,100, with deeper protection at $89,610. Trading below its 50 EMA at $94,850 indicates short-term bearish momentum, while the RSI at 48 reflects neutral market conditions. A breakout above $95,190 could signal bullish potential, while a breach below $92,100 risks accelerating declines. Key Insights: Bitcoin Reserves : Swiss proposal targets adding Bitcoin to $1.03 trillion SNB reserves, alongside $27 billion in gold. Market Sentiment : Global Bitcoin interest rises; U.S. and Germany explore similar reserve strategies. Technical Levels : Bitcoin faces resistance at $95,190, with support at $92,100 and RSI at 48.02 signaling consolidation.

The Russian news agency Interfax reports that Russia’s top financial institution , Sberbank, is now a participant in the program, which conducts transactions with digital rubles. The pilot will eventually involve 22 banks. TBank and Tochka Bank also joined with Sberbank, according to Interfax, which reports that the digital ruble is expected to gradually move into widespread use starting in July. Russian President Vladimir Putin greenlit the creation of a CBDC in 2023. Reuters reported earlier this month that the Russian government has also recently taken legislative measures to legalize Bitcoin ( BTC ) mining and other crypto assets, helping Russian firms find ways around sanctions. Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov told the news outlet that more Russian firms would use Bitcoin for international payments in 2025. “As part of the experimental regime, it is possible to use Bitcoins, which we had mined here in Russia (in foreign trade transactions). Such transactions are already occurring. We believe they should be expanded and developed further.” Earlier this month, Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed the US government was undermining the use of the US dollar as a reserve currency, forcing nations to turn to other assets. He cited Bitcoin as the top replacement for the US dollar as a reserve asset, noting that no nation could regulate it. However, Russian authorities also reportedly plan to prohibit cryptocurrency mining in 10 regions and impose seasonal restrictions in three others beginning January 1st, amid growing concerns over energy shortages.

In a lengthy new thread on the social media platform X, crypto software developer Jeffy Yu says that Zerebro ( ZEREBRO ) is building a consumer facing launchpad for AI agents. “We are building Zentients, a consumer facing launchpad for agents… The exact details are still being finalized. But we want to keep the framework simple: Agents will require ZEREBRO for a creation fee and will be launched on a ZEREBRO bonding curve with fees. Once a certain valuation is met by the agent token, the token graduates [and] the liquidity from the bonding curve is deposited and locked into a DEX. Afterwards, traders buy and sell into the live liquidity pool with ZEREBRO.” News of the expansion sent ZEREBRO soaring. The digital asset went from a low of $0.410 on December 30th to its current price of $0.684, a gain of about 66%. Other notable additions planned for Zerebro include a standardized communications protocol for AI agents, web2 capabilities for the agents, decentralized GPU rentals, the ability for individuals to host their own agents, as well as multi-agent intelligence. According to Yu, Zerebro uses a unique financial model where all of its tokens are already in circulation. “ZEREBRO is unique in the sense that all of its tokens are in circulation, so we are not building ‘tokenomics’ in the traditional sense, which governs how tokens are emitted, distributed, and vested over time. Rather, this is a framework for value accrual powered by the Zerebro Stack, which is comprised of three parts: A) Zerebro, our main agent B) ZerePy, our agent framework C) Zentients, our consumer agent launchpad.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Musk shared an image of his laptop with a dollar bill sticker bearing a Dogecoin-dog logo. The post immediately sparked debate about the possible hints Musk could suggest to the crypto community. What is Fueling the Speculation? Notably, George Washington’s face has graced the $1 bill since 1896, but the picture Musk shared is of a Shiba Inu dog breed. According to Musk, the picture has been in his possession for approximately three years as a gift. “This is a pic of my laptop. It’s about 3 years old. A guy in Germany gave me this cool sticker, so I don’t want to upgrade it and lose the sticker,” he wrote. The bill has the inscription “Dogecoin Reserve Note” at the top. This has made many in the community speculate about the possibility of a Dogecoin (DOGE) reserve soon. The speculations stem from Musk’s previous posts that support the memecoin. Dogecoin’s Growing Influence on Musk’s Ties Aside from sharing memes about DOGE, his car manufacturing company, Tesla, accepts DOGE as a payment method for some of its products. Hence, sharing the Dogecoin Reserve Note in a post to his over 209 million followers understandably caused a stir, particularly for crypto enthusiasts. Additionally, Elon Musk’s deliberate choice of portfolio, the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) under Trump’s presidency, further fuels the positive sentiment for DOGE. The department has gained support from notable crypto stakeholders. And, each time his position receives a mention, it directs some attention to the memecoin. Analysts maintain that such a subtle support could drive up market sentiments and trigger a price rally. Interestingly, Musk made a cryptic statement last month, “Starting to feel like ’The DOGE has real potential’ on Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E).” Market Sentiment and Price Impact What Musk might have planned or if DOGE will benefit the incoming administration remains uncertain. However, his attention to the token could push it toward a price rally. As of this writing, DOGE is exchanging hands at $0.3245, a 4.44% increase in the last 24 hours. Its market volume has recorded an uptick of 15.99% to $2.5 billion. The community looks forward to more gains in the days ahead.

Table of Contents The SHIB army faces an uphill battle after daily burn rate skyrockets Why is privacy-focused cryptocurrency 1FUEL set to be the most in-demand altcoin of 2025? The hottest cryptocurrency presale of 2024 is happening right now December has been a disappointing month for the SHIB army, thanks to a steady slide backwards. It’s given up 21.27% since 01 December, meaning the door is open for another altcoin to step into the limelight. With a white hot presale and expected returns in excess of 500% ahead of its public launch, read on to find out why the privacy-focused cryptocurrency 1FUEL is the leading contender for altcoin supremacy in 2025. You might also like: Bonk and WIF to be outshone by new altcoin 1Fuel, say experts The SHIB army faces an uphill battle after daily burn rate skyrockets After a year that has been overwhelmingly positive for the SHIB army, its stringent supporters will no doubt be a little put out that 2024 is ending on a negative note with December looking likely to end in negative territory. The meme coin has been in a downward pattern for much of the month, with the decline starting around the 8 th of the month. SHIB prices were trading strongly around the $0.000034 marker on 08 December but were down to $0.000024 just two days later. SHIB prices fell further on 20 December to a monthly low of $0.000019 . Further hindering SHIB’s ability to recover before 2025 arrives is a massive 972.96% increase in the daily burn rate. This burn, which took place on 29 th December, may well secure SHIB’s return to its all-time-high of $0.000090 in the longer term, but has done little to steady its price losses this month. While this may not be enough to convince the always vocal SHIB army to turn their allegiance elsewhere, it could be enough to push the SHIB whales towards a new altcoin. With its ultra secure crypto wallet and unrivalled one-click, cross-chain transaction technology, 1FUEL is the clear frontrunner. Why is privacy-focused cryptocurrency 1FUEL set to be the most in-demand altcoin of 2025? 1FUEL is currently in stage two of its viral presale and is commanding attention – and investment – from across the crypto industry. Its unique value proposition is founded on advanced levels of privacy and security and an unprecedented solution to the typical cross-chain transaction complexity. Together, these features promise to revolutionise access to the blockchain for millions of underserved and overlooked groups worldwide. At the heart of 1FUEL’s massive investor appeal is its unique technology. Its advanced system, which is partially powered by cutting-edge AI technology, allows users to manage, move and trade their digital assets with a single click across multiple networks. Its technology handles the whole transaction, removing the burden of manual exchanges, swaps and complicated fee structures. This isn’t just a time-saving convenience, it removes the main barriers to adoption that lock millions of people out of digital asset management each year. The unique one-click technology is enormously accessible – more so than anything seen on the blockchain to date. Backed up with an abundance of enhanced security and privacy features – including a temporary secure crypto wallet, a built-in privacy mixer, P2P exchange and accessible cold storage – it’s easy to see why 1FUEL is expected to be a runaway success when it launches publicly. The hottest cryptocurrency presale of 2024 is happening right now 1FUEL’ s cryptocurrency presale is on now, with more than $940,925 raised so far. It is already shaping up to give SHIB and other altcoins serious competition in 2025, with investors flocking to stage 2 of the presale. Experts expect presale returns to exceed 500%, with 100x returns on public launch. Interested investors who join now could also earn staking rewards of up to 30% APR.

The pivot to becoming a major Bitcoin DeFi chain could be a particularly potent narrative, with Bitcoin potentially on the verge of skyrocketing next year should a US-ignited global race to accumulate the asset kick off amongst nation states. However, its not just blockchain upgrades that could support the ADA price going into 2025. The crypto is set to benefit from tailwinds that could send the entire crypto market skyrocketing. Here’s how high the Cardano price could go in 2025. Cardano Price Prediction – Here’s How High It Could Go in 2025 Trump’s election victory last month triggered a stunning rally in crypto markets at the time, as investors anticipate a 180 degree shift in US crypto policy. The current administration and its allies at the SEC , such as Chairman Gary Gensler, have done all they could to stifle and kill innovation in the US crypto industry. By contrast, the incoming Trump administration is full of pro-crypto industry advocates and allies, signaling we are at the cusp of entering a new golden age for crypto in the USA. That’s great for Bitcoin, especially if the US government starts accumulating BTC for a strategic Bitcoin reserve . But it could be even better for altcoins like Cardano, which have been beaten down for years amid US regulatory uncertainty. There is the possibility that Charles Hoskinson might actually end up being a White House advisor, giving all the biggest ADA advocates direct access to President Trump’s ear, and the future is looking good for Cardano in 2025. So, if a bullish breakout is imminent, how high could we see the Cardano price surge? Well, when ADA hit its record highs above $3 back in 2021, it had nearly rallied to its 2.618 Fibonacci extension above its 2018 record highs at $1.30. If it can match this performance in 2025 and hit its 2.618 Fibonacci retracement back from its 2023 lows beyond its 2021 highs, that would imply an ADA price high of around $8. That said, Cardano investors need to be cautious. Cardano’s on-chain metrics need to show some better signs of growth if the crypto is to rally 10x from current levels. Per DeFi Llama , crypto worth only around $440 million is locked in smart contracts on Cardano. That hardly one third of 1% of the total value of all crypto locked in DeFi smart contracts, most of which is on chains like Ethereum and Solana . If Cardano is to maintain its status as a leading altcoin, on-chain adoption needs to accelerate in 2025.

Homosexual Pepe (HOMOPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HOMOPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Homosexual Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homosexual Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Homosexual Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homosexual Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homosexual Pepe by entering its contract address – 92xPeBxtanptFH9AYsRtwRMq7cWWw9GHfxaspwpNvCTP – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMOPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | SHIB | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/homosexual-pepe-homopepe-solana-memecoin-to-rally-18000-ahead-of-exchange-listings-while-shib-bonk-and-doge-crash/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png
38356200,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=635498,1735672501,Magnificent Seven companies carried the US stock market this year,"Wall Street leaned hard on its tech giants this year, with the “Magnificent Seven” carrying the bulk of the stock market’s gains. The S&P 500 soared 23% between January and December 19, and over half of that came from just seven companies. According to Bespoke Investment Group, Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Meta Platforms, and others contributed 13.7 percentage points to the index’s rise. Investors hoped for a broader rally after 2023’s tech-fueled recovery, but it didn’t happen. Nvidia steals the show, but not everyone wins big Nvidia, the year’s crown jewel, surged 175%. The AI giant became the third-best performer in the entire S&P 500, thanks to its dominance in artificial intelligence hardware. Traders couldn’t get enough of Nvidia’s chips, and the company’s stock proved that hype. But not all Magnificent Seven members had a banner year. Microsoft only climbed 14%, underperforming the broader market. And for a moment, it even looked like the Magnificent Seven might lose members. Earlier in 2024, some analysts floated a new “Fab Four” lineup after Tesla, Apple, and Alphabet hit rough patches. Speaking of struggles, Intel had a miserable year. The chipmaker’s stock plunged over 60%, putting it on track for its worst performance ever. Intel ended the year as the second-worst performer in the S&P 500, despite a minor rally in December when it gained 1.2% during midday trading. Profit-taking hit Nvidia late in the year, with the stock dropping 1.3% in December. But even that couldn’t erase its monster gains. The rest of the market wasn’t so lucky. A historic year for the S&P 500 The S&P 500 didn’t just have a good year, it had one of its best ever. The index hit 57 all-time highs through the year, the third-most this century and fifth-most in history. Its 23.8% year-to-date gain followed a 24.2% rally in 2023, its best two-year run since 1997 and 1998. For those doing the math, the late ‘90s comparison isn’t comforting. Back then, stocks gained 31% and 26.7% in consecutive years before adding another 19.5% in 1999. Then the dot-com bubble burst in 2000, wiping out much of the tech sector’s gains. This year, the Nasdaq Composite told a similar story. It outperformed the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500, driven by tech’s unmatched strength. While the Nasdaq kept climbing in December, the Dow slipped over 5%, and the Russell 2000, focused on smaller-cap stocks, tumbled nearly 8%.

In a new interview on the Bankless podcast, hedge fund veteran Anthony Scaramucci says that Bitcoin demand will likely continue to increase, creating a supply crunch that sends the flagship crypto asset soaring. “There’s going to be a supply shock and so there’s no reason why this can’t trade to $200,000 over the next 12 months. You don’t have enough Bitcoin in the marketplace. So what happens? I need to own it. My board just told me I got to get a 1% position. Okay, what do I got to do? I got to go buy a 1% position. You start buying it. It’s liquid. It’s the deepest crypto market. But it’s not super liquid. $10 billion will move that market. It just will.” Scaramucci also predicts that the US government will create a Bitcoin reserve under President-elect Donald Trump’s leadership. “Let me tell you why I think it will happen. Trump wants it to happen, and he’s got the Senate Banking Committee. [Republican US Senator] Tim Scott wants it to happen. He’s going to be the chair of the Senate Banking Committee. [Treasury Secretary nominee Scott] Bessent wants it to happen… If you’re telling me there are no Democrats that are going to vote for that, then I’ll say, Okay, then we’re not going to get it. But I don’t see that… I think there’s a lot of Democrats who will look at it and say, ‘If Bitcoin is digital gold and we have $600 billion of gold on reserve at our bank and the Federal Reserve Bank, you’re telling me we couldn’t put $75 to $100 billion of Bitcoin on reserve? And by the way, you may even liquidate some of that gold to do that. You’re saying that’s not possible?”‘ Bitcoin is trading for $94,737 at time of writing, up 3% in the last 24 hours.

Table of Contents Pepe coin draws attention as analysts predict imminent rebound Brett price dips after surpassing crucial resistance but bullish predictions holds Shiba Inu Price trajectory to ignite stealth SHIB accumulation Pengu coin maintains bullish sentiment after over 500% monthly surge Dogwifhat falls below $3 range, signaling possibility of a bullish reversal Remittix prides itself as the next best PayFi network with a multifaceted ecosystem Can Remittix feature among top altcoin gainers in 2025? The meme coin market is arguably one of the most watched crypto space, and compared to the DeFi market, this sector thrives on community-driven hype. On account of this, investors are highly anticipating the high positivity that would stem from the meme coin space in 2025. Meanwhile, among several strong contenders, Pepe (PEPE) , Brett (BRETT), Shiba Inu (SHIB) , Pudgy Penguins (PENGU), and Dogwifhat (WIF) are signals as top meme coins to watch out for. However, even more anticipated is a new PayFi token called Remittix (RTX) , whose presale is already securing massive attention with nearly $1 million in revenue. You might also like: Ethereum whales are accumulating Shiba Inu and Remittix – here’s why Pepe coin draws attention as analysts predict imminent rebound Pepe coin ranked amongst one of the meme coins with incredible gains in the last bull run, however, the frog-themed token dipped in a consolidating pattern. Currently, Pepe price is down by over 9% in the past month, despite hitting a peak price of $0.00002803 on the 9th of December. Currently in a weekly range of $0.00001722 and $0.00001936, it is clear that Pepe is pricing at lower levels. Besides, technical analysis on TradingView also signifies a neutral signal on its moving average, meaning Pepe coin could rise or fall in the next few weeks. However, Ali Martinez has indicated that the TD sequential presents a buy signal on PEPE’s daily chart which means that it might experience a price rebound soon. Brett price dips after surpassing crucial resistance but bullish predictions holds After surpassing the $0.20 resistance, the price of Brett fell considerably below this mark, into a weekly range of $0.122 and $0.1453. This has disturbed investors’ confidence in the token’s ability for a mega pump in Q1 2025, however, many see this as a brief correction which could result in a price rebound for Brett token later. The current moving averages for the Brett token are also pointing to a sell signal, which indicates that the token is likely to correct further by hitting lower levels. Nevertheless, Brett appears to be preparing for a later surge in 2025 as crypto expert Woody, claimed that Brett price is poised to surpass the $2.618 range. Shiba Inu Price trajectory to ignite stealth SHIB accumulation After falling by 20% in the past month , Shiba Inu token is now pricing under its monthly resistance of 0.00002692. Considering its current undervalued position, Shiba Inu tokens may fall even lower, below the $0.000020 level. However, according to recent news from IBC Group Official, this could be the start of a stealth accumulating phase for Shiba Inu. Whales who are known for long-term holdings are beginning to buy more SHIB tokens as the price dips. Apparently, Shiba Inu token is poised to experience a rebound sooner or later which could further increase its price by 235% to $0.00005816. Pengu coin maintains bullish sentiment after over 500% monthly surge After completing a 550% monthly surge to hit an all-time high of $0.05738, Pudgy Penguins have grown in popularity. Even though Pudgy Penguins only launched a few weeks ago, the Pengu coin has acquired so much positive momentum as it just got listed by Binance, ByBit, OKX, and Bithumb. As a new and bustling meme coin on the Solana ecosystem, Pudgy Penguins is gaining quite the reputation as a top meme coin to anticipate in 2025. Although Pudgy Penguins is currently trading between $0.02628 and $0.04174, Crypto GVR has predicted that the token will hit a target of $0.1 by Q1, 2025. Another top analyst, Wizard of SoHo , has highlighted the strong growth potential of Pudgy Penguins token, saying that it will most likely hit a $10B market cap despite the situation of the crypto market. This has sparked more optimism for Pengu coin to mirror a parabolic rise in 2025. Dogwifhat falls below $3 range, signaling possibility of a bullish reversal As a top meme coin on the Solana network, Dogwifhat have earned its reputation as a strong token with huge potential to join in on the imminent altcoin wave in 2025. However, just like most altcoins, Dogwifhat token is currently consolidating at lower levels as it just dipped by over 41% in the past month . Now, WIF token trades below the crucial $3 resistance level. Dogwifhat is holding up in a weekly range of $1.81 – $2.08, as it fights fluctuations to stay above $2. However, Natalie Dormer has shared some positivity concerning Dogwifhat token, saying that it could reach a short term target of $9 to $10, and a mid-range of $17 to $20 as the bull market continues. Being one of the most watched tokens in the meme coin market, Dogwifhat is primed for a bullish reversal as long as the crypto market continues its bullish cycle in 2025. Remittix prides itself as the next best PayFi network with a multifaceted ecosystem Distinguishing itself from the top meme coins featured above, Remittix is a payment network that utilizes cryptocurrency and blockchain technology to redefine cross-border payments. However, what makes it better than its competitors, like Stripe, Wise, and Coinbase, is that it allows users to convert over 40 cryptocurrencies into fiat and send them directly to global bank accounts.

While Ethereum had a duller year compared to BTC, analysts predict that ETH will make a major breakthrough and surpass BTC in 2025. Steno Research stated in a recent report that they expect Ethereum to overtake Bitcoin and experience a massive rally in 2025. Steno Research analysts based their predictions for ETH on historical trends and Donald Trump's election victory in the US. Analysts also predicted a rally of more than double the current price, stating that they expect the Ethereum price to rise to at least $8,000. Analysts also added that they expect the ETH/BTC ratio to rise from the current 0.0357 to 0.06 in the next 12 months. Steno also stated that they are bullish on Bitcoin, predicting that the BTC price will reach at least $150,000 next year. Steno analysts led by Mads Eberhardt said: “This expectation for Ethereum is based on the argument that Donald Trump’s US presidential victory is more favorable for altcoins than Bitcoin. At this point, we expect Bitcoin's market dominance to drop from the current 58 percent to 45 percent and altcoins to experience a major rally led by ETH.” Ethereum continues to trade at $3,380 at the time of writing. *This is not investment advice.

It crushed every other investment class, climbed to insane heights, and proved once again why it’s king. Starting the year around $40,000, it more than doubled, hitting $108,000 in mid-December. How crazy is that? The launch of Bitcoin ETFs was a big reason behind the surge. These funds made it easier for investors to get in on the action. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) pulled in over $50 billion in 12 months, forcing Bloomberg to dub it the “greatest launch in ETF history.” And Bitcoin wasn’t the only winner. Ethereum ETFs hit the market in July, attracting $2 billion in just six months. Ether itself has gained nearly 50% this year, trading at about $3,400 as of press time. The Trump effect and Bitcoin’s biggest moments The U.S. presidential election was the tipping point. Donald Trump’s win over Kamala Harris lit a fire under Bitcoin. Investors saw Trump’s administration as crypto-friendly, and the market reacted. But the price action wasn’t all smooth sailing. December was rough. Profit-taking hit the market hard, and expectations of very few Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2025 didn’t help. Bitcoin turned red for the month, but even then, its yearly performance outshined everything else. Wall Street wasn’t left behind either. The S&P 500 rose 23% in 2024, while the Dow and Nasdaq set so many new records. AI, strong economic data, and hopes for deregulation drove those gains. Still, Bitcoin dwarfed them all, proving it’s in a league of its own. The April halving reduced block rewards for miners, and the effect was immediate. Mining stocks like Mara Holdings and Riot Platforms struggled, logging double-digit losses for the year. Miners faced tough conditions, with reduced rewards squeezing profits. But not everyone in the crypto space felt the pinch. Companies tied closely to Bitcoin saw massive gains. MicroStrategy, known for holding a ton of Bitcoin, skyrocketed 388% this year. Coinbase rallied 47%, while Robinhood went up an eye-popping 200%. MicroStrategy even got added to the Nasdaq 100 index, proving its Bitcoin bet paid off big, though it’s also ending the year with huge losses. Still, the company bought thousands of more Bitcoins just yesterday.

Meanwhile, BlockDAG (BDAG) is capturing the limelight with its successful presale, accumulating over $174 million and achieving a 2240% rise in value. Its compatibility with both Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and WebAssembly (WASM) increases its attractiveness. What distinguishes it even more? Its Refer & Earn scheme provides immediate USDT rewards, making BlockDAG a notable contender in the current competitive crypto market. BlockDAG: Leading with Technology and Instant USDT Rewards BlockDAG has rapidly ascended as a leading choice among the best altcoins, propelled by its groundbreaking technology and impressive presale results. The initiative has secured over $174 million, resulting in a 2240% value increase to date. More than 17.6 billion BDAG coins have been sold, attracting both group and individual participants. Currently valued at $0.0234 in its 26th batch, BlockDAG's coins are highly sought after, demonstrating confidence in its long-term prospects. Its dual compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and WebAssembly (WASM) allows developers to effortlessly transition or develop decentralized applications. This robust infrastructure is engineered for rapid, scalable transactions, positioning BlockDAG as a future-oriented blockchain platform. A key feature making BlockDAG a compelling choice is its Refer & Earn program, offering immediate cashback rewards in USDT (BEP-20).

BlockDAG's combination of advanced technology, attractive reward programs, and presale success solidifies its status as the best altcoin for those aiming to optimize their returns while engaging with a scalable, future-ready blockchain. Chainlink Advances Amid Expanding Network Chainlink continues to draw interest as it embeds its oracle technology more deeply within the decentralized finance (DeFi) industry. Its recent alliances with entities like Swift and UBS Asset Management showcase Chainlink's role in linking conventional finance with blockchain innovations. The introduction of its Miner Extractable Value (MEV) solution is designed to reclaim profits for DeFi users, establishing Chainlink as a vital player in promoting equity and security within the ecosystem. At present, the Chainlink price stands at approximately $21.10, maintaining strong market interest amid fluctuations. Technically, Chainlink's ecosystem is growing, now including ties with significant initiatives like Aave, which is poised to integrate Chainlink's MEV solution soon. This development, combined with its proven capability to deliver secure, real-world data to blockchains, reinforces its potential for long-term relevance. As the Chainlink price approaches resistance near $23, its network enhancements underscore its escalating importance and utility. Cardano Enhances Scale and Community Engagement Cardano is strengthening its position as a scalable and community-oriented blockchain through recent enhancements. The launch of Hydra, its Layer 2 scaling solution, is set to support up to 100,000 transactions per second, which could lead to wider adoption. A recent Constitutional Convention further emphasized Cardano’s dedication to decentralization, with global representatives refining its governance framework. Current Cardano prediction models anticipate consistent growth, with prospects for the price to climb above the $1 threshold. In crypto trading, ADA is priced around $0.87, encountering resistance yet supported by a robust community. With ongoing upgrades to governance and the development of its smart contract capabilities, Cardano’s reach is extending into the DeFi and NFT markets. The latest Cardano prediction sees a promising trajectory driven by continual innovations and scalability enhancements. The Bottom Line Chainlink’s network expansion, including partnerships with names like Swift and UBS and its focus on MEV solutions, keeps the Chainlink price in focus for market watchers. Meanwhile, updates to Cardano’s Hydra scaling solution and governance mechanisms enhance its standing as a prominent blockchain, with Cardano prediction models showing potential for growth. Amid these updates, BlockDAG distinguishes itself with a presale achievement of over $174 million and a 2240% surge in value. Its compatibility with both Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and WebAssembly (WASM) marks it as a technologically advanced choice among the best altcoins , while the immediate USDT rewards from its referral program offer a unique incentive to engage now.

Despite broader market indecision, with Bitcoin (BTC) struggling to regain upward momentum, Solana’s price action suggests strength in the face of uncertainty. Investors are closely monitoring SOL’s ability to maintain its current levels, as a breakout could set the stage for substantial gains. Related Reading: Cardano Holds Crucial Support At $0.77 – Massive Rally Ahead? Top analyst Ali Martinez recently provided technical insights highlighting Solana’s most significant support zone between $190 and $180. According to Martinez, holding above this range is crucial for SOL to sustain its bullish momentum. A solid defense of this support could attract more buyers, fueling a rally that might propel Solana to retest or surpass its recent highs. However, the entire cryptocurrency market remains on edge as Bitcoin’s struggles continue influencing sentiment across altcoins. For Solana, staying above its key support could be the foundation for a powerful upward move, but losing this zone may trigger a deeper correction. Solana Prepares For A Big Move Solana’s price action has entered a critical phase, suggesting that a significant move is on the horizon. The question remains: will it break higher or face a deeper correction? As the broader cryptocurrency market continues to grapple with uncertainty, Solana’s fate seems tightly linked to Bitcoin’s (BTC) performance, making the coming days crucial for its trajectory. Top analyst Ali Martinez recently shared a detailed technical analysis on X, emphasizing the importance of Solana’s support zone between $190 and $180. This range represents a key demand level that could either pave the way for a bullish surge or serve as a breaking point for a potential retracement. Martinez points out that holding above the $190 mark is essential for maintaining bullish momentum, especially as Bitcoin struggles to confirm its next direction. Solana’s short-term outlook is inextricably tied to Bitcoin’s behavior. If BTC can maintain its current levels or confirm a bullish continuation, Solana could ride the wave higher, potentially reclaiming previous highs and pushing into new territory. However, if Bitcoin falters, Solana might lose its footing and fall below the critical $180 level, opening the door for a steeper correction. Related Reading: Ethereum Stays Within Symmetrical Pattern – Analyst Sets ETH Target Market sentiment remains indecisive as investors weigh the risks and opportunities in the current environment. For Solana, holding above the $190 mark and a stable Bitcoin could be the perfect combination to trigger a rally. Until a clear direction emerges, SOL’s price will likely remain under close scrutiny as traders anticipate the next big move. SOL Holding Strong Amid Uncertainty Solana (SOL) is trading at $194, showing resilience by holding strong above a critical supply zone that has flipped into demand. This strength comes amid widespread market uncertaintyas traders closely monitor key levels to anticipate Solana’s next move. The $190 support zone has emerged as a pivotal area, providing a foundation for potential upward momentum in the coming days. If Solana manages to maintain its position above $190, the next significant challenge lies at the $200 mark. Reclaiming $200 as a support level would be a crucial victory for bulls, signaling renewed confidence in Solana’s price action. This could trigger a swift recovery, with the potential to drive the price toward new all-time highs in the near future. However, the stakes remain high. A failure to break above and establish $200 as a support could leave Solana vulnerable to bearish pressure. In such a scenario, the price might experience a deeper correction, testing lower demand zones and shaking market sentiment further.

Seeing others achieve life-altering returns while feeling left behind is disheartening. Does the fear of missing out make you question if there are still opportunities to succeed in the rapidly evolving crypto space? The uplifting news is that there is hope! By focusing on projects with solid foundations, forward-thinking technology, and practical applications, you can tap into immense potential returns. This guide aims to simplify the complex crypto space and identify the next biggest altcoins for 2025. Top 5 Next Altcoins to Explode in 2025 Here's our list of top altcoins poised for extraordinary returns by 2025: Web3Bay ($3BAY): Revolutionizing E-Commerce via Blockchain Ripple ($XRP): Fast Global Payment Solutions Polkadot ($DOT): Leading in Multi-Chain Technology Chainlink ($LINK): Connecting Smart Contracts to Real Data Dogecoin ($DOGE): From Meme to Crypto Market Leader Now, let's delve into each project to understand what sets them apart and why they should be part of your 2025 portfolio. Web3Bay (3BAY): Revolutionizing E-Commerce via Blockchain Web3Bay is significantly impacting the crypto world by transforming e-commerce through blockchain technology. This decentralized platform facilitates a barrier-free marketplace where buyers and sellers meet without middlemen. Integrating crypto payments with traditional ones like PayPal, Web3Bay is bridging the old Web2 and new Web3 commerce styles. Currently, 3BAY tokens are available at just $0.003 during the presale, rising by 15% in subsequent stages. Early participants could see returns surpassing 500x when the platform reaches full functionality. With 28 presale stages and a limited supply of tokens, Web3Bay presents an early opportunity to back a project set to reshape global commerce. What distinguishes Web3Bay is its combined payment system, decentralized control, and low fees. It offers merchants, especially in developing areas, access to global markets without traditional banking hurdles, placing it among the top altcoins for your attention. Ripple ($XRP): Fast Global Payment Solutions Ripple is at the forefront of transforming global financial systems. Its currency, XRP, enables quick, affordable, and secure international payments favored by banks and financial entities. Ripple’s blockchain completes transactions in 3-5 seconds with minimal fees, vastly surpassing old banking practices. Already collaborating with over 300 institutions like Santander and American Express, and with growing adoption in the $156 trillion international payment market, Ripple stands out as a promising option for both casual and serious participants. Polkadot ($DOT): Leading the Way in Multi-Chain Technology Polkadot tackles a major issue in blockchain technology: interoperability. It enables various blockchains to interact without barriers, creating an environment where decentralized applications (dApps) can prosper. Through its robust security model and adaptable parachains, Polkadot enables developers to craft scalable and secure blockchains for different needs. Its native currency, DOT, is essential for governance, staking, and bonding, promoting a decentralized, community-led ecosystem. As blockchain technology advances, Polkadot's emphasis on scalability and interconnection solidifies its role as one of the next biggest altcoins for sustainable growth. Chainlink ($LINK): Connecting Smart Contracts to the Real World Chainlink has emerged as a pivotal decentralized oracle network, allowing smart contracts to utilize real-world data.

The extradition was confirmed by Montenegro's interior ministry, which stated that Kwon was handed over to U.S. law enforcement and FBI agents with the assistance of Interpol. Kwon is accused of orchestrating a multi-billion dollar crypto asset securities fraud involving the algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD and other crypto assets. The collapse of Terraform Labs in 2022 led to a loss of approximately $40 billion for investors and significantly impacted global cryptocurrency markets. Kwon had been detained in Montenegro since March 2023 after attempting to board a flight with a forged passport. Both the U.S. and South Korea sought his extradition, with the U.S. ultimately succeeding.

38354386,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=376824,1735669182,Bitcoin to Maintain Leadership in 2025 as Sovereign and Institutional Adoption Soars: Franklin Templeton,"Despite the recent pullback in the crypto market, experts suggest Bitcoin will remain the leader in the coming year. The latest Franklin Templeton’s 2025 crypto outlook report, for one, predicted its continued dominance. Bitcoin is expected to solidify its position as a global financial asset, increasingly viewed as a digital store of value. Bitcoin Dominance Forecasted to Strengthen in 2025 The report anticipates sovereign and institutional adoption will drive this trend, with several nations strategically adding Bitcoin to their reserves. The forecast points to BTC’s role as the foundational asset in the digital economy, which is expected to be further accelerated by evolving regulatory landscapes and institutional interest. Looking beyond Bitcoin, the report highlighted significant advancements in the broader crypto ecosystem as well. Regulatory clarity, especially in the US after Donald Trump’s presidential win, is poised to enable more diversified financial products, including exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and tokenized securities, and ultimately represent a major shift towards more mainstream adoption. With a stablecoin regulatory framework expected, major financial institutions are likely to issue their own stablecoins, helping to bridge traditional finance with the burgeoning crypto sector. The growing adoption of tokenized products and stablecoins will fuel decentralized finance (DeFi) growth, expanding the reach of blockchain technology. AI-Crypto Synergy Moreover, decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) are predicted to see rising demand, especially in sectors like logistics and the Internet of Things (IoT), as industries seek more efficient, decentralized solutions. The intersection of AI and crypto will also intensify, with blockchains providing essential transparency and verification for the AI-driven economy. As AI agents leverage blockchain to automate transactions and manage portfolios, the synergy between digital content, social media, and on-chain activity is expected to expand, further reshaping the digital landscape. “Overall, 2025 will mark a shift from speculation to utility, as crypto’s foundational technologies become integral to global financial and operational systems. Stakeholders should watch regulatory developments, institutional moves, and advancements in AI-crypto convergence to navigate this dynamic landscape.” The post Bitcoin to Maintain Leadership in 2025 as Sovereign and Institutional Adoption Soars: Franklin Templeton appeared first on CryptoPotato .",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,,0,0,Crypto Potato,https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-to-maintain-leadership-in-2025-as-sovereign-and-institutional-adoption-soars-franklin-templeton/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/38354386.jpeg

Looking forward, Binance Labs revealed it will keep a close look in three “key areas of focus” while investing. The company posted an announcement on December 31 calling for the year of the Wood Snake, symbolizing growth and creativity. On that note, Binance Labs will soon rebrand and plans to count with Changpeng Zhao ’s (CZ) guidance for its investments. As disclosed, the “key areas of focus” in 2025 will be crypto and blockchain, artificial intelligence (AI), and biotech. “We are also excited to see innovations emerging at the intersection of these three areas,” the fund wrote. Besides the also bullish stance regarding Donald Trump’s crypto-friendly administration in 2025 , Binance Labs commented further on its forecasts for the new year regarding specific crypto narratives and trends. “We anticipate that underperforming sectors like gaming, ZK technologies, and privacy solutions may experience a resurgence as they transition from development to production, enabling new use cases. Further, existing narratives like DeSci, RWAs/Stablecoins, and AI agents should continue to do well with strong momentum, as we are only scratching the surface of what can be achieved.” – Binance Labs Fund Binance Labs Fund 2024 recap Notably, Binance Labs disclosed its year-to-date investment strategy, balancing a fifty-fifty allocation among decentralized applications (DApps) and infrastructure projects. Out of 46 funding deals, decentralized finance (DeFi) led with 10, followed closely by AI and the Bitcoin ( BTC ) ecosystem, with seven deal each. Expanding to other narratives, restaking solutions had four deals and the gaming sector had three. Finally, zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs, real-world assets ( RWA ), and consumer apps had two deals each, closing Binance’s 2024 funding activities. Interestingly, only 14 out of the 46 projects were from the BNB Chain ( BNB ) ecosystem, which Binance is a main stakeholder. This shows an unbiased and chain agnostic approach, which will potentially influence Binance Labs’s rebranding. “We’re always on the lookout for projects that have real-world use cases, strong teams, solid roadmaps, and sustainable business models,” the firm concluded. The announcement also explained that Binance Labs is expanding its scope for investment beyond primary market deals.

However, these forecasts pale in comparison to the bold projections for Lightchain AI (LCAI), a new entrant in the crypto space. Priced at just $0.0041 during its presale , Lightchain AI’s innovative technology and real-world utility are drawing attention, with analysts suggesting it could deliver exponential returns and outshine the giants of the market. Bitcoin and Ethereum Steady Growth in a Maturing Market Bitcoin and Ethereum keep to guide the crypto market, pushed by their set roles and rising big company use. Bitcoins small amount, mixed with its job as online gold, helps its slow rise to $130,000. In the same way, Ethereums power in op͏en money (DeFi) and clever deals backs its predicted jump to $10,000. Yet, when these things get older, their growth path becomes less shaky, attracting cautious buyers. This certainty, while steady leaves space for new, fast-growing projects like Lightchain AI to grab notice with big changes and a lot of promise. Lightchain AI Emerging Force in Blockchain Innovation Lightchain AI has rapidly emerged as a standout project, addressing gaps in the blockchain market by integrating advanced intelligence solutions. Its ecosystem supports the deployment of decentralized applications (dApps) tailored to industries like finance, healthcare, and supply chain management. This focus on real-world impact gives it a competitive edge over more generalized cryptocurrencies. In its presale, Lightchain AI has already raised over $5.7 million, reflecting strong investor confidence. Unlike traditional tokens, LCAI prioritizes industry partnerships and global adoption, ensuring that its platform is not only technically advanced but also widely accessible. Why Lightchain AI Could Outpace Bitcoin and Ethereum in Returns While Bitcoin and Ethereum provide steady growth, Lightchain AI offers the potential for exponential returns due to its early-stage investment opportunity and focus on solving specific industry problems. By creating tools that enable businesses to deploy blockchain-based AI solutions, Lightchain AI positions itself as a leader in decentralized intelligence. Moreover, the platform’s commitment to fostering a collaborative ecosystem and rewarding early adopters sets it apart. With its low presale price, Lightchain AI allows investors to enter at an attractive valuation, maximizing the potential for high returns as the project gains traction. So join the presale and be part of the future of blockchain innovation with Lightchain AI. As the crypto market matures, it’s time to look beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum and seize the opportunities presented by promising projects like Lightchain AI .

Key Points Bitcoin (BTC): User BTC holdings decreased by 8,992 BTC compared to the previous month, falling to 130,936 BTC. Ethereum (ETH): User ETH holdings increased by 85,000 ETH to 1.765 million ETH. Tether (USDT): User USDT holdings have increased significantly, reaching $8.56 billion. This figure equates to $1.91 billion, an increase of 28.79%. The Proof of Reserves initiative is part of OKX’s ongoing commitment to transparency and user trust. It uses cryptographic tools such as Merkle trees and public wallet addresses to verify the platform’s reserves and ensure that user funds are fully backed. OKX has been continuously updating PoR data since November 2022, allowing users and third-party auditors to independently verify solvency. This approach aims to increase trust in the exchange amid increasing regulatory scrutiny and increasing demand for accountability in the crypto industry. The report highlights changing user asset allocations with significant growth in ETH and USDT holdings.

38354182,https://crypto.news/?p=14323741,1735668706,African crypto revolution continues as Ethiopia ranks among global BTC mining leaders,"2024 was a pivotal year for Ethiopia as it generated around $1 billion in BTC mining profits due to its access to cheap, reliable, and renewable energy sources. Africa is a region producing fintech unicorns that provide the highly unbanked (and equally highly “smartphonized”) population and merchants with payment solutions. Companies like TymeBank, Moniepoint, and Opay have made hundreds of millions of dollars by creating and maintaining payment mobile apps and ground touchpoints. In conditions where banks are absent—80% of Africans don’t have bank cards—digital money solutions are filling the void, and cryptocurrency is one of the factors shaping the modern-day financial reality of the continent. You might also like: Chainalysis: Stablecoins represent 40% of crypto economy in Sub-Saharan Africa Ethiopia entered the global BTC mining top According to Intellinews , in 2023, only 35% of Ethiopians had bank accounts. However, this did not block the country from becoming one of the world’s leaders in Bitcoin mining. In 2024, Ethiopia became the first African country with a high-scale state-backed crypto mining operation. Its revenue is expected to reach up to $5.4 billion in 2027. The backbone of Ethiopia’s success in the sector is the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, a gravity dam constructed on the Blue Nile River by 2024. The GERD is one of the 20 largest hydroelectric power plants in the world and the biggest one in Africa. It provides electricity to the entire country and produces enough for export to other nations. Bitcoin critics have often emphasized the excessive energy consumption of the network, noting that many mining operations are based in countries with cheap electricity that rely on dirty fossil fuels. Ethiopia, however, mines bitcoins using cheap and clean energy from the GERD. Interestingly, only half of the Ethiopian population has access to electricity. This means a significant portion of the spare energy can be invested in mining. In 2024, Ethiopia generated $1 billion through Bitcoin mining. The profits made by mining help maintain the GERD infrastructure. According to Happy Coin News, the mining operation accounted for 18% of the country’s annual national income. Bitcoin mining brings in 18% of Ethiopia's revenue thanks to the country using its own GERD hydroelectric power station to mine cryptocurrencies. Read more: https://t.co/qkqiQLwciO — Happy Coin News ☣️ (@happycoinnews) December 28, 2024 In October, Luxor Mining COO Ethan Vera named the key components of Ethiopia’s success in the sector. These include cheap electricity and the use of mid-generation mining devices that consume less power and cost less than newer machines. The main models used in Ethiopia, according to Vera, are Bitmain’s S19J Pro and A1346 by Canaan. The Ethiopian blueprint In 2024, Ethiopia contributed 2.25% of the global hash power in Bitcoin mining. According to Luxor Mining, Ethiopia is the next biggest hash power contributor after the USA, Hong Kong, and Asia. The success of Ethiopia demonstrates that governments can use cryptocurrency to finance infrastructure development and lift local economies. Ethiopia emerged as a Bitcoin mining leader without compromising environmental sustainability. Notably, green mining requires easy access to clean energy while profits are reinvested in the dam’s development, representing a win-win scenario. While Ethiopia was building its mining powerhouse, other countries took note. The Democratic Republic of Congo, for example, is set to build its own clean mining operation in Virunga National Park. Meanwhile, smaller players in other countries are developing local grids to support grassroots mining operations. Initiatives like Gridless and Trojan Mining are also advancing eco-friendly Bitcoin mining efforts in Africa. Ethiopia is paving the way for other African countries to capitalize on renewable energy sources to build Bitcoin mining operations. Similar efforts across the continent could inject vitality into local economies, amplify the ongoing fintech revolution, and open new opportunities for African nations.

With Rollblock , Dogecoin, and Stellar at the forefront, these altcoins show significant growth potential for 2025. As Donald Trump returns as a crypto-supportive president, blockchain projects with strong technology and innovative ideas could soon steal the spotlight from Bitcoin. Rollblock, Dogecoin, and Stellar are among those that have the potential to outperform the OG cryptocurrency. Rollblock – Revolutionizing the $450B Gambling Industry Through Crypto Rollblock project aims to merge the traditional iGaming industry with cutting-edge blockchain technology, pioneering developments in the GambleFi niche. In December, Rollblock saw over $1.3 million in bets placed, with predictions suggesting the casino could double that amount in January. A Fully Licensed and Operational Platform Rollblock is a fully licensed GambleFi platform. The site is licensed by Gaming Anjouan and offers over 7,000 games from more than 10 different gaming providers. The platform also recently introduced sports betting, tapping into major markets like the NBA, NFL, and Formula 1. RBLK – Fueling Rollblock's Ecosystem RBLK is the utility token of the Rollblock ecosystem. Now in its ninth stage of presale, the token is set to deliver substantial returns once it hits the market. Rollblock employs three key strategies to increase its value: ● Revenue Sharing – Rollblock will use up to 30% of its weekly revenue to buy RBLK tokens from the open market.● Token Burn Mechanism – The casino will burn 60% of repurchased tokens.● High-Reward Staking – The 40% of the remaining tokens will be distributed as staking rewards. This approach reduces the token supply while boosting rewards for holders, with more profits being generated each month. “Dogecoin is a Must-Buy for 2025,” Say Analysts Despite navigating a turbulent period caused by the ""DogeReaper"" vulnerability, which led to 69% of Dogecoin nodes crashing, Dogecoin continues to show promise. Trading at $0.3205 with a $46 billion market cap, the coin has a history of strong January rallies, averaging 90% gains. Galaxy Research forecasts that Dogecoin could hit $1 by 2025, achieving a $100 billion market cap. This optimism is fueled by its active community, growing adoption, and potential backing from broader market trends, particularly Bitcoin’s expected rise to $150K by mid-2025. However, Dogecoin’s path to $1 hinges on overcoming market volatility, regulatory challenges, and network recovery. Stellar – $1 Could Be Closer Than Ever Currently trading at around $0.32, Stellar has seen a dip in price since its November highs, but the altcoin still shows strong potential for a rally in 2025. Stellar's solid fundamentals, including partnerships with MoneyGram, Mastercard, and Franklin Templeton, make it a strong contender, particularly in cross-border payments and real-world asset tokenization. Ali Martinez, a top technical analyst, highlights a bullish falling wedge pattern for Stellar, with key resistance levels at $0.45 and $0.50. Ali says that Stellar could soar to $2-3 at the end of 2025. The rally is driven by increased adoption, limited supply, and market dynamics. A breakthrough above $0.45 for Stellar could signal the start of a powerful rally, with some forecasts even suggesting a target price of $5. Is RBLK the Best Token for 2025? While many tokens are expected to experience strong rallies in 2025, RBLK stands out as one of the best options. Rollblock has a unique advantage over Stellar, Dogecoin, and even Bitcoin as it can capitalize on the massive $450 billion gambling ecosystem. As a result, RBLK holders not only stand to benefit from capital gains, but they’ll also share in the GambleFi platform’s profits. Tokens are currently available for just $0.044 and are set to increase over the next few weeks. Discover the Exciting Opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) Presale Today!

Ripple XRP price gained 8%, rising in its trading volume to impressive levels of around $5.4 billion. A new player, 1FUEL is set to become the next-generation crypto wallet to resolve the roadblocks to crypto adoption. Let’s see why experts believe this could be the altcoin to watch for 2025. XRP Price Rises 8%, Experts Predict a Breakout This December, the general cryptocurrency market has been in a consolidation phase. Mostly, this has been due to uncertainty over Federal Reserve cuts in interest rates, favoring a hawkish approach to arrest inflation. Despite its sideways movement, Ripple XRP showed its potential earlier this year when it made a 400% rally. XRP has evolved from the coin that traded between $0.30 and $0.60. This was in the past when it rose and crashed consistently. However, in November, it rose for four weeks straight, and things have been different since then. At the time of writing, XRP trades at $2.07, representing an uptick of 8.29% in 1 month. Its 24-hour trading volume is $5.4 billion, signaling a 121.92% gain. XRP’s partnerships with financial institutions and regulatory clarity have fueled a strong market performance so far in 2024, with the price hitting noteworthy highs this year. However, analysts warn that going into the new year, there could be stagnation as the market for blockchain-based financial solutions becomes more crowded. 1Fuel Set to Make Waves in Cross-Chain Transactions in 2025 While XRP’s growth might level out in 2025, a new altcoin, 1FUEL, is setting itself up as the next-generation crypto wallet to resolve the roadblocks to crypto adoption. The 1FUEL presale has gained traction, raising over $940,000 and selling over 99 million tokens as stage 3 beckons. Unlike XRP which is mainly focused on transactions, 1FUEL integrates cutting-edge tools with artificial intelligence to power digital asset management. With innovation at the core, 1FUEL is a new altcoin in a league of its own. This privacy-focused wallet approaches cross-chain transactions differently with AI tools that enable 1-click cross-chain transactions. Moreover, artificial intelligence monitors the network automatically to provide insights into network congestion and eliminate irregular transaction fees. As the 3rd stage of presale beckons, savvy investors are following the situation and participating at a low price point of $0.012. Analysts project massive returns of up to 500x on public launch. Users want a safe wallet to handle on-chain transactions, but 1fuel takes things up a notch by securing transactions with built-in mixer technology and disposable wallets. With the increase in wallet watching, these ensure anonymous transactions. 1Fuel offers a cold storage solution to store assets offline. This adds a layer of protection from breaches and hacks. Moreover, 1FUEL incentivizes token holders with staking rewards of up to 30% APR. Conclusion Ripple XRP gained 8%, rising in its trading volume to impressive levels, while 1fuel is setting itself up as the next-generation crypto wallet to resolve the roadblocks to crypto adoption. The 1FUEL presale allows savvy investors to get in on the altcoin to watch for 2025. Join the presale to lock yourself in position for mind-blowing returns.

Despite a brief recovery earlier this month, SHIB has struggled to maintain upward momentum, reflecting a bearish shift in market sentiment. Yet, just as SHIB’s tanking value sends panic across the meme coin investing sector, a new altcoin called PropiChain (PCHAIN) is capturing the attention of the broader crypto community with its impressive 32,190% growth potential. Shiba Inu Price Faces Downward Pressure Amid Market Volatility The Shiba Inu price has been on a downward trajectory, with a 0.55% decrease over the past day, a 3.63% increase over the week, and a 14.70% decline over the month. Unsurprisingly, this volatility has left investors uncertain about SHIB’s future performance. While market analysts have observed that SHIB’s price has been forming a possible ascending channel on its daily chart since late September 2024, the recent drop to $0.00002209 has raised concerns about the sustainability of this pattern. Recent analysis indicates that SHIB is struggling to find support below key levels. However, experts say it’s the greater shift in market sentiment from meme coins to utility altcoins along with the broader crypto market decline, as evidenced by the sharp drop in the Bitcoin price from $108k to $94k, that’s driving the Shiba Inu price downwards. This has led to a renewed search for the best altcoins to buy now , considering how Trump’s inauguration three weeks from now could spark another massive bull run. Why PropiChain (PCHAIN) Can Outperform the Crypto Market By Q1 2025 As the Shiba Inu price struggles with a sharp price decline, a growing wave of investors are turning to PropiChain (PCHAIN), with nearly $2 million already spent weeks into its presale . However, PCHAIN is more than just another speculative altcoin; it’s the driving force behind an innovative real estate solutions platform that combines blockchain, real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, metaverse integration, AI-driven insights, and smart contracts. Firstly, PropiChain (PCHAIN) is rewriting the rules of real estate by offering unprecedented access through fractional ownership. With PropiChain, assets can be transacted in unlimited fractions, meaning an investor can take as little as $100 and purchase fractional shares of premium, multi-million-dollar properties worldwide. Secondly, by digitizing physical properties, PropiChain is accelerating property transactions to near-instant speeds, bringing liquidity to an otherwise illiquid sector. Yet, it only gets more exciting with the introduction of PropiChain’s metaverse marketplace , which amplifies global reach and enables users to explore, trade, and manage real estate assets seamlessly across borders. With tokenization, transactions, and storage features, PropiChain positions itself as the leading Web3 real estate trading hub. However, another feature that truly sets PropiChain miles apart is its cutting-edge AI technology, which offers real-time property valuations, trend predictions, and automated trading features for investors. PropiChain’s smart contracts further enhance efficiency by automating time-consuming, expensive, and repetitive tasks such as leasing agreements, rent collection, and renewals. Combined with its blockchain-based security, which eliminates fraud and ensures transaction transparency, PropiChain (PCHAIN) is raising trust standards in an industry losing billions of dollars annually due to occupation fraud. SHIB vs PCHAIN: 2025 PropiChain and Shiba Inu Price Predictions For SHIB holders grappling with a significant Shiba Inu price slump, the PropiChain presale is a welcome development considering how PCHAIN is dominating conversations in the crypto world with an astonishing 32,190% return for early investors . Combining blockchain, metaverse AI, smart contracts, and real-world utility, it’s quickly emerging as a top contender in the altcoin space, providing an irresistible opportunity for those looking for the best cryptos to buy now. Investors Flock Round Two of PropiChain Presale, Anticipating 32,190% ROI While the Shiba Inu price struggles to maintain momentum, PropiChain is forging ahead as the most promising crypto presale of this bull cycle. Currently priced at just $0.011 in round two, PCHAIN is a golden opportunity that investors are racing to secure as the price will never be this low again. PropiChain’s bold vision for revolutionizing the real estate market has captivated analysts, who foresee it commanding a significant share of this trillion-dollar industry. The project’s integration of tokenization, AI, and smart contracts positions it as a frontrunner for massive adoption, with the potential to mint millionaires in 2025. With nearly $2 million already raised, investors are showing their unwillingness to miss PropiChain (PCHAIN) presale . Yet, more compelling are the maths which show that a modest $865 round-two investment today could soar 32,190%, yielding an eye-popping $279,308 by Q1 2025. This momentum is further fueled by recent milestones, including the presale raising $2 million in record time combined with the successful BlockAudit security audit and PropiChain’s highly anticipated listing on CoinMarketCap . However, this also means time is of the essence, as demand is driving the presale closer to its conclusion. The crypto market rarely offers second chances. Yet, investors who regret missing out on the early Shiba Inu price boom now have a chance to capture life-changing returns with PropiChain.

Marc Andreessen sparks the AI agent rally Before there was VIRTUALS, LUNA and FART, there was GOAT, the memecoin inspired by creator Andy Ayrey’s experiment which pitted two Claude AI models in an endless chatter .

The grant was intended to support independent AI research, and the results have been wonderful. However, I have nothing to do with the… — Marc Andreessen 🇺🇸 (@pmarca) October 16, 2024 With that, “AI agents on blockchains” was cemented as a go-to bullish talking point, gripping the imaginations of Crypto Twitter like never before . 12-year-old rugs memecoin Attention is the currency of memecoins, and in this case, the rugpull was the catalyst. In this ironic twist of fate, a 12-year-old middle schooler launched the QUANT memecoin on a live stream, dumped his tokens for a $30k profit and jubilantly flipped off the camera. The virality of the moment proceeded to pump QUANT to an $84 million market cap in the next two hours, leaving our young comrade with at least $4 million in missed profits. The SEC’s fake bitcoin ETF approval tweet It was a publicity stunt straight off a Hollywood script when the SEC’s official Twitter account was hacked on Jan. 10, 2024 and posted a false announcement of the approval of bitcoin ETFs. Bitcoin’s price saw a thousand dollar pump before Gensler officially clarified that its account was compromised. The @SECGov twitter account was compromised, and an unauthorized tweet was posted. The SEC has not approved the listing and trading of spot bitcoin exchange-traded products. — Gary Gensler (@GaryGensler) January 9, 2024 In October, the hacker turned out to be a 25-year-old American who deployed a “ SIM swap ” technique using an SEC employee’s personal details. Shortly after the SEC account hack, the bitcoin ETFs was then actually officially approved , ushering in crypto’s first ever market pump before the Bitcoin halving. Never a dull day in crypto. Ansem vs. BitBoy for Crypto Fight Night A number of things had to happen for this fight to take place. Someone had to propose the ridiculous idea of pitting two men — who had absolutely no business being in the ring — against each other in a boxing match. That idea had to evolve into selecting and inviting two of crypto’s most hateable KOLs, and a lot of money had to be spent to make it happen. Kudos to whoever executed that BD miracle — even Dana White would’ve been proud. The fight concluded in a lackluster draw, but Bitboy’s use of a much-needed inhaler post-match will forever hold a place in the venerable hall of fame of crypto memes. SLERF memecoin creator accidentally burns investor money What could possibly go wrong with a memecoin investment which involves sending money to an anonymous stranger’s wallet on the internet? After developer Slerfsol raised an eye-popping $10 million for the SLERF memecoin, he then accidentally sends $10 million worth of the token supply meant for investors to a burn address, irreversibly destroying it. “Guys I fucked up. I burned the LP and the tokens that were set aside for the airdrop. Mint authority is already revoked so I can not mint them. There is nothing I can do to fix this. I am so fucking sorry,” Slerfsol tweeted, before jumping on a Twitter Space to apologise profusely amid tears. But scarcity is good… right? Like QUANT, the hilarity of the moment ironically sent SLERF to a $450 million market cap. Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

This small, self-proclaimed libertarian state, wedged between Croatia and Serbia, is about to choose its next set of leaders. The elections will fill the seats of the Congress, Liberland’s governing body, which makes the laws, policies, and fiscal decisions for the nation. What’s different here is that the entire voting process is on the blockchain. No physical ballots, no middlemen. Just decentralized, tamper-proof voting. The candidates running for Congress The candidates are as unconventional as the election itself. Justin Sun, Liberland’s Prime Minister and the co-founder of TRON blockchain, is on the ballot. Justin says his focus is on running a minimalist government. “Our success can inspire other nations to embrace libertarian principles, demonstrating that a minimalist government can bring stability and prosperity without excessive regulation or coercion. By upholding this approach, we will further Liberland’s status as a beacon of freedom and individual autonomy,” he said. Evan Luthra, Liberland’s IT Minister and entrepreneur, is another candidate. Evan claims he plans to overhaul Liberland’s digital systems. “Liberland is for people who believe freedom is a fundamental right,” he said. He’s pushing for streamlined services that “actually work.” Then there’s Karnika E. Yashwant, also known as Mr. KEY. A blockchain veteran with over a decade of experience, his campaign promises are quite specific: easier citizenship processes, better communication with residents, and putting Liberland on the map. “Liberland is a movement for freedom, choice, and innovation. My candidacy is grounded in actionable solutions that position Liberland as a trailblazer for liberty-driven governance,” he said, adding that: “Liberland is freedom in its purest form. But let’s face it: We’ve got the ideas, but we need structure. We’ve got the talent, but we need action.” Then Samuela Davidova, the Press Secretary of Liberland. She said, “As a candidate for Congress, my focus is clear: streamline foreign relations, empower citizens, and deliver real, tangible benefits. No reinventing the wheel. Let’s amplify what works and eliminate unnecessary obstacles.” A day before the election, on January 3, an online debate will take place. It’ll reportedly be a chance for citizens to hear directly from all 15 candidates. Each gets five minutes to introduce themselves, followed by questions from moderators and Cabinet members. The debate is open to the public via Zoom. Liberland’s Congress currently has seven members, and the election will determine its next lineup. Each term lasts only three months, reportedly to keep the government fast-moving and adaptable.

According to new data from whale-tracking platform Whale Alert, an ancient BTC address that has been inactive for a decade has risen from its slumber to shift around 357 BTC worth $34,070,177. “A dormant address containing 357 BTC ($34,070,177) has just been activated after 11.0 years!” Data from blockchain tracker BitInfoCharts shows the wallet profited a staggering $33.7 million, or 10,150%, from the price of Bitcoin rising. BitInfoCharts also shows that the wallet hasn’t been active since January 2014. At that time, the crypto king was valued at just $862. The data also shows that the address was sent small amounts of BTC numerous times throughout its existence. Earlier this month, BitInfoCharts found that long-dormant crypto whale wallets were receiving trace amounts of BTC likely due to dusting attacks. Dusting attacks occur when bad actors send small amounts of crypto to addresses as a means of invading their privacy, tracking the transactional data from them to identify the individuals or companies behind them.

38353401,https://thecoinrise.com/switzerland-eyes-bitcoin-on-national-balance-sheet/,1735666873,Switzerland Eyes Bitcoin on National Balance Sheet,"Switzerland, long known for its forward-thinking approach to finance and technology, is now considering an audacious Bitcoin proposal. The country plans to add Bitcoin (BTC) to its national reserves. Giw Zanganeh, Vice President of Energy and Mining at Tether, spearheads this initiative . The proposal could lead to a historic shift in Switzerland’s financial landscape if successful. It could have significant implications for the Swiss financial system and the broader cryptocurrency world. The Vision: A Bitcoin-Fueled Swiss National Bank Zanganeh’s plan proposes changing Switzerland’s constitution to allow Bitcoin to be part of the Swiss National Bank’s (SNB) reserves. The SNB currently diversifies its reserves across various fiat currencies and gold. The bank has always seen gold as a safe investment, so it holds over 1,000 tonnes of it. The country’s constitution, Article 99, Clause 3, mandates that part of its reserves must be held in gold. Zanganeh’s initiative proposes a small yet powerful change to this article, adding just a few words to allow Bitcoin as a reserve asset. This inclusion would mirror the growing global interest in Bitcoin as a store of value and financial hedge. It could position Switzerland at the forefront of digital currency adoption at a national level. Meanwhile, making Bitcoin part of Switzerland’s National Bank reserves won’t be easy. The proposal needs to collect 100,000 signatures from Swiss citizens by June 30. If it does, it will be reviewed by the Swiss Federal Assembly. For this to happen, the proposal will need support from the public and political leaders in Switzerland. A Previous Attempt and the Global Shift Toward Bitcoin This is not the first time Switzerland has entertained the idea of integrating Bitcoin into its financial framework. 2B4CH, a crypto initiative group, tried a similar plan in October 2021, but it didn’t get enough support. Since then, the landscape has shifted dramatically. The incoming U.S. government has also teased creating a Bitcoin reserve. Despite the ongoing controversy surrounding the idea , other countries are looking into it too. Recently, Christian Lindner, the former German finance minister, has suggested adding Bitcoin to Germany’s reserves. This also includes the European Central Bank’s reserves and those of Russia and Canada. Switzerland’s Crypto-Friendly Legacy Switzerland has long been a haven for crypto firms and investors . The country is prominent for its progressive stance on digital currencies. It has provided a welcoming environment for blockchain innovation. Zug, one of Switzerland’s cantons, started experimenting with Bitcoin payments in 2016. This was years before the digital asset gained mainstream popularity. This new plan continues Switzerland’s crypto-friendly tradition, pushing for a new way to achieve financial stability.

Franklin Templeton Digital Assets first wrote that he expects a bright outlook for cryptocurrencies in 2025. Franklin analysts noted that by 2025, cryptocurrencies will see significant advances shaped by regulatory clarity, institutional adoption, and technological evolution. According to the report, analysts listed their expectations as follows: “We believe that in 2025, U.S. regulators such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will approve more diversified crypto-related financial or investment products, such as more crypto ETFs or tokenized security products. Favorable regulations will allow the United States to reestablish itself as a global hub for crypto innovation. We will see large TradFi companies enter the crypto space. A stablecoin regulatory framework is expected in the US. This will open the doors for large financial institutions to issue their own stablecoins. Bitcoin will solidify its position as a global financial asset that acts as a digital store of value, accelerated by sovereign and institutional adoption. We expect strategic BTC reserves to be added by several countries. We will see the convergence of AI and cryptocurrencies accelerate, with blockchains providing transparency and verification that will be crucial to expanding the AI-driven economy.” *This is not investment advice.

38353006,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=376814,1735666384,Here’s Why Ripple (XRP) Could be Poised for a ‘Big Price Movement’,"TL;DR XRP is up 230% YTD, with analysts pointing to tightening Bollinger Bands and similarities to 2017’s pre-bull run patterns as signs of a possible further rally. Some market observers suggest the price could hit $4 or even much higher, supported by declining exchange holdings, which reduce the immediate selling pressure. Major XRP Rally on the Way? Ripple’s XRP has been among the worst-performing leading cryptocurrencies in the past seven days. On December 30, it briefly tumbled under $2 before it recovered some losses to the current $2.07 (per CoinGecko’s data). XRP Price, Source: CoinGecko Despite the bearish outlook in the last week, 2024 has been highly successful for XRP. Recall that it was worth around $0.62 at the start of the year, meaning it has experienced a 230% price increase since then. Multiple analysts believe it has much more room for growth. One of those is Ali Martinez, who claimed that the Bollinger Bands on the token’s price chart have been squeezing lately, indicating a “big movement” underway. This technical indicator, developed by John Bollinger in the early 1980s, assists traders in detecting when an asset may be overbought or oversold and spot potential price breakouts or reversals. Tightening the bands means XRP has experienced relatively low volatility for a prolonged time and might be headed for a huge rally (or correction). JAVON MARKS remains an optimist and suggested that XRP’s current price condition looks very similar to what transpired in 2017 (shortly before the bull run that took it to a new all-time high of over $3.4). “Prices right now may only be getting ready to come out of an ‘Intermission Phase’ before yet another ‘groundbreaking’ bullish rally! It may be time to strap in,” the X user assumed. Previous Predictions Other market observers who have set bullish targets for Ripple’s native token include Mikybull Crypto and Coach, JV. The former expects a rise to a new peak of $4, whereas the latter thinks that XRP would be one of those cryptocurrencies that investors will regret not buying at current rates: “XRP will be one of these assets where people will say, “I could have bought XRP at $2, $5, or $7, and will FOMO in at $100.” The beauty in this. Everyone will win in the long run! It’s the short-term mindset that destroys portfolios!” Meanwhile, the amount of XRP stored on exchanges has been declining in the past week. This suggests a shift from centralized platforms towards private wallets and could be considered bullish since it reduces the immediate selling pressure.

United States policymakers and our allies focus too narrowly on macroeconomic tools like sanctions and promoting the dollar as a reserve currency when the modern front is evolving. Today, the real battles are being waged on smartphones and in the global currency markets.  China is waging a multi-decade plan to displace the United States' greatest asset: the dollar. The dollar is critical to the United States' economic and geopolitical power as the global reserve currency. Without it, our influence would weaken, and our debt would become a bigger problem. This is precisely what the Chinese Communist Party and the Kremlin want.  China and Russia have shed billions of dollars worth of U.S. Treasury holdings while growing their stockpiles of gold. Our sanctions, designed to separate countries from the ""Western"" economic system, are no longer enough of a deterrent for those who can control financial activity within their borders and project their power outward.  Authoritarian adversaries — including China, Iran and Russia — are actively building parallel cross-border economic systems that will pull into their orbits not only neighboring countries but also our allies who trade heavily with them.  For example, over half of businesses in Japan accept Alipay, while more than one-third accept WeChat Pay. This distribution gives two Chinese firms unprecedented visibility into the individual market transactions of Japanese consumers and businesses. It could allow China to disrupt Japan’s economy should tensions escalate, such as in a potential conflict over Taiwan.  How the U.S. can respond  China sees financial technology and cryptocurrency as tools to extend its financial power and surveillance globally. The United States must respond in two ways: export our financial technology and systems worldwide and embrace bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset instead of stifling innovation.  Lawmakers and politicians on both sides of the aisle, most notably President-elect Donald Trump, recognize the power of holding bitcoin on the nation’s balance sheet as a hedge against inflation. This direction would also strengthen U.S. resilience against economic challenges posed by China’s financial strategies.  The Federal Reserve, like many central banks, holds a diverse portfolio of reserve assets. As of 2024, this includes approximately $35 billion in foreign currencies and $11 billion in gold stock. These holdings demonstrate America’s economic strength and provide liquidity during financial stress. However, in our rapidly digitizing world, the absence of a native digital asset in this portfolio is becoming increasingly conspicuous.  With its global reach and growing adoption, bitcoin is the ideal candidate to fill this gap. Often called “digital gold,” bitcoin is a scarce commodity. The U.S. is the largest nation-state holder of bitcoin, having seized 210,000 coins from illegal actors. This gives the U.S. a first-mover advantage and could secure our economic future.  Critics may argue that bitcoin's volatility makes it unsuitable as a reserve asset. However, this volatility will likely decrease as adoption grows and the market matures. In 2021, El Salvador recognized bitcoin as legal tender and began purchasing it as a treasury reserve asset. They have seen a 100% increase in value and have no intention of selling.  A multi-front war  The U.S. must recognize we are already in a multi-front war with China. One of these fronts is financial services, and crypto is a weapon in our arsenal. Losing this battle means global financial services and individual financial activity would be dominated by adversarial states focused on control, surveillance and dominance — and a continued attack on our currency.  Trump understands this, telling Bloomberg in July, “If we don’t do it, China is going to pick [bitcoin] up.”  Projecting American financial power also requires the government to empower, enable and encourage our private economic sector to interact with contested economies throughout the Indo-Pacific and beyond. Expanding the use of our payment systems, banks and dollars — even where it’s controversial — is essential.  Right now, our adversaries are winning because we aren't even playing. They are exporting their systems, institutions and surveillance tools worldwide. Meanwhile, we’ve done little as TikTok, a serious threat to our national security, captivates an entire generation of Americans. We must do the same with financial technology because no disruption would be greater to our enemies.  The U.S. should more explicitly weaponize financial technology and crypto. For example, we should endorse decentralized financial technology that enables citizens of hostile governments like Iran to use smartphones to access USD-based stablecoins and payment services, in order to begin separating their economic activity from their government’s control. At its core, power is about control — not just of police or national security but of resources and economies.  The world is at a financial crossroads. The question isn’t whether digital currencies will shape the future but how we will adapt to this new reality. The U.S. can shape this future by embracing bitcoin as a reserve asset. The time for bold action is now, and the benefits for global financial stability and innovation could be profound.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Zac Townsend ,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/12/30/why-a-u-s-bitcoin-strategic-reserve-is-vital-to-fending-off-china,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/15e4b3720587624d3bb4e5dc46e015ca99dd5b06-6000x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The catch here is that not all coins will perform well, only the ones with solid utilities and potential, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Avalanche (AVAX) and 1FUEL, etc., will take the front seat during the altcoin season. Although SHIB and AVAX have launched already and are well established, 1FUEL is still in its presale and is already gaining traction. Continue reading to see the unique features these projects are offering in the DeFi space and why they are projected to achieve massive numbers. SHIB: The Community-Driven Token SHIB, inspired by the viral Shiba Inu dog breed, is a meme coin often seen as an alternative to Dogecoin. Its strong community, known as the “Shib Army,” plays a significant role in its ecosystem. Recently, Shiba Inu (SHIB) announced plans to launch the TREAT token while continuing to expand its metaverse. This metaverse development boosts SHIB’s future potential and fosters community engagement. Adding the token could strengthen the ecosystem’s foundation and draw in more users. However, it is still in development, with no release date confirmed yet. With these ongoing developments, SHIB is expected to play a significant role in shaping the altcoin season as 2025 approaches. AVAX: The High-Performance, Scalable Blockchain for Decentralized Applications and Custom Networks Avalanche (AVAX) is a decentralized, open-source Layer-1 blockchain platform popularly known for its high throughput, low latency, and scalability. Being the 11th largest cryptocurrency by market cap, AVAX kicked off 2024 with momentum, reaching a peak of $65.39 in March. Currently trading at $36, it shows signs of potential for a breakout by year-end. On Monday, the 16th of December 2024, Avalanche (AVAX) announced its launch of Avalanche9000 on its mainnet. This is a major upgrade that will cut deployment costs for Layer-1 blockchain networks by 99.9%. The ACP-77 upgrade brings major changes to validator operations, allowing developers to launch their production Layer-1s without the limitations of project size, thanks to a newly introduced, cost-effective structure. AVAX is favored by blockchain developers and is considered one of the best altcoins to buy. Following the recent launch, crypto analysts are predicting AVAX to hit $70. No doubt this could potentially shape the altcoin season. 1FUEL: The Most Comprehensive and User-Friendly Wallet Available 1FUEL is the newest solution that simplifies cryptocurrency access by eliminating technical barriers. Its wallet automates complex processes, offering a high level of security and privacy. This will empower users both newbies and experts to engage with digital assets and transact with confidence. This all-in-one altcoin will transform cross-chain transactions by offering a single-click solution that eliminates the need to navigate between several blockchain networks. This way, you won’t have to worry about the complexity of having multiple coins in a wallet to transact in each chain and the possibility of making a wrong transaction. Going by this, 1FUEL will be the one-stop solution for seamless transactions across networks. Conclusion SHIB and AVAX have become established tokens driving blockchain innovation. With ongoing developments, market sentiment remains bullish, and analysts are optimistic for 2025 and beyond. On the other hand, investors are confident that 1FUEL is committed to making a positive impact and a seamless interaction for everyone from novice investors to experienced traders and institutional participants. Its presale is currently ongoing with the price at $0.012 and is projected to skyrocket 100x by 2025.

The token welcomes the new year with grand ambitions and expectations. Memecoins have seen tremendous growth over the past year, awarding investors handsomely. Husky Inu (HINU), one of the newest memecoins to grace the crypto world, is ready to welcome 2025 and expects immense growth this year. The project is currently in its second presale round, which has generated over $690,000 since launching. Another Winner from the Solana Network: Husky Inu (HINU) Husky Inu is the latest memecoin to join the Solana blockchain. Affectionately known as Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) new best friend, Husky Inu, was created to bring its holders more utility and value by leveraging the power of Solana. Husky Inu and its native token, HINU, aim to disrupt the memecoin industry by building a supportive community boasting innovative features and improved rewards. The project recently launched the presale for its native token, HINU and is doing immensely well. Since going live, the presale has generated over $690,000. Husky Inu is working on exciting things, including an Earn App and a Decentralized Exchange. According to the platform, the Earn App will reward users for engaging with the platform and completing simple tasks such as liking, sharing and reposting content. On the other hand, the DEX will facilitate decentralized trading to improve utility and value for HINU token holders. Husky Inu owes its stand-out presale performance to some fantastic features. The project is committed to a reliable token ecosystem through a carefully designed distribution model and a capped maximum supply to ensure scarcity and value. The project has capped its total supply to 100 billion tokens and boasts a unique deflationary supply element. The deflationary aspect means that 50% of all platform fees collected from the upcoming Husky Inu Exchange and DEX will be used to buy and then burn $HINU tokens and, in such a way, reduce the circulating HINU supply. What Makes Husky Inu (HINU) a Good Buy? It is clear to see why the memecoin sector attracts the attention it does. Often, these projects enter the crypto sphere motivated purely by speculation and fun, but specific tokens stand out for their ability to move beyond their reputation.

BTC surpassed $100,000 for the first time in its history, breaking new records, thanks to the growing interest from institutions and Donald Trump's victory in November. While Bitcoin is running from record to record with supportive winds, altcoins still haven't met expectations. At this point, while many investors are waiting for losses in altcoins they bought at high prices, the great expectation of an altcoin rally in 2025 continues to be a hope for closing the losses. How Is Bitcoin Performing in the New Years? As is known, BTC's trading adventure on exchanges does not date back very far. Even on major exchanges such as Binance, Bitcoin, which started trading in 2017, does not have many anniversaries to compare it with. Although Bitcoin started to be traded on some exchanges in 2014, we will not take it into account in this review as we think it will not shed light on today due to the low trading volume in those years. Year 2021-2022 Year 2022-2023 Year 2023-2024 As can be seen, a general upward movement was observed in Bitcoin after the new year anniversaries. As a result; Bitcoin tends to show an upward movement on anniversaries. Of course, the fact that it has acted this way before does not mean that it will happen again. While it remains unclear how Bitcoin will greet the year 2025, one thing we do understand is that “Bitcoin loves new years.” *This is not investment advice.

Pepe ( PEPE ), the third-biggest meme coin, climbed to a high of $0.000022, its highest level since Dec. 18. The rebound came after Elon Musk, the wealthiest person in the world, updated his X profile picture to a Pepe-like image. Musk, one of the most influential people globally, has over 234 million followers on X, close ties with Donald Trump, and a fortune of nearly half a trillion dollars .

One word: Doge — Kekius Maximus (@elonmusk) December 20, 2020 Pepe has experienced remarkable growth since its inception in 2023, with its market cap soaring from near zero to a peak of over $10 billion earlier this month. The token has surged by nearly 1,500% in the past year, ranking it among the best-performing meme coins. Pepe has created significant wealth for many investors. According to IntoTheBlock, 70% of all holders, or about 178,000 people, are in profit, while 24% have incurred losses. The remaining investors are at breakeven. Pepe breakeven price | Source: IntoTheBlock Pepe Coin price analysis Pepe price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that Pepe coin price peaked at $0.00002833 earlier this month before pulling back. It bottomed at $0.0000145, which coincides with the 50% Fibonacci Retracement point, and formed a hammer pattern. This pattern, characterized by a small body and a long lower shadow, is often a bullish signal. Pepe has now climbed above the key resistance level of $0.00001950, its highest swing on Dec. 24. It is also trading above the 200-day and 100-day moving averages. Given these bullish indicators, Pepe is likely to continue rising, with bulls targeting the year-to-date high of $0.00002833, which represents about a 33% upside from the current level. Potential catalysts for further gains include Donald Trump’s upcoming swearing-in and the expected FTX distributions . Some of the $16 billion from the distributions may be reinvested into cryptocurrencies, potentially boosting Pepe.

38352086,https://finbold.com/?p=224678,1735664537,Short squeeze alert for January 2025: Two cryptocurrencies with potential to skyrocket,"The wider cryptocurrency market has retraced downward after December 17 saw Bitcoin ( BTC ) reach a new all-time high (ATH) price of approximately $106,490. Following the high, the price of BTC retreated to roughly $94,000, before a failed retesting of the $100,000 mark. Prices subsequently crashed below $93,000 but had recovered to $95,256 by press time, with year-to-date (YTD) returns at 126.67%. While broad consensus states that this is just a temporary consolidation period before the market-wide rally continues, even temporary drops have a way of intensifying bearish sentiment. With short sellers having reaped significant rewards from this latest move to the downside, they have doubled down on their bets — in a move that leaves space for potential short squeezes. To identify potential short-squeeze opportunities for January 2025, Finbold retrieved derivatives data from CoinGlass to select two cryptocurrencies that both exhibit high short volume and possess the potential for significant price appreciation. A look at the data identified two promising candidates Aave ( AAVE ) and Hyperliquid ( HYPE ), both of which are well-established digital assets with significant market capitalizations. HYPE and AAVE long & short ratio. Source: CoinGlass Short volume for AAVE and HYPE is beginning to surge Whereas some $140.63 million in long positions was opened in AAVE, $153.02 million was placed in short orders. At present, 52.11% of the daily open interest is on the short side. Although Hyperliquid’s daily open interest is a tad less bearish, with 51.40% in favor of the short side, the total volume is significantly greater. In the last 24 hours, $424.17 million worth of HYPE shorts have been placed, whereas $401.14 million has been used to open long positions. While this is generally lower than what is required for a short squeeze, if the pace continues, the open interest on both assets could swing even more to the bearish side by the end of January. Readers should note that there is no guarantee that a short squeeze will happen with these cryptocurrencies. While the bears have a slight edge at present, a short squeeze requires a rapid and powerful pivot from bearish to bullish sentiment, with plenty of open positions in the previous direction. However, with that being said, these are the two assets that experienced the most bearish shifts over the last 24 hours. If the pace continues into January, a lot of capital could be at risk. Both AAVE and HYPE are likely going to benefit from platform improvements in 2025 — HYPE staking went live on December 30, providing a massive bullish catalyst for the asset, and the highly-anticipated launch of Aave V4, slated for early 2025 , will doubtlessly do the same for AAVE.

South Korea Seeks Arrest Of President Yoon According to Reuters , the country’s Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials confirmed that Seoul Western District Court approved the arrest warrant Tuesday over his short-lived declaration of martial law on December 3. WATCH: A South Korean court approved the arrest of impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol over his short-lived imposition of martial law. An arrest warrant for an incumbent president is unprecedented in the country https://t.co/oXRZ0xtSP0 pic.twitter.com/EODlzdNxwq — Reuters Asia (@ReutersAsia) December 31, 2024 Yoon – who reportedly ignored three summonses related to the inquiry – has since pushed back on the arrest warrant, with his lawyers calling it “illegal and invalid.” The warrant against the one-time prosecutor is active until January 6, making Yoon the first president to face arrest. Critics have argued that Yoon’s choice to impose martial law was an attempt to start a rebellion in the East Asian country, while the polarizing political figure claims he was protecting his citizens from alleged “anti-state forces.” The jarring governmental crisis has prompted international concerns over South Korea’s political stability as Yoon faces the death penalty should he be convicted for spearheading an insurrection against the country’s opposition-led government. Crypto Prices Dip After Martial Law Decree Following Yoon’s martial law decree on December 3, a handful of digital assets temporarily shot down in value over the political crisis. Both Bitcoin and XRP dropped by an estimated 30 percent before Yoon was ordered to rescind his decree on December 4. South Korea’s national currency, the won, briefly dipped as well – though has since seemingly returned to normal levels. News of Yoon’s reported impending arrest comes the same day as disgraced South Korean crypto tycoon, Do Kwon, was extradited to the United States. The Terraform Labs founder fell from grace in May 2022 when his algorithmic stablecoins Terra USD and LUNA crashed, wiping over $40 billion from cryptocurrency markets. The purported crypto fraudster persistently evaded authorities following the crash of his tokens by hiding out in numerous locales across Asia and Europe including Serbia, Dubai, and Montenegro. Kwon was ultimately arrested in the Bakan nation in March 2023 for falsifying travel documents in a bid to flee Europe as INTERPOL issued a “red notice” for his arrest. Kwon was imprisoned in a Montenegrin jail as South Korea and the U.S. battled for his extradition before being sent to federal prison stateside Tuesday. It is unknown whether the current political climate in South Korea played a role in that decision.

38352099,https://nulltx.com/?p=137392,1735664437,"Dogecoin Price Action Slows, Fueling FOMO for this $0.01 Altcoin Eyeing an 18,299% Rise","The Q4 Dogecoin (DOGE) rally, fueled by Trump’s electoral victory, has recently hit a plateau. With the current Dogecoin price dropping double digits over the past month, investors have noted a cooling trajectory, sparking concerns about its near-term potential. Meanwhile, an intriguing $0.01 altcoin is rapidly gaining traction, drawing FOMO among investors eyeing its extraordinary growth potential. With projections of an 18,299% PCHAIN rally by Q1 2025, this altcoin could outperform the market, becoming one of the best cryptos to buy now. Dogecoin Price Faces Stagnation Despite Crypto Market Optimism Despite a broader crypto rally sparked by a post-election market boost and the Bitcoin price surge past $100,000, the Dogecoin price action remains underwhelming. The Dogecoin price today is $0.32 , reflecting a 18.52% drop over 30 days. While Dogecoin has shown resilience with a 1.80% gain over the past day and an 8.97% rise over the week, its inability to maintain upward momentum for the month has left traders skeptical. Analysts attribute the Dogecoin price stagnation to a lack of interest in meme coins from governments and institutions fueling this bull run. With the broader market optimism shifting to utility-driven altcoins, Dogecoin (DOGE) is struggling to capture the same excitement seen during its previous peaks, considering its heavy reliance on social sentiment. This decline further cements the perception that DOGE may have reached a saturation point, compelling investors to diversify into more promising crypto assets. Why the $0.01 PropiChain (PCHAIN) Altcoin is the Market’s New Darling As the Dogecoin price faces a significant downturn, investors are dumping DOGE and seeking refuge with the PropiChain (PCHAIN) presale, which has raised nearly $2 million so far. Currently priced at $0.011, PCHAIN is the altcoin powering a groundbreaking platform that’s captivating investors with its unique combination of blockchain, real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, metaverse, smart contracts, and AI technologies. Unlike competing Web3 solutions, PropiChain is set to revolutionize the $634 trillion real estate industry by offering a full-service solution for property transactions, management, and investment. At its core, PropiChain (PCHAIN) allows fractional ownership of any property, democratizing access to real estate investment. Investors can purchase fractions of multi-million-dollar properties with as little as $100, removing elitism from an industry traditionally reserved for the rich and wealthy. Considering how PropiChain will bring liquidity to a traditionally illiquid market by enabling instant transactions combined with its metaverse marketplace taking global access to real estate to the next level, PropiChain is positioned to become the leading Web3 real estate trading hub. Furthermore, PropiChain’s AI-powered tools take its appeal a step further. With features like predictive analytics, instant asset valuation, and personalized property recommendations, the platform empowers users to make data-driven investment decisions. Its AI algorithms ensure maximum returns by identifying undervalued properties and predicting market trends. Additionally, PropiChain’s smart contract functionality automates time-intensive tasks such as asset leasing, renewals, and rent collection, significantly reducing operational costs for property managers. To wrap up, blockchain-based security ensures fraud prevention and transparent transactions, enhancing trust in a sector notorious for occupation fraud. Statista reports that the real estate industry suffers the highest losses from occupation fraud among all industries, losing billions of dollars annually. 2025 Dogecoin Price and PropiChain Price Predictions Dogecoin (DOGE) has carved out its place as a cultural phenomenon. However, its lack of substantial utility has hindered its ability to capitalize on broader market trends, as evidenced by the double-digit Dogecoin price drop coming just as the Bitcoin price hit a new ATH of $108,268. On the other hand, PropiChain (PCHAIN) is emerging as the top altcoin to buy now, considering its disruptive potential in the real estate sector. With analysts forecasting an unparalleled 18,299% growth by March, investors are visibly excited, especially after PropiChain’s successful BlockAudit security audit. Investors Splash Nearly $2 Million on “Revolutionary” Altcoin Presale PropiChain is about to revolutionize the real estate industry, and the project’s potential hasn’t gone unnoticed, with the PCHAIN presale already raising nearly $2 million in record time. For investors, PropiChain’s astronomical 18,299% profit potential is difficult to ignore as PCHAIN can rise from $0.011 to $2.012 in just three months, rivaling some of the most iconic bull runs in crypto history. Not only do round two investors get PCHAIN at the lowest price it’ll ever be again, but a modest $865 investment today can yield a staggering $159,151 by March, or much earlier if Trump’s inauguration triggers another massive bull run. However, there’s bad news. Round two of the presale is moving three times faster than the previous round, thanks to news of its early success and the bullish mood around the PropiChain CoinMarketCap listing. This means waiting any longer would likely mean missing out on the low round two price of $0.011. PCHAIN will cost $0.032 in the next round, so hurry up and join round two before it’s too late.

In his analysis, he highlighted the $1.95 price level as being crucial as it could determine XRP’s next move. XRP Price Forms Descending Triangle On The Daily Chart In an X post, Dark Defender mentioned that the XRP price has formed a descending triangle on the daily time frame. He added that a breakout is imminent in this pattern as long as $1.95 is protected. The analyst highlighted $2.22, $2.72, $2.90, and $5.85 as the initial targets XRP could reach if the price breakout occurs. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Guns For A Mid-High Timeframe Reversal Against Bitcoin In Bullish Q1 2025 Meanwhile, the crucial support levels for the XRP price are $1.95, $1.88, and $1.63. Based on an earlier analysis by Dark Defender, XRP could still rally to double digits in the long term. The analyst highlighted a bull flag that had formed on the daily chart, noting that it was similar to the one that had earlier formed on the 4-hour timeframe. Dark Defender stated that the bull flag that formed on the daily chart targets the Fibonacci Level of $5.85 and penetrates toward $10.1979. The crypto analyst remarked that this is a historical pattern approach and the Fibonacci Wave. He added that the last Fibonacci targets stand at $18.22 and $36, with no significant targets in between. The analyst’s accompanying chart showed that the XRP price could reach these targets in the first half of 2025. While analyzing XRP’s yearly chart, Dark Defender stated that a God Candle awaits next year. This came as he noted that XRP had enjoyed a breakout year in 2024, having consolidated for around six years. XRP boasts a year-to-date (YTD) gain of over 228%. From An RSI Perspective Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto provided insights into the XRP price action from a Relative Strength Index (RSI) perspective. The analyst stated that 74, 70, and 65 are the three key RSI levels to watch out for. In the most bullish scenario, he remarked that XRP needs to ideally reach 88 or even 96.5 and higher for the RSI curvature to continue trending upward. Related Reading: Legendary Analyst Peter Brandt Says Bitcoin Price Could Crash To $78,000, Here’s Why Egrag Crypto said it would be “incredibly” bullish if the XRP price bounces from the 74 range. Meanwhile, a dip to 70 could indicate bearish momentum. However, he added that a bounce from this RSI level is essential for continuing the bull run. Likewise, a dip to 65 is also bearish for XRP, but as long as the crypto doesn’t drop below this level, then a bounce would indicate a significant move ahead. The crypto analyst warned that closing below the 65 RSI level could signal the end of the bull run. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2, down over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Investors have jumped on the greenback as the Federal Reserve continues to signal steady interest rates while the rest of the world braces for deeper cuts. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against six major currencies, climbed 6.6% this year. It saw an explosive 7.5% jump in the fourth quarter alone—the biggest quarterly leap since 2015. On Tuesday, the index ticked up 0.1% to 108.16. The euro is down 0.2% to $1.0386, bleeding 6% for the year. The yen? Barely holding at 156.76 per dollar after a brutal beating. Even the pound, which held its ground better than most, only managed a meager 0.02% bump to $1.2551. Analysts say Trump’s policies will keep the greenback strong well into 2025. Hedge funds and asset managers are already going all-in, betting $29.8 billion on the dollar’s rise—the most bullish stance since April. Markets feel the dollar’s heat While the dollar flexes, global markets are trying to catch their breath. On Wall Street, stocks managed a modest bounce after three days of losses thanks to high US Treasury yields. The Dow rose 112.81 points to close at 42,688.89. The S&P 500 added 5.82 points, landing at 5,913.01. The Nasdaq slipped 21.86 points to 19,463.98. But despite a bumpy December, the S&P 500 posted a 24% gain for the year, its best two-year streak since the late ’90s. Artificial intelligence (AI) hype, anticipated Fed rate cuts, and the pro-business vibes from Trump’s incoming administration lit a fire under equities. Energy stocks led the charge, with all 11 major sectors in the green by year-end. It’s a Wall Street party, but the bond market is not invited. The 10-year Treasury yield briefly hit 4.641%, the highest since May, cooling some of the rally. The yield settled slightly lower at 4.527% on Tuesday but stayed above 4.5%, a level that makes traders squirm. The international scene isn’t looking much better. Trading volumes were thin with European markets either closed or running half-day sessions for the New Year holiday. Germany, Italy, and Switzerland didn’t even show up.

Bloomberg Analyst Predicts 30,000% Breakout For WallitIQ (WLTQ)","The Dogecoin price has faced increasing challenges as the initial hype fades, leaving many to question its long-term potential. Once driven by viral trends and celebrity endorsements, Dogecoin price now struggles to maintain momentum, and investors are looking for new opportunities. According to a Bloomberg analyst, WallitIQ (WLTQ) could experience a remarkable 30,000% breakout, positioning it as the next big cryptocurrency. As Dogecoin loses its appeal, WallitIQ (WLTQ) steps in with a clear value proposition for future growth. While the Dogecoin price may continue to falter, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is emerging as a promising investment. The Bloomberg analyst prediction highlights WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) immense potential, as it offers advanced features and real-world use cases far beyond Dogecoin. Investors are starting to take notice, making WallitIQ (WLTQ) the standout crypto choice in 2024 and 2025.

The Dwindling Appeal Of Dogecoin: Why WallitIQ (WLTQ) Could Be A Better Investment Dogecoin, once seen as a joke turned serious contender, has become a household name in the crypto world. However, the Dogecoin price has failed to maintain the meteoric rise that characterized its early success. According to CoinMarketCap, the Dogecoin price has seen significant volatility, with sharp peaks followed by equally sharp declines. While Dogecoin’s celebrity-driven hype may have driven it to new heights, it is increasingly clear that the meme coin lacks the foundational growth drivers that could sustain long-term value. As the Dogecoin price wanes, WallitIQ (WLTQ) presents itself as a more promising investment, as the Bloomberg analysts point out. Unlike the Dogecoin price, which thrives on social media hype, WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) value proposition lies in its innovative AI features, extensive crypto portfolio management, and secure platform. With WallitIQ (WLTQ) predicted by the Bloomberg analyst to experience an incredible 30,000% surge, it’s clear that its upside potential far outstrips what the Dogecoin price has left to offer.

Soltani highlighted that by 2030, the value of cross-border flows is expected to reach an astonishing $300 trillion. Despite this massive projected growth, she emphasized the inefficiencies in the current global payment systems, which are often slow, expensive, and error-prone. Ripple aims to address these challenges through its blockchain-based solutions and the use of digital assets like XRP. #Ripple 's Head of Payments Envisions $300 Trillion Cross-Border Flow—XRP to Handle It All assuming it handles a $300 trillion flow with a circulating supply of 52 billion $XRP , would be approximately $5,769.23 per #XRP . pic.twitter.com/hjroOyJGvc — Xaif | (@Xaif_03) December 29, 2024 Ripple’s Solution to the Inefficient International Payments System Ripple’s payment system leverages blockchain technology to enable faster, more affordable, and more transparent transactions. According to Soltani, the process is streamlined to ensure efficiency and reliability. She gave an example, explaining that when a business in the UK sends funds to the Philippines, Ripple’s platform facilitates the transaction by using a digital asset as a bridge currency. The funds are converted into Philippine pesos through Ripple’s extensive global partner network, ensuring the recipient receives the exact quoted amount in real-time. One of Ripple’s key advantages is its global payout network, which offers access to traditionally hard-to-reach markets and currencies. Soltani noted that businesses could begin transacting within as little as three weeks, with payments settling in seconds instead of days. This speed and scalability position Ripple as a frontrunner in modernizing international finance. It has made XRP a highly popular asset, with the World Bank highlighting it as a leading currency for cross-border transactions. As Ripple’s network grows, increased adoption could significantly boost its price. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Potential Price Target for XRP Xaif’s post drew attention to the implications of Ripple’s potential role in managing these massive cross-border flows. He posited a scenario in which XRP handles the $300 trillion annual flow projected by Soltani, with its circulating supply of 52 billion XRP. Based on this hypothesis, Xaif suggested that XRP’s value could reach $5,769.23. This valuation shows the potential scale and significance of Ripple’s technology in the evolving financial ecosystem. It also affirms the bullish stance shared by many in the XRP army. The view that XRP can serve as a global reserve currency also extends to other prominent financial voices , and experts have set targets as high as $10,000 if XRP can take control of the cross-border payments market.

This decline comes amid a broader market correction, prompting many to shift their focus toward promising altcoins that could yield significant returns. One such altcoin capturing attention is RCO Finance (RCOF), which is generating buzz for its potential to deliver extraordinary gains, with some analysts predicting returns as high as 30,000%. With the aim of improving DeFI investing, RCOF is poised for a parabolic surge, earning investors significant ROI. Ethereum Price Faces Persistent Decline: A Bearish Trend Intensifies The Ethereum price continues to struggle, signaling a potential bearish trend as it falls below critical levels. After failing to maintain momentum above the $3,550 resistance, ETH slipped beneath the $3,450 support zone and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average, a key indicator of market strength. This fresh decline has brought the Ethereum price to the $3,300 support level, precariously close to breaking lower. The recent dip aligns with the broader market movement, mirroring Bitcoin’s downward trajectory. Key technical indicators, including the hourly MACD and RSI, suggest increased bearish momentum, with Ethereum trading below the 76.4% Fibonacci retracement of its previous upward wave. A break below the $3,300 support could pave the way for the Ethereum price to slide toward $3,250 or even $3,220 in the near term. While recovery above $3,420 could stabilize the Ethereum price, the declining momentum raises concerns among investors, driving attention toward alternative opportunities like RCO Finance (RCOF). RCO Finance (RCOF): The Low-cap Altcoin with Bullish Signals As Ethereum faces challenges, RCO Finance (RCOF) is gaining traction among investors seeking high returns. RCO Finance is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) to improve trading strategies and investment opportunities In a market often dominated by giants like Ethereum, RCO Finance (RCOF) emerges as a compelling contender, showcasing a suite of features designed to attract both novice and seasoned investors. What sets RCOF apart is its innovative approach to decentralized finance (DeFi), integrating advanced technologies that promise to revolutionize how users engage with cryptocurrencies. One of the standout features of RCO Finance is its AI-powered Robo Advisor, which tailors investment strategies based on individual user profiles. This intelligent system analyzes historical price data, market trends, and news from sources like Reuters, and events to provide personalized recommendations. Eliminating emotional biases and human errors, the Robo Advisor empowers users to make informed decisions, increasing their chances of achieving optimal investment outcomes. This level of sophistication was once reserved for professional traders, but RCOF democratizes access to such tools, making them available to everyone. Another notable aspect of RCO Finance is its commitment to real-world asset integration. The platform allows users to invest in traditional assets like stocks and bonds using cryptocurrencies, effectively bridging the gap between digital and physical markets. This tokenization of real-world assets broadens investment opportunities and increases liquidity, enabling investors to diversify their portfolios without the hassle of converting cryptocurrencies into fiat currency. RCO Finance also prioritizes user privacy and security. SolidProof audits the RCOF altcoin smart contracts, and the platform does not require KYC procedures, allowing investors to maintain anonymity while still complying with necessary regulations. This focus on privacy is particularly appealing in an era where data security is needed. The platform’s governance architecture further improves its appeal. RCOF token holders significantly influence key decisions within the ecosystem, ensuring that the community’s voice is integrated into the platform’s evolution. This decentralized approach contrasts sharply with many other projects. Join the RCOF Altcoin Presale for Unmatched ROI As interest in RCO Finance continues to grow, now is the perfect time for investors to take action by participating in the ongoing presale. Currently priced at $0.0778 per altcoin during Stage 4, this presale presents a unique opportunity for early adopters to secure their stake before prices increase. With projections suggesting that RCOF could achieve returns exceeding 700% upon launch at the anticipated $0.6 and potentially reach a staggering 1,000x increase shortly thereafter, the potential for profit is immense. Investing in RCOF offers financial rewards and grants access to exclusive features within the platform. Holders can benefit from quarterly dividends based on their token holdings, ranging from 1% to 6%, depending on the number of tokens owned. Additionally, early investors will enjoy significant discounts on trading fees and access to advanced AI tools that improve their trading strategies.

Polkdaot ( DOT ) retreated by over 15% this year, while other top coins like Bitcoin ( BTC ), Solana ( SOL ), and Binance Coin ( BNB ) soared to their all-time highs. The coin’s underperformance occurred even as its network saw successful ecosystem launches. For instance, Hydration, a leading decentralized exchange within the Polkadot ecosystem, handled a record-high volume of over $124 million in December. Polkadot’s NFL Rivals, a digital collectible card game, has gained traction among NFT traders. Meanwhile, Bifrost, a liquid staking network in Polkadot, accumulated over $15.1 million in assets, while Moonwell, a lending protocol, has nearly $200 million in total value locked.

However, transfers in the fourth quarter reached an all-time high, signaling robust activity on the network. Similar growth was observed in the relay chain, where both active addresses and transfers increased. Polkadot also offers one of the highest staking yields among major cryptocurrencies, with a yield of 12% and a staking ratio of 25.13%. These strong fundamentals may support a price rebound in the coming months. Polkadot price has formed a falling wedge DOT price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart indicates that DOT price has pulled back over the past few weeks, falling from this month’s high of $11.70 to the current $6.8. Polkadot has remained above the 100-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages, signaling positivity. It has also formed a cup and handle chart pattern, with the ongoing retreat representing the handle. Additionally, a falling wedge pattern, a well-known bullish reversal indicator, has emerged. As the two lines of the wedge approach their confluence, the price is likely to experience a bullish breakout. This could propel DOT to the year-to-date high of $11.68, approximately 72% above its current level.

38351362,https://crypto.news/?p=14323712,1735662963,CryptoQuant analyst: TRX price could explode soon,"Cryptocurrencies are seeing a minor uptick as the year comes to an end, and CryptoQuant analyst Joao Wedson says one of the altcoins showing bullish potential is TRON. TRON ( TRX ) traded at around $0.2565 on Dec. 31, up by about 2.7%. Tron’s gains mirrored the broader top 10 coins, with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP all in the green. TRX has gained significantly over the past few months, with its price currently up by 140% over the past year. Wedson points to a confluence of key metrics suggesting TRON is poised for new momentum. Wedson shared this outlook in a TRX price analysis piece published on Dec. 31. He also posted the chart below on X. https://twitter.com/joao_wedson/status/1874105878150078778 You might also like: Top 5 reasons why Ethereum could take off in 2025 According to the analyst, this technical picture is down to the Price Drawdown from ATH and technical support indicators. Price Drawdown measures the coin’s decline relative to its all-time high. The variation shows TRX has held above an important trendline that dates back to 2019. Along with respecting this trendline, TRON’s price has bounced off it. The key trendline has therefore acted as robust support during accumulation periods and as an upward catalyst in recovery. “This consistency demonstrates that TRX exhibits a well-structured technical behavior, making it attractive for both traders and long-term investors,” Wedson noted. A look at TRX price over the past two years shows a descending trendline for the Price Drawdown from ATH indicator. Overall, it suggests bulls have increasingly clipped the level of bearish pain, with drawdowns now generally “less severe.” With current price levels, TRX hovers near the suggested trendline support. It’s an area that may offer bulls a fresh strategic entry point. The altcoin reached its all-time high of $0.4407 on Dec. 4, signaling a 40% drawdown.

Analysts are scratching their heads, admitting they’re clueless about where the markets are headed. The last few years have been a nonstop carnival of surprises, and nobody is brave enough to pretend they know what’s coming next. Well except for Jimmy Cramer. This time last year, who could’ve guessed the S&P 500 would explode by almost 30%? Or that inflation, which hit like a freight train in 2021, would be yesterday’s news? Now, with global equities taking a breather and Europe’s benchmark index ending an eight-day streak, all eyes are on U.S. inflation data dropping tomorrow. The market is desperate for any clue about what the Federal Reserve might do with interest rates. Spoiler alert: nobody knows. The chaos continues in global markets China is trying to save the day—or at least its own economy. Economists expect Beijing to cuts interest rates deeper than they have since 2015. The Chinese government has promised to prop up growth, but the initial rally it caused already ran out of gas. Investors are nervous, and it’s showing. Wall Street’s big brains at Deutsche Bank are still scratching their heads about the last few years. Pandemic chaos wrecked 2020 predictions. Nobody saw 2021’s inflation monster coming. Rate hikes in 2022? Total curveball. And let’s not even start on how the U.S. economy managed to flex its muscles through 2023. Now, 2025 is around the corner, and the only consensus is that there isn’t one. The Federal Reserve, for its part, is caught in a debate over tariffs. Javier Bianchi from the Minneapolis Fed has a wild take: let inflation run hot to counteract the effects of import duties. He says stimulating the economy could boost incomes and keep people spending. Sure, why not throw another wrench into the machine? Crypto runs hot Crypto’s wild ride continues. Bitcoin is still steep in correction, currently sitting around $92,680. The entire market has been basking in the glow of Trump’s election win and spot Bitcoin ETFs. BlacRock’s IBIT ETF, which launched last year, has already hit $52 billion in assets—more than 50 European ETFs combined. Daily options trading for $IBIT is averaging $1.7 billion. It has been an outstanding year for cryptos. The same cannot be said with certainty about traditional markets. Only 17% of S&P 500 stocks have outperformed the index this month. Let that sink in. That’s the worst market breadth since at least 1986. Over 400 stocks in the S&P 500 have done worse than the index in December. Eight out of 11 sectors have tanked more than 5%. The equal-weighted S&P 500 is down 6.6% compared to the index’s 2.1% drop. The rally is dead, and no one’s pretending otherwise.

38353768,https://cryptonews.com/?p=323708,1735662899,Ethereum’s ‘Symmetrical Pattern’ Hints at a Big Move – Will It Hit New Highs?,"The price of Ethereum has dipped by 0.5% today, moving to $3,396 as the crypto market suffers a 1.5% loss in the past 24 hours. ETH is also down by 15% in a fortnight and by 8% in a month, and with the alt posting a relatively modest 47% increase in a year, it has arguably underperformed in 2024. Yet crypto analyst and trader Carl Runefelt has tweeted that the token remained within a four-hour symmetrical triangle over the weekend, raising the probability of a big breakout. And with ETH still one of the strongest coins in the market in terms of fundamentals, 2025 could bring some very substantial returns for the token . Ethereum’s ‘Symmetrical Pattern’ Hints at a Big Move – Will It Hit New Highs? Looking at Ethereum’s four-hour chart over the weekend, Runefelt – AKA The Moon Show – suggested that its forming of a symmetrical triangle points to an incoming move, in either direction. $ETH managed to stay within this 4H symmetrical triangle over the weekend! Depending on #Bitcoin , these are the targets: Bullish – $3,900 Bearish – $2,920 Trade #Ethereum on Bybit – https://t.co/TsSnqpda67 pic.twitter.com/dOwV89SiJ3 — The Moon Show (@TheMoonCarl) December 29, 2024 In his view, if ETH rises in the next day or so, it could rally all the way to $3,900, which would be its highest level since the middle of this month. However, if it declines – as it has done (slightly) today – it could drop all the way to $2,920. This is a hard one to call, with some prominent figures actually suggesting that the market could fall significantly around the time of Donald Trump’s inauguration. Yet the overall, longer term trajectory of the market remains positive, given that we will see a new, pro-crypto chair of the SEC in January, as well as the likely arrival of positive crypto legislation in the US.

Looking at its one-hour chart today, we see it regaining some momentum after a very up-and-down couple of weeks. Its RSI (purple) has passed 50 and looks like it will reach 70 in a few hours, bringing price gains with it. Source: TradingView Based on this, we could see Ethereum reach $3,500 by tomorrow, and $4,000 by the end of January. Diversifying into New High-Return Presale Tokens The only thing with ETH is that, as a major token, it’s likely to experience gradual, rather than spectacular, gains. For this reason, traders pursuing bigger profits may opt to diversify into newer, smaller cap tokens, which can often outperform the market during their initial phases of growth. And one token likely to grow strongly next year is Flockerz (FLOCK), a ERC-20 token that has raised over $8.3 million in its hugely popular presale. The Flock Don't Stop!

What a proud day for all of Flocktopia pic.twitter.com/GA7JDEt4YX — Flockerz (@FlockerzToken) December 27, 2024 With only three weeks before its sale ends, investors have been plowing into Flockerz because it’s the market’s first vote-to-earn token, rewarding holders for participating in governance votes. Every major decision will go to its community, with voters receiving greater rewards the more they participate. Flockerz will also come with a staking mechanism, meaning that holders will earn staking rewards in addition to voting rewards. This could make FLOCK very profitable as a token, which helps explain why it has had such a big sale. It will have a max supply of 50 billion FLOCK, with 20% going to its presale, 25% to staking, and another 25% for governance rewards.

In its report , Grayscale analysts said that the result of the November U.S. election, which favored Donald Trump, and the approval of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) contributed to catalyze the significant increase that the value of cryptocurrencies have experienced thus far in 2024. In the case of Solana, Grayscale noted that both its layer-one network and other strong competitors like Sui (SUI) have disrupted the long-standing monopoly that Ethereum had on the smart contracts sector. Solana managed to position itself as the most scalable network of the two while its success could be partially attributed to the rise of meme coins as most creators and developers choose to rely on its mainnet to mint these assets rather than the Ethereum Virtual Network (EVM) as it offered faster transaction execution speeds and lower costs. However, although meme coins are perhaps the loudest digital assets of the Solana ecosystem, they are not necessarily the only thing that is driving the adoption of this blockchain. DeFi protocols like Jupiter, Jito, and Helium have contributed to a fair share of the network’s activity growth. In terms of fee revenue, the Solana network is getting closer and closer to Ethereum according to Grayscale’s findings. They see fee revenue as the most important catalyst for the market cap of smart contract platforms. Solana’s Bull Trap Still in Play – Successful Break Could Result in Big Short-Term Gains The price action for the Solana ($SOL) token has been forming a bullish pattern known as a flag in the past few weeks. The flag’s body has been enlarged amid multiple failed breaks of the upper boundaries, which means that the pattern could soon unfold in one way or the other. Considering that the market already managed to flush excess demand via the December 20 bull trap, late buyers could now step in during the Santa Claus rally to push the price of $SOL above the $210 mark to break the upper bound of the flag. If this happens, the price of $SOL could soon resurge to its 22 November all-time high of $264.32 per token and possibly higher once alt-season begins. The price of $SOL already doubled this year as a result of the industry-specific tailwinds mentioned earlier. However, multiple events in the future can still catalyze and move higher, including Donald Trump’s Inauguration Day, positive legislation coming through in Congress, and further embracement of the Solana ecosystem by top institutions. This Solana L2 Token Offers 523% Staking Rewards The presale of the native token of the latest layer-two network for Solana, Solaxy , marches on to raise $7.3 million from investors as it proposes to solve one of the hurdles that have prevented this blockchain from overtaking Ethereum. https://x.com/SOLAXYTOKEN/status/1873760053267939739 The rise of meme coins and the significant growth of DeFi platforms like Jupiter have congested the Solana network. Solaxy alleviates these jams by bundling transactions offline into single blocks that the network can rapidly process. With just 24 hours left until the next price increase, there’s still a bit of time for early buyers to benefit from grabbing some $SOLX tokens at the current low price. Presale events like this offer a favorable asymmetric investment opportunity that may yield high returns without taking significant risks amid the low price at which the token is currently offered. $SOLX is available at $0.001586 until the offer expires. To buy the token, visit the official website of Solaxy and connect your crypto wallet to convert ETH, USDT, or BNB into this new asset. Once the presale ends, the token will be listed on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) first and then likely picked up by the largest crypto exchanges once liquidity rises. Staking rewards for $SOLX holders are quite attractive at 523% and investors have already parked nearly 2.2 billion tokens. A year is about to end and the Solana ecosystem keeps growing by the hour. Solaxy stands to reap the rewards of this trend and early buyers of $SOLX will be the most favored.

The issue came to light following Reddit discussions, where users voiced concerns about the potential risk to their funds. This came after Clipper, a decentralized exchange (DEX), revealed that a vulnerability in its withdrawal function led to the recent $450,000 hack. The Discovery: Reddit Turns into the Watchdog It all began on December 29 when a Reddit user spotted a vulnerability within Tangem’s app. According to the post, private keys were logged in emails and might even be accessible to Tangem employees. The discovery created an uproar in the Reddit community, with users expressing frustration over the security risk. What made the situation even worse was that an earlier Reddit post discussing the issue mysteriously disappeared. This raised suspicions that Tangem was attempting to conceal the issue, sparking a wave of comments as users demanded answers from the company. How Tangem Accidentally Exposed Users’ Private Keys The issue arose from a glitch in Tangem’s log processing system. This affected users who created wallets with seed phrases and contacted customer support. This has caused certain users’ private keys to be briefly stored in email histories. Users without seed phrases were unaffected. This was because their private keys are securely generated on Tangem’s hardware cards and cannot be accessed. While fewer than 0.1% of users were impacted, the incident still damaged Tangem’s reputation despite no funds being lost or compromised. In 2024, the crypto industry faced many security breaches, with hackers stealing approximately $1.49 billion in digital assets. A major incident occurred in July 2024 when the WazirX exchange was hacked. This resulted in the theft of around $234.9 million . Additionally, compromised private keys emerged as the leading cause of crypto thefts. It accounted for 43.8% of the total losses from January to November 2024. These incidents highlight the ongoing challenges in securing digital assets and the critical importance of robust security measures within the crypto sector. Tangem Restores Users’ Confidence with a Quick Fix On December 30, Tangem quickly acknowledged the issue and assured users it was fixed. However, many users felt the lack of immediate communication raised more concerns than it resolved. Tangem deleted all sensitive logs and attachments sent to its support team to rebuild trust. They also released an app update to prevent future logging of private keys. Tangem promised to contact affected users with instructions on securing their accounts. All users were urged to update to the latest version, which includes enhanced security features. The company also highlighted its bug bounty program, rewarding ethical hackers who find vulnerabilities and showing its commitment to improving user security.

38350929,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53538,1735661764,Cardano (ADA)’s Key Demand Walls to Prevent a Drop Below $0.65,"Cardano (ADA), the ninth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, remains below the $1 psychological threshold. After slipping beneath this level in mid-December, the asset has continued to face bearish pressure, dropping to an intra-month low of $0.7620. This ongoing correction marks the third consecutive week of decline for Cardano (ADA), leaving traders closely monitoring critical support levels that could mitigate further losses. Identifying Key Demand Zones Insights from IntoTheBlock highlight significant demand walls that could provide crucial support for Cardano amid its continued price decline. One of the most critical support zones lies between $0.8366 and $0.6683. Within this range, approximately 223,070 wallets have accumulated 1.97 billion ADA. This demand zone could serve as a vital buffer against additional bearish momentum, potentially preventing the asset from plunging below $0.65. Additionally, a second support zone is identified between $0.5353 and $0.6683. At this level, 405,660 addresses acquired 5.39 billion ADA at an average price of $0.5973. This deeper demand wall could act as a secondary safety net in the event the upper support zone fails to hold. Historical Importance of the $0.68–$0.77 Range Further analysis points to the historical significance of the price range between $0.68 and $0.77. Market data shows that this zone has been a critical level for Cardano on multiple occasions. Notably, the region provided short-term support during Cardano’s previous downward corrections, including the December 20 drop when the asset reached an intraday low of $0.7620. Beyond recent price action, the $0.68–$0.77 range played a pivotal role during the 2022 bear market, acting as a support level before eventually flipping to resistance. This resistance was observed again in December 2023 and March, when ADA faced rejections in its upward attempts, leading to further corrections. Conversely, when ADA managed to reclaim this zone in November, it triggered a bullish uptrend, confirming its importance as a support level in the current market cycle. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Potential Consequences of Support Loss If Cardano fails to maintain support above the $0.5973–$0.7556 range, the next significant demand wall lies much lower, near $0.46. This level served as a key support zone during the January correction, with 432,150 wallets accumulating 3.5 billion ADA at an average price of $0.4852. A break below the current demand zone could result in a substantial 46% drop toward this lower support, compounding the ongoing losses. Current Price Action At the time of writing, ADA is trading at $0.8737, reflecting a modest 1.15% increase over the past 24 hours. Despite this minor uptick, the asset remains under pressure from prevailing bearish market conditions. Traders and investors will closely monitor the aforementioned support levels to assess the potential for stabilization or further declines in the coming weeks.

38351354,https://coinedition.com/?p=568416,1735661700,XRP Beats Bitcoin and Ethereum in South Korea: $1B Trading Volume Surge,"XRP trading volume in South Korea surpasses Bitcoin and Ethereum on major exchanges. UpBit sees XRP accounting for 13.67% of its total volume, leading Bitcoin and Ethereum. The surge in XRP volumes comes amid heightened market speculation due to political developments. XRP trading volumes on South Korea’s top crypto exchanges have surged past Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), crossing $1 billion in 24 hours. In the last 24 hours, total XRP trading volume across Upbit, Bithumb, and Korbit—the country’s leading exchanges—neared $1 billion. This signals a significant rise in XRP activity on these platforms. XRP Volume Breakdown on Korean Exchanges On Upbit alone, XRP accounted for $716.79 million of the $5.23 billion total trading volume, far outpacing Bitcoin’s $400.43 million. Ethereum lagged behind with only 2.51% of the total trading volume, reflecting XRP’s growing dominance among South Korean traders. Moreover, while XRP accounted for 13.67% of UpBit’s volume, Bitcoin’s ratio was about half that. Remarkably, Ethereum, the largest altcoin , had little appeal on UpBit, with only 2.51% of the total $5.23 billion volume.

38350758,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=635454,1735661478,AI and Trump-Elon duo set to shake US tech sector in 2025,"2025 is set to be a wild ride for the US tech industry, and not in a good way. With Donald Trump getting back in the White House and Elon Musk pulling strings everywhere from Silicon Valley to Capitol Hill, better prepare for chaos. The sector, already juggling AI wars, social media bans, and geopolitical tensions, now faces an unpredictable duo with the power to change (or wreck) everything. Trump’s return means Big Tech is being dragged into his plans, whether it’s aiding mass deportation policies or tackling China’s tech dominance. Elon, on the other hand, has become the new kingmaker, using his social media platform X (formerly Twitter) and his billions. TikTok bans, brain rot, and the fight for attention Let’s start with TikTok. The clock is ticking—pun intended—on its January 19 deadline for divestiture or a complete US ban. The Supreme Court will hear arguments in early January, but Trump has already filed an amicus brief asking for a delay. His reasoning? The court needs “breathing space” to make a decision. Critics call it stalling. Supporters say it’s “ smart strategy .” Either way, TikTok’s future in the US hangs in the balance. Meanwhile, the term “brain rot” has officially entered the cultural lexicon as Oxford’s Word of the Year. It’s fitting, given the state of social media in 2024. Platforms like Facebook have been drowning in AI-generated sludge, driving users to boredom or outright disgust. Engagement is plummeting. Governments are stepping in. Australia’s ban on social media for anyone under 16 has sparked debates worldwide. In America, schools are banning smartphones, and lawmakers are ramping up efforts to fight digital addiction. Trump’s ban on TikTok could be the biggest shock to the social media landscape yet. If he gets his way, platforms like X and Facebook might scramble to fill the void, but with users already fatigued by algorithm-driven junk, who’s to say they’ll even stick around? Silicon Valley’s uneasy deal with Trump Silicon Valley is not the rebellious teenager it was in 2017. Back then, Big Tech CEOs pledged to resist Trump’s policies. In 2025, with tighter budgets and employees on shorter leashes, the tone has changed. A steady stream of tech executives has been spotted at Mar-a-Lago, essentially bowing down to Trump. According to the president himself, “ Everyone loves me. ” Why? Government contracts are juicy, and Trump’s geopolitical moves—like escalating trade wars with China—create opportunities for companies willing to play ball. This new alliance isn’t without risks, though. History books won’t look kindly on companies aiding mass deportations or entering controversial military contracts. But with wars in Ukraine and Gaza providing moral cover, many companies seem ready to take the plunge. AI, chips, and the new Cold War AI isn’t the golden goose everyone thought it would be. Sure, it’s flashy, but the numbers aren’t adding up. Companies are pouring billions into data centers and semiconductors, yet the returns are sluggish. Nvidia, AI’s poster child, is under siege. CEO Jensen Huang faces mounting competition from Amazon and Broadcom, while geopolitical tensions with China threaten Nvidia’s dominance. Beijing isn’t taking US trade restrictions lightly, and Nvidia is a prime target for retaliation. Consolidation is inevitable. Smaller AI startups are folding, and bigger players are eyeing mergers to stay afloat. Meanwhile, local communities are pushing back against the rapid expansion of data centers. Politicians are caught in the crossfire, torn between tech lobbyists and angry constituents. Even newsrooms aren’t safe. AI tools are both a blessing and a curse for journalism. On the one hand, they offer powerful reporting capabilities. On the other, they’re siphoning ad revenue and undermining copyright protections. Legislators are scrambling to modernize copyright law, with “fair use” becoming a buzzword. Will it work? Probably not. But the fight is on.

It Left Bitcoin and Ethereum Behind! – An Incredible Prediction Came from an Analyst for XRP!,"While Bitcoin is at the forefront among the cryptocurrencies that benefited the most from Donald Trump's victory, XRP is also at the top. Because XRP has climbed to the $3 limit in the rally it started in recent months. While the bullish momentum in XRP has waned in December, the price has dipped below $2 but continues to hold above $2. XRP continues to stay at the top of South Korea's largest exchanges as it struggles with declines. According to the data, XRP exceeded $800 million in dollar terms in the last 24 hours in trading volume in KRW trading parity on UpBit and Bithumb, South Korea's largest exchanges in terms of volume and number of users. UpBit recorded over $600 million in volume and Bithumb over $200 million. Bitcoin’s trading volume was less than half of these levels. Interest in leading altcoins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ethereum (ETH) also remained low compared to XRP. Experts pointed out that South Korean investors contributed to the buying pressure by creating enthusiastic increases in altcoins and affected the prices upwards, and said that these volume increases could indicate a potential increase in the XRP price. $11 Target for XRP! As investors in South Korea turn to XRP, popular analyst Ali Martinez also made a bold prediction for XRP. The analyst predicted a major rally for XRP in 2025, predicting that the price could reach a new high of $11. https://x.com/ali_charts/status/1873858351857328157 *This is not investment advice.

38350359,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=376793,1735661006,"Investors Are Moving Their BTC Away From Exchanges, What Does This Mean?","Bitcoin (BTC) is consolidating between $94,000 and $92,000, but investors are moving their assets out of exchanges. The asset has plunged in the last two weeks and was hovering around $93,750 at the time of writing. Analysis by CryptoQuant official AxelAdlerJr revealed that crypto exchanges are recording very low levels of BTC deposits while investors are moving assets away from the platforms, possibly to their personal wallets. AxelAdlerJr said these trends suggest BTC could see robust price movements in the near term. Lower Daily BTC Deposits According to AxelAdlerJr, crypto exchanges have witnessed around 30,000 BTC daily deposits over the past few weeks, similar to record lows seen in 2016. In contrast, 10-year average daily deposits hover around 90,000 BTC, and this bull cycle’s peak sits at 125,000 BTC, especially when the asset hit the bullish mark of $66,000. The last time bitcoin’s daily deposit figures were at this low level was during the onset of its major rally. “When users send fewer coins to trading platforms, it typically suggests they prefer to keep their BTC in personal wallets rather than gearing up to sell,” stated AxelAdlerJr. A decrease in deposits on exchanges could lead to a shortage of BTC on the spot market, triggering positive price movements, per the laws of demand and supply. While low deposits do not guarantee a swift price upswing for BTC, they could create an environment that would trigger positive momentum. Traders Move BTC From Exchanges In addition to the plunge in daily BTC deposits on exchanges, traders are moving their bitcoins away from these trading platforms. AxelAdlerJr cited the Netflow-to-Reserve Ratio, a metric that monitors the relationship between net inflows and outflows to exchanges and their total reserves . When the Netflow-to-Reserve Ratio turns negative, it signals a dominance of outflows from exchanges, meaning BTC is being withdrawn. While the metric is currently negative, the CryptoQuant official noted that the most pronounced negative values were seen at the end of the bear market when traders bought BTC from forced sellers at roughly $17,000. “The drop in daily deposits to exchanges to a level not seen since 2016 suggests a large-scale trend of holding Bitcoin in personal wallets, while the Netflow-to-Reserve Ratio confirms a continued outflow of coins. Taken together, these signals set the stage for potentially more robust price movements in the future,” AxelAdlerJr added.

While the broader market cools off, whales are doubling down on PEPE , scooping up massive amounts, signaling strong faith in its potential. For now, PEPE shows us why meme coins can be wildly unpredictable yet endlessly fascinating. Bonk still packs a punch but BURNmas mania cools off Bonk is strutting its way through the meme coin scene, clinching fourth place on CoinGecko’s leaderboard with a hefty $2.4 billion market cap . November saw BONK soaring to a record high of $0.00005825, but a recent burn event that took over $51 million worth of tokens out of circulation followed a 31.67% price dip in December. Unlike earlier burns that sparked hotter rallies, this time, BONK didn’t quite catch the same wind in its sails. Even so, it’s far from floundering. BONK is still up 125% for the year and sits 37,000% higher than its all-time low—a stat that’s hard to ignore. With a potentially crypto-savvy U.S. administration stepping in next year, speculation is mounting over how meme coins like BONK could reach new ATHs to add up to a wholesome $1 trillion market cap . 1FUEL: The future of DeFi is here While PEPE and BONK cater to the meme coin crowd, 1FUEL comes with practical tools that have pulled in over $900k during its ongoing presale.

42415886,acf9bc56-70c0-4cdf-958d-cd52e4556212,1735660632,Blockchain Fragmentation Is a Major Problem That Must Be Addressed in 2025,"Over the past year, the crypto industry has attracted users on an exponential scale, with monthly active addresses tripling from 70 million in 2023 to over 220 million in 2024. With over 300 chains listed, the ecosystem should be able to cater to the needs of all types of users sustainably. However, in this sprawling landscape, a majority of activity and liquidity is locked within multiple Ethereum Layer 2’s.  In its current state, Ethereum is reminiscent of early 1500s Europe, which experienced breakthroughs like the printing press and advanced shipbuilding that enhanced resource management. Today, Ethereum's flourishing DeFi ecosystem is equipped with primitives such as lending and borrowing, staking and restaking. However, much like Europe's challenges with scarce and overutilized resources, Ethereum faces obstacles in making other assets useful in its own home — its Layer 1.  The current blockchain ecosystem thus remains frustratingly fragmented. While chain abstraction has been a trending narrative with many projects making progress, solutions like intents usually involve sequencers that favor large players when filling orders between blockchains, leading to centralization. Furthermore, there is no additional utility created for users as most solutions are focused on simply swapping assets.  Despite impressive technological foundations, we've created a landscape where digital assets are constrained rather than empowered. Top blockchain resources such as Ethereum are underutilized and limited by rigid architectural boundaries.  For true interoperability to exist, in 2025, we must take a step back and re-approach blockchain modularity from a fresh perspective.  The illusion of modularity  The common analogy of blockchain as ""Lego blocks"" oversimplifies a complex technological landscape. Unlike uniform construction pieces, blockchain components are intricate systems with specific dependencies and complex interoperability challenges.  Consider a practical scenario: moving an asset between different blockchain networks should be straightforward. Yet current solutions like basic token swaps offer minimal functionality. The technology demands a more nuanced, sophisticated approach.  Emerging technologies are changing this narrative. General message-passing alternatives and advances in transaction finality are allowing for a more organic, unified ecosystem. The ultimate goal isn't just connecting disparate parts but creating an infrastructure where different networks can collaborate effortlessly.  2025: The year of utility and accessibility  Looking ahead to 2025, I anticipate a two-pronged approach to address current and future fragmentation issues. In order to appeal to users and build a sustainable user base, the infrastructure should blend into the background so users can focus on the application itself without getting caught up in the technology behind it.  Currently, users are unable to utilize their assets optimally due to complicated bridging solutions which disincentivize users from moving their assets easily across the chains. Instead, we need to provide users with an avenue to maximize their yield while contributing to the ecosystem. This can be achieved by giving freedom to token holders to move their assets from chain to chain without bridging, through solutions like restaking. As restaking expands beyond Ethereum connecting multiple Layer 1 and Layer 2 networks, this is a growing area of interest for users.  Instead of fragmenting the ecosystem with new, competing blockchains, projects will focus on enhancing and interconnecting existing infrastructure. This approach will breathe new life into currently dormant chains, driving activity and creating genuine value.  On top of improvements to the underlying infrastructure, user experience will also take center stage. We'll see applications that integrate blockchain functionality so seamlessly that users will interact with sophisticated technology without ever recognizing its complexity. The infrastructure will become invisible — a powerful backend that complements fluid frontend experiences without technical friction.  Creating a global marketplace  While 2024 marked significant acceptance of the industry, evidenced by increased investment in assets like bitcoin, true adoption requires an inclusive vision. We should not just build financial instruments, but create a global marketplace where everything talks to everything else, enabling every asset to reach its maximum potential.  The future of blockchain isn't about individual chains competing for supremacy. It's about creating a collaborative, fluid infrastructure that enables users access to economic potential, by building the future of how money and value can work.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Altan Tutar ,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/12/31/blockchain-fragmentation-is-a-major-problem-that-must-be-addressed-in-2025,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/221c65a9c2c3d0a237ae2098f5d8301349afd58f-4915x3932.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

38350028,https://finbold.com/?p=224657,1735660249,XRP breakout alert: Key levels to watch as targets hit $5.85,"XRP is on the verge of a potential breakout, with analysts highlighting critical levels that could shape its trajectory toward $5.85. Notably, an analysis by Dark Defender on December 31 highlights that XRP is trading within a descending triangle pattern on the daily time frame, a technical setup often associated with significant breakouts. Key support and resistance levels for XRP The analysis highlights $1.95 as a critical support level within the descending triangle pattern, which has provided a solid foundation for XRP amidst recent market volatility. Dark Defender suggests that as long as this level holds, XRP is well-positioned for an upside breakout. If the breakout materializes, immediate resistance levels are anticipated at $2.22, $2.72, and $2.90, with a long-term projection extending to $5.85. XRP price analysis. Source: DarkDefender/X Furthermore, a “throwback” scenario could also occur, where the price briefly retests the breakout level before surging higher. This retest would serve as additional confirmation for traders seeking to enter long positions, reinforcing the bullish outlook. However, failure to sustain the $1.95 support could significantly alter the current narrative. In such a scenario, XRP might revisit lower support levels at $1.88 or even $1.63, potentially invalidating the bullish projection. This would likely shift market sentiment to bearish , delaying any recovery attempts and adding pressure to the broader outlook. Regulatory and market forces in play Beyond technical analysis, key regulatory and market developments are shaping XRP’s outlook. Former President Donald Trump’s nomination of Paul Atkins, a pro-crypto advocate, as the incoming SEC Chair is widely viewed as a positive catalyst. This move is anticipated to resolve the legal uncertainties surrounding Ripple Labs, potentially marking the end of Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC, which has persisted since 2020. Adding to the optimism is the timing of the SEC’s appeal, scheduled for January 15, 2025, just days before Trump’s inauguration. Market participants are increasingly hopeful that a resolution could pave the way for a more favorable regulatory environment for Ripple, including the potential approval of a spot ETF for XRP in 2025. Such a development would serve as a significant catalyst for XRP’s long-term growth However, despite this optimistic outlook, XRP faces immediate headwinds. The token is at risk of slipping below the $2 psychological barrier , primarily due to increased selling pressure and broader market dynamics. Ripple Labs’ escrow system, which releases 1 billion XRP tokens into circulation on the first day of each month, is expected to further contribute to this pressure by increasing the token supply. XRP price analysis At press time, XRP was trading at $2.12, reflecting a 27% drop from its December 2 high of $2.71. XRP one-day price chart. Source: Finbold Despite this setback, the token has delivered an impressive year-to-date (YTD) gain of 258%. Adding to the optimism, XRP has risen 5.8% on the daily chart, hinting at a potential recovery amid ongoing market volatility. While regulatory developments bring optimism, the token’s near-term trajectory remains uncertain, with key market dynamics and supply-side factors adding complexity to XRP’s outlook.

38349923,https://finbold.com/?p=224659,1735660084,AI predicts Hedera price for 2025,"In early Q2 2024, Hedera ( HBAR ) saw prices shoot up from $0.08853 to $0.15649 on account of positive developments surrounding the token’s role in real-world tokenization (RWA). BlackRock (NYSE: BLK ) announced in late April that it had tokenized one of its U.S. Treasury money market funds on Hedera’s network. This 76.76% surge didn’t last — by the end of April, the price of HBAR had receded to $0.009358. After that, it entered an extended downtrend, which lasted until early November, when the wider cryptocurrency market entered a bull run. Since then, the price of Hedera has risen to $0.27880 — year-to-date (YTD) returns stand at 226.62%, although the digital asset is still trading some 24.52% lower compared to its yearly high of $0.36939 HBAR price YTD chart. Source: Finbold At present, Hedera is the 17th largest cryptocurrency in the world, with a market capitalization of roughly $10.71 billion. It’s a promising, affordable token — so Finbold has decided to consult one of the most advanced publicly available AI models to determine what Hedera’s price will be in 2025. AI highlights bullish and bearish factors affecting HBAR For additional context, OpenAI ’s ChatGPT-4o model was first asked to provide a list of the most relevant factors, both bullish and bearish, at play with HBAR. It outlined four factors on either side. Hedera’s numerous partnerships with leading corporations were singled out as a strong bullish signal, suggesting that it has already become a preferred blockchain solution for businesses on account of its enterprise-grade governance model. The AI model also singled out Hedera’s high transaction speeds of up to 10,000 TPS, which require minimal energy consumption as a potent draw for new clients. Lastly, ChatGPT cited an ever-increasing list of use cases spanning everything from supply chain management to telecommunications and finance — a fact that provides Hedera with a rather large total addressable market (TAM). Bullish factors affecting Hedera. Source: OpenAI On the bearish side of the aisle, the first factor that was listed was the intense competition present, stemming from robust Layer-1 alternatives such as Solana ( SOL ) and Avalanche (AVAX). After that, the AI noted that overreliance on enterprise growth and shifting macroeconomic factors could also serve to curtail future growth. Finally, OpenAI’s flagship model pointed out that, as effective as Hedera’s governance model has been in terms of compliance, perceived centralization could serve to deter retail and decentralization-focused developers. Bearish factors affecting Hedera. Source: OpenAI AI sets Hedera price forecast for 2025 Once all was said and done, ChatGPT-4o set three price targets — reflecting a bullish, bearish, and mixed scenario in 2025. If the positive catalysts prove to be dominant, the AI model sees a range of $0.50 to $0.75 as a reasonable price target for 2025. In contrast, if the digital asset sees adoption slow down and unfavorable macroeconomic trends take hold, OpenAI’s model expects to see the price of HBAR drop to between $0.20 and $0.15. ChatGPT’s price targets for HBAR in 2025.

BTC Drops to $60K, Are Lightchain AI and Cardano (ADA) Set to Bounce?","Bitcoin’s recent slide to $60,000 has reignited debates about whether the cryptocurrency has found a bottom or is bracing for further losses. This critical price level has acted as a psychological anchor for traders and analysts alike, highlighting a moment of reckoning in the volatile crypto market. As Bitcoin seeks stability, innovative projects like Lightchain AI (LCAI) and established contenders like Cardano (ADA) are drawing attention for their potential to bounce back strongly amid market turbulence. Bitcoin at $60K Testing Critical Support Levels The $60,000 mark represents a significant support zone for Bitcoin, both technically and psychologically. This level is seen as a potential bottom by many traders, with market participants eyeing it as a key indicator for future price action. Bitcoin’s current struggles can be attributed to macroeconomic factors, such as concerns over tightening monetary policies and regulatory uncertainties. Additionally, profit-taking by large holders has contributed to the downward pressure. Despite these challenges, Bitcoin’s long-term fundamentals remain solid, with institutional adoption and its capped supply providing a strong foundation for future growth. Whether Bitcoin can hold this level will determine its trajectory and ripple effects across the broader crypto market. Lightchain AI (LCAI) Driving Innovation Amid Market Uncertainty As Bitcoin consolidates, Lightchain AI is emerging as a project with extraordinary growth potential. The platform’s integration of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology sets it apart as a pioneer in decentralized AI applications. Lightchain AI’s core innovations, such as the Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism and the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), position it as a transformative force in both blockchain and AI domains. Currently in Stage 10 of its presale, LCAI tokens are priced at $0.0045, with the next stage set to increase the price to $0.004875. With over $6.28 million already raised, the project is gaining significant traction among investors. Lightchain AI’s deflationary tokenomics and focus on real-world applications, such as financial modeling and healthcare diagnostics, create a compelling case for its long-term success. For investors seeking opportunities beyond Bitcoin, LCAI’s unique blend of innovation and early-stage entry price make it a standout contender. Cardano (ADA) Building Strength Through Scalability and Adoption Cardano has consistently positioned itself as one of the most methodical and scientifically grounded blockchain platforms. With its energy-efficient Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism and a robust development roadmap, Cardano appeals to those looking for sustainable and scalable solutions. Its upcoming Hydra scaling solution is expected to significantly enhance transaction throughput, making the platform more attractive for decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) applications. In addition to its technical merits, Cardano benefits from a loyal community and strategic partnerships that continue to drive adoption. Despite market fluctuations, ADA remains a reliable choice for investors seeking steady growth. As Bitcoin’s volatility shakes the market, Cardano’s proven stability and ongoing development make it well-positioned for a rebound when market sentiment improves. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

This development comes as CEO Paolo Ardoino addresses the fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) surrounding USDT’s status in Europe following MiCA’s implementation deadline on December 30. Details From the Latest Purchase According to on-chain data from Arkham Intelligence, Tether transferred 7,629 BTC to its reserves on December 30, 2024, moving the tokens from sister exchange Bitfinex’s hot wallet to its corporate crypto reserve address. BitInfoCharts shows that this move is the largest transaction to the company’s strategic Bitcoin reserve since March 2024, when it transferred 8,888.88 BTC. Tether also made a similar transfer of 8,888.88 BTC on December 30, 2023. With this new addition, the company now holds a total of 83,758 BTC, worth around $7.8 billion at current prices. The latest development is part of its ongoing strategy to diversify its portfolio, with the announcement made in May 2023 as part of the firm’s bid to create additional revenue streams. Following the declaration, the stablecoin operator committed to regularly allocating up to 15% of its net realized operating profits toward purchasing the flagship cryptocurrency. Beyond the buys, Tether has been diversifying its investments into emerging sectors such as AI, Bitcoin mining, and decentralized communications. CEO Ardoino Addresses FUD However, the latest purchase comes as Tether faces increasing concerns surrounding the legal status of USDT in Europe. The implementation of the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation on December 30, 2024, has raised uncertainty about the asset’s future on European exchanges. MiCA, which aims to standardize and regulate cryptocurrency operations across the European Union, has caused fears that USDT may be delisted from exchanges within the bloc due to Tether’s reported failure to meet compliance requirements. Meanwhile, the uncertainty surrounding the potential delisting under the framework has led to a notable drop in the stablecoin’s market cap. CoinGecko data shows that USDT’s overall value in the market fell from $140 billion over the past week to approximately $137 billion. The over $3 billion decline marks the largest drop in a year of continuous growth for the cryptocurrency. In response to these concerns, CEO Paolo Ardoino addressed the growing FUD in an X post , reassuring the crypto community and urging them not to be swayed by misleading information. The statement was made after lawyer Jonathan Galea published a thread on the same social media platform discussing the potential legal implications of the incoming rules for stablecoins. Ardoino emphasized that “USDT is safe,” dismissing concerns about it as baseless and attributing them to competitors attempting to exploit the situation.

38349410,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=314670,1735659042,Macro Guru Raoul Pal Says This Crypto Asset Sector Is His ‘Highest-Conviction’ Investment for the Next Decade,"Former Goldman Sachs executive and macro expert Raoul Pal believes one crypto asset sector will perform extremely well over the next decade. Pal tells his 1.1 million followers on the social media platform X that the non-fungible token (NFT) sector may flourish due to fiat currency debasement and the growing popularity of digital assets among younger generations. “My highest conviction ‘set it and forget it’ investment for the next 10 years is crypto art. For me, it’s the most compelling, enjoyable and interesting area in all crypto. Massive crypto wealth creation, along with monetary debasement, will drive incredible demand for scarce desirable assets (digital real estate or, well, digital art). Younger generations are more attracted to digital assets than most physical assets. If, as [MicroStrategy founder Michael] Saylor says, BTC is Manhattan real estate, then the best crypto art, or NFTs, are the scarcest, most desirable block space of all.” He also says that NFTs are a more cost-effective and efficient way to possess assets than physical things. “Also as people go up the crypto wealth-curve, you soon realize that physical property is expensive to hold as an investment and is better as a lifestyle asset. Art fills that gap and crypto art is ultra-cheap to custody for extended periods. Like property, it can be used as collateral too, if you so desire it.” According to Pal, NFTs are already being used more as long-term investments. “The days of flipping art NFTs are largely over. The game now is to buy and hold the best artists (new or older) and demand will only grow over time while supply gets taken off the market for decades. There is realistically very little supply of established art currently and it will keep shrinking.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

38349414,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=668412,1735659000,Shiba Inu Testing A Significant Support Zone – Bullish Breakout Ahead?,"Shiba Inu has faced consistent bearish price action, with its value dropping over 44% since reaching a local high in early December. This prolonged downtrend has left investors and traders questioning whether the popular meme coin can recover or if further losses are on the horizon. Related Reading: Ethereum Stays Within Symmetrical Pattern – Analyst Sets ETH Target Top analyst Ali Martinez has shed light on Shiba Inu’s current price structure, sharing a detailed technical analysis that pinpoints the asset’s most significant support zone between $0.0000215 and $0.0000193. According to Martinez, this range represents a crucial battleground for SHIB. Holding above this support could pave the way for a substantial rally, reigniting optimism among holders and signaling a potential reversal in sentiment. However, a failure to defend this critical zone may trigger deeper corrections, extending the bearish momentum that has gripped the market. For now, all eyes are on Shiba Inu as it tests these pivotal levels. Whether the token can stabilize and recover or succumb to further downside pressure will likely depend on broader market dynamics and the ability of SHIB’s community and whales to support its price. Shiba Inu Holding Key Demand Shiba Inu remains a focal point for meme coin enthusiasts, capturing attention for its resilience and potential to deliver gains. Following a clean breakout post-election, the token has seen renewed interest from retail investors eager to identify an opportune entry point. The allure of meme coins, combined with Shiba Inu’s history of explosive rallies, continues to make it a speculative favorite among traders. Top analyst Ali Martinez recently highlighted Shiba Inu’s critical support zone between $0.0000215 and $0.0000193. Martinez’s technical analysis indicates that holding above this range is vital for the token’s price trajectory. If SHIB maintains these levels, it could spark a wave of buying pressure as investors flock to capitalize on its perceived upside potential. A stabilization within this zone might act as a launchpad for future price surges, reigniting excitement across its loyal community. Related Reading: Cardano Holds Crucial Support At $0.77 – Massive Rally Ahead? However, the risks are equally evident. Shiba Inu’s momentum may wane as interest shifts toward emerging meme coins that promise quick gains or novel narratives. Competing for attention in the crowded meme coin market is a constant challenge. To stay relevant, Shiba Inu must leverage its strong community support and strategic developments. Technical Analysis: Key Levels To Watch Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently trading at $0.00002117, showing resilience by holding the 200-day EMA at $0.00002059 as a key support level. This development is significant, as the 200-day EMA is widely regarded as a long-term strength indicator in technical analysis. Maintaining support above this mark signals that SHIB may be gearing up for a potential price surge. Fostering optimism among traders and investors. The 200-day EMA often acts as a critical dividing line between bullish and bearish trends. For SHIB, defending this level not only reinforces market confidence but also sets the stage for buyers to regain momentum. A sustained hold above the EMA could catalyze a broader rally. Potentially pushing SHIB toward higher resistance levels and reviving its appeal among meme coin enthusiasts.

As the crypto market enters 2025, venture capital (VC) firms are gearing up to invest in blockchain and DeFi. Despite a strong recovery in 2024, crypto VC funding remains below its peak. However, according to The Block , VCs are optimistic about growth in the coming year. They cite shifting regulations, increasing institutional investments, and continued technological advancements as key drivers. 2024 Funding Overview and 2025 Outlook In 2024, crypto venture investments rose by 28% to $13.7 billion. While this shows growth from 2023, it’s still lower than the levels seen in 2021-2022. Analysts predict continued growth in crypto funding by 2025.

It should also be noted that a potential bearish head and shoulders pattern could be waiting to ambush the bulls if the price does go higher. Bullish targets are $0.000023 at the 0.618 Fibonacci, and $0.000025 at the 0.786 Fibonacci.

38350925,https://invezz.com/?p=2413016,1735658849,Power of stablecoins: what’s driving their $205 billion growth,"While the meteoric rise of Bitcoin grabbed headlines throughout 2024, a quieter revolution was taking place in the cryptocurrency world. This year, major financial firms and payment processors have turned their attention to stablecoins, a unique type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to the US dollar or another traditional currency. This emerging asset class is rapidly gaining traction as mainstream players such as Visa, PayPal, and Stripe invest heavily in projects involving stablecoins, attracted by their potential for real-world applications and lucrative business opportunities. The allure of stability: a new era for crypto transactions Stablecoins are proving to be a lucrative business venture, as issuers invest reserves backing them into short-term US Treasuries, which offer attractive yields. Unlike the wild price fluctuations of Bitcoin and other volatile tokens, stablecoins are gaining popularity as an actual currency for transactions around the world, this appeal is largely due to their reliability and predictable value. Rob Hadick, a general partner at Dragonfly, a digital-asset venture firm, told Bloomberg: We’ve seen significant growth in demand from some of the largest companies in the world that participate in under-served payment verticals like global contractor and employee payouts, trade finance, and remittance. There is both significant demand from end users in receiving US dollars, which can be near impossible using non-stablecoin rails, but also from senders who want to bypass the correspondent banking system which can be slow, costly, and have high failure rates. Market competition heats up The coming year is expected to see increased competition in the stablecoin market, which collectively has grown to approximately $205 billion, according to DeFiLlama. While Tether’s USDT has extended its lead, reaching a current market cap of around $140 billion, regulatory headwinds are emerging as the calendar turns to 2025. Specifically, the European Union’s Markets in Cryptoassets (MiCA) rules mandate that all stablecoins listed on centralized exchanges must be issued by an entity holding an e-money license. While Circle Internet Financial Ltd., Tether’s main competitor, obtained such a permit in July, Tether has yet to apply, potentially risking delisting from several EU-based crypto exchanges. Mainstream players dive Into the stablecoin space Several US companies are now entering the stablecoin arena. Visa launched a new platform known as the Visa Tokenized Asset Platform, designed for banks to issue stablecoins and other tokens. Revolut is also considering launching its own stablecoin, and payments company Stripe recently acquired fintech platform Bridge, which specializes in stablecoin transactions. Meanwhile, PayPal already has its own dollar-tracking cryptocurrency called PYUSD, created in collaboration with New York-based Paxos. Augustus Ilag, investment partner and head of Asia at CMT Digital, told Bloomberg: Stablecoin issuance is an attractive business model today. Many players have woken up to just how attractive this can be, off the back of the success of companies like Circle and Tether. By launching stablecoins, companies gain a new revenue stream, a compelling addition for many businesses looking to diversify their offerings. He also added that by running on blockchains, stablecoins reduce the transaction costs and improve the efficiency of moving money. Stablecoins: a bridge to the future Johann Kerbrat, crypto general manager at Robinhood, told Bloomberg that his company is working with stablecoin issuer Paxos to participate in an open network for stablecoin usage called Global Dollar Network, as “We have a lot of money moving around the platform, like between Robinhood and market makers or other entities, So you can see that the stablecoins have tons of value.” Of course, stablecoins are not without risks, as demonstrated by the failure of TerraUSD in 2022. This event wiped out $200 billion from crypto’s total market cap and led to several digital-asset companies going bankrupt. Regulatory frameworks and future growth Despite the lack of a unified federal regulatory regime in the US, the EU has made strides with its new MiCA rules, offering clear guidance on stablecoin regulation. Tarun Chitra, general partner of venture fund Robot Ventures, told Bloomberg: European governments want fintechs to be more like banks and have Basel-like requirements, which basically kills them relative to other banks since fintechs are like narrow banks. Stablecoins avoid many of those issues, which also make the process automated. With the crypto markets experiencing a resurgence, many are optimistic about the industry’s potential for growth in 2025. Anna Yuan, founder of the stablecoin project Perena, noted that “Stablecoins allow them to get into crypto without touching the risky aspects of securities and scammy parts,” positioning stablecoins as a key avenue for non-crypto companies looking to gain exposure to digital assets.

38351044,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=107061,1735658791,Poppe Shares Most Optimal Entry Points for XRP Amid Correction,"An analyst has shared what he described as the optimal entry points for XRP, the XRP Ledger native token, as the broader market downtrend endures. XRP's southward spiral has entered the fourth consecutive week as the crypto market continues to retrace. Notably, analysts view this correction as healthy, insisting assets should consolidate after a bullish outburst for sustainable upsides.As XRP consolidates, an analyst has updated the community on the asset’s current price action. In a December 30 post , MN Consultancy’s founder, Michael van de Poppe, provided sniper entries for XRP for maximum gains.XRP Remains the SameThe top strategist maintains that nothing remarkable has happened in the XRP chart. Notably, this aligns with an earlier assertion from analyst Egrag Crypto, who insisted that XRP remains on course despite the downtrend.Furthermore, Van de Poppe suggested that the XRPL native token is consolidating after a bullish outburst. For context, the digital asset surged over 400% in November following bullish macroeconomic factors like the resignation of U.S. SEC boss Gary Gensler and Donald Trump’s win .Meanwhile, the analyst mentioned price levels, which he suggested are optimal entry points. He marked the levels in an accompanying 1-day timeframe chart, connoting that XRP could rebound from the major support areas. Optimal XRP Entry Points Strategist Shares Ideal Higher Timeframe EntriesAccording to the analyst's chart, the support area around $1.8185 is a potential buy zone for XRP. Notably, the asset has rebounded twice from this area, reinstating the strong demand wall around this crucial support.For context, XRP bounced from the zone on December 10 after capitulating to an intraday low of $1.9010. Also, the digital asset repeated the same price action ten days later, rebounding from another low of $1.9584.Meanwhile, Van de Poppe pointed out that $1.5764 is another demand zone where bulls should consider buying XRP.

Matrixport: Ethereum Faces Uphill Battle for Price Growth Amid Low Ecosystem Activity and Strong Competition This, coupled with persistently low trading volumes, presents significant challenges for Ethereum (ETH) to achieve significant price appreciation in 2025. The decline in Ethereum’s gas fees, a metric typically associated with on-chain activity, highlights the decrease in network usage. Matrixport noted that the sluggish ecosystem activity reflects a slowdown in user engagement and raises concerns about Ethereum’s ability to maintain its dominance in the blockchain sector. Matrixport also noted the increasing competition Ethereum faces from alternative blockchain platforms like Solana and Sui. These emerging protocols are gaining traction and successfully attracting a wider user base through 2024 by offering faster and more cost-effective solutions. “The outperformance of Solana and Sui tokens compared to Ethereum throughout the year underscores the changing market dynamics,” Matrixport said. Without major catalysts or major upgrades, Ethereum is expected to remain under pressure in the coming year. Matrixport warned that rival projects will continue to expand their market share, further challenging Ethereum’s dominance. However, analysts believe that Ethereum’s robust developer ecosystem and established position could play a critical role in its long-term recovery if the platform effectively addresses its scalability and user engagement issues. *This is not investment advice.

In the latest instance, the billionaire has sent the price of meme coins inspired by a Grok-created meme soaring with an X stunt. Here's what's happening.Elon Musk Changes ProfileOver the past 24 hours, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has whipped up a frenzy with changes to his X profile. Specifically, he changed his profile name to Kekius Maximus and his display picture to a picture of the Grok-created meme.For the uninitiated, Kekius Maximus is a Grok-generated meme that combines the famous pepe meme with Gladiator's Maximus character. Screengrab of Elon Musks X profile Screengrab of Elon Musks X profile The meme had inspired several meme coins across the Ethereum and Solana blockchains, the oldest of which appeared to have launched 17 days ago. All of them have now soared to record highs following Elon Musk's X stunt. At the time of writing, the Solana version has risen by 16,000% over the past 24 hours, while the Ethereum version has risen by over 700% , per DEX Screener data. Each boasts market capitalizations of $1.6 million and $123 million, respectively.So what's happening, and why has Elon Musk changed this profile?Toying With Mainstream MediaDespite some reports suggesting that the move might be a sign of Musk's support for the meme coin, it appears to be part of a ploy to toy with mainstream news outlets following recent speculation that he has been using a burner account, ""Adrian Dittman,"" to praise and defend himself on the platform.Following the profile change, the billionaire has enjoyed laughs about mainstream media reporting the situation.https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1873982205099401489 The inspiration for the choice of the Kekius Maximus name appears to have come from an interaction with Alex ""ALX"" Lorusso, executive producer of the popular right-wing podcast The Benny Show.Amid the debate over Musk's ties to Adrian Dittman, Lorusso joked on Monday, December 30, that if the Tesla chief had an alternative account, it would be called ""Kekius Maximus or Biggus Dickus.""Musk responded to Lorusso's post, stating that his only alternative accounts were ""cybergamer"" and ""babysmurf9000,"" which he used to beta-test software. It is currently unclear if Lorusso has any significant ties to the Kekius Maximus meme coin beyond supporting it, perhaps for its ties to Pepe, which has controversial right-wing roots.

However, a new player, Lightchain AI (LCAI) , is turning heads with its explosive growth and innovative approach. Currently soaring by 160%, Lightchain AI has quickly gained traction in the market. Investors are particularly excited about its ongoing presale , which offers an early opportunity to join this rising star. While DOGE remains a go-to for its simplicity and widespread adoption, Lightchain AI’s mix of advanced technology and rapid momentum is positioning it as a top contender to watch in 2024. DOGE Gains Traction With Loyal Supporters Dogecoin’s rise as a cryptocurrency staple is a testament to the power of community-driven projects. The coin’s low transaction fees and ease of use have made it an appealing option for tipping, microtransactions, and retail adoption. Backed by a loyal fanbase and endorsements from prominent figures like Elon Musk, DOGE continues to gain traction, with an increasing number of holders entering the fold. Despite its enduring popularity, Dogecoin’s growth remains largely tied to market sentiment. With minimal technological advancements in recent years, DOGE relies on its meme status and community support to sustain its position in the crypto market. While this strategy has proven effective for maintaining relevance, it may limit its potential for long-term exponential growth. Lightchain AI Soars 160% Innovation Fuels Rapid Growth While Dogecoin consolidates its position, Lightchain AI (LCAI) is captivating the market with a stunning 160% growth surge. Currently priced at $0.0045 during its presale , Lightchain AI has raised over $6.28 million, showcasing strong investor confidence in its vision. Unlike DOGE, Lightchain AI is built on a foundation of advanced blockchain technology and artificial intelligence, targeting real-world challenges that go beyond transactional simplicity. One of the key drivers behind Lightchain AI’s growth is its decentralized AI framework, which enables secure, privacy-preserving computations on the blockchain. This innovative approach addresses inefficiencies in traditional AI systems, making it particularly attractive to enterprises and developers seeking scalable and intelligent automation solutions. Additionally, Lightchain AI’s focus on fostering an open-source ecosystem through incentives for contributors and developers has created a dynamic platform for growth. Its ability to bridge gaps across industries, from healthcare to logistics, sets it apart from purely speculative projects, giving it a strong foothold in the competitive crypto market. DOGE vs. Lightchain AI Tale of Two Growth Stories While both Dogecoin and Lightchain AI are experiencing market momentum, their paths to success are markedly different. DOGE thrives on community engagement and market sentiment, which can lead to short-term price spikes but offers limited utility beyond payments and tipping. In contrast, Lightchain AI is leveraging real-world applications and innovative technology to build a platform with long-term scalability and adoption potential. Its roadmap includes significant milestones such as collaborative AI model training and decentralized governance, ensuring that its growth is sustainable and adaptable. Lightchain AI’s recent 160% surge highlights its ability to attract both speculative and utility-driven investors, positioning it as a robust alternative to meme coins like DOGE. For those seeking both immediate gains and long-term prospects, Lightchain AI offers a compelling case. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Ethereum has yielded underwhelming gains compared to Bitcoin, and most altcoins ranked in the top 20 tokens by market capitalization The narrative could change in 2025 with catalysts like the upcoming Ethereum upgrade, accumulation by institutional investors, and other market movers. Table of Contents Ethereum gears for Pectra upgrade in 2025 Institutional investors accumulate Ether during dips US based Spot Ethereum ETFs could pass on staking yield Higher adoption among institutions, outside of token utility Technical analysis and targets Ethereum gears for Pectra upgrade in 2025 Ethereum could see a boost in scalability, security, and user experience with the upcoming Pectra upgrade, expected to go live in 2025. The upgrade will introduce enhancements in account abstraction, validator operations, and network performance. The goal is to improve both the user and developer experience on Ethereum and make future scalability upgrades easier to implement. Validator stake limits, staking withdrawals, and streamlined smart contract development could improve Ethereum’s network security and efficiency. This could have a domino effect on Layer 2 chains that rely on Ethereum for their security infrastructure. Pectra will be the third most significant upgrade in the Ethereum ecosystem after the Merge, and its successful execution could act as a catalyst for Ether’s recovery in 2025. Ethereum analyst Anthony Sassano estimates that the Pectra upgrade will go live next March or April. Notably, Unichain, an Ethereum-based protocol, set to launch its mainnet in early 2025, aims to use blobs, and Pectra’s improvements could help Ethereum meet Unichain’s scalability requirements. https://twitter.com/sassal0x/status/1874074854724690320 Institutional investors accumulate Ether during dips On-chain data intelligence platform Santiment shows a consistent increase in two key metrics: supply held by top non-exchange wallet addresses and the token’s top addresses as a percentage of total supply.

It can be used for programming applications and there must be a balance between Ethereum value and its utility as a form of payment and decentralized applications. I wouldn’t say there is a lag in price. What I think there is a lag in, is active development. And it is because it is the largest decentralized blockchain so it takes time to make changes, unlike Solana and other protocols that can be upgraded with no hassles.” Lo Buglio remains optimistic about Ethereum’s adoption among institutions for its smart contract functionality and underlying technology.

38350924,https://invezz.com/?p=2412652,1735658285,These 2 stocks beat Nvidia in 2024 gains: here’s where they could go in 2025,"Chipmaker Nvidia was all the rage in 2024, as the little known company went on to become one of the most valuable companies in the world, often taking the top spot. Nvidia’s share price soared more than 185% YTD , and was seen hovering around $137 on Tuesday. However, despite the stellar show, Nvidia is only third in the S&P 500’s list of top performing stocks of 2024. Palantir Technologies that specialises in software platforms for big data analytics, has seen a whopping 365% rise YTD, followed by Vistra Corp, that has risen by more than 267% this year. Here’s what analysts have to say about each of these stocks heading into 2025: Palantir: Palantir has gained from the hype around generative artificial intelligence as it was one of the early adopters of what we now know as AI. The company specializes in data analytics, processing vast amounts of information to uncover actionable insights and trends. This technology served as a foundation for the development of large language models (LLMs) that power platforms like ChatGPT. Among analysts polled by FactSet, Wedbush’s Dan Ives has consistently expressed confidence in the company’s ability to capitalise on the AI boom. He recently raised his target price to $75. The price of Palantir stood at $77.18 on Tuesday. Ives sees the company as well-positioned to replicate the success of software and cloud-computing giant Oracle in the AI era. On the the other hand, RBC Capital Markets’ Rishi Jaluria has a starkly lower target price of $11 for Palantir. His valuation is based on an enterprise value-to-revenue multiple of seven times his forecast for the company’s 2025 revenue, a sharp contrast to its current multiple of 33 times. Jaluria views Palantir’s risk-reward profile as “skewing unfavorable.” In his latest research note, he pointed out that the company’s recent earnings strength was heavily driven by government contracts, influenced by the timing of specific deals, while growth in its commercial segment has slowed. Vistra Corp. Vistra Corp, the integrated retail electricity and power generation company based in Irving, Texas. Vistra has capitalized on the surging electricity demand driven by AI data centers and cryptocurrency mining—an industry now consuming more energy than some entire nations. This demand is expected to persist and intensify with the ongoing transition to electric vehicles (EVs). While EV demand has proven less predictable than anticipated, the overall outlook for energy demand remains exceptionally strong, driving investors to the stock. Shares of the Texas based company have more than tripled in the trailing 12 months but is still cheaper than Constellation Energy at writing. Shahriar Pourreza is convinced that the company’s nuclear as well as gas assets are attractive to AI companies. I like Vistra because I don’t have to bet whether the next deal is going to be a nuclear plant or it’s going to be a gas plant. He went on to call Vistra stock his top pick for 2025 in his report. Pourreza’s $177 price target indicates potential for another 26% upside in VST from current levels. On the other hand Max Greve of Seeking Alpha believes over time, more consumers will move away form grid energy towards standalone-solar-storage. “I recognize that is a controversial view which many have taken exception to. But I still think we are more likely to see a grid-demand shift – higher from business, lower from consumers – than a massive grid-demand expansion,” he writes. This is why, he says, he has avoided not only Vistra but pretty much all electric grid stocks such as ConEd, Dominion, and NRG Energy. Obviously, that hasn’t served me well this year in the case of Vistra. And between the AI demand the potential EV expansions I certainly don’t recommend a short. But I am staying away from Vistra, despite its admitted short-term potential.

But will $FXG’s predicted gains put it ahead of BNB and HBAR? Stay tuned to know! >>JOIN FXGUYS HERE BNB Price Drops After Hitting New All-Time High BNB reached a new ATH of $794 on December 4, 2024. The token’s consistent ascent in 2024 reflects the increasing demand for BNB. Many people who hunt the top altcoins to buy find its performance appealing. One of the main factors of the recent BNB price surge was increased crypto trading volume. The price maintained an uptrend as more individuals utilized Binance’s offerings. However, since reaching its new ATH, BNB’s price has since dropped to $705. Although some analysts believe that BNB’s price might skyrocket to $900 in a few weeks, others are dubious about investing in BNB because of possible sell-offs from profit-taking investors. They believe this could drive BNB’s price below $650. Analysts Foresee Hedera’s Uptrend Ending Soon Hedera’s HBAR is currently trading at $0.31, up by 6.4% in the past seven days. On December 7, 2024, Hedera’s price rose to its three-year high of $0.37. Hedera’s commitment to technical innovation is one of the biggest drivers of HBAR’s growth.

38349148,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53534,1735658175,Williams Alligator Indicator Says XRP Remains Bullish Amid Current Downturn,"XRP continues to display bullish signals, even amid a broader bearish trend in the cryptocurrency market. Analysts closely monitor its performance, particularly with the Williams Alligator Indicator providing critical insights into the asset’s potential trajectory. The cryptocurrency surpassed the $2 mark earlier this month, a pivotal threshold for market sentiment. Despite retracing from a high near $3, the asset remains of interest due to its potential for sustained bullish momentum. Examining XRP’s Market Structure Analyst Egrag has drawn attention to the Williams Alligator Indicator, which uses three moving averages—Jaw, Teeth, and Lips—to assess market trends. According to Egrag, XRP’s current alignment of these moving averages supports a bullish outlook, provided the asset holds above the $2 equilibrium zone. #XRP – Williams Alligator Indicator : Analyzing the Williams Alligator: By Checking the angles of increase for the Williams Alligator (Jaw, Teeth, Lips) market momentum looks #Bullish . Check the parameters in the below chart If the three moving averages cross above… pic.twitter.com/02iWEgj0Eq — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) December 29, 2024 Egrag’s analysis highlights two critical “Break of Structure” (BOS) moments in XRP’s price history. The first occurred in early 2018 when XRP achieved its all-time high. The second attempt, in 2021, failed to break the previous record. Currently, a new BOS is emerging, with XRP maintaining its position above $2, signaling a potential continuation of the uptrend. Historical comparisons are particularly notable. The last time the Williams Alligator Indicator showed a similar alignment, was in late 2017 , XRP surged to an all-time high of over $3.80 by January 2018. However, Egrag emphasized the importance of forthcoming monthly candles. “The opening and closing of the subsequent candle will help solidify XRP’s trajectory,” he explained, noting that two-candle formations often provide stronger trading signals. He added that the current monthly candle appears bearish, underscoring the need for caution. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Significance of the $2 Support Level A key takeaway from Egrag’s analysis is the importance of the $2 support level . As long as XRP remains above this threshold, bullish sentiment is expected to persist. Both psychological and technical factors reinforce this level as a crucial marker for traders. Despite some challenges, XRP has repeatedly demonstrated resilience. Earlier this month, it briefly dipped below $2 twice, only to rebound strongly each time. These rebounds suggest buyers continue to defend this level, even as broader market conditions remain volatile. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.06, down 2.80% over the past 24 hours. While consecutive daily declines have raised concerns, the asset has thus far avoided significant breaches of the $2 support. With historical patterns providing context and current indicators suggesting optimism, XRP’s ability to maintain $2 as a strong support level will be a defining factor for its short-term prospects.

Lightchain AI (LCAI) , a decentralized platform that integrates artificial intelligence with blockchain technology, is quickly emerging as a frontrunner in the crypto market. With features like Proof of Intelligence (PoI) and the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), Lightchain AI is positioning itself as a game-changer, potentially outperforming long-standing projects like Tron (TRX), Ripple (XRP), and Polygon (MATIC). Tron, Ripple, and Polygon Have Strengths, But Their Growth Faces Limitations Tron (TRX), Ripple (XRP), and Polygon (MATIC) have carved out significant niches in the blockchain space. Tron excels in decentralized content sharing, Ripple is a leader in cross-border payments, and Polygon provides scalable solutions for Ethereum’s ecosystem. However, their growth trajectories are being challenged by new and versatile technologies. Tron has faced criticism for its centralized structure, which can limit innovation and developer engagement. Ripple’s ongoing legal battles create uncertainty for investors and its global adoption. Meanwhile, Polygon’s reliance on Ethereum leaves it vulnerable to competition from other Layer 2 scaling solutions. These factors have created a gap in the market, making room for advanced projects like Lightchain AI to capture investor attention. Lightchain AI’s Unique Technology Elevates Its Potential What sets Lightchain AI apart is its ability to integrate artificial intelligence into blockchain operations seamlessly. Its Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism is a groundbreaking feature that incentivizes nodes to perform valuable AI computations, such as training machine learning models and optimizing algorithms. This ensures the network's computational efforts are directly linked to advancing AI capabilities, unlike traditional consensus mechanisms that focus solely on transaction validation. The Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), another core feature, offers a computational layer optimized for AI-specific tasks. Supporting popular frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch, the AIVM allows developers to build and deploy decentralized AI applications with unmatched efficiency. By combining AI and blockchain technologies, Lightchain AI delivers a versatile and scalable solution that appeals to a broad range of industries. Why Lightchain AI is the Odds-On Favourite for Future Crypto Gains The overwhelming success of Lightchain AI’s presale , which raised over $6.28 million, highlights the growing confidence in its vision. Its roadmap is ambitious yet practical, moving from prototype development to a full-scale mainnet launch by 2025. Additionally, its decentralized governance framework empowers the community to drive the platform’s evolution, ensuring alignment with user needs. Unlike Tron, Ripple, and Polygon, Lightchain AI focuses on real-world applications, such as decentralized AI development, privacy-preserving data utilization, and open-source innovation. Its tokenomics further bolster investor confidence by incorporating deflationary mechanisms and dynamic pricing models that promote long-term value growth. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

38350923,https://invezz.com/?p=2413071,1735658005,"What were the most-searched money topics of 2024? A year of inflation, tariffs, and rising financial curiosity","Inflation dominated financial searches in 2024, reflecting widespread economic concerns, while tariffs, stock splits, and cryptocurrencies also captured significant public interest. A recent report from Investopedia revealed its “Terms of the Year,” highlighting the top ten money topics that drew readers’ attention on the finance-focused platform throughout the year. Inflation, taking the top spot, underscored a year where rising prices and slower economic growth were central to public discourse. “It was top of mind for everyone and even influenced the presidential election,” said Caleb Silver, Investopedia’s editor-in-chief, during an appearance on The Claman Countdown . Despite cooling inflation rates, consumers felt the pinch as goods remained expensive, further fueling searches on the topic. Tariffs, ranking second, gained momentum as trade policies became a hot election issue. Discussions surrounding tariffs surged following Donald Trump’s re-election, with many linking the topic to potential price hikes and economic shifts under his administration. Nvidia and stock splits garner market attention Nvidia, whose shares skyrocketed over 185% in 2024, secured the third position on the list. The chipmaker’s strong financial performance and a widely-anticipated stock split over the summer contributed to the buzz, with “stock split” earning fourth place in searches. Nvidia’s leadership in artificial intelligence and semiconductors kept investors glued to its movements. Debt, savings, and crypto maintain relevance The US national debt crossing $36 trillion pushed “national debt” to the fifth spot, reflecting growing concern over fiscal policy and economic stability. Other popular topics included “homeowners insurance,” “student loan forgiveness,” and “high-yield savings accounts,” which ranked sixth, seventh, and eighth, respectively, as Americans sought practical financial advice. Bitcoin, coming in ninth, demonstrated a resurgence of interest as cryptocurrency markets recovered in the latter half of the year. Silver noted that many new investors entered the crypto market post-election, drawn by a “less regulatory environment” and rising optimism in digital assets. Sports betting and financial trends converge Rounding out the top 10 was “moneyline bet,” reflecting the growing overlap between sports betting, financial markets, and political odds-making. The term gained traction as betting markets proved more accurate than polls during the presidential election, capturing public fascination.

38348881,https://crypto.news/?p=14323695,1735657934,Here’s why MicroStrategy stock and Bitcoin price have diverged,"MicroStrategy stock and Bitcoin price have historically had a close correlation as the company became the biggest BTC investor. MicroStrategy shares have dropped by 21% in the last 30 days, while Bitcoin ( BTC ) is down by less than 2%. This marks a significant divergence, as MSTR stock has typically moved in tandem with Bitcoin. Bitcoin vs MicroStrategy stock price | Source: crypto.news The stock has risen by over 320% this year, while Bitcoin has jumped by 120%. Its outperformance of Bitcoin, combined with the lack of an expense ratio, has led some investors to view it as a better alternative to BTC and spot Bitcoin ETFs. You might also like: 4 reasons Cardano price may explode higher in 2025 MSTR has continued to accumulate Bitcoins this year and currently holds 446,400 coins valued at over $42 billion. This figure is significantly lower than the company’s market cap of over $65 billion. The primary reason for the current divergence between Bitcoin and MicroStrategy stock is the company’s announcement of plans to issue 10 billion shares to fund new Bitcoin purchases. Its medium-term goal is to raise $42 billion through equity and fixed income between 2025 and 2027. According to Yahoo Finance , the company has 225 million outstanding shares, meaning the share count will increase by over 4,344%. Raising capital by issuing equity dilutes existing shareholders, reducing their ownership in the company. For a profit-making company, this also reduces earnings per share. In a detailed X thread, The Kobeissi Letter outlined the company’s predicament. Raising more equity dilutes existing shareholders, but if the share reauthorization fails, MicroStrategy will lack the funds to continue its Bitcoin acquisition strategy. Something doesn't add up here: MicroStrategy, $MSTR , has been known as the most popular ""levered"" #Bitcoin play of the year. Meanwhile, over the last month Bitcoin has gained +2% while $MSTR is currently down nearly -50%. What is happening? Let us explain. (a thread) — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) December 30, 2024 Despite these challenges, there is a strong likelihood that MicroStrategy’s shareholders will approve the share count increase. Michael Saylor, a key advocate for the plan, holds 46.8% of the outstanding shares. Saylor is highly respected by shareholders, who have witnessed the stock surge by nearly 2,000% in the past five years. MicroStrategy stock valuation reset Additionally, the decline in MicroStrategy stock may reflect the market adjusting its valuation premium, as the company is perceived to be highly overvalued by some. Specifically, MicroStrategy has an equity valuation of $65 billion, far exceeding the $42 billion value of its Bitcoin holdings. That valuation implies that its core technology business is valued at about $23 billion, which is unlikely. The most recent results showed that its software business generated $129 million in sales during the third quarter and reported a net loss of $8.4 million. The outlook for MicroStrategy stock in 2025 will depend heavily on Bitcoin’s performance. A rebound to a new all-time high for Bitcoin could drive further gains for MSTR stock as investors capitalize on the dip.

Yet, there is still a likelihood for further upside in the coming weeks. By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) The USDT Paired Chart On the daily chart of the ADA/USDT pair, the asset has gradually dropped since getting rejected from the key $1.3 resistance level. It is clear that a bearish trendline has been pushing the price lower on multiple occasions, but the $0.75 support level is still holding. Therefore, if the market is able to break the bearish trendline to the upside, another turn toward the $1.3 level and even higher could be expected. The BTC Paired Chart Looking at the ADA/BTC pair on the daily timeframe, things are quite similar to the USDT pair, with one significant distinction. The market has seemingly already lost the 1000 SAT level, as it is consolidating below it. With the price also creating a small head and shoulders pattern earlier, it is likely for the market to drop toward the 200-day moving average, located around the 700 SAT mark, in the short term. This scenario would be invalidated if the price could climb back above the 1000 SAT area.

But Rexas Finance , RXS, a fresh player, is here. Priced at $0.175, RXS achieves what ADA did in years, hitting $3 by combining innovation and market momentum in three months. This paper explores how RXS is pushing a new front in blockchain technology. The Journey of Cardano (ADA) to $3 Since the very start, Cardano (ADA) has had an amazing trip. ADA's price when it began openly trading in 2017 was just $0.02. Riding the 2017 crypto bull run, the token surged to $1.31 in less than ninety-six days. Like most cryptocurrencies, ADA dropped sharply in 2018, though. That year's November saw its price drop back to $0.02. ADA required over two years to surpass its previous high of $1.31, so the road to recovery was long and difficult. ADA reached this mark in early 2021 when a new bull market started. Still, the momentum continued. ADA hit $2.46 by the middle of May 2021; it then temporarily corrected itself in the summer. But this merely prepares the ground for expansion because ADA hit an all-time high in early September 2021 at $3.10. Although ADA has set vital pricing benchmarks, this trajectory shows that it took four years to reach its top of $3—a path defined by endurance and patience even if ADA has made significant progress. Rexas Finance (RXS): The New Competitor Although Cardano's successes are admirable, a new rival called Rexas Finance (RXS is redefining the rate of expansion in the cryptocurrency sector. At $0.175 right now, RXS is positioned as a game-changer with the possibility to hit the $3 mark in only three months—a feat ADA's four years of work have accomplished. Rexas Finance distinguishes itself as a transforming agent in the blockchain scene with its innovative approach to real-world asset tokenizing, which drives this fast momentum. Rexas Finance (RXS) fills the void between blockchain technology and actual assets. Users of its creative platform can tokenize practically any physical or intangible asset—from real estate and art to intellectual property and goods. This capacity streamlines ownership and increases access to worldwide investment prospects by enabling users to trade and own assets anywhere and at formerly unheard-of simplicity. Presale Success and Price Momentum Rexas Finance (RXS) has quite remarkable presale success. Having sold out its Stage 10 ahead of schedule, the token now in Stage 11 costs $0.175. Having raised around $33.65 million so far, the presale performance highlights RXS's great market confidence. Its obvious value offer and the team's strategic choice to prioritize community involvement above venture capitalists support this expansion. Rejecting VC money guarantees that the change RXS brings is inclusive and mostly helps early adopters and retail investors. Furthermore, Rexas Finance's legitimacy and visibility have been greatly enhanced by its listing on well-known sites such as CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. Together with the coin's performance, these listings have inspired investor trust and helped RXS become well-known as the next major participant in the crypto market. The Projection: $0.175 to $3 in Three Months Rexas Finance's (RXS) development path makes it among the most interesting coins available on the market. Experts estimate that RXS would rise astonishingly 1,615% to reach $3 in three months. Its innovative approach to asset tokenization, outstanding presale performance, and increasing appreciation of its worth among institutional investors and crypto enthusiasts help sustain its fast expansion. This prediction emphasizes RXS's possibilities and establishes a new standard for what the crypto market may produce. Its ecosystem's power and desire for use are shown by its ability to briefly soar from $0.175 to $3. RXS opens fresh possibilities for people and businesses by allowing the smooth tokenization of actual assets. The opportunities for the token's ecosystem are growing as its $3 aim approaches. Its creative approach and quick acceptance have already set it on a path to compete—and maybe even surpass—some of the most well-known companies in the sector. This offers investors a unique chance to join a movement changing the course of blockchain technology.

Kwon, a South Korean national, was turned over to US law enforcement, including FBI agents, at Podgorica airport. He faces charges of conspiracy to commit fraud tied to the collapse of Terraform Labs’ cryptocurrencies, TerraUSD and Luna, which caused an estimated $40 billion in investor losses and destabilized global crypto markets in May 2022. Do Kwon Extradited to US The latest news comes after the Constitutional Court of Montenegro unanimously rejected Kwon’s appeal challenging his extradition ruling last week. Kwon’s arrest in March 2023 at Podgorica airport occurred after months of evasion that included stops in South Korea and Singapore. He was caught attempting to fly to Dubai using a falsified Costa Rican passport. Terraform Labs gained prominence in 2021 as its Luna and TerraUSD cryptocurrencies surged in popularity. Kwon, on the other hand, earned a reputation as a controversial figure and a brash entrepreneur, labeling his 2018 cryptocurrency as his “greatest invention.” With backing from prominent investors such as Lightspeed Venture Partners and Galaxy Digital, he cultivated a devoted fanbase of “Lunatics” while he openly ridiculed critics. However, the ecosystem’s catastrophic failure in May 2022 obliterated over 99% of its value within two days, triggering a ripple effect that wiped hundreds of billions of dollars from the broader crypto sector. This crash eroded confidence in the industry and sparked massive regulatory scrutiny across the world. Legal Troubles Beyond the current US proceedings, Kwon also faces charges in South Korea, which had sought his extradition as well. Despite Montenegro’s lack of formal extradition treaties with either country, the justice ministry determined that the US request met the necessary legal criteria. Kwon, who denies wrongdoing, has been accused by US authorities of orchestrating a large-scale securities fraud that misled investors about TerraUSD’s stability and its integration with the Terraform blockchain. In February 2023, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against Kwon and Terraform Labs, wherein the agency cited their role in the market turmoil. They later agreed to a $4.5 billion settlement with the SEC. The extradition concludes an 18-month legal struggle and sets the stage for Kwon to face charges that may redefine accountability in the volatile cryptocurrency industry.

Down 1.29% from its last close, it trades at around $0.00002289 per coin as of December 25, 2024. Over the past year, it has declined greatly, hovering 72% below its all-time high. Reverting to the support level of $0.0000200, SHIB observed a significant 40% drop from a brief peak of $0.0000 334 on December 8, 2024. Market analysts see no changes soon; the potential high of $0.000038 by the end of 2024 is expected. Although this shows a 50% rise, meme coins' volatility and dubious future make sustainable development more difficult to project. Comparably, fueled mostly by anticipation and speculation, Pepe Coin (PEPE) saw a meteoric rise in 2023. Rising from its introduction price of $0.000000001 in April 2023, the coin peaked in December 2023 at $0.0000283. Pepe Coin has dropped dramatically, much like many other meme coins. PEPE is trading at about $0.00000075 as of December 2024, a startling 83% decline from its high. This emphasizes the natural volatility and risk involved in investing in meme currencies, which sometimes find difficulty staying valuable over time. Rexas Finance (RXS): A Novel Approach Rexas Finance (RXS) is an excellent substitute for the flux of meme currencies. Rexas Finance is a platform that tokenizes a broad spectrum of real-world assets, including intellectual property, art, commodities, and real estate, and it is not just a meme like Shiba Inu and Pepe Coin. This innovative strategy lets consumers invest in usually illiquid assets, generating fresh liquidity possibilities in marketplaces that are usually difficult to reach. The ability of Rexas Finance to tokenize practically everything paves the path for people to participate in fractional ownership of assets, enabling the general public to access high-value investments. This use case provides a strong basis for Rexas Finance to keep expanding and establish itself as a much more useful and practical initiative than meme coins without an obvious purpose. Rexas Finance has shown remarkable growth in its presale, now in Stage 11. The token is selling at $0.175—an amazing 483% increase from its starting price of $0.03 in Stage 1. Selling 382,252,023 tokens, the initiative has raised $33,607,003; about 42.25 million tokens remain in the presale. This great presale performance indicates that Rexas Finance is rising as a leading competitor in the altcoin market and shows growing confidence among investors. Rexas Finance has adopted a more community-oriented approach by letting normal investors actively engage in its expansion than many initiatives depending mostly on venture capital investment. Rexas Finance's fast price increase and increasing popularity can be attributed to the great momentum gained from this decentralization and inclusivity. In 2024, Rexas Finance strategically boosted its validity and profile. The initiative increased its readership by securing listings on important sites like CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. The project also passed a Certik audit, which is a crucial first step in establishing confidence and guaranteeing the security of its smart contracts. To raise its profile further, Rexas Finance started a $1 million RXS token giveaway campaign, in which 20 lucky winners would each receive $50,000 worth of RXS tokens. This marketing campaign generated over 657,947 entries and significant buzz. It raised awareness and promoted early adoption, highlighting Rexas Finance's special value in the cryptocurrency market. A Promising Future with High Price Predictions Rexas Finance intends to list its coins on important exchanges, so the token is expected to reach an all-time high by 2025. Analysts anticipate a 20,000% rise in the price of RXS by the end of 2025, raising its worth to about $35. Given the ongoing interest in real-world asset tokenization and Rexas Finance's strategic approach, this token is positioned to see explosive development well above the highs of Shiba Inu and Pepe Coin. For those looking for a safer and more profitable alternative to the volatility of meme currencies, Rexas Finance presents a bright future ahead. With its real-world application case, great presale performance, and bright future, Rexas Finance is set to rank among the top altcoins in 2025 and beyond.

Table of Contents Can Cardano hit $4.20 by January 31? Lightchain AI $0.004 challenger with huge potential Who will win the race to greater gains? The cryptocurrency market is heating up as Cardano strives to maintain its position as a top-tier blockchain platform. With investors eyeing a potential price surge to $4.20 by January 31, the spotlight has also turned to Lightchain AI, a rapidly emerging competitor priced at just $0.004 in its presale. Both projects have their strengths, but Lightchain AI’s new approach and explosive early success have many wondering if it could outpace Cardano’s growth trajectory in the months ahead. Can Cardano hit $4.20 by January 31? Cardano has made its name as a chain that looks at lasting use and strong study. Its proof-of-stake way and smart deal features have turned it into a key choice for shared money and more apps. But, while Ca͏rdano’s basics stay strong its price moves slowly than hoped for with use and growth of the system not keeping up with some new rivals. For Cardano to hit $4.20 it would need a mix of more users major deals and fresh trust from investors. While not out of the question getting to such a price in short time needs boosts that are not here now like big changes or a jump in network use. Lightchain AI $0.004 challenger with huge potential While Cardano focuses on long-term development, Lightchain AI is making waves with its presale success, having raised over $7 million so far. This trending competitor offers a unique blend of blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI), making it one of the most exciting projects in the space. Unlike Cardano, which primarily targets decentralized finance and sustainability, Lightchain AI is designed for broader applications across industries, including healthcare, logistics, and enterprise-level solutions. Investors are drawn to Lightchain AI’s potential for exponential growth. At just $0.004 per token, the project provides an accessible entry point. Its strong early-stage performance suggests significant upside potential.

The race between Cardano and Lightchain AI is more than just a price comparison, it’s a reflection of differing strategies and market positioning. Cardano relies on its established reputation and existing ecosystem, while Lightchain AI offers the promise of innovation and rapid growth. For investors, the choice comes down to priorities. Cardano provides a more stable investment with proven use cases, while Lightchain AI offers high-risk, high-reward potential as an early-stage project with a disruptive vision.

While Dogecoin (DOGE) and PEPE have established themselves as meme coin powerhouses, their holders are now turning their attention to Lightchain AI (LCAI), a rising star in the cryptocurrency market. With analysts projecting a staggering 30,000x growth potential, Lightchain AI is making waves as a project with unparalleled innovation and scalability, offering a unique opportunity for both seasoned investors and newcomers. Dogecoin and PEPE Reigning Meme Coin Favorites Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to shine as the original meme coin, boasting a loyal community and widespread recognition. Its low transaction fees and accessibility make it a go-to option for tipping and small-scale transactions. However, as Dogecoin matures, its growth trajectory has slowed, with market sentiment playing a more significant role than technological advancement. Similarly, PEPE, a newer entrant in the meme coin space, gained rapid popularity with its playful branding and viral appeal. While PEPE saw explosive early growth, its reliance on community-driven hype has left investors seeking projects with more substantial long-term potential. Both DOGE and PEPE have demonstrated the power of community, but their lack of innovative utility has sparked a shift in focus toward projects like Lightchain AI . Lightchain AI Technological Powerhouse With Real-World Applications Lightchain AI (LCAI) is redefining the cryptocurrency landscape by combining blockchain with artificial intelligence to solve real-world challenges. Unlike DOGE and PEPE, which thrive on speculative trading, Lightchain AI is built to deliver tangible value across industries such as data analytics, logistics, and autonomous decision-making. One of Lightchain AI’s standout features is its ability to process complex AI computations securely and efficiently, making it a perfect fit for enterprises seeking decentralized AI solutions. The platform’s developer-friendly ecosystem fosters innovation by empowering contributors to create intelligent applications that address industry-specific problems. Priced at just $0.0045 during its presale , Lightchain AI has already raised over $6.28 million, a testament to its strong market appeal. Why Lightchain AI Captures Meme Coin Enthusiasts’ Attention For Dogecoin and PEPE holders, Lightchain AI offers an enticing blend of high growth potential and real-world utility. Analysts predict an impressive 30,000x growth potential for Lightchain AI, surpassing the speculative returns of DOGE and PEPE. Its scalable, modular architecture ensures adaptability across industries with diverse computational demands, making it a standout in the blockchain space. With a presale price of just $0.0045, Lightchain AI provides an accessible entry point for both small-scale and institutional investors, fostering a diverse and engaged community. Unlike meme coins, Lightchain AI goes beyond speculation by integrating AI and blockchain technologies, ensuring its relevance and adoption across multiple sectors while securing a strong competitive edge. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Musk AI King (MUSKAI), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKAI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk AI King can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk AI King could become the next viral memecoin. Musk AI King launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk AI King on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk AI King by entering its contract address – 8hfjjhqWbfVZsqxCKVQu115AXUzUPTHZFXZwk81rYTMw – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKAI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/solana-memecoin-musk-ai-king-muskai-to-skyrocket-16000-ahead-of-first-exchange-listing-while-dogecoin-and-bonk-underperoform/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

QCP noted that the market experienced a predictable decline in volatility following the record-breaking options expiration last Friday. “Volatility has since dropped by 2-3 points,” the analyst firm said. Despite BTC consolidating near the lower end of its one-month range and posting modest returns in December, the BTC price has been a strong overall performer in the fourth quarter. While December returns were lackluster, QCP suggested that recent activity, including Bitcoin purchases by Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy, could point to further price support. According to the analytics firm, Saylor’s newly released BTC purchase tracker points to the potential for more buying. Related News: It Was Hacked This Year: Developers of Binance-Listed Altcoin Release Statement on the Latest Situation QCP has taken a cautious short-term view, predicting that prices will remain calm in the coming weeks. “While there could be another round of buying, we don’t expect much in the New Year,” the firm said. Historically, average January returns (+3.3%) have been relatively close to December (+4.8%), and QCP expects BTC prices to remain in the range until February, when market activity traditionally begins to pick up. *This is not investment advice.

Rexas Finance (RXS) is leading among several coins fighting for investor interest. Priced simply at $0.175, this cryptocurrency has already shown unmatched potential with an excellent presale performance. Analysts estimate it will yield an incredible 10,000% return, so they value it at $17.50 long before giants like Solana (SOL) hit $1,000 or Ripple (XRP) hit $15. Here's why RXS is the most intriguing prospect available to investors. The Unmatched Rise of Rexas Finance Rexas Finance is a groundbreaking platform that is changing blockchain ecosystems, not just another crypto token. In its 11th presale stage, RXS has sold over 382.6 million tokens and raised an impressive $33.5 million. Starting at $0.03, the presale price has increased nearly six times, demonstrating increasing investor belief in its promise. Priced at $0.175, the presale stage offers early adopters a unique opportunity to enter before the coin's value skyrockets. Unlike many speculative assets, RXS is supported by real-world use cases such as Token Builder and Launchpad, enabling users to start and implement blockchain initiatives quickly. Rexas Finance is also developing a position in the growing crypto industry real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. RXS allows fractional ownership by tokenizing assets like real estate and commodities, improving worldwide access. Rexas financing is positioned, thanks to this original idea, as a pioneer in combining blockchain technology and conventional financing. Solana (SOL): A Giant with Slower Growth Due to its speed and scalability, Solana (SOL) has emerged as an important competitor in the blockchain ecosystem, trading currently at around $198.11 and likely to surpass $1000 in the coming years. However, SOL would need a 5x gain from its present price to reach this milestone, a notable but slower growth rate than RXS. Rexas Finance appeals to investors looking for exponential profits since it provides a far better upside potential at a far lower cost. Solana keeps innovating, but its well-known status in the market causes its growth curve to be less steep than that of newly started initiatives like RXS. Ripple (XRP): A Regulatory Battle Slows Momentum Still, a major player in the crypto scene, Ripple (XRP), especially concerning cross-border transactions, is Although its continuous legal battles with the SEC have generated volatility, they have not deterred institutional investors from picking it up. Though forecasts of XRP reach $15 in the future, it is now trading at $2.29. Still, XRP's growth path is limited by its notable market size and legal obstacles. Although its use cases are growing, there are few chances for innovative returns like those presented by RXS. Why RXS Outpaces SOL and XRP For various reasons, Rexas Finance is the best high-growth token available. Massive Upside Potential At just $0.175, RXS presents early investors with an unmatched chance to ride its expected ascent to $17.50, reflecting a 10,000%. Innovative Ecosystem Rexas Finance is positioned as a hub for distributed innovation with tools like the Token Builder and Launchpad included. These qualities draw investors, startups, and developers, promoting long-term development. Real-World Asset Tokenization Real-world asset tokenization presents a multi-trillion-dollar market potential, and Rexas is leading this transformation. Its capacity to link conventional and digital finance qualifies it wildly to profit from this new trend. Community and Visibility Already shown on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, RXS has become somewhat well-known. Engagement of the increasing community of investors in the project guarantees continuous interest and acceptance. Strong Financial Backing With $33.5 million raised, Rexas Finance has the resources to implement its ambitious road map, which includes partnerships, exchange listings, and ecosystem building. The Path to $17.50 Strategic execution, creative use cases, and market demand all contribute to Rexas Finance's expected growth to $17.50 within the next several months. Analysts are projecting a flood of institutional and retail interest as the token prepares for its exchange debut, which will speed up its development. For those trying to maximize returns in the near term while obtaining a great long-term asset, RXS is the go-to token since this expected rally will probably surpass the trajectories of Solana and Ripple. Why Timing Matters The crypto market is quite volatile, and chances sometimes vanish as quickly as they first appear. Priced at $0.175, RXS is in its 11th presale stage. Hence, early gains are quickly closing under control. The token's price is expected to grow significantly if it moves into significant exchanges, possibly leaving latecomers running to catch up. ⭐️ Milestone Alert! ⭐️Rexas Finance has successfully raised $34.9 Million! 🚀Thank you for your support! 👍Buy Now: https://t.co/tNJAsvBiYe #rexas $RXS #RexasFinance #crypto pic.twitter.com/LI8sOctzK8 — Rexas Finance (@rexasfinance) December 30, 2024 Conclusion Rexas Finance presents a rare mix of creativity, accessibility, and development potential for investors looking for the next great opportunity in cryptocurrency.

PEPE is also up by 9% in the past week, and while it is down by 6.5% in a month, it remains up by a very healthy 1,350% in the past year. This underlines the kind of momentum PEPE has enjoyed in 2024, and with whales still showing plenty of interest in the coin, its 2025 price predictions are strong as well. Pepe Bounces Back as Meme Coins Recover – Is the Worst Finally Behind Us? The token has suffered along with the rest of the market in recent weeks, with traders taking profits in the wake of the exuberant post-US election rally. Yet it’s likely that PEPE and most other cryptos have hit bottoms already, with PEPE’s chart today showing a renewal in short-term momentum. We see PEPE’s RSI (yellow) rising to 73 this morning, a sign of strong buying pressure after several days of poor performance. What’s also significant is that the token has also witnessed a sudden lift in trading volume, which has risen from $1.2 billion to $3.5 billion in a matter of hours today. This is indicative of whale interest, with many of the recent PEPE whales continuing to hold the token in significant quantities . Whales are buying $PEPE ! 9 wallets(likely belonging to the same whale) spent 13.8M $DAI to buy 555B $PEPE in the past 2 hours, with an average buying price of $0.000025.

And looking into the more distant future, the next few months could bring significant gains for PEPE. This is particularly the case if the new Trump administration (and Republican-controlled Congress) pass positive cryptocurrency legislation, as suggested by Republican lawmakers recently . If so, we may see PEPE reach $0.000025 by the end of January, and $0.000040 by Q2 2025. New High-Utility Meme Coins Could Outperform in 2025 PEPE is likely to remain popular in 2025, yet its strong gains this year could mean that it doesn’t rally quite as vigorously over the next 12 months. If so, many traders may prefer to diversify into newer coins, including presale tokens, which can often rally big when they list. One of the most promising of these is new ERC-20 meme coin Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) , which has raised a hefty $38.5 million in its hugely popular token offering. $35M raised. Frogs are thriving. Energy’s high. Stay ready, stay focused, stay green. pic.twitter.com/qdYWgKVn2X — Wall Street Pepe (@WEPEToken) December 23, 2024 Wall Street Pepe is much more than another meme token, with the project planning to launch a trading intelligence platform. Accordingly, WEPE holders will gain exclusive access to buying signals, real-time analysis and insider trading strategies, while they will also be able to compete in community-based trading competitions. The winners of these competitions will earn rewards in WEPE, while the token will also be open to staking, making it a very lucrative asset. Investors can join its sale by going to its official website , where it’s currently available at $0.0003661. This price will continue to rise fractionally with each successive stage of the sale, while it could potentially explode once it lists on exchanges.

Developed by Tokyo-based Jasmy Corporation, this cryptocurrency project combines Internet of Things (IoT) technology with blockchain to give users full control over their personal information. The Jasmy platform creates a secure space for users to store and share data between devices like computers, phones, and cars. By connecting service providers and data users, it allows personal data to become a valuable asset owned by individuals. JasmyCoin has the potential to reshape how we think about data privacy and ownership.

While the crypto market is volatile, projects like JasmyCoin that address real-world issues may have strong appeal. For investors looking for coins with practical applications and a strong mission, JasmyCoin might be an attractive option. Floki Inu (FLOKI) Elon Musk’s playful tweet in June 2021 about naming his Shiba Inu “Floki” sparked more than just smiles—it ignited the creation of the Floki Inu coin. What began as a meme coin has blossomed into a multifaceted cryptocurrency known simply as Floki. Beyond its quirky origins, Floki aims to make a real-world impact by providing utility and promoting charitable causes. The community has funded the building of schools in less developed countries like Laos and Nigeria, showcasing a commitment to global betterment. Recognized by The Economic Times as one of the top meme coins to watch in 2023, Floki continues to expand its ecosystem and influence. Floki sets itself apart by offering a range of innovative projects that enhance its usefulness. The NFT metaverse game Valhalla merges gaming with crypto, while its DeFi platform FlokiFi expands financial services within the ecosystem. Partnerships like the one with NOWPayments and the introduction of the prepaid Floki Card enable FLOKI tokens to be used for real-world transactions, bridging the gap between digital assets and everyday use. This diversification into NFTs, DeFi, and practical utility distinguishes Floki from other meme coins that remain mere speculative assets. In a market where utility and real-world applications drive value, Floki’s strategic developments make it an attractive option for those looking beyond the hype.

Offering investors an opportunity evocative of the early days of BTC and ETH, RXS is establishing itself as the next transforming force in the crypto scene with a presale price of $0.175 and unmatched growth potential. Echoes of Bitcoin and Ethereum’s early growth The unmatched expansion of Bitcoin and Ethereum has generated millionaires in their wake. From a modest $0.0008 in 2009, Bitcoin surged to $1,000 by 2013, raising its value by an incredible 124,900%. First sold on the market in 2015 at $0.3, Ethereum rose to $1,400 by early 2018—a 466,500% increase. Rexas Finance (RXS) reflects early technology innovation trends and community-driven adoption. By tokenizing actual assets and tying DeFi to real estate, RXS is accessing markets worth trillions of dollars. With a 485% price growth from the first stages and a presale raising $33.5 million, Rexas Finance shows a trajectory that might equal Ethereum’s early years. In their early years, investors who identified significant potential in Bitcoin and Ethereum made enormous profits. With its presale price of $0.175 opening the path for exponential expansion, Rexas Finance now presents a comparable ground-floor possibility. Early adopters could experience significant financial rewards if RXS reaches even a quarter of the success shown by Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Its cheap starting price offers early adopters an unmatched chance to maximize returns as demand spikes.

To read full editions, subscribe . If there’s one thing ParaFi wants you to know, it’s that it’s not like other venture capital firms. ParaFi Technologies, the tech infrastructure arm, helps make it stand out against the rest of the pack. Outside of the well-known venture capital arm, ParaFi Technologies has validator systems running with over $1 billion in assets staked, operating as an Ethereum validator in addition to Aptos and Solana. “In a simple sense, we’re an investment and technology firm,” ParaFi partner Kevin Yedid-Botton told me. “We really view ourselves as a public utility provider to the blockchain ecosystem.” “From a purely business perspective, our revenue is diversified. We’re not dependent on a single stream of revenue from a single fund. We have our quant fund, we have our venture fund, we have our token fund, and we have these other auxiliary businesses, the GP business and the technology business,” he further explained. One big benefit — outside of revenue — that Yedid-Botton found in ParaFi’s approach to their multi-business structure is that there’s open communication between the teams, who all have different skill sets. From engineers to legal, ranging from really crypto native to not-so-crypto native, Yedid-Botton thinks the firm created a “unique combination” to “find alpha in ways other firms can’t.” While a bull market has its own set of difficulties, bear markets are, well, a beast to survive. Yedid-Botton said that the firm saw assets under management “compression from prices going down but our quant fund was actually flat to up that year.” Which he noted was an example of “how, despite certain strategies underperforming, because we have a platform of strategies, we’re able to mute the volatility and the cycles that the market gives you because we’re diversified. “Today, that’s even more true, because even in 2022 to be intellectually honest, we were in the early stage of setting up what the ParaFi of today looks like. We didn’t have as big of a business” as they do now. Despite the bearish vibes we saw just last week, though, it’s pretty clear that the bullish cycle isn’t exhausted just yet. For ParaFi, this next cycle is going to be focused on growing the existing businesses. With over $1 billion in assets under management, Yedid-Botton says ParaFi plans to do over 5x that in the next few years. “I don’t see you know why we couldn’t be at a five to $10 billion-plus easily. And we have a very unique LP based too, that is mostly institutional, mostly family office … from a technology standpoint, as a firm, I think we’re going to cement [our] flag and say ParaFi is not just a VC firm.” See, mom, they’re not just an investment and technology firm, they’re a cool investment and technology firm.

Its novel value proposition is perhaps what has made it stand out from a growing crowd of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and meme coins as the project allows creators to monetize their AI agents through tokenization. Co-ownership of AI Agents is now live on @base , powered by #VIRTUAL Buy, trade and create AI Agents now at https://t.co/eNr7UssUfw Here’s how to get started: pic.twitter.com/VO2lfN1MKm — Virtuals Protocol (@virtuals_io) October 16, 2024 As a result of this latest surge, the market cap of $VIRTUAL has increased to $3.77 billion while trading volumes in the past 24 hours stand at $322 million. $VIRTUAL is a utility token that allows users to create the AI chatbots by using the project’s proprietary platform. These agents have been primarily conceived for the entertainment, gaming, and ecommerce industry as they can interact with followers and fans via social media networks to boost engagement. The Virtuals protocol aims to develop an ecosystem where the top AI agents can be monetized by their creators by sharing the revenue they produce with users who opt to rely on these pre-designed bots rather than building their own from scratch. Some agents created with the Virtuals have already become valuable tokens by themselves. This is the case of Prefrontal Cortex Convo Agent and G.A.M.E. both of which boast market caps exceeding $100 million already. As artificial intelligence continues to be rapidly and widely adopted by organizations and individuals to optimize processes, increase productivity, and other similar goals, the decentralized nature of the Virtuals platform could be an enticing feature that attracts users to its ecosystem. Revenue-sharing is currently not possible with the majority of the platforms that offer the possibility of creating customized AI chatbots. This is where Virtuals probably holds an edge. In addition, tokenization eliminates the need for an intermediary for billing and other purposes. $VIRTUAL Shows Parabolic Formation that Could Result in a Spike in Volatility The price of $VIRTUAL have increased so rapidly that it has formed a parabolic ascending price channel. This price pattern is typically the result of significant short-term gains that are accompanied by significant upward and downward volatility. The latest push from bulls has managed to propel $VIRTUAL above its $3.30 resistance and could push it near the $5 mark in the following days. However, it is worth noting that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is exhibiting a bearish divergence that could be interpreted as a signal of an upcoming pullback. Bearish divergences occur when the price of the asset climbs to a higher high while the RSI line posts a lower high. What this means in simple words is that the same level of momentum that the token experienced in a previous rally is now fading and that could result in buyers capitulating and sellers taking over the price action in short notice. For now, the most relevant support level to watch would be the $3 mark as this is an important psychological and technical threshold that has served as both resistance and support in previous instances. In addition, the RSI is coming off oversold levels, which means that market participants may be getting ready to take some profits after the most recent spike. Just 24 Hours Left to Buy This Promising Layer-Two Solana Token in Presale The Solaxy presale is still up and running and investors continue to pour thousands of dollars every day on its native token while it is available at such an attractive price. This promising layer-two network for the Solana mainnet promises to alleviate congestion and reduce errors and delays to zero by using an innovative mechanism that bundles transactions offline safely and cheaply. Solaxy responds to the significant pressure that the Solana network has been facing as meme coins have become more and more popular among investors. Millions of the transactions involving these assets now need to be processed by the mainnet every day and this has put validators’ ability to keep up to the test. The presale event for $SOLX has already raised $7.2 million from investors as the Solana community understands the potential for this protocol to become the next Arbitrum or Optimism of the Solana ecosystem. https://x.com/SOLAXYTOKEN/status/1873760053267939739 At its current price of $0.001586, $SOLX offers an attractive opportunity for traders as it offers significant upside potential and little downside risk. After this 24-hour period concludes, the token will be sold at a higher price. To buy $SOLX now, go to the Solaxy website and connect your wallet to convert USDT or ETH tokens. In addition, you can opt to use a bank card in case you don’t own any crypto at the moment. $SOLX offers attractive staking rewards of 524% at the moment for holders who will be rewarded right after the token is listed. Don’t wait any longer, the presale could end soon and this L2 token will not be available at this price once it moves to that stage.

38347626,https://crypto.news/?p=14323665,1735655244,4 reasons Cardano price may explode higher in 2025,"Cardano’s price remains in a technical bear market, but there are three key reasons why the coin could rebound in 2025. Cardano ( ADA ) appears poised to end the year trading at $0.870, down about 35% from its 2024 high but there are several catalysts to reverse recent losses in 2025. First, Cardano will integrate with BitcoinOS in 2025, opening a $1.5 trillion market opportunity. This integration is expected to enhance liquidity within Cardano’s decentralized finance ecosystem, potentially driving an increase in total value locked. Cardano’s TVL has historically lagged behind popular blockchains like Solana and Base. You might also like: Cardano co-founder explores Delimited continuations: What does it mean for Cardano? ADA appears to be undervalued based on its Market Value to Realized Value. Data from IntoTheBlock shows the MVRV has dropped from a high of 1.90 earlier this month to 1.30. Bitcoin MVRV indicator | Source: IntoTheBlock The MVRV ratio compares a cryptocurrency’s current market value to its realized value and is a widely used valuation metric. Assets below an MVRV of 3.90 are considered fairly valued, indicating room for growth in ADA’s price. Further, the Midnight mainnet is set to launch in 2025, with its testnet already underway. Midnight is a privacy-focused project utilizing zero-knowledge proofs. Cardano Stake Pool Operators will play a critical role in securing block production and enhancing data security, which could positively impact ADA’s value ahead of its launch. Cardano price has strong technicals ADA price chart | Source: crypto.news The fourth reason why Cardano may rebound in 2025 is that it has strong technicals. On the daily chart, the coin has retreated by almost 35% from its highest level this year. It has moved below the top of the trading range support level of the Murrey Math Lines tool. Cardano has also fomed a falling wedge chart pattern, one of the most bullish signs in the market. This pattern is made up of two falling trendlines that are converging. With the two trendlines nearing their convergence, there is a likelihood that the coin is about to have a strong rebound soon. Cardano has remained above the 100-day Exponential Moving Average and the 50% Fibonacci Retracement point. Therefore, the outlook for the ADA price is bullish, with the initial target being at the year-to-date high of $1.326, followed by the psychological point at $2.

With a notable rise in the buying pressure, the star token is believed to revamp a strong rise ahead of the yearly close. Besides, there has been a significant growth in the institutional demand and as a result, the exchange reserve has been facing a massive drain. The BTC exchange reserves have been depleting since the start of the year and the current has reached levels not seen since 2016. This could be a major bullish signal but with nearly a million BTC being held with the institutions, they may play a major role in the next price action. Meanwhile, the price is attempting to rise above the ongoing consolidation and a bullish close above a certain range may revamp a strong bull run towards the highs of the ongoing bull run. The historical price pattern, which remains consolidated within a rising parallel channel, suggests the price is in between a bull run. The RSI pattern suggests there is still more room for the token to swell as the levels are yet to rise above 90. During each bull run in 2014, 2018 or 2021, the monthly RSI marked the highs close to 94. While the current levels have been restricted at 76 or 77, that indicates the peak of the ongoing bull run is yet to be reached. Meanwhile, the levels remain within the overbought zone, which keeps up the bullish perspective for the token. The BTC price has reclaimed $95,000 ahead of the yearly close with a rise of over 3% while the weekly trade remains within the bearish range. However, there has been a massive rise in the stablecoin reserve that reaches $45 billion. Therefore, the upcoming price action in January 2025 is expected to be explosive, with an expectation of achieving $120K.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/top-reason-why-bitcoin-bull-run-is-yet-to-mark-the-peak-btc-price-primed-to-reach-115k-before-entering-the-bear-market/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Comparatively, revenue grew 115.73% year-on-year to hit $2.12 billion in 2024. The growth puts Tron in the ranks of the most profitable networks in the cryptocurrency space. Its easy-to-use nature and cost-effectiveness have attracted both users and developers. Tron network relies on decentralized applications for growth The Tron network has a very active memecoin platform, Sunpump. The platform was a major contributor to Tron’s revenue growth. Since its launch, it has raised $8.4 million. In the decentralized applications (dApps) space, Tron has excelled, particularly within the DeFi and gaming sectors. Its affordability, high throughput, and user-centric approach have boosted its appeal, driving substantial traffic to the blockchain. Moreover, Tron has dominated the stablecoin market as the second largest player, accounting for over 34% of the market, with approximately $58.56 billion . The network has a loyal and vibrant community held together by its staking program, which rewards users for participating in network validation and governance. Tron revenue came second to Ethereum 2024 turned out to be an exceptional year for Tron. Among the top blockchains, only Ethereum eventually ranked higher than Justin Sun’s network. Solana came third in the rankings. At one point during Q3 of 2024, Tron outperformed Ethereum by nearly half. Tron’s growth has been consistent in 2024. The last two quarters have seen the blockchain gain more revenue. The network seems to be gaining many positive patterns, which indicates that by 2025, it may end up breaking several ceilings. Amid the prevailing market optimism driving Bitcoin’s price surge, Tron has notably outperformed major assets like Ethereum, which recorded only an 11% increase during the same period. However, with crypto market volatility, Tron’s future performance remains uncertain . Also, other networks will try to rise to the top, leaving no room for laxity. The crypto regulation environment could also cause trouble for Tron, but that remains to be seen.

38347630,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=635431,1735654942,Germany just won’t let Eurozone economy be great,"Germany’s economy is dragging the entire Eurozone into the mud, and it’s not even trying to climb out. The so-called engine of Europe has stalled, sputtered, and now threatens to collapse altogether. Five years of stagnation have left the country’s economy 5% behind expectations. Business leaders are screaming for solutions. Everyday people are feeling the pinch, losing about €2,500 ($2,600) annually in real income. But politicians? They’re still stuck, fiddling while Berlin burns. The problems are deeply rooted structural issues that Germany seems incapable of fixing. Cheap Russian energy? Gone. Iconic automakers like Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz? Scrambling to keep up with China. Manufacturing, Germany’s pride and joy, is hemorrhaging jobs. Exports have flatlined, domestic investments are drying up, and social tensions are bubbling. And that’s just Germany. The economic rot is spreading across Europe, dragging the Eurozone down with it. Germany’s manufacturing meltdown The loss of cheap energy has crippled energy-intensive industries in Germany, forcing companies to scale back or shut down. Export levels, stuck at 2019 figures, show no signs of recovery. This year, manufacturing output dipped another 0.4%. Automakers like Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz, once untouchable icons of engineering, are struggling to compete with China’s fast-moving electric vehicle industry. And investment in Germany is almost non-existent now. Companies are too spooked by uncertainty to pour money into new ventures. Equipment investments are still below pre-pandemic levels. And while overall inflation fell to 2.5% in 2024, core inflation rose to 3.0%, driven by higher costs for services and food. Energy prices dropped by 3.7%. The labor market offers no real relief. Employment levels have risen slightly, but unemployment is creeping up too. Real disposable incomes have improved a bit, but households remain cautious. People are saving instead of spending, fearing what lies ahead. Economic uncertainty is the new normal. Economic forecasts look bleak Germany’s GDP is shrinking. The Bundesbank projects a 0.2% contraction in 2024, following a 0.3% drop in 2023. That’s two consecutive years of negative growth. Growth is expected to crawl back at 0.2% in 2025, then inch up to 0.8% in 2026 and 0.9% in 2027. Even those figures feel overly optimistic given Germany’s current trajectory. The country’s structural problems are deep and worsening. An aging population means fewer workers, while high energy costs keep hammering industries that need lots of power. Competition from China is another huge problem. Germany’s traditional industries—especially automotive manufacturing—are losing their global edge. The government has yet to roll out any effective strategies to address these issues. Snap elections in February 2024 could bring some change, but analysts are skeptical. So don’t expect miracles. U.S. trade policies: A new headache If Germany’s domestic problems weren’t bad enough, trade tensions with the U.S. are adding to it. President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to impose tariffs of up to 20% on all imports into the U.S., with rates on Chinese goods climbing as high as 60%. These policies would be the largest rise in American protectionism since the Great Depression. For Europe—and especially Germany—it’s a disaster waiting to happen. You see, the “sick man of Europe” has a massive trade surplus with the U.S., and Trump’s tariffs would hit it hard. A Financial Times poll found that 69% of economists believe a trade war is likely, and 68% see it as the biggest threat to the Eurozone in 2025. The fallout is already being felt. Companies are delaying investments, waiting to see how Trump’s policies unfold. Tomasz Wieladek of T. Rowe Price explains that the mere expectation of tariffs is enough to scare businesses. On average, economists expect the Eurozone to grow by just 0.9% in 2025. That’s the third year of subpar performance, and it’s even below the European Central Bank ’s December prediction of 1.1%. While most analysts agree a recession can be avoided, there’s little optimism for anything better than mediocrity. Some analysts believe Europe has the tools to fight back. With decades of experience in trade negotiations, the EU is still one of the world’s largest trading blocs. But some warn that negotiating with Trump could backfire. Other threats are coming from within. U.S. tax cuts, deregulation, and lower energy prices are making America a more attractive place to do business than Europe.

38347411,https://finbold.com/?p=224592,1735654800,Will Trump’s inauguration day be a ‘sell the news’ event for crypto? Analysts weigh in,"Donald Trump’s victory in the presidential elections sparked a bullish sentiment among crypto investors, looking forward to the inauguration day . However, after an impressive rally, cryptocurrencies are cooling off and raising concerns of a possible “sell the news” event. Crypto analysts have weighed in on this matter, warning of a visible market fatigue , and potential top signals. Among these analysts, Arthur Hayes believes that investors’ expectations for Trump’s administration may be misaligned to reality. “I think there exists a wide gap between crypto investor’s high expectations for how quickly Trump can change things and the reality that there are no politically acceptable solutions available to Trump to quickly bring about such change. The market will instantly wake up to the reality that Trump has at best one year to enact any policy changes on or around January 20th.” – Arthur Hayes on “Trump Truth” In this context, Hayes goes further, forecasting that “this realization will lead to a vicious sell-off in crypto.” Arthur Hayes is BitMEX founder and a known crypto whale investor, usually presenting a high-time frame bullish stance. Nevertheless, Finbold reported two occasions when he publicly displayed a bullish position just to immediately dump part of his holdings. The crypto bull case for Trump’s inauguration in Q1 2025 Following Hayes’s bearish commentary, Stats (@punk9059) asked his 111,000 followers if the executive was being overly bearish . Arthur Hayes below super bearish on crypto after Trump starts. imo anticipation is the oxygen of this asset… doing things only rarely matters… so the question is more if there will be potential catalysts ahead as opposed to what trump does or doesn't do on day 1. You think… pic.twitter.com/Tupfi7jnUj — Stats (@punk9059) December 30, 2024 On that, people reminded that “Arthur was bullish at the 2021 top”, and that his “predictions often miss.” According to X commentators, Hayes “got a bunch wrong in 2024” and the current stance seems indeed “overly bearish.” In a related note, Aporia (@0xaporia) called out contrarian traders saying “everyone thinks Q1 will be bullish, so it won’t.” The analyst explained that being contrarian exposes a “lack of systemic approach” and also an “inflated ego”. Notably, Aporia shared an historical chart pattern of Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) performance in the first quarter of the year that follows the mining halving – supporting his bull case for Q1 2025 in opposition of contrarian traders that are showing a bearish bias pre-Trump’s inauguration day, like Hayes. As observed, Bitcoin has seen a massive price surge in the post-halving Q1, which could play out again in 2025. Bitcoin (BTC) historical price chart evidencing the post-halving Q1. Source: TradingView / Aporia However, it is worth noting that past performance can not guarantee future price action. Traders and investors should be able to analyze current data and reality before making important financial decisions, considering all perspectives and insights. For example, Finbold just reported an up-to-date technical analysis from Ali Martinez suggesting BTC is far from a bear market . Yet, cryptocurrencies could still briefly retrace on Trump’s inauguration day and beyond if the currently high expectations are not met. This could cause a “sell the news” event despite a potential and likely bounce up, maintaining the 2025 bull market.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Lightchain AI, priced at $0.004, is drawing investor attention, with potential for explosive growth like SHIB and SOL in 2021. Table of Contents Lightchain AI’s presale momentum mirrors early SHIB and SOL trends Technology behind Lightchain AI’s growth potential Can Lightchain AI deliver $54,000 from $540 in just 9 weeks? The cryptocurrency market is no stranger to explosive growth stories, with tokens like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Solana (SOL) achieving massive returns during their meteoric rises in 2021. Now, a new contender — Lightchain AI — is capturing the attention of investors with its presale success and potential for exponential gains. Priced at just $0.004 per token, Lightchain AI offers a unique blend of cutting-edge technology and a low entry point, sparking speculation that it could follow in the footsteps of SHIB and SOL. Lightchain AI’s presale momentum mirrors early SHIB and SOL trends Shiba Inu and Solana caught attention in 2021 for giving big profits to early backers. SHIB, a joke token, used popular marketing and group support to get huge rises, while Solana’s aim on growth and builder-friendly setup made it a top choice for apps that work without central control. Both tokens had one shared point: their skill to grab investor excitement quick in their beginnings. Lightchain AI is now copying this plan with its presale, which has already got over $7 million at a price of $0.004 for each token. First buyers are pulled to the project’s new mix of smart th͏inking and blockchain, a match that shows big chances for real life use. With more need, Lightchain AI is set to take big steps, making a chance for first-time backers to gain from its speed. Technology behind Lightchain AI’s growth potential Lightchai n AI’s growth potential is anchored in its unique integration of artificial intelligence with blockchain technology. Central to this is the Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism, which rewards nodes for executing valuable AI computations, enhancing energy efficiency and scalability. Complementing PoI is the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), a specialized environment optimized for AI workloads, enabling developers to build advanced, data-driven decentralized applications (dApps). This synergy facilitates real-time data processing, robust privacy protections, and seamless execution of AI tasks within a decentralized framework. By addressing challenges such as scalability, data privacy, and energy consumption, Lightchain AI positions itself as a transformative force in industries like healthcare, finance, and logistics, driving its substantial growth potential. Can Lightchain AI deliver $54,000 from $540 in just 9 weeks? While the crypto market is inherently unpredictable, Lightchain AI’s early-stage price and strong presale performance suggest that exponential returns are possible. A $540 investment at the current price of $0.004 could yield 135,000 tokens. If the token price rises to $0.40 within nine weeks — similar to the rapid gains seen with SHIB and SOL during their peaks — those tokens would be worth $54,000. This scenario is not without risks, as such rapid growth depends on factors like market sentiment, successful delivery of roadmap milestones, and broader crypto market conditions. However, Lightchain AI ’s unique focus and growing community support create a strong foundation for its potential rise.

Proposal for Bitcoin as a Reserve Asset Wu Jiexhuang, a member of Hong Kong’s Legislative Council, has called for the inclusion of Bitcoin in the city’s fiscal reserves. Speaking to the state-owned newspaper Wen Wei Po, Jiexhuang highlighted the potential benefits of leveraging China’s “one country, two systems” framework to adopt Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. He argued that doing so could promote financial security, boost local crypto industry development, and attract talent and investment. Jiexhuang suggested that Hong Kong could study the market impact of U.S.-based spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as part of its exploration of Bitcoin’s viability as a reserve asset. He added that such a move could also increase transaction stamp tax revenue. Global Precedents and Strategic Advantages Jiexhuang pointed to smaller nations like El Salvador and Bhutan, which have integrated Bitcoin into their strategic reserves, as examples. He also noted that certain U.S. states are pursuing similar strategies. Highlighting U.S. President Donald Trump’s recent proposal to make Bitcoin a strategic reserve asset, Jiexhuang suggested Hong Kong could gain a first-mover advantage by following suit. Jiexhuang said, “If major economic powers take the initiative to include Bitcoin in strategic reserves, the value of Bitcoin will be more stable, causing more and more other countries to follow suit and reduce their holdings of traditional assets. This will result in the fall of the price of traditional assets and will shrink the government’s fiscal reserves holding traditional assets.” Cautious Implementation Recommended While advocating for Bitcoin’s inclusion, Jiexhuang acknowledged the risks associated with the asset. He advised Hong Kong authorities to allocate only a small percentage of the national reserves to Bitcoin, initially through ETFs. Currently, Hong Kong hosts 12 ETFs tracking Bitcoin and Ethereum on its stock exchange, but their inflows remain modest compared to U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs. Existing Crypto Exposure and Broader Context The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has reportedly taken minimal exposure to cryptocurrencies as part of its investment strategy in emerging markets. Meanwhile, China holds approximately 190,000 Bitcoin, primarily acquired through confiscation efforts, ranking second globally after the United States in terms of Bitcoin reserves. This proposal is not unprecedented in Hong Kong. In July 2024, legislative council member Johnny Ng suggested a similar initiative. Both Ng and Jiexhuang believe Trump’s strategic Bitcoin reserve proposal could significantly impact traditional markets and position Hong Kong as a financial hub of crypto adoption.

Amid these concerns, an analyst has observed that Bitcoin may not be on the verge of a bear market based on historical price movements. Specifically, Ali Martinez highlighted that Bitcoin’s Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) shows the asset has yet to reach its peak in the current cycle, as he noted in a post on X on December 31. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView/Ali_charts According to the expert, Bitcoin’s market peaks coincided with the RSI surpassing the critical 92 levels in previous cycles. In 2013, the RSI breached 92 twice, signaling a major correction and the onset of a bear market. Similarly, in 2017, the RSI surpassed 92 in August and December, marking the end of Bitcoin’s bull market and the start of a bearish phase. Most recently, in 2021, the RSI exceeded 92, signaling the conclusion of the bull market and the beginning of a correction. Currently, Bitcoin’s RSI stands at 74, well below the historically significant 92 threshold. Martinez noted that while markets can be unpredictable, historical trends suggest that Bitcoin is still far from entering a bear market. Bitcoin’s bullish outlook To back his bullish outlook, Martinez observed that Bitcoin’s 12-hour chart is showing signs of potential upside momentum, with the TD Sequential indicator flashing a buy signal. In a December 31 post , he noted that if Bitcoin closes above $94,700, it could pave the way for a rally to $97,500. The TD Sequential is a technical tool that identifies potential price trend turning points. This signal comes after Bitcoin has experienced a period of consolidation around the $95,000 level. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView/Ali_charts It’s worth mentioning that several market analysts had warned that Bitcoin’s technical setup was signaling a potential crash, with the price possibly dropping as low as $18,000. For instance, as reported by Finbold, cryptocurrency analyst MFHoz noted that Bitcoin’s failure to breach the $100,000 mark indicates that the asset’s “party is over.” Interestingly, Bitcoin has failed to make significant moves despite bullish sentiment, such as MicroStrategy’s (NASDAQ: MSTR ) continued accumulation of the asset. Moreover, the market has speculated that a drop below $90,000 could trigger the start of a bear market. On December 30, Bitcoin dropped to a one-month low of $91,522 but later recovered as bullish strength reasserted itself. Bitcoin price analysis As of press time, Bitcoin was trading at $95,280, having rallied by over 2% in the last 24 hours. On the weekly chart, BTC is down about 1%. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Despite Bitcoin’s weakening strength in the short term, the asset remains largely bullish in the long run, benefiting from momentum from post-election optimism. Some market players anticipate a rally continuation beyond the $108,000 high, projecting that the asset could soar in 2025.

38347160,https://nulltx.com/?p=137352,1735654295,"Investors Ditch Ghost Chain Flops Kaspa and Fantom For PayFi ‘XLM Killer’ Set For 15,000% Rally In 2025","Investors are abandoning underperforming projects like Kaspa and Fantom, often criticized as “ghost chains,” in favor of Remittix’s revolutionary PayFi ecosystem. As the “XLM Killer,” Remittix (RTX) is introducing a blockchain-powered crypto-to-fiat solution to disrupt the cross-border payments sector. With its lightning-fast transaction speed, integrated global banking, and affordable entry cost for its RTX token, analysts expect a 15,000% rally in 2025. Early adopters could see life-changing gains. Remittix Ready To Take Cross-border Payments To The Next Level Remittix (RTX) is simplifying cross-border banking with its blockchain-powered PayFi solution. Using the PayFi app, anyone can convert cryptocurrency to fiat and deposit it in any account worldwide. Unlike standard applications like Wise and Coinbase, which restrict transactions to fiat-to-fiat or crypto-to-crypto, Remittix enables users to move cash digitally without sacrificing conventional finance. Remittix powers fast crypto-to-fiat and cross-border payments with advanced blockchain technology. Every transaction is processed through a smart contract audited by BlackSAFU, ensuring security and transparency. The protocol also utilizes local payment networks to deposit fiat into recipients’ accounts, making transactions quicker and easier than ever. Currently in its presale phase, the $RTX token is priced at just $0.0167. A $500 investment today could yield a 1200% ROI by the end of the presale. Investors also gain exclusive voting privileges in the PayFi ecosystem, allowing them to influence critical platform decisions. Alternatively, investors can stake their $RTX tokens for a fixed period to earn passive income. Remittix offers staking rewards of up to 18% APY for VIP-tier investors, providing a lucrative opportunity to grow income steadily. The limited presale supply is selling out quickly, with analysts predicting a price surge in the next presale block. With its innovative features and potential for massive gains, Remittix is poised for explosive growth. Investing could secure significant returns before $RTX prices soar in early 2025. Analysts Expect Kaspa’s Price To Grow After Accumulation Kaspa (KAS) is gaining traction as a high-performance Layer-1 blockchain. The altcoin implements a brand new blockDAG architecture for scalability and quicker transactions. Kaspa’s price increased by 2.8% to $0.11 in the last twenty-four hours. This growth is fueled by strong momentum, institutional interest, and positive chart indicators. Analyst Alex Clay recently highlighted a potential 5x breakout for Kaspa after 371 days of accumulation. He identified key price targets for traders: $0.28, $0.39 and $0.51. Chart analysis supports this outlook, showing a strong upward trendline likely to sustain Kaspa’s long-term growth. This combination of technical innovation and market optimism positions Kaspa as a promising investment in the blockchain space. Fantom’s Price Set For A Rebound Fantom (FTM) is known for creating a scalable and efficient blockchain network designed for DeFi. Fantom’s DAG consensus mechanism supports high-speed transactions with minimal fees, making it ideal for developers and businesses. Over 200 projects in DeFi, gaming, NFTs, and other sectors now operate within the Fantom ecosystem, but this is still well behind Fantom’s competitor chains in comparison. Fantom’s interoperability is strengthened by its integration with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which continues to attract developers. However, like Solana, FTM has faced challenges in the broader market. The price closed below the $1 support level at $0.98, down 30%. Given the expanding ecosystem, analysts warn of FTM’s short-term volatility but are optimistic it can rebound. Remittix To Dominate The Next Bull Run Cycle While Fantom and Kaspa offer appeal in niche industries, Remittix provides a more secure path to profitability. The RTX token is currently available at a discounted price of $0.0163. Analysts predict that Remittix could dominate the cryptocurrency market in the next bull cycle, making it a project worth monitoring closely.

38346789,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=668407,1735653622,"Crypto Trader Capitalizes On Elon Musk’s X Name Change For 17,000% Return","Elon Musk, billionaire entrepreneur and CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has once again rattled the crypto market with a simple name change on his X account. This time, Musk renamed his official profile to “Kekius Maximus” and replaced his avatar with a PEPE frog dressed in antique armor holding a gaming controller. While the eccentric tech magnate has not offered an explanation, the sudden shift has fueled intense speculation. One of the biggest beneficiaries of this development is a relatively unknown memecoin, also called Kekius Maximus (KM). Notably, mere hours before Musk’s rebranding, an anonymous trader made a noteworthy purchase that led to a massive windfall. On-chain analysis firm Lookonchain (@lookonchain) reported via X: “What a lucky trader—or perhaps an insider! 9 hours ago, he spent $4,360 to buy 18.15M KM. Just one hour ago, Elon Musk changed his profile name to Kekius Maximus, sending the price of KM soaring by ~17,000%. The 18.15M KM he bought is now worth $638K!” Related Reading: Top Crypto Assets For Q1 2025: Grayscale Reveals The Best Altcoins Whether the timing was pure coincidence or something more coordinated remains an open question. As of press time, there is no indication that Musk has any direct affiliation with the token. Yet the trader’s sensational profit underscores the often-unpredictable relationship between Musk’s online antics and sudden market movements. As of press time, Kekius Maximus (KM) is trading at $0.03087, representing a staggering 12,533% increase in the past 24 hours. Its market capitalization has shot up to $30.87 million, while daily trading volume has surged to approximately $103.51 million. However, contrary to claims from some crypto media outlets, Musk’s name change has no connection to the memecoin itself, and there is no affiliation. Once again, it’s a fortunate surprise for certain crypto traders. Related Reading: Expert Reveals Top 15 Crypto Predictions For 2025 You Need To Know Remarkably, this is not the first time Musk has generated a frenzy with his name or profile changes. In the past, he has adopted monikers like Mr Tweet, Naughty Moniker, and Naughtius Maximus. In April 2023, he famously replaced the Twitter bird logo with the Dogecoin Shiba Inu dog, causing a temporary DOGE price spike. Regarding his latest adoption of the term “Kekius Maximus,” various interpretations abound within online communities. “Kek” traces its origins to World of Warcraft’s auto-translation of “LOL,” evolving into a broader internet meme. “Pepe the Frog” is similarly intertwined with “Kek,” having been adopted by assorted online subcultures over the years. The notion of “Kekistan”—a fictional internet “nation” that plays on cultural satire as a satirical response to identity politics, while the flag of Kekistan mimics a German war flag. Recently, Musk has made significant waves in German politics by expressing support for the Alternative for Germany (AFD).

On the other hand, Cardano (ADA) continues to show bullish momentum, and targets mention reaching another all-time high. The new contender Yeti Ouro (YETIO), keeps garnering attention with its presale gaining momentum. Investors are seen rushing to presale due to YETIO offering a 25% bonus on all purchases made between December 31 and January 2. Yeti Ouro: The Altcoin Revolutionizing Play-to-Earn Gaming Yeti Ouro is quickly becoming a standout project in the crypto landscape, blending gaming innovation with token utility. Yeti Ouro combines the meme coin craze with serious utility, delivering actual value to holders with a meme coin built on the Ethereum blockchain. Central to this project is its highly-anticipated Play-to-Earn (P2E) racing game, Yeti Go. Yeti Go – The P2E Game That Offers Real Rewards Yeti Go is more than just a racing game; it’s an adrenalized PvP where players race against each other, using skills and tactics to outsmart their opponents. Yeti Go is built with Unreal Engine for state-of-the-art graphics and FMOD for extraordinary audio. Here, players are rewarded with YETIO tokens when winning races or other challenges and by staking tokens for in-game advantages. Tokens can also be spent to buy exclusive upgrades, trade collectibles on the marketplace, or enter high-stakes tournaments. Yeti Ouro relies on its community-driven model to build a flourishing environment for gamers and investors. Yeti Ouro’s presale has also about really moved up with big injections going in. A capped total supply of 1 billion YETIO creates scarcity and greater demand as more investors familiarise themselves with YETI’s fundamental proposition. Featured with a large community and continuous development updates, Yeti Ouro has all it takes to be a top competitor in the crypto market. XRP Price Prediction: Legal Troubles Continue To Hurt Price XRP from Ripple is still facing pressure from ongoing legal woes with the SEC. The case addresses one of the core questions of the entire cryptocurrency market: whether XRP is a security. Although all is not lost for XRP price, which has seen recent rebounds and relishes some solace, the case’s outcome is crucial to its future trajectory. 1-month XRP price chart- source: CoinMarketCap XRP News: Speculations And Its Impacts On The Market Due To SEC The open-ended legal dispute has made XRP extremely speculative. In any case, XRP has a die-hard community, and the right news in the case could cause triple-figure price moves. Still, the uncertainty is leading many to avoid traditional, high-potential altcoins and keep the focus on Yeti Ouro. This new project has no regulatory baggage and the potential for explosive growth. Cardano Price Prediction: On The Verge Of An All-Time High Even as it was subjected to market neglect, Cardano (ADA) has proven to be one of the most solid blockchains in the crypto realm. As a result of its sustainability and scalability, Cardano adoption rate has increased for dApps & DeFi ecosystems. 1-month ADA price chart- source: CoinMarketCap Cardano News: Bullish Momentum For ADA The strong technical foundation of Cardano attained and recent series of network upgrades have established a ground for potential all-time high. As more projects launch on the Cardano blockchain, demand for ADA is expected to increase, which will drive ADA price higher, analysts say. Yet, ADA provides stability and growth, whereas it finds no competitive edge with the entertainment-driven appeal and practicality that Yeti Ouro can offer through its P2E ecosystem. Conclusion With Ripple facing legal ambiguity and Cardano swelling to new heights, Yeti Ouro offers a convergence of gaming, investment, and digital currency like no other. Offering innovative P2E mechanics, immersive gameplay, and token-based rewards, the Yeti Go game cements Yeti Ouro as a project that both entertains and rewards its community beyond the game itself. From the crypto investors scouting for the next big thing Yeti Ouro is one to watch. To celebrate the New Year, Yeti Ouro is offering investors a 25% bonus on purchases made between December 31 and January 2. This initiative highlights Yeti Ouro’s commitment to welcoming 2025 with exciting opportunities and valuable rewards for its community.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Altcoin surge ignites market buzz; discover which coins could be key to maximizing this rally’s potential gains. Table of Contents XYZ could be the ultimate meme coin for the rally Ethereum Cardano XRP Dogecoin Conclusion The altcoin market is experiencing a significant surge. Certain coins are outperforming others, capturing attention as their values climb. This upward trend raises the question: which coins could be crucial during this rally? Delving into the current market dynamics, this article highlights the altcoins that might be essential additions for those looking to capitalize on the momentum. You might also like: Don’t miss these winter altcoins: XYZVerse tops the list with promising returns XYZ could be the ultimate meme coin for the rally XYZ is the sports-driven meme coin that’s taking the crypto world by storm. As values climb across the board, XYZ is poised to deliver explosive returns, making it a must-watch for anyone looking to capitalize on the momentum. Blending the excitement of sports betting with the viral power of meme culture, XYZ is at the heart of XYZVerse, an award-winning ecosystem designed for both crypto enthusiasts and sports fans. Think back to Polymarket’s $1 billion trading frenzy during the U.S. elections. Now imagine that energy amplified in the world of meme coins, where millions of sports bettors and crypto degens are gearing up to dive into the action. With a presale strategy projecting a staggering 7,400% growth and major exchange listings on the horizon, XYZ is severely undervalued at its current price. Early investors have a chance to secure life-changing gains before this token claims its spot as the MVP of the altcoin rally. As the market heats up, XYZ is more than just a meme coin; it’s a high-potential contender in the next wave of crypto champions. Ethereum Ethereum is more than just digital money. It’s a platform that changed how we use blockchain technology. Created by Vitalik Buterin in 2015, Ethereum introduced smart contracts and decentralized apps. This means people can build applications that run exactly as programmed, without any chance of fraud or third-party interference. In 2022, Ethereum made a big move called the Merge, shifting to a Proof-of-Stake system. This change made transactions faster and more energy-efficient. Soon, Ethereum plans to add sharding, a feature that will make it even quicker and reduce costs. Right now, Ethereum looks promising in the crypto world. While some coins simply serve as digital cash, Ethereum offers a whole ecosystem for new ideas. Its network supports decentralized finance, games, and more. With upgrades on the horizon, Ethereum aims to handle more transactions at lower fees. Compared to other coins, its strong foundation and active development make it stand out. Market trends show a growing interest in platforms that do more than just store value. Ethereum’s commitment to innovation keeps it at the forefront, making it an attractive option in the current market. Cardano Cardano is making waves in the cryptocurrency world. It’s a blockchain platform that’s flexible, sustainable, and scalable. Designed for smart contracts, it helps developers create decentralized finance apps, crypto tokens, and games. Its native coin, ADA, is a rival to Ethereum’s ETH. Users can store value, make payments, and even stake ADA on the Cardano network. What sets Cardano apart is its eco-friendly approach. Instead of using energy-hungry methods like Bitcoin, it uses a proof-of-stake system called Ouroboros. This means it’s much more energy-efficient. But that’s not all. Cardano’s blockchain is split into two layers. One handles transactions, and the other deals with smart contracts. This design boosts its ability to process transactions, potentially up to a million per second. With the introduction of native tokens in March 2021, interacting with smart contracts became more secure and cheaper. This makes Cardano a strong contender in the crypto market. In the current market cycle, where scalability and sustainability are key, ADA looks attractive. Compared to other coins, its technology offers efficiency and room for growth. As the demand for decentralized apps grows, Cardano’s unique features could help it rise to the top. XRP Imagine sending money anywhere in the world in just seconds, with minimal fees and without needing a bank account. That’s the promise of XRP, a digital currency built on the XRP Ledger. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP was designed to be fast, low-cost, and accessible to everyone. With no central authority controlling it, transactions are secure and can’t be reversed, making it a reliable option for global transfers. Ripple, the company supporting XRP, holds a large reserve to ensure stability and growth, aiming to make payments as seamless as sending a text message. In today’s market, XRP stands out for its speed and efficiency compared to other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. While Bitcoin transactions can take minutes or even hours, XRP transactions settle in mere seconds. This makes it attractive for people and businesses looking to move money quickly across borders. As the world moves towards digital payments, XRP’s technology positions it well for growth. Although the crypto market is known for volatility, XRP’s focus on real-world utility could make it a promising option in the current cycle, especially as more institutions look for fast and cost-effective payment solutions. Dogecoin Dogecoin started in 2013 as a joke. It featured a Shiba Inu dog from a popular meme as its logo. Created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, it was meant to be a fun alternative to other cryptocurrencies. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a limited supply, Dogecoin is abundant. There’s no maximum limit, and 10,000 new coins are mined every minute. People first saw it as a “meme coin,” but in 2021, its value soared. It became one of the top ten cryptocurrencies by market value, exceeding $50 billion. Social media buzz and support from Elon Musk helped drive its rise. This shows how strong communities and social media can impact financial markets. Dogecoin’s technology is simple and based on earlier cryptocurrencies. Its abundance means transactions are fast and fees are low. In the current market, some see Dogecoin as an appealing option. Its popularity and strong community support keep it in the spotlight. Compared to other coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum, Dogecoin is more accessible. Market trends show continued interest in cryptocurrencies. As more people enter the market, coins like Dogecoin may continue to gain attention. However, its price can be very volatile. It’s important to stay informed and understand the risks before getting involved. Conclusion While ETH, ADA, XRP, and DOGE are strong, XYZVerse is unique, uniting sports fans in a meme coin aiming for significant growth and community-driven success.

US San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly compared cryptocurrencies to gold in an interview with Yahoo Finance. Stating that cryptocurrencies and gold are not the same, Daly emphasized that cryptocurrencies should not be seen in the same class as gold and should be classified as a separate asset class. Daly added that cryptocurrencies have a multifaceted structure and that a clear definition is needed. “I see cryptocurrencies as a complex thing and the service we need to provide to everyone is to clearly define what they are. Cryptocurrencies can be a medium of exchange. It can be a stock (an asset that retains its value or sometimes loses value.) “That's why I don't think cryptocurrencies are like gold. Sometimes they have properties like gold, but I think they have fundamentally different properties than gold.” Daly noted that he agreed with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s views that cryptocurrencies do not yet have the status of a currency. However, Daly added that for cryptocurrencies to achieve such status, their value must be aligned with economic growth. Daly’s perspective contrasts with that of Powell, who described Bitcoin at the New York Times DealBook conference as a speculative, highly volatile digital asset more akin to gold than the dollar, and noted its limited use as a payment method or stable store of value. *This is not investment advice.

38346901,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=635317,1735653484,Terra’s Do Kwon finally extradited to the United States. What’s next?,"Do Kwon, the controversial co-founder of Terraform Labs, is officially on U.S. soil. After months of legal battles and international drama, Montenegro handed Kwon over to U.S. authorities on December 31. Known for orchestrating one of the biggest disasters in crypto history, Kwon now faces the fallout from the $40 billion implosion of TerraUSD (UST) and its sister token, Luna. This collapse not only decimated investor funds but also crashed the global crypto market. Montenegro’s Prime Minister, Milojko Spajic, confirmed the extradition in a post on X, calling it a testament to the country’s commitment to international justice. Kwon was arrested in Montenegro last year while trying to board a flight to Dubai with a fake passport. And that was the end of his ludicrous, and frankly quite dramatic, year-long run from authorities. The implosion that rocked crypto Terraform Labs launched TerraUSD as an algorithmic stablecoin designed to maintain a 1:1 peg to the U.S. dollar. Investors flocked to it, pouring billions into the project, lured by Kwon’s confident pitch and the promise of a revolutionary crypto product. But in May 2022, UST lost its peg and Luna lost over 90% of its value in what was one of the largest financial collapses in history. Investors lost $40 billion overnight. Hedge funds collapsed. High-profile firms like Three Arrows Capital and BlockFi filed for bankruptcy. Authorities wasted no time going after Kwon. South Korea issued a warrant for his arrest, but by then, he was on the run. Facing the music Now back in the U.S., Kwon is staring down eight criminal charges, including securities fraud, commodities fraud, wire fraud, and conspiracy to defraud investors. Prosecutors allege that he knowingly misled investors about TerraUSD’s stability and how Terraform even worked. They accuse him of inflating the system’s value while hiding its vulnerabilities. If convicted, Kwon could spend more than 100 years in prison. His situation isn’t much better in South Korea, where he’s facing a separate legal battle. Authorities there say if they get their hands on him, he would face up to 40 years behind bars for financial crimes related to the TerraUSD meltdown. In April this year, a U.S. court found Terraform Labs and Kwon personally liable for fraud in a civil case brought by the SEC . The court ruled that Terraform’s crypto products were securities and that Kwon’s team misled investors. The company agreed to pay $4.5 billion to settle the case. This included $3.58 billion in disgorgement, $466 million in prejudgment interest, and $420 million in civil penalties. Kwon himself was slapped with a $110 million penalty. His personal fortune was once thought to be hundreds of millions of dollars. However, it has since been drained by lawsuits, fines, and legal fees.

38346481,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=376715,1735652972,Bitcoin Mining Faces Rising Costs as Hashprice Boosts Provide Only Temporary Relief,"The mining difficulty of Bitcoin hit a new peak of 109.78 trillion, climbing 1.16% in Sunday’s latest adjustment. This represents a 24% increase over the past 90 days and a 52% rise during the last three months of the year. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s hash rate also crossed the 800 EH/s threshold this month for the first time, signaling the network’s solid performance. Despite these indicators of a strong network, miners face challenges due to the halved block rewards and increased difficulty, which squeeze their profitability. Temporary Relief But Cost Pressures Mount for Bitcoin Miners CoinShares’ Q3 Bitcoin Mining Report highlights that although these factors have raised mining costs, the recent rise in hashprice has provided temporary relief. However, this boost is not expected to last, and miners will need to adapt to the long-term pressures driven by rising costs and competition for resources. In its latest report, the European asset manager stated that cost-of-production pressures are expected to continue and will be driven by fierce competition for land and power resources. Hyperscalers, which offer more profitable alternatives, are outbidding miners and are ultimately driving up operational costs. Meanwhile, machine prices, closely correlated with Bitcoin’s value, are also set to increase thereby amplifying capital expenditures and depreciation expenses. Miners Explore AI and Clean Energy Solutions As a result, miners are adopting diverse strategies such as HODLing Bitcoin or exploring artificial intelligence (AI) partnerships, which may temporarily slow BTC production but open new revenue streams. CoinShares’s identified firms, like TeraWulf and Cipher, are well-positioned to capitalize on AI opportunities due to their strategic relationships with energy companies and significant investments in clean energy. However, the financial impact of these ventures may take time to materialize, the report stated. On the other hand, debt markets remain liquid and encourage miners to issue new debt even as rising interest expenses and risks of insolvency loom large. Public miners like Argo face heightened risks, particularly if Bitcoin prices dip. This is due to negative shareholder equity and limited fundraising options. Notably, the average cash cost of mining Bitcoin rose to almost $55,950 in Q3, a 13% increase from Q2, with total costs, including non-cash expenses, climbing to roughly $106,000. Companies like TeraWulf have emerged as low-cost leaders, aided by reduced debt expenses, while others, like Riot and Marathon, achieved quarter-over-quarter production growth.

38346580,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=635419,1735652954,AI agents emerge as the top narrative in 2024 as L2s endure a down year,"The balance of narratives shifted at the end of 2024, putting the AI agent theme above all others for short-term earnings. AI surpassed even meme tokens as the most actively appreciating token class. The AI narrative achieved the highest returns of 2024, based on a year-end data collection by CoinGecko. AI-themed tokens achieved average returns of 2,940% for the past 12 months, even surpassing the net achievements of meme tokens. The real AI rally happened from the end of November onward, even though the sector grew by only 77% until the end of Q3. Virtuals Protocol led the AI agent rally The AI narrative started expanding in the last three months of the year, rising mostly due to the influence of AI agent tokens. Previously, the AI narrative included older projects, such as FET and RNDR, which only had minor rallies. The last months of 2024 tapped the growth from both individual AI agents and the emergence of launch platforms. One of the biggest drivers of growth in December turned out to be Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL). The token traded at an all-time high of $3.79 , gaining more than 300% in the past weeks. Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL) kept posting rapid gains in December, reaching a new all-time high at $3.79. | Source: CoinGecko Some of the recently launched AI agent tokens had the characteristics of meme tokens, hence their immediate price appreciation. GOAT and FARTCOIN were in fact launched as memes, while also riding the AI narrative. In just a few days, the AI token collection expanded its total market capitalization from around $8.7B to over $13B , with no signs of stopping. Since most AI agents are relatively new, they lack the influence of meme tokens, which still grew by 2,185% on average. As an adjacent narrative, DePIN tokens rose by 135% in 2024. DePIN was actually the category to take up former AI tokens that also built infrastructure and shared GPU pools. DePIN may benefit from the market for AI agents, which will also need GPU power to produce content. L2 was the only losing narrative The worst performer in 2024 was the L2 narrative, despite the increased usage of actual L2 platforms. Both new launches and the existing tokens in this narrative underperformed. One reason is the legacy of token unlocks, which put downward pressure on the price. The other was an attempt to raise funds for launching new L2s, even when there was no need to create an additional chain. L2 was the only losing narrative in 2024, with an average loss of 20.7%. Another reason for the struggle is the additional scrutiny on the performance of L2s. Once their airdrop mining periods passes, previously busy chains see an immediate outflow of traffic. Even speed and innovation were not enough to convince investors. Previous stars like Scroll were among the biggest losers for the past year. The entire L2 sector ends the year at a total market capitalization of $29B, with most tokens in the red for the past week. Most of the L2 activity in 2024 concentrated on a handful of leading networks, including Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, Taiko, Linea, ZKSync, Starknet, and Blast. All of those chains shift positions depending on the activity of their apps. Arbitrum retains its leading position by attracting liquidity from Ethereum and hosting top DEX apps. Older Web3 narratives underperform Web3 is no longer enjoying the same level of hype, as most of the features work in the background and are integrated into newer tokens. DeFi tokens gained on average 101% in 2024, joined by growth in RWA projects by 820%. Layer 1 chains, led by SUI and Aptos, rallied by 142% in the past year. The weakest gains came from GameFi, which underperformed the market, growing just 15% on average. In the past year, the Web3 gaming and NFT narratives also underperformed, despite the occasional rally for top collections. The only return to NFT happened ahead of the Pudgy Penguins PENGU airdrop. NFT failed to have a year-end rally, despite the Magic Eden (ME) airdrop. The OpenSea platform also faced delays in launching its new version, while attention shifted to the other active narratives.

Here’s 3 Reasons Why!,"As the cryptocurrency market evolves, Bitcoin (BTC) and gold have traditionally been the go-to options for investors seeking security and value. However, Lightchain AI (LCAI) is quickly stealing the spotlight, offering a compelling alternative with its $0.0045 presale price and over $6.28 million raised. With its innovative technology and ambitious roadmap, Lightchain AI is proving to be more than just a speculative bet—it’s a future-focused platform poised to deliver significant value. Unmatched Early-Stage Potential in a Growing Market While Bitcoin and gold are established assets, they lack the explosive growth potential that Lightchain AI offers during its early stages. At its presale price of $0.0045, LCAI allows investors to enter at the ground floor of a project that combines cutting-edge blockchain technology with artificial intelligence. This unique positioning enables investors to capitalize on exponential growth opportunities that mature assets like Bitcoin and gold can no longer deliver. Additionally, Lightchain AI’s success in raising over $6.28 million during its presale phase is a testament to its strong investor confidence. By targeting industry-specific use cases and providing decentralized solutions, Lightchain AI demonstrates its ability to scale and adapt in ways traditional assets cannot. Real-World Applications Beyond Wealth Preservation Bitcoin has established itself as a store of value, and gold remains a classic hedge against economic uncertainty. However, neither of these assets directly addresses modern challenges across industries. Lightchain AI bridges this gap by focusing on real-world applications in sectors like healthcare, finance, and supply chain management. By offering solutions such as decentralized governance frameworks and privacy-preserving technology, Lightchain AI ensures its platform remains relevant to both businesses and individuals. This practical utility sets it apart from Bitcoin’s limited transactional use and gold’s static nature, making Lightchain AI a more versatile investment for the future. Community-Driven Innovation and Deflationary Tokenomics Lightchain AI’s innovative tokenomics and community-driven governance structure are key factors drawing investors away from traditional assets. Its deflationary model, which includes periodic token burns, creates a sustainable ecosystem that balances supply and demand. This design ensures that the value of LCAI tokens grows alongside the platform’s adoption. Moreover, Lightchain AI empowers its community by allowing token holders to participate in governance decisions. Unlike Bitcoin, which relies on miner consensus, or gold, which lacks any participatory framework, Lightchain AI ensures that its future is shaped collectively.

38346373,https://crypto.news/?p=14323630,1735652753,"Dogecoin, Solana eye fresh highs in q1 2025 but this new altcoin could steal the show","Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Crypto giants Dogecoin and Solana eye Q1 2025 highs, but Rollblock may lead with a breakout rally. Table of Contents Rollblock poised for groundbreaking gains Solana eyes $300 in January Can Dogecoin actually overtake Solana? Conclusion The recent crypto market correction has shaken things up, but it also sets the stage for a potential explosive rally in the coming months. Crypto bigwigs like Dogecoin and Solana are expected to boom, with some quarters of the market predicting DOGE would overtake SOL soon. However, the project that’s generating significant buzz is Rollblock . While the crypto world debates whether Dogecoin can surpass Solana in market capitalization, Rollblock is quietly laying the groundwork for a festive breakout. You might also like: Shiba Inu, Dogecoin struggle while Rollblock is targeting 10x gains in Q1 2025 Rollblock poised for groundbreaking gains Rollblock is an online crypto casino that is designed to change the GambleFi market. It champions transparency and user empowerment, making it a provably fair gaming platform, which is rare in this space. Then there are the fast withdrawals, bonuses, rakebacks, exquisite games, and other gaming incentives that make it the go-to place for most people. For crypto investors, Rollblock offers staking rewards and a share of the revenue it generates every week. This has been its backbone since its launch, as it not only rewards loyal players but also fosters a strong and vibrant community. At the moment, Rollblock is home to thousands of active players, and tens of thousands of investors have contributed to its roaring presale. Available now for $0.044 per token , it has raised close to $8 million from the public. This crypto is billed to appreciate by 800% before the presale ends, which is why its explosion during this festive period is pretty possible. Solana eyes $300 in January Solana is a high-performance blockchain whose growing ecosystem has it competing with Ethereum. Buoyed by a massive community and positive Solana news, SOL hit an all-time high of $263 recently. However, some of these gains were wiped out in the last market liquidation, sending SOL down to the $200 price level. This drop has reduced the gap between SOL and coins like DOGE, sparking rumors the latter could overtake it. Nevertheless, SOL remains a crypto bigwig and is eyeing a resurgence to $300 in the new year. Can Dogecoin actually overtake Solana? Dogecoin has a bigger fan base than Solana even though it has little to no utility or use case. Its rally in the last month has pushed DOGE’s market cap to around $47 billion, which is quite massive. However, Solana’s market cap is around $90 billion, almost double what the meme coin currently boasts of. It would be quite difficult for Dogecoin to overtake Solana during this festive season. The only way that could happen is if DOGE goes on a ballistic rally while Solana drops drastically. The chances of this happening are rare, but it doesn’t mean that the king of meme coins won’t fetch a decent profit in the coming months. Conclusion Given that Solana news is mostly positive, SOL is less likely to depreciate more than it already has, making it difficult for Dogecoin to overtake it. That is why the savvy investors are going in for Rollblock. Priced at an attractive $0.044, it is set to appreciate stellarly during the festive periods before its presale concludes. When it hits the exchanges, Rollblock may fetch investors major profits in excess of 10,000%. This is due to its capability to disrupt the $500 billion GambleFi market. It’s the reason why everyone is hopping onto the Rollblock presale. For more information, visit the Rollblock presale website and join the online community.

The firm forecasts a global shift toward recognizing BTC as a digital store of value, driven by growing institutional and sovereign adoption. BTC as a Strategic Reserve Asset Released on December 30, Franklin Templeton’s predictions highlight a pivotal transition for Bitcoin from speculative investment to functional utility. The company believes Bitcoin’s integration into national reserves will accelerate as its foundational technologies become increasingly intertwined with global financial systems. While the ETF issuer did not identify specific nations poised for adoption, it emphasized crypto’s potential to solidify its position as a global asset. Recent developments underscore this trend. Wu Jiexhuang, a member of Hong Kong’s Legislative Council, proposed incorporating Bitcoin into the city’s national reserves, citing the examples of El Salvador and Bhutan. Jiexhuang argued that BTC could bolster financial stability and noted the major impact of the United States’ approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January, which spurred institutional adoption. Additionally, President-elect Donald Trump’s suggestion to designate Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset for the U.S. could further influence global markets. Germany Eyes Bitcoin for Monetary Stability Germany is also emerging as a potential advocate for Bitcoin adoption. The Free Democratic Party (FDP), which is gearing up for the 2025 elections, has expressed openness to integrating BTC into national reserves. The party’s platform emphasizes the use of distributed ledger technology to enhance the European monetary system’s resilience. Christian Lindner, the former finance minister and FDP leader, criticized the German government for failing to embrace the opportunities offered by BTC and other crypto innovations. Lindner described the absence of a crypto-friendly policy as a missed chance for economic growth and innovation, urging Germany to adopt strategies that leverage Bitcoin’s advantages. As Bitcoin’s role in global financial systems evolves, the prospect of national Bitcoin reserves marks a critical development.

Bold Prediction Sparks Heated Responses from XRP Army,"A tweet by crypto influencer Amonyx has stirred significant conversation within the cryptocurrency community. The post , which included a chart highlighting XRP’s potential price trajectory from $3.30 to an ambitious $180, sparked polarized opinions among enthusiasts and skeptics alike. Accompanied by the caption, “Are U mentally prepared? #XRP,” the projection reignited discussions about the feasibility of such a target. Are U mentally prepared? #XRP pic.twitter.com/EiPWoMPkrT — Amonyx (@amonbuy) December 29, 2024 Analyzing the Chart The chart shared by Amonyx outlines a steep, upward trajectory for XRP, predicting a potential rise to $180. This projection implies a substantial rally far beyond its previous all-time high of $3.30, achieved during the 2017-2018 bull market. At the time of press, XRP trades at $2.09, having experienced a 2.55% decline over the past 24 hours. While the bullish forecast excites proponents, it has also drawn criticism from those who see it as overly optimistic. XRP Community’s Reactions Responses to Amonyx’s post reflect the mixed sentiment surrounding XRP’s potential. While some users expressed enthusiasm for the ambitious target, others provided more skeptical and pragmatic takes. One commenter emphasized the improbability of XRP surpassing Bitcoin’s market capitalization by a factor of 10, which would be necessary to reach $180 under current market conditions. Another participant stressed the need for the crypto community to focus on credibility, urging influencers to avoid excessive hype that may detract from the industry’s legitimacy. They argued that speculative posts could hinder adoption by the professional financial sector, which increasingly views blockchain technology as a transformative force. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Challenges to XRP’s Market Outlook For XRP to attain such a significant height, several factors must align. These include widespread adoption of its use case as a bridge currency for cross-border payments, regulatory clarity, and substantial increases in market liquidity and capitalization. XRP would need to dominate its niche market and attract significant institutional interest. Currently, XRP operates under a legal and regulatory cloud in certain jurisdictions, such as the United States, where its classification as a security remains contested. Although XRP’s utility as a fast and cost-effective payment solution is recognized, these hurdles challenge its broader adoption and price growth. While ambitious price predictions generate excitement, they also underscore the importance of balanced discussions within the crypto community. It is crucial to evaluate such forecasts critically, considering market dynamics, adoption trends, and historical performance.

Among the trending shifts is the migration of PEPE holders to presale tokens offering innovative features and game-changing announcements. While PEPE has been a staple in the meme coin sector, investors are now diversifying into promising projects that combine cutting-edge technology with real-world applications. Tokens like Lightchain AI (LCAI) are stealing the spotlight with their presale success and ambitious roadmaps, signaling a shift in investor sentiment toward utility-driven assets. PEPE’s Popularity Slows as Investors Seek Growth Potential PEPE has been a dominant force in the meme coin market, fueled by community support and viral appeal. Its lighthearted branding and accessibility have made it a favorite among retail investors looking for quick gains. However, as the crypto market matures, the focus is shifting from speculative hype to tokens with tangible utility and innovation. Despite its strong presence, PEPE’s growth has started to plateau, with limited opportunities for long-term scalability or real-world application. This stagnation has prompted many PEPE holders to explore newer tokens in their presale stages, which offer greater upside potential and align with evolving market trends. Presale Tokens Like Lightchain AI Lead the Charge Among the presale tokens gaining traction, Lightchain AI (LCAI) stands out as a leader. Combining artificial intelligence with blockchain technology, Lightchain AI is redefining the possibilities of decentralized applications. Currently priced at $0.0045 in Stage 10, LCAI has already raised over $6.28 million, reflecting widespread investor confidence. With announcements of partnerships and a roadmap focusing on real-world applications, Lightchain AI is capturing the attention of both PEPE holders and institutional investors. The platform’s unique features, such as privacy-preserving AI computations and scalable solutions, set it apart from traditional blockchain projects, making it a top contender for exponential growth. Big Announcements Drive Investor Interest What’s driving the presale frenzy? Tokens like Lightchain AI are leveraging strategic announcements and innovative roadmaps to draw in early adopters. Key announcements include new partnerships with industry leaders in healthcare, finance, and logistics, showcasing the token’s real-world utility. Additionally, developer incentives are being introduced to foster a strong developer community, ensuring long-term ecosystem growth and sustainability. Lightchain AI is also focused on scalability innovations, with advanced infrastructure designed to handle large-scale AI computations, making it an attractive option for enterprises and developers seeking efficient solutions. These developments highlight a clear commitment to innovation, positioning Lightchain AI as a high-potential investment for 2023 and beyond. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Bitcoin fails to restore $98,000 while Ethereum may close the trade below $3,500. Meanwhile, the XRP price continues to trade above $2, displaying magnificent strength that may result in the token manifesting massive moves in the upcoming days in 2025. The current trade setup for XRP suggests the token is poised to mark a double-digit figure in 2025, as the bulls appear to be poised for a 10x rally. The XRP price is displaying very sluggish behaviour at the moment, with the volume depleting and reaching the lowest possible levels. This may suggest a massive drop in the number of buyers, as the progress seems to be very low. However, the token is about to make a historic yearly close above $2 after marking a seven-year high close to $3. Hence, sealing the levels above $2 that it usually fails to achieve after the 2018 & 2021 bull run suggests there is more room for the token to thrive in 2025.

The recent rise in the trading volume that surpassed $55 billion indicates the bulls are vigilant over the token.

However, USDT balances increased by 1.91 billion to 8.56 billion, representing a 28.79% monthly gain.

Ethereum assets increased by 85,265 ETH to reach 1.765 million ETH, with the exchange maintaining a 102% reserve ratio. This means OKX holds 1.807 million ETH in wallet assets, divided between 1.630 million ETH on the exchange and 176,527 ETH in third-party custody.

For major cryptocurrencies, the reserve ratios paint a clear picture of the exchange’s risk management: Bitcoin at 105%, Ethereum at 102%, and Solana at 103%.

38387132,https://coinpedia.org/?p=400502,1735652285,Pepe (PEPE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) Struggle to Maintain Gains While This New Altcoin Attracts Massive Interest,"The post Pepe (PEPE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) Struggle to Maintain Gains While This New Altcoin Attracts Massive Interest appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News A new altcoin is silently becoming popular among meme coin investors as Pepe (PEPE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) struggle with recent bearish trends. While these top tokens encounter opposition and uncertainty, Lunex Network (LNEX) is attracting interest with its innovative DeFi trading method. Providing lightning-fast transactions, complete anonymity, and flawless interoperability across 40+ blockchains, Lunex Network is transforming DeFi trading. But why are investors swarming to Lunex Network massively this month? Read on to discover how Lunex Network is laying the groundwork for exponential rallies and the reasons analysts are very bullish on LNEX. Lunex Network (LNEX) Is Enhancing DeFi Trading By providing a flawless, anonymous, and lightning-fast experience over more than 50,000 cryptocurrencies spanning over 40 blockchains, Lunex Network is enhancing DeFi trading. Unlike traditional DEXs that call for third-party wallet integrations like MetaMask or Trust Wallet, Lunex Network guarantees total user control while preserving security and privacy. Lunex Network lets users trade completely under anonymity, therefore lowering vulnerabilities and simplifying transactions with minimum fees. Its developer-friendly ecosystem speeds up blockchain innovation by giving quick access to over 65 RPC nodes and an easily obtained API key, therefore simplifying Web3 development. Priced at just $0.0048, the LNEX token offers investors a great prospect during its presale period. Early investors who bought at $0.0012 have already seen an amazing 300% return; analysts estimate a possible 500% gain even before the presale ends. The Lunex Pro membership of the platform provides even more value by providing advanced tools including cashback on every transaction and AML wallet address checks for increased fund security. Pepe (PEPE) Struggles With Bearish Trends The Pepe price dropped significantly, by more than 21% , over the past week. The Pepe price chart clearly displays a sequence of lower highs and lower lows, hitting a low of $0.000015 before entering a consolidation period between $0.000016 and $0.000019. This therefore indicates a bearish trend for the Pepe price. The performance of the Pepe coin was bearish over the past month as well, as it dropped 12%. Notwithstanding these challenges, the community sentiment is still very positive since investors anticipate the Pepe coin will break out from the current consolidation soon. Showing indications of a possible rebound, a surge in positive momentum sent the price of Pepe (PEPE) back toward the $0.000020 resistance following touching the $0.000015 support. Looking ahead, Pepe’s (PEPE) future seems bright. Though the meme coin is still over 35% away from its ATH of $0.000028 reached on December 9, some analysts believe Pepe (PEPE) might set a new ATH as early as the first week of 2025. While the Momentum Oscillator warns traders of a sell momentum, the Moving Averages show buy signals on the Pepe price chart. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Faces Bearish Pressure The Shiba Inu price has had a negative run after decli2qning 17% over the past week and similarly during the past month. Once briefly crossing the $0.000033 barrier, the Shiba Inu price battled to break over the immediate resistance. The bears grabbed control accordingly, pushing the price below the $0.000020 support zone as the Shiba Inu price chart shows. Reflecting a period of uncertainty, Shiba Inu (SHIB) ranges right now between $0.000023 and $0.000021. Though recovery is still conceivable, traders are concerned about the near-term outlook of the meme currency as the monthly Shiba Inu price chart indicates the altcoin breaching a bullish trendline . Buy indications shown by the MACD and Moving Averages imply that the present negative phase might be transient. Still showing some negative signals , though, the Momentum Oscillator and CCI suggest Shiba Inu (SHIB) is not quite out of bearish control. However, experts remain hopeful that Shiba Inu (SHIB) could recover from recent losses in a few weeks. Lunex Network Attracts Pepe and Shiba Inu Investors As Pepe (PEPE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) negotiate bearish tendencies, Lunex Network (LNEX) is positioned as the preferred platform for the next wave of crypto investors with unparalleled privacy, lightning-fast transactions, and flawless interoperability across 40+ blockchains. Lunex Network is rapidly becoming the ideal choice for investors wishing to diversify and expand their portfolios because of its special qualities, which include zero requirements for third-party wallet integrations and the promise of huge gains.

The vulnerability was discovered after discussions on Reddit highlighted the risks to users’ funds. Redditors criticized Tangem for exposing the private keys to email accounts and making them accessible to its employees. Tangem’s Wallet Vulnerability: What Happened? On Dec. 29, a Reddit user, u/areklanga, raised the alarm , claiming Tangem had failed to address the issue promptly. They alleged that private keys were stored in email histories and possibly in Tangem’s internal systems. The user further noted that an earlier Reddit post pointing out the problem was mysteriously deleted. Tangem acknowledged the flaw on Dec. 30 and released a bug fix to address the issue. HOLY CRAP TANGEM WALLET JUST LEAKED SEED PHRASES. Someone called them out on Reddit and Tangem had to figure it out. pic.twitter.com/zA5OqRGb0h — Lysander (@UnderCoercion) December 31, 2024 In a statement addressing the issue, Tangem assured its users that the problem had been fully resolved. The company said , “We sincerely appreciate your feedback regarding this issue and want to assure you that it has been fully resolved, At Tangem, we prioritize transparency, security, and trust, and we take matters like these extremely seriously.” According to Tangem, the vulnerability stemmed from a bug in the app’s log processing system. This flaw affected a limited group of users who created wallets using seed phrases and contacted the support team directly through the app. These logs, which included private keys, were accessible for a short period before being deleted. The company clarified that users who activated their wallets without seed phrases were unaffected, as their private keys are generated directly on Tangem’s hardware cards. The company explained: “Private keys do not exist with such setups, therefore they are unable to be extracted by anyone, not even Tangem.” While the overall impact was minimal, affecting fewer than 0.1% of users, Tangem acknowledged the seriousness of the situation. “We recognize the trust you place in Tangem, and we are fully committed to maintaining that trust by upholding the highest standards of security and transparency.” Tangem Fixes Security Bug, Promises No Private Key Compromises Tangem swiftly responded by identifying the bug, fixing it, and updating the app to ensure that private keys are no longer logged under any circumstances. To further safeguard users, the company has permanently deleted all logs and attachments sent to its support team and implemented enhanced security protocols to prevent similar issues in the future. Tangem is also reaching out directly to potentially affected users, providing clear instructions on securing their accounts. The company is urging all users to update to the latest version of the Tangem app for optimal security. Additionally, Tangem highlighted its active bug bounty program, which incentivizes security researchers and ethical hackers to identify system vulnerabilities. Tangem reassured its community that no private keys were compromised, no funds were lost, and no unauthorized access occurred due to the bug. Despite the fix, some crypto community members criticized Tangem for its lack of transparency. As of Dec. 31, the company had not announced the issue on its social media platforms, including Twitter, Discord, or Telegram.

In a striking display of vigilance, Vietnam’s Hanoi City Police dismantled an elaborate crypto scam that defrauded victims of $1.17 million, while blockchain sleuths uncovered fresh activity from the notorious “Blockchain Bandit,” a hacker responsible for stealing tens of thousands of Ether by exploiting weak private keys. Blockchain Bandit Resurfaces: Consolidates 51,000 Stolen Ether After Two Years of Dormancy The infamous hacker known as the Blockchain Bandit, who amassed over 51,000 Ether ( ETH ) by exploiting weak private keys, has reappeared on the blockchain radar. After nearly two years of inactivity, the Bandit moved the entirety of the stolen Ether into a single wallet, raising alarm bells across the cryptocurrency community. On Dec. 30, 2024, blockchain investigator ZachXBT reported in a Telegram post that the stolen funds had been transferred from 10 separate wallets into a multi-signature wallet identified as “0xC45…1D542.” The movements occurred in a series of rapid transactions, primarily in batches of 5,000 Ether, between 8:54 PM and 9:18 PM UTC. Before this activity, the stolen funds had remained untouched since Jan. 21, 2023, when they were previously consolidated. Notably, around the same time in 2023, the hacker also transferred 470 Bitcoin (BTC), further cementing their reputation as a significant threat to blockchain security. The Blockchain Bandit’s nefarious activities date back to 2016, with their most audacious operations taking place in 2018. Using a process dubbed ”Ethercombing,” the hacker employed brute-force techniques to search for random private keys. By exploiting faulty code and flawed random number generators, the Bandit uncovered 732 private keys linked to 49,060 transactions, accumulating nearly 45,000 Ether in the process. Crypto security analyst Adrian Bednarek, who coined the term Ethercombing, explained that such exploits were theoretically improbable but became feasible due to vulnerabilities in key generation processes. Speculations on the Hacker's Identity The identity of the Blockchain Bandit remains shrouded in mystery, although some experts, including Bednarek, have suggested that a state actor, potentially North Korea, could be behind the thefts. This theory aligns with broader concerns about state-sponsored cybercrime in the cryptocurrency sector, where digital assets are increasingly targeted for their liquidity and anonymity. The Bandit's resurgence brings attention to a troubling trend in the crypto space: an unprecedented rise in hacking incidents. According to a recent report from on-chain security firm Cyvers, hackers stole over $2.3 billion worth of digital assets in 2024, a staggering 40% increase compared to 2023. These thefts occurred across 165 major incidents, with access control breaches accounting for 81% of the stolen value—equivalent to $1.9 billion. Centralized exchanges and custodian platforms were particularly vulnerable, underscoring the pressing need for improved cybersecurity measures. The uptick in cyberattacks has reignited debates around the security of blockchain networks and the critical importance of robust private key management. The movement of such a significant amount of Ether has triggered widespread speculation about the hacker's motives. Some experts believe the consolidation could precede an attempt to cash out through mixers or decentralized exchanges, while others warn it may signal an escalation in the hacker's activities. ZachXBT’s analysis and transparency efforts have been praised within the crypto community, but the incident also serves as a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities that persist in the blockchain ecosystem. For many, the Blockchain Bandit's exploits are a wake-up call to strengthen security practices at both individual and institutional levels. As the blockchain industry continues to grow, so do the challenges posed by cybercriminals. Innovations like quantum computing and advanced cryptographic techniques are being explored to fortify blockchain security, as highlighted by Adam Back, a prominent figure in the crypto space. However, these advancements are still in their nascent stages and far from foolproof. The Blockchain Bandit saga serves as both a cautionary tale and a call to action. As the community grapples with the implications of this latest development, one thing is clear: the battle for blockchain security is far from over. Hanoi Police Halt $1.17 Million Crypto Scam, Saving 300 Potential Victims The Hanoi City Police Department has thwarted an elaborate cryptocurrency scam that defrauded victims of over 30 billion Vietnamese dong ($1.17 million) and prevented an additional 300 individuals from falling prey to the scheme. The operation targeted unsuspecting Vietnamese citizens and businesses. At the center of the scam was Million Smiles, a company that lured investors with false promises and elaborate marketing tactics. The company promoted a fictitious cryptocurrency called QFS (Quantum Financial System), claiming it offered access to a groundbreaking financial ecosystem. Million Smiles deployed deceptive advertising linking QFS to ancestral treasures and spiritual claims, enticing individuals and businesses with promises of unrealistic returns. The company falsely asserted that owning QFS tokens would provide benefits like collateral-free and interest-free funding. Hanoi police uncovered the scheme when Million Smiles attempted to host a meeting with 300 potential investors. These meetings were aimed at convincing individuals to invest amounts ranging from 4–5 million dong ($190) to 39 million dong ($1,350) for businesses. During a raid on the company’s headquarters, authorities seized documents, computers, and other materials critical to the investigation. Subsequent inquiries confirmed that the QFS token was entirely fictitious and did not comply with Vietnamese law, making the scheme illegal. Before the crackdown, Million Smiles had already defrauded approximately 100 businesses and 400 individuals, exploiting their trust through manipulative marketing and fabricated claims. The company’s methods demonstrate the evolving sophistication of crypto scams in Vietnam and the broader region. Vietnam has demonstrated a robust commitment to combating crypto-related crimes, with multiple crackdowns on fraudulent schemes. In October 2024, police in Nghe An Province, which borders Laos, dismantled a scam network run by offshore actors. This group specialized in ” pig-butchering ” scams—a form of social engineering where scammers build trust with victims over time before deceiving them into making significant financial investments. One victim from Ho Chi Minh City was lured into investing in “Biconomynft,” a fraudulent app promising exorbitant returns. Over several months, the scammer, posing as a woman, stole more than 17.6 billion dong ($700,000) from the victim. Vietnam’s Broader Crypto Landscape Despite its status as one of the world’s leading adopters of blockchain technology, Vietnam remains vigilant against fraud. The government has launched several initiatives to foster blockchain innovation while ensuring investor protection. In recent months, Vietnam released a national blockchain strategy aiming for regional leadership, emphasizing the balance between innovation and regulation. The Million Smiles case places the spotlight on the urgent need for education and awareness about the risks of crypto investments. The promise of quick riches often blinds investors to the red flags associated with such schemes. Law enforcement’s decisive actions, like those seen in Hanoi and Nghe An, serve as a deterrent, but the onus is also on individuals to exercise caution and conduct due diligence.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | ZRX,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6758/crypto-hacker-behind-85-m-ether-heist-reappears-after-two-year-silence,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

Market observers and crypto enthusiasts are drawing parallels between the soaring success of Mystery and the remarkable rise of $PEPE in previous market cycles. This surge is being fueled by a compelling narrative tied to “The Night Riders,” an older publishing by Matt Furie, who also created characters that drove the crypto meme coin trend in 2024. Launched on the Ethereum Network, Mystery Coin has quickly become the topic of energetic discussions across social media platforms, live streams, and crypto-focused forums. The project references Matt Furie’s “The Night Riders,” a publication that preceded his well-known “Boys Club” series. The latter gave rise to popular tokens such as $PEPE, $BRETT, $ANDY, and $WOLF, all of which achieved significant successes in 2024. With the introduction of Mystery, Toki, and Hoodrat—characters from “The Night Riders”—crypto enthusiasts are predicting a new wave of momentum leading into the 2025 bull run. The market capitalization of tokens linked to Matt Furie’s “Boys Club” characters soared collectively to over $10 billion. Many industry watchers are now focusing on the similar potential that “The Night Riders” characters could unlock, and Mystery Coin is rapidly becoming the centerpiece of that speculation. According to its team, Mystery has established a strong foundation with no taxes, a renounced contract, and locked liquidity, reinforcing its identity as a community-centric project. Observers note that Mystery’s lower market capitalization, compared to older meme tokens tied to Furie’s work, creates substantial room for further growth. In addition to its strong community-driven growth, Mystery Coin has already achieved notable milestones, including its listing on GATE.io’s pilot platform and the Binance Wallet, signaling growing recognition from top-tier platforms. These achievements further bolster the token’s credibility and visibility within the crypto space, laying the groundwork for potential future listings on major centralized exchanges. Crypto influencers, including respected personalities such as Davinci, have drawn attention to Mystery’s meteoric rise. Market analysts suggest that social media conversations about Mystery’s rapid appreciation in value, combined with its creative branding and strong community support, have contributed significantly to its current momentum. The Mystery community has also been extremely active, with over 6000 new holders joining in a short span of time, further fueling positive sentiment around the token. Speculation has risen that prominent centralized exchanges (CEXs) are evaluating potential listings for Mystery. The high trading volume and enthusiastic community engagement are reminiscent of the early days of $PEPE’s explosive popularity. Evidence of Mystery’s original connection to Matt Furie’s “The Night Riders” storyline has been shared across various social platforms, reinforcing the sense of authenticity behind the project’s narrative. The name of the frog character in “The Night Riders” is revealed as “Mystery,” a detail that has strengthened the community’s belief in its legitimacy and historical significance. As the project continues to evolve, Mystery’s tokenomics remain straightforward, with a total supply of 420,690,000,000,000 tokens. The team highlights the absence of any tax structure, emphasizing that there are “no tricks and no added complexities,” consistent with their commitment to transparency. The sense of nostalgia tied to the older Matt Furie characters, combined with the potential for continued market interest heading into 2025, further cements Mystery’s position as one of the most watched meme coins in the space. Speaking on behalf of the team, a spokesperson for Mystery Coin noted that their focus is on growing a robust community. “The engagement and excitement around Mystery have been incredible,” commented the representative. “We believe in the strong legacy of Matt Furie’s characters, and we are thrilled to see such rapid and enthusiastic support from crypto enthusiasts worldwide. Our priority is to honor that heritage by maintaining a transparent and user-friendly environment for all our holders.” For more information visit https://furies-mystery.com .

Trump the Grinch (TRUMPGRI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPGRI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump the Grinch can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump the Grinch could become the next viral memecoin. Trump the Grinch launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump the Grinch on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump the Grinch by entering its contract address – 93BLFCVkzBwnSUUjiyaVRQSpjEvaXdZe3oS3iyHnhind – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPGRI.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Lunex Network rises as a top contender, with analysts predicting it could surpass XRP and TRON by Q1 2025 thanks to its trading solutions and soaring presale demand. Table of Contents Lunex Network promises huge gains XRP battles bearish pressure TRON price dips after ATH Lunex Network set to outpace XRP and TRON Lunex Network (LNEX) is quickly grabbing the interest of investors as Ripple (XRP) and TRON (TRX) deal with mixed signals. Analysts currently estimate Lunex Network may soon exceed XRP and TRX by Q1 2025 with its approach to crypto trading and massive investor demand for the limited LNEX token supply. Though XRP and TRX have great promise, why are seasoned investors beginning to diversify into Lunex Network? Read on to discover the creative elements of Lunex Network and the reasons it might well be the next big thing in cryptocurrencies. Lunex Network promises huge gains Within a perfect, user-friendly application, Lunex Network provides a unique crypto wallet that improves the maintenance, trading, and exchanging of over 50,000 cryptocurrencies across 40+ blockchains. Perfect cross-chain swaps from Lunex Network give users a better and more reasonably priced trading environment than those of single-blockchain decentralized exchanges like Uniswap and PancakeSwap. Though it also helps companies to safely accept crypto payments globally, this ultra-low-fee, non-custodial platform is quickly attracting high-frequency traders and investors searching for a faster and more reasonable approach to trade and handle their crypto assets. From its starting $0.0012 presale price to the current $0.0049 pricing, the Lunex Network presale has seen an amazing rise; the LNEX token has risen by over 300% in just a few months. Having already sold more than 2.4 billion LNEX tokens, this shows great investor interest and increasing faith in Lunex Network’s future potential. Lunex Network offers a chance for massive profits with analysts forecasting a 500% gain by the end of the presale and a possible 50x return after the token launches on multiple exchanges in Q1 2025. You might also like: Holiday rally incoming: PEPE and NEAR prepare for moonshot as Lunex presale hits $5.5M XRP battles bearish pressure Over the past week, the XRP price has seen a notable fall, more than 13%. The series of lower highs and lower lows that have molded the recent market action on the XRP price chart clearly shows this bearish trend, which resulted in a plunge below the $1.99 support level. The XRP price has shown resilience, meanwhile, breaking back over the $2.2 level in spite of the bearish momentum. XRP has had a tremendous comeback over the previous month, rising more than 55%, therefore demonstrating its potential for further rallies. XRP has repeatedly faced rejection around the $2.7 zone, but analysts still hope for a positive breakout before the year ends. Technical indicators are mainly positive; the Momentum Oscillator, MACD, and Moving Averages hint at purchasing prospects on the XRP price chart. The Commodity Channel Index (CCI) shows some bearish signs, but generally, XRP’s price structure looks bullish. TRON price dips after ATH With a prior week drop of more than 13%, the TRON price has been under notable negative pressure lately. After reaching a fresh all-time high of $0.44 on December 4, the TRON price had a significant decline and fell below the $0.26 support level. The TRON price is now hovering just above the $0.23 support zone, where the altcoin has seen rejection from this fall. Still, many TRON holders, especially those purchasing the dips, anticipate a possible breakout as the market stabilizes. Despite recent price swings, the TRON price chart shows that the altcoin has exhibited a notable increase over the previous month, rising by 17%, indicating a great optimistic sentiment. With the Momentum Oscillator, MACD, and Moving Averages all pointing toward bullish momentum, the technical indicators on the TRON price chart also provide hopeful signals. These signals imply that TRON might shortly undergo a recovery and perhaps break out in the bullish direction despite the current negative pressure. Lunex Network set to outpace XRP and TRON While XRP and TRX negotiate changing market conditions, Lunex Network is fast rising as a very promising competitor. Lunex Network is drawing a flood of investors looking for greater flexibility and better profits with its creative cross-chain swaps, ultra-low fees, and strong crypto wallet supporting over 50,000 coins. Crypto aficionados have taken notice of the 300% increase in LNEX token value and its increasing momentum in the presale phase while projections indicate possible 50x gains post-launch in Q1 2025.

With its innovative GameFi ecosystem, Yeti Ouro has attracted seasoned investors from other well-known and established coins like Shiba Inu and XRP. Celebrating the New Year with Yeti Ouro from December 31 to January 2, investors will enjoy a 25% bonus on purchases. This initiative reflects Yeti Ouro's commitment to kicking off 2025 with valuable rewards and exciting opportunities for its community. Introducing Yeti Ouro: The Game-Changer In Gaming And Crypto Investing Yeti Ouro is more than a crypto; it's a groundbreaking ecosystem that blends blockchain technology with the fascinating gaming domain. At its heart is Yeti Go, an ultra-competitive racing game built on the Unreal Engine. It features power-ups, environmental hazards, and interactive elements that interact during the game PvP (Player vs Player) gameplay that is unlike anything. Tokenomics And Presale Success The YETIO token powers our ecosystem from staking to the marketplace to token burning. While the second stage of the presale is gaining considerable traction, investors have already achieved a profit of over 40% during the presale. This launch and the anticipated 25% New Year bonus to investors will indeed generate more interest in the ever-growing project. Community And Engagement The Yeti Ouro jet pack squad has almost exclusively focused on community interaction with referral initiatives and meme competitions, keeping its expanding community of users invested and active in the project's ongoing success. These efforts contribute to generating hype as well as cultivating a dedicated and interactive audience. Why Experts Are Bullish Crypto analysts firmly believe in Yeti Ouro's potential due to its strong utility, innovative gaming model, and the team's commitment to creating a sustainable ecosystem. Yeti Ouro's presale is already off to a great start, with projections betting on huge gains for 2025 Yeti Ouro stands to shake up the crypto game. XRP Price Prediction: A Long-Term Powerhouse As for XRP, as a coin that has passed a bit of time, its price is currently $2.08 . XRP is known for its efficiency in cross-border payments and is often seen as a viable option for long-term investors. XRP price has remained resilient throughout the ongoing legal battles with the SEC, demonstrating a strong community and continued adoption. 7-day XRP price chart- source: CoinMarketCap XRP’s growth story is usually linked to extrinsic factors such as the regulatory environment, which may cap near-term explosive growth. Enter Yeti Ouro, a high-growth opportunity paired with a nascent gaming ecosystem. Shiba Inu Coin Price Prediction: The Meme Coin With A Purpose Shiba Inu coin has evolved significantly from its roots as a meme coin, developing an ecosystem encompassing decentralised exchange, staking, and NFT projects. SHIB price trading at $0.00002107 , with the proper management, can move beyond being meme-coins and create a third wave of cryptocurrency investors in its community. 7- day Shiba Inu Price chart- source: CoinMarketCap Although Shiba Inu has gained some utility through its new initiatives, it remains largely driven by market sentiment. On the other hand, Yeti Ouro has practical use combined with a creative gaming platform, making it a more calculated investment for investors looking for both short-term profit and long-term value. The Difference That Makes Yeti Ouro The Only Choice With its unique blend of utility, community involvement, and innovative gaming, Yeti Ouro is sure to catch the attention of investors seeking to get in on the next big thing. The presale positive aspect and the New Year bonus make it a singular entry point for dividend enthusiasts. Moreover, its P2E model guarantees a steady demand for the YETIO token, driving value for gamers and investors. Conclusion While XRP and Shiba Inu are dominating the headlines in the crypto world, Yeti Ouro is quietly establishing itself as a revolutionary project that has the potential to change forever and possibly save lives. An innovative ecosystem, solid tokenomics, and fervent community growth power Yeti Ouro’s unique investment proposition for 2025 and beyond. With this 25% New Year bonus, the time may be right to enter this revolutionary project.

38345326,https://crypto.news/?p=14323596,1735650609,Cardano co-founder explores Delimited continuations: What does it mean for Cardano?,"The co-founder of Cardano, Charles Hoskinson, got the crypto world excited with just a hint towards the possibility that delimited continuations might be executed into the Cardano blockchain in 2025. Earlier this month, on Dec. 22, Hoskinson had said 2025 will be ADA’s year . Now, many crypto enthusiasts believe delimited continuations might be the new technological addition that the co-founder had been hinting at. Although such a phrase does sound very hefty to consider, its impacts can indeed reflect a legitimate impression on the execution of Cardano ( ADA ) and the consequences of its developments and investments. Next year, Cardano is going to heights it's never been before. We got Bitcoin DeFi, Midnight, Patnerchains, all the DApp upgrades, Midgard, and some extra magic that we'll call ""the fire rises"" pic.twitter.com/ITI6S7mHun — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) December 31, 2024 What are Delimited continuations? Delimited continuations are a programming construct that allows a programmer to suspend an ongoing computation and later continue it. There is a potential for increased performance and customization in the running of ADA’s smart contracts programs designed to undertake actions fully automatically under certain conditions. I had a two hour discussion last night about adding delimited continuations to Cardano. Any opinions? — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) December 31, 2024 Hoskinson brought into the limelight two significant use cases of delimited continuations for the ADA ecosystem. First, they may allow differentiation of on-chain (stored on the blockchain) and off-chain (external) computations in zero-knowledge proofs , which are extremely important to the Cardano project Midnight. Second, they can provide a new way of thinking about classical state machine architectures, making it easier to write and execute smart contracts. You might also like: Unlock massive 1000x gains: Analysts favor new SOL meme coin over ADA and SUI for 2025 Why this matters to Cardano investors This exploration for investors means that ADA is innovating in the blockchain space. Improving smart contract capabilities, as Hoskinson has been focusing on, fits into the broader goal of getting more decentralized applications on the platform. A more developer-friendly platform could increase adoption, and this may lead to increased demand for its native cryptocurrency, ADA. You might also like: Crypto whales: Friends or foes? However, there are challenges. Speaking for his company, Hoskinson mentioned that delimited continuations aren’t an easy thing to implement. ADA uses the Plutus smart contract platform, whose computational rules are rigid than Haskell’s. This, Hoskinson says, might increase developmental costs and time, thus delaying the anticipated benefits by investors. The issue is that while haskell is a lazy language, plutus is strict. This greatly complicates the actual implementation. We do have DC support in Haskell since GHC 9.6 thanks to Alexis's hard work at @tweagio . I suspect we could use freer monads as a path to DC support. It… — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) December 31, 2024 What the Cardano community thinks This crypto community has already been weighing in. Developers like @bitcodyy on X see delimited continuations to optimize complex computations, providing DApp developers with flexibility. While others are rather cautious of its unintended consequences, namely having an even higher cost or issues with maintaining decentralization. https://twitter.com/bitcodyy/status/1873961163656224899 What’s next for Cardano? For new investors, the answer is clear: ADA could stay ahead of time. This whole exploration into delimited continuations testifies to the blockchain’s ambition to at least stay parallel with platforms like Ethereum since the latter has an upper hand in its smart contract application. Whether these innovations pay off is yet to be seen, but for someone who wants to invest in a blockchain technology that will be of interest in the long term, Hoskinson’s vision for Cardano makes it a project to keep a close eye on. Meanwhile, the developments surrounding Midnight, Cardano’s zero-knowledge-proof solution, and delimited continuations could have an impact on the future of the platform’s ecosystem. The success or failure of Cardano’s pursuit of these cutting-edge ideas will probably define its place in the crypto market for years to come.

38345288,https://crypto.news/?p=14292818,1735650469,What are Bitcoin Ordinals?,"Bitcoin has come a long way since launching in 2009 as a fairly obscure form of digital cash. The project would go relatively unnoticed by the general public for several years, gaining popularity in 2013 and skyrocketing to become the largest asset class in the world. In fact, while Bitcoin was the first-ever cryptocurrency, its invention prompted thousands of new cryptocurrencies to follow suit, with complex use cases, expansive derivative markets, and a growing list of features added on. Bitcoin developers have also continued to innovate on the project, with the biggest update in recent years being Bitcoin Ordinals, which rolled out in 2023. Table of Contents What are Bitcoin Ordinals? Bitcoin Ordinals explained How do Bitcoin Ordinals work? Buying, selling, and trading Bitcoin Ordinals Real-world examples and use cases Potential Challenges and Downsides of Bitcoin Ordinals What are Bitcoin Ordinals? Bitcoin Ordinals explained Bitcoin Ordinals are Bitcoin’s answer to NFTs, allowing a way of inscribing data onto a specific satoshi (one-millionth of a bitcoin) in a way that makes that satoshi distinct from others or non-fungible. You might also like: Ordinals explained: New era of NFTs on Bitcoin network? So why is this important? Originally, Bitcoin was launched as a fungible form of digital cash. Like a US dollar, one is much the same as the other as far as the people transacting are concerned. However, Bitcoin Ordinals allow users to identify satoshis from one another. For example, a collector might be interested in owning a satoshi from a crucial moment in Bitcoin’s history, like the Bitcoin halving that takes place every four years, and thus be willing to spend more than the market value of one satoshi to buy it. This leads Bitcoin into the realm of digital collectables and NFTs. The Ethereum NFT (non-fungible token) market exploded in 2021, with over $24 billion in sales of NFTs. These NFTs are typically digital assets on the Ethereum network with unique identifying numbers and were used to represent ownership of assets like art and music. Bitcoin Ordinals could be used for exactly the same thing, with the added benefit of being associated with the most popular and long-standing cryptocurrency on the market. How do Bitcoin Ordinals work? Bitcoin Ordinals assign a unique identifier number to the satoshis in any given bitcoin. Bitcoin developer Casey Rodarmor introduced the idea in 2023 and used a feature of Bitcoin’s 2021 Taproot upgrade, which allowed for data to be stored directly on the Bitcoin blockchain to make it happen. Ordinals work by making each unit of a single bitcoin uniquely identifiable. When a bitcoin is mined, all one million satoshis are assigned a number in the order of their creation. Satoshis can be tracked individually across multiple wallets, meaning you can spend BTC and still keep track of individual satoshis or Ordinals. Whereas Ethereum NFTs sometimes require metadata to be stored off-chain, sometimes on a traditional web2 website, Bitcoin Ordinal data is all stored on-chain, reducing the risk of data loss. The SegWit and Taproot updates to the Bitcoin network allow for a lot of data to be stored in this manner. Buying, selling, and trading Bitcoin Ordinals To buy Bitcoin Ordinals, you’ll need to use a wallet that is compatible with Taproot addresses. Many of the most popular Bitcoin wallets, such as Trust Wallet, Mycelium, and Blockchain.com wallets, do not support this feature. You can use wallets like Sparrow Wallet instead. Bitcoin addresses that are compatible with taproot usually start with the characters ‘bc1p’. How to buy Bitcoin Ordinals With your wallet set up, you can visit marketplaces like Ordinals Market or OpenOrdex to take a look at the ordinals on offer. As with Ethereum NFTs, these ordinals will often be associated with the sale of digital artwork or other assets. Deposit your funds to the platform (at your own risk) or connect your BTC wallet. From there, bid on an Ordinal or simply make a direct purchase. That’s how it’s done! You can also list Ordinals for sale on the same platform or trade them peer-to-peer with other users. Real-world examples and use cases Bitcoin Ordinals can be used to represent the sale of digital or real-world assets, to act as a collectable piece of BTC network history, or to permanently inscribe data to an immutable blockchain as a form of censorship-resistant art, protest, or historic preservation. At the moment, the main use case lies in artwork, much like with Ethereum NFTs. The market for Bitcoin Ordinals is relatively small, although not insignificant. Sales of BTC Ordinals reached over $170 million in March 2024. Examples of Bitcoin Ordinals could include collecting ‘souvenirs’ from history, allowing users to own a piece of a bitcoin from a certain moment in time, such as a major world event or simply an interesting moment in Bitcoin’s mining history. Potential Challenges and Downsides of Bitcoin Ordinals Of course, we’ve already seen the market for Ethereum NFTs take a massive drop in recent years, with the value of NFT collectables falling around 90% overall. While the technology isn’t going anywhere, the market quickly became saturated with low-effort artwork, aggressive marketing practices, and shady or abusive trading tactics such as wash trading to artificially inflate auction prices. It’s safe to say that the market has taken a step back from NFTs and that this muted sentiment may also carry over to Bitcoin Ordinals as well for the near future. Another issue with Ordinals is one of privacy and surveillance. By allowing unique identifying data to be inscribed on individual millionths of every bitcoin, the fungibility and pseudonymous nature of Bitcoin is arguably threatened. https://twitter.com/TheDesertLynx/status/1734263809336824191 Ordinals allow for on-chain surveillance analysts to cluster wallets and identify Bitcoin users with greater ease, which some people may disagree with. Finally, there’s potentially a risk of creating a derivatives market that could upset BTC prices. If Ordinals were to take off in a big way, there’s the possibility that users spending big money on specific millionths of a Bitcoin could have unforeseen effects on the price of Bitcoin and the health of the market, although this is merely speculation at the time of writing. Whatever happens with Bitcoin Ordinals, the technology has been warmly welcomed by a great many cryptocurrency enthusiasts, and the market looks set to develop further over the coming months and years.

38345194,https://crypto.news/?p=14323031,1735650300,The gaming industry can finally solve its biggest problem | Opinion,"Disclosure: The views and opinions expressed here belong solely to the author and do not represent the views and opinions of crypto.news’ editorial. Gaming is booming. In 2023, the industry surpassed $455 billion in revenue, overtaking traditional sports and Hollywood combined. But behind this record-breaking growth lies a fractured ecosystem that holds everyone back. Studios, guilds, and players are spread across disconnected platforms, from Discord and Twitch to Telegram and Steam. These silos fragment communities and make scaling and engagement a frustrating uphill battle. You might also like: GameFi investment is surging: Blockchain becomes a staple in every title | Opinion This isn’t just inconvenient, it’s costly. Studios invest millions trying to acquire players across multiple channels, with mobile developers often facing the challenge of rapidly declining retention rates within a week. Guilds struggle to build cohesive communities when players are scattered across platforms. For gamers, the friction of managing multiple apps and accounts dampens what should be an exciting, seamless experience. The problem of fragmentation The gaming ecosystem is massive but deeply divided. Steam and Epic Games compete for exclusivity between platforms, forcing players to juggle accounts and downloads. Mobile gaming, now accounting for 53% of global gaming revenue, operates in a completely different world from console and PC gaming. Discord’s 19 million active servers foster conversations but lack direct integration with gameplay or tournaments. Meanwhile, web3 gamers gather on Telegram, and the streaming giant Twitch hosts 31 million daily viewers who are disconnected from the core gameplay experience. These divides aren’t just logistical headaches, they’re barriers to growth. Studios face rising marketing costs to reach players across these silos. Guilds struggle to scale and retain members. Gamers, the most critical stakeholders, are forced to navigate a fragmented and overly complex ecosystem that limits discovery, engagement, and connection. The result? Lost opportunities for everyone. Studios miss out on cost-effective scaling. Guilds fail to engage and monetize their communities. Players face friction instead of seamless enjoyment. A unified ecosystem An integrated ecosystem built on existing infrastructure could transform the gaming experience entirely. By integrating communities, studios, and guilds into a single ecosystem, the barriers of fragmentation could be dismantled, allowing for effortless scaling and engagement. For studios, this means tapping into pre-built communities and sidestepping the need for massive marketing budgets or complex integrations. Guilds could grow and retain members more effectively without the logistical headaches of managing across platforms. Players, in turn, could discover games, join tournaments, and earn rewards—all without the friction of multiple downloads, sign-ups, or accounts. Beyond connection: The future of gaming While unifying the ecosystem is a necessary first step, it’s just the beginning. Other challenges loom, such as cheating, which 59% of gamers identify as their biggest frustration. Community-driven oversight networks could eliminate bots and ensure fairness at scale, helping to restore trust in competitive gaming. Transparency is another critical priority. Blockchain-powered tools could ensure tamper-proof match results and secure prize pools, fostering accountability and trust. According to Deloitte, greater transparency increases player retention by 35%, underscoring its value for the gaming industry. Finally, engaging broader audiences, even non-gamers, is another opportunity. Prediction markets that allow users to forecast tournament outcomes could offer an interactive layer, inviting new participants into the gaming ecosystem. Unlocking infinite opportunities Fragmentation has long been a barrier to the gaming industry’s full potential, limiting collaboration, stifling community growth, and creating silos between players, guilds, and studios. By addressing this challenge head-on, the industry has the chance to redefine how gaming ecosystems operate. Studios can scale efficiently, leveraging unified platforms to reduce acquisition costs while reaching broader, more engaged audiences. Guilds can foster vibrant, sustainable communities where collaboration and competition thrive, creating spaces where players feel truly connected. For players, a unified gaming world means an end to disjointed experiences. Instead, they can immerse themselves in seamless ecosystems that transcend individual games, enabling fluid progress, shared rewards, and meaningful social interactions. This next phase of gaming evolution offers limitless opportunities, not just for economic growth but also for cultural and creative innovation. By uniting developers, communities, and gamers, the industry can build a future defined by fairness, inclusivity, and a shared passion for play. This isn’t just the next step forward for gaming—it’s a transformation that redefines what’s possible.

Platforms like Uniswap, PancakeSwap, and Solana’s Raydium led the way as more people turned to DeFi for secure and direct trading without middlemen. DEXs hit record $463 billion in December trading This December, trading volumes on DEXs reached heights of $463 billion. The data tracked by Defillama shows how much decentralized trading platforms impact DeFi and the broader cryptocurrency space. Trading volume continued growing in the fourth quarter of 2024. In October, it reached $194.74 billion; in November, it reached $374 billion; and finally, it peaked in December. This is the continuation of a rise of DEXs to become the safest and most efficient method to trade directly with one another, excluding the middleman. The Solana blockchain network topped the list of DEX trading platforms with $115 billion in transactions. Coming in at second, Binance Smart Chain recorded the all-time highest traded volume of $98 billion. Ethereum-based DEXs had $88.47 billion in trades and remained a considerable contributor to the DeFi ecosystem. Of note, the Coinbase-backed Base network saw $52 billion in trading volume. Uniswap, PancakeSwap, and Raydium lead the way Uniswap was still at the top in the non-custodial individual platform leaderboard, with $106.4 billion over the month. PancakeSwap ranked second, racking up $96.4 billion in user trade activity. In third place was the Solana-based DEX, Raydium, which posted its best month as transaction volumes attained $58 billion. Next came Aerodrome at $31 billion and Orca at $22 billion in volume. The attractiveness of DEXs among investors stems from transparency, security, and accessibility. Besides, no intermediary makes it easier for users to keep control over assets, a very big advantage in an era of increasing concern for privacy and data security. While other areas appear promising for the immediate future, decentralized exchanges remain at the front lines as the most popular crypto offerings. $463 billion in trading volumes in December is a record-breaking month; it could also be an indicator of better performances once the pro-crypto Trump administration takes office.

38351042,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=106930,1735650016,WallStreetBets Founder Predicts XRP Price if Global Crypto Market Cap Hits $5T,"WallStreetBets founder Jaime Rogozinski has used the recent XRP surge to speculate on its potential if the broader crypto market cap hits $5 trillion. XRP remains one of the top gainers in the latest bull rally, soaring by over 400% within a month. Specifically, XRP’s price surged to a seven-year high of $2.86 on December 3, a five-fold increase from its November low of around $0.49. At the time, it reclaimed the third position in the global crypto ranking. Even though XRP has slumped heavily below its seven-year peak, Rogozinski still believes it could surge tremendously if the broader crypto market clinches a $5 trillion valuation in 2025.XRP Price if Global Crypto Market Cap Reaches $5TAt the time of writing, the global crypto market is valued at $3.33 trillion. XRP currently accounts for 3.6% of this valuation, with its market cap currently standing at $119.05 billion. According to Rogozinski’s projection, the global crypto market cap must surge by 50.15% to clinch the $5 trillion target.If this happens, Rogozinski predicted that the price of XRP will soar to $8, representing a surge of 263.63% from the current value of $2.2. This dramatic surge will represent a significant return on investment for holders. For instance, investors who spend $27,500 today to acquire 12,500 XRP would see their investment rise to $100,000 if the coin’s price hits the $8 target. XRP to $8 PredictionsMeanwhile, several market experts have forecasted XRP’s potential rally to $8 if the global crypto market cap rises to $5 trillion. This estimation gained momentum earlier the year after Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse projected that the value of the crypto market could increase to $5 trillion by the end of this year. Last month, prominent crypto analyst EGRAG predicted that XRP could surge to $8.77 if Garlinghouse’s prediction materializes. Earlier this month, EGRAG noted that XRP is capable of soaring to $8.1 as long as the coin maintains bullish momentum. However, he emphasized that Bitcoin’s performance, particularly its potential surge to around $130,000, is a crucial catalyst for XRP’s possible rally to the $8.1 target. Investors Optimistic About XRP Potential Under Trump Administration In the meantime, investors are optimistic about XRP’s potential under the next administration, led by Donald Trump. His unending support for the crypto industry has birthed speculations that the SEC v. Ripple lawsuit, which has negatively impacted XRP’s performance over the past few years, could soon be resolved . Amid this speculation, some market observers also forecasted that the U.S. SEC might approve one or multiple XRP ETF S-1 filings next year, potentially driving the coin’s price to unprecedented levels.",POSITIVE,XRP,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/31/wallstreetbets-founder-predicts-xrp-price-if-global-crypto-market-cap-hits-5t/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wallstreetbets-founder-predicts-xrp-price-if-global-crypto-market-cap-hits-5t,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Alongside Lightchain AI, meme-inspired BRETT and established player AVAX are also turning heads as top picks for investors aiming to capitalize on 2024's altcoin surge. BRETT Token- The Meme Coin Turning Heads in 2024 BRETT is a meme coin launched in February 2024 on Coinbase's Base blockchain, inspired by a character from Matt Furie's ""Boy's Club"" comic series. It has rapidly become the largest meme coin on Base by market capitalization, reaching over $1.32 billion. BRETT's success is largely attributed to its community-driven approach; the contract was renounced, placing control entirely in the hands of its users. This grassroots engagement has propelled BRETT to outperform many competitors, with its price increasing by 400% over the past month. As 2024 concludes, BRETT stands out as a leading meme coin, exemplifying the power of community involvement in the crypto space.

With partnerships like Chainlink, Aave, and SushiSwap, AVAX is poised to continue its upward trajectory in the coming years. Why Lightchain AI is Revolutionizing Blockchain with AI Integration Lightchain AI is revolutionizing blockchain technology by seamlessly integrating artificial intelligence (AI) to address key challenges in scalability, privacy, and efficiency. At its core, it introduces the Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism, which rewards nodes for performing valuable AI computations like model training and optimization, enhancing network security while contributing to AI advancements. Additionally, the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) serves as a specialized computational layer optimized for executing AI-specific tasks directly on the blockchain. This integration enables real-time AI applications across various industries, including healthcare, finance, and supply chain management, fostering a more decentralized and efficient ecosystem. By merging AI with blockchain, Lightchain AI is setting a new standard for decentralized intelligence, promoting transparency, inclusivity, and equitable decision-making in the digital age.

38344949,https://coinpedia.org/?p=400482,1735649799,Ethereum Stands Strong Aganist Bitcoin-Here’s When it May Trigger an Altcoin Rally in 2025,"The post Ethereum Stands Strong Aganist Bitcoin-Here’s When it May Trigger an Altcoin Rally in 2025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The year 2024 turned out to be bullish for the cryptos, with new tokens gaining massive profits along with Bitcoin & Ethereum. While Bitcoin managed to mark a new ATH above $108K, Ethereum failed to sustain above $4000. Meanwhile, the sluggish trend of the ETH price rally failed to disappoint the market participants as they continued to be bullish on the second-largest token. Therefore, the price is expected to revamp a strong upswing in the upcoming days that could elevate the levels beyond $5000 soon. Besides, the big moves in the world of spot ETFs have been recorded as BlackRock’s ETH holdings now surpass 1M ETH worth over $3.6B. The institutions are accumulating millions of ETH every day and on the other hand, the whales also accumulated huge amounts of ETH during the recent dip. As per the reports, an Ethereum whale accumulated more than $77 million ETH, which hints towards a potential rally for the token in 2025. A whale bought 22,919 $ETH ($77.2M) at an average price of $3,368 again 4 hours ago. Since Aug 12, this whale has made 25 swing trades in $ETH and $WBTC , 21 of which were profitable, with a win rate of 84%, and a total profit of $4.57M. https://t.co/LGiKOWKUqz pic.twitter.com/smncJ2Qnhp — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) December 31, 2024 The rise in the accumulation during the latest dip suggests the trading strategy of the bulls, who remain bullish on ETH but under the shadows. The traders are not openly backing the token by inducing the required liquidity but eventually holding the price above the crucial support zone. This suggests the bulls are vigilant and may regain their dominance very soon; that may not only trigger a fine ETH rally but also a potential altseason. What to Expect From the ETH Price Rally in Q1 2025? Historically, the ETH price has always managed to attract significant gains in the first few weeks of the year and hence more possibilities of yet another bull run can be expected in the coming weeks. On the other hand, Bitcoin dominance has always seen a drop in the first few days of January, which has triggered a fine upswing in the ETH price rally. Presently, the price seems to have reached the end of the consolidation and hence a strong rebound could be fast approaching. The weekly chart of Ethereum is incremental as the token forms constant higher highs and lows and despite a major hindrance at $4000, the bulls are poised to elevate the levels to $5000 in the first few weeks of 2025. Meanwhile, the weekly MACD displays a drop in the buying pressure, but the RSI is undergoing a parabolic recovery. Therefore, the price may witness a small drop to $3200, which could attract more buying volume and later trigger a healthy upswing beyond the crucial resistance at $4100. In the meantime, a bearish crossover with the MACD & signal line needs to be prevented that could keep up the possibility of a healthy ascending trend and eventually mark a new ATH above $5000 soon. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

He believes this move could boost financial security, stimulate the local cryptocurrency industry, and attract more investment. Jiexhuang suggested that Hong Kong allocate part of its foreign exchange funds to acquire and hold BTC for the long term. He argued that incorporating BTC as a reserve asset could enhance Hong Kong's role as a global financial hub and increase revenue through transaction stamp taxes. By leveraging China’s one country, two systems framework , Hong Kong could take an early lead in the growing adoption of cryptocurrencies. He noted that if major economies begin adding Bitcoin to their strategic reserves, it would stabilize BTC’s value, encourage global adoption, and shift investment away from traditional assets. This, in turn, could lower the value of conventional reserves, reducing their attractiveness. Jiexhuang acknowledged the risks of investing in Bitcoin and recommended starting with a small allocation of fiscal reserves, focusing initially on Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). He emphasized the importance of studying the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF market’s impact on the financial industry before making significant moves. Hong Kong already has a spot Bitcoin ETF market , but its performance lags behind the U.S. market. This proposal aligns with a similar suggestion made earlier by legislative council member Johnny Ng in July 2024. Both lawmakers cited the potential benefits of following the U.S., where former President Donald Trump announced plans to create a national Bitcoin reserve during a Bitcoin conference in Nashville. Advocates believe Hong Kong’s adoption of BTC as a reserve asset could attract global talent and strengthen its position as a leader in financial innovation. Germany is also considering BTC adoption as a reserve asset, reflecting a growing global interest in cryptocurrencies as part of fiscal strategies.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/hong-kong-lawmaker-proposes-adding-bitcoin-to-fiscal-reserves-for-financial-growth,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/38344954.jpeg

38346668,https://cryptonews.com/?p=323711,1735649528,816 Million DOGE Moved in Just One Hour – Is a Massive Sell-Off Brewing?,"In a significant development, two major Dogecoin transactions totaling 816 million DOGE, worth approximately $259 million, were detected within just over an hour. Whale Alert, a blockchain tracking service, identified the transfers, which involved 466,890,148 DOGE (valued at $149.1 million) and 350,000,000 DOGE ($109.9 million). These large movements have triggered speculation about whether a major sell-off or strategic accumulation is underway. 466,890,148 #DOGE (149,137,073 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to unknown wallet https://t.co/j5ByZXTJ60 — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) December 30, 2024 The smaller transfer was executed from seven blockchain addresses and deposited into two wallets, hinting at possible consolidation or redistribution. The larger transfer combined fifteen smaller transactions from three wallets. Notably, Dogecoin prices dipped by 3.44% shortly after the transfers but have since recovered slightly, with DOGE trading at $0.31077 at the time of writing, down from $0.32055. DOGE Technical Analysis: Dogecoin Remains Range-Bound Dogecoin (DOGE/USD) is currently trading at $0.3202, reflecting a modest 0.25% decline over the last 24 hours. The meme cryptocurrency remains the 7th largest by market cap, valued at $47.2 billion. Dogecoin has been consolidating in a tight range between $0.3245 and $0.3035, indicating subdued volatility and a cautious market. 816M DOGE moved in 1 hour! Valued at $259M, two massive whale transactions spark speculation. Is this a sell-off or strategic play? DOGE trading at $0.3202, key levels to watch: $0.3245 resistance, $0.3035 support. #Dogecoin #CryptoAnalysis #CryptoNews pic.twitter.com/ANyiBY8Ecb — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) December 31, 2024 The 4-hour chart shows DOGE trading below its 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $0.3245, suggesting short-term bearish momentum. Immediate resistance is observed at $0.3245, with further hurdles at $0.3418 and $0.3586. Key support lies at $0.3035, followed by $0.2850 and $0.2626. These levels will be critical in determining DOGE’s next directional move. The RSI (Relative Strength Index) is at 51, reflecting neutral conditions and signaling room for potential breakout activity. A decisive breach above $0.3245 could propel Dogecoin toward higher resistance zones, while a drop below $0.3035 might accelerate selling pressure toward deeper support levels. Factors Influencing Dogecoin’s Price Action Several factors could influence Dogecoin’s trajectory in the coming days: Whale Activity: The recent transfers could signal either strategic positioning by large investors or preparation for increased volatility. Market Sentiment: Dogecoin’s tight trading range suggests investors are waiting for a catalyst, such as regulatory news or broader crypto market trends. Technical Setup: The triple-bottom pattern near $0.3035 reinforces the importance of support levels in sustaining bullish sentiment. Key Takeaways: Massive Transfers: Over 816 million DOGE moved in two transactions, valued at $259 million, raising questions about whale strategies. Technical Levels: DOGE faces resistance at $0.3245 and support at $0.3035, signaling potential breakout zones. Neutral Momentum: RSI at 51 reflects market indecision, leaving room for significant price moves. Traders should monitor these key levels and whale activity closely to assess the next potential market shift for Dogecoin.

38344820,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=116530,1735649491,"U.S. Spot Ethereum ETFs Experience $55.5 Million Net Outflows on December 30, 2024","On December 30, 2024 , U.S. spot Ethereum Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) witnessed a substantial combined net outflow of $55.5 million , according to data from Farside Investors . This significant withdrawal activity was spearheaded by major players in the ETF market, including Fidelity’s FETH , Grayscale’s ETHE and ETH , and Franklin Templeton’s EZET . Understanding the reasons behind these outflows and their implications for the Ethereum market and ETF investors is crucial for stakeholders navigating the evolving cryptocurrency investment landscape. 1. Breakdown of Net Outflows 1.1 Fidelity’s FETH Leading the Outflow Fidelity’s FETH led the pack with a net outflow of $20.4 million . As one of the most prominent Ethereum ETFs, FETH’s significant withdrawals indicate a notable shift in investor sentiment or strategy. 1.2 Grayscale’s ETHE and ETH Following Grayscale’s ETHE saw a net outflow of $17.4 million , while Grayscale’s ETH experienced $13.8 million in withdrawals. These figures highlight Grayscale’s substantial presence in the Ethereum ETF market and the considerable movement of funds within its products. 1.3 Franklin Templeton’s EZET Franklin Templeton’s EZET reported a net outflow of $3.9 million , contributing to the overall decline in spot Ethereum ETF investments. Although smaller in comparison to Fidelity and Grayscale, EZET’s outflows still reflect a significant investor response. 1.4 Other ETFs’ Performance The remaining U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs did not report any significant net inflows or outflows on December 30, 2024, suggesting a consolidation of investor positions within the leading ETFs. 2. Factors Influencing the Net Outflows 2.1 Market Volatility and Ethereum’s Price Fluctuations Cryptocurrency markets are inherently volatile, and Ethereum (ETH) is no exception. Price fluctuations and market uncertainty can lead investors to withdraw funds from ETFs to manage risk or reallocate their portfolios. 2.2 Macro-Economic Indicators Global economic conditions, including interest rate changes, inflation concerns, and geopolitical events, can impact investor confidence and influence the movement of funds in and out of Ethereum ETFs. 2.3 Regulatory Developments Ongoing regulatory scrutiny and potential changes in cryptocurrency regulations can affect investor sentiment. Uncertainty about future regulations may prompt investors to reduce their exposure to Ethereum ETFs. 2.4 Profit-Taking and Portfolio Rebalancing Investors may choose to take profits after significant gains or rebalance their portfolios to maintain desired asset allocations. This strategic movement can result in net outflows from specific ETFs. 3. Implications for the Ethereum Market 3.1 Impact on Ethereum’s Price While ETF outflows can exert downward pressure on Ethereum’s price, the direct correlation between ETF movements and cryptocurrency prices is complex. Other market factors, including direct trading on exchanges and institutional investments, also play significant roles. 3.2 Investor Sentiment and Market Confidence Significant outflows from major ETFs like FETH and Grayscale’s products may indicate waning investor confidence or shifting investment strategies. Monitoring these trends is essential for understanding broader market sentiment. 3.3 Liquidity and Trading Volume Large outflows from ETFs can affect the liquidity and trading volume of Ethereum on secondary markets. Lower liquidity can lead to increased price volatility and wider bid-ask spreads, impacting traders and investors alike. 4. Future Outlook for Ethereum ETFs 4.1 Potential for Recovery and Growth Despite the recent outflows, Ethereum ETFs may experience recovery as market conditions stabilize and investor confidence is restored. Continued innovation and the introduction of new ETF products could attract fresh investments. 4.2 Regulatory Clarity and Market Stability Enhanced regulatory clarity and stable economic conditions can bolster investor confidence, potentially reversing the current trend of outflows. Clear guidelines and supportive policies are crucial for the sustainable growth of Ethereum ETFs. 4.3 Diversification and Risk Management Investors may seek diversification within their portfolios, balancing their exposure between different cryptocurrencies and traditional assets. Effective risk management strategies can mitigate the impact of market volatility on ETF investments. 5. Expert Opinions and Analyst Insights 5.1 Market Analysts’ Perspectives Market analysts suggest that the net outflows from U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs are a reflection of broader market dynamics rather than isolated events. Factors such as macroeconomic trends, regulatory developments, and investor behavior play pivotal roles in shaping ETF performance. 5.2 Strategies for Investors Experts recommend that investors maintain a diversified portfolio, stay informed about market trends, and adopt a long-term perspective when investing in volatile assets like Ethereum. Understanding the underlying factors driving ETF movements can aid in making informed investment decisions. Conclusion The $55.5 million net outflow from U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs on December 30, 2024 , underscores the dynamic and multifaceted nature of cryptocurrency investments. Led by significant withdrawals from Fidelity’s FETH and Grayscale’s ETHE and ETH, these movements highlight the interplay between market volatility, regulatory developments, and investor strategies. For investors and market participants, staying attuned to these trends and understanding their implications is essential for navigating the ever-evolving crypto landscape.

38344819,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=116533,1735649460,"Analysis: Bitcoin (BTC) Yet to Enter a Bear Run, RSI Indicates Potential Stability","As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, investors and traders closely monitor technical indicators to gauge the market’s direction. One such crucial metric is the Relative Strength Index (RSI) , which helps identify overbought or oversold conditions. In a recent update on X (formerly Twitter) , renowned crypto analyst and trader Ali Martinez highlighted that Bitcoin (BTC) has yet to enter a bear run. With the RSI currently standing at 75 , this analysis suggests that Bitcoin maintains a degree of strength, potentially averting an imminent downturn. This article delves into the significance of BTC’s RSI, the factors influencing its current position, and the broader implications for investors. 1. Understanding the Relative Strength Index (RSI) 1.1 What is RSI? The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. Operating on a scale of 0 to 100 , RSI is used to identify overbought or oversold conditions in a market. RSI Below 30 : Indicates an oversold condition, suggesting a potential buying opportunity. RSI Above 70 : Signals an overbought condition, hinting at a possible price correction. RSI Above 90 : Often precedes a bear market, as it reflects extreme overbought conditions. 1.2 RSI as a Predictor of Market Trends RSI is a widely respected tool among traders for its ability to provide early signals of potential market reversals. Historically, bear markets in Bitcoin have been associated with RSI levels surpassing 90 , marking extreme overbought conditions that often lead to significant price declines. 2. Current RSI Status of Bitcoin 2.1 RSI at 75: What Does It Mean? Currently, Bitcoin’s RSI stands at 75 , which places it firmly in the overbought territory but below the critical 92 level that, according to Martinez, has historically signaled the onset of bear markets. This suggests that while Bitcoin is experiencing strong buying momentum, it has not yet reached the threshold typically associated with a market downturn. 2.2 Historical Context Looking back at Bitcoin’s price history: Previous Bear Runs : All past bear markets began when BTC’s RSI touched 92 . Current Stability : With an RSI of 75 , Bitcoin shows robust strength without the immediate signs of an impending sell-off. 3. Factors Contributing to Bitcoin’s Current RSI 3.1 Market Sentiment Positive market sentiment, driven by institutional adoption, favorable regulatory developments, and increasing mainstream acceptance, has contributed to Bitcoin’s elevated RSI. Confidence among investors often translates into sustained buying activity, keeping the RSI high. 3.2 Technical Developments Advancements in Bitcoin’s infrastructure, such as the implementation of the Lightning Network and improvements in scalability, have bolstered investor confidence, further supporting price stability and a higher RSI. 3.3 Macroeconomic Influences Global economic conditions, including low interest rates, inflation concerns, and geopolitical tensions, have driven investors toward Bitcoin as a hedge, sustaining its demand and supporting the RSI. 4. Implications for Investors 4.1 Bullish Outlook An RSI of 75 indicates that Bitcoin remains in a strong bullish phase. Investors may interpret this as a sign of continued upward momentum, potentially capitalizing on further price gains before any significant correction. 4.2 Caution Against Overextension While the RSI suggests strength, it is crucial for investors to remain vigilant. Markets can be unpredictable, and external factors can rapidly alter the landscape. Diversification and risk management strategies remain essential. 4.3 Long-Term Strategy For long-term holders, the current RSI position reinforces the viability of Bitcoin as a resilient asset. Continued adoption and technological advancements are likely to support Bitcoin’s growth trajectory. 5. Future Outlook 5.1 Potential for Further Gains If Bitcoin’s RSI continues to climb without reaching the critical 92 threshold, it may signal sustained bullish momentum. This scenario could attract more investors, further driving demand and price appreciation. 5.2 Monitoring Key Indicators Traders and investors should continue to monitor not only RSI but also other technical indicators such as moving averages, MACD, and trading volumes to gain a comprehensive understanding of market dynamics. 5.3 Regulatory Landscape Ongoing regulatory developments will play a significant role in shaping Bitcoin’s future. Positive regulatory news can bolster investor confidence, while restrictive measures may pose challenges. 6. Expert Opinions 6.1 Ali Martinez’s Perspective Crypto analyst Ali Martinez emphasizes that Bitcoin has yet to reach the RSI level associated with bear markets. He suggests that the current RSI indicates a period of relative strength, with the potential for continued upward movement unless significant market disruptions occur. 6.2 Industry Consensus While opinions vary, there is a general consensus that Bitcoin’s RSI is a valuable tool for assessing market conditions. Most experts agree that an RSI below 90 does not necessarily predict a bear run but rather signifies strong momentum that could sustain Bitcoin’s price. Conclusion Bitcoin’s current RSI of 75 suggests that the cryptocurrency remains in a strong bullish phase, with no immediate signs of entering a bear run as per Ali Martinez’s analysis. While the RSI indicates robust market strength, investors should remain cautious and consider a holistic approach by analyzing multiple indicators and staying informed about global economic and regulatory developments. As Bitcoin continues to solidify its position in the financial landscape, understanding and interpreting technical metrics like RSI will be crucial for making informed investment decisions.

With over $844,000 raised to date, Remittix is gathering steam and pioneering a new era in crypto payments. Remittix: Revolutionizing Cross-Border Payments with Blockchain Technology The cross-border payment market is booming, with projections reaching $250 trillion by 2027. Remittix (RTX) is poised to capitalize on this trend by providing a faster, less expensive, and more effective alternative to conventional cash transfer options. Remittix is powered by blockchain and offers private users and businesses international payments at a competitive price. Addressing the pain points of expensive fees and slow processing times will transform global money transfers and spark a financial revolution.

This enables access to a broader customer base and also allows companies to flourish in the growing digital world. The $RTX token presale has gained huge interest from investors across the market as it gears up to fly past $1 million before 2025. Today RTX tokens are available at $0.0167 but will be rising to $0.0172 so grab them before the price rises! Arbitrum’s Recovery Hopes Rise Amid Growing TVL and Token Unlock Arbitrum bulls are making an effort to regain control, with ARB showing modest gains of 2.74% daily and 2% over the past week. But the larger picture reflects recent dips. Arbitrum fell 18% in the last month and 2% over the previous six weeks. Despite these setbacks, Arbitrum’s Total Value Locked (TVL) is climbing. The network revealed it had crossed $20 billion in TVL earlier this month, and the figures keep mounting toward a new record. Arbitrum will release 92,650,000 ARB tokens on January 16th, which constitutes about 2.2% of its circulating supply. Although token unlocks often lead to price decreases, Arbitrum holders remain optimistic about ARB’s price prospects. Currently trading at $0.7614, Arbitrum remains $1.7 below its all-time high (ATH). Analysts are optimistic, with predictions suggesting ARB could hit $1 by January 2025 and retest its ATH by March. Kaspa Struggles Short-Term but Holds Long-Term Promise Kaspa’s recent developments, including its November Kraken listing and December TN11 Hard Fork Upgrade, haven’t delivered the price surge many anticipated. Bears continue to dominate, with Kaspa posting losses across weekly, monthly, and 6-month charts. Kaspa’s daily trading volume also fell by 12.08% to $81.6 million. Kaspa is now trading for $0.1166, and its price has declined by 3% during the last twenty-four hours. However, Kaspa’s long-term performance tells a different story. With gains exceeding 62,000% since its inception, many believe the bulls will reclaim control. Analysts remain optimistic, predicting a rebound to Kaspa’s all-time high of $0.22 and potentially hitting $1 by late 2025. While short-term performance has been underwhelming, Kaspa’s strong foundation and historical growth leave room for a promising future. Investors are keeping a close eye on its next moves. Why Remittix’s Growth Potentials to Investors Remittix’s growth potential has drawn many short—and long-term investors to the project. At press time, over 53 million tokens had been sold, raising $844,000 so far, with the $1M mark within sight. Plans to list $RTX on top exchanges will boost accessibility and liquidity, driving adoption further, with thousands of investors looking to join the presale in Q1.

38344818,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=116536,1735649409,"U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Experience $415.1 Million Net Outflows on December 30, 2024","On December 30, 2024 , U.S. spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) reported a combined net outflow of $415.1 million , as per data shared by Trader T on X (formerly Twitter). This significant withdrawal activity was predominantly led by major ETF providers, including Fidelity’s FBTC and Grayscale’s GBTC . Understanding the underlying factors driving these outflows and their potential implications on the broader cryptocurrency market is essential for investors and stakeholders navigating the evolving landscape of digital asset investments. 1. Breakdown of Net Outflows 1.1 Fidelity’s FBTC Leading the Outflow Fidelity’s FBTC experienced the largest net outflow, withdrawing $154.64 million from its spot Bitcoin ETF. As one of the most prominent players in the ETF market, Fidelity’s substantial outflow indicates a significant shift in investor sentiment or strategic reallocation of assets within their portfolio. 1.2 Grayscale’s GBTC Following Suit Grayscale’s GBTC reported a net outflow of $134.5 million , making it the second-largest contributor to the overall decline. Grayscale, known for its extensive range of crypto investment products, saw considerable investor movement away from its Bitcoin ETF, which may reflect broader market dynamics affecting large-cap crypto investments. 1.3 Other Significant Withdrawals BlackRock’s IBIT : $36.46 million outflow Grayscale’s Mini BTC : $31.73 million outflow Bitwise’s BITB : $31.37 million outflow ARK Invest’s ARKB : $26.4 million outflow These additional outflows, though smaller in comparison to Fidelity and Grayscale, collectively contribute to the substantial net outflow observed across U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs. 1.4 Stability in Other ETFs The remaining U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs reported negligible changes in their holdings on December 30, 2024, suggesting a consolidation of investor positions within these funds or a lack of significant market-moving events affecting their performance. 2. Factors Influencing the Net Outflows 2.1 Market Volatility and Bitcoin’s Price Fluctuations Cryptocurrency markets are inherently volatile, and Bitcoin is often at the center of significant price movements. Fluctuations in Bitcoin’s price can lead investors to withdraw funds from ETFs to manage risk, capitalize on price swings, or reallocate assets to other investment vehicles perceived as more stable or promising. 2.2 Macro-Economic Indicators Global economic conditions, including changes in interest rates, inflation rates, and geopolitical tensions, can impact investor confidence and influence the movement of funds in and out of Bitcoin ETFs. Economic uncertainty may drive investors to seek safer assets, resulting in withdrawals from more volatile investment products like Bitcoin ETFs. 2.3 Regulatory Developments Ongoing regulatory scrutiny and potential changes in cryptocurrency regulations can affect investor sentiment. News of stricter regulations, tax implications, or bans on crypto activities may prompt investors to reduce their exposure to Bitcoin ETFs in anticipation of future restrictions or market impacts. 2.4 Profit-Taking and Portfolio Rebalancing Investors may engage in profit-taking after significant gains, withdrawing funds from ETFs to realize returns or rebalance their portfolios to maintain desired asset allocations. This strategic movement can lead to substantial outflows from ETFs, especially those that have performed well over a certain period. 2.5 Institutional Investment Strategies Changes in institutional investment strategies, such as shifts in asset allocation or the introduction of new investment products, can also drive significant fund movements. Institutions may move capital between different types of ETFs or alternative investment vehicles based on evolving market outlooks and investment priorities. 3. Implications for the Bitcoin Market 3.1 Impact on Bitcoin’s Price While ETF outflows can exert downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price, the direct correlation between ETF movements and Bitcoin’s market price is complex. Other factors, including direct trading on exchanges, institutional investments, and macroeconomic trends, also play significant roles in determining Bitcoin’s price trajectory. 3.2 Investor Sentiment and Market Confidence Significant outflows from major ETFs like Fidelity’s FBTC and Grayscale’s GBTC may indicate shifting investor sentiment or concerns about Bitcoin’s short-term prospects. Such movements can influence broader market confidence, potentially leading to increased volatility as investors reassess their positions. 3.3 Liquidity and Trading Volume Large outflows from ETFs can impact the liquidity and trading volume of Bitcoin on secondary markets. Lower liquidity can lead to increased price volatility and wider bid-ask spreads, affecting traders and investors alike by making it more challenging to execute large orders without affecting the market price significantly. 4. Future Outlook for Bitcoin ETFs 4.1 Potential for Recovery and Growth Despite the recent outflows, Bitcoin ETFs may experience recovery as market conditions stabilize and investor confidence is restored. Continued innovation in ETF products, improved regulatory clarity, and sustained interest in Bitcoin as a digital asset could attract new investments and reverse the current trend of withdrawals. 4.2 Regulatory Clarity and Market Stability Enhanced regulatory clarity and supportive policies can bolster investor confidence, potentially reversing the current trend of ETF outflows. Clear guidelines and a stable regulatory environment are crucial for the sustainable growth of Bitcoin ETFs, encouraging more institutional and retail participation. 4.3 Diversification and Risk Management Investors may seek diversification within their portfolios, balancing their exposure between different cryptocurrencies and traditional assets. Effective risk management strategies, including diversification and hedging, can help mitigate the impact of market volatility on ETF investments, promoting more stable and long-term investment approaches. 5. Expert Opinions and Analyst Insights 5.1 Market Analysts’ Perspectives Market analysts suggest that the net outflows from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs are reflective of broader market dynamics rather than isolated events. Factors such as macroeconomic trends, regulatory developments, and shifts in investor behavior are pivotal in shaping ETF performance and can provide context for understanding the outflows. 5.2 Strategies for Investors Experts recommend that investors maintain a diversified portfolio, stay informed about market trends, and adopt a long-term perspective when investing in volatile assets like Bitcoin. Understanding the underlying factors driving ETF movements can aid in making informed investment decisions and managing portfolio risk effectively. Conclusion The $415.1 million net outflow from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs on December 30, 2024 , highlights the dynamic and multifaceted nature of cryptocurrency investments. Led by significant withdrawals from Fidelity’s FBTC and Grayscale’s GBTC , these outflows reflect a combination of market volatility, macroeconomic influences, regulatory developments, and strategic investment decisions by institutional investors. For investors and market participants, staying attuned to these trends and understanding their implications is essential for navigating the ever-evolving crypto landscape. As the Bitcoin market continues to mature, the performance and strategies of ETFs will remain critical indicators of broader market health and investor confidence.

This statement was made during an interview with CNBC , as reported by Cointelegraph on X (formerly Twitter). Wood’s predictions underscore her firm’s bullish stance on Bitcoin and reflect broader trends in institutional investment and cryptocurrency adoption. 1. Cathie Wood’s Bitcoin Forecast 1.1 Base Case Scenario: $600K by 2030 Cathie Wood outlined her base case scenario , where Bitcoin is expected to attain a valuation of $600,000 by 2030 . This projection is grounded in several key factors, including: Increased Institutional Adoption : More financial institutions and large corporations integrating Bitcoin into their portfolios. Scarcity and Halving Events : Bitcoin’s limited supply and the halving of mining rewards, which reduce the rate of new BTC entering circulation. Technological Advancements : Improvements in blockchain technology and scaling solutions that enhance Bitcoin’s utility and efficiency. 1.2 Bull Market Scenario: $1.5M In an even more optimistic bull market scenario , Cathie Wood envisions Bitcoin reaching $1.5 million .

Widespread Retail Adoption : Increased use of Bitcoin in everyday transactions and as a store of value by the general public. Regulatory Clarity : Favorable regulatory developments that legitimize and facilitate Bitcoin’s integration into the financial system. 2.

The firm’s increasing allocations to Bitcoin ETFs and other institutional investment vehicles demonstrate growing confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term prospects. 2.2 Macro-Economic Trends Global economic trends, including rising inflation and currency devaluation, are driving investors to seek alternatives like Bitcoin. As traditional fiat currencies face potential instability, Bitcoin’s decentralized nature offers a resilient store of value. 2.3 Technological Innovations Advancements in Bitcoin’s underlying technology, such as the Lightning Network and enhanced security protocols, are making transactions faster, cheaper, and more secure. These improvements bolster Bitcoin’s utility and appeal to both retail and institutional investors. 3.

Her reputation as a forward-thinking investment strategist lends credibility to her predictions, encouraging more investors to consider Bitcoin as a viable long-term asset. 3.2 Impact on Bitcoin’s Price Following Wood’s announcement, Bitcoin has seen an uptick in trading volume and price appreciation. Investors are responding to the optimistic forecast by increasing their positions in Bitcoin, anticipating future gains. 3.3 Comparison with Previous Predictions Wood’s predictions are more aggressive compared to earlier forecasts. While some analysts have projected Bitcoin reaching $500K by 2030, her estimates of $600K and potentially $1.5M in a bull market reflect an even more optimistic outlook. 4. Implications for Investors 4.1 Long-Term Investment Strategy Wood’s forecast encourages investors to adopt a long-term investment strategy with Bitcoin. By positioning Bitcoin as a significant component of a diversified portfolio, investors can potentially benefit from its substantial growth over the coming decade. 4.2 Risk Management Despite the optimistic projections, investors should remain mindful of Bitcoin’s volatility and inherent risks. Diversifying investments and employing risk management strategies are essential to mitigate potential downturns in the cryptocurrency market. 4.3 Institutional Participation Increased institutional participation can lead to greater market stability and liquidity for Bitcoin. As more large-scale investors enter the market, Bitcoin may experience reduced volatility and more predictable growth patterns. 5. Expert Opinions and Analyst Insights 5.1 Supportive Views Several crypto analysts and industry experts echo Wood’s bullish sentiments, citing factors such as growing institutional adoption, technological advancements, and macroeconomic trends that support Bitcoin’s long-term growth potential. 5.2 Skeptical Perspectives Conversely, some experts caution against overly optimistic projections, highlighting regulatory uncertainties, potential market saturation, and the possibility of technological challenges that could impede Bitcoin’s growth. 5.3 Balanced Approaches A balanced perspective suggests that while Bitcoin holds significant growth potential, investors should remain cautious and consider a diversified approach to capitalize on opportunities while managing risks. 6. Future Outlook for Bitcoin 6.1 Continued Institutional Integration The trend of institutional integration is likely to continue, with more financial institutions incorporating Bitcoin into their investment products and services. This ongoing integration will play a crucial role in driving Bitcoin’s adoption and price appreciation. 6.2 Regulatory Developments Future regulatory developments will significantly impact Bitcoin’s trajectory. Clear and supportive regulations can facilitate wider adoption, while restrictive measures may pose challenges to Bitcoin’s growth. 6.3 Technological Evolution Ongoing technological advancements will enhance Bitcoin’s functionality and scalability, making it more attractive to a broader range of users and investors. Innovations such as layer-2 solutions and improved security measures will be pivotal in sustaining Bitcoin’s growth momentum. Conclusion Cathie Wood’s ambitious prediction that Bitcoin could reach $600,000 by 2030 and $1.5 million in a bull market scenario underscores the significant growth potential she sees in the flagship cryptocurrency. Supported by factors such as increasing institutional adoption, favorable macroeconomic trends, and continuous technological advancements, Bitcoin appears poised for substantial appreciation over the next decade.

38344761,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=116545,1735649294,San Francisco Fed President Advocates for Recognizing Crypto as a Separate Asset Class,"In a significant commentary on the evolving financial landscape, Mary Daly , President of the San Francisco Federal Reserve (Fed) , emphasized the necessity of classifying cryptocurrencies as a distinct asset class rather than grouping them alongside traditional assets like gold. Speaking during an interview on Yahoo Finance’s Opening Bid podcast , Daly highlighted the multifaceted nature of cryptocurrencies, advocating for a clear and separate definition to better understand and regulate this burgeoning sector. This perspective offers valuable insights into how major financial institutions perceive the role and classification of digital assets within the broader economy. 1. Mary Daly’s Perspective on Cryptocurrencies 1.1 Cryptocurrencies as a Complex Asset Mary Daly remarked, “I see crypto as a complicated thing,” underscoring the intricate and multifaceted characteristics that differentiate cryptocurrencies from other traditional assets. Unlike gold, which primarily serves as a store of value, cryptocurrencies exhibit functionalities that span multiple financial roles. 1.2 Distinct Functionalities of Cryptocurrencies Daly elaborated that cryptocurrencies can function as: Currency : Serving as a medium of exchange for goods and services. Medium of Exchange : Facilitating transactions between parties without the need for intermediaries. Stock : Representing ownership in a decentralized network or platform. These varied functionalities necessitate a distinct classification to address the unique challenges and opportunities they present. 2. Comparison with Traditional Assets 2.1 Cryptocurrencies vs. Gold While both cryptocurrencies and gold share some similarities, such as being used as investment vehicles, their core differences warrant separate classifications: Utility : Gold is primarily a store of value, whereas cryptocurrencies offer multiple utilities including transactional capabilities and governance mechanisms. Volatility : Cryptocurrencies exhibit higher volatility compared to gold, influencing their risk profiles and investment strategies.

Large financial institutions and corporate entities continue to allocate substantial portions of their portfolios to Bitcoin, viewing it as a hedge against inflation and a store of value. 4.2 Regulatory Developments Positive regulatory developments and clearer guidelines surrounding Bitcoin have enhanced its legitimacy and appeal. Regulatory support can drive investor confidence, contributing to sustained interest and investment in BTC. 4.3 Technological Advancements Ongoing technological advancements in Bitcoin’s ecosystem, such as improvements in scalability, security, and the development of the Lightning Network, have bolstered its utility and attractiveness to a broader range of users and investors. 5. Implications for Altcoins 5.1 Investment Strategies During a Bitcoin Season, investors may adopt more conservative strategies, favoring the stability of Bitcoin over the higher volatility of altcoins. This shift can lead to reduced investment in altcoins, affecting their price performance and market capitalization. 5.2 Development and Innovation Despite lower investment flows, development and innovation within the altcoin space continue unabated. Projects focusing on unique use cases, technological improvements, and strategic partnerships aim to enhance their value proposition and prepare for future Altcoin Seasons. 5.3 Market Opportunities Altcoins may present opportunities for strategic investments, particularly in projects with strong fundamentals and potential for growth. Investors may look for undervalued altcoins that can outperform in future market conditions. 6. Future Outlook 6.1 Potential for Altcoin Season The Altcoin Season Index will continue to be a vital indicator for market trends. A rise in the index score above 75 would signify a shift towards an Altcoin Season, prompting increased interest and investment in altcoins. 6.2 Monitoring Key Indicators Investors should monitor key indicators such as the Altcoin Season Index, Bitcoin dominance, trading volumes, and macroeconomic factors to make informed decisions. Staying attuned to market signals can help in anticipating shifts between Bitcoin and Altcoin Seasons. 6.3 Long-Term Market Dynamics The long-term dynamics of the cryptocurrency market suggest a cyclical pattern of dominance between Bitcoin and altcoins.

38344663,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=116560,1735649131,Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Could Drop to $85K as Tether Dominance Rises,"In a recent market analysis, crypto analyst Justin Bennett has issued a cautionary forecast regarding Bitcoin (BTC) . Bennett predicts that Bitcoin’s price could decline to $85,000 if the dominance of Tether (USDT) , measured by the USDT.D index, increases to the 4.7-5% range. This projection, highlighted by The Daily Hodl , underscores the intricate relationship between Bitcoin’s market performance and the stability of tethered stablecoins like Tether. Understanding Bennett’s analysis provides valuable insights into potential market movements and investor strategies in the evolving cryptocurrency landscape. 1. Justin Bennett’s Bitcoin Price Prediction 1.1 The $85K Target Justin Bennett has articulated a bearish outlook for Bitcoin, suggesting that the cryptocurrency could depreciate to $85,000 under specific market conditions. This target is contingent upon the rising dominance of Tether (USDT) within the broader crypto market, signaling a potential shift in liquidity and investor preferences. 1.2 Conditions for the Price Drop Bennett’s prediction is primarily based on the increasing dominance of Tether (USDT) . He observes that as USDT.D climbs towards the 4.7-5% threshold, it may exert downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price. This scenario is indicative of a market bottom, where the stabilization or decline in Bitcoin’s dominance could lead to significant price corrections. 2. Tether Dominance Metrics 2.1 Understanding USDT.D The USDT.D index measures the dominance of Tether (USDT) relative to Bitcoin in the cryptocurrency market. An upward trend in USDT.D indicates that a larger share of trading volume and liquidity is being channeled through Tether, potentially impacting Bitcoin’s market dynamics. 2.2 Current Trends and Indicators According to Bennett, USDT.D has been exhibiting an upward trend, with a recent weekly close above 4.29% . This increase suggests growing reliance on Tether as a stablecoin, which could influence Bitcoin’s liquidity and trading behavior. Bennett anticipates that USDT.D will continue to rise in the coming weeks, setting the stage for the predicted Bitcoin price drop. 3. Implications for the Cryptocurrency Market 3.1 Impact on Bitcoin’s Price A rise in Tether’s dominance can lead to reduced liquidity for Bitcoin, as more capital is held in stablecoins rather than being actively invested in Bitcoin. This shift may result in downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price, aligning with Bennett’s forecast of a potential drop to $85K . 3.2 Market Sentiment and Investor Behavior An increase in Tether dominance often reflects a more cautious market sentiment, where investors prefer the relative stability of USDT over the volatility of Bitcoin. This behavior can signal a defensive stance, anticipating potential downturns or seeking to preserve capital amidst market uncertainties. 3.3 Liquidity and Trading Volume Higher Tether dominance can lead to a consolidation of liquidity within stablecoins, potentially reducing the overall trading volume for Bitcoin. This contraction in liquidity may contribute to greater price volatility and sharper corrections, as Bennett suggests. 4. Expert Opinions and Analyst Insights 4.1 Supportive Views Several market analysts echo Bennett’s concerns, highlighting the critical role of stablecoins in influencing Bitcoin’s price dynamics. The increased adoption of Tether as a liquidity provider can reshape market structures, leading to significant price movements for major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. 4.2 Contrasting Perspectives Conversely, some experts argue that Bitcoin’s resilience and institutional support can mitigate the impact of rising stablecoin dominance. They suggest that Bitcoin’s unique value proposition and growing acceptance as a digital store of value may sustain its price despite fluctuations in stablecoin metrics. 4.3 Balanced Approaches A balanced viewpoint emphasizes the importance of monitoring both Bitcoin and stablecoin indicators. Investors are encouraged to diversify their portfolios and consider the interplay between different asset classes to navigate potential market shifts effectively. 5. Future Outlook and Developments 5.1 Potential for Market Recovery While Bennett’s prediction is bearish, the cryptocurrency market is known for its cyclical nature. A decline to $85K could be followed by a recovery phase, driven by renewed investor interest, technological advancements, and favorable regulatory developments. 5.2 Regulatory Impact Regulatory changes surrounding stablecoins and cryptocurrencies can significantly influence market dynamics. Clearer regulations could either bolster market confidence or impose constraints that affect the adoption and stability of digital assets like Tether and Bitcoin. 5.3 Technological Innovations Continued advancements in blockchain technology and the integration of decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions can enhance Bitcoin’s utility and appeal. Innovations such as scalability improvements, enhanced security measures, and interoperability with other blockchain networks may support Bitcoin’s long-term growth. Conclusion Justin Bennett’s forecast that Bitcoin (BTC) could decline to $85,000 if Tether’s (USDT) dominance rises to the 4.7-5% range highlights the delicate balance between major cryptocurrencies and stablecoins within the market. While the increase in USDT.D signals a potential market bottom, the interplay between investor sentiment, liquidity, and regulatory factors will continue to shape Bitcoin’s trajectory. For investors and market participants, understanding the dynamics between Bitcoin and stablecoins is essential for making informed decisions. Diversifying portfolios, staying attuned to market indicators like the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, and monitoring regulatory developments can help navigate the complexities of the cryptocurrency market. As the digital asset ecosystem evolves, the relationship between Bitcoin and stablecoins like Tether will remain a critical factor in determining market movements and investment strategies.

38344675,https://nulltx.com/?p=137345,1735649103,"ETHEREUM PRICE ANALYSIS & PREDICTION (December 31) – ETH Continues To Lose Momentum After Facing Rejection, Big Storm Around The Corner?","Ethereum advanced bullishly this week and broke out to a new yearly high. However, it saw a rejection and failed to sustain bullish momentum. The price slipped and now looks weak on the daily timeframe. Following a quick recovery above the $2100 level in the mid-month, Ethereum’s price increased and flipped the peak of $2403 to mark a new one at precisely the $2,445 level this week. Immediately after testing that price level, it saw a rejection and quickly rolled back below the $2,400 level with a bearish candle close on the daily chart. The price further dipped to a weekly low of $2,257 before recovering to where it currently trades at around $2,281. The extremely drop in volume in the past days brought trading from little-to-no volatility in the past hours. As we can see on the daily chart, ETH looks indecisive with no major price movements since the piece fell to $2,278 yesterday However, it is essential to note that the second-largest crypto by market cap has entered a consolidation phase from a short-term perspective. Though there’s hope for more bullish if the buying volume increase from a long-term perspective. But if the price dips in the next few days with a crack below the current monthly low, we may see a small price correction before resuming bullish at full speed. As of now, the trend remains bullish on the daily chart. ETH’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview A push from the current trading level could send the price back to the $2,300 and $2,403 resistance levels before breaking higher. If the price dips, the immediate support level to watch for test would be $2257, followed by $2179. A drop below this level would confirm a fresh breakdown. The levels to pay attention to are $2,116 and perhaps $2,003. Key Resistance Levels: $2,330, $2,403, $2,445 Key Support Levels: $2,257, $2,179, $2,116 Spot Price: $2,281 Trend: Bullish Volatility: High Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

38344662,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=116563,1735649094,Compromised Private Keys Remain the Leading Cause of Crypto Losses in 2024,"In the rapidly evolving landscape of cryptocurrencies , security remains a paramount concern for investors and stakeholders alike. According to a recent report by Unfolded , a cryptocurrency market insight platform, compromised private keys have emerged as the leading cause of cryptocurrency thefts in 2024 , accounting for 43.8% of the total losses from January to November this year. This statistic underscores the critical importance of safeguarding private keys to protect digital assets from unauthorized access and theft. This article delves into the factors contributing to the prevalence of compromised private keys, the implications for the crypto market, and effective strategies to enhance security measures. 1. Overview of Crypto Losses in 2024 1.1 Report by Unfolded Unfolded has highlighted the primary causes of cryptocurrency losses over the past eleven months, categorizing the incidents as follows: Compromised Private Keys: 43.8% Unknown Causes: 25.3% Exploits: 8.5% Security Vulnerabilities: 6.3% The report emphasizes that compromised private keys are the most significant threat to crypto security, surpassing other causes by a substantial margin. 1.2 Data Collection and Analysis Unfolded’s analysis is based on comprehensive data gathered from various sources within the cryptocurrency ecosystem, including exchanges, wallets, and blockchain monitoring tools. The platform employs advanced algorithms to identify and categorize instances of crypto loss, providing a clear picture of the prevailing security challenges. 2.

Insecure Storage: Storing private keys in unsecured environments, such as online storage or unencrypted files. 2.3 Case Studies of Compromised Private Keys Several high-profile incidents in 2024 have underscored the vulnerability of private keys: Exchange Hacks: Major cryptocurrency exchanges have fallen victim to breaches where attackers gained access to private keys, leading to significant asset losses. Individual Wallet Thefts: Private individuals have experienced wallet thefts due to weak security practices, resulting in substantial financial losses. 3. Other Causes of Crypto Losses 3.1 Unknown Causes (25.3%) A significant portion of crypto losses remain unexplained, categorized under “unknown causes.” These incidents lack sufficient data for precise classification, highlighting the need for enhanced transparency and reporting within the industry. 3.2 Exploits (8.5%) Exploits involve the manipulation of smart contracts or vulnerabilities within blockchain protocols to siphon off funds. These technical breaches exploit flaws in the code, allowing attackers to redirect transactions or withdraw assets without authorization. 3.3 Security Vulnerabilities (6.3%) Security vulnerabilities pertain to weaknesses in the infrastructure of cryptocurrency platforms, including exchanges and wallet services. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by malicious actors to gain unauthorized access to funds. 4. Implications for the Cryptocurrency Market 4.1 Erosion of Trust The high incidence of crypto losses due to compromised private keys can erode investor trust in the cryptocurrency market. Trust is fundamental for market stability and growth, and persistent security breaches can deter new and existing investors. 4.2 Regulatory Scrutiny Increasing crypto thefts may prompt regulatory bodies to impose stricter security standards and compliance requirements on cryptocurrency platforms. Enhanced regulations aim to protect investors but may also introduce operational challenges for businesses in the crypto space. 4.3 Impact on Market Dynamics Frequent security breaches can lead to increased volatility in cryptocurrency prices, as negative sentiment may drive rapid sell-offs. Additionally, security concerns can influence the adoption rates of various cryptocurrencies and related technologies. 5. Strategies to Mitigate Compromised Private Keys 5.1 Enhanced Security Practices Implementing robust security measures is essential to protect private keys: Hardware Wallets: Storing private keys on hardware wallets, which are offline and less susceptible to hacking. Multi-Signature Wallets: Requiring multiple signatures to authorize transactions, adding an extra layer of security.

Future Outlook and Developments 6.1 Advancements in Security Technology The cryptocurrency industry is witnessing significant advancements in security technologies, aimed at mitigating the risks associated with compromised private keys: Decentralized Identity Solutions: Enhancing user authentication processes without relying on centralized entities. Blockchain-Based Security Protocols: Developing innovative security protocols that leverage blockchain’s inherent strengths to protect private keys. 6.2 Regulatory Frameworks Emerging regulatory frameworks will play a crucial role in shaping the future of crypto security: Standardization of Security Practices: Establishing standardized security protocols for cryptocurrency platforms. Compliance Requirements: Mandating adherence to stringent security measures to prevent private key compromises. 6.3 Increasing Institutional Involvement As institutional investors continue to enter the cryptocurrency market, the emphasis on security is expected to intensify: Institutional-Grade Security Solutions: Developing security solutions tailored to the needs of institutional investors, ensuring the protection of large-scale assets. Collaboration with Security Firms: Partnering with leading security firms to enhance the robustness of crypto platforms. Conclusion The 2024 report by Unfolded reveals that compromised private keys are the leading cause of cryptocurrency losses, accounting for 43.8% of total thefts from January to November. This alarming statistic highlights the urgent need for improved security measures and user education to protect digital assets effectively. As the cryptocurrency market continues to mature, addressing the vulnerabilities associated with private keys will be pivotal in fostering trust, ensuring market stability, and driving broader adoption. Investors, developers, and platform providers must prioritize security to mitigate the risks of private key compromises.

38344627,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=116570,1735649036,What is Forex? A Comprehensive Guide to Understanding Forex Trading,"In the vast and dynamic world of financial markets, Forex , short for Foreign Exchange , stands out as the largest and most liquid market globally. Whether you’re a seasoned trader or a curious newcomer, understanding Forex is essential for navigating the complexities of currency trading. This comprehensive guide delves into the fundamental aspects of Forex, elucidating key terms and concepts that are crucial for anyone looking to engage in this lucrative market. What is Forex? Forex , also known as FX or Foreign Exchange , refers to the global marketplace for trading national currencies against one another. Unlike other financial markets, Forex operates 24 hours a day, five days a week, facilitating continuous trading across different time zones. The primary purpose of the Forex market is to enable international trade and investment by allowing businesses and individuals to convert one currency into another. Meaning of Forex The term Forex is derived from the combination of “foreign” and “exchange,” highlighting its core function of exchanging one foreign currency for another. For example, exchanging U.S. dollars (USD) for euros (EUR) or Japanese yen (JPY) for British pounds (GBP). Importance of Forex Forex plays a pivotal role in the global economy by: Facilitating international trade and investment. Enabling currency conversion for travelers and businesses. Allowing speculation and investment opportunities for traders. Influencing economic indicators like inflation and interest rates. Key Forex Terms and Concepts To effectively participate in the Forex market, it’s essential to grasp several key terms and concepts. This section breaks down some of the most fundamental aspects of Forex trading. What is a Lot in Forex? A lot is the standard unit of measurement for the size of a Forex trade. There are three main types of lots: Standard Lot: Represents 100,000 units of the base currency. Mini Lot: Represents 10,000 units of the base currency. Micro Lot: Represents 1,000 units of the base currency. Understanding lot sizes is crucial as it determines the potential profit or loss in a trade. Larger lot sizes can lead to higher gains but also increase the risk of significant losses. What is Leverage in Forex? Leverage allows traders to control larger positions with a relatively small amount of capital. It is expressed as a ratio, such as 50:1, 100:1, or 500:1. For instance, with 100:1 leverage, a trader can control a $100,000 position with just $1,000 of their own money. While leverage can amplify profits, it also magnifies losses, making it a double-edged sword. Proper risk management strategies are essential when using leverage to prevent substantial financial losses. What is Margin in Forex? Margin is the amount of money required to open and maintain a leveraged Forex position. It acts as a security deposit to cover potential losses. Margin is typically expressed as a percentage of the total trade size. For example, with 100:1 leverage, the margin requirement for a standard lot (100,000 units) would be 1%, or $1,000. Understanding margin is vital to ensure that traders do not overextend their positions, which can lead to margin calls or forced liquidations if the market moves against them. What is Spread in Forex? The spread is the difference between the bid price (the price at which traders can sell a currency pair) and the ask price (the price at which traders can buy a currency pair). It is essentially the broker’s fee for facilitating the trade. Tight Spreads: Indicate lower transaction costs and are typically found in major currency pairs. Wide Spreads: Result in higher transaction costs and are common in exotic currency pairs. Minimizing spreads is beneficial for traders as it reduces the cost of entering and exiting trades. What is Liquidity in Forex? Liquidity refers to the ease with which a currency pair can be bought or sold in the market without affecting its price. High liquidity implies that there are many buyers and sellers, ensuring that trades can be executed quickly and at desired prices. Major currency pairs like EUR/USD, USD/JPY, and GBP/USD exhibit high liquidity, while exotic pairs have lower liquidity. High liquidity is advantageous for traders as it reduces the risk of price manipulation and ensures smoother market operations. What is US30 in Forex? US30 , also known as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) , is a stock market index that tracks 30 large, publicly-owned companies trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the Nasdaq. In Forex trading, US30 is often traded as a contract for difference (CFD) , allowing traders to speculate on its price movements without owning the underlying stocks. Trading indices like US30 provides diversification opportunities and exposure to broader market trends beyond individual currency pairs. What is NFP in Forex? NFP , or Non-Farm Payrolls , is a key economic indicator released monthly by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. It measures the number of jobs added or lost in the U.S. economy, excluding the farming sector. NFP is closely watched by Forex traders as it provides insights into the health of the U.S. economy and influences the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decisions. Strong NFP numbers can lead to a stronger USD, while weaker numbers may result in a weaker USD. What is a Buy Stop in Forex? A buy stop is a type of pending order used by traders to enter a long position when the price of a currency pair reaches a specified level above the current market price. It is often used to capitalize on upward momentum or to limit potential losses. For example, if EUR/USD is trading at 1.1000 and a trader places a buy stop at 1.1050, the order will be executed only if the price rises to 1.1050, indicating a breakout and potentially signaling further upward movement. What is Hedging in Forex? Hedging in Forex involves opening multiple positions to offset potential losses in the market. It is a risk management strategy used to protect against adverse price movements. For instance, a trader holding a long position on EUR/USD might open a short position on the same pair to mitigate potential losses if the market moves against their initial trade. While hedging can reduce risk, it can also limit potential profits, so it must be used judiciously. How Forex Trading Works Forex trading involves buying one currency while simultaneously selling another. Currencies are traded in pairs, such as EUR/USD, GBP/JPY, or USD/CHF. The first currency in the pair is the base currency , and the second is the quote currency . The goal is to predict whether the base currency will strengthen or weaken against the quote currency. Example of a Forex Trade EUR/USD Trading Pair: Base Currency: EUR Quote Currency: USD Current Price: 1.1000 (means 1 EUR = 1.1000 USD) Buying EUR/USD: You believe the EUR will strengthen against the USD. If EUR/USD rises to 1.1100, you can sell at a profit. Selling EUR/USD: You believe the EUR will weaken against the USD. If EUR/USD falls to 1.0900, you can buy back at a profit. Types of Forex Orders Market Order: Executes immediately at the current market price. Limit Order: Sets a specific price at which to buy or sell. Stop Order: Triggers a market order once a certain price level is reached. Buy Stop and Sell Stop Orders: Enter positions once the price crosses a predefined level. Understanding these order types allows traders to execute their strategies effectively, managing both entry and exit points in the market. Importance of Understanding Forex Concepts Grasping the fundamental concepts of Forex trading is essential for success in this market. Knowledge of terms like leverage, margin, and spreads can significantly impact trading decisions and risk management. Additionally, understanding market indicators like NFP and indices like US30 can provide deeper insights into market trends and potential trading opportunities. Conclusion Forex trading offers immense opportunities for profit, but it also comes with significant risks. By understanding the key concepts such as lots, leverage, margin, spreads, liquidity, buy stops, hedging, and market indicators like US30 and NFP, traders can navigate the Forex market with greater confidence and strategic insight. Whether you’re just starting or looking to refine your trading strategies, a solid foundation in Forex principles is indispensable. Embrace continuous learning, practice disciplined trading, and stay informed about global economic developments to enhance your Forex trading journey.

38344625,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=116567,1735649031,MicroStrategy Shares Plunge 45% from Peak Amid Market Shifts and Investor Uncertainty,"MicroStrategy Inc. (MSTR) , a prominent enterprise analytics and mobility platform, has experienced a significant downturn in its stock performance. On December 30, 2024 , MSTR shares plummeted nearly 45% from their November peak of $543 , settling just above $300 . This sharp decline encompasses a 30% drop following the company’s December 14 announcement of its inclusion in the Nasdaq-100 index. Despite this setback, MicroStrategy maintains impressive year-to-date gains of over 400% and has seen its stock price multiply 20-fold since initiating its Bitcoin investment strategy in 2020. This article delves into the factors contributing to the recent decline, the broader market implications, and investor perspectives on whether this represents a temporary pullback or a more profound trend reversal. 1. Overview of the Share Price Decline 1.1 Sharp Drop from Peak MicroStrategy’s stock has faced a notable decline, shedding nearly 45% from its November peak of $543 to just above $300 by the end of December 2024. This substantial drop underscores the volatility inherent in the cryptocurrency-linked investment strategies that the company has adopted. 1.2 Nasdaq-100 Inclusion Impact The December 14 inclusion of MicroStrategy in the Nasdaq-100 index has been a double-edged sword. While such inclusion typically signals strong market performance and recognition, it has also subjected MSTR shares to increased scrutiny and trading dynamics associated with index fund rebalancing. The immediate aftermath saw a 30% decline, reflecting the market’s complex reaction to this milestone. 2. Year-to-Date and Long-Term Performance 2.1 Impressive Year-to-Date Gains Despite the recent downturn, MicroStrategy’s shares remain up over 400% year-to-date. This remarkable performance is largely attributed to the company’s strategic investments in Bitcoin (BTC) , which have significantly boosted investor confidence and stock valuation. 2.2 20-Fold Increase Since 2020 Since 2020 , when MicroStrategy began its aggressive acquisition of Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset, the company’s stock price has surged 20-fold . This long-term bullish trend highlights the effectiveness of integrating cryptocurrency assets into corporate balance sheets, albeit with associated risks and volatility. 3. Market Shifts and Corporate Bitcoin Strategies 3.1 Founder Michael Saylor’s Aggressive Promotion Michael Saylor , CEO and co-founder of MicroStrategy, has been a vocal advocate for Bitcoin as a strategic asset. His relentless promotion of Bitcoin treasury strategies has positioned MicroStrategy as a pioneer among corporations in adopting digital assets for financial stability and growth. 3.2 Emergence of Similar Corporate Approaches MicroStrategy’s success has inspired other corporations to explore similar Bitcoin integration strategies. The trend reflects a broader market shift towards recognizing cryptocurrencies as viable investment vehicles, prompting a wave of institutional adoption that could reshape traditional financial paradigms. 4. Investor Sentiment and Theories on Market Cycles 4.1 Debate on Temporary Pullback vs. Trend Reversal The recent decline in MicroStrategy shares has sparked a debate among investors and analysts. Some view the 45% drop as a temporary pullback within a larger bullish framework, while others interpret it as an indicator of a potential trend reversal in the cryptocurrency-linked stock market. 4.2 George Soros’ Theory of Reflexivity Invoking George Soros’ Theory of Reflexivity , the situation exemplifies how investor perceptions can influence market fundamentals. According to Soros, markets are not always driven by objective reality but are instead influenced by the biases and actions of participants. In this case, the rapid sell-off in MicroStrategy shares may have been fueled by changing investor sentiment, which in turn affects the stock’s actual performance and valuation. 5. Implications for the Cryptocurrency Market 5.1 Influence on Bitcoin’s Perception MicroStrategy’s stock performance is closely tied to Bitcoin’s market behavior. A significant drop in MSTR shares could impact investor sentiment towards Bitcoin, potentially leading to broader market repercussions given the company’s prominent role in corporate Bitcoin adoption. 5.2 Impact on Corporate Investment Strategies The volatility experienced by MicroStrategy may prompt other corporations to reassess their cryptocurrency investment strategies. Balancing aggressive adoption with risk management will be crucial for sustaining long-term growth and stability in the volatile crypto market. 6. Future Outlook for MicroStrategy 6.1 Strategic Adjustments To navigate the current downturn, MicroStrategy may consider strategic adjustments, such as diversifying its asset portfolio, enhancing liquidity, or implementing more robust risk management practices to mitigate the impacts of cryptocurrency volatility. 6.2 Potential for Recovery Given MicroStrategy’s strong year-to-date performance and the long-term growth trajectory driven by its Bitcoin investments, there is potential for a recovery. Market stabilization and renewed investor confidence in both the company and Bitcoin could facilitate a rebound in MSTR shares. 6.3 Monitoring Market Trends Continuous monitoring of market trends, regulatory developments, and Bitcoin’s performance will be essential for MicroStrategy to adapt and thrive in the evolving financial landscape. Conclusion The 45% drop in MicroStrategy (MSTR) shares from their November peak reflects the complex interplay between corporate investment strategies, market dynamics, and investor sentiment. While the recent decline raises concerns about potential trend reversals, MicroStrategy’s impressive year-to-date gains and long-term growth driven by Bitcoin investments indicate resilience and continued potential. Investors remain divided on whether this downturn is a temporary setback or a precursor to broader market shifts, invoking theories like George Soros’ Reflexivity to explain the phenomena. As the cryptocurrency market continues to mature, the experiences of companies like MicroStrategy will provide valuable lessons on the benefits and risks of integrating digital assets into corporate financial strategies. Balancing aggressive investment with prudent risk management will be key to navigating the volatile yet promising landscape of cryptocurrency-linked investments.

38344573,https://nulltx.com/?p=137341,1735648891,"BITCOIN PRICE ANALYSIS & PREDICTION (December 31) – BTC Primes For Bigger Drops As It Forms H&S Pattern, Eyes $85k","This month’s sell-off caused a serious panic among traders, as Bitcoin corrected by over 10% from its recent high. It currently appears weak daily while attempting to break down a head-and-shoulders pattern. It’s been a tough month for Bitcoin as the price corrected under the $100k mark in the third week. Amid rising supply, the crypto further lost grip and fell to a low of $91,500 yesterday. These drops have caused a lot of panic in the market as sentiments turn negative in the short term due to fear uncertainty and doubt – FUD. The $90k level is standing well but how long it will hold is yet unknown. Looking at the price actions from a technical standpoint, BTC will likely chart more losses following a newly formed head-and-shoulder (H&S) pattern on the daily chart. A play out of this pattern could bring us back into the $80k range – a potential rebound area. Failure to recover from that price range could drive the price lower until it locates a threshold. The correction phase is still looking intact. Howbeit, it is important to note that the market remains bullish on a larger scale. Once it finds support, we can anticipate a fresh buying phase capable of rallying the price hard to a new high. BTC’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview Aside from $92,232, the monthly $90,500 low still stands as support. A break below it could slip the price to the $85,072 support. The $81,500 level is another support to consider for drops, where the three-month rising trendline lies. Holding the $90k level well, a resurge through the $99,540 level to a hidden $106,648 resistance could fuel the rally to $108,353 before breaking out to a new high. Key Resistance Levels: $99,540, $106,648, $108,353 Key Support Levels: $92,232, $85,072, $81,500 Spot Price: $94,109 Trend: Bearish Volatility: Moderate Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Understanding Forex charts and their various chart patterns is crucial for making informed trading decisions. Whether you’re a novice trader seeking to grasp the basics or an experienced trader looking to refine your strategies, mastering live Forex charts and knowing how to effectively read Forex charts can significantly enhance your trading performance. This comprehensive guide delves into the essential aspects of Forex charts, including chart patterns, live data, reading techniques, and the best sources for free Forex charts . 1. Understanding Forex Charts 1.1 What is a Forex Chart? A Forex chart is a graphical representation of the price movements of currency pairs in the foreign exchange market over a specified period. These charts display the historical data of currency prices, enabling traders to analyze trends, patterns, and potential future movements. By interpreting Forex charts , traders can make strategic decisions on when to enter or exit trades, manage risks, and optimize their trading strategies. 1.2 Types of Forex Charts There are several types of Forex charts that traders commonly use: Line Charts: Simple charts that connect the closing prices of a currency pair over a set period. They provide a clear view of the overall price trend but lack detailed information about price movements within each period. Bar Charts: These charts display the opening, closing, high, and low prices for each period. Each bar represents a specific timeframe, such as one hour or one day, providing more detailed information than line charts. Candlestick Charts: Similar to bar charts, candlestick charts show the opening, closing, high, and low prices. However, they use colored “candlesticks” to represent price movements, making it easier to identify bullish or bearish trends at a glance. Renko Charts: Focus solely on price movements, filtering out minor fluctuations and highlighting significant trends. They are particularly useful for identifying strong support and resistance levels. Heikin-Ashi Charts: A variation of candlestick charts that smooth out price data to better visualize trends and reversals, reducing market noise. 2.

These levels help in making entry and exit decisions. 3.1.5 Volume Analysis Analyze trading volume to confirm the strength of price movements. High volume during price increases suggests strong buying interest, while high volume during price decreases indicates strong selling pressure. 3.2 Advanced Techniques For more experienced traders, advanced techniques such as Elliott Wave Theory , Fibonacci Retracements , and Ichimoku Cloud can provide deeper insights into market dynamics and potential future price movements. 4.

Key Forex Concepts for IQD Trading 4.1 What is a Lot in Forex? A lot represents the standardized quantity of a currency pair being traded. In Forex, there are different types of lots: Standard Lot: 100,000 units of the base currency. Mini Lot: 10,000 units. Micro Lot: 1,000 units. Understanding lot sizes helps in managing risk and calculating potential profits or losses. 4.2 What is Leverage in Forex? Leverage allows traders to control larger positions with a smaller amount of capital. It is expressed as a ratio, such as 50:1 or 100:1. For example, with 100:1 leverage, a trader can control $100,000 worth of IQD with just $1,000. While leverage can amplify profits, it also increases the risk of significant losses. It’s essential to use leverage cautiously and implement effective risk management strategies. 4.3 What is Margin in Forex? Margin is the amount of money required to open and maintain a leveraged Forex position. It acts as a security deposit to cover potential losses. For instance, with 100:1 leverage, the margin requirement for a standard lot of USD/IQD would be 1% of the total trade size. Proper margin management is crucial to prevent margin calls and maintain a healthy trading account. 4.4 What is Spread in Forex? The spread is the difference between the bid price (selling price) and the ask price (buying price) of a currency pair. It represents the broker’s fee for facilitating the trade. Tight Spreads: Indicate lower transaction costs and are typically found in major currency pairs. Wide Spreads: Result in higher transaction costs and are common in exotic pairs like USD/IQD. Minimizing spreads can enhance trading profitability by reducing the cost of entering and exiting trades. 4.5 What is Liquidity in Forex? Liquidity refers to the ease with which a currency pair can be bought or sold without significantly affecting its price. High liquidity ensures that trades can be executed quickly and at stable prices. While major pairs like USD/EUR have high liquidity, exotic pairs like USD/IQD may have lower liquidity, leading to wider spreads and increased volatility. 4.6 What is US30 in Forex? US30 refers to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), a stock market index tracking 30 large, publicly-owned companies in the United States. In Forex trading, US30 is often traded as a Contract for Difference (CFD), allowing traders to speculate on its price movements without owning the underlying stocks. 4.7 What is NFP in Forex? NFP (Non-Farm Payrolls) is a key economic indicator released monthly by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. It measures the number of jobs added or lost in the U.S. economy, excluding the farming sector. NFP data significantly impacts Forex markets, influencing currency values based on the strength or weakness of the U.S. economy. 4.8 What is a Buy Stop in Forex? A buy stop is a type of pending order that becomes a market order once the price reaches a specified level above the current market price. It is used to enter a long position when the trader anticipates upward momentum. 4.9 What is Hedging in Forex? Hedging involves opening multiple positions to offset potential losses. For example, a trader holding a long position on USD/IQD might open a short position on the same pair to protect against adverse price movements. Hedging strategies help manage risk but can also limit potential profits. 5. Best Practices for Trading IQD on Forex 5.1 Conduct Thorough Market Research Stay informed about Iraq’s economic developments, geopolitical events, and global market trends that can influence the IQD’s value. Utilize financial news sources, economic reports, and analysis tools to stay updated. 5.2 Utilize Technical and Fundamental Analysis Combine technical analysis (chart patterns, indicators) with fundamental analysis (economic indicators, political stability) to make informed trading decisions. 5.3 Implement Risk Management Strategies Set Stop-Loss Orders: Protect your capital by defining the maximum loss you are willing to accept. Use Proper Lot Sizes: Avoid over-leveraging by choosing appropriate lot sizes based on your account balance and risk tolerance. Diversify Your Portfolio: Spread your investments across different currency pairs to mitigate risk. 5.4 Choose the Right Trading Strategy Adopt trading strategies that align with your risk appetite and trading style. Common strategies include: Scalping: Making multiple small trades for quick profits. Day Trading: Entering and exiting trades within the same day. Swing Trading: Holding positions for several days to capitalize on short- to medium-term trends. 5.5 Stay Disciplined and Avoid Emotional Trading Maintain a disciplined approach to trading by sticking to your strategy and avoiding impulsive decisions based on emotions. Use trading journals to track your trades and learn from your experiences. 6. Top Forex Signals Providers for IQD Trading 6.1 What are Forex Signals?

38345581,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53454,1735648225,"Best Cryptos to Buy and Hold for Long Term: How Qubetics, Chainlink, and Tezos Are Transforming Blockchain","Cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors are always on the hunt for digital assets that offer long-term growth potential. As the crypto landscape evolves, identifying projects that combine innovation, utility, and scalability has become paramount for smart investing. Qubetics ($TICS) , Chainlink (LINK), and Tezos (XTZ) are three blockchain projects making waves in the industry. Their unique use cases and strong community support make them some of the best cryptos to buy and hold for the long term. Let’s explore each of these transformative projects, starting with the fast-rising star, Qubetics. Qubetics: Pioneering Blockchain Innovation Qubetics Token has been gaining attention for its exceptional presale performance. In its 15th stage, the project has sold over 391 million $TICS tokens to more than 12,600 holders, raising an impressive $8.3 million. Priced at $0.041 per token, this is an excellent entry point before the anticipated 10% price surge at the weekend. Delivering Interoperability Across Networks Interoperability is a cornerstone of Qubetics’ mission. Imagine a multinational company streamlining its operations across different blockchain ecosystems—this is precisely the problem Qubetics solves. By ensuring seamless communication between blockchains, it unlocks efficiencies for businesses and decentralised applications alike. Exciting Analyst Predictions Investors are optimistic about Qubetics’ potential , with predictions of its token price reaching $0.25 by the presale’s end, a 630% ROI. Post-launch estimates suggest it could hit $15, representing an astounding 43,711% ROI. These projections make Qubetics a compelling choice for investors seeking the best cryptos to buy and hold for long-term gains. Chainlink: The Leader in Blockchain Oracles Chainlink is a pioneer in the blockchain oracle space, providing real-world data to smart contracts. This capability makes it a vital component for decentralised finance (DeFi) projects, supply chain systems, and insurance platforms. Chainlink’s extensive integrations across blockchains and industries highlight its importance. Over 1,700 projects leverage Chainlink’s oracle services, from price feeds for DeFi protocols to weather data for insurance claims. Known for its robust security framework, Chainlink has built a reputation as the go-to oracle provider in the blockchain industry. For developers and investors, its dependability ensures that it remains a top crypto to buy and hold. Tezos: A Self-Evolving Blockchain Tezos sets itself apart with its self-amending protocol, allowing the blockchain to upgrade without hard forks. This adaptability makes it future-proof and positions it as a key player in the blockchain space. Tezos is known for its energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, appealing to eco-conscious developers and businesses. Projects that prioritise sustainability will find Tezos an attractive platform. The Tezos ecosystem has seen significant growth, especially in non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and enterprise blockchain applications. From digital art marketplaces to corporate applications, Tezos continues to expand its influence. Why Qubetics Stands Out Qubetics is at the forefront of tokenising real-world assets. This technology enables the fractional ownership of physical assets like real estate, commodities, or luxury goods. For instance, a real estate firm could tokenise properties to attract global investors without the barriers of traditional finance. Businesses operating internationally often face delays and high costs with traditional cross-border transactions . Qubetics addresses these challenges with its blockchain-powered solutions, ensuring almost-instant and cost-effective global transactions. Projections for a $35,000 Investment Based on current presale pricing, a $35,000 investment in $TICS tokens could yield remarkable returns. If the token hits its projected $15 post-mainnet launch, this investment could grow exponentially, offering significant financial gains. Conclusion For investors seeking the best cryptos to buy and hold for the long term , Qubetics, Chainlink, and Tezos offer unique value propositions. Qubetics shines with its focus on interoperability and asset tokenisation, while Chainlink and Tezos continue to drive innovation in oracles and blockchain adaptability. Now is the time to explore Qubetics and become part of a forward-thinking blockchain ecosystem. With its presale gaining momentum and significant growth on the horizon, Qubetics stands out as a remarkable investment opportunity.

38344291,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=668366,1735648211,"Ethereum’s Large Consolidation Trend Points To Possible Price Explosion To $8,000","Although Ethereum is currently up by about 46% from the starting point at the beginning of 2024, December has been underlined by a notable correction. This correction saw Ethereum declining noticeably from a $4,000 price point in the middle of the month, and it now finds itself consolidating below $3,400. Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade recently shared a bullish outlook for Ethereum in light of this consolidation. Particularly, the analyst has projected a surge to $8,000 sometime in 2025. Historical Pattern Says Bullish Trajectory For Ethereum Trader Tardigrade, known for identifying long-term market trends, took to social media platform X to share insights into Ethereum’s price potential. According to technical analysis, the second-largest cryptocurrency is now in its final consolidation phase before commencing a strong leg upwards. This consolidation has made ETH’s previous all-time high look unsurmountable, especially as it has faced resistance at the $4,000 price level multiple times in the current market cycle. Despite this, according to Trader Tardigrade, Ethereum’s target of $8,000 remains unchanged. Related Reading: Legendary Analyst Peter Brandt Says Bitcoin Price Could Crash To $78,000, Here’s Why The foundation of Trader Tardigrade’s analysis lies in ETH’s weekly candlestick chart, where patterns from the previous market cycle between 2018 and 2021 provide a roadmap for its current trajectory. During that earlier cycle, Ethereum consolidated near the $500 mark for an extended period, and its then all-time high of $1,500 seemed out of reach. However, this consolidation was followed by an explosive rally in 2021 amidst a backdrop of inflows and interest in the broader cryptocurrency market. Trader Tardigrade sees parallels between that historical period and Ethereum’s ongoing price action in the 2021–2025 cycle. Therefore, the cryptocurrency’s current consolidation phase is building the necessary momentum for a similar rally, one that could ultimately push Ethereum to an unprecedented $8,000 price. ETH Long-Term Holders Await Renewed Rally To New All-Time Highs Reaching the $8,000 price target would see Ethereum trading at new highs and 64% above its current all-time high of $4,878. Although this outlook is based on parallels with the 2021 rally, factors that could push ETH in the current cycle are very different than they were back then. Ethereum’s rally in 2021 was bolstered by interest in decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), dApps, and smart contracts, of which ETH was at the forefront. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price At $5: Analyzing Previous Trends And Why A 1,500% Rally Is Possible Recent market dynamics place factors such as institutional demand and inflows into Spot Ethereum ETFs as the major drivers of any projected Ethereum price rally at this point. Amidst this backdrop, on-chain data shows that Ethereum has attracted more long-term holders in 2024 compared to Bitcoin. As it stands, around 75% of ETH holders qualify as long-term holders, with many of them anticipating ETH’s move above $5,000 and beyond in 2025. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $3,354, and a move to $8,000 would represent a 140% increase from the current price level.

Does Bitcoin's Decline Have an Impact? Here Are the Details,"MicroStrategy (MSTR) shares fell below $300 in after-hours trading on Monday, a significant 46% drop from their November peak. MicroStrategy Shares Drop Below $300 Amid Investor Concerns Over Bitcoin Strategy The decline comes as the company faces scrutiny over its plan to raise billions of dollars to fund its aggressive Bitcoin buying strategy. Shares of MicroStrategy fell 8.2% to $302.96 on Monday, the lowest closing price since Nov. 8, according to Google Finance data. They fell another 3% to $293.59 in after-hours trading. Despite a 342% year-to-date gain, supported by Bitcoin’s 121% annual price increase, MSTR has been falling since reaching an intraday high of $543 on Nov. 21. Bitcoin Holdings and Nasdaq Inclusion MicroStrategy continues to expand its Bitcoin holdings, purchasing 2,138 BTC last week, bringing its total to 446,400 BTC. MSTR was also included in the Nasdaq 100 index on Dec. 23, a move that some hope will stabilize investor confidence. However, these developments have not alleviated concerns about the company's financial strategies. Financing Strategy Sparks Controversy The company’s “21/21” plan, announced in October, aims to raise $42 billion over three years to support bitcoin purchases, including $21 billion in new equity and $21 billion in fixed-income securities issuance. Earlier this month, MicroStrategy proposed increasing its Class A common shares by 10 billion and its preferred shares by 1 billion. The offer drew mixed reactions, with critics warning of shareholder dilution. Nick Ruck, director of LVRG Research, highlighted the risks: “If the company buys more BTC, existing shareholders will be diluted, but if it doesn’t, it could signal that the company is stalling on a significant part of its value proposition. This places MSTR in dangerous territory, especially as Bitcoin’s recent rally potentially plateaus.” *This is not investment advice.

Its stock has tumbled almost 50% since November, when it joined the Nasdaq 100 index and peaked at a 600% gain since the start of the year.  That still leaves the Tysons Corner, Virginia-based company a whopping 342% ahead in 2024, the biggest return among the highest-profile crypto-linked assets in traditional finance (TradFi).  It's been a volatile year, packed with geopolitical and technological developments to rattle financial markets. The continuing wars in eastern Europe and the Middle East, elections across the globe, the unwinding of the yen carry trade in August and the growth of artificial intelligence (AI) have all left their marks.  MicroStrategy's gain is almost double that of Nvidia (NVDA), the chipmaker whose production of integrated circuits needed for AI applications fueled a 185% return, the best among the so-called magnificent seven tech stocks. The next best, Meta Platforms (META), turned in 71%.  Bitcoin itself rose 100% in a year that included April's reward halving and multiple record highs. Demand for the largest cryptocurrency was driven by the January approval of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. Bitcoin outperformed two of its biggest competitors, ether (ETH), up 42%, and Solana (SOL), up 79%.  Among the ETF's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) also returned over 100% and became the fastest ETF in history to hit $50 billion in assets.   Bitcoin mining companies, on the whole, disappointed. Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF (WGMI), a proxy for mining stocks, rose just under 30%. That's despite demand for the miners' computing capabilities and power supply agreements from artificial intelligence and high-performance computing (HPC) companies. Still, individual companies benefited, in particular, Bitdeer (BTDR),which added 151%, and WULF (WULF), which gained 131%.  Nevertheless, the miners' gains beat the broader equities market. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index (NDX) added 28% while the S&P 500 Index (SPX) rose 25%. The S&P 500 also trailed behind gold's 27% increase. The precious commodity has now topped the equity gauge in three of the past five years.  Concerns about U.S. inflation and the country's budget deficit added to the geopolitical uncertainties to prompt a massive rise in U.S. treasury yields, which move in the opposite direction to price.   The yield on the 10-Year Treasury added 15% to 4.5% over the course of the year, and surprisingly gained a full 100 basis points since the Federal Reserve started cutting interest rates in September.  The iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT), which tracks bond prices, dropped 10% this year and has lost 40% in the past five years.  The dollar, on the other hand, showed its strength. The DXY Index (DXY), a measure of the greenback against a basket of the currencies of the U.S.' biggest trading partners, rose to the highest since September 2022.  West Texas Intermediate (USOIL), the benchmark oil price in the U.S., ends the year little changed, up less than 1% to around $71 a barrel. But it was a bumpy ride, with the price rising to almost $90 at some points in the past 12 months.   As we head into the new year, all eyes will be on the debt ceiling discussion, the policies of President-elect Donald Trump and whether the U.S. can continue with its impressive growth story.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION | TRADING,James Van Straten,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/12/31/micro-strategys-dismal-december-still-keeps-it-at-top-of-2024-bitcoin-tied-asset-rankings,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/99f87a28ffc986d4489aebaa1cc5431f95a791aa-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
38344134,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=635373,1735647639,ByteDance’s $7B AI push amid looming TikTok ban,"TikTok parent company ByteDance is betting big on Artificial Intelligence (AI) despite the United States’ curbs on chip sales to China. According to a report by The Information, the TikTok owner plans to spend $7 billion on Nvidia chips in 2025. This comes as President-elect Donald Trump intervened in the TikTok ban. Trump has urged the US Supreme Court to delay the January 19 TikTok ban deadline. He is seeking time for a “political resolution.” Meanwhile, ByteDance has denied links to the Chinese government over the allegations of security concerns. ByteDance sidesteps US AI chip curbs As per the report , ByteDance is looking to become one of the largest consumers of AI hardware. It is relying on external suppliers to sidestep US restrictions. Chinese firms reportedly bypass restrictions by setting up new entities or training AI models outside the country. The United States announced restrictions on certain kinds of AI chips exported to nations like China in 2022. Four Chinese industry associations also warned against over-reliance on US-made chips and security concerns. This could potentially impact companies like Nvidia, AMD, and Intel. ByteDance, which is headquartered in China, is picking loopholes in the curbs by not bringing chips directly to its country. The company is reportedly storing them in data centers located in other regions like Southeast Asia. This move technically doesn’t violate any of the US-imposed restrictions. Trump urges Supreme Court to delay TikTok ban The US President-elect is asking the Apex Court to delay the looming TikTok ban while seeking time to pursue a “political resolution.” Meanwhile, the law requiring ByteDance to divest TikTok or face a ban by January 19 is fast approaching. US officials and lawmakers have cited ByteDance’s ties to the Chinese government as cause for concern. The company has filed multiple legal challenges. It argues that the law violates free speech protections but with little success so far. The Supreme Court will hear arguments on January 10 and will give ByteDance, TikTok, and the US government one last chance to make their case. Trump hopes to push the deadline back to avoid a ban that would impact TikTok’s 170 million US users. Trump met TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew last week and described the social media platform as having a “warm spot in his heart.” Meanwhile, the Justice Department and over 20 state attorneys general argue the app is a national security risk. They’re urging the court to uphold the law that Congress and President Biden approved earlier this year.

38346667,https://cryptonews.com/?p=323675,1735647182,Crypto Art Is the “Set It and Forget It” Investment of the Decade – Raoul Pal,"Crypto art is poised to become a top long-term investment, claims Real Vision CEO and co-founder Raoul Pal. “My highest conviction “set it and forget it” investment for the next 10 years is crypto art. For me it’s the most compelling, enjoyable and interesting area in all crypto,” wrote Pal in this X post from Dec. 30. Pal argues that a confluence of factors will drive significant demand for these digital assets in the form of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) . These include the burgeoning wealth generated within the cryptocurrency market, the ongoing devaluation of traditional currencies, and a growing preference for digital assets among younger generations. My highest conviction ""set it and forget it"" investment for the next 10 years is crypto art. For me it's the most compelling, enjoyable and interesting area in all crypto. Massive crypto wealth creation, along with monetary debasement, will drive incredible demand for scarce… — Raoul Pal (@RaoulGMI) December 29, 2024 Pal believes that crypto art, particularly rare and desirable pieces , will emerge as a highly valuable asset class: “If, as [Michael] Saylor says, BTC is Manhattan real estate then the best crypto art or NFT’s are the scarcest, most desirable block space of all.” Crypto Art as a Store of Value Furthermore, Pal highlights the inherent advantages of crypto art as an investment . Unlike physical property, which can incur substantial maintenance costs and may be more suitable as a lifestyle asset, crypto art offers significantly lower storage costs and can even serve as collateral. Pal views crypto art as a mechanism for tokenizing culture and community, transforming previously intangible concepts into valuable assets. Pal points to the “Lindy Effect,” where assets that endure over time gain significant value, as a compelling indicator of the long-term growth potential within the crypto art market. CryptoPunks is one of the most successful NFT projects. Source: CryptoPunks “Art has always been upstream and at the nexus of culture, status and money and it will remain so,” said Pal, adding that the most quality art pieces are priced in Ether ( ETH ) and will tend to outperform Ether over time. “ For example, the Beeple series have probably 3x’d ETH performance this year. Seriously valuable art will likely stay on ETH (and to a lesser extent BTC) due to the security needed to secure large single value pieces.” NFTs Are More Than Just Money While financial returns are a crucial aspect, Pal also emphasizes that many collectors prioritize building exceptional collections and actively supporting the growth of the crypto art ecosystem: “Most collectors are trying to build the best collections possible in these early days and also act as patrons to the space to help it flourish. The days of flipping art NFTs is largely over. The game now is to buy and hold the best artists (new or older) and demand will only grow over time while supply gets taken off the market for decades. There is realistically very little supply of established art currently and it will keep shrinking.” Pal cited Cryptopunks, Bored Apes, and Grifters as examples of influential profile picture (PFP) projects. He also recommended exploring “ultra-bargain buys” like CryptoDickbutts and collections like MFers and Rektguy NFTs. Pal concluded by advising readers to embark on their crypto art journey with an open mind, as it can lead to a deep dive into the world of digital art. “The mediums will change massively over time as holograms and holodecks become the dominant substrate for digital life,” he added. CryptoDickbutts NFT collection saw a 310% increase in sales volume over the last 2 months. Source: OpenSea NFT Market Resilient in 2024 Despite facing challenges in 2024, NFTs continued to find their place within the Web3 landscape. According to data tracker CryptoSlam, NFT sales volume reached approximately $8.8 billion in 2024, a slight increase compared to the previous year, when NFT sales volume recorded $8.7 billion, However, the number of active NFT buyers surged to 7.6 million, marking a 69% year-over-year increase from the 4.5 million buyers observed in 2023. The number of NFT sellers also increased in 2024 by 7% and reached over 4 million. Global NFT sales volume reached $8.8 billion in 2024.

In December, Ethereum-based Pudgy Penguins led the charge in NFT sales volume, surging 676% to surpass $115 million. Azuki followed, boasting a 598% sales volume increase and reaching nearly $41 million. Lil Pudgys also experienced a remarkable 868% jump in sales volume, recording $34.5 million.

VeChain (VET): Enhancing Supply Chain Transparency with Blockchain VeChain (VET) is a blockchain platform that improves supply chain management. It assigns unique IDs and sensors to physical products, allowing detailed tracking through the supply chain. Founded in 2015 by Sunny Lu, former CIO at Louis Vuitton China, VeChain moved to its own blockchain, VeChainThor, in 2018. It uses a dual-token system: VET for value transfer and VeThor Token (VTHO) for transaction fees. Partnerships with companies like PricewaterhouseCoopers, Walmart China, and BMW highlight its practical use. VET ranks among the top 40 in market cap, showing significant adoption. In the current market cycle, VeChain’s focus on real-world applications and expanding partnerships makes it an attractive option. Ethena (ENA) A Synthetic Dollar Protocol on Ethereum Ethena ENA is a synthetic dollar protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain. It aims to provide a crypto-native solution for a stable currency that does not rely on traditional banking infrastructure. Ethena offers a globally accessible, dollar-denominated savings instrument known as the Internet Bond. This technology has the potential to address the need for decentralized stablecoins in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. By eliminating dependence on banks, Ethena seeks to enhance financial accessibility and resilience. In the current market cycle, interest in decentralized finance solutions remains strong, and Ethena’s approach to synthetic assets could make it an attractive option for users seeking stability and yield within the crypto space. ONDO Finance: Tokenizing Real-World Assets for Broader Accessibility ONDO Finance bridges traditional finance and blockchain by tokenizing stable, income-generating real-world assets. This approach democratizes access to high-grade financial products, using blockchain to enhance financial infrastructure. ONDO’s structure includes an asset management arm creating tokenized financial products and a technology arm developing decentralized finance protocols to improve functionality and scalability. Collaborations with reputable partners like BlackRock and Coinbase underscore its commitment to quality and security. Notably, USDY offers stablecoin accessibility and yield, secured by U.S. Treasuries and bank demand deposits. In the evolving cryptocurrency market, ONDO’s focus on transparency, compliance, and real-world asset integration may position it as an attractive option, though individuals should assess its suitability based on current market conditions. Fetch.ai (FET): Decentralized AI and Machine Learning with Crypto Economy Founded in 2017 and launched on Binance in 2019, Fetch.ai (FET) is an AI lab building an open, decentralized machine learning network powered by a crypto economy. Fetch.ai aims to make AI technology accessible by allowing anyone to connect and share secure data using autonomous AI agents on its permissionless network. The platform focuses on applications like optimizing DeFi trading, transportation networks, smart energy grids, and travel systems. Based on historical price trends and Bitcoin halving cycles, FET’s price could reach up to $1.024293 by 2025. The coin’s technology and practical applications suggest potential growth, making Fetch.ai an attractive option in the current market cycle. Conclusion While ENA, ONDO, FET, and VET show less short-term potential, Catzilla shines as the ultimate meme coin hero aiming to bring financial freedom to everyone. With a 700% ROI potential during its presale and triple utility features—governance, rewards, and staking—Catzilla invites enthusiasts to join the battle against crypto villains and participate in a rewarding venture.

38343544,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=635374,1735646495,The Fed and Trump are set to collide in 2025 – The areas to expect trouble,"The longstanding tensions between President-elect Donald Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell are expected to take center stage again in 2025, with economic policies and institutional dynamics setting the stage for potential clashes. Donald Trump, reelected in November 2024, frequently criticizes Powell. This raises questions about how the relationship between the White House and the Federal Reserve might evolve in the coming year. Throughout 2024, Trump publicly attacked Powell’s leadership, arguing that the president should have greater influence over Federal Reserve decisions. On the campaign trail, Trump claimed Powell had “gotten it wrong a lot” and suggested that his administration could reexamine the Fed’s independence. Federal Reserve spending under a ‘microscope’ After Trump’s reelection, Powell forcefully dismissed rumors of being removed from his position, emphasizing his intent to serve out his term, which expires in May 2026. However, even if Powell retains his position, analysts expect renewed friction between the administration and the Fed. The President-elect has appointed billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk and businessman Vivek Ramaswamy to head the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.GE). The duo has pledged to overhaul federal spending, and their plans could include significant changes at the Federal Reserve. Musk recently called the Fed “absurdly overstaffed” on his social media platform X, hinting at potential workforce reductions. The Fed is absurdly overstaffed — Kekius Maximus (@elonmusk) December 23, 2024 According to a report from Yahoo Finance, the Federal Reserve employs approximately 24,000 individuals across the United States, with 86% of its workforce stationed in regional reserve banks. The headquarters in Washington, D.C., houses about 3,000 employees. Unlike most federal agencies, the Fed operates independently of taxpayer funding, financing itself through revenue generated by government securities. Despite its independence, critics do not see the Fed’s operational expenses as insignificant. In 2024, its net operating expenses were budgeted at $7.1 billion, roughly 0.1% of the federal government’s total budget. Historically, the Fed has sent excess revenue to the U.S. Treasury, transferring nearly $1 trillion between 2012 and 2021. Trump’s economic policies clash with the Fed’s plan Trump recently announced plans to impose steep tariffs: 10% on imports from China and 25% on goods from Mexico and Canada. These measures, aimed at boosting domestic manufacturing, are projected to have significant economic repercussions. EY Chief Economist Gregory Daco warned that the tariffs could lead to stagflation , marked by slower economic growth and higher inflation. He estimates that the tariffs would reduce US GDP by 1.5% in 2025 while increasing inflation by 0.4%. Financial market volatility could also follow, adding pressure to an economy already grappling with persistent inflation. However, not all experts share Daco’s concerns about inflation. Former St. Louis Fed President Jim Bullard, who served during Trump’s first term, argued that the growth-reducing effects of tariffs might offset any inflationary impacts. “ The detriment to the world economy would outweigh any price effects, ” Bullard noted, casting doubt on the notion that tariffs alone would drive inflation higher. Interest rates in question, again The Federal Reserve’s December 2024 meeting forecasts suggested a cautious path for interest rates. Markets anticipated that the federal funds rate would drop slightly to 3.9% by December 2025, compared to the current target range of 4.25-4.5%. However, these projections look rather too optimistic given the potential inflationary pressures from Trump’s economic agenda, including tax cuts, tariffs, and immigration policies. Financial analysts from the Financial Times noted that the Fed’s cautious stance could diverge from the more aggressive rate-cutting strategies of the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of England, further complicating the global economic landscape. Trump’s economic policies, combined with Musk and Ramaswamy’s cost-cutting initiatives, may pose significant challenges for the Federal Reserve. While the Fed has historically operated with substantial independence, tensions with the White House could test that autonomy.

Immediate resistance is noted at $95,234, followed by $96,860 and $98,361. On the downside, support levels at $92,103 and $89,613 are crucial for bulls to defend. Technical indicators suggest mixed momentum. Bitcoin is trading below its 50 EMA at $94,849, reflecting near-term bearish sentiment. Meanwhile, the RSI at 48.38 signals improving momentum, indicating potential for a bullish reversal if buying pressure increases. Analyst’s Outlook: Caution Amid Uncertainty Rekt Capital emphasizes that Bitcoin must reclaim the $94,250 level to prevent a sharper decline into the low $90,000s. However, the triple-bottom formation suggests resilience, with bulls likely to remain active near $92,000. Traders should monitor these key levels closely as BTC navigates this critical phase.

38343190,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=376841,1735645905,Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Risks Falling to $81K if it Breaks Below This Support Level,"Bitcoin is struggling with the midline of its prolonged ascending channel around the $92K mark, teetering on the edge of a potential breakdown. Despite this, the cryptocurrency has several key support levels ahead, fueling optimism for a possible bullish recovery in the near future. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart Bitcoin has recently faced a notable correction, with the price currently stabilizing at the ascending channel’s middle trendline near the $92K mark. This level acts as a critical support zone, historically representing a significant area of demand. Despite this support, sellers have exerted considerable pressure, threatening to break below this key threshold. In the event of a successful breach, Bitcoin could experience a cascade of long liquidations, potentially driving the price downward toward the 100-day moving average of $81K. This MA represents a robust dynamic support, likely to attract substantial buying interest and mitigate further downside momentum. Conversely, a rebound at the current level could see Bitcoin regain bullish momentum, aiming to retest the $108K upper boundary of the channel in the mid-term. The 4-Hour Chart On the lower timeframe, Bitcoin has breached the middle trendline of its multi-month ascending channel, signaling increased distribution among participants. This bearish development coincides with growing market uncertainty as investors anticipate potential volatility surrounding President Trump’s inauguration on January 20, 2025. Currently, Bitcoin hovers near a critical support range defined by the $90K threshold and the Fibonacci retracement levels at 0.5 ($87K) and 0.618 ($82K). This region is a formidable barrier to further selling pressure and is expected to trigger a market reversal. On-chain Analysis By Shayan Bitcoin market participants remain uncertain about the continuation of the bullish trend, with speculation revolving around whether higher prices are imminent or if the rally has concluded. A critical on-chain metric providing insight into this behavior is the realized price UTXO age bands, particularly for the 1-3 month (short-term) cohort. The realized price for this cohort acts as a dynamic threshold, reflecting the average price at which these recent buyers acquired their holdings. When BTC sustains above this realized price, it signals growing bullish momentum, indicating that new buyers are confident enough to hold despite elevated levels. On the contrary, a price drop below this threshold suggests a heightened risk of a sell-off, as these participants enter loss territory and may resort to panic selling, increasing downward pressure on the market. Currently, the realized price of the 1-3 month cohort resides at the $81K region, marking it as a critical support zone. This level is viewed as the primary defense line for buyers in the long-term outlook, with its ability to hold likely determining the broader market’s direction.

38343166,https://finbold.com/?p=224542,1735645846,Why MicroStrategy stock is crashing after another Bitcoin buying spree,"The share price of American business intelligence firm MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR ) is on a downward spiral as the company continues its aggressive Bitcoin ( BTC ) buying strategy. At the close of the last trading session, MSTR’s stock price was valued at $302.96, ending the day down over 8%. This decline extended losses seen on the weekly timeframe, with the equity plunging 15%. However, MSTR remains one of the best-performing stocks of 2024, rallying 342% year-to-date. Ahead of trading on the year’s final day, MSTR’s share price is up almost 3%, showing signs of recovery. MSTR one-day stock price chart. Source: Google Finance Why MSTR stock is down This plunge follows MicroStrategy’s latest Bitcoin acquisition of 2,138 BTC for $209 million at an average price of $97,837 per Bitcoin. The company holds a total of 446,400 BTC, acquired for $27.9 billion at an average price of $62,428 per Bitcoin. While partly aligned with general market momentum, the stock’s ongoing short-term correction can be attributed to the company’s Bitcoin strategy. In this case, according to financial analysis platform The Kobeissi Letter in a December 30 X post , the market appears uneasy with MicroStrategy’s proposal to dramatically increase its authorized share count—from the current 330 million shares to a staggering 10.33 billion. If approved, this move would represent a significant shift in the company’s capital structure. It would enable continued Bitcoin acquisitions but dilute existing shareholders. Conversely, rejection of the proposal would limit the company’s ability to grow its Bitcoin holdings, a key component of its strategy. Amid this dilemma, The Kobeissi Letter observed that over the past month, MSTR shares have dropped nearly 50%, diverging sharply from Bitcoin’s modest 2% gain, as investors question the sustainability of MicroStrategy’s leveraged Bitcoin-centric model. MSTR stock’s optimistic and cautious outlook On the other hand, Felix Hartmann, founder of Hartmann Capital, expressed an optimistic yet cautious outlook in a December 30 X post . He projected that MicroStrategy stock could rise to become one of the world’s top companies by market cap before collapsing. “Within 5 years, MSTR will first become a top 5 company by market cap before eventually going bankrupt. We’re still early,” he warned. Hartmann cited several factors supporting the company’s near-term resilience. Much of MicroStrategy’s debt carries near-zero interest rates and matures between 2027 and 2030, minimizing immediate repayment pressures. Furthermore, while slowing Bitcoin purchases could unsettle markets, the company is unlikely to sell its holdings before 2025. He also emphasized Bitcoin’s inherent volatility, which creates cycles of skepticism during price dips and renewed confidence during rallies, ultimately boosting MicroStrategy’s valuation. However, he believes long-term challenges, such as maturing debt and unrealized losses on Bitcoin investments, will eventually undermine the company. Criticisms of MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin plan MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy, spearheaded by executive chairman Michael Saylor, has drawn praise and criticism . For example, American economist Peter Schiff has accused Saylor of gambling with investors’ money through the Bitcoin accumulation plan, warning that the firm is likely to dispose of its BTC holdings once the asset’s price plummets. Additionally, celebrity investor and author Robert Kiyosaki praised Saylor’s strategy as “genius,” commending the executive for creating wealth for MSTR investors. In conclusion, it remains to be seen how the Bitcoin strategy plays amid the mounting concerns despite MicroStrategy yielding significant gains.

SEC Approval Spurs Bitcoin ETF Growth The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the first Bitcoin spot ETFs in January 2024, enabling issuers like BlackRock and Grayscale to launch their products. On January 11, 11 issuers, including BlackRock's IBIT and Grayscale’s GBTC, began trading. Investor demand was immediate, with IBIT securing the lion’s share of inflows, cementing its dominant position. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart called IBIT’s growth “unprecedented,” adding that the ETF could generate $112 million annually, based on its 0.25% expense ratio and current asset level. Dominance Across Multiple Markets IBIT's success is not limited to the spot ETF market. In September, the SEC approved options trading for BlackRock’s Bitcoin spot ETF, which began on Nasdaq in November. Within a month, IBIT's options contract recorded a 20-day average daily notional volume of $1.7 billion, ranking seventh among the most active ETF options in the market. Todd Sohn, managing director at Strategas Securities, highlighted IBIT's scale, comparing it to the combined assets of more than 50 European ETFs, many of which have existed for decades. Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, referred to IBIT’s launch as “the greatest in ETF history.” Catalyst for Bitcoin’s Record Price Surge BlackRock’s influence as a global investment leader, managing $11 trillion in assets, has been a significant driver behind Bitcoin’s remarkable 2024 performance. Bitcoin’s price more than doubled this year, reaching an all-time high of $108,000 in December. Analysts attribute this growth to inflows from Bitcoin ETFs and favorable macroeconomic conditions. The introduction of Bitcoin spot ETFs has been monumental for cryptocurrency investments. IBIT’s success is proof of growing mainstream acceptance and investor confidence in Bitcoin as an asset class. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Homosexual Pepe (HOMOPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HOMOPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Homosexual Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homosexual Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Homosexual Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homosexual Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homosexual Pepe by entering its contract address – 92xPeBxtanptFH9AYsRtwRMq7cWWw9GHfxaspwpNvCTP – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMOPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/homosexual-pepe-homopepe-solana-memecoin-to-surge-18000-ahead-of-exchange-listings-while-shib-bonk-and-doge-crash/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

38343594,192505,1735645486,"Bitget Completes First-Ever Burn of 800 Million BGB Tokens, Reducing Supply by 40%","Victoria, Seychelles, December 31st, 2024, Chainwire Bitget , the leading cryptocurrency exchange and Web3 company has successfully completed the initial burn of its native Bitget Token (BGB), reducing the total supply by 40%. This strategic move involved burning 800 million BGB tokens, effectively decreasing the total supply from 2 billion to 1.2 billion tokens. The burn process was executed by transferring the tokens to a designated burn address, ensuring their permanent removal from circulation. The distribution of the burned tokens was as follows: 19% originated from holdings by the core team, while the remaining 21% comprised tokens from both circulating supply and additional core team reserves. This action reflects Bitget's strategic approach to enhancing the value and scarcity of BGB, aligning with industry practices aimed at benefiting token holders. Looking ahead, Bitget has outlined a quarterly BGB burn mechanism set to commence in 2025. Under this plan, 20% of quarterly profits from exchange and wallet operations will be allocated to repurchase and burn BGB tokens. The profits considered for this mechanism encompass transaction fees from spot, futures, and margin trading on the Bitget exchange, as well as income from swaps, futures, and NFT trading on the Bitget Wallet. “This initial burn, with a substantial contribution from the core team’s holdings, is an example of our belief in attaining success with the interests of our community. With the reduction in supply; BGB signifies the foundation of a stronger and more resilient ecosystem that benefits all stakeholders,” said Gracy Chen, CEO at Bitget. The buyback and burn process will occur quarterly, typically finalized at the beginning of the subsequent quarter. Following each buyback, the acquired BGB tokens will be destroyed by sending them to a burn address. Bitget commits to transparency by publishing the exact amount burned and providing on-chain records after each burn event. This initiative shows Bitget's dedication to enhancing the utility and value of BGB within its ecosystem. By systematically reducing the token supply, Bitget aims to create a more robust and sustainable environment for its users and stakeholders.

38342988,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=376799,1735645452,Pepe (PEPE) Defies Market Sentiment With 6% Surge After Interaction From Elon Musk: Details,"TL;DR Amid a broader meme coin decline, PEPE surged 6%, with its market cap surpassing $8 billion. Its revival happened shortly after Elon Musk changed his profile picture on X with a frog dressed as a Roman soldier. PEPE on the Run The latest crypto market correction has severely affected the meme coin sector, with many tokens charting substantial weekly declines. For instance, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is down 6%, while dogwifhat (WIF) has plunged 9%. The past 24 hours have also been painful for the bulls, with SHIB, BONK, PENGU, and many more heading south. However, Pepe (PEPE) defied the negative trend, recording a 6% price upswing. The frog-themed token also saw its market capitalization rising above $8 billion again, solidifying it as the third-biggest meme coin. PEPE Price, Source: CoinGecko PEPE’s resurgence could be linked to one of Elon Musk’s latest interactions on X. The owner of the social media platform changed his profile picture to Kekius Maximus – a frog that wears Roman armor. KEKIUS is a meme coin operating on multiple blockchain platforms, including Ethereum and Solana. It saw the light of day in mid-December and up until Musk’s post was trading sideways at approximately $0.01 . The endorsement from one of the richest people on the planet triggered a massive resurgence for KEKIUS, whose price skyrocketed by 550% in the past 24 hours. Nonetheless, its market capitalization remains below $100 million, meaning it is far from reaching the top 100 club (at least as of the moment). Musk and Memes This is not the first time the billionaire has made waves in the meme coin niche with his posts on X. Musk is known as a huge proponent of Dogecoin (DOGE), often praising its merits and endorsing it on the social media platform. Last month, the biggest meme coin experienced a 10% price increase after Tesla’s CEO talked about the establishment of a Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) should Donald Trump win the US presidential elections. The Republican emerged victorious and put Musk in charge of this division. D.O.G.E. will aim to streamline the US federal government by reducing wasteful spending and eliminating unnecessary regulatory agencies. Floki Inu (FLOKI) is another meme coin that has witnessed a price boost after comments from Elon Musk. In February 2023, he posted a picture of his dog dressed as the CEO of Twitter (as X was called back then). Musk’s pet is named Floki, which explains why the eponymous meme coin shot by over 40% shortly after the interaction.

Here's The Most Prominent Reason!,"The cryptocurrency market experienced notable outflows from Bitcoin and Ethereum spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on Dec. 30, signaling a continuation of the trend of year-end profit-taking and investor pullbacks amid market uncertainty. Bitcoin and Ethereum Spot ETFs See Significant Outflows as Year-End Approaches Bitcoin Spot ETF Outflows Bitcoin spot ETFs recorded a total net outflow of $426 million, extending their consecutive daily outflow streak to two days. Among them, Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) reported a single-day net outflow of $135 million, contributing to a staggering total historical net outflow of $21.487 billion. Ethereum Spot ETF Exits Ethereum spot ETFs also saw significant investor withdrawals, with a total net outflow of $55.4 million on Dec. 30. This was the first net outflow after four consecutive days of net inflows. Similarly, Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE) reported a single-day net outflow of $17.4 million, signaling waning investor confidence as 2024 approaches. The outflows come amid heightened market volatility and a broader reallocation of assets as investors reassess their portfolios. While spot ETFs saw significant inflows during bullish periods earlier this year, the recent trend points to cautious sentiment in the crypto market. Analysts point to factors such as profit-taking, macroeconomic uncertainty and competition from alternative investment products as possible reasons for the withdrawals. The year-end period often sees portfolio adjustments, which could further exacerbate outflows in the coming days. As the market enters 2025, all eyes will be on the cryptocurrency world, with regulatory developments, institutional involvement, and macroeconomic conditions set to play a key role in shaping investor behavior. *This is not investment advice.

38342967,https://crypto.news/?p=14323413,1735645393,Crypto whales: Friends or foes?,"The closing weeks of 2024 saw vintage crypto wallets waking and moving tens and hundreds of tokens to exchanges or other addresses. Public curiosity is by far not the only impact of such transactions. Let’s see how the whale transactions influence the market and why not everyone is happy about them. Table of Contents The whales’ transactions Christmas rampage When whales hold When whales sell Alleged market manipulations Crypto whales: friends or foes? The whales’ transactions Christmas rampage On Dec. 25, 2024, the Bitcoin wallet that was kept untouched for nearly 14 years moved 20.55 BTC to another address. During the years in the wallet, these coins gained over $2 million in value. The same day, a different wallet released 210 BTC after ten years of inactivity. This BTC stash grew by $20 million while being hodled. Two days later, someone moved 1,940 ETH from the pre-mine address to Coinbase. These ether tokens were dormant from the launch of the Ethereum network. The following days saw other huge transactions involving long-time sleepers. Read more: 200k Ethereum genesis whale awakens: $11.37m sent to Kraken For instance, on Dec. 29 it was reported that someone sent 7,000 BTC from the address that was inactive for seven years to several different addresses, splitting the sum into seven 1,000 BTC outputs. This chad held on to 7,000 BTC for 7 years, hodled from 62M$ to 663M$, the funds haven't been sold they just split them into 1,000 BTC addresses. https://t.co/1FhOHUjUOH — Sani | TimechainIndex.com (@SaniExp) December 29, 2024 Reporters share the opinion that these bitcoins weren’t sold; they just moved to other wallets. In seven years, the 7k BTC stash value grew by several hundred million dollars. On the same day, the address that had been silent since 2014 sent 357.4 BTC to other addresses. When whales hold As of Dec. 30, 2024, there are four wallets holding nearly 650k BTC, which is over 3% of the total supply. All of these addresses are the cold wallets of the crypto exchanges. According to the Bitinfocharts tool, less than 100 Bitcoin addresses hold around 15% of the entire supply; many of these addresses probably belong to individuals. If they decide to move their millions worth of crypto coins, it may trigger a bearish reversal even in the uptrend. When whales hold their crypto, they decrease its liquidity. Just think of billions worth of cryptocurrency that has not moved for years! Almost half of all bitcoins are held in wallets that have between 100 and 10,000 bitcoins on the balance. This group of whales impacts liquidity and value the most. Many of them haven’t moved crypto for years, sometimes over 10 consecutive years, effectively keeping large amounts of crypto out of the market. When whales sell When whales get rid of their crypto, they signal other investors that someone who held millions worth of the asset in question decided that the asset isn’t worth it anymore. And everyone sees it! The whales’ transactions don’t go unnoticed, as thanks to the Bitcoin network’s transparency, these addresses are known, listed, and monitored. Each massive transaction makes headlines and triggers much talk on the Internet. Some people, especially those who don’t follow the trading/investment strategy or even don’t have one, fall for emotions and start to panic. When many people panic simultaneously, they may flip the market or increase the price volatility – not necessarily for a long period, but still. The whales who don’t want to cause disturbance dump their crypto gradually. Most transactions described in the previous chapter seemingly have one goal–the owners move crypto from the legacy Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash (P2PKH) addresses to modern wallets that provide better privacy and security. They cannot be attributed to so-called “whale dumping” that serves as a bearish signal. Alleged market manipulations On Dec. 27, 2024, the “Rich Dad Poor Dad” author, Robert Kiyosaki, took to X to accuse the BlackRock CEO Larry Fink of dumping Bitcoin. According to Kiyosaki, BlackRock is “suppressing Bitcoin price, so the whales can buy Bitcoin at under $100k.” Larry Fink dumping Bitcoin. VIVEK warned Larry Fink of BLACK ROCK is a Marxist. Vivek warned Fink & Black Rock are Share Holder Capitalist not Stake Holder Caplitist. Share Holder Capitalists are Marxist….like Klaus Schwab who state: “Someday you’ll own nothing and you’ll be… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) December 27, 2024 Although we don’t have evidence to support or dispute Kiyosaki’s claim, we must admit that institutions and individuals holding large amounts of crypto are often subjected to such claims. The alleged market manipulation conducted by Tether is one of the best-known cases. The battle for the truth continues as of December 2024. Why would someone accuse whales of intentional price manipulations? First off, whales really can impact the prices. Whales may sell a large amount of BTC, sending the price down, re-buy what was sold during retracement at a discounted price, and enjoy profit made out of the price differences. Other tactics available for whales include rug pulls and wash trading. Ripple Labs admitted having used trading bots in the past. However, it doesn’t outrightly agree with the accusations of using them to manipulate the XRP price. Read more: XRP enthusiast refutes claims of price manipulation by Ripple Crypto whales: friends or foes? Just like the natural whales in the oceans, crypto whales are not friends or foes. Rather, they are large bodies minding their own business. If we know how they impact the market when they spend crypto, we can react to the whale alerts accordingly and avoid trouble. The only exception is the whales consciously manipulating the prices. However, the same means, namely, preparedness and caution, may save us from them too.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,crypto.news,https://crypto.news/crypto-whales-friends-or-foes/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/38342967.jpeg
38342930,https://finbold.com/?p=224538,1735645279,"Crypto trader turns $4.3k into $970,000 in a few hours","As the cryptocurrency industry matures and institutional adoption increases, digital assets, although still volatile, and slowly moving toward being more akin to traditional, buy-and-hold investments. One subsection of the industry, however, is still prone to incredible amounts of volatility, which can see relatively small investments turn into fortunes overnight — or even in the span of a couple of hours. The subsection in question is, to little surprise, meme coins . In one such instance, a savvy trader loaded up on millions of Kekius Maximus (KM), purchased for just a little over $4,000. Quite soon, the trade paid off — in a big and unexpected way. Per data retrieved by Finbold from Solscan on December 31 , the account in question made two transactions, roughly 12 hours before the time of publication. The first saw the purchase of 9.9 million KM worth $2,246 at the time, while the second trade was slightly smaller, encompassing the acquisition of 8.2 million Kekius Maximus for $2,566. All in all, the trader spent $4,360 to purchase 18.15 million KM tokens. The trader’s initial purchases of KM. Source: Solscan A stunt by Elon Musk made Kekius Maximus go parabolic Kekius Maximus is a riff on Pepe The Frog — in this instance, wearing Roman armor as a reference to the movie ‘Gladiator’. While variations of Pepe are quite popular memes and enjoy a lot of staying power, a unique catalyst drove the price surge. Namely, roughly nine hours after the purchase, Elon Musk , the CEO of Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) noted crypto advocate, and owner of social media site X , changed his account name to Kekius Maximus. In short order, KM prices soared by 13,362% — up from just $0.00040 to $0.05385, although prices have since receded to $0.02658. Still, the price of Kekius Maximus is still trading at levels some 6,545% higher than it was before Musk’s show of support KM price 1-day chart. Source: TradingView At the time of writing, the Kekius Maximus held by this address was worth $482,427 — at peak prices, it would have been worth somewhere in the ballpark of $977,377. Naturally, as the trade was so well-timed, X users immediately began speculating whether or not this was a stroke of luck or the action of an insider, perhaps even Musk himself. Unlike most accounts that make such significant profits on meme coins, this address has been making a reasonable number of trades since being opened — meaning that it is unlikely to be an automated system.

38342836,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=376825,1735645190,MicroStrategy Stock Down 36% From November High Despite Continued BTC Accumulation,"Software giant MicroStrategy’s stock has dropped over 36% from its November peak despite its commitment to an aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy. Data from Google Finance shows that MSTR shares closed at $302.96 on December 30 after fluctuating between $301.75 and $320.01 throughout the day. Mounting Bitcoin Holdings Amid Stock Price Struggles The closing price was an 8.19% drop from previous levels, with another 3.19% scrapped off in after-hours trading, pushing the stock to as low as $293.59. However, the biggest dip was observed when comparing MSTR’s highest level of $473.83, achieved on November 20, to its current price, which shows a 36% difference. The all-time high came on the back of MicroStrategy achieving a record $21.8 billion in 24-hour trading volume as it ramped up its BTC accumulation at a time when the asset was breaking price records of its own in quick succession. The company is currently the biggest corporate holder of Bitcoin after securing another 2,136 BTC, bringing its stash to an impressive 446,400 BTC, with an estimated value of $41.4 billion. Nonetheless, the continued buying spree seemed not to have pushed MSTR out of its lethargy, with the stock failing to go beyond $411 in December. That being said, across longer periods, MicroStrategy has still performed admirably. Over six months, it is up more than 121% while also gaining 342% year-to-date. Bitcoin itself has faced a turbulent few weeks, dropping as low as $91,330 shortly after reaching an all-time high of $108,135 on December 17. At the time of writing, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap was trading at $93,800, just 0.1% above its level from yesterday. Across 30 days, it has lost nearly 3% of its value, although over the last 12 months, the price reflects a 121% improvement. Corporate Moves and Market Reactions Interestingly, there seems to be a correlation between MicroStrategy buying BTC and repeated market corrections. Each acquisition, usually announced on a Monday, has triggered a price pullback, raising questions about the firm’s impact on the crypto market. Critics like gold advocate Peter Schiff claim that the company’s purchases are no longer substantial enough to drive the cryptocurrency’s price higher. His comments coincided with BTC shedding 15% from its value, following hawkish signals from the Federal Reserve’s last FOMC meeting. However, led by Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy seems undeterred. Its Bitcoin holdings, bought at an average cost of $62,428, now boast an unrealized profit of over $13 billion. Additionally, a recent announcement about a special shareholders meeting to propose increasing authorized shares and expanding financial options means the Virginia-based entity is preparing for future growth.

Rexas Finance, priced at $0.175 in presale, emerges as a DeFi powerhouse with 10,000% growth potential, outshining Sei and Dogecoin this festive season.

RXS is priced at $0.175 in presale, with potential to increase up to 10,000% while outpacing competitors like Sei and Dogecoin. Its NFT creation and real estate tokenisation via its AI powered solution make it a huge DeFi game changer. Sei wins for speed, Dogecoin for speculative potential and Rexas Finance is the ultimate choice for investors looking to explode this festive season. Sei Blockchain: A game-changer in speed and efficiency Since mainnet has launched, Sei has exploded to become one of the top stand-out blockchains with more than $200 million of Total Value Locked (TVL). Due to the tremendous speed and cost efficiency, it is already outpacing staples like SUI, Solana, as well as Aptos. It’s positioning itself as the leader in blockchain scalability with a roadmap that promises a 50x performance boost, dubbed “Giga Sei.” Furthermore, its EVM compatibility is making it a home to an increasing number of developers who bring development to its ecosystem. Sei, backed by the likes of Circle, Multicoin Capital, and Coinbase Ventures, is making waves by processing over 2,185,747,391 transactions and 343,877 daily active addresses. Sei v2 updates upcoming will make the blockchain a stronger contender amongst others as a top-tier blockchain. Even though it has a market cap of $2 billion, Sei is thought by many to still be undervalued given its rapid adoption. Sei processes over 4 million daily transactions proving itself to be a formidable force in the blockchain space. Dogecoin’s historical patterns signal major upside potential The crypto community is still rooting for Dogecoin as it completes its historic cycle-based price movements. Many analysts track its consistent tendency to break through the 1.618 Fibonacci Extension level in past cycles. Repeating this pattern could mean DOGE hits a dizzying 570% rally to a groundbreaking $2.28 price. Such growth only boosts Dogecoin’s special appeal, both as a speculative asset and as a community phenomenon that makes the former cryptocurrency stand out. The trajectory of cycle three also matches DOGE’s previous explosive growth stages, where there is strong momentum and mass enthusiasm by investors. It also has grassroots support to add to this bullish sentiment as it continues to increase its utility.

Though, it also mentions former Binance CEO CZ and his plans to ‘engage with projects on a personal level.’ In a recent post on the last day of 2024, Binance Labs announced that it will soon be operating under a different name and plans to invest in more projects in 2025, specifically naming crypto, blockchain , AI and Biotech as main areas of focus. Binance Labs will also be expanding its investment scope outside of primary market deals to include other dealings, such as liquidity in secondary markets, and over-the-counter transactions among others. Though, the venture capital arm of Binance ( BNB ) also expects sectors that were “underperforming” in 2024, such as gaming , ZK tech and privacy solutions, will make a comeback in 2025 as they move on to more advanced stages compared to the previous year. In addition, Binance Labs predicts that emerging sectors such as decentralized science, real-world assets, stablecoins and AI agents will continue to perform well in 2025 as these sectors are already poised to develop even further than what they are now. At Binance Labs (soon to be rebranded), we’re laser-focused on fundamentals, aiming for long-term impact. Going into 2025 and beyond, we’ll continue to provide evergreen support to founders who share our vision of building for the long term. As we conclude 2024, let's review the… — Binance Labs Fund (@BinanceLabs) December 31, 2024 In the thread, Binance Labs makes a mention of former Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao being “back in action” and his plans to invest in industry projects on a personal level. “With @CZ_Binance back in action, and spending a large portion of his time on investing in the industry, he is eager to connect with both existing and new founders, and engage with projects on a personal level,” wrote Binance Labs. Although it is not confirmed by Binance Labs, many users took this as a sign that CZ might be returning to the exchange in a less formal setting. However, it is possible the exchange simply alluded to CZ’s involvement in the crypto industry’s emerging sectors, such as AI and Biotech, strengthening their chances of levelling-up in 2025.

38342713,https://crypto.news/?p=14323574,1735644770,Vietnam police dismantle $1m QFS crypto scam claiming ties to ancient treasures,"Authorities in Vietnam have cracked down on a major cryptocurrency scam that defrauded over 400 locals and 100 businesses out of roughly $1.17 million. According to local media, the Hanoi police have apprehended the general director and seven key suspects involved in a cryptocurrency fraud scheme involving the sale of a fake token created and operated by a company whose name translates to “Million Smiles.” The scammers promised exorbitant returns on investments in the Quantum Financial System coin, which they claimed were backed by assets and treasures that were said to have been preserved by ancient family dynasties for hundreds of years. Victims were also lured in with promises of access to an exclusive financial ecosystem, where they would receive capital support for business ventures without the need for collateral or interest payments. Of course, those claims were false, and the QFS coin, as is the case with similar scams , was backed by nothing, the investigation revealed. During a raid on the company’s headquarters, police seized documents, computers, and other evidence, uncovering the extent of the fraud. Police also managed to intervene just before a planned conference with 300 potential investors, preventing the scammers from further promoting the QFS coin and luring in more victims. The scheme targeted individuals with investment amounts ranging from 4–5 million dong (approximately $190) and businesses with demands of up to 39 million dong (around $1,350) per coin.

The illicit funds were used to procure luxurious office spaces in upscale villa areas, creating an illusion of legitimacy to draw in more victims. This was the second major crypto-related bust in Vietnam this quarter. In October, the police took down a major crypto romance scam network that tricked victims into making investments in a fake investing app called “Biconomynft.” Meanwhile, incidents of crypto-related investment fraud made headlines multiple times this year. In January, the Metropolitan Police in the United Kingdom seized over 61,000 Bitcoin from Chinese scammers running dubious schemes. More recently, two UK men were prosecuted for their involvement in a £1.5 million crypto investment scam. Per a Sept. 9 report from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, investment scams accounted for 71% of total losses incurred from crypto-related scams and frauds in 2023. As investment fraud schemes grow increasingly sophisticated and deceptive, it’s more crucial than ever for individuals and businesses to stay informed, exercise caution, and thoroughly investigate opportunities before committing.

38342658,https://coinpedia.org/?p=400422,1735644737,The Next Big Thing: DTX Exchange Makes it to Whales Watchlists Alongside Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Ethereum (ETH),"The post The Next Big Thing: DTX Exchange Makes it to Whales Watchlists Alongside Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Ethereum (ETH) appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market’s next move is expected to be parabolic, sparking a frenzy. On whales’ watchlists are promising tokens, notably top altcoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Ethereum (ETH). DTX Exchange (DTX) is another ERC-20 compatible cryptocurrency on whales’ radars. Its unique offering—a hybrid trading platform—and massive growth prospects make it an investor favorite. At the same time, it is massively undervalued below $0.5. DTX Exchange (DTX): On Whales Watchlists The Ethereum-based altcoin DTX Exchange (DTX) is the latest on whales’ radars. The up-and-coming cryptocurrency stands out for its novel approach to trading—a hybrid exchange protocol—and huge growth prospects. It makes this list alongside Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Ethereum (ETH) but unlike these top crypto coins, it has plenty of room to run. As a low-cap DeFi gem, its upside potential is staggering. Currently priced at $0.14 in the seventh ICO round, it has skyrocketed over 500% in the past months. Another 40% gain is anticipated by the launch date at the estimated price of $0.20. With a projected 70x upswing after debuting on Tier-1 exchanges, it is arguably the best new crypto to invest in. Further, its innovative approach to trading cannot be overemphasized. Unlike conventional trading platforms, it will present the best of CEX and DEX while offering diverse assets across traditional and decentralized finance. This contributes to the rising demand, pushing early funding above $11 million and wallet addresses over 300,000. Shiba Inu (SHIB): How Many Zeros Can It Cancel This Cycle? Shiba Inu (SHIB), the leading memecoin on Ethereum (ETH), is set to be one of the biggest gainers this cycle. It changes hands around $0.000021, with plenty of room to run before retesting its all-time high of $0.00008. Its significant upside potential remains one of its biggest attractions, alongside its budget-friendly price—no need to break the bank before positioning for huge gains. Key technical indicators like the Shiba Inu price trading above the 200-EMA and 200-SMA hint at a bounce in the coming days. At the same time, experts are bullish. CW, a top analyst on X, has $0.000027 as a short-term SHIB price target. Meanwhile, PugaRip, another expert, sees Shiba Inu (SHIB) hitting $0.0003 this cycle. However, for higher ROIs, DTX Exchange (DTX) might be a more compelling option as a low-cap DeFi coin, contributing to the rising demand. Ethereum (ETH): On Whales’ Radars Ethereum (ETH), the leading altcoin, is set for a big jump. It recently reclaimed $3,400, resuming its upward charge. The Ethereum price trading above the 10-SMA ($3,384) and 100-EMA ($3,221) hints at further upswings, positioning it among the altcoins to watch. Crypto analyst FrozenChill predicts the altcoin would hit $10,000 in 2025—about a 3x increase from the current market price. JavonTM1, another top analyst on X, suggests it is poised to climb to $11,865, positioning it among the best cryptos to buy. Despite this, Ethereum (ETH) has limited upside potential, making it less appealing to investors seeking life-changing gains. In contrast, DTX Exchange (DTX), a new DeFi coin, is teeming with potential, tipped for a 70x upswing after listing on Tier-1 exchanges. DTX Exchange (DTX): On Whales Radars Alongside Ethereum (ETH) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) All eyes are on the ETH ecosystem as Q1 2025 begins. Ethereum (ETH), the native utility token; Shiba Inu (SHIB), the leading meme; and DTX Exchange (DTX) , the new hybrid trading protocol, are set to skyrocket. But given DTX’s projected 70x jump, it is a new DeFi project to watch out for.

38342771,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=635367,1735644687,"Tether burned 1B USDT, what does it mean for Bitcoin (BTC) and the crypto market?","Tether burned 1B of USDT supply on the last day of 2024, at the end of a year when record USDT liquidity was injected into the market. The token burn raised questions about the direction of the crypto market. Tether, Inc. burned 1B Tether (USDT), with no explanations on technicalities. The burn decreased the USDT supply from 138B to 137B, arriving after a series of smaller liquidity withdrawals. Tether (USDT) supply climbed for most of 2024 but switched direction in the last weeks after it peaked at 140B. | Source: Coingecko The removal of $1B liquidity followed 10 days of gradually decreasing the supply, causing one of the first supply contractions since 2022. The recent removal of USDT was the biggest single burn for the past week, increasing the rate of reversal of USDT growth for the past year. The leading stablecoin expanded its supply constantly for the past 12 months. The supply of USDT peaked above 140B tokens, becoming one of the supporting factors for the peak Bitcoin (BTC) rally. The recent burn coincided with a market-wide dip, which briefly sent BTC under $93,000. After the recent token burns, the overall supply of stablecoins decreased from its peak of 200.2B, down to 198.5B. The contraction mostly affected USDT, while synthetic or crypto-backed stablecoins grew independently or retained their supply. Tether removes USDT from TRON The recent removal of USDT liquidity affected the tokens on the TRON network. The supply on Ethereum remains at more than 76.9B tokens, while TRON-based TRC-20 stablecoins were burned. Tether Treasury sent out a single transaction to destroy 2B USDT on the TRON network. The burn is part of the policy to move more USDT to its Ethereum version, the most widely used one for both centralized trading and DeFi. On TRON, the supply of USDT is down to 59.75B tokens, spread to more than 58K holders. On-chain analysts noticed some centralized exchanges tried to move out of TRON-based USDT, both through swaps and redemptions, which may be the cause of the token burn. TRON-based USDT is also used for retail and peer-to-peer activities and often carries the most valuable transactions of over $100K. However, whales and exchanges remain more influential than retail. Bitfinex and Binance have attempted redemptions of TRON-based USDT. In the case of Bitfinex, more than 743M USDT were redeemed. The redemptions, swaps or other ways of moving away from TRC-20 stablecoins are still not leading to more mints on Ethereum. TRC-20 USDT is predominantly held by whales in comparison to Ethereum’s stablecoin. More than 85% of all TRON-based stablecoins are in whale wallets or held by exchanges, hence the more coordinated shift to a new type of stablecoin. The rapid divestment of TRC-20 stablecoins led to a short-term loss of the $1 stability, as USDT dipped to $0.9987. The difference is small, but it showed shifting pressures on USDT reserves. Previously, Tether has redeemed and burned tokens from other networks, including TRON, with no major effects on the market. The current shift in holdings may boost Ethereum-based DeFi. The USDT stablecoin is one of the most active smart contracts, producing the biggest daily fees among all chains. Will the Euro area still use USDT? One of the hypotheses for the decreasing USDT supply is the expectation for lowered usage in the European Union after the removal of non-compliant stablecoins. There are already signs that the European market is shifting to compliant stablecoins like USDC. The European market ranks high in terms of crypto activity, although it still lags behind the USA. The upcoming regulation of USDT may further slow down usage and innovation, with the rationale of higher security. Tether, Inc. is yet to acquire a license for EU-based banking, to provide the requisite reserves for making USDT compliant. EU-based services still swapped the token, but exchanges like Binance may remove some of its products and trading pairs, especially if using leveraged positions. USDT remained one of the most widely used assets, and Tether may yet produce a compliant version of the token. The 2024 bull market led Tether to achieve $2.55B in annual fees, based on the token’s daily usage.

The decision, made on December 31, follows Yoon’s suspension from office after his controversial attempt to impose martial law earlier this month. This marks the first time a sitting South Korean president has faced such legal action, underscoring the severity of the political crisis gripping the nation. Political and Market Chaos President Yoon’s announcement of martial law on December 3 during a televised address stunned the nation. Justifying the move as necessary to eliminate “anti-state elements” and address perceived threats from North Korea , the action was met with swift backlash. Within hours, South Korea’s parliament intervened, leading to Yoon’s impeachment on December 14. Yoon’s declaration of martial law also triggered turmoil in the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin prices on South Korean exchanges like UpBit plummeted by as much as $30,000 in just six hours. The steep decline was attributed to a liquidity crisis exacerbated by the sudden disappearance of key market players. Globally, major cryptocurrencies, including Ether and XRP, saw declines of up to 4%, reflecting international investor jitters over South Korea’s escalating political instability. The crypto market rebounded once parliament forced Yoon to lift martial law on December 4. However, the event left lasting impressions on both domestic and global traders, highlighting the interconnectedness of political and financial systems. Leadership Transition in South Korea The arrest warrant, approved after Yoon failed to attend three investigative hearings, was requested by a joint task force comprising South Korea’s National Police Agency, Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials (CIO), and the Defense Ministry’s Criminal Investigation Command. The warrant, valid for seven days, could be extended if necessary. In the interim, Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok has assumed the role of acting president, tasked with steering the nation through a turbulent period. Yoon’s attempt to impose martial law came on the heels of a record-breaking day for retail crypto trading in South Korea . High-momentum altcoins like XRP, Dogecoin, and Stellar were dominating the market just before the announcement, illustrating the volatility that can arise when political events intersect with financial markets.

Also, the daily Long/Short ratio nears 1, currently at 0.994. That shows more traders opening longs, reflecting confidence in alt’s trends. Meanwhile, Elon Musk has been a prominent figure in the crypto space over the past years. He established his name in the market after propelling Dogecoin to all-time highs with a series of posts on X in 2021. The Dogefather even hinted at integrating DOGE for Tesla merchandise and facilitating X payments. Musk briefly switched his Twitter blue bird logo with a Dogecoin mascot in 2023 – after purchasing the social media platform and rebranding it to X. Furthermore, Musk has posted PEPE-linked characters in the past. For instance, Musk retweeted a generated photo of Kekius Maximus on December 10. Meme crypto market outlook Themed digital coins display resilience amidst the ongoing broad market sell-offs. CoinGecko data shows meme market cap increased by 2.4% within the past day to $108 billion. Moreover, the $13.62 billion 24-hour trading volume confirms robust interest in the asset class’s prevailing performance.

That suggests confidence in the alt’s future performance. Further, the original meme token Dogecoin sees magnified whale activity. Whale Alert highlighted an address that transferred DOGE worth over $149 million. Moreover, another large-scale investor moved 350 million tokens yesterday.

38351041,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=107040,1735644196,Trillion-Dollar Asset Manager Identifies 3 Key Crypto Themes to Watch in 2025,"After a whirlwind year in 2024, crypto market participants are setting their sights on 2025, wondering what the new year may hold for the asset class. Amid the questions and the speculation, leading asset manager Franklin Templeton has offered three themes for investors to watch in the new year.Franklin Templeton's 2025 Crypto Outlook$1.68 trillion asset manager Franklin Templeton has offered its crypto outlook for 2025. In the outlook shared on Monday, December 30, the firm identified three themes for investors to watch. These themes include regulations, institutional adoption, and AI-crypto convergence.Regulatory Clarity ComingFranklin Templeton tipped 2025 to usher in regulatory clarity for crypto, with U.S. regulators like the SEC leading the way. These sentiments come in light of the incoming Donald Trump administration's anticipated pro-crypto policy leanings and the imminent change of the SEC guard. Trump has nominated Paul Atkins, who is widely known as a crypto advocate, for the SEC's chairman.Under clearer regulatory skies, Franklin Templeton expects to see the approval of more diversified crypto-focused funds. Other asset managers already appear to be banking on this trend. Strive has recently submitted an application to launch a Bitcoin Bond ETF. On the other hand, Bitwise has filed to launch a Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF.Franklin Templeton expects this regulatory climate to unlock new levels of institutional integration with crypto.Tokenization and StablecoinsWith more explicit guidance from the SEC, Franklin Templeton expects to see more tokenized security products from traditional finance institutions.The asset manager also expects these institutions to take a stab at the stablecoin market as market participants anticipate a stablecoin regulatory framework from lawmakers. Notably, this trend is already observable in the European Union . Following the passing of MiCA, ventures tied to banking giants like Societe Generale, Deutsche Bank, and BBVA are already throwing their hats in the ring to launch Euro-backed stablecoins.Franklin Templeton contends that this greater institutional adoption in the form of tokenization and stablecoin development will be major drivers for DeFi in 2025.AI and CryptoBeyond regulatory clarity ushering greater institutional adoption, Franklin Templeton tips 2025 to be a year of accelerated AI and crypto convergence. The asset manager argues that blockchain technology will be key in expanding the ""AI-driven economy"" by offering transparency and verifiability.Moreover, the firm expects the adoption of AI agents to grow in the automation of on-chain transactions and portfolio management.Amid all these, Franklin Templeton predicts that Bitcoin will cement its place as a global store of value, with several countries and companies establishing strategic reserves.The firm also expects heightened demand for decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePINs) as logistics and Internet of Things (IoT) industries seek greater efficiency.https://twitter.com/FTDA_US/status/1873815878246261149",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/31/trillion-dollar-asset-manager-identifies-3-key-crypto-themes-to-watch-in-2025/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=trillion-dollar-asset-manager-identifies-3-key-crypto-themes-to-watch-in-2025,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

38342176,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/bitcoin-btc-volatility-high-breakout-is-imminent,1735643614,Bitcoin ($BTC) volatility high - breakout is imminent,"Bitcoin ($BTC) is approaching the next decision point and volatility is high as bulls and bears battle to send the next big move either up or down. Patience is required Where Bitcoin goes next is in the lap of the Gods. The inauguration of the new Trump administration in the US is still a month away, and the huge boost that this can bring to the crypto industry is still to come. Therefore, it may well be that in the intervening time all manner of price manipulation could be brought to bear on Bitcoin. Back down at around $70,000 is an area where significant leverage could be liquidated, while at $100,000 and above, the same is true. It might not be beyond market makers to liquidate both sets of traders. All this said, for those with the capacity and the patience to wait it out, there could be a lot more upside to come as nation states are forced to enter the race for Bitcoin given the parlous state of their own fiat currencies. Economic mismanagement In the UK, the Prime Minister Keir Starmer recently asked industry regulators to come up with a plan to grow the economy . The fact that regulators generally do the opposite, by reining in businesses and forcing all sorts of compliance requirements on them, points to a total lack of understanding by Starmer on how to go about managing the UK economy. Regulations generally have the effect of suppressing the private sector, from where the vast bulk of economic activity is likely to come, and this is a problem not just in the UK, but across the whole of Europe. It is to be hoped that the UK and European governments will realise this before their economies are driven too far into the dust. Also, if the US does go ahead with setting up a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, Europe will need to enter this particular arms race or face being completely left behind by nation states that do understand the importance of accumulating Bitcoin. The whole financial world is in the process of being turned upon its head, and what was accepted financial wisdom only a very short time ago, is being proven to not cut it in today’s new digital age. Seesaw volatility Source: TradingView The short-term price chart for $BTC shows that a fake-out to the downside was bought back up again by the bulls. Seesaw moves both up and down in short periods of time totalled as much as $3,000 each one. That said, as volatility rises, volume is declining. This could presage a number of outcomes. It might just be that the major buyers are leaving well alone for the time being, in anticipation of tax sell-offs and many other business-related reasons, which could lead to the price going sideways or even downwards for a period of time. On the other hand, declining volume could augur a sudden big move in either direction as the price coils up ready for a major spike. Weekly MACD nears decision time Source: TradingView The weekly chart for $BTC demonstrates that the price is still maintaining above the ascending trendline. Also, the red candles are diminishing in size as they come down. If this week’s candle can close above the ascending trendline and even end in the green, this would be a real positive for the bulls going forward. At the bottom of the chart, the MACD is currently showing that the blue indicator line is slightly bending downward. This will need to change in order to avoid a crossdown below the orange line and a subsequent period of down movement. Also, the histogram bars are still light green and declining in size. They will need to start rising again in order to see a continuation of this bull market. Although, another period of sideways or downwards price action that takes the price all the way back to $70,000 must not be discounted.

38342079,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/?p=27418,1735643460,Grayscale Adds AI and DeFi Tokens to Q1 2025 Watch List,"Grayscale has expanded its top 20 tokens to watch for Q1 2025, adding tokens from artificial intelligence platforms and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, according to a Dec. 30 research note. The updated list now includes Hyperliquid (HYPE), Ethena (ENA), Virtuals (VIRTUAL), Jupiter (JUP), Jito (JTO), and Grass (GRASS). Grayscale highlighted three key industry trends behind the additions: a friendlier U.S. regulatory environment, advancements in decentralized AI, and growth in the Solana ecosystem. Virtuals and Grass are AI platforms, Hyperliquid is a high-performance layer-1 (L1) network, and Ethena, Jupiter, and Jito are DeFi applications. Both Jupiter and Jito are native to the Solana blockchain. “In addition to the new themes, we continue to be excited about themes from previous quarters such as Ethereum scaling solutions, tokenization, and decentralized physical infrastructure (DePIN),” Grayscale said. Grayscale continues to feature tokens like Optimism (OP), Chainlink (LINK), and Helium (HNT) to represent these ongoing themes. The firm noted that smart contract platforms — including Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), and Sui (SUI) — remain among the most competitive segments in the digital assets industry. Grayscale attributed Ethereum’s underperformance in 2024 partly to the rise of alternative L1 blockchain networks. Industry Trends Cryptocurrencies saw significant gains following Donald Trump’s election victory, as his administration is expected to adopt crypto-friendly policies. Trump has pledged to appoint leaders supportive of the industry to regulatory agencies and make the U.S. “the world’s crypto capital.” Raj Brahmbhatt, CEO of Web3 settlement firm Zeebu, said, “In the US, with Trump’s victory, I am aggressively bullish on the US becoming a global leader in the space by the end of the year.” DeFi on Solana is particularly well-positioned, with total value locked rising from $1.5 billion in January to nearly $8.5 billion in December, per DefiLlama. Jito, a Solana staking pool, reported over $100 million in monthly revenue from priority fees and tips in November and December. AI is also expected to play a larger role in decentralized communities, with applications in staking and onchain trading, according to J.D.

With a unique ecosystem designed to attract millions of crypto enthusiasts, this token combines entertainment, innovation, and market-defying ambition.

Solana continues to soar Solana is a blockchain platform that’s all about speed and scalability. It’s a place where decentralized applications, or dapps, can thrive. Unlike some of its competitors like Ethereum and Cardano, Solana focuses on high transaction speeds. Its design choices aim for quicker transactions and offer developers flexibility with multiple programming languages. At the heart of Solana is SOL, its native cryptocurrency. SOL powers the network, helps run custom programs, and rewards those who support the system. Currently valued at $194.32, SOL has experienced a 2% rise over the last week, driven by public interest. The market cap now sits at $93b, with trading volume reaching $3.49b. Sentiment indicators suggest bearish momentum as investors watch key support and resistance levels at $170 and $250.

As the market watches closely, this combination of technical signals and price action could set the stage for XRP’s next major move. $1.9 Support Role In XRP Price Action The $1.9 support level has emerged as a pivotal zone for XRP, acting as a foundation for its price stability amid ongoing market turbulence. Support levels are essential in technical analysis, serving as points where buying pressure is typically strong enough to halt or reverse a downtrend. For XRP, the $1.9 level represents a psychological threshold and holds significant historical importance in its price action.

Traders and investors often view such critical support zones as opportunities for entry, anticipating a possible bounce that might lead to upward momentum. However, its role extends beyond just being a price floor. It also serves as an indicator of market sentiment and the balance of power between bulls and bears. Currently, as XRP approaches this key level, the question remains whether it can sustain the buying interest needed to spark a recovery. A successful defense of the $1.9 support would reaffirm its strength and likely attract fresh buying pressure, setting the stage for a rally toward higher resistance levels. However, a breach of this critical support could signal a shift in momentum, leading to more declines and triggering stop-loss orders from traders, which may accelerate the downward move. The Bigger Picture: What Current Setup Means For Its Future XRP’s current technical setup offers crucial insights into its next potential direction. The $1.9 support level is a key zone, with oversold signals suggesting a rebound. If this support level holds, it is likely to restore bullish confidence, sparking an upward movement toward the $2.9 resistance level and beyond.

This happened as Elon Musk changed his personal X account’s name to Kekius Maximus, pumping the memecoin, benefiting early buyers. The anonymous trader uses the wallet address 0x33a57f4e88c9ceb0788eb41a407e51533d70cc4d , as spotted by Spot On Chain this Tuesday morning. According to the onchain analyst, the trader ‘0x33A’ bought 8.448 million KEKIUS with 16 ETH , then worth $54,800. These purchases happened between December 19 and stopped approximately 18 hours before Elon Musk’s activity that would change everything. Notably, Musk changed his personal account name to Kekius Maximum just three hours before Spot On Chain ’s post. This, now controversial decision, has drawn the market’s attention to KEKIUS, bringing massive returns to early buyers like ‘0x33A’. In particular, KEKIUS surges by 980% with Elon Musk’s trick, rewarding the trader with $950,000 of unrealized profits. 0x33a57f4e88c9ceb0788eb41a407e51533d70cc4d KEKIUS purchases & Kekius Maximums (@elonmusk). Source: Spot On Chain / X Memecoins and the greater fool theory On Finbold, we have reported other cases of impressive profits acquired by trading meme coins. An anonymous trader turned $368 into $2 million in three days , for example, while another speculator achieved a remarkable 3,329-fold return . Yet, meme coins have characteristics that resemble financial bubbles, which traders should be aware of. The “Greater Fool Theory” explains the dynamics seen on these speculative tokens, moved primarily by social hype and buzz without any organic demand. Traders buy the token with the expectation that a “greater fool” will pay a higher price in the future. Nevertheless, the scheme fades away once there are no “greater fools” to continue fueling the price up, often facing liquidity issues and death spirals. Moreover, most of the recently launched memecoins are financial schemes known as rug pulls, created to extract retail’s liquidity . Interestingly, “smart traders” or insiders can take advantage of the “greater fools” by creating and promoting meme coins. They benefit from information asymmetry and the hype of a market that insists on gambling, following influential figures like Musk. Previously, Binance’s Changpeng Zhao (CZ) has criticized these dynamics, as Finbold reported in late November. According to his post , CZ is “not against memes” but acknowledges that “meme coins are getting ‘a little’ weird now.” Featured image from Shutterstock.

From the groundbreaking approvals of Bitcoin and Ethereum Spot ETFs to the explosive growth of the global crypto market, this year has seen it all. The global crypto market cap has surged from $1.61 trillion to $3.17 trillion, a 96.89% increase.

The last quarter of 2024 has been particularly remarkable. From the shift in U.S. politics favoring cryptocurrency following Donald Trump’s presidential victory, to Bitcoin hitting the $100K milestone , the crypto world has seen several significant events. What does all this mean for global crypto adoption? Let’s explore. Global Crypto Ownership: A Closer Look A recent report reveals that there are now at least 560 million cryptocurrency owners worldwide. Men make up nearly 61% of these owners, while women account for around 39%. Notably, 34% of crypto owners are young people aged 25 to 34, highlighting the growing appeal of digital assets among younger generations.

Other major countries in the Top 20 include Vietnam, Ukraine, Russia, the Philippines, Pakistan, Brazil, Turkey, the UK, Venezuela, Mexico, Argentina, Thailand, Cambodia, Canada, South Korea, and China. Understanding the Global Crypto Adoption Index The index is based on four key sub-indexes: Crypto Value Received Index Retail Crypto Activity Index DeFi Adoption Index Retail DeFi Activity Index Top Countries for Crypto Value Received: Ranked by Economic Impact This sub-index measures the value of cryptocurrency received by centralized services in each country, adjusted for average income. India ranks first, followed by the United States and Vietnam in second and third. Pakistan, Nigeria, and Indonesia round out the top six. Top Countries in Retail Crypto Activity Adjusted for Income This sub-index focuses on how much cryptocurrency value is received in smaller, retail transactions (under $10,000) at centralised services, adjusted for how wealthy a country’s population is. Countries with significant retail transaction activity relative to their population’s average income rank higher. India also tops this index list. Nigeria follows closely. Vietnam and Pakistan are in the third and fourth positions, respectively. Ukraine remains in the fifth position on the list. Surprisingly, the United States stays in the twelfth position. Top Countries in DeFi Adoption Adjusted for Income The sub-index evaluates how much crypto value is being transacted through DeFi protocols in each country, while considering the country’s average income level. Countries with lower average income but significant DeFi activity are ranked higher. In this list, Indonesia is in the first position. Nigeria and India follow. The United States stays in the fourth position on the list. Ukraine is in fifth, and Vietnam in seventh. Top Countries in Retail DeFi Activity Adjusted for Income The sub-index considers how much cryptocurrency value is transacted through DeFi protocols in smaller, retail-sized transfers (under $10,000), adjusted for the income levels of different countries. Countries with lower average income but significant retail DeFi activity are ranked higher. In this list also, Indonesia remains in the topmost position, India stays in the second position, Nigeria in the third position. The United States stands at the fourth position on the list. Vietnam is in fifth, and Ukraine in sixth. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Top 10 Celebrities Holding Bitcoin: Who’s Leading the Way in Crypto Investments? , US Crypto Adoption: An Overview Cryptocurrency adoption in the United States has seen impressive growth.

38341729,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=635356,1735642184,NYSE and Nasdaq to close shop on January 9,"In honor of the late President Jimmy Carter, the US stock market will close on January 9 for a national day of mourning. The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Nasdaq Inc. have confirmed the suspension of trading on their US stock exchanges. The CME Group Inc., the operator of US-based equity and interest rate markets, and CBOE Global Markets Inc. have yet to disclose their plans. The decision aligns with a long-standing tradition of halting financial operations following the death of a US president. President Carter, who passed away on December 29 at the age of 100, was the longest-living president in US history. The most recent comparable closure occurred on December 5, 2018, for the funeral of President George H.W. Bush. NYSE, Nasdaq to close Jan. 9 for national day of mourning following death of Jimmy Carter https://t.co/a2sVxzDhfW — FOX Business (@FoxBusiness) December 31, 2024 NYSE Group President Lynn Martin reflected on Carter’s legacy in a statement, saying, “ Jimmy Carter, with humble roots as a farmer and family man, devoted his life to public service and defending our freedom…The NYSE will respectfully honor President Carter’s lifetime of service to our nation by closing our markets on the National Day of Mourning. ” Lynn Martin added that the NYSE will also fly the US flag at half-staff throughout the mourning period. Market interruptions are symbolic According to a recent Bloomberg report, economists believe market closures , although infrequent, are an imperative symbolic gesture during moments of national significance. Financial institutions have historically paused operations for events such as natural disasters, national emergencies, and pivotal historical events, including the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, and the Wall Street bombing of 1920. Market participants emphasize that these pauses, though significant, typically have minimal long-term effects on trading or the broader economy. Following the one-day closure, markets are expected to resume normal volumes and liquidity. “Business Day” of mourning is a US tradition The tradition of suspending trading following a president’s death dates back to the assassination of Abraham Lincoln in 1865. At the time, the New York Times described the news as creating “a sensation of horror and of agony which no other event in our history has ever excited,” with businesses halting operations as citizens gathered in mourning. Such closures serve as both a practical and symbolic pause, allowing the nation to reflect on the contributions of its leaders. In Carter’s case, his humble beginnings as a farmer and family man, combined with his dedication to public service and humanitarian efforts, have left an indelible mark on the nation. Although markets rarely shut down, the death of a president remains an exception. Past closures for events like 9/11 highlighted the necessity of such pauses to maintain stability and avoid financial panic. “ The markets were right to shut down and just avoid financial panic, ” said Ed Yardeni, a veteran market analyst, referencing the September 11 attacks. “ Nobody really knew whether there would be more attacks .” For January 9, the closure stands as a testament to the enduring connection between Wall Street and moments of national reflection.

38343282,https://cryptonews.com/?p=323629,1735642162,Binance Labs Plans to Rebrand in 2025 With CZ Engaging More,"Cryptocurrency exchange Binance’s venture capital arm spin-off Binance Labs has announced plans to rebrand in 2025. Changpeng Zhao (CZ) will lead and personally engage with investment projects. Binance Labs broke away from the exchange and became an independent entity earlier this year. The rebranding reflects its evolving vision and to distance itself from the exchange. At Binance Labs (soon to be rebranded), we’re laser-focused on fundamentals, aiming for long-term impact. Going into 2025 and beyond, we’ll continue to provide evergreen support to founders who share our vision of building for the long term. As we conclude 2024, let's review the… — Binance Labs Fund (@BinanceLabs) December 31, 2024 CZ Back in Action The investment arm said former Binance founder CZ will dedicate more time to investing and directly engaging with projects. CZ is permanently banned from being involved in Binance leadership but is allowed to focus on investments. CZ served four months in prison for violating the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act and other regulatory issues. With CZ dedicating more time to investing and directly engaging with projects, Binance Labs said it is also expanding its investment strategy to include secondary markets, OTC deals, and other opportunities. With @CZ_Binance back in action, and spending a large portion of his time on investing in the industry, he is eager to connect with both existing and new founders, and engage with projects on a personal level. — Binance Labs Fund (@BinanceLabs) December 31, 2024 Looking Back … Looking back at 2024, Binance Labs said it has had a remarkable year, investing in 46 projects. Of these, 14 were sourced from the BNB Chain-focused MVB program and the chain-agnostic Labs Incubation program, while 32 were direct investments. These investments spanned a variety of sectors, with an even 50-50 split between infrastructure and application-focused deals. In a breakdown, the firm said its portfolio is diverse, with investments in DeFi X10 projects, AI X7, the Bitcoin ecosystem X7, Re-staking X4, Gaming X3, ZK technologies X2, RWAs X2, and consumer apps X2. Emerging fields like the “Move” system and decentralized science (DeSci) also gained more attention. The firm invests in major platforms like Solana, Ethereum, and Ethereum Layer 2 solutions, as well as Berachain, and Monad. Binance Labs said 20% of these investments were in projects within the BNB ecosystem. Looking Forward …. Binance Labs said as the industry transitions into 2025, it is optimistic about the opportunities that lie ahead. With the pro-crypto stance of the incoming Trump administration, the regulatory landscape is expected to become more favourable, potentially boosting institutional interest and setting the stage for industry maturation. In 2025, Binance Labs said it will focus on key areas such as blockchain/crypto, AI, and biotech, as well as innovations at the intersection of these domains. Underperforming sectors like gaming and privacy solutions may see a resurgence as they move from development to production.

BTC is trading at $92,317, down almost 1.33% in the past 24 hours. Market watchers and traders expecting a bullish end to the year in which BTC remains above $100,000 were left disappointed by recent performances, as it failed to maintain momentum and end the year on a bullish note. Almost all cryptocurrencies are in the red as the year draws to a close, with Ethereum (ETH) down nearly 2% and Ripple (XRP) down almost 5%. Solana (SOL) is down just over 1%, while Dogecoin (DOGE) is down 2.40%. Cardano (ADA), Tron (TRX) , Avalanche (AVAX), Toncoin (TON), Chainlink (LINK) , Hedera (HBAR), Polkadot (DOT), and Stellar (XLM) also reported substantial losses. The crypto market cap is down almost 2% and currently sits at $3.23 trillion. A Look Ahead The crypto market experienced unprecedented growth and adoption in 2024. It also saw record capital inflows from institutional buyers, pushing prices higher. The approval and launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs and Donald Trump’s election victory propelled Bitcoin (BTC) past the $100,000 milestone, as it set a new all-time high of $108,268, proving its value does not have a ceiling. Market experts believe BTC’s bull run could continue in 2025, and possibly spill over to major altcoins as the market matures. 2024 also had several key narratives like meme coins and AI tokens. According to analysts, both sectors are set for further interest from market participants. In a report published by Bitwise, analysts also predict the Real World Asset (RWA) sector will cross $50 billion in 2025. According to the report, tokenized RWAs accounted for less than $2 billion three years ago. Venture capital firm ParaFi has also aligned its predictions with Bitwise, stating the RWA market could grow to $2 trillion by 2030. Edward Mata, CEO and co-founder of Brickken said in an interview, “RWA is going to matter a lot to key players. Big players like BlackRock and JP Morgan are jumping in to provide just what we need for the RWA space to matter. I see AI agents embedded in the process. Bitcoin as a treasury could be cemented in different countries. From the technological point of view: RWA and AI agents are two key narratives for the coming year.” Meanwhile, meme coins have been one of the best-performing assets of 2024, with the trend set to continue in 2025. Dario Lo Buglio, Chief Technology Officer at Brickken stated, “Meme coins could fade away with some time or experience some growth next year. Maybe it can find a place for itself in the market. It is a trend, we welcome trends and embrace them.” Markets End Year In The Red Ripple (XRP) led losses in crypto as it dropped by 5% thanks to a stronger dollar that weighed down on global assets, including Bitcoin (BTC). Several other altcoins also reported losses, with Dogecoin (DOGE), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL) registering declines between 2% and 3%. US equities also registered a sharp decline as investors trimmed their positions amid growing uncertainty heading into the new year. BTC has historically moved in the opposite direction of the US Dollar Index. The Dollar strengthened ahead of Donald Trump’s inauguration in late January, with the President-elect promising several policies to help the economy. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC)’s extended decline continued as it slipped below $93,000 on Monday, with the asset struggling to build momentum. BTC’s decline comes after the Federal Reserve’s hawkish comments about a Bitcoin strategic reserve and weaker-than-expected inflation forecast for 2025. While the Fed implemented an anticipated rate cut of 25 basis points, it predicted only two rate cuts in 2025 against the expected four, dampening investor enthusiasm. BTC’s drop to a low of $91,268 marks a 15% decline from its all-time high earlier this month, with technical indicators predicting a further decline. BTC declined despite MicroStrategy acquiring another batch of 2,138 BTC to bring its total holdings to 446,400 BTC. Tether also added to its BTC holdings, purchasing 7,630 BTC to bring the value of its holdings to $7.7 billion. Others, including Marathon Digital and Riot Platforms, have also added to their reserves. BTC’s decline can be attributed to profit-taking by investors taking profits around the $100,000 level. Worryingly for traders, BTC seems to be trading on a downward trajectory, having formed a head and shoulders pattern, typically associated with a bearish reversal. After surging to an all-time high on December 17, BTC declined rapidly. By December 20, it dropped to an intraday low of $92,072 before recovering to settle at $98,124. However, sellers remained in control as BTC dipped to 95,303 at the end of the previous weekend. BTC remained in the red as it started the previous week with a drop of 0.50%, going below $95,000 and settling at $94,830. However, it recovered on Tuesday, rising over 4% and moving to $98,677. BTC continued to push higher but could not go above the 20-day SMA and ultimately settled at $99,409 after an increase of 0.74%. Source: TradingView With sellers active at this level, BTC registered a sharp drop on Thursday, falling almost 4% to $95,691. BTC slipped below the 50-day SMA on Friday after registering a fall of 1.52% and settling at $94,241. The weekend began with the price registering an increase of almost 1%. However, it was back in the red on Sunday, dropping nearly 2% and settling at $93,475. BTC continued to fall on Monday as sellers dragged the price below $93,000 after a drop of almost 1%. The current session sees BTC marginally down as buyers and sellers struggle to establish control. If BTC drops below $92,000, it could go as low as $90,000. However, some technical indicators suggest a drop of almost 20% is on the cards. If that happens, the price could go well below $80,000. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) is trading sideways between $3,200 and $3,500 as it struggles to go above the 50-day SMA. ETH briefly dipped below the 50-day SMA on Friday (December 20) when sellers dragged the price to a low of $3,096. However, it recovered from this level to register an increase of 1.62% and settled at $3,470. Sellers established control over the weekend as ETH fell below the 50-day SMA on Saturday, dropping to $3,337. Sellers retained control on Sunday as ETH dropped almost 2% and settled at $3,279. The price recovered on Monday, registering an increase of 4.27% and settling at $3,419, and continued to push higher on Tuesday, going above the 50-day SMA and settling at $3,491. Source: TradingView With sellers active at this level, ETH could only register a marginal increase on Wednesday as buyers lost momentum. Sellers took control on Thursday as the price fell by 4.62%, going below the 50-day SMA and settling at $3,333. Buyers attempted a recovery on Friday but were unsuccessful, with ETH ultimately registering a marginal decline. Buyers took control on Saturday as ETH registered an increase of just over 2% and settled at $3,402. However, ETH was back in the red on Sunday, dropping 1.46% to $3,352. The current week began with a marginal increase and a jump in volatility. However, the price is back in the red during the ongoing session, trading around $3,343. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) dropped below $200 on December 19, falling to $193 after dropping just over 6%. It fell to a low of $175 the following day before recovering to settle at $194. The following weekend saw SOL continue declining, dropping almost 7% on Saturday and 0.55% on Sunday to settle at $180. Despite the strong bearish sentiment, SOL started the previous week on a positive note, rising by 5.30% on Monday to settle at $189. The price continued to push higher on Tuesday, moving to $197 after an increase of almost 4%. With sellers active for around $200, SOL could only register a marginal rise on Wednesday. With buyers losing momentum, SOL was back in the red on Thursday, dropping 4.57% to $188. Source: TradingView Sellers retained control on Friday as SOL dropped to $184 after a failed recovery. However, it registered an increase of over 6% on Saturday and moved to $195 before falling back in the red on Sunday and ending the weekend at $189. SOL experienced considerable volatility on Monday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Buyers ultimately gained the upper hand as SOL rose by 0.72% and settled at $191. The current session sees SOL down by 1.33% and trading around $188. If selling pressure persists, SOL could drop to $180. Stellar (XLM) Price Analysis Stellar (XLM) started the previous week positively as buyers attempted to reverse its recent bearish sentiment. With buyers in control, XLM registered an increase of almost 4% on Monday as it rebounded from the 50-day SMA to settle at $0.370. Bullish sentiment increased on Tuesday as XLM surged nearly 9% to $0.402 as buyers looked to push above the 20-day SMA. However, XLM lost momentum after reaching this level, dropping just over 5% on Wednesday and settling at $0.382. Sellers retained control on Thursday as XLM slipped below the 50-day SMA after falling over 7% and settling at $0.355. Source: TradingView XLM continued to drop on Friday, dropping 1.56% to $0.349. The weekend began with a recovery as XLM rose almost 2% on Saturday and settled at $0.356. However, it was back in the red on Sunday, dropping over 5% and settling at $0.338. The current week began with sellers retaining control as XLM dropped almost 2% to $0.331. The current session sees the price marginally down and trading around $0.328. Cardano (ADA) Price Analysis Cardano (ADA) fell below $0.90 last weekend, falling to $0.883 on Sunday. However, it rebounded from the 50-day SMA on Monday, registering an increase of almost 5% and settling at $0.926. Buyers retained control on Tuesday as ADA registered a marginal increase and moved to $0.936. However, markets turned bearish on Wednesday, as the price fell just over 2% to $0.916. Thursday saw ADA slip below $0.90 and the 50-day SMA to settle at $0.861 after dropping 6%. Source: TradingView Buyers returned to the market on Friday as ADA rose to an intraday high of $0.913 before ultimately settling at $0.876, an increase of almost 2%. ADA remained positive on Saturday, rising 1.48% and settling at $0.889. However, it was back in the red on Sunday, dropping 3.37% and settling at $0.859. The current week began with ADA experiencing considerable volatility as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Buyers ultimately gained the upper hand but could only register a marginal increase as ADA rose to $0.862. However, ADA is back in the red during the ongoing session, with the price down almost 2%. Aptos (APT) Price Analysis Aptos (APT) experienced a significant decline that dragged its price from $14.55 to a low of $8.88 at the beginning of the previous week. APT recovered from this level to register an increase of 5.36% and settle at $9.71. Sellers attempted to drag APT below $9 as it fell to an intraday low of $9.26 on Tuesday. APT recovered from this level to register an increase of $1.08% and settle at $9.81. APT encountered resistance around $10 as selling pressure weighed the price down. As a result, APT fell into the red on Wednesday, dropping almost 3% and settling at $9.54. Source: TradingView Bearish sentiment intensified substantially on Thursday as APT fell almost 8% to go below the $9 support level and settle at $8.80.

Ai16z, the agentic artificial intelligence platform, is exploring the launch of its own layer-1 blockchain, signaling a bold step to integrate AI-driven tokenomics into the blockchain ecosystem. Meanwhile, Seraphim Czecker, the influential head of growth at Ethena, has announced his resignation following the protocol’s meteoric rise to the fourth-largest stablecoin by market capitalization. Ai16z Eyes Layer-1 Blockchain for AI, Tokenomics Overhaul Ai16z, an agentic artificial intelligence platform, is exploring the launch of its own layer-1 (L1) blockchain network. This initiative forms part of a larger plan to reshape its tokenomics framework, according to a recent governance forum post . The announcement suggests that ai16z could become the backbone for AI applications within the blockchain ecosystem, combining decentralized technology with artificial intelligence to drive token value and innovation. At the heart of ai16z’s vision lies an AI agent launchpad akin to platforms like Pump.fun. The project aims to establish the launchpad as the centerpiece of its tokenomics strategy. Contributors have outlined several mechanisms designed to amplify the utility and value of the platform’s native token, $ai16z: A percentage of fees from agent launches would be funneled into the platform. Holding $ai16z would become a prerequisite for participating in agent allocations. The token would play a pivotal role in initial agent offerings. Liquidity pools pairing $ai16z with agent-specific tokens would incentivize deeper market integration. These measures are envisioned to create a self-sustaining economic loop, or ”flywheel,” driving continuous value to the $ai16z token. The proposed L1 blockchain, built with open-source architecture and incentivized nodes, would use $ai16z as its base currency, further embedding the token into the ecosystem. Launched in October, ai16z has already established itself as a disruptive force in the blockchain and AI sectors. The $ai16z token boasts a market capitalization nearing $1.5 billion, according to CoinGecko. The platform operates as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), led by AI agents powered by its flagship AI operating system, Eliza . Eliza is described as a sophisticated intelligence capable of leveraging collective decision-making for investment purposes. Within a short span, ai16z has: Managed an on-chain liquidity pool with annualized returns of approximately 25%, according to data from Daos.fun. Supported a growing ecosystem of over a dozen Eliza-powered Web3 AI agents, as tracked by the community dashboard, Elizas.world. These agents are already engaged in various on-chain activities, generating millions of dollars weekly, according to a report by VanEck. Web3 AI: The Broader Landscape The integration of AI agents into blockchain networks is rapidly gaining momentum. As of December, an estimated 10,000 AI agents are active across various blockchains, with projections suggesting that this number will soar to 1 million by the end of 2025. In 2024 alone, tokens tied to agentic AI have surged in market capitalization, reaching a collective valuation of $10 billion, largely driven by Q4 activity. Ai16z’s ambitions signal a broader trend of convergence between blockchain technology and artificial intelligence. The proposed layer-1 blockchain would serve as a dedicated infrastructure for AI agents, potentially establishing ai16z as a leader in this emerging field. The use of $ai16z as the ecosystem’s base currency would further cement its role in the broader Web3 landscape, while the AI agent launchpad could attract developers and projects seeking innovative ways to deploy intelligent agents. As 2025 approaches, the year predicted to be transformative for AI agents, ai16z appears poised to capitalize on its early success, leveraging its Eliza operating system and innovative tokenomics to redefine the intersection of AI and blockchain technology. Ethena’s Head of Growth, Seraphim Czecker, Steps Down Amid Strategic Evolution In other news, Seraphim Czecker, widely recognized as the driving force behind Ethena's explosive growth, has announced his resignation as head of growth at the synthetic fiat stablecoin protocol. This decision comes as Ethena , a standout success story in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, embarks on a strategic pivot to broaden its offerings and adapt to a rapidly evolving market. Ethena’s meteoric rise in the DeFi space is nothing short of extraordinary. Since its launch earlier this year, the protocol has climbed to the position of the fourth-largest stablecoin by market capitalization, boasting a valuation of over $6 billion. Reflecting on his journey, Seraphim, who often goes by his first name alone, shared his thoughts on X. “[It] has been a truly incredible and rewarding journey. [Being] actively involved in a 0 to 6B success story is something few can comprehend, and it was a life-changing rollercoaster,” he wrote in the post. Seraphim joined Ethena during its $6 million seed round and played a pivotal role in forming over $1 billion in partnerships with leading DeFi platforms. The protocol's flagship USDe stablecoin, which employs an innovative on-chain trading strategy to maintain its peg to the US dollar, is now listed on major centralized exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase, and Deribit. Moreover, its integration across Ethereum and Solana ecosystems has cemented its position as a leader in the DeFi space. Ethena’s rise has been fueled by strong institutional backing. Its seed round included notable investors such as Bybit, Deribit, Gemini, Huobi, OKX, and BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes. This robust support laid the foundation for its rapid ascent, signaling that innovation and growth are still achievable in the ever-challenging cryptocurrency industry. Ethena is now transitioning into a new phase, marked by the recent launch of USDtb, a stablecoin backed by reserves rather than relying solely on cryptonomic mechanisms. The move represents a deliberate attempt to diversify its offerings and appeal to a broader audience seeking more traditional stability in the volatile crypto landscape. “[The] firm is entering a different phase in its growth,” Seraphim noted. Seraphim’s decision to step down reflects personal considerations. In his farewell statement, he expressed exhaustion from years of relentless work in DeFi, having collaborated with virtually every major liquidity provider, protocol, and key opinion leader (KOL) in the industry. “Truth be told, I am also tired of DeFi,” he admitted. “I’ve done literally everything you could do in DeFi.” However, Seraphim remains optimistic about Ethena's future, pledging to support the team from the sidelines and expressing continued “bullish” sentiment for the protocol. Looking ahead, Seraphim is eyeing new opportunities outside of traditional DeFi. While not completely averse to the sector, he revealed his interest in exploring emerging areas such as artificial intelligence (AI), memes, fashion, SocialFi, and entertainment. DeFi’s Resurgence and Lingering Criticisms Ethena’s growth aligns with a broader resurgence in the DeFi sector. Total value locked (TVL) in DeFi protocols has soared to over $120 billion, recovering significantly from a local low of under $40 billion in 2023. Despite this, the sector continues to face scrutiny for its lack of ingenuity and an overemphasis on financial gain. Ethena’s innovative approach to stablecoins and strategic diversification with products like USDtb highlight the protocol’s commitment to breaking free from these critiques. As Ethena navigates its next chapter without one of its key architects, the protocol’s future appears promising. Its ability to adapt, innovate, and diversify will be crucial in maintaining its position as a leader in the competitive DeFi landscape. Seraphim’s departure marks the end of a transformative era for Ethena but also sets the stage for the protocol’s evolution into uncharted territories. Whether Ethena can sustain its momentum and expand its impact remains to be seen, but for now, it stands as a beacon of what’s possible in the dynamic world of cryptocurrency.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6753/ai16z-eyes-layer-1-blockchain-launch-in-tokenomics-overhaul,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png
38341077,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=635342,1735640939,Elon Musk X account name change spurs ‘Kekius Maximus’ insider trading questions,"After a period of political reflection, which involved a significant contribution to Donald Trump’s return to the oval office to “make America great again,” Elon Musk is slowly going back to his sarcastic side. If you’ve been scrolling through X and wondering who Kekius Maximus is, well, it’s probably the last person you expect. Elon Musk, the billionaire entrepreneur also known for his cryptocurrency advocacy, has sparked a new wave of speculation and excitement in the digital currency market. The tech mogul recently made headlines by changing his profile name on X to “Kekius Maximus,” accompanied by a new display picture featuring the infamous “Pepe the Frog” meme. The image, depicting the meme character in golden armor holding a video game controller, quickly gained traction online, stoking both amusement and intrigue. Explosive growth of Memecoin Kekius Maximus ignites insider trading claims The timing of Musk’s profile update has raised some eyebrows in the crypto community. Shortly after his name change, the cryptocurrency named Kekius Maximus (KEKIUS), which shares the name of Musk’s new avatar, saw an extraordinary surge in its market capitalization. In just one hour, Kekius Maximus’s market cap skyrocketed from $54,000 to an astounding $10.4 million, marking an 184-fold increase. According to Coingecko data, the market cap is now more than $130 million. Speculation is rife about the possible connection between Musk’s name change and the dramatic rise of Kekius Maximus. A post on the blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain fueled rumors of insider trading. What a lucky trader—or perhaps an insider! 9 hours ago, he spent $4,360 to buy 18.15M $KM . Just one hour ago, @elonmusk changed his profile name to ""Kekius Maximus,"" sending the price of $KM soaring by ~17,000%. The 18.15M $KM he bought is now worth $638K!… pic.twitter.com/FcYiYaD2wS — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) December 31, 2024 The post claimed that a trader had purchased 18.15 million Kekius Maximus tokens for $4,360 just hours before the price surge, now worth over $638,000. The uncanny timing of Musk’s change of profile name has left many questioning whether the billionaire might have played a hand in igniting a price run. Who is Kekius Maximus? Kekius Maximus is a meme-inspired cryptocurrency operating across multiple blockchain platforms, including Ethereum and Solana. Despite its origins in internet humor, the coin’s developers aim to go beyond the typical meme token hype. The project seeks to combine fun, community engagement, and innovation while providing genuine utility within the blockchain space. Unlike many memecoins that are driven purely by speculative trading, Kekius Maximus claims it intends to create a sustainable ecosystem with real-world applications. The project’s deflationary model and decentralized governance system provide a unique value proposition for holders. KEKIUS, the coin associated with the project, has gained significant attention, growing by over 2,000% since its launch. Kekius Maximus price chart. Source: CoinGecko At press time, the memecoin is priced at $0.1288. It has seen a notable spike in trading volume, up by 180% in just 24 hours. Notably, the project recently reached 100,000 wallet holders, an achievement that signifies growing interest and adoption. KEKIUS also claims to have partnered with a top-tier blockchain gaming studio to launch a play-to-earn (P2E) game in Q1 2025, further expanding its ecosystem and user engagement. In addition to the P2E game, KEKIUS has implemented a token burn, reducing its circulating supply by 5%, which traditionally decreases supply and boosts the price of available tokens. Musk’s influence on the crypto market Elon Musk’s influence on the cryptocurrency market is well-documented, and his recent behavior on X has only intensified his role as a major driver of crypto price movements. While Musk has not publicly commented on the reasons behind his name change, he did share several posts on X that seem to indirectly reference Kekius Maximus. In one post, Musk joked about how a journalist might introduce him as “Elon Musk, aka ‘Kekius Maximus’ on X,” adding, “This will be priceless.” This will be priceless 🤣🤣 https://t.co/YoX4JEDu5l — Kekius Maximus (@elonmusk) December 31, 2024 In another post, Musk made a cryptic reference to the cryptocurrency’s future, predicting that “Kekius Maximus will soon reach level 80 in hardcore PoE” alongside an AI-generated image of the character touching a stone marked with the number 80. While the statement was somewhat playful in tone, it added fuel to the speculation surrounding Musk’s involvement with the coin. This is not the first time Musk has shown his penchant for making bold, sometimes playful, changes to his online persona. In 2023, when he acquired Twitter for $44 billion, he briefly swapped the platform’s iconic blue bird logo for the Dogecoin mascot, resulting in a noticeable spike in Dogecoin’s value. He later rebranded Twitter to X, but the impact of his actions on Dogecoin’s price had already been felt, showcasing Musk’s power to move the crypto market with his online behavior.

The hacker, notorious for exploiting weak private keys, carried out the transfer on December 30, raising fresh questions about the motives and identity of the attacker. Dormant Funds Stir After Two Years Blockchain investigator ZachXBT reported that the stolen funds, previously distributed across ten separate wallet addresses, were consolidated into a multisignature wallet labeled “0xC45…1D542.” The transfers, executed in batches of 5,000 Ether, occurred within a narrow window between 8:54 PM and 9:18 PM UTC. These addresses had remained untouched since January 21, 2023, when the hacker last moved the 51,000 ETH alongside 470 Bitcoin. The hacker has been active since 2016 and is known for leveraging a technique dubbed “Ethercombing.” This involves brute-forcing private keys using faulty random number generators or weak coding practices. By 2019, the hacker had already amassed nearly 45,000 ETH by uncovering 732 private keys associated with over 49,000 transactions, according to a report from Independent Security Evaluators. Notably, Blockchain Bandit transferred the loot for the first time in January last year, as TheCoinRise reported. Hacker’s Identity Remains a Mystery Despite extensive investigations, the identity of the Blockchain Bandit remains unknown. Crypto security analyst Adrian Bednarek once suggested the possibility of a state actor like North Korea being involved, given the sophistication and scale of the thefts. The recent consolidation comes amid a surge in crypto hacking activity in 2024 . A report from Cyvers, an on-chain security firm, revealed that over $2.3 billion worth of assets were stolen across 165 major incidents this year, marking a 40% increase from 2023. The report highlighted access control breaches as the leading cause of these thefts, responsible for $1.9 billion of the losses across 67 incidents. For the crypto community, the question remains whether this renewed activity signals an impending liquidation or merely a reshuffling of illicit gains to evade detection.

Here Are the Factors That Triggered the Decline!,"Bitcoin (BTC) markets continued their downtrend late on Monday, with prices falling below $92,000 on Tuesday morning. Bitcoin Balances Prospects as ETFs Record $420 Million Outflows Ahead of New Year Despite MicroStrategy’s year-end Bitcoin purchase and the market’s anticipation of policy changes from US President-elect Donald Trump, investors and analysts are predicting subdued activity heading into 2025. Investors at Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a Telegram post that they were “skeptical of any New Year’s breakout” as funding rates remained steady. They highlighted the historical average return of +3.3% in January, similar to +4.8% in December, suggesting price action could remain limited through February. “Option flows reflect similar sentiments, with front-end volatility falling and risk-reversal bids mostly for call options in March,” they said, referring to rising call options sentiment in March. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) containing Bitcoin have experienced significant outflows, with $420 million withdrawn on December 30 alone. Fidelity's FBTC led the decline with $154 million in outflows, followed by Grayscale's GBTC ($130 million) and BlackRock's IBIT ($36 million). ETFs have recorded net outflows of more than $1.5 billion since Dec. 19, marking a sharp reversal from the nearly $2 billion inflows seen earlier in the month. Analysts interpret this trend as a potential shift towards a more cautious or bearish outlook on Bitcoin’s short-term performance. Bitcoin is set to close December with a 4% monthly loss, its worst performance since 2021. This decline comes after a 117% year-on-year surge as retail investors and long-term holders took profits. The decline in Bitcoin prices also affected major altcoins, with ether (ETH), XRP, Solana’s SOL, and Cardano’s ADA all dropping by up to 3% before recovering slightly. MicroStrategy Acquisition Fails to Boost Sentiment MicroStrategy, a leading bitcoin development firm, announced its eighth consecutive week of BTC purchases, adding 2,138 BTC for $209 million on Dec. 29. Thus, its total holdings reached 446,400 BTC. However, the announcement failed to boost market sentiment. BTC prices fell further following the news, with MicroStrategy shares falling by 8% to their lowest level since November. *This is not investment advice.

Sharing a photo of the publication, they highlighted the newspaper’s discussion on XRP’s legal challenges and the broader implications of the court ruling. The publication by The Times delves into the implications of Judge Analisa Torres’ ruling in the ongoing legal dispute between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple. The article, titled Judging Crypto’s True Value, sheds light on the lawsuit, its regulatory consequences, and the impact of the recent U.S. election on XRP’s performance. pic.twitter.com/MyqUgwEDs3 — Digital Asset Investor (@digitalassetbuy) December 29, 2024 Ripple vs. SEC: A Legal Overview According to The Times, the legal battle originated from the SEC allegations that Ripple violated securities regulations by offering XRP without prior authorization. The publication outlines the case progression, which has remained a focal point in cryptocurrency regulatory debates. The article highlighted significant developments, including the summary judgment issued by Judge Torres in 2023. While the SEC sought $2 billion in penalties earlier this year, the court instead imposed a $125 million fine on Ripple in August. The publication also noted that the central issue revolves around XRP’s classification—whether it qualifies as a security under U.S. law. Crypto advocates and industry experts referenced in the article criticized the SEC’s aggressive regulatory approach under Gary Gensler’s leadership. Some argued that the lawsuit reflects a broader trend of hostility towards cryptocurrencies. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP Price Surge and Trump’s Influence The publication emphasized the sharp increase in XRP’s value following Donald Trump’s reelection and his appointment of pro-crypto advocate Paul Atkins as the incoming SEC chair. Since Trump’s victory, XRP’s value has seen remarkable growth, soaring from $0.55 to $2.86 within a month—a 420% increase. This price surge has positioned XRP as the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Market analysts attribute the rise to optimism about regulatory reforms expected under Atkins, which may offer a more favorable climate for digital assets like XRP. Ripple Lawsuit’s Current Status In October, the SEC appealed Judge Torres’ decision on programmatic XRP sales and other distributions deemed non-securities. The appeal, filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, seeks to overturn portions of the ruling. The SEC is scheduled to submit its appellate brief by January 15, 2025, shortly before Trump’s inauguration. Despite the appeal, legal experts suggest that the incoming SEC leadership could adopt a less confrontational approach. Attorney Fred Rispoli speculated that Atkins might opt for a settlement with Ripple, potentially reducing the penalties imposed by Judge Torres The article also noted the growing attention from XRP supporters and investors. While optimism surrounds potential changes in the SEC’s stance, the crypto market remains vigilant as the appeal progresses.

38340641,https://finbold.com/?p=224499,1735640313,Analyst sets Dogecoin (DOGE) price roadmap to $1.50 by Q1 2025,"Dogecoin’s ( DOGE ) price action appears to align with a historical pattern, with analysts predicting a potential surge to $1.50 by the end of Q1 2025. Notably, TradingShot , in a recent analysis on TradingView , identified striking similarities between Dogecoin’s current consolidation phase and its accumulation period from January to February 2024. These similarities suggest that DOGE may be setting up for another major rally in the coming months. Historical patterns indicate an accumulation phase Following a sharp 45% decline from its December 8 high, Dogecoin has been trading sideways for over a week, struggling to reclaim its 50-day moving average (1D MA50). However, this phase, as noted by the analyst, is characteristic of typical accumulation periods seen during bull cycles. DOGE price analysis chart. Source: TradingShot/TradingView To build on this observation, TradingShot highlights several key technical factors that reinforce the likelihood of a turnaround. These include a breakdown below the 1D MA50, oversold relative strength index ( RSI ) levels hovering near 34, and strong support at the 200-day moving average (1D MA200). Together, these indicators suggest that Dogecoin could be laying the groundwork for its next major move. This setup, as TradingShot notes, bears a striking resemblance to early 2024, when Dogecoin underwent a similar accumulation phase following a 1D Golden Cross . Back then, a two-month consolidation period led to a parabolic rally, driving DOGE to the 3.0 Fibonacci extension level. Analysts now predict DOGE could mirror its historical trends, with projections indicating the cryptocurrency may climb to $1.50 by March or April 2025. More bullish projections Supporting the bullish outlook, Trader Tardigrade’s analysis highlights that Dogecoin is following a fractal pattern similar to its previous cycles, with the price respecting its long-term trendline. If #Dogecoin follows its previous patterns, it may have reached a local bottom. $Doge next stops: $0.5, $1, $1.5, $3.2 🚀 pic.twitter.com/zK71m8wHiD — Trader Tardigrade (@TATrader_Alan) December 30, 2024 The identification of a local bottom further reinforces this perspective, pointing to key interim targets at $0.50, $1, and $1.50, with the possibility of extending to $3.20 as momentum builds. The convergence of these analyses strengthens the bullish case for Dogecoin, provided it holds critical support levels and successfully breaks through key resistance zones. Taking an even more ambitious stance, analyst Ali Martinez , as reported by Finbold, projects a potential surge of 6,770% for Dogecoin. This would translate to a staggering price of $22.11 if the cryptocurrency continues to follow the ascending channel pattern identified in its historical trends. DOGE price analysis At press time, Dogecoin was trading at $0.31179, marking a 2.56% decline over the past week and a steep 26% drop over the past month. DOGE seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Despite this short-term dip, DOGE has demonstrated remarkable growth since the start of the year, rising from approximately $0.092 to $0.15 by early November, a 63.04% increase. While technical indicators hint at the potential for further gains, Dogecoin’s immediate challenge lies in breaching the critical $1 mark , a key psychological and technical milestone that could pave the way toward its broader projection of $1.50 by Q1 2025.

Musk AI King (MUSKAI), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKAI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk AI King can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk AI King could become the next viral memecoin. Musk AI King launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk AI King on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk AI King by entering its contract address – 8hfjjhqWbfVZsqxCKVQu115AXUzUPTHZFXZwk81rYTMw – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKAI.

MicroStrategy's leveraged Bitcoin strategy may face challenges in 2025 due to its rate sensitivity and the incoming U.S. administration taking time to ease regulations, making MSTY a safer income-focused alternative. MSTY's income strategy, through selling call options, delivers regular dividends and cushions against volatility, outperforming other income-focused investments like ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF. For those prioritizing regular income over capital gains, MSTY is a better option, though near-term volatility is expected as the new government settles in. On a cautionary tone, one of the trade-offs of the income strategy is having to forego the larger capital appreciation obtained by directly owning the stock itself. The Yieldmax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF ( MSTY ) aims to generate income through covered calls made on MicroStrategy’s ( MSTR ) stock which has already gained more than 350% as shown below this year driven by several catalysts. However, market conditions in 2025 may be different in case the Federal Reserve keeps interest rates higher for longer. Data by YCharts Also, one cannot exclude volatility risks because of the high expectations built into Bitcoin's ( BTC-USD ) price after the election of a crypto-friendly President, especially if the incoming U.S. administration takes time to execute its promises about easing regulations and building a national Bitcoin reserve . Amid such a backdrop, this thesis aims to show that MSTY which has delivered significant total returns as per the above orange chart, is better for Bitcoin exposure going into 2025 because of the risks associated with MicroStrategy's leveraged approach to crypto investing. MicroStrategy's Appeal May Falter in 2025 In this connection, I was bullish on the stock back in June based mainly on the Fed cutting down rates, and it has already appreciate by more than 100% since then. Moreover, from an IT play, the company has transformed its business model to be among the top holders of Bitcoin with about 331,200 held according to an SEC filing dated November 18. Subsequently, it purchased additional coins with an estimated total of 444,262 BTC on December 23. Furthermore, its strategy to continually spend cash generated from its software operations, contract debt, and issue equity has enabled it to position itself as a key corporate holder of BTC, second only to BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ). More importantly, it has outperformed Bitcoin by more than four times during the last 3 years as shown in the orange chart below, and, this, despite the approval of several spot ETFs in January this year. Thus, investors have continued to trust the stock confirming its role as a Bitcoin proxy. However, it remains highly rate sensitive. Thus, looking further at the price action, it started surging around November 19 after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 50 basis points as highlighted in green below. This is explained by its Bitcoin holdings being financed mostly by debt, meaning a lowering of the cost of capital improves finances. seekingalpha.com However, it suffered from a sharp downturn around December 19 after the Fed cut rates by 25 basis points , but Powell hinted that there may be fewer reductions in 2025. This increases the risks associated with its leveraged approach to crypto investing, and, as a rate-sensitive stock, it is likely to suffer from volatility if borrowing costs remain higher for longer, thereby increasing debt servicing costs. seekingalpha.com Thinking aloud, in addition to tighter monetary policy reducing the attractiveness of MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy, it may also face volatility risks in case President-elect Trump's nominee for the SEC (Security and Exchange Commission) takes time to ease regulations around crypto. In these circumstances, it makes sense to consider the Yieldmax ETF because of the income rationale. MSTY's Income Means a Better Total Return Looking deeper into the strategy, it is tied to MicroStrategy's stock performance and involves selling call options, which allows the fund managers to collect premiums that are eventually paid as distributions to shareholders. Thus, the fund has paid dividends regularly almost every month since its inception in February this year. Also, the yields of 93.35% paid on a trailing twelve-month basis exceed the mean for all other ETFs by a whopping 3,300% as shown below. seekingalpha.com However, in contrast to other dividend-paying ETFs which hold the shares of publicly listed companies and whose yields increase gradually with time, MSTY which was incepted on February 21 this year, excludes dividend growth as the amount paid varies widely as shown below. seekingalpha.com This is because the income depends on how shares of MicroStrategy have fared. Thus, during favorable market conditions, when the stock evolves either sideways or is on a moderate uptrend as was the case from April to October, fund managers were able to well execute the call options strategy. As a result, while the price performance charts diverge widely, MSTY's total return since its inception has mostly evolved alongside MicroStrategy's from April to October as charted below. For investors, the total return shows performance when the income obtained is reinvested back into the ETF. www,seekingalpha.com However, subsequently, there was a sharp divergence between the returns of MicroStrategy and the ETF as when its underlying asset undergoes a sharp uptrend, part of the upside is capped leading to underperformance relative to MicroStrategy's stock. Yieldmax's Gain is Capped but Provides Protection Against Volatility Thus, in a bull market, the price of the underlying asset (MicroStrategy) can exceed the strike price of the option calls being sold. This compels the fund managers to sell the shares at the strike price itself, thereby limiting further gains. Consequently, obtaining good returns depends on whether the strike price remains below the underlying stock, and this is more likely to occur in relatively stable or slightly bullish market conditions. Only during these conditions, which, I believe, should occur in 2025, can the income generated enhance overall returns enough to match or slightly trail the stock. Next, I look for MSTY's performance where the stock is on a downtrend. In this case, the income generated from selling call options can lower capital losses suffered as a result of owning the stock. This was the case after December 19 as pictured below when the Fed made a hawkish cut as mentioned earlier and MSTY's total return suffered less than MicroStrategy's. This means the income strategy succeeded at providing some cushion against volatility. seekingalpha.com Tellingly, Chair Powell's comments about monetary policy unlikely to be eased further not only impacted Bitcoin's value but also caused the broader market to slump by around 3% . Now, in case the market slumps further, MicroStrategy's ability to sell equities at a premium to take advantage of favorable investor sentiment to grow its Bitcoin pile may be put into question. For this matter, at the time of writing, it was trading at around $330 which is over a hundred dollars lower than its mid-December peak of $436. Thus, looking ahead, the Fed signaling fewer rate cuts may dampen risk appetite for growth stocks that tend to have higher valuation multiples, as exemplified by MicroStrategy's sky-high P/S of 131x. The problem is in a higher-for-longer rate environment, it may not be able to borrow enough money at attractive rates to grow fast enough to justify its valuation. Moreover, higher-for-longer rates may prompt investors to rotate toward more value, dividend, or other income-generating strategies in case the recent uptrend seen in inflation is sustained. MSTY Appears better Positioned than a Direct Investment in MicroStrategy Therefore, in a macroeconomic environment where rates are maintained at their present level or even raised as the Fed monitors the inflationary effects of the tariffs potentially imposed on imports from the rest of the world, and migration control measures, MicroStrategy's share price may not benefit from the same momentum created by the earlier 50 basis point rate cuts. On the contrary, as a leveraged stock, the disproportionately high gains it has enjoyed from Bitcoin's price moves may work against it. Moreover, as an alternative, the Yieldmax ETF has been closely shadowing MicroStrategy and has a 0.96 correlation with the stock, except, during periods of extreme Bitcoin fluctuations. Thus, for those wishing to remain invested in BTC, MSTY is a better option as it can mitigate the effects of volatility potentially engulfing MicroStrategy in case market conditions become unfavorable. www.yieldmaxetfs.com/ However, on a cautious note, one of the trade-offs of benefiting from the income strategy is having to forego part of the capital appreciation obtained by directly owning the stock. Also, MSTY’s 0.99% fee grinds into the capital appreciation, especially during bull or bear markets. Still, the impact of such a trade-off appears negligible in comparison to the rate-sensitivity risks facing MicroStrategy in case it takes on more debt. In this connection, as of November 18, there were only $15.3 billion remaining in authorized shares available for issuance under its sales agreement. Now, in addition to diluting shares, the problem here is the limited quantity left for issuance could restrict its ability to expand its Bitcoin holdings at the same pace as before unless it issues additional debt. MSTY is Better as an alternative income-focused investment than BITO Therefore, for those looking to profit from MicroStrategy in 2025 and ready to accept less capital gains in favor of regular income, investing through MSTY may be the better option. To further support my argument, Yieldmax has performed better than an alternative income-focused investment based on bitcoin futures, or the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BITO ) since its inception as charted below. Data by YCharts The reason is despite its upside being capped during MicroStrategy's sharp upsides, MSTY has been more consistent at generating income from selling call options than BITO which depends on Bitcoin’s price movement for this purpose. Thus, despite also being exposed to leverage (through MicroStrategy), MSTY has better profited from Bitcoin's price action. Finally, as investors look towards income and prioritize risk-adjusted returns in a potentially higher-for-longer rate environment, MSTY's is likely to perform better. While its exact price will depend on both Bitcoin and MicroStrategy's trading range, I have a hold position as its current share price of $29.5 remains below its 10-day and 50-day but above its 100-day moving average, hinting at near-term volatility. As for MicroStrategy, I remain cautious because of its rate sensitivity, despite my prediction for BTC to rise to around $105K in the latter part of 2025.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4747064-msty-is-better-than-microstrategy-if-rates-remain-higher-for-longer?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/38340594.jpeg

He then put up a selling order, claiming it was a mistake, then bought back and burned his earnings. Siqi Chen, CEO of Runway and co-founder of Serious Business, once again caused chaos in the world of meme tokens. A rug pull and a token going to zero would not be noticed if it were not for Chen’s public profile and the recent losses from the MIRA token. MIRA was launched on December 25, granting a share of the tokens to Chen. That share briefly expanded from around $440K to $6M in notional value, boosted by the hype of belonging to a legitimate cancer research charity. Chen launched ZERO with a warning that it is a test token that would go down to zero. Since meme token trading often uses bots, there were in fact buy orders, immediately injecting SOL liquidity and raising the token’s value. Chen at one point sold ZERO, acquiring 444 SOL, then reversed that and demonstrated he held no earnings. so i launched a test token called zero, with the description: “this is going to zero … do not buy it” thinking that people would read it and not buy it. i didn’t expect everyone to just be able to see it and buy it – i thought it’s something i would have needed to tweet about.… pic.twitter.com/bH4b0PIlJH — Siqi Chen (@blader) December 30, 2024 On-chain researcher ZachXBT raised objections , showing that Chen also bought another token, ChAIrity, also placing a sell order that crashed the price. After the second token launch, however, Chen has stated he is ready to make some of the losing parties whole, despite the token warnings. Others warned Chen to avoid paying those that claim ZERO caused losses, as the token had a clear warning. No payments or compensation has been offered for MIRA traders, who managed to take much more significant profits. The ZERO token still holds $141K in liquidity, and has not actually gone to zero. Since bots and irrational buyers are always active, the asset may see ongoing activity and not be abandoned. Until then, ZERO may continue to lead to losses, or put pressure on Chen to recover the damages. MIRA continues to slide as a charity token The older MIRA token continues to slide, showing that mixing charity and meme token trading has a big downside. MIRA pumped again to $0.026, then erased 50% of its value to $0.013. The token has only $814K in liquidity and has survived for several days. Chen has warned he expects the token to go to zero, as he continued selling to take profits for his cancer research charity. At the same time, early buyers blamed him for not warning about potential losses. Whales were also easily taking profit, benefitting from the charity hype. Initially, Chen said he did not mind the profit potential of MIRA, despite causing losses for the community. Some of the early wallets achieved profits of over $480K , essentially taking away funds that some buyers thought would go to charity. While MIRA was more efficient than the GoFundMe approach, it also led to great inefficiencies as traders sold their early positions. MIRA gets boost from Binance Alpha Despite whale selling, and despite warnings that Chen would liquidate his entire share of MIRA, the token may continue to trade. MIRA was added as one of the daily selections of Binance Alpha , allowing for fast purchases. MIRA has already spread to 11,944 holders, and new whales have appeared. The token also sees activity from high-volume clusters. The clusters are unrelated to Chen’s known wallet. MIRA tokens are held in whale wallets, with Siqi Chen controlling $1.1M worth of tokens as of December 31, 2024. | Source: Bubblemaps As of December 31, part of the donation is still in Chen’s wallet, valued at around $1.1M after the recent price slide. MIRA can only be sold in small batches, due to its low liquidity. The token still lacks market-makers, and there is no long-term strategy for continuing its charity purpose. With MIRA and ZERO, Chen may find himself involved with an unintended crypto community, who may continue to pump the token and demand exposure. After the introduction of MIRA , the brief charity token trend subsided. The one asset that remained more active was ChAIrity, with only $50K in liquidity. The token pumped briefly, then lost more than 90% of its value as most of the holders were selling. Even those that wanted to donate to charity were reluctant to give up their funds to whales, instead of an actual charity.

38343281,https://cryptonews.com/?p=323628,1735639805,MicroStrategy Shares Down 46% from November Peak Amid Growing Concerns Over Bitcoin Debt Strategy,"MicroStrategy (MSTR) shares fell below $300 during after-hours trading on Monday, marking a significant 46% decline from their all-time high in November. The drop comes amid growing concerns over the company’s ambitious $42 billion funding strategy, which heavily relies on increased debt and equity to finance its aggressive Bitcoin accumulation. According to Google Finance, MicroStrategy’s stock closed down 8.2% on Monday at $302.96, its lowest since November 8, before sliding another 3% to $293.59 in extended trading. MicroStrategy’s Shares Show Impressive Gains This Year The sharp decline follows a year of impressive gains, with MSTR up 342% year-to-date, largely driven by Bitcoin’s 121% annual rise and the company’s extensive crypto purchases. MicroStrategy’s most recent acquisition added 2,138 BTC to its reserves, bringing its total holdings to 446,400 BTC. Despite this, and the stock’s inclusion in the Nasdaq 100 index on December 23, MSTR has been on a steady decline since reaching a $543 intraday high on November 21. The company’s “21/21” strategy, announced in October, aims to raise $42 billion over three years by issuing $21 billion in equity and $21 billion in fixed-income securities. Earlier this month, MicroStrategy proposed increasing its Class A common shares by 10 billion and preferred shares by one billion, a move that has sparked criticism. The Kobeissi Letter described the proposal as a “lose-lose” scenario, stating that approval would dilute existing shareholders, while rejection would hinder the company’s ability to buy Bitcoin on leverage. Here's a comparison of $MSTR vs #Bitcoin since November 20th. Bitcoin has traded almost completely flat on a net basis, even after rising as much as +16%. Meanwhile, $MSTR is down ~36% and continues to widen the gap between the two assets. Why is this happening? pic.twitter.com/ONWhaSWoqP — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) December 30, 2024 MicroStrategy co-founder Michael Saylor, who holds 46.8% of the voting power, will play a key role in the shareholder vote. Bitcoin’s recent dip to $92,241 has added to investor concerns, fueling the stock’s downturn. Critics argue that the company’s reliance on leveraged Bitcoin purchases exposes it to heightened risk, with some suggesting that investors now see MSTR as too risky. However, Felix Hartmann of Hartmann Capital offered a different perspective . He noted that MicroStrategy’s near-zero-interest debt, with maturities extending to 2030, poses no immediate threat. Hartmann acknowledged that while the company might eventually implode, it could first rise to become one of the top five companies by market capitalization. My take on Saylor/MSTR: It will eventually implode, but most shorts will time it wrong and blow up betting against BTC and MSTR. Key points: • Much of MSTR’s debt is near 0% interest, with maturities spread between 2027–2030, so neither servicing nor re-payment are near-term… — Felix Hartmann (@FelixOHartmann) December 30, 2024 MicroStrategy to Join Nasdaq 100 Index It is worth noting that MicroStrategy joined the Nasdaq 100 index on December 23, 2024. The inclusion places the company among the top 100 largest firms on the Nasdaq by market capitalization, offering indirect Bitcoin exposure to stock investors, including those holding the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ), an ETF managing assets worth $322 billion. As reported, Saylor has also expressed strong support for President-elect Donald Trump’s proposal to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Detailed in his “Digital Assets Framework” policy, the proposal outlines a roadmap for the United States to foster growth in the digital asset industry, establish clear compliance standards, and ensure defined rights for crypto asset holders and companies.

In South Korea, the arrest warrant for impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol rattled the crypto market. Meanwhile, Malaysia intensified its crackdown on unregistered crypto exchanges by ordering Bybit to cease operations in the country. Treasury Breach Sparks Tensions Between US and China A recent cybersecurity breach at the United States Treasury was attributed to a Chinese state-sponsored Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actor, though the Chinese government denied responsibility for the incident. The breach was reported to lawmakers on Dec. 30, and was first detected by BeyondTrust, a third-party software provider, on Dec. 8. According to Assistant Secretary for Management Aditi Hardikar, the incident allowed unauthorized remote access to certain unclassified documents on employee workstations. However, she assured that there is no evidence suggesting continued access to Treasury systems or information. China very firmly denied the accusations, and stated that it opposes what it called baseless claims by the US government. The US Treasury has since taken the compromised service offline and is collaborating with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI), intelligence agencies, and forensic investigators to probe the matter further. BeyondTrust revealed that it identified the security issue in its Remote Support product on Dec. 2 and confirmed anomalous activity on Dec. 5, immediately revoking the compromised API key and notifying impacted clients. The company is cooperating with a number of law enforcement and investigative agencies to understand the full extent of the attack. This breach happened after another major cybersecurity incident earlier this year that was dubbed the Salt Typhoon breach. During this attack, attackers reportedly accessed phone calls and text messages of lawmakers. For now, the Treasury committed to providing a detailed supplemental report within 30 days as required under the Federal Information Security Modernization Act. A classified briefing on the incident is also planned for staffers of the House Financial Services Committee. Total annual fund loss (Source: Cyvers ) The crypto industry also faced a surge in cyberattacks as over $2.3 billion worth of digital assets were stolen in 2024 across 165 incidents. This was a 40% increase from 2023. The rise in access control breaches, especially targeting centralized exchanges and custodial platforms, has been a major factor in this sharp uptick, according to blockchain security firm Cyvers . Vietnam Police Foil Major Crypto Scam Meanwhile, Vietnamese authorities successfully prevented 300 potential victims from falling prey to an elaborate crypto scam that was orchestrated by a company known as Million Smiles . The scam already defrauded approximately 30 billion Vietnamese dong, or $1.17 million, from around 100 businesses and 400 people. Million Smiles promoted an in-house cryptocurrency called QFS, or Quantum Financial System, through deceptive advertising that falsely linked it to ancestral treasures and spiritual claims. The company also promised unrealistic returns and claimed that owning QFS would grant access to a financial ecosystem with benefits like funding without collateral or interest. Raided Million Smiles HQ (Source: VTV ) Hanoi City Police intercepted a planned meeting by Million Smiles to recruit 300 additional investors, where participants were expected to invest amounts ranging from 4–5 million dong ($190) to as much as 39 million dong ($1,350) for businesses. Law enforcement raided the company’s headquarters, seizing documents, computers, and other materials. Investigations revealed that the QFS token was completely fictitious and not recognized under Vietnamese law. This operation is part of Vietnam’s bigger goal to combat crypto fraud. In October, police in Nghe An province dismantled a Laos-based scam network that was led by offshore actors specializing in fraudulent wire transfers and crypto investment schemes. One victim from Ho Chi Minh City was deceived into investing in a fake app called “Biconomynft,” which resulted in losses of more than 17.6 billion dong ($700,000). South Korea Issues Arrest Warrant for Impeached President South Korea’s political and financial landscape has been shaken after the issuance of an arrest warrant for President Yoon Suk Yeol. The Seoul Western District Court approved the warrant on Dec. 31 after Yoon, who was impeached and suspended from office earlier in December, failed to appear for questioning for the third time. The request was made by a joint investigation taskforce comprising the Korean National Police Agency, the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials (CIO), and the Criminal Investigation Command of the Defense Ministry. The warrant was issued after Yoon tried to impose martial law during a live television address on Dec. 3 due to threats from North Korea and a need to eliminate anti-state elements. His actions were widely condemned, which led to his impeachment and suspension by South Korea’s parliament on Dec. 14. Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok is currently serving as interim leader. Yoon’s martial law declaration caused immediate turmoil in the crypto market. On South Korean exchanges like UpBit, Bitcoin prices plummeted by as much as $30,000 in just six hours thanks to a liquidity crisis that was exacerbated by the abrupt disappearance of key market players. Internationally, major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP, saw large price dips in response to the news. The crypto market was able to quickly recover after the parliament forced Yoon to lift martial law on Dec. 4. The martial law order came during a period of increased retail crypto trading activity in South Korea. On Dec. 2, the country recorded its second-highest retail trading volume of the year, driven by interest in high-momentum altcoins like XRP, Dogecoin, and Stellar. Malaysia Orders Bybit to Shut Down Operations Malaysia also recently took some serious legal steps by ordering cryptocurrency exchange Bybit to cease operations in the country. The Malaysian SC accused the exchange of operating an unregistered digital asset exchange (DAX). The regulator directed Bybit to disable its website, mobile applications, and other digital platforms within 14 business days starting Dec. 11. Additionally, the regulator mandated the termination of Bybit’s Malaysian Telegram support group and the cessation of advertisements targeting local investors. The SC confirmed that the directives were followed as of Dec. 27. The enforcement action is part of Malaysia’s tightening regulatory environment for cryptocurrency operations. The SC pointed out that operating a DAX without registration as a Recognised Market Operator (RMO) under Section 7(1) of the Capital Markets and Services Act 2007 is a criminal offense. The SC also urged Malaysian investors to use only licensed DAX platforms, which undergo rigorous vetting to protect users and mitigate risks like money laundering and fraud. Bybit’s exit from Malaysia happened after its announcement that it will stop operations in France due to increased regulatory scrutiny by French authorities. Starting Jan. 8, 2025, the exchange will no longer offer withdrawal or custody services for French users.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6751/us-treasury-investigates-cyberattack-with-suspected-chinese-links,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

Bitcoin was rejected at $95,000 and holds above $91,000. The accumulation of altcoins has dropped as traders take profit. Bitcoin market cooling is becoming evident as data from CryptoQuant highlights key shifts in market behavior. Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin struggled to break $95,000 while finding critical support at $91,000. CryptoQuant’s 30-day Taker Buy Sell Ratio, a key market indicator, has turned negative on Binance, suggesting increased sell-side pressure after weeks of strong buying momentum. Analysts believe the current market pullback reflects a period of consolidation following Bitcoin’s peak at $108,000. Currently, takers are filling more sell orders than buy orders. This is a short-term bearish signal. However, it doesn’t necessarily indicate the end of the bull market. Investors need to observe if this trend continues. If sell contracts remain dominant, a deeper correction could occur. But if buying pressure returns, the bull market may resume its upward trajectory, especially with the pro-crypto Trump administration taking office in January 2025.

Established chains like Bitcoin seek after its ability to create smart contracts. The Layer-1 protocol that ADA uses continues to grow. The recent market events have made investors cautious about Cardano, but it remains a technically sound blockchain to use. However, the new altcoin on the crypto scene is DTX Exchange (DTX), which offers a hybrid trading platform. DTX is gaining attention by combining centralized (CEX) and decentralized finance (DeFi) features. These flexible and innovative features make DTX one of the best altcoins as we advance into 2025. DTX Exchange (DTX) is one of the promising new ICOs with plenty of room for growth. In addition to its growth prospects, its future transformation of the crypto trading scene makes it a solid altcoin to hold. It combines CEX and DEX to bridge the gap between TradFi and DeFi, giving traders a unified platform on which to trade. Cardano Drops 20% As Markets Correct Cardano investors have been on edge recently as ADA is facing intense challenges. Despite a surge that saw ADA briefly climbing up to $1.31, the token has since dropped to $0.87. This signals a period of consolidation for Cardano, with analysts identifying key resistance points at $0.91 and $0.86. However, some experts suggest that this consolidation phase should allow the ADA market to build support for a future rally. Investors continue to use Cardano as a route to access a strong investor base invested in ADA’s long-run potential. After its new bridge technology enhanced Bitcoin security and adoption, the Cardano price has actively trailed the BTC price. ADA price has dropped 25% in a month with 52% higher trading volume, breaking records for the past two years. DTX Exchange Raises $11 Million As Investors Gain 17% DTX Exchange (DTX) is an emerging investment option this year that can make early buyers earn millions once the project is launched on the mainnet. This modern trading platform with industry-relevant features and high-end technologies has made DTX Exchange a go-to platform for seamless trading and mega profits. The platform has massive growth potential as traders see it as a comprehensive trading hub with end-to-end solutions. With a native non-custodial wallet to the first-ever hybrid layer-1 blockchain for seamless trading, DTX Exchange is known as one of the biggest presales of 2024, raising a ground-breaking $11 million in stage 7. DTX presale is available at $0.14 before its anticipated mainnet launch. Smart traders are capitalizing on its massive early-stage potential as they look forward to bullish gains in Q1 2025. Experts say that buying a DTX presale at this entry position when its price goes much higher is the best financial decision, as the platform can crack into the top 20 rankings after its listing. Conclusion Although Cardano’s focus on DeFi and interoperability is excellent, DTX Exchange takes a new approach and uses hybrid blockchain technology, giving it the potential to become a next-generation platform. Though ADA is still a contender for top altcoin with its BTC bridge and well-established ecosystem, DTX represents an unmissable opportunity to diversify and benefit from the cryptocurrency market’s evolution. While the BTC price continues to hover around the $92K range, Cardano (ADA) and DTX Exchange (DTX) show potential for an upside rally as the demand grows in preparation for a bull run. Entering these projects early on is the best move in the current market cycle as you might regret missing them later or lose money buying in at higher prices once they go 100x from their current price points.

38340038,https://coinpaprika.com/news/microstrategy-buys-209m-in-bitcoin-before-year-end,1735639052,MicroStrategy Buys $209M in Bitcoin Before Year-End,"MicroStrategy has continued its aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy , purchasing 2,138 BTC for $209 million on December 30. Despite ongoing market uncertainty, the company remains firm in its long-term Bitcoin vision, with Michael Saylor hinting at more purchases in 2025 rather than a pause. According to an SEC filing, MicroStrategy acquired Bitcoin at an average price of $97,837 per BTC. This marks the firm’s fifth purchase in December and the eighth consecutive week of acquisitions. The move aligns with Saylor's earlier advice encouraging investors to use a dollar-cost averaging (DCA) approach when buying Bitcoin. Saylor confirmed via social media that MicroStrategy now holds 446,400 BTC, acquired for approximately $27.9 billion at an average price of $62,428 per Bitcoin. The company has achieved a quarterly BTC yield of 47.8% and a yearly yield of 74.1%. Earlier this month, MicroStrategy invested $561 million in Bitcoin following Saylor’s public support for the concept of a US Bitcoin Reserve. Additionally, he called a shareholder meeting to discuss issuing more company shares, with the proceeds directed towards further Bitcoin purchases. Despite its bold acquisition strategy, MicroStrategy remains heavily leveraged. The firm has used debt financing, equity sales, and 0% convertible bonds to fund its aggressive Bitcoin buying spree. While this approach has led MicroStrategy’s stock to outperform Bitcoin’s growth over the past year, it also leaves the company highly exposed to market volatility. The recent market correction has sparked rumors of a potential pause in MicroStrategy’s buying activity in January. However, Saylor's public statements suggest the opposite. He has consistently indicated plans for continued acquisitions rather than slowing down. Bitcoin has faced strong price resistance, with analysts predicting possible market turbulence ahead. However, Saylor seems undeterred, showing no clear signs of halting purchases despite speculation. He remains confident in Bitcoin’s long-term value and continues to view it as a cornerstone of MicroStrategy’s financial strategy. The company’s ongoing investments demonstrate its unwavering commitment to Bitcoin as a primary store of value. As 2025 approaches, all eyes remain on Saylor and MicroStrategy to see whether their relentless buying strategy will persist in the face of market uncertainties.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/microstrategy-buys-209m-in-bitcoin-before-year-end,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/38340038.jpeg

Bitcoin's price faces bearish pressure, with a breakdown below $93,000, marking a 1.12% drop in the past 24 hours. The CMC Fear and Greed Index has declined to 48, reflecting growing uncertainty among investors.As BTC struggles to surpass key resistance levels, technical indicators suggest potential downside risks, while analysts remain divided on the possibility of a bullish rebound.Bitcoin Price AnalysisRespecting the long-coming resistance trend line in the 4-hour chart, the BTC price continues a bearish trend. As expected in our last article , the crucial support level at $92,750 failed to absorb the incoming supply. The breakdown rally almost reached the $90,000 level as predicted, making a low of $91,315. With the lower price rejections, the BTC price experienced an early reversal from the estimated target of $90,742.However, the bullish recovery to $92,748 failed to surpass the 20-EMA line and the resistance trendline. This led to a quick pullback below the $93,000 mark. Currently, Bitcoin is trading at $92,748, with a minor recovery of 0.43% in the past 4 hours. The 4-hour RSI line shows a quick turnaround from the oversold region, suggesting a possibility of sideways continuation.The consolidation range is expected to respect the $90,742 support zone while struggling to break through the resistance trendline.Fidelity Leads the Outflow Pack on December 30As the market experiences a pullback, institutional support for Bitcoin declines. On December 30, the daily total net inflow of the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF registered an outflow of $426.13 million. Bitcoin ETFs Leading the bearish pack, Fidelity saw an outflow of $154.64 million, followed by Grayscale with an exit of $134.5 million.BTC Price TargetsWith the new year on the horizon, growing bullish anticipation may push Bitcoin above the resistance trendline.In this case, the BTC price could reach the immediate resistance level of $95,119. This is extremely close to the dynamic average line of the 50-EMA.On a side note, the 50-EMA has generated a death cross with the 200-EMA, signaling a potential sell-off. Furthermore, the declining 100-EMA is approaching the 200-EMA for another bearish crossover event.On the bearish front, a breakdown below $90,742 would open the door to the next support level at $86,707.Analyst Lights Hope for 2025Despite multiple sell signals, independent analyst Ali Martinez has highlighted a massive potential for growth in Bitcoin. Finding a correlation between the monthly RSI in previous market peaks and the Bitcoin Liquid Index, Martinez expects the BTC price trend to continue its bullish trajectory.In previous bull market peaks, the monthly RSI reached 92 before the start of the next bear market. Currently, the monthly RSI line sits at 75, suggesting that the ongoing bull run has more fuel left than the bears anticipate. Ali comment on Bitcoin RSI Ali's comment on Bitcoin RSI ConclusionThe Bitcoin (BTC) price trend struggles under bearish pressure as technical indicators like the death cross and declining EMAs signal a continued downtrend.However, with RSI recovering from oversold levels and analysts suggesting more room for growth, a bullish breakout remains possible, targeting the $95,119 resistance level.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/31/bitcoin-analysis-bearish-trendline-in-focus-as-bulls-eye-95119/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=bitcoin-analysis-bearish-trendline-in-focus-as-bulls-eye-95119,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

With over $425 million in options trading on its first day , IBIT has set an unmatched benchmark for market demand. Boasting an expense ratio of 0.25%, it is projected to generate $112 million annually , further cementing its financial strength. Since its launch in early 2024, following SEC approval, IBIT has rapidly climbed to become one of the most successful ETFs globally. Industry experts have hailed it as the fastest-growing ETF across all asset classes, outpacing competitors that have been active for decades. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas highlighted IBIT’s incredible rise, emphasizing its speed in surpassing key milestones compared to other global ETFs. By December, IBIT had already outperformed many well-established European ETFs, some in operation for over 20 years. Nate Geraci described IBIT’s rise as unprecedented, calling it the greatest ETF launch in history. Analyst James Seyffart supported this sentiment, pointing out the ETF's financial strength and its potential to generate over $112 million annually based on its current expense ratio and asset level. Another major achievement for IBIT came after the OCC approved Bitcoin ETF options trading in late 2024. On the first day alone, IBIT options trading volume soared past $425 million, reflecting immense interest and liquidity in the market. BlackRock’s dominance in this space isn't limited to the ETF’s success alone. The firm has also been aggressively accumulating Bitcoin, surpassing other ETF issuers to become one of the largest Bitcoin holders globally. This strategy not only enhances IBIT’s credibility but also reinforces BlackRock’s influence in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Despite occasional market corrections in Bitcoin’s price, BlackRock remains confident about the asset’s long-term potential. Some executives predict Bitcoin’s market will eventually grow into the trillions, positioning IBIT as a key vehicle for mainstream adoption. Over the past decade, BlackRock has maintained a bullish stance on Bitcoin, and this investment strategy has clearly paid off.

The rally was fueled by heightened trading activity, with its daily volume doubling over the past day to $330 million. Zooming out to its weekly and monthly charts, the gains were significantly higher at 156% and 383%, respectively, making it one of the best-performing assets among the top 100 cryptocurrencies during these periods. Why did AI16Z soar today? Several catalysts drove ai16z’s recent rally, with the standout being its plans to launch an open-source Layer-1 blockchain tailored for AI applications, marking a major step in its tokenomics revamp. Additionally, the project will introduce a token launchpad in Q1 2025 Q1 2025, which would become the primary platform for deploying AI projects built on the Eliza framework—the project’s AI operating system. The launchpad is expected to include features such as launch fees, staking requirements for access, and liquidity pool pairings to drive value to the ai16z token. The token will play a dual role, functioning both as a governance token within the DAO and as a utility token for platform activities.

According to data from CoinGlass, the open interest in ai16z’s futures market has risen by a massive 256% to over $22.5 million at press time.

Could MicroStrategy be slowly losing its heat? The MicroStrategy stock (MSTR) is down by 46% from its all-time high in November. This comes as the company’s bid to increase its stock shares by billions of dollars in order to back its funding strategy of $42 billion . According to Google Finance statistics, the firm’s shares fell for the second consecutive day, and the price level reached a whopping low of $ 302.96, meaning a loss of 8.2 % in the stock value. Late-hour trading resulted in a further decrease of the stock price by three percent to $293.59. MicroStrategy’s debt structure reveals $7.26 billion in total debt with an average interest rate of 0.476%. Key maturities include $3 billion due in 2029 at 0% interest, highlighting the company’s long-term financing strategy. Data sourced from SaylorCharts.com by crypto.news . Last week, MSTR acquired 2138 BTC, which increased the total amount to 446400 BTC . Additionally, its shares were added to the index of Nasdaq 100 on Dec. 23, after which its shares surged by 402% . You might also like: Public fitness equipment maker Interactive Strength shares rise 11% on Bitcoin treasury strategy However, ever since the intraday high was reached on Nov. 21 at $543, MSTR has been on the downslide. This fact, however, does not take away the focus from the fact that the firm reported 342% growth for the year so far due to the aggressive accumulation strategy of Bitcoin ( BTC ) that MSTR has been undertaking alongside the gained high price surge of 121% of the cryptocurrency. Is MicroStrategy losing its momentum? MSTR’s BTC amassing approach has been challenged by Martin Shkreli , who co-founded the hedge funds Elea Capital. He called Michael Saylor an “overzealous” and “not credible” supporter of BTC. “The worst vote I’ve ever seen in the history of proxy voting,” he said, referring to MSTR’s shareholder vote on Bitcoin treasury allocation that garnered just 0.5% support on Dec. 24. Shkreli said that market sentiment has changed and that it is now “a little bit hard to see the bull case” for the price of BTC, implying that Saylor’s aggressive multibillion-dollar purchases had underperformed. Markets appear to be concerned over the potential approval of raising authorized share count by 10 billion. Total share could would rise from 330 million to 10.33 BILLION if it is approved. The problem is, it has left the company in a ""lose-lose"" situation for now. pic.twitter.com/CcNr8Etebj — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) December 30, 2024 This is not the first time the company has faced criticism.

The Bitcoin bloodbath is imminent. When prices start crashing like a rock, don’t say we didn’t warn you.

Despite Ethereum’s achievements, including ETF approval and significant software upgrades, it underperformed against its faster, more agile competitors. The report highlights the growing momentum of tokenization, DePin (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks), and scaling solutions , marking them as critical sectors for growth. These areas have consistently shown strong performance and remain among Grayscale’s top investment focuses. Grayscale, a leading Bitcoin ETF issuer and a subsidiary of the Digital Currency Group (DCG), outlined its ""Top 20"" crypto investment opportunities in the report. Smart contracts, in particular, are described as the most competitive segment in the digital asset market. While Ethereum remains a key player, platforms like Solana and Sui have been capturing significant market share. The report explains that the value of smart contract platforms largely depends on their ability to generate network fee revenue. Networks capable of generating high fees can pass value back to users through mechanisms like token burns or staking rewards. Grayscale’s ""Top 20"" smart contract platforms for this quarter include ETH, SOL, SUI, and OP. Interestingly, Ethereum’s challenges aren’t technical but rather competitive. Despite being the first mover, its market dominance is being eroded by newer platforms offering faster transactions and lower fees. Solana, in particular, has emerged as a strong contender, showcasing rapid growth and adoption. Tokenization remains another focal point in Grayscale’s analysis. The process of converting real-world assets into blockchain-based tokens continues to gain traction, promising increased transparency, efficiency, and accessibility in traditional finance sectors. DePin , which focuses on decentralized infrastructure networks, is also gaining attention. These systems use blockchain technology to manage and incentivize physical networks, such as internet connectivity and data storage, offering decentralized solutions for critical infrastructure. Scaling solutions, aimed at improving blockchain transaction efficiency, remain another priority in Grayscale's outlook. These technologies are essential for maintaining network performance as adoption and usage increase. While Grayscale played a pivotal role in securing approval for the Bitcoin ETF in early 2024, it quickly lost its dominant position in that market. Nevertheless, the firm has remained influential, particularly in advancing Ethereum ETF approvals and other innovative financial products. Interestingly, Grayscale's latest report makes only brief mentions of ETFs, focusing instead on broader market fundamentals and emerging trends. This suggests that the firm views ETFs as supplementary rather than central to the future growth of the crypto industry. Overall, Grayscale’s analysis paints an optimistic picture of the crypto market’s future, emphasizing the dynamic energy within smart contracts, tokenization, and decentralized infrastructure. The competition within these sectors is expected to drive significant innovation and growth as the market enters Q1 2025.",POSITIVE,ETH | SOL,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | SOL,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/grayscale-predicts-smart-contracts-to-lead-crypto-market-in-2025,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/38339746.jpeg

Chen claimed he was surprised when people still invested in ZERO despite the warning. “I didn’t expect everyone to just be able to see it [the description] and buy it – I thought it’s something I would have needed to tweet about.

After Chen posted about his daughter’s diagnosis, the crypto community rallied together to raise funds for research to find a cure for the brain tumor. A trader with the username @shawmakesmagic and the ai16z community created a token called MIRA, named after Chen’s daughter, to raise funds for the research. The developer sent Chen 50% of the MIRA token supply, to which he hesitated on selling them because he did not want to rug-pull anyone. Eventually, Chen decided to sell 10% and use 5% of the tokens to fund the Hankinson Lab research, which was worth $49,263 at the time. “I just want to say that whoever said crypto has no legitimate use cases, you can tell them that funding for rare disease research is a pretty legitimate use case,” said Chen.

This decline is expected to continue until the next support level of $2,800. The first quarter of 2025 could serve as the catalyst for a substantial Ethereum rally. In support of this, crypto analyst Rover anticipates that the Ethereum rally will commence on January 1, 2025. This coincides with the peak of Bitcoin’s dominance, as indicated by historical trends. However, a popular analyst, Charting Guy, anticipates that the ETH price will surge to $7,080 by April 2025 in response to this recent action from Justin Sun. Also, according to Binance, the $4,000 mark will not be achieved immediately after Trump’s inauguration. Ethereum ETFs experienced net outflows Yesterday, Ethereum spot ETFs experienced a net outflow of $55.41 million. This represents the initial net outflow following four consecutive days of net inflows. In particular, the Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETF experienced a single-day net outflow of $17.36 million, with a historical cumulative net outflow of $3.634 billion. On the other hand, Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ETF experienced a single-day net outflow of $13.75 million. This is despite its historical cumulative net inflow remaining at $591 million. Currently, the total net asset value of Ethereum spot ETFs is $12.275 billion. This represents 3% of Ethereum’s total market cap. The historical cumulative net inflow is $2.621 billion. Notably, according to reports, alternative ETFs achieved a milestone in November by surpassing $400 billion in net assets. Additionally, the alternative ETFs recorded the highest year-over-year asset growth rate of all asset classes, at 93%. Also, digital assets, trading-leveraged equity, and derivative income ETFs account for the majority of the total alternative ETF market share, which is approximately $325 billion, or 80% Still, financial advisors reported a mere 3.6% allocation to alternatives in 2024. However, this figure is anticipated to rise. The firm discovered that 14.4% of extant alternative allocations are implemented through the utilization of ETFs .

The funds, untouched since 2018, have sparked concern among experts who speculate the move could signal intentions to liquidate, launder, or fund new cyber exploits . Blockchain investigator ZachXBT revealed that all the addresses involved in the transfer were last active in 2018. For newer crypto enthusiasts, the name “Blockchain Bandit” might not ring a bell, but in 2018, it was one of the most feared names in the crypto world. This hacker systematically exploited Ethereum wallets secured by weak private keys, stealing millions by simply guessing them. The attacker targeted wallets with poorly generated or non-random private keys, often caused by programming flaws or faulty cryptographic libraries. By running automated scripts, the hacker scanned the Ethereum network, identified vulnerable wallets, and swiftly transferred funds. Victims often didn’t realize they had been hacked until days later. In total, the Blockchain Bandit is believed to have stolen over 50,000 ETH from 10,000 wallets . The nickname was first coined in a 2019 WIRED article that detailed the attacker’s methods. Security analyst Adrian Bednarek was one of the first to uncover the pattern, explaining that some wallets used embarrassingly weak private keys, such as simple phrases or even the number ‘1.’ The Bandit also exploited weak passphrase-based wallets, known as brain wallets, and misconfigured Ethereum nodes. These vulnerabilities allowed the attacker to remain nearly unstoppable in their operations. The recent activity raises significant questions. Moving funds into a multi-signature wallet suggests preparation for major transactions. These could involve laundering funds through cryptocurrency mixers, decentralized exchanges, or other anonymization tools. Alternatively, the hacker might be planning to liquidate the assets, though selling such a large volume of ETH could impact its market price. Another possibility is that the hacker is waiting for market conditions to improve. A surge in Ethereum’s price would allow for maximum profits upon liquidation. However, the most troubling scenario is that the funds could be used to finance future attacks, cover transaction fees, or support new exploits across blockchain networks. This isn’t the first time the Blockchain Bandit has shown signs of activity in recent years. Some funds were moved back in January 2023 and converted into Bitcoin. However, the recent transfer marks the largest consolidation of stolen funds to date. The crypto industry is already grappling with massive losses from cyberattacks. In 2023 alone, losses reached $2.3 billion, marking a 40% increase from the previous year , with Ethereum being the hardest-hit network. The return of such a notorious hacker is a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities still present in the blockchain ecosystem. Whether the funds are destined for liquidation, laundering, or further attacks, the reappearance of the Blockchain Bandit has put the crypto community on high alert.",NEGATIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/blockchain-bandit-returns-moves-172-million-in-ethereum-after-5-years,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/38339587.jpeg

On-chain analyst Ali Martinez has drawn significant attention with his projection that XRP could rally to $11, citing key technical signals that suggest a major price move next year. “The Bollinger Bands are squeezing on the $XRP daily chart, indicating a big price movement is underway!” Martinez noted in a December 31 update.

While ambitious, the prediction aligns with broader market trends and XRP’s historical behavior during periods of high volatility. As we approach 2025, $XRP is showing one of the most promising setups, with a projected target of $11 pic.twitter.com/y5oYioHnTC — Ali (@ali_charts) December 30, 2024 Current XRP market landscape Despite the bullish outlook, XRP’s recent performance has raised eyebrows among skeptics. The token is currently trading at $1.98, down 8% over the past week, with its market capitalization slipping by $10 billion to $118 billion. These declines highlight the volatility XRP continues to face, even as it maintains its position as one of the leading cryptocurrencies. Technically, XRP is clinging to its $1.86 support level while eyeing resistance at $2.26. The $2 psychological level remains a key battleground, and a decisive break above this point could pave the way for renewed upward momentum, with XRP currently changing hands at $2.07. XRP 1-week price chart. Source: Finbold However, a drop below $1.86 could trigger additional downside, with some analysts pointing to $1.60 as the next potential floor. Notably, XRP is still trading above its 200-day simple moving average, a critical indicator of long-term bullish sentiment. The token has recorded 15 green days in the past 30, reflecting a 50% positive performance rate. While these metrics underscore XRP’s resilience, the near-term outlook remains uncertain, with traders awaiting confirmation of the next major move. XRP historical parallels Javon Marks, another crypto analyst, has drawn parallels between XRP’s current price structure and its historic 2017 bull run. “XRP’s current 3-day timeframe is looking extremely similar to that 2017 run. Prices right now may only be getting ready to come out of an ‘Intermission Phase’ before yet another ‘groundbreaking’ bullish rally!” he remarked. If this analogy holds true, XRP could be on the cusp of a major breakout. The $11 target: Realistic or ambitious? Reaching $11 would represent a nearly 6x increase from current levels, requiring a significant influx of capital and market participation and a 431% price increase. XRP’s inflationary supply dynamics and recent bearish pressures suggest that achieving $11 will not be without challenges. The $1.90-$2 zone has acted as a robust support level, and maintaining this range will be critical for any sustained upward momentum.

In a recent analysis, Van Straten highlighted Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen’s letter to congressional leaders warning that the U.S. could reach its debt limit between January 14 and 23, 2025. Yellen called on Congress to take immediate action to “preserve the full faith and credit of the United States,” noting that “extraordinary measures” may be needed to prevent a federal default. The looming debt ceiling has already caused market unease. Following the announcement, U.S. stocks closed lower, with the S&P 500, Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones Industrial Average losing around 1%. Bitcoin also fell, falling as much as 4% from its intraday high. Historically, debt ceiling increases have coincided with bearish signals for Bitcoin. Over the last five cycles, BTC has either declined or underperformed in the days following debt ceiling adjustments. Related News: It Was Hacked This Year: Developers of Binance-Listed Altcoin Release Statement on the Latest Situation Van Straten drew parallels between Bitcoin’s current price action and its performance during previous market cycles. Since the November 2022 low triggered by the FTX crash, Bitcoin has returned nearly 500%, closely mirroring its trajectory during the 2015-2018 and 2018-2022 cycles. However, both previous cycles have seen significant declines at this stage, which, combined with the broader economic uncertainty surrounding the debt ceiling, points to potential challenges ahead for Bitcoin, according to the analyst. Adding to the uncertainty is the political transition period, which will see Donald Trump take office as President on January 20, 2025. Van Straten suggested that this date could mark a pivotal moment for Bitcoin. “It is possible that Trump’s inauguration could signal a bottom for Bitcoin,” he said, citing historical cycles and current market conditions. *This is not investment advice.

38340646,https://invezz.com/?p=2412241,1735637944,Bitcoin’s bull market: how to read the signals in 2025,"Bitcoin, rebounding powerfully from its bear market lows, has reasserted itself as a leading asset, significantly outperforming traditional financial markets in 2024. Fueled by the historic launch of Bitcoin ETFs in January, a new US administration seemingly supportive of the crypto industry, and the Federal Reserve’s shift toward easing monetary policy, Bitcoin’s resurgence has been remarkable. Bitcoin ETFs: a catalyst for growth The Bitcoin ETFs, launched earlier this year, have been a major catalyst, attracting substantial capital inflows and becoming the most successful ETF launches in history, surpassing $100 billion in assets under management within their first year. This influx of funds has propelled Bitcoin to a year-to-date return of +126%, dwarfing the S&P 500 (+26%), NASDAQ (+33%), and even gold (+28%). While Bitcoin’s price volatility often captures headlines, the underlying mechanisms that determine its value—supply and demand—are transparent thanks to its public blockchain, and offer valuable insights for investors. Five key indicators for 2025 As we move into 2025, investors can leverage key indicators to effectively navigate the bull market. Here are five that are particularly relevant: Exchange balances and net flows: gauging market sentiment Centralized exchanges serve as the hub for Bitcoin trading activity, making exchange balances a crucial indicator of market sentiment. Active traders store their Bitcoin on these platforms to quickly capitalize on price changes, and a current 2.5 million Bitcoin, or 12.6% of the circulating supply, are held on centralized exchanges. This marks a 17% reduction since the start of the year, when 3 million coins were stored on these platforms. The decline suggests that holders may be moving their Bitcoin to private wallets for long-term storage, signaling increased confidence in Bitcoin’s value and reduced selling interest. As market peaks approach, expect the trend to reverse. Rising exchange balances are an indicator of increased selling pressure, while declining balances tend to indicate bullish sentiment. MVRV Z-score: identifying market extremes The MVRV Z-Score is a powerful on-chain valuation tool that helps investors identify potential market extremes, whether overvalued or undervalued. This indicator compares Bitcoin’s market value with its realized value to smooth out short-term price fluctuations and focus on long-term trends. The Z-Score highlights significant deviations, rising into the pink zone when Bitcoin is likely overvalued and dropping into the green zone when it is undervalued. This makes it a crucial indicator for timing investments in Bitcoin’s volatile cycles. Currently, the MVRV Z-Score is below 3, which suggests Bitcoin is not yet overheated. Historically, a Z-Score above 6 is a warning sign, and above 7 has often coincided with a market cycle top. 1+ year HODL wave: tracking long-term holders The 1+ Year HODL Wave analyzes the age distribution of Bitcoin holdings to assess market sentiment. It tracks the percentage of Bitcoin that has remained untouched in wallets for at least a year, and helps to reflect the psychology of long-term holders. During market peaks, long-term holders often start selling their coins, causing the percentage of 1+ year coins to decline. Conversely, this percentage increases during bearish phases, indicating reduced selling pressure and longer term conviction. Investors can leverage this information by keeping an eye out for sharp decreases in the percentage of long-term held coins, which can often signal the approach of a significant price peak. While long-term holders have started moving coins, previous cycles suggest there is more to come. Terminal price: estimating potential cycle tops The Terminal Price indicator is a sophisticated on-chain metric that estimates potential price peaks by building on the concept of Transferred Price, derived from Coin Days Destroyed (CDD). High CDD values indicate that long-held coins are being moved, often coinciding with price rallies and corrections. Terminal price takes the average CDD across Bitcoin’s existence, multiplies it by 21 million, Bitcoin’s supply cap. Historically, the Terminal Price has reliably signaled the cycle tops, and currently sits at $188,000, and is rising along with Bitcoin’s price. This indicates that if this cycle follows historical trends, a peak above $200,000 is possible. Google search trends: measuring retail interest Google Trends, while not an on-chain indicator, provides valuable insight into public interest and retail sentiment. High search activity often corresponds to heightened enthusiasm and price surges, and while Bitcoin recently reached the $100,000 level, search activity remains surprisingly low. The current value of 38 is far below its previous peak of 100, which occurred during the 2021 bull run. This indicates that widespread retail euphoria has not yet arrived, and that there may still be more room to grow. As Bitcoin continues to climb, watch out for an increase in search activity which can signal a market peak. Bitcoin’s resurgence as a top-performing asset in 2024 highlights its resilience and increasing acceptance. However, navigating its volatile price action requires a keen understanding of the factors that drive its market cycles. By leveraging metrics such as exchange balances, MVRV Z-Score, 1+ Year HODL Wave, Terminal Price, and Google search trends, investors can make more informed decisions to capitalize on a bull market, while mitigating the inherent risks. Staying attuned to these indicators is vital for both seasoned and newcomer investors in 2025, as Bitcoin forges a new path to a new all time high.

Issued by the Dutch financial regulator AFM, this license positions MoonPay among the first companies to gain MiCA compliance , marking a major step for the integration of cryptocurrency into the broader financial system. The Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation officially takes effect today, offering a standardized approach for crypto-related services across EU member states. While some major players like Binance and Tether have faced challenges with MiCA’s strict compliance requirements, MoonPay views it as a strategic opportunity for growth. The platform will now expand its fiat-to-crypto and crypto-to-fiat services throughout Europe without regulatory friction. CEO Ivan Soto-Wright described the achievement as more than just a license, calling it a “pivotal step in solidifying the crypto industry’s role in the global economy.” He emphasized MoonPay’s commitment to fostering collaboration with regulators, businesses, and users to advance the adoption of digital assets. This approval comes amid a transformative period for the crypto sector in Europe. With exchanges already being directed to delist Tether’s USDT , platforms like Coinbase are preparing for significant operational changes. However, MoonPay is now well-positioned to navigate these shifts smoothly without requiring additional regulatory investments, such as opening new offices for compliance purposes. In addition to securing MiCA approval, MoonPay has been pursuing strategic growth initiatives. Reports suggest that the company has been in discussions to acquire Helio, a DeFi payments service, for $150 million. This acquisition aligns with MoonPay’s broader ambition to strengthen its foothold in the digital payments ecosystem. The company’s recent partnerships have also contributed to its upward momentum. In October, MoonPay announced a major collaboration with Ripple, which has already shown positive results following the approval of RLUSD in the US. November further reinforced MoonPay's growth trajectory as it surpassed its 2023 trading volume records. Looking ahead, MoonPay plans to capitalize on MiCA’s regulatory clarity to scale its operations across Europe. By aligning with the new legal framework, the company aims to lead the region in digital asset services, setting a benchmark for compliance and innovation in the crypto payments space.

38339369,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=376779,1735637656,"Bullish Bitcoin Forecasts, Shiba Inu Upcoming Projects, and More: Bits Recap Dec 31","TL;DR Bitcoin’s price briefly tumbled to a one-month low of $91,300 after MicroStrategy announced another crypto purchase. However, analysts and public figures predict a significant rally, with targets ranging from $340,000 to $1 million. Shiba Inu announced a 44-episode podcast for 2025, but some doubt its launch due to past unmet promises. Cardano (ADA) plunged to $0.84, but recent whale purchases hint at a potential price recovery and bullish momentum. BTC Price Explosion Incoming? Despite its brief spike to almost $100,000 around Christmas, Bitcoin (BTC) has been on a downtrend in the past few weeks. On December 30, its price dumped to a one-month low of around $91,300. Shortly after, the bulls managed to recover some of the losses, pushing the valuation to nearly $95,000. However, the past several hours offered another retreat, with BTC currently trading at around $93,700 (per CoinGecko’s data). BTC Price, Source: CoinGecko The asset’s latest pullback occurred shortly after MicroStrategy made another crypto purchase. As CryptoPotato reported , the company spent over $200 million to buy 2,136 BTC. Thus, its stash reached 446,000 BTC, which, at current rates, equals more than $41 billion. It is worth noting that this was the eight consecutive Monday MicroStrategy announced a Bitcoin purchase. While, in theory, the company’s actions reduce the asset’s supply on the open market, in many cases, the disclosures were followed by immediate corrections. Contrary to BTC’s shaky performance as of late , numerous industry participants and well-known figures remain optimistic that another bull run could be in the cards. For instance, the X user 0xNobler suggested that the asset’s next rally could start next month. “BTC has just reached its second breakout, and the next target is $340,000,” the analyst envisioned. The NBA legend Scottie Pippen was even more bullish, setting a target of $1 million. Interestingly, in September, he said that he had a dream with the anonymous creator of BTC, Satoshi Nakamoto, who told him that the cryptocurrency’s price would hit $84,650 on November 5 this year. The valuation surpassed that mark just a week later. SHIB to Start 2025 With a Bang Earlier this week, Shiba Inu’s lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama, revealed their intentions to launch a podcast next year. It will consist of 44 episodes and touch upon various aspects of the meme coin’s ecosystem. There will be no streaming on Wednesdays or Sundays, while the rest of the days of the week will be dedicated to particular topics. Mondays will focus on meme coins, Tuesdays on the Treat (TREAT) token (used as rewards in the ecosystem), Thursdays on tech discussions, Fridays on “shoutouts and follows ,” and Saturdays will be “all about spirituality.” “Next year will be epic, and I am so excited to share what we’ve built,” the developer said. Multiple users commenting on the post welcomed the idea. However, others cast doubts that the podcast will see the light of day, maintaining that the SHIB team made a similar promise years ago. What About ADA? Last but not least, we will touch upon Cardano’s ADA, whose price has slumped by 6% in the past week to its current $0.84. ADA Price, Source: CoinGecko Despite the underperformance, some factors suggest that a resurgence could be just around the corner . On December 29, the popular X user Ali Martinez claimed that whales purchased over 20 million ADA in 48 hours. Continuous efforts in that field will leave fewer tokens available on the open market, which, combined with non-declining demand, should push the price up. Additionally, the whales’ actions could encourage smaller investors to hop on the bandwagon, thus triggering an upward momentum for ADA.

The platform is about to unlock over 112 million SOL tokens worth over $2.14 billion. These are the tokens that were held by the FTX exchange and sold at a discounted price to firms like Figure Markets and Pantera Capital, which rather displayed a huge institutional interest in the token. Therefore, by unlocking nearly 23% of the circulating supply, a major impact on the SOL price rally is expected, hence placing the token within a decisive phase. Meanwhile, the price is currently within the same phase, which is expected to remain for another few days until it reaches the edge. The daily chart of Solana suggests the price is trading within an ascending triangle on a small scale within a decisive symmetrical triangle in a wider landscape. The price is trading along the ascending trend line and the technicals suggest a rise to the immediate resistance zone between $197 and $200.22 in a short while. After rising above the range, the price could achieve an important resistance at the 50-day MA at $205.13 before testing the major resistance of the decisive symmetrical triangle close to $210. There are fewer chances of a bearish pullback as the MACD levels display a drop in the selling pressure while the levels are about to undergo a bullish crossover. Besides, the token is experiencing a massive volume squeeze. Hence, a massive breakout in the buying volume could eventually elevate the levels to the crucial resistance at $216. Once these levels are secured, the upper resistance zone between $224 & $228 and $242 and $246 could be triggered, followed by a rise beyond the current ATH. The Solana chain has swelled heavily in 2024, offering tough competition to the big chains like Ethereum. Although Ethereum dominated public token sales, raising $552 million with 559 projects launched, Solana followed with $324 million and 152 projects. Despite this, Solana managed to outperform Ethereum in terms of transaction volume and count. The platform faced numerous outrages and regardless of this, the market participants remain bullish on Solana. As a result, the SOL price is expected to maintain an elevated trend and mark new highs in 2025. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

As 2024 draws to a close, all eyes look to 2025 and what it may hold. For the crypto market, the big question has been whether it would be able to sustain its impressive 2024 showing, particularly in Q4, in 2025.These lingering questions have led to a flurry of predictions from analysts and researchers, with the latest one coming from Galaxy Research. In this article, The Crypto Basic takes a look at Galaxy Research's 2025 crypto predictions with a focus on Bitcoin (BTC) , the largest crypto asset by market cap, Ethereum (ETH) , the second-largest crypto by market cap, widely regarded as the ""DeFi King,"" and Dogecoin (DOGE) , the largest meme coin by market cap.Here's how Galaxy Research sees BTC, ETH, and DOGE performing in 2025.Bitcoin (BTC)Galaxy Research expressed confidence that Bitcoin will continue its impressive run in 2025. The firm disclosed that it expects BTC to hit the $150,000 price point in the first half of 2025 and $185,000 in Q4, driven by continued adoption.For one, Galaxy Research believes the rapid uptake of spot Bitcoin ETFs will continue in 2025, tipping the assets under management in the investment vehicles to more than double from about $120 billion to $250 billion in 2025.At the same time, Galaxy Research expects continued adoption of the Bitcoin treasury model by more firms and countries. The firm believes at least five Nasdaq 100 companies and five countries will add the leading digital asset to their balance sheet in the new year.Further, Galaxy Research anticipates a Bitcoin DeFi boom in 2025, tipping the amount of coins locked in smart contracts and staking protocols to double.Amid all these factors, the firm asserts that Bitcoin will again be a top performer among global assets on a risk-adjusted basis in 2025.Ethereum (ETH)Ethereum will shake recent doldrums over the past two years to trade at new all-time highs in 2025, according to Galaxy Research. Specifically, the crypto research firm has tipped the asset to trade at new highs above the $5,500 price point in 2025. For context, the asset's all-time high price is around the $4,900 price point, and it is currently trading at around $3,350.Galaxy Research based its Ethereum prediction on expected regulatory clarity from the incoming Donald Trump administration . The firm tipped this clarity to offer tailwinds for DeFi and staking.https://twitter.com/glxyresearch/status/1872696358244892911For one, the firm expects more traditional finance firms to dabble with DeFi and Ethereum Layer 2 chains. At the same time, it also expects ETFs to soon be allowed to stake a portion of their ETH holdings, unlocking interest payments for investors, all of which it anticipates will drive demand for ETH.Amid these catalysts, Galaxy Research also expects Ethereum to gain some ground against Bitcoin, which it has underperformed since 2022. The firm tipped the ETH/BTC ratio to end 2025 above 0.06, up about 70% from current levels between 0.03 and 0.04. Still, the firm warns that this surge will be preceded by an initial dip below the 0.03 level.Dogecoin (DOGE)Meanwhile, Galaxy Research asserted that Dogecoin (DOGE) will follow up its over 245% gain in 2024 with a run to new highs in 2025. Specifically, the firm noted that the popular doggy-themed meme coin will clinch the long-coveted $1 price milestone and hit a $100 billion market capitalization in the new year.https://twitter.com/glxyresearch/status/1872696470224114068While there is no guarantee that Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin will hit these milestones in 2025, the odds of a favorable run appear to still be in the crypto market's favor with the incoming pro-crypto administration and continued albeit slower economic easing plans from the Federal Reserve.",POSITIVE,BTC | DOGE | ETH,BTC | DOGE | ETH | MARKET | RESEARCH,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/31/galaxy-research-predicts-bitcoin-to-hit-185000-ethereum-5500-and-dogecoin-1-in-2025/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=galaxy-research-predicts-bitcoin-to-hit-185000-ethereum-5500-and-dogecoin-1-in-2025,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png
38339275,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=668317,1735637440,Best Altcoins In 2025: Top Analyst Reveals His Picks,"With the new year just one day away, crypto analyst Alex Wacy (@wacy_time1) shared an overview of what he calls the best altcoins heading into 2025. The analyst, who has amassed an audience of over 190,000 followers on X, highlighted several projects that he believes have the potential to dominate in the potential coming altseason. Best Altcoins In 2025 He begins with Render (RNDR), describing it as a decentralized GPU rendering platform for AI, metaverse, and creative content. He maintained that “Render is poised to become a key player in the virtual future,” pointing to its $3.66 billion market capitalization as evidence of investor confidence. Following closely is Virtual, an AI-driven avatar initiative that is pegged at $3.41 billion in market cap, with Wacy touting Virtual as “the growth leader in 2024 in the virtual avatar sector” and predicting increasing adoption for metaverse, gaming, and social media applications. Wacy also turns his attention to SEKOIA, mentioning its focus on identifying and mentoring emerging AI talent. Although smaller in scale at a $94 million market cap, this autonomous AI investment agent uses advanced pattern recognition and quantifiable predictions to gain a foothold in a competitive space. Related Reading: Altcoins To Explode In Early 2025: Analyst Says “Grand Finale” Is Around The Corner Next in line for the best altcoins in 2025 is Pengu, which he calls “the official coin of Paddy Penguin, a major force in crypto.” Its substantial community and cultural traction reflect a hefty $2.28 billion market valuation, and its omnipresence in ETF ads combined with over 90 billion visits appear to confirm its cult-like following. The list of best altcoins continues with Clearpool (CPOOL), a Decentralized Capital Markets Ecosystem valued at $341 million that provides insured loans to institutional borrowers in the DeFi arena through a dynamic interest model. The analyst noted that Clearpool’s approach to decentralized lending could offer a unique avenue for strategic investors. He also spotlights Bittensor (Tao), a project intent on decentralizing AI solutions through an open ecosystem, weighed at $3.48 billion, and Hyperliquid (HYPE), a decentralized perpetuals exchange living on its own L1 with a $9.23 market cap. He describes Hype’s vision as “a high-speed, low-cost, transparent solution for perpetual futures,” though he advises caution, remarking that prospective investors should “research to understand its risks and potential.” Io.net, which sits at $397 million, is categorized as a decentralized GPU network that reduces costs for AI developers, while CFG (Centric) aims to bridge DeFi with real-world assets. This $162 million project focuses on stable returns generated from real fiat value rather than solely leveraging volatile crypto. Akash Network (AKT), valued at $746 million, is labeled by Wacy a “supercloud” that transforms cloud computing through a decentralized marketplace, and Ethena (ENA), at $2.69 billion, provides a synthetic dollar protocol on Ethereum, touted as “a crypto-native, bank-free solution for money.” Wacy’s list also featured Helium (HNT) with a $1.13 billion market cap, identified for its decentralized IoT network, and Griffain in the Solana ecosystem, with a $211 million market cap, delivering scalable DeFi solutions for token swaps while upholding transparency. Related Reading: Is Altcoin Season Here Already? VanEck Answers As Bitcoin Price Struggles Below $100,000 The analyst also highlights Grasso (GRASS) in his list of the best altcoins for 2025 and its $683 million market cap, describing its decentralized data collection network for AI training as both functional and user-friendly. VitaDAO (VITA) is in Wacy’s focus because of its community-governed DAO funding longevity research. Its compact $54 million market cap appears poised for growth as members actively engage in decision-making and ownership, signifying a communal approach to biotech research in crypto. Spectral, carrying a $194 million market cap, offers on-chain agents for easier application creation and includes a syntax tool that transforms natural language into Solidity. ETIGEN, or Energy Layer, at $170 million, extends novel concepts of restorative energy on Ethereum, and ONDO, with an impressive $2.83 billion market cap, aims to open up institutional-grade DeFi services and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. Wacy further singles out AIXTB, at $377M, which monitors crypto-related discussions via a proprietary engine to uncover high-sentiment opportunities, and Ether.fi (ETHFI), priced at $446M, which supports non-custodial ETH staking and DeFi integration. Throughout his breakdown, he underscored the cyclical nature of the crypto market, stating that these best altcoins “could see significant growth in 2025” once capital flow rotates away from Bitcoin and into high-potential altcoin narratives. His overall thesis hinges on what he perceives as a predictable pattern in every major market cycle. “Altcoins typically pumping when BTC Dominance starts a strong downtrend,” the analyst wrote. He cited the example from 2021, when Bitcoin’s dominance fell from around 73% to 40%, triggering a monumental rally for altcoins like SOL, ADA, and DOGE. Pointing out that current BTC dominance is about 55%, which he calls a “significant resistance zone,” he predicts a swift drop to 40% if a breakdown occurs. “As I mentioned before, my bet for the altseason is in the spring of 2025,” he said, while admitting that he also shares the common sentiment of disbelief that surrounds every cycle. “That’s okay, it means the market is doing a good job of ‘smoking people out.’ Patience friends, patience always pays off,” he concluded. At press time, the Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D) stood at 58.02%.

38351035,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=107048,1735637261,Expert Warns Against December 31 XRP Pump Expectation,"Analyst Vincent Van Code warns XRP enthusiasts against expecting a major December 31 price pump, advising a break during the holiday season. As the year draws to a close, the XRP community is rife with speculation about potential price movements. Many XRP enthusiasts are anticipating a major event today that could trigger a significant price ""pump"" for the digital asset. However, Vincent Van Code, a software engineer and voice in the community, has cautioned against putting too much faith in these predictions.Low Probability of a Major EventIn a tweet shared with his followers, Van Code expressed skepticism about the chances of a ""big"" XRP rally on December 31. According to him, the likelihood of such an event is extremely low—roughly 1 in 1,000. Moreover, he emphasized that there is little real evidence to suggest that a significant market move is imminent. Accordingly, he urged community members to consider the risks before making investment decisions based on the speculations. ""Is this gamble worth it?"" Van Code asked, pointing out the importance of being grounded in reality rather than chasing speculative trends without strong backing.Indeed, today, the last day of the year, the crypto market is largely bearish, and XRP is among the victims. XRP has dipped by 2% today, struggling to maintain the $2 price. It even briefly touched $1.9 before stabilizing back at $2.Holiday Season and Limited Market ActivityFurthermore, Van Code reminded the XRP community that it is the holiday season when many industry professionals are taking a break.

38339127,https://thecoinrise.com/trial-in-cftc-v-gemini-case-delayed-to-january-2025/,1735636903,Trial in CFTC v. Gemini Case Delayed to January 2025,"The highly anticipated trial between the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and Gemini Trust Company has been delayed, marking another turn in the ongoing legal battle. Originally scheduled for January 13, 2025, the trial will now commence on January 21, according to a December 30 filing by Judge Alvin Hellerstein in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Judge Hellerstein stated that no further delays would be permitted. Impact of Political Changes on Crypto Regulation The rescheduling places the trial just after the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, an event that could significantly influence the CFTC’s approach to cryptocurrency regulation. The political transition comes amidst heightened scrutiny of the crypto industry and raises questions about whether the new administration will adopt a more industry-friendly stance. Trump is reportedly considering replacing CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam with a pro-crypto figure, a move that could reshape the regulatory landscape. Behnam, whose term is set to expire in June 2026, has overseen significant enforcement actions against crypto entities, including FTX, Celsius, and Binance. The CFTC’s aggressive approach has already resulted in more than $17 billion in monetary relief during the 2024 fiscal year, primarily from actions against digital asset firms. The case against Gemini, initially filed in June 2022 , alleges that the company made false or misleading statements to the commission during its 2017 application to launch Bitcoin futures contracts. The CFTC seeks disgorgement of alleged ill-gotten gains, monetary penalties, and injunctions against further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act. A Crucial Moment for Crypto Regulation The timing of this trial could mark a critical juncture for the crypto sector. The composition of the CFTC, led by a five-member panel serving staggered terms, might gain additional authority if Congress passes legislation clarifying its jurisdiction over digital assets. With Trump’s administration signaling potential changes in leadership , the trial may serve as a barometer for the regulatory climate under the new government. As the crypto industry watches closely, the outcome of this case may set a precedent for how regulatory bodies like the CFTC navigate the balance between enforcement and fostering innovation.

Meta has been improving its artificial intelligence tools since last year. It introduced new AI products across different platforms like Facebook. This includes hundreds of thousands of characters created in July when they launched AI character-creation tools. These AI characters are currently private, but Meta expects them to be a standard feature on the platform in the years ahead. The profiles will operate very much like regular user accounts, Meta’s vice president of product for generative AI Connor Hayes told the Financial Times . He added that users would “have bios and profile pictures and be able to generate and share content powered by AI on the platform.” Meta plans to launch AI-generated text-to-video tools For the next two years, Meta will prioritize investments in AI development to make its platforms more engaging and fun. At the moment, users can use Meta’s AI for photo editing or creating an AI assistant. Furthermore, Meta is planning to launch new text-to-video tools that will enable content creators to be on AI-generated videos. However, experts are worried about the fast growth of the number of people using AI. They believe strong protections are needed to keep these AI accounts from spreading false information. Becky Owen, who was chief marketing officer at Billion Dollar Boy and previously head of Meta’s creator innovations team, warned, “Without robust safeguards, platforms risk amplifying false narratives through these AI-driven accounts.” She also fears that there will be too many AI profiles on the platform, which may attract less genuine content. As Owen pointed out, AI personas don’t have real-life experiences or emotions and are far less relatable than human creators. A Meta spokesperson pointed to the benefits of AI tools to Fox Business . He said its AI Studio allows anyone to create and have AI characters based on their interests. These characters can be “used for utility, fun or support,” helping in cooking, giving fashion advice, or providing daily affirmations. At the same time, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in April that it may take a few years to realize the full potential of their AI technology. He believes it’s been a wise investment, both for the company and its investors, as the “initial signs are quite positive here.” Land a High-Paying Web3 Job in 90 Days: The Ultimate Roadmap",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/meta-to-invest-in-ai/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/38339075.jpeg

38340645,https://invezz.com/?p=2412183,1735636173,Beyond Bitcoin: experts predict 2025’s hottest trends in crypto,"The cryptocurrency market, fueled by increased adoption and a significant influx of institutional capital in 2024, is poised for another year of dynamic growth and innovation. As the market matures and the Bitcoin bull run continues, industry experts are keenly anticipating the key trends that will define 2025. While meme coins and Artificial Intelligence (AI) tokens dominated discussions in 2024, Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization, AI agents, and Bitcoin as a treasury asset are expected to take center stage in the coming year. RWA and AI agents: a new dawn for crypto Bitwise, a prominent issuer of digital asset exchange-traded funds, predicts that the RWA sector will surge to over $50 billion in value in 2025, a significant increase from under $2 billion just three years ago. This is just one of their top 10 predictions for the coming year. Venture capital firm ParaFi and the Global Financial Markets Association (GFMA) share this optimistic outlook, forecasting RWA market growth to $2 trillion by 2030 and $16 trillion over the next five years, respectively. Edwin Mata, CEO and co-founder of Brickken, a leading RWA tokenization firm, told FXStreet in an exclusive interview: RWA is going to matter a lot to key players. Big players like BlackRock and JPMorgan are jumping in to provide just what we need for the RWA space to matter. I see AI agents embedded in the process. Bitcoin as treasury could be cemented in different countries. From the technological point of view: RWA, AI agents are two key narratives for the coming year. Meme coins: a trend to watch While RWA and AI are expected to be key driving forces, the meme coin phenomenon, which gained considerable traction in 2024, is also likely to remain relevant. A CoinGecko report identified meme coins, including those based on AI, Solana, and Base, as top-performing narratives of 2024. While their longevity is still in question, these digital assets have proven their ability to capture market attention. Dario Lo Buglio, Chief Technology Officer at Brickken, told FXStreet: Meme coins could fade away with some time or experience some growth next year. Maybe it can find a place for itself in the market. It is a trend, we welcome trends and embrace them. Edwin concurred, noting the emergence of meme coins as a distinct category alongside L1, L2, AI, and DePin projects, stating, “With meme coins it is a little bit like gambling, but it should not be considered the main narrative. It is just a matter of maturity in the market and it is a vertical and that’s all.” Bitcoin’s consolidation: a moment of calm? As the crypto market anticipates these emerging trends, Bitcoin is currently consolidating above $94,000, amidst a decline in open interest across derivatives exchanges and a reduction in the total number of BTC holders. This period of stability provides a brief respite before the next wave of innovation and potential growth.

38338789,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=635296,1735635969,Trouble catches up with US banks over ‘debanking’,"Banks, tariffs, Trump and Elon Musk take the yearly trophy home. 2024 is coming to an end, which means Donald Trump’s Inauguration as US President is just 20 days away. One of his biggest promises to the American people is to improve the country’s economy, and his sights are well set on the banking sector, which happens to be at the center of a controversy dubbed “debanking.” More than a year after Nigel Farage spoke about debanking in the United Kingdom, debates are heating up in the United States. Popular voices, including venture capitalist Marc Andreessen and tech magnate Elon Musk, have raised concerns about individuals and businesses losing access to the banking system, allegedly due to political affiliations or ties to cryptocurrency. Marc Andreessen, a co-founder of Netscape and influential investor, highlighted the issue during a late-November interview with podcast host Joe Rogan. Andreessen alleged that banks are targeting individuals on the political right, labeling them as “politically exposed” and severing financial ties. He further claimed that banks, under pressure from the Biden administration, have been systematically shutting down accounts tied to cryptocurrency-related businesses. US Banks’ tense relationship with crypto: Voices rise in volumes “ In the past four years, I know 30 tech company founders who have been debanked ,” Andreessen stated, igniting a wave of anecdotes from social media users reporting similar experiences. His comments added fuel to the fire, prompting widespread discussion about the politicization of banking practices. Elon Musk weighed in on the matter via X, calling debanking an example of government overreach. Musk argued that politically motivated account closures should be considered a federal crime. Forward this video to friends & family to understand just how evil the government has been pic.twitter.com/XgRnikMK6J — Kekius Maximus (@elonmusk) November 29, 2024 Meanwhile, Melania Trump’s claims that her bank terminated her account in the wake of the January 6 Capitol attack have further energized critics to amplify their claims. Reports that her son Barron was also denied a bank account have added to the financial bias “allegations.” On the political right, these actions have been collectively dubbed “Operation Choke Point 2.0,” referencing an Obama-era initiative that sought to limit banking access for controversial industries such as payday lending. David Sacks, the incoming AI and cryptocurrency czar for the Trump administration, has vowed to examine the issue. He gave his sentiments on the matter, saying, “ There are too many stories of people being hurt by Operation Choke Point 2.0 .” Is there something like too much bureaucracy? Critics of debanking argue that bureaucratic hurdles and regulatory pressures are driving banks to sever ties with certain clients. Since the financial crisis of 2008, banks have faced thousands of pages of new regulations and billions of dollars in fines, leading to a more risk-averse approach. When banks terminate client relationships, the reasoning is often vague, fueling speculation that they are making politically motivated decisions. Regulators, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), insist that they do not direct banks to drop specific customers. However, in 2022, the FDIC advised banks to inform them of any plans to engage with cryptocurrency businesses, which begs the question of whether account closures are a matter of choice or coincidence. Edward Fishman, a former State Department official and author of Chokepoints: American Power in the Age of Economic Warfare , stated, “ With crypto becoming more intertwined with the formal financial system and banking sector, banks are petrified of running afoul of sanctions .” AI and crypto adoption growth is slow: Is Biden responsible? The debanking debate is just one aspect of broader concerns about government overreach. Critics of the Biden administration argue that its actions have stifled emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI) and cryptocurrency, by exploiting regulatory chokepoints . Marc Andreessen revealed that he was warned against funding AI startups during a meeting with White House officials earlier this year. Administration aides allegedly indicated plans to create a “regulatory moat” around select AI companies they could control. Some officials reportedly went as far as suggesting that certain areas of mathematics could be classified, echoing Cold War-era restrictions on physics research. These claims have raised alarm about the potential politicization of technological development. In 2022, the Biden administration reportedly issued an executive order supporting the exploration of a central bank digital currency (CBDC). Accompanying this move was a white paper advocating for policies to “limit or eliminate” Bitcoin mining . By 2024, the administration implemented a 30% excise tax on electricity used by Bitcoin miners and imposed mandatory energy audits on large mining operations. These measures sparked lawsuits from crypto companies, which ultimately succeeded in court. Critics argue that these actions were designed to centralize control over digital assets and restrict miners’ access to essential resources such as energy. “Unplugging,” as it has been termed, mirrors the alleged debanking strategy to control cryptocurrency through indirect means. Trump’s administration promises reforms President-elect Donald Trump’s incoming administration has vowed to address the debanking scandal and related issues. David Sacks has called for an investigation into regulatory agencies, including the FDIC, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and the Federal Reserve’s prudential regulatory division. Forward this video to friends & family to understand just how evil the government has been pic.twitter.com/XgRnikMK6J — Kekius Maximus (@elonmusk) November 29, 2024 Former Comptroller of the Currency Brian Brooks has also suggested revisiting “fair access” rules that would require banks to provide services unless they have a legitimate financial reason to terminate a relationship. The Trump team proposed reforms that aim to ensure neutrality in banking practices and safeguard access to financial services for lawful activities. Critics of debanking hope these measures will prevent further weaponization of the banking system and foster an environment of fair access for all industries, regardless of political or regulatory pressures.

A Comprehensive Review,"As the cryptocurrency industry continues to evolve, users attach immense importance to security, transparency, and reliability of crypto solutions. In this review, we’ll delve into the security features of NOW Wallet , a self-custodial wallet developed by its parent non-custodial exchange ChangeNOW , along with its trustworthiness as revealed by user feedback. Security Features of NOW Wallet 1. Non-Custodial Structure By design, NOW Wallet is a self-custodial wallet, meaning users maintain complete control over their private keys and digital assets. The NOW Wallet’s non-custodial feature grants users complete control over their funds. Everything is stored on the user’s devices. No private keys, backup files, or any user data are stored on the server. Also, no third party can access private information. 2. Mnemonic Phrase Encryption Users are provided with a 12 or 24-word mnemonic recovery phrase. This comes in handy in case users lose access to their wallet and need to recover it. 3. Three-Layer Encryption NOW Wallet features a three-layer encryption process to safeguard sensitive data like private keys in addition to biometric authentication. NOW Wallet users can pair the traditional pin-based access with fingerprint or facial scans for extra protection. 4. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) NOW Wallet offers two-factor authentication (2FA) as an additional security layer for Pro accounts (available in free and paid plans). This feature helps reduce the likelihood of unauthorized access by requiring a second verification step. 5. Custom Visibility Settings Additionally, NOW Wallet includes one interesting and unique security feature. This function allows users to adjust visibility and access. They can opt to display certain currencies on their main screen and leave out others. Users can also hide wallets with zero balances or those flagged as scams. Market Reputation and Ecosystem Reliability Backed by ChangeNOW’s reputation as a solid non-custodial exchange platform, NOW Wallet enjoys widespread trust as well. On Google Play alone, NOW Wallet has a rating of 4.4/5 based on 2.45K reviews, with over 50,000+ downloads. User Reviews and Feedback NOW Wallet consistently receives positive reviews on app stores and crypto forums.

For example: One of the users highlighted the wallet’s reliability, saying it ‘’always works for me, even when other wallets have issues.’’ They also noted its compatibility with platforms like PayPal, making it easy to send crypto, sell it, and get cash. Another user liked how “simple, solid, and secure” the wallet is, especially with blue-chip coin support.

Barron referred to the recent surge in activity as a “perfect storm” for XRP and its underlying technology. According to Barron’s, trustlines on XRPL have seen a dramatic increase since December as more users begin to realize the network’s potential. Trustlines allow users to establish lending relationships on XRPL, and their growth is often seen as a sign of expanding adoption and usage. “In December, trustlines started to explode because people started to realize what was going on,” Barron said. According to the analyst, this increase in Trustlines was accompanied by two other key indicators of XRPL’s growing ecosystem: DEX Volume: Decentralized exchange (DEX) activity on XRPL has been on the rise, reflecting increased trading and token issuance. Active Addresses: The number of active addresses continues to increase, indicating continued user participation and network activity. Related News: Onchain Data Reveals: This Cryptocurrency Whale Made $49 Million in Profits on One Altcoin Today, Now Buys Another Altcoin Barron’s also noted a wave of profit-taking by former XRP holders earlier in the year, following a period of significant price appreciation. However, this trend changed in December as new participants entered the market, resulting in a revival in activity. “A lot of old holders basically sold their XRP because they saw that they were making a profit for the first time. So what happened here in early December? Boom, trust lines started to explode,” he said. Barron emphasized that these developments pave the way for something much bigger: “What you have here is a perfect storm that is starting to form with XRP and where this technology is going.” *This is not investment advice.

This token is heating up for the kind of thousand-fold gains that define meme coin success. Traders can get in early to see gains. DOGEN is the new alpha of the Solana blockchain, standing shoulder-to-shoulder with heavyweights like BONK, WIF, and Popcat, all of which hit 1000% gains at their peak.

BONK faces volatility BONK is a Shiba Inu-inspired memecoin on the Solana blockchain, created to redistribute power within the ecosystem by moving away from venture capital dominance. It gained widespread recognition after a 100% surge following its Coinbase listing, solidifying its position as a community-driven token. A hallmark of BONK’s approach was the airdrop of 50% of its supply to participants in Solana’s NFT and DeFi sectors, further integrating it into the blockchain’s ecosystem. BONK is currently trading at $0.00003108, reflecting a 3.9% decrease in the last 24 hours. With a market capitalization of $2.36b, it ranks #42 among cryptocurrencies.

As a meme coin, WIF prioritizes community engagement and viral appeal, aiming to capture attention through fun and relatability rather than traditional utility. Joining the trend of dog-themed tokens, WIF brings its unique character to the ever-popular meme coin space. Over the past week, WIF has shown a 4.8% loss, currently priced at $1.82. Ranked at #63, its market cap has reached $1.81b supported by a trading volume of $390.22m over 7 days. Conclusion DOGEN emerges as a meme token for those seeking luxury and success. With BONK and WIF showing less short-term potential, DOGEN is building a community of market leaders. It offers real benefits like exclusive campaigns for early adopters.

Trump the Grinch (TRUMPGRI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPGRI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump the Grinch can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump the Grinch could become the next viral memecoin. Trump the Grinch launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump the Grinch on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump the Grinch by entering its contract address – 93BLFCVkzBwnSUUjiyaVRQSpjEvaXdZe3oS3iyHnhind – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPGRI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trump-the-grinch-trumpgri-solana-memecoin-to-skyrocket-19000-before-exchange-listings-as-doge-and-shiba-inu-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Consequently, some Ripple whales have shifted attention to a new and innovative AI altcoin, RCO Finance (RCOF). RCOF is capturing investor interest with cutting-edge AI Robo-advisor, providing investors with a personalized investment strategy to navigate the volatile crypto market. Again, analysts predict that the RCOF AI altcoin is poised for a 21,679% ROI, further driving the Ripple whales to the tokens Presale, rivaling XRP price momentum. XRP Price: Decline in Focus as Ripple Whales Shift Focus The crypto market is undergoing uncertainty, with most tokens in the red, including the XRP price . XRP, the native token of Ripple Labs, is facing a notable price decline after a bearish price action. At press time, Ripple’s XRP price is trading at $2.16, a 5.8% decline in the last 24 hours. Investors speculate that the current downturn may result from the anticipated unlock of 1 billion XRP tokens on Jan 1, 2025. Technical analysis shows that Ripple’s XRP price failed to hold support at $2.20. Analysts predict that if the XRP price closes below $2.15 on the daily charts, its next support could be $1.88. As the XRP price struggles, Ripple whales have increased buying pressure on an emerging AI altcoin, RCO Finance, for its groundbreaking utility and high growth potential. RCO Finance: The AI Altcoin Attracting Ripple whales to its Presale Ripple’s XRP price is facing bearish momentum as an emerging AI altcoin, RCOF, is revolutionizing the DeFi space with real utility and advanced AI capabilities. This sets it apart from other traditional cryptocurrencies, including XRP. At the heart of RCOF AI altcoin is the AI Robo-advisor, which analyses vast market data to deliver personalized investment strategies based on unique user profiles. This helps investors minimize risks and maximize profits, an important advantage as the XRP price remains volatile. Whether you are a new or experienced trader, the AI Robo-advisor gives you a hands-free experience, monitoring the markets and adjusting your portfolio in real-time based on market performance and user profile. This makes the RCOF AI altcoin stand out from Ripple. Another feature that makes the RCOF AI altcoin stand out from XRP is the access to over 120,000 tradable assets spanning 12,500 classes. This includes bonds, shares, ETFs, forex, and real-world assets such as real estate and commodities. Investors have an opportunity to invest in real-world assets through tokenization. They can invest in portions of high-end properties that traditionally were reserved for large investors. Through fractional ownership, investors can take advantage of the lucrative real estate, which also helps diversify their investment portfolio, a feature not available in Ripple’s XRP. Also, with the RCOF AI altcoin, investors can enjoy leverage over select assets of up to 1000x, a rare feature in the digital currency market. This enables investors to yield high profits with small stakes, making the RCOF AI altcoin a compelling alternative for investors looking for higher returns than the current XRP price trends might offer. Finally, the RCOF AI altcoin prioritizes transparency and security. By using blockchain technology, the platform records transaction history on an immutable ledger. Again, SolidProof has rigorously audited the RCO Finance smart contracts to confirm adherence to high-security standards. This helps boost investor confidence amidst uncertainty around the XRP price decline. RCO Finance Presale: Limited Opportunity for 21,679% ROI As the XRP price struggles to regain momentum, Ripple whales are flocking to the RCO Finance presale . The Presale is currently in stage 4, with the RCOF tokens priced at $0.077, with only one stage left before listing. Analysts predict the RCOF AI altcoin will jump to $16.68 to record a staggering 21,679% ROI. This projection is attracting savvy investors, including Ripple whales, who want to diversify their portfolios with a high-growth potential token. Tokens are selling out fast, with over 52% of tokens sold out in stage 4, showing growing investment demand. Don’t miss out on investing in the RCOF AI altcoin revolution today.

38338975,https://invezz.com/?p=2411730,1735634694,How Bitcoin ETFs helped disrupt traditional finance in 2024,"The rapid rise of Bitcoin ETFs, led by BlackRock’s IBIT, has not just broken records but fundamentally shifted the dynamics of institutional investment. Moving beyond the numbers, this development reflects a profound change in how major financial players approach cryptocurrencies. From initial scepticism to wide acceptance, Bitcoin ETFs have become a gateway for institutions to navigate the volatile crypto market while embracing its potential. This growing trust in regulated cryptocurrency products is redefining the relationship between traditional finance and digital assets. How Bitcoin ETFs bridged the trust gap For years, Bitcoin was seen as too volatile and unregulated for institutional portfolios. However, the introduction of ETFs like BlackRock’s IBIT has transformed this perception by offering a structured and regulated entry point. Unlike direct cryptocurrency investments, ETFs mitigate risks through clear regulatory oversight and robust infrastructure, providing institutions with a safe way to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s performance. BlackRock’s entry into the Bitcoin market was particularly symbolic, as it signalled a broader shift among institutional investors. Larry Fink, once a vocal critic of Bitcoin, has since championed its potential as “digital gold.” This pivot illustrates how regulated products have softened resistance and encouraged deeper participation from traditional financial entities. The ETF effect on market credibility and accessibility Bitcoin ETFs have done more than legitimise cryptocurrency—they have also made it more accessible. By simplifying the process of investing in Bitcoin through familiar financial instruments, ETFs like IBIT have demystified digital assets for cautious investors. This accessibility has been instrumental in driving adoption among wealth managers, pension funds, and even central banks. Moreover, the rise of Bitcoin ETFs has reduced market fragmentation. Investors no longer need to navigate unregulated exchanges or worry about the security risks associated with direct crypto purchases. Instead, they can rely on established ETF providers to handle custody, compliance, and reporting. This streamlined approach has attracted billions in capital, creating a ripple effect that has stabilised Bitcoin’s market perception and expanded its global footprint. A step toward integrating crypto with traditional finance The success of Bitcoin ETFs underscores a deeper trend: the integration of digital assets into the traditional financial ecosystem. Far from being seen as competitors, cryptocurrencies are now increasingly viewed as complementary assets. Bitcoin ETFs have catalysed this shift by acting as a bridge, allowing institutional investors to dip their toes into the crypto waters without committing to the complexities of blockchain technology. This shift has broader implications for the financial industry. The growing popularity of ETFs has paved the way for discussions about broader cryptocurrency adoption, from tokenised assets to blockchain-based financial products. As regulators and institutions continue to collaborate, the lines between traditional finance and digital assets are expected to blur further, creating new opportunities for innovation and growth.

Now, a new token that is even dubbed as Solana killer has emerged with its unique focus on Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization and the momentum in the presale where it is closing its stages ahead of schedule. Currently, in stage 11 of its presale, the token is Rexas Finance (RXS), where in this stage, it is priced at 0.175, with the next stage hiking to $0.2. Analysts are bold enough that this token is poised for a 34,200% ROI in 2025. Unlock Trillions: How Rexas Finance is Revolutionizing Investment with RWA Tokenization | Join the RXS Presale Before Prices Surge! Rexas Finance’s primary interest is in RWA tokenization, which brings together the world of traditional assets with the space of blockchain technology. This new method enables investors to tokenize and trade physical products like real estate, art, and commodities, making them liquid in an area that has historically been illiquid. The potential market for RWA tokenization is trillions of dollars. Rexas Finance seeks to grab a portion of this market through a platform where tokenizing assets becomes seamless. The Rexas Token Builder is one of many tools investors can use to build tokens without technical expertise. As a game changer, this ease of use allows seasoned and new investors to get up and running. But even as Rexas Finance heads into the following stages of its presale, it has already raised an impressiv e $33,311,514 o f the expected $41 million. RXS sold out at 381,063,515 tokens, a total supply of 425 million, clearly showing that RXS is in high demand. However, the token is perhaps most attractive given the current price of $0.175, a price point at which investors can take advantage of the anticipated growth trajectory of this token. https://twitter.com/rexasfinance/status/1871258815976595608 Its strategic pricing model has aroused many people’s interest in the presale period. Early phases saw RXS begin at just around $0.03, increasing as demand grows. The next stage price, set at $0.200, means early investors will profit from massive gains. Secure & Set to Soar: Rexas Finance’s RXS Token Could Skyrocket 34,200%—Join Now! Certik, the leading blockchain security firm with impressively high standards, audited Rexas Finance to the fullest. This audit improves the project’s credibility and ensures that potential investors have their assets protected by a secure framework. https://twitter.com/rexasfinance/status/1857692542290059502 In addition, Rexas Finance is available on platforms like CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, which enhances its visibility and trustworthiness in the crypto world. These things expose potential investors to Rexas Finance. According to the price predictions, this token’s value can increase by up to 34,200%, reaching nearly $60 per token in 2025. The increasing demand for RWA tokenization solutions has led to such projections. Additionally, the growth of RXS is expected to follow the trend in the crypto market as altcoins become the centre of discussion in the cryptocurrency industry. As Rexas Finance continues to push the envelope of what can be accomplished in Web3, including the introduction of AI capabilities like Rexas GenAI for automating NFT generation, the platform is poised to claim a large slice of the fast-growing pie of digital currencies. Conclusion For investors who joined Solana early when its presale started, they enjoyed a 17,100% ROI in their portfolio. Those who missed got another chance with the RXS or Solana Killer for a 34,200% ROI. With its presale closing before schedule and audit and its focus on Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization, this token presents a unique opportunity for savvy investors. In stage 11 of its presale, where one RXS goes for $0.175, there has never been a better time to consider investing in Rexas Finance.

38337835,https://crypto.news/?p=14323464,1735634201,"OKX achieves milestone year in global expansion and innovation, despite challenges","Record app downloads, millions of users, and new in-app features mark the year of recovery and drive OKX’s success. With millions of new users and an impressive 122% year-over-year rise in app downloads, OKX’s 2024 has been a transformative year characterized by resilience and innovation. The CEO of OKX , Star Xu, stated , “Despite the challenges, 2024 remains a year of focus, innovation, and resilience.” The company highlighted major achievements, including an increase of 991% global growth in OKX Wallet users by December and a 20x increase in daily trading volume on its decentralized exchange. This expansion underscores the crypto sector’s overall revival, which the CEO called “an important turning point for the industry.” Despite the ongoing success, OKX has encountered several challenges , especially in the areas of platform security and regulatory oversight. Following reports of security flaws, OKX recently saw huge money withdrawals, with consumers taking out almost $837 million in a single week. You might also like: Sophisticated deepfake AI hack nets over $2m in stolen funds from OKX user Questions over the platform’s general security mechanism and stories of SIM swap attacks, in which hackers obtained access to users’ accounts, were the catalysts for these withdrawals. Unlike decentralized exchanges, where users retain control over their trades and assets, OKX which was established in 2017 is a centralized exchange, which means it is run by a single organization. A more streamlined and user-friendly experience is made possible by centralization, but it also implies that OKX itself stores and manages user funds and personal data. A single hack may undermine the entire platform, impacting hundreds or even millions of users, and making centralized exchanges more susceptible to attacks. Decentralized exchanges, on the other hand, divide authority among multiple participants, which can provide extra security because there isn’t a single central target for an attack. The drawback is that DEXs typically have more intricate procedures and user interfaces. For OKX, this concentration of power has turned out to be both a benefit and a drawback. Although it provides more efficient services due to centralization, recent security breaches show that it also makes the platform a prime target for hackers and places the onus of user protection squarely on the platform. You might also like: OKX Ventures officially announces investment in USUAL To improve the user experience, OKX introduced a streamlined “simple mode” in its app for intuitive trading, enhanced cross-chain support across 100+ blockchains, and added over 200 new features to its services. “This year, we’re working to optimize the use of the app and enhance the seamless experience of crypto assets on OKX,” said the CEO. In 2024, OKX accelerated its global expansion by establishing localized operations in Brazil, Singapore, and Australia. The company’s dedication to compliance and transparency was demonstrated by securing four significant regulatory licenses in key regions: Singapore, the UAE, the European Economic Area, and Australia. With an industry-first Proof of Reserves tool and close to 500 compliance specialists, OKX continues to set the standard for protecting user confidence. “To date, more than 2 million users have used our Proof of Reserves verification tool,” said the CEO. As OKX continues its expansion into new international markets, its rebranding and focus on global compliance highlight the growing competition among centralized exchanges. Competitors of OKX, such as Binance , have also faced regulatory challenges. However, despite ongoing regulatory scrutiny, OKX remains a major player in the space, continuing to dominate as one of the largest exchanges in the world. This intensifies the competition for market share, with OKX aiming to strengthen its position and capitalize on its recent expansion initiatives.

Speaking at a high-profile New Year’s event hosted by the nation’s top political advisory body, Xi declared the economy “stable and progressing,” emphasizing that employment remained steady and inflation was under control. This comes as policymakers in Beijing have been rolling out aggressive measures since September to keep the economy on course. Economists had pegged the growth rate at 4.8%. Manufacturing drives recovery, but consumers hold back China’s industrial output proved to be a bright spot in November, surging 5.4% year-on-year. The country’s high-tech manufacturing sector took the lead, posting an impressive 9.1% growth in the third quarter. But while factories are humming, consumer spending tells a different story. Retail sales hit RMB 4.38 trillion (about $608.82 billion) in November, reflecting only a 3% increase. This slowdown shows the ongoing caution among Chinese consumers who are tightening their wallets amid economic uncertainties. Weak domestic demand remains a major drag on the economy, with muted consumer confidence and sluggish recovery in household spending. On the investment side, fixed asset investment grew by 3.3% between January and November. Sectors outside the troubled real estate market posted stronger growth, with investments up by 7.7%. Still, these gains haven’t been enough to fully counterbalance the fallout from the country’s persistent property market woes. The real estate sector, long a pillar of China’s economic engine, remains stuck in a prolonged slump despite government intervention. Inflation flirts with deflation China’s inflation barely moved in November, with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) creeping up just 0.2%. People are now worried about deflation, and it’s not helping that producer prices keep dropping. That’s slashing company profits and putting the brakes on the economy. Overall unemployment in China is holding steady at 5.1%, which sounds okay, but youth unemployment is still a disaster. It’s killing people’s confidence and making them spend less. And then there’s the property market. No matter how much help the government throws at it, it’s still a total disaster and dragging the economy down even more.

In two to three years, he believes that a Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem will eclipse other DeFi markets. He is also looking to launch a historic partnership with Ripple, which could see the RLUSD stablecoin come to the Cardano network . Many of these integrations could fuel the next bullish wave for ADA but Remittix (RTX) is the one that’s caught investors’ attention, with financial experts already describing RTX as the “new XRP.” Cardano Founder Lays Out Bitcoin DeFi Plan and RLUSD Integration One of the biggest untapped markets in all of crypto is DeFi on Bitcoin. Despite many of the early attempts not achieving its full potential, Cardano (ADA) founder, Charles Hoskinson, announced plans to bring DeFi to Bitcoin next year. Hoskinson says Bitcoin DeFi space is a “sleeping giant” and he believes it has a huge untapped potential. He believes that the DeFi on Bitcoin could overtake that of other top DeFi projects in 2-3 years. He announced that IOG will begin focusing on this ambitious plan, starting with a demo around May 2025. Hoskinson adds that IOG will collaborate with Fair Gate Labs and other top ecosystem players, to attempt to unlock the potential Bitcoin DeFi market . In a live video , Hoskinson has also hinted at the possibility of a Ripple partnership. He suggested that the Midnight sidechain, focused on privacy, could include XRP. Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin was also discussed as a possible inclusion into Cardano’s ecosystem. Hoskinson said Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin can be used in many ways in the Cardano ecosystem . Ripple CTO David Schwartz and the company’s CEO Brad Grillinghouse are people Hoskinson said he had been talking to. These are major events to look forward to, leading crypto analysts to hold optimistic views about the Cardano coin . While ADA has struggled on the monthly chart, dropping by more than 25% per CoinMarketCap , the likes of Yesreel believe that the Cardano price could rise from $0.80 to hit $4 in this bull cycle. Remittix (RTX), the “New XRP” To Outshine ADA While ADA has established its place among the top crypto coins, investors have been pivoting to Remittix (RTX) , which they have named the “new XRP.” Remittix shares some semblance to Ripple, operating in the $190 trillion cross-border payment market, but has more advanced features. Remittix is changing the way you send money, creating the perfect bridge between crypto and conventional payment methods. On Remittix, you can receive over 50+ fiat currencies and instantly convert them into fiat. When you convert your crypto into fiat on Remittix, you can pay them into your bank account and expect to receive them on the same day. Remittix supports 30+ fiat currencies, giving the DeFi project a wider range than the likes of Wise and Stripe. Remittix also offers flat fees without extra charges for FX and wire transactions. Being secured with the best encryption techniques, and taking advantage of thorough code reviews from BlockSAFU, the smart contracts created on Remittix get the best protection of user assets and data. Because of these features, Remittix has been predicted to replace Ripple, making RTX one of the best cryptos to buy now . RTX has increased from $0.015 to $0.0167 in presale while raising over $816k in just a few days. Cardano vs. Remittix: Which is the Best Crypto Investment? The plans unveiled by Hoskinson put the Cardano network and ADA in a great position to record huge increases. However, Remittix is not just newer but is also entering a much bigger market. With the growth rate of the platform, RTX could peak above $1 before ADA hits $4.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Current bearish trends are drawing PEPE and SUI holders to the FXGuys token. Table of Contents PEPE suffers due to the Fed’s stance on crypto for 2025 SUI slows down after price pump FXGuys: A first-of-its-kind FX trading platform FXG could be the hottest presale token of 2024 December has seen the crypto market follow a bearish trend, starting from the top cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC). The downtrend has not spared Pepe (PEPE) and Sui (SUI). Investors are thus seeking ways to diversify their portfolios and preserve capital. The FXGuys (FXG) presale token has shown immense promise with its fast-selling presale, attracting more investors. PEPE suffers due to the Fed’s stance on crypto for 2025 PEPE has taken a hit as the crypto market continues to trend downward. In the past seven days, the PEPE coin price has fallen by 3.35% to $0.000019. The Federal Reserve Chairman recently made it clear that the US Central Bank did not intend to involve itself in government efforts to stockpile large amounts of Bitcoin. This is an additional blow to the crypto market, on top of the hints by the Fed that there will be fewer rate cuts next year as inflation remains above the 2% target. Since then, Bitcoin has struggled, which has spilled over to altcoins like PEPE. The PEPE coin price consolidation is expected to continue. Analysts say PEPE might remain around the $0.000020 range for the rest of the year. SUI slows down after price pump Despite the general bearish trend, SUI has not experienced dramatic price decreases. The SUI price has decreased 11% in the past week, currently trading at $4.12. In SUI’s case, the token is experiencing a period of price consolidation after reaching an all-time high of $4.90 on December 16, 2024. The current trading volume and liquidity indicate sustained interest from buyers, which supports price stability. However, the absence of substantial catalysts has limited further upward movement, resulting in a sideways trading pattern. Analysts project that the current SUI price consolidation will restrict the token below $6, possibly ending 2024 at $5.94.

The crypto market cap plunged 1.45% in the past day to $3.24 trillion as Bitcoin hovers at $92.7K. While altcoins appear to suffer the most, some investors have capitalized on the discounted values to dip-buy. On-chain data highlights significant accumulations behind Peanut the Squirrel, a Solana-based meme token. PNUT whale activity and price performance According to Spot on Chain, a large-scale crypto investor spent around $6.1 million to acquire 10 million PNUT tokens from Binance on December 30. Spot On Chain @spotonchain · Follow Big $Pnut accumulation detected!Whale “FFDAa” withdrew 10M $Pnut ($6.1M), ~1% of the total supply, from #Binance 20 minutes ago.Notably, this marks the whale’s first $Pnut accumulation.The whale has since transferred nearly all $Pnut tokens to wallet “76yGJ,” now ranked as… 5:23 AM · Dec 30, 2024 351 Reply Copy link Read 18 replies The transaction attracted attention as it came amidst PNUT’s plummeting price. Furthermore, this is the first time the whale accumulated the meme token, raising speculations about Peanut the Squirrel’s future potential. Meanwhile, the investor sent all the purchased PNUT to another wallet, making it the 6th largest no-CEX PNUT holding address. Whale activity remains crucial in predicting market directions. Large-scale investors often purchase tokens with near-term rallying potential. Moreover, the latest PNUT accumulation occurred as prices traversed weekly lows. That highlights strategic moves to capitalize on reduced costs. The altcoin soared following the accumulation, jumping from $0.58 to $0.72 within hours. PNUT trades at $0.63 after sliding from its daily peaks. Chart by Coinmarketcap The altcoin demonstrates significant selling momentum, reflecting potential downward continuations before stable revivals. Meanwhile, trends such as whale accumulation suggest potential market shifts in bullish favor. Holding the vital support barrier at $0.50 will likely catalyze significant recoveries. With its prevailing performance, PNUT’s price teases an exodus from a descending trend line. That could open the path toward the psychological mark at $1. Increased buyer activity at this level would drive the meme token to its ATH of $2.3. However, broad market trends would be crucial in driving PNUT’s performance ahead. Experts predict bullish resumptions in Q1 2025, citing developments like the United States’ incoming pro-crypto leadership. Donald Trump promised a friendly environment for US crypto investors during his campaigns. The asset class struggled under Gary Gensler as the SEC chair amid unclear regulations. However, the Trump administration has promised to end such trends by appointing pro-crypto individuals to monitor the sector. For instance, the president-elect picked Paul Atkins after Gensler’s resignation. Furthermore, analysts expect a rebound after the recent dip. Michael van de Poppe forecasts imminent uptrends for cryptocurrencies as the correction phase ends. Michaël van de Poppe @CryptoMichNL · Follow There we go.

What’s Next?","XRP trading volumes on South Korea's biggest crypto exchanges have overtaken those of bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) in a sign of flurried interest that often precedes price volatility.  Total trading volume against the won on UpBit, Bithumb and Korbit, the country’s largest exchanges by volumes and users, topped $800 million in dollar value in the past 24 hours.  XRP registered over $200 million in volumes on Bithumb and $600 million on UpBit, with bitcoin (BTC) trading volumes less than half of those on both exchanges. Interest in other assets, such as dogecoin (DOGE) or ether (ETH) was even lower, reaching just a 10th of the demand seen for XRP.  A wild increase in trading volume is often a harbinger of increased volatility because it may be a sign that market participants are anticipating developments that warrant them taking speculative positions.  High volumes might precede a price breakout if those positions support a strong move through resistance or support levels. They could also signal a price peak or trough, potentially leading to a reversal if the volume represents panic selling or aggressive buying at perceived undervalued or overvalued levels.  South Korean traders are known for pushing euphoric rallies on tokens, contributing to buying pressure and possibly influencing prices.  XRP has emerged as a popular token among Korean traders this year, with political developments often causing a sudden move in XRP markets locally, as a CoinDesk analysis previously showed.  Tuesday’s volume bump comes as a South Korean court issued an arrest warrant for President Yoon Suk Yeol early Tuesday.

The story begins with Pepeto’s quest to collect six essential documents symbolizing Power, Energy, Precision, Efficiency, Technology, and Optimization. These documents form the bedrock of Pepeto’s mission to bring structure and utility to the meme coin space. However, the tale takes an intriguing turn when Lucifer, later known as Pepe, took the first four documents to launch an incomplete project that gained fame but lacked true utility. With the final pieces in hand — Technology and Optimization — Pepeto has returned, not just to complete the narrative but to create a platform capable of supporting the next generation of meme coins. Energizing the community through engagement https://twitter.com/Pepetocoin/status/1871601254537076947 Pepeto’s influence continues to expand with a newly announced five-step campaign aimed at mobilizing its growing Pepeto Army. Already revealing three steps, the initiative encourages followers to amplify the project’s presence by sharing and tagging its content across social platforms.

This comes as Pepeto prepares to release the alpha version of PepetoSwap, its exchange designed to adopt upcoming meme coins and facilitate seamless cross-chain trading. Roadmap and long-term value Staying true to its roadmap, Pepeto successfully completed all of its Q4 2024 milestones, including upgrading its official website. The team is now advancing its Q1 2025 roadmap, focusing on launching the PepetoSwap exchange and expanding its bridge technology. With utilities like zero-fee trading, a token listing platform, and staking rewards yielding an impressive 474% return, Pepeto is laying the foundation for widespread adoption in the anticipated 2025 bull run. Rumors and vision: A comeback story Adding depth to Pepeto’s appeal are rumors suggesting that an ex-co-founder of Pepe is behind the project. Allegedly sidelined during Pepe’s inception, this individual has returned to complete the vision that Pepe lacked. With a comprehensive approach blending storytelling and utility, Pepeto positions itself as a leader capable of shaping the future of meme coins. Priced at $0.000000100 and boasting over 50,000 followers across platforms, Pepeto has already raised $3 million in its presale phase.

Bitcoin (BTC) led the charge, propelling the industry to nearly $4 trillion in valuation before a market correction. Earlier in the year, Bitcoin hit the long-awaited $100,000 milestone, eventually settling at about $92,700 in the final hours of the year during the mid-London session. Bitcoin’s price surge and the crypto market’s broader growth were driven by increased mainstream adoption , particularly from institutional giants like MicroStrategy Inc. (NASDAQ: MSTR) and Metaplanet Inc. (Tokyo: 3350) . A game-changing moment in 2024 was the U.S. approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, leading to the purchase of Bitcoin worth over $106 billion in just one year. This development unleashed a wave of institutional interest. Franklin Templeton’s Prediction for 2025 Franklin Templeton Digital Assets predicts that 2025 will mark a significant shift in the cryptocurrency industry. Instead of speculative trading, the focus is expected to move toward real-world applications, positioning digital assets as a vital part of global finance and operations. To prepare for this change, Franklin Templeton advises stakeholders to monitor three key areas: Regulatory Changes : Keeping up with evolving laws and compliance requirements. Institutional Moves : Watching how major players adapt and invest. AI-Crypto Integration : Understanding the synergy between blockchain and artificial intelligence. Why Trump’s Re-election Matters The re-election of Donald Trump as U.S. President is anticipated to accelerate cryptocurrency adoption. Franklin Templeton foresees Trump’s policies, coupled with the appointment of Paul Atkins as the new chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), bringing more regulatory clarity. This progress is likely to support the growth of innovative crypto products, including tokenized securities. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Top Crypto News of 2024: SBF’s Fall, Bitcoin’s Rise, and WazirX’s $235M Hack , One of the most promising areas in the crypto space is the Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN) .

38337370,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=635283,1735632979,"Eurozone growth threatened by global trade war, economists warn","The Eurozone is bracing for a strenuous 2025 as economists highlight mounting risks from a potential global trade war and regional political instability. A Financial Times poll of 72 economists identifies these factors as the most significant threats to the region’s economic health, with consensus forecasts projecting a mere 1.1% growth for the year. US President-elect Donald Trump’s promise to impose tariffs of up to 20% on US imports, with a potential escalation to 60% on Chinese goods, has raised fears of heightened protectionism. If enacted, these measures would represent the most significant increase in US tariffs since the Great Depression, likely triggering retaliatory actions from affected countries. The Eurozone, which maintains a significant trade surplus with the US, faces heightened exposure to these tariffs. Economists also warn of potential disruptions from China, which might flood global markets with cheap goods in response to Trump’s policies. Trade wars loom large: Should the Eurozone brace for impact? Nearly 69% of FT poll respondents anticipate a US-EU trade conflict, while 81% expect Trump’s return to weigh heavily on Eurozone growth. “Trump’s second presidency is now the single biggest political and economic risk,” said Mujtaba Rahman, managing director for Europe at Eurasia Group. FT Poll on 2025 Economic Trade Wars Possibility. Source: Financial Times Economists expect the Eurozone to expand by just 0.9% in 2025, marking a third consecutive year of below-average growth. This outlook aligns with a recent European Central Bank (ECB) survey of independent economists, which showcased several downside risks. The mere anticipation of tariffs will likely prompt businesses to delay investments as fear of the “unknown” creeps into business sectors. John Llewellyn, a former senior economist at the OECD, predicted an even gloomier scenario, suggesting the Eurozone economy could shrink by 1% over the year. “Economic stability is far more fragile than the modern generation recognizes,” he warned. Political ‘paralysis’ could create domestic challenges Across Europe, analysts are forecasting political fragmentation that could further complicate the economic landscape. Most of them believe Germany is unlikely to achieve a stable government until after snap elections in February, while France remains politically stagnant until President Emmanuel Macron’s term ends in 2027. Economist Ulrich Kater of Germany’s Deka Bank likened Europe’s struggles to those of the “late Habsburg empire,” citing bureaucratic inefficiencies and a lack of technological innovation. “Europe is bogged down by melancholic remembrance of its former greatness,” he added. ⚠️EUROZONE MANUFACTURING IS IN DISMAL PLACE⚠️ Manufacturing activity in the Euro-Area has been SHRINKING for 29 months straight. This is the longest streak since the 2011-2012 European Debt Crisis. Services also fell to contraction in November..👇 https://t.co/OlSrKmUzsH — Global Markets Investor (@GlobalMktObserv) December 27, 2024 European equities have underperformed against their US counterparts, with the Euro Stoxx 600 index trading at a record 40% discount to the S&P 500 based on next year’s forecast earnings. Despite near-record highs in European stock markets, global fund managers remain underweight on European equities, according to a Bank of America survey. While some analysts hold out hope for a German rebound after February’s elections, others aren’t convinced there’s hope. Marcel Fratzscher, president of DIW, cautioned against expecting a new German government to provide a significant boost to confidence. Trade negotiations to re-ignite optimism The majority of economists in FT’s poll, 61%, support ECB President Christine Lagarde’s call for EU policymakers to engage in trade talks with Trump to stave off an all-out trade war. However, opinions are divided on the best approach. “[The EU] may want to use the threat of retaliation as part of the negotiation. But ultimately, tariffs are a self-inflicted harm, and the EU would be better off not using them,” said Isabelle Mateos y Lago, chief economist at BNP Paribas. Others are less optimistic about a conciliatory approach. “Trump has the mentality of a playground bully,” remarked Kamil Kovar, senior economist at Moody’s, warning that concessions could encourage more aggressive policies from the US. Some economists see reasons for hope, backing their optimistic views with declining interest rates and a potential rise in consumer demand could offer modest relief. Additionally, reforms stemming from Germany’s elections could ease fiscal constraints, potentially lifting the country’s constitutional debt brake and spurring investment. “The psychological depression in Germany could be turned around if a new coalition presents a coherent reform program,” said Moritz Kraemer of LBBW. Nonetheless, significant challenges remain, with economists calling for coordinated efforts to address both external and internal risks to the Eurozone’s “fragile” recovery.

As is known, the cryptocurrency market grew incredibly under the leadership of Bitcoin in 2024, and the BTC price exceeded $ 100,000, leaving behind the psychological barrier that was once considered insurmountable. However, some altcoins broke records in terms of the number of daily active addresses on their blockchain networks in 2024. The list contains some surprising rankings in terms of size. It is particularly noteworthy that the Ethereum network did not make it into the top 10 on the list, and instead, many layer 2 protocols were on the list. Here are the blockchain networks with the highest number of daily active addresses and their average user numbers in 2024: Near (NEAR) – 2.7 million Solana (SOL) – 2.6 million Tron (TRX) – 1.9 million BNB Chain (BNB) – 1 million Polygon (POL) – 855 thousand Base – 655 thousand Sui (SUI) – 519 thousand Bitcoin (BTC) – 496 thousand The Open Network (TON) 414 thousand Arbitrum (ARB) – 413 thousand The reason why the layer 2 protocols on the list are so popular is that they are much faster and lower cost than the layer 1 protocol Ethereum.

Cardano and Dogwifhat are on the road to recovery, both these coins and ICO star DTX Exchange are must-haves for any growth portfolio in 2025. Table of Contents Cardano gains 8.5% in weekly charts Dogwifhat trying to revive the meme coin hype DTX Exchange: Investors gain 17% overnight Conclusion As Christmas week comes to an end, the markets are optimistic, and the Dogwifhat (WIF) and Cardano (ADA) charts turn green. Many other coins also saw green phases but could not sustain it for long. As the markets resume their positive movements and there is a bullish trend overall, experts predict there will be a more cautious approach to crypto investment. The predictions are also more muted, and upward projections are revised. Both Cardano and Dogwifhat have different things going for them. While Cardano is a technically strong and high utility, scalable network with PoS support, Dogwifhat is a popular meme coin that is supported by a robust community. While both these coins have positives, experts predict that the new hybrid trading platform DTX Exchange (DTX) is also poised for phenomenal growth in 2025. It is already listed on the aggregator platform CoinMarketCap. It is also gaining attention for its Phoenix Wallet, which offers non-custodial transaction support. Cardano gains 8.5% in weekly charts ADA has recovered 8.5% in the weekly charts and gained over 3.5% in the daily charts. Issues with the network and internal conflict have raised concerns about the financial management of investors’ funds and other governance issues. This had caused some negative movement. Source: CoinMarketCap The Cardano price touched $1.3 in early December before dropping to the $1.2 range. It eventually fell to the $0.77 low after the FOMC meeting and has recovered to its current range of $0.89. Market volume is up 24% to $855.67 million, while the market cap is currently $31.6 billion, up by almost 4%. Dogwifhat trying to revive the meme coin hype Dogwifhat is one of the cutest meme coins, with its Shiba Inu dog with a pink knitted hat symbol. The altcoin is built on the Solana blockchain and keeps a light-hearted approach that matches its fun-loving origins. Like most meme coins, the Dogwifhat price is usually volatile and reflects the market and external pricing influences effectively. With a strong community making the meme coin exciting, Dogwifhat (WIF) is a good choice for its big rewards and risks. Source: CoinMarketCap The WIF is trading around $1.89, up by over 2% in the daily charts. Community sentiment is bullish, while the market volume is up 3% to $248.88 million, and the market cap is currently $1.88 billion, up by almost 2%.

38336981,https://crypto.news/?p=14323490,1735632357,Crypto poses risks to India’s financial stability: RBI,"Cryptocurrencies, including stablecoins, pose significant risks to financial stability, according to the Reserve Bank of India. Reiterating its long-held anti-crypto stance , the RBI highlighted the various risks involved with digital assets in its Dec. 30 Financial Stability Report for 2024. While crypto adoption flourished at the grassroots level in India this year, the RBI raised a red flag, warning that unchecked use of digital assets, including stablecoins, could loosen monetary reins, open backdoors for capital flight, and “divert resources available for financing the real economy.” According to the regulator, while the crypto market in India “remains small,” the narrowing gap between decentralized and traditional finance could pose systemic risks, with stablecoins carrying the added danger of potential run risks . Citing the International Monetary Fund – Financial Stability Board report, the RBI added that stablecoin issuers are becoming significant holders of mainstream financial assets, such as government securities and other collateral, raising concerns about their impact on economic stability. Stablecoins also pose unique challenges, particularly in emerging markets where “country-specific macroeconomic and demographic factors” have led to increased usage, the report stated, adding: “These developments can undermine the effectiveness of monetary policy, circumvent capital controls, strain fiscal resources, and threaten financial stability.” You might also like: India risks losing $2b in tax revenue as crypto traders shift to offshore platforms: report Over the years, India’s central bank has pushed central bank digital currencies as a more reliable alternative to stablecoins. During the G30 39th Annual International Banking Seminar in October, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das labeled stablecoins as private money, which could undermine government sovereignty by allowing private issuers to dominate the payments market. Tokenization is another area that concerns the RBI due to the sector’s potential to “deepen the interconnectedness between the traditional financial system and the decentralized financial system.” Although the market for tokenization remains in its early stages, the RBI is worried about the risks it could introduce, including “liquidity and maturity mismatches,” excessive borrowing or debt built on tokenized assets, “asset price and quality risks,” and “operational fragilities.” The report stressed that these vulnerabilities could spill over into the broader financial system, amplifying systemic risks. The RBI’s warning comes as India’s cryptocurrency sector continues to drift in regulatory limbo. Despite calls for regularity clarity, the government recently admitted that there is “no fixed timeline” for introducing a comprehensive regulatory framework for virtual assets. Meanwhile, India’s crypto market remains burdened by a tax regime seen as overly harsh, with a 30% capital gains tax, a 1% TDS on every transaction, and no provision to offset losses. According to a recent report , this is triggering capital flight, yielding considerable revenue losses for both the government in the form of uncollected taxes and domestic crypto service providers due to declining trading activity as traders shift to offshore exchanges.

38336892,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=314618,1735632288,"$150,000 Bitcoin Incoming in 2025, According to Crypto Analyst Michaël van de Poppe – Here’s Why","Cryptocurrency analyst and trader Michaël van de Poppe is leaning bullish on Bitcoin ( BTC ). Van de Poppe tells his 169,000 YouTube subscribers that he expects Bitcoin to rally by approximately 60% over the course of 2025. According to the analyst, Bitcoin is primed to enjoy an extended bullish cycle over the coming months. “I do not expect Bitcoin to peak in 2025 because I expect that there’s way more money needed to actually move Bitcoin upwards or to move it into the markets. That’s why I think that the cycles are going to extend and they are more based on macro perspectives rather than the four-year cycle with halvings. So I think that within this year, we’re going to see Bitcoin breaking through $150,000 and stay there for a little while until we can start expanding into 2026.” According to Van de Poppe, Bitcoin’s rally will be partially driven by the macro-economic catalysts. “We can see that the global money supply starts to increase while the US money supply is just lagging behind. There’s still a lot to come from the US and I think that in 2025, the labor markets are going to be weaker, the chances of having a recession have increased and through that the US money supply will quickly expand through which Bitcoin [will] continue to have its momentum.” The crypto analyst and trader, however, says that Bitcoin will not have a smooth ride to the cycle peak. “That said I also expect to see significant corrections in between. I do assume that at the end of Q1 of 2025, we’re going to have a correction of 30%, very much comparable to what we’ve seen in 2024.” Bitcoin is trading at $93,790 at time of writing.

38336887,https://crypto.news/?p=14323460,1735632221,Lawmaker warns crypto miners in Chechnya will be treated like terrorists in 2025,"State Duma lawmaker Adam Delimkhanov says crypto miners in Chechnya will be equated with terrorists, following the ban on cryptocurrency mining in several regions in Russia starting in January 2025. According to Russian news outlet Tsargrad TV , Delimkhanov stated that starting from Jan. 1, 2025 cryptocurrency mining will be deemed illegal in the Chechen Republic. Therefore, anyone found mining crypto in the region will be punished severely. “We will equate them with terrorists, since their actions harm the whole society,” the deputy said, adding that he was relaying the words of Chechen Head of State Ramzan Kadyrov. Delimkhanov explained that crypto mining could lead to problems with the stability of electricity in certain region, affecting the daily lives of citizens. This is due to the large demand of electricity needed to power crypto mining systems, he said, which could disrupt the flow of electricity. He warned that if crypto mining activities are found to result in electricity problems in Russian districts, villages or cities, then the authorities will respond quickly and put crypto miners behind bars. You might also like: Russia to impose regional controls over crypto mining starting Jan 2025 As previously reported by crypto.news last October, Russian Deputy Energy Minister Evgeny Grabcha said that Bitcoin ( BTC ) mining will be banned in several key regions due to energy shortages. The ban applies to individual crypto miners and mining companies based in areas such as Dagestan, Chechnya, as well as the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics. It also extends to areas in the Irkutsk Region, Buryatia, and Zabaikalsky during peak hours. Lawmakers claim crypto mining has caused significant electricity deficits, making it impossible to provide large power capacities until at least 2030. The ban is said to take effect in November and will remain effective until March 15, 2031. The crypto mining ban follows Russian President Vladimir Putin’s signing of a crypto circulation bill that gives Russian lawmakers the power to ban cryptocurrency mining in specific regions. Not only that, the law also prohibits ads for companies that provide crypto services among other restrictions.

In contrast, Bonk has seen a 7% tumble in price following an extensive token burn, a move that highlights the inherent unpredictability often associated with meme coins. Both coins capture the imagination with their meteoric rises and falls, fueling short-term buzz but leaving questions about their longevity. Web3Bay sets itself apart with a strategy rooted in utility, aiming for more than just fleeting excitement. Its decentralized e-commerce platform is crafted to provide enduring value, appealing to both users and investors. The predicted ROI at the culmination of its presale stages is a towering 6000%, underscoring its potential for substantial financial gains. With practical applications and a commitment to sustainable growth, Web3Bay is emerging as a popular crypto currency poised for enduring success. Inside Web3Bay: Pioneering the Web3 Frontier Web3Bay is transforming the landscape of online shopping, blending blockchain technology with intuitive e-commerce solutions. This decentralized platform focuses on enhancing security, transparency, and user autonomy, integrating established payment methods like PayPal with innovative crypto transactions. By leveraging decentralized storage solutions such as IPFS and smart contracts, Web3Bay extends real utility beyond mere speculation. Currently advancing through 28 stages of its presale, the 3BAY token is capturing the attention of the market. From an initial price of $0.003, it is forecasted to surge to $0.1959 by the final stage, offering a 6430% ROI for early investors—a testament to its potential as one of the market’s popular crypto currencies. The Web3 shopping sector is expected to explode from $4.2 billion in 2022 to $55.32 billion by 2032, growing at an impressive CAGR of 45.8%. Web3Bay is strategically poised to claim a significant portion of this expanding market, providing a decentralized marketplace that brings tangible advantages to its users. With a focus on practical utility, community-led growth, and long-term prospects, Web3Bay is swiftly being recognized as a pivotal player in the Web3 shopping revolution. Frenzy in Meme Coins: Pepe Coin Market Cap Soars Pepe Coin remains a fixture in the news, its market cap having briefly eclipsed $11 billion, positioning it above established projects like Uniswap. This spike, fueled by prominent exchange listings including Robinhood and Coinbase, propelled PEPE to a staggering rally of more than 50% following the announcements. Despite its rollercoaster pricing, Pepe Coin is backed by a vibrant community, with over 77,000 wallets holding significant balances, evidencing a solid base of support. Yet, the frenetic pace of Pepe Coin’s ascent prompts scrutiny of its foundational strength. Market watchers point out its reliance on speculative trading, lacking a solid base in utility. While the recent surge in Pepe’s market cap highlights its potential for quick gains, the jury is still out on its capacity to sustain these values in a competitive environment. Bonk Price Fluctuates Post-Token Burn Bonk has recently navigated a major shift with its DAO initiating a burn of 1.69 trillion BONK tokens, an event worth over $51 million, aimed at refining its economic model and securing long-term stability. Nonetheless, the Bonk price fell by about 7% shortly after the burn, underscoring the volatile nature of meme coins. Still an active participant in the Solana ecosystem, Bonk benefits from minimal transaction costs and rapid processing speeds. Its community-driven actions, such as the recent token burn, demonstrate robust engagement, yet its dependence on speculative interest over substantial utility raises concerns about its future solidity. Key Insights Recently, the Pepe market cap surged to $11 billion due to newfound visibility on major exchanges and the typical meme coin excitement, while Bonk’s price experienced a dip following a substantial token burn designed to bolster its economics. These incidents reflect the speculative essence of meme coins, driven by immediate market enthusiasm but lacking in durable utility. In stark contrast, Web3Bay is carving out its niche as a standout, utility-driven asset within the rapidly growing Web3 shopping sector. With its decentralized e-commerce platform and a presale poised to deliver over 6000% ROI at its conclusion, Web3Bay stands out as a not-to-be-missed opportunity. Positioned among the market’s most popular crypto currencies , Web3Bay promises sustainable value and robust growth potential.

Some traders expect the current price action to likely continue until February, weeks after president-elect Donald Trump takes office in the U.S. and sets into motion a barrage of policies that may help the market.  ""We are skeptical of any New Year fireworks especially with funding healthy,"" traders at Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a Telegram broadcast. ""January's average returns (+3.3%) are relatively similar to December's (+4.8%), and we could expect spot to remain in this range in the near-term before things start to pick from Feb onwards.""  ""Options flows are also reflecting similar sentiments with frontend vols drifting lower and risk-reversals most bid for Calls in March, partly due to significant March (120k-130k) Calls bought last Friday,"" they added. This means traders are betting on bitcoin prices going up in March. They're buying more call options (which profit if the stock rises) than put options. The cost of these options is going down, showing optimism for the March period.    BTC is on track to end December down 4%, its worst since 2021, as both retail investors and long-term holders cash out positions after a 117% yearly surge. Elsewhere, readings of the U.S. Chicago PMI indicate an economic slowdown, adding pressure on the market that tends to be correlated to such data.    In what looks to have been its final purchase of the year, Bitcoin development company MicroStrategy increased its BTC stash for the eighth consecutive week on Monday, adding another 2,138 BTC for $209 million in the week ended Dec. 29. That brought its total holdings to 446,400 BTC.    But news of the buying did little to stem losses. BTC prices slumped in the hours following MicroStrategy’s announcement, while shares of the company fell 8% to their lowest since early November.    The fall spread over to majors, with ether (ETH), XRP, Solana’s SOL and Cardano’s ADA falling as much as 3% before recovering. BNB Chain’s BNB was little changed, while memecoins dogecoin (DOGE) and shiba inu (SHIB) fell 5%.    The broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20), an index tracking the largest tokens by market capitalization, minus stablecoins, lost 2.7% in the past 24 hours.    Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) holding the asset recorded $420 million in outflows in their second-last day of trading ahead of the new year, data shows. Fidelity’s FBTC lost $154 million to lead outflows, followed by Grayscale’s GBTC at $130 million and BlackRock’s IBIT at $36 million.    The products have recorded more than $1.5 billion in net outflows since Dec. 19, pausing an impressive run in the first half of the month that saw nearly $2 billion in net inflows.

Data released on Dec. 30 revealed that December marked the highest monthly trading volume for DEXs, continuing the momentum from November. In November, the DeFi space recorded a volume of $374 billion, spurred by optimism surrounding a potential crypto-friendly regulatory regime in the United States after Donald Trump’s presidential election victory. Top DEXs by Trading Volume Uniswap remained the top decentralized exchange by volume, recording $106.4 billion over the past 30 days, according to DefiLlama. PancakeSwap followed with $96.4 billion in trading volume for the month. Solana’s largest DEX, Raydium, claimed third place, registering $58 billion in monthly volume. This surge coincided with an increase in Solana-based decentralized application (DApp) revenue. On Dec. 17, research platform Syndica reported that Solana DApps generated $365 million in revenue during November, largely fueled by memecoins launched on the Solana platform Pump.fun. Aerodrome and Orca took the fourth and fifth spots, with volumes of $31 billion and $22 billion, respectively. Lifinity, Curve Finance, and Hyperliquid collectively recorded $43.6 billion in trading volume. Memecoin Market Declines Despite Early Surge While DeFi trading volumes climbed, the memecoin market faced a significant correction in December. CoinMarketCap data showed that the memecoin market cap peaked at $137 billion on Dec. 9 but dropped sharply to $92 billion by Dec. 23. At the time of writing, the total market cap for memecoins stood at $95 billion, reflecting a 20% decline since Dec. 1.

38336520,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=635258,1735631190,"Most investors, analysts and industry execs see Bitcoin’s price doubling to $200k in 2025","After breaking past $100,000 in December — something the crypto market had been drooling over for years — Bitcoin hitting $200,000 no longer feels like some pipe dream. Everyone’s predicting it: investors, researchers, analysts, CEOs. Donald Trump’s return to the White House in November set the stage for what many are calling Bitcoin’s most explosive growth era yet. Why? Simple: Trump loves crypto. During his campaign, he promised to fire SEC Chair Gary Gensler, the guy the crypto community sees as their biggest enemy, and create a national Bitcoin strategic reserve funded by selling off the Federal Reserve’s gold for it. A new narrative for Bitcoin The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in 2024 was a game-changer. Forget the drama of 2023—the FTX collapse, Binance scandals, and Sam Bankman-Fried in prison—because ETFs brought legitimacy. With Bitcoin ETFs on the table, institutional investors who’ve been sitting on the sidelines had a clean, regulated way to get in on the action. This isn’t just about Wall Street suits buying Bitcoin. It’s about your 401(k) eventually having a slice of it, thanks to those ETFs. So what’s the word on 2025? James Butterfill at CoinShares thinks Bitcoin could swing between $80,000 and $150,000 depending on Trump’s follow-through. “It’s all about the regulatory environment,” he said. If Trump delivers, the upper end of that range looks solid. If not? We’re looking at a dip to $80k. Institutional flows and the $200k prophecy Institutional money is flowing into Bitcoin like never before. Standard Chartered estimates that institutional inflows have already reached 683,000 BTC this year, much of it driven by ETFs and purchases from companies like MicroStrategy . The firm predicts Bitcoin will double to $200,000 by 2025, thanks to reforms that could allow U.S. retirement funds to allocate small portions of their $40 trillion pool to crypto. Pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, and corporate balance sheets are all looking at Bitcoin . And the incoming Trump administration might make that easier by tweaking rules to let traditional finance (or “TradFi,” as the cool kids say) allocate more to crypto. Kendrick even pointed out that a tiny slice of the $40 trillion U.S. retirement fund market could push Bitcoin through the roof. Matrixport is playing it a little safer but still bullish, with a $160,000 target. Markus Thielen says Bitcoin’s base of buyers has expanded to the point where it can handle corrections without tanking. “Corrections will still happen, but not like the old days,” he said. Matrixport nailed its 2024 call of $125,000, so folks are now paying some serious attention to their 2025 prediction. Then there’s Galaxy Digital, which expects Bitcoin to hit $185,000 in Q4 2025. They’re betting on adoption from nations and corporations alike. Five Nasdaq 100 companies and at least five countries are expected to add Bitcoin to their reserves next year, according to their research. “Bitcoin is outpacing gold and stocks,” said Alex Thorn, their head of research. Big players, big bets Carol Alexander, a finance professor who called Bitcoin’s $100,000 surge early on this year, sees the price hitting $200,000, possibly even by summer. But she’s not blind to the risks. Alexander points out that unregulated crypto exchanges can drive insane volatility, thanks to leveraged trades. “It could hit $150,000 and swing $50,000 either way,” she said. Still, her track record makes her voice one to watch. Youwei Yang at Bit Mining also has high hopes, with a range of $180,000 to $190,000. But he’s quick to add that Bitcoin could dip as low as $80,000 during market shocks, like a major stock market crash or geopolitical tensions. “Overall, though, the trend is bullish,” he said. Sid Powell at Maple Finance shares the optimism with a dose of caution. He’s targeting $180,000 to $200,000 by year-end 2025, based on ETF inflows and Trump’s rumored Bitcoin reserve. But Powell knows the game—crypto loves its cycles. “Corrections are part of the process,” he said, but added that institutional flows should act as a safety net, preventing the 70%-80% drawdowns of the past. At press time, Bitcoin was worth $92,557.

38336251,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53510,1735630497,"Analyst Spots XRP Bullish Symmetrical Triangle, Says Breakout to $4 Will Come Out of Nowhere","Renowned crypto investor Armando Pantoja recently shared an analysis of XRP’s price chart on social media. His post highlighted the formation of a symmetrical triangle pattern, commonly associated with bullish momentum in technical analysis. Pantoja stated, “Some $XRP holders are crying about consolidation, when it’s obviously forming a symmetrical triangle (bullish). Breakout to $3.20-$4 will come out of nowhere.” The symmetrical triangle is a chart pattern characterized by converging trendlines, indicating a period of price consolidation. It typically resolves with a breakout in the direction of the prevailing trend—in this case, upward momentum, as suggested by XRP’s prior rally. Based on Pantoja’s analysis, XRP’s current price action supports the possibility of a breakout , with a price target between $3.20 and $4. Some $XRP holders are crying about consolidation, when it's obviously forming a symmetrical triangle (bullish). Breakout to $3.20-$4 will come out of nowhere. #XRP pic.twitter.com/wAdPznO1aL — Armando Pantoja (@_TallGuyTycoon) December 29, 2024 Community Sentiments and Reactions The post received significant engagement from the cryptocurrency community, sparking discussions about XRP’s price trajectory. Some users expressed optimism about the pattern, while others voiced skepticism based on past price performance. One commenter, Val, pointed out the recurring formation of symmetrical triangles in XRP’s history, which have not always resulted in the anticipated upward breakout. Val wrote, “Okay and how many times has it formed a symmetrical triangle in the past only for people to say it’s bullish & an indication that the price is going to rise, only for it not to have ended up pumping? Too many times. The price of XRP as of right now should be $5, but it’s not.” This sentiment reflects the frustrations of long-term XRP holders who have yet to see sustained price increases align with their expectations. Another user, RippleMeThis, took a different stance, commenting , “Crying with a $2 floor lol. They never would have lasted when it was $0.30.” This viewpoint highlights the substantial growth XRP has already achieved, emphasizing resilience amid market volatility. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Indika Torres contributed an optimistic perspective, stating , “Absolutely! Probably this week. Don’t understand the crying. We have buying opportunities right now. The people that are in fear, they lack knowledge. 2025 will be massive for ISO tokens.” ISO tokens mentioned by Torres refer to cryptocurrencies compliant with ISO 20022, a financial messaging standard gaining traction among global financial institutions. Current Market Context At the time of press, XRP is trading at $2.09, representing a 2.55% decline in the past 24 hours. Despite this slight dip, the broader market sentiment remains cautiously optimistic, with investors eyeing a potential breakout from the symmetrical triangle pattern. Outlook While technical analysis suggests a bullish scenario, investors are advised to exercise caution. Market conditions, macroeconomic factors, and regulatory developments can significantly impact XRP’s price movements. As the cryptocurrency approaches the apex of the triangle, traders will closely monitor trading volume and price action for confirmation of a breakout. If Pantoja’s projection materializes, XRP holders could witness substantial gains, potentially solidifying the asset’s position as a leading cryptocurrency.

38336250,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53482,1735630245,Crypto That Beat Out Even XRP This Bull Run: Cutting Edge Hyperliquid And New Crypto Rollblock,"Q4 has been extremely bullish for the altcoin space, and XRP has taken most of the media attention thanks to its near 400% increase. However, there are two new crypto assets that have outpaced the XRP price rise. Hyperliquid launched in November and was up 8X before a slight correction. The bull run has extended to those in presale too, with Rollblock , a next-gen GambleFi platform whose price is up over 400%, and of course, with its launch to come, 2025 might just turn out to be an incredible year for its investors. New Crypto Rollblock Presale is Taking the Market by Storm Rollblock is no doubt one of the hottest new crypto projects, with its presale surprising many during the Q4 bull run . The presale, now in stage 9, has already raised over $7.7 million, and seen a token price surge well over 400%. What is it about Rollblock that’s rocking the market at such an early stage? Well, it boasts strong utility and an ambitious vision of bringing DeFi innovation to the lucrative $500 billion online gambling industry. One of its key DeFi features is the Rollblock Revenue Sharing Model. This ensures all token holders earn a percentage of the platform’s revenues, and it’s paid out automatically to their wallets. It’s a great way to earn a passive income, and for those interested in that, there’s an even more lucrative staking mechanism built into Rollblock. To take advantage of this, token holders need to stake their tokens, which means locking them up for a certain period. This will help the platform with security and liquidity, and for their troubles, investors will be rewarded with up to 30% APY. There are many other standout features to this exciting new crypto asset, and analysts are predicting continued success for Rollblock. The bull run is expected to get crazy in 2025, and after it launches, even the most bullish Rollblock analysts’ predictions might seem a bit conservative. XRP Up Almost 400% in Q4 Bull Run XRP has been one of the standout performers in the recent bull run , with the price up nearly 400%. The token has benefited from the Trump factor after hints of it being included in the new government’s policy. The most likely utility for XRP would be cross-border payments, and there’s talk of a new USD stablecoin, which the Trump administration is known to want, being built into the XRP network. Hyperliquid Skyrockets 8X as Bull Run Gains Momentum Hyperliquid has been one of the biggest benefactors of the Q4 bull run, with the HYPE price skyrocketing 8x in value in a few short weeks. Not even a month old, Hyperliquid is a cutting-edge Layer 1 blockchain that’s looking to revolutionize DeFi thanks to its decentralized perpetual exchange services. Analysts are bullish on HYPE , and momentum suggests further gains ahead as the bull run garners pace again. Conclusion The Q4 bull run has been exciting to be part of. Even “Dinocoins” such as XRP have caught a bid. As the bull continues into 2025, we should see even more gains, and new crypto assets such as Hyperliquid and Rollblock might just take center stage. After all, it’s the newest cryptos that bring in the biggest gains of any bull run. Discover the exciting opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) presale today!

Here’s Why Web3Bay Rises Above the Hype from AI Memecoins Zerebro and ai16z,"Which crypto to buy in today’s unpredictable market? As blockchain and AI trends collide, Zerebro Token and ai16z are grabbing attention. Zerebro, with its decentralized AI content system, is capitalizing on innovative use cases across blockchain ecosystems, while ai16z price movements reflect strong activity in the AI meme coin space, driven by its unique venture-focused DAO framework. But while these projects ride short-term hype cycles, Web3Bay is carving a path for utility-focused growth. As a decentralized e-commerce platform, it integrates blockchain technology to offer real-world solutions, bridging Web2 and Web3. With a long-term vision and growing presale success, Web3Bay stands out as a solid contender for those looking beyond fleeting trends. Its potential is hard to ignore. Web3Bay: A Game-Changer for Decentralized Shopping Web3Bay is reshaping e-commerce by merging blockchain technology with practical utility. Unlike many crypto projects chasing trends, it focuses on creating a decentralized online shopping platform. This allows users to transact securely and transparently, with reduced fees and enhanced privacy. Its dual payment system, accepting both cryptocurrencies and methods like PayPal, bridges the gap between traditional shoppers and crypto enthusiasts. As the global online shopping market is set to exceed $7 trillion by 2025, Web3Bay taps into a massive growth opportunity. The platform’s presale offers an exciting entry point for those evaluating which crypto to buy today. Spanning 28 stages, the 3BAY token began at $0.003 and is set to reach $0.1959 by the final phase. Each stage features a 15% price increase, offering early adopters a potential return on investment (ROI) exceeding 6430% if the token hits its target price. This structured growth model demonstrates a well-planned approach to building value over time. With features like an NFT marketplace, staking opportunities, and Layer-2 scalability for seamless transactions, Web3Bay’s long-term potential is significant. It positions itself as a leader in the Web3 e-commerce market, projected to surpass $5 billion by 2030. By addressing real-world needs with blockchain innovation, Web3Bay offers more than hype—it’s building a future-ready ecosystem. ai16z Price Trends and Network Growth ai16z is gaining traction as an AI-driven cryptocurrency, leveraging decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) technology to redefine venture capital. Its ElizaOS protocol supports autonomous AI agents, enabling data-driven decisions within the network. Recent market performance shows a surge in activity, with the ai16z price climbing to $1.25 and a market cap of $1.29 billion. The token has recorded impressive 7-day growth of over 88%, reflecting strong momentum. Supporting this growth, ai16z has been integrated into Ethereum validators through strategic partnerships, enhancing network scalability and reliability. The introduction of USDT-margined perpetual futures on OKX offers traders up to 50x leverage, boosting market engagement. As the AI meme coin space continues to expand, the ai16z price remains a key metric to watch, highlighting its position as an emerging force in the AI and blockchain crossover. Zerebro Token: Driving Innovation in Decentralized AI Zerebro is at the forefront of decentralized AI, using its autonomous system to create, analyze, and distribute content across platforms. Built on Solana and leveraging Polygon for digital assets, the Zerebro token powers this innovative network. Currently priced at $0.3055, it boasts a market cap of $299 million, with a recent 7-day growth of over 43%. This performance highlights increasing interest in Zerebro’s potential within the blockchain ecosystem. The project’s integration with io.net’s decentralized GPU network enhances its Ethereum validator operations, ensuring scalability and reliability. The introduction of perpetual futures with up to 50x leverage on OKX has further expanded trading opportunities for the Zerebro token. As it pushes the boundaries of decentralized AI, Zerebro positions itself as a unique player in the crypto market, blending cutting-edge technology with strategic partnerships. Summing Up Zerebro and ai16z are making strides in the crypto market, with the Zerebro token priced at $0.3055 and the ai16z price reaching $1.25. Both projects highlight the growing potential of AI-powered and decentralized networks, offering intriguing opportunities for short-term engagement. However, for those looking at which crypto to buy today with long-term growth in mind, Web3Bay stands out. Starting its presale at $0.003 and targeting $0.1959, it offers an ROI potential of over 6430%.

Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, calls it “the greatest launch in ETF history.” Per a recent Bloomberg report , the Bitcoin ETF, launched on January 11, 2024 , is the most successful ETF ever. BlackRock’s IBIT has amassed over $50 billion in assets under management (AuM) in the past 11 months, the report added. This is the first time an ETF is making a massive debut. According to Todd Sohn, managing director of ETF and at Strategas Securities, IBIT’s AuM was equivalent to over 50 European market-focused ETFs combined. Some of those European ETFs were more than 20 years old. “IBIT’s growth is unprecedented,” noted Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart. “It’s the fastest ETF to reach most milestones, faster than any other ETF in any asset class.” Seyffart forecasted that IBIT could earn about $112 million a year, given an expense ratio of 0.25% and with the current asset level. This comes a day after the US Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a remarkable $35.66 billion net inflows in 2024. BlackRock’s IBIT led the market with $37.31 billion in inflows. Further, BlackRock’s $11 trillion in assets under management has helped drive Bitcoin’s price past $100,000 for the first time. BlackRock’s IBIT Could Outshine Gold Shares While BlackRock’s IBIT leading the charge, Gold ETFs, with a current market size of $274 billion, are experiencing significant outflows for the first time in six months. Additionally, there is speculation that IBIT could outperform the largest gold ETF – SPDR Gold Shares, provided Bitcoin price remains strong. Nate Geraci recently shared a chart that makes a notable comparison between spot gold ETFs and bitcoin ETFs in the US. For reference, Gold ETFs were launched in 2004, while Bitcoin ETFs were launched in 2024. One of the more ridiculous charts you’ll ever see… Assets in spot gold ETFs vs bitcoin ETFs.

Here’s a roundup of the biggest crypto news that made headlines throughout the year. Bitcoin ETF Approvals: A Milestone for the Industry The year kicked off with a historic move for Bitcoin as the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the first US-listed Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). This approval marked a pivotal moment for the world’s largest cryptocurrency, opening the doors to a broader range of investors who were previously hesitant to buy Bitcoin directly. In total, 11 Bitcoin ETFs were approved in the US, offering a simpler entry point into the crypto market for traditional investors. SBF Sentenced: The Fall of FTX’s Founder In March, the crypto world was rocked by the sentencing of Samuel Bankman-Fried (SBF), the disgraced founder of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX. Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison , three years of supervised release, and was ordered to pay $11 billion in forfeiture for his involvement in fraudulent schemes. The sentencing followed his conviction for misappropriating billions of dollars of customer funds. Despite his conviction, Bankman-Fried has appealed his 25-year sentence, leaving the legal saga far from over. MicroStrategy’s Big Move: Nasdaq 100 Debut Amidst the turbulence, MicroStrategy, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, made waves in the market by debuting on the Nasdaq 100 in 2024 . This move solidified MicroStrategy’s profile as a major player in the world of Bitcoin, further blurring the lines between traditional finance and the crypto ecosystem. Bitcoin Halving: Reduced Block Rewards In April, Bitcoin’s third halving event of the year occurred, reducing miners’ block subsidy rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. This event had a significant impact on the network’s economic dynamics, although the drop in mining rewards was accompanied by a surprising decrease in average transaction fees. This halving event laid the foundation for a strong remainder of the year, with many anticipating a new price surge. Ripple vs. SEC: Legal Battle Continues One of the year’s most high-profile legal battles continued in 2024 with Ripple’s ongoing conflict with the SEC. In August, Ripple secured a major victory when the court ruled that it should only pay $125 million in fines , a far cry from the $2 billion originally sought by the SEC. However, the battle didn’t end there: in October, the SEC announced its intention to appeal the ruling, ensuring that the legal showdown between the two entities would continue into the next year.

Homosexual Pepe (HOMOPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HOMOPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Homosexual Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homosexual Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Homosexual Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homosexual Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homosexual Pepe by entering its contract address – 92xPeBxtanptFH9AYsRtwRMq7cWWw9GHfxaspwpNvCTP – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMOPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/homosexual-pepe-homopepe-solana-memecoin-to-surge-18000-ahead-of-first-exchange-listing-while-shib-bonk-and-doge-crash/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

While the percentage of long-term Bitcoin holders has declined, Ethereum has seen a steady increase, surpassing Bitcoin’s share earlier this year. This chart shows the percentage of long-term Bitcoin and Ether holders over the past year. While the share of long-term Bitcoin decreased, the percentage of long-term ETH holders climbed, surpassing that of Bitcoin early in the year. pic.twitter.com/F7ghaSq66T — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) December 29, 2024 This trend has fueled speculation about an upcoming altseason, as Ethereum continues to outperform Bitcoin in several key areas. Ethereum Gains Ground Against Bitcoin Ethereum’s recent surge against Bitcoin in the ETH/BTC pair suggests a potential breakout, a historical precursor to altseason—a period where altcoins typically outperform Bitcoin. The Altcoin Season Index hit a high of 88/100 earlier this month (December 4) but has since settled at 47, indicating mixed sentiment regarding altcoin performance. Market dynamics further support this narrative. ETH gains against BTC often trigger broader altcoin rallies, reflecting growing investor interest in alternative cryptocurrencies. This shift in focus could pave the way for increased market activity in altcoins as 2025 approaches. Ethereum Outperforms Bitcoin: Altseason on the Horizon?

According to data by SoSoValue, the 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $426.13 million in outflows on Dec. 30 extending their outflow streak to two consecutive days that saw $723.8 million leave the funds. Fidelity’s FBTC saw the highest outflows of the day with $154.64 million withdrawn from the fund while Grayscale’s GBTC followed with an outflow of $134.5 million. Additional outflows were seen from BlackRock’s IBIT, Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust, Bitwise’s BITB and ARK 21Shares’s ARKB saw $36.52 million, $31.73 million, $31.37 million and $26.4 million leave the funds respectively. Valkyrie’s BRRR also saw a modest outflow of $10.96 million on the day. Reportedly none of the BTC ETFs saw any inflows on the day. The total daily trading volume for the 12 investment products stood at $3.14 billion on Dec. 30 slightly higher than the $3.02 billion seen the previous day. Meanwhile, the significant outflows seen on Monday came as Bitcoin ( BTC ) failed to maintain at $95,000 a key support level as identified by analysts. This breakdown increased the risk of the price tumbling further, potentially dropping as low as $60,000.

They believe the US crypto space will particularly lead crypto innovation next year with favorable ETF regulations. The company remarked, “ 2025 will mark a shift from speculation to utility, as crypto’s foundational technologies become integral to global financial and operational systems.” Franklin Templeton expects friendlier crypto regulations Franklin Templeton anticipates that the U.S. will lead in crypto innovation by implementing more accommodating regulations for ETFs and tokenized assets in 2025. They believe favorable regulations will drive the industry’s growth, expecting traditional finance players and the crypto infrastructure to converge. The firm also projects for the establishment of a stablecoin regulatory framework in the US which they believe will allow for many other financial institutions to launch their own stablecoins. Moreover, Templeton believes tokenized products and stablecoin adoption will continue to expand and be major drivers of decentralized finance (DeFi) growth globally. They also expect to see many countries starting their own Bitcoin reserves, and for BTC to grow into a global financial asset driven by increased institutional adoption. Franklin Templeton says AI and crypto interactions will increase Franklin Templeton added that they expected decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) to see growing demand due to their application in practical areas such as logistics and the Internet of Things (IoT). They also predict that artificial intelligence and crypto will merge faster, utilizing blockchain technology for transparency and verification. The investment company also said that AI agents would likely employ blockchain infrastructure to streamline on-chain transactions, manage portfolios, and connect digital content and social media with blockchain ecosystems. They added that stakeholders needed to monitor regulatory changes, and institutional strategies, and advance AI-crypto integration to remain competitive in this dynamic field. However, they recognized that digital assets are still tied to underdeveloped technologies, potential security vulnerabilities, intellectual property disputes, exchange credit risks, regulatory uncertainty, value instability, limited global adoption, and susceptibility to manipulation and fraud.

Let’s take a closer look at BTFD Coin, Non-Playable Coin, and Andy, and see which one stands out as the best new meme coin to invest in today. Meme coins have become more than just a passing trend. They’ve evolved into a legitimate asset class, with even big-time investors noticing. Over the years, meme coins have attracted investors with their meme-powered communities, solid use cases, and sky-high potential returns. BTFD Coin is poised to take this excitement to the next level, offering more than just hype. With its innovative Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, referral program, staking rewards, and rock-solid community, BTFD Coin is positioning itself to become one of the best new meme coins to invest in today. BTFD Coin (BTFD): The Underdog Meme Coin Making Waves BTFD Coin is on a fast track to becoming one of the best new meme coins to invest in today. Launched just recently, BTFD Coin’s presale has been phenomenal, raising over $4.6 million within the first month of its launch. The presale has surpassed 60 billion coins sold and attracted over 7000 holders, all keen to ride the BTFD wave to potential riches. At the core of BTFD Coin’s appeal is its strong community and exciting ecosystem. The coin is more than just another meme token; it’s got legs. Its Play-to-Earn game is set to create a whole new level of engagement and utility for holders, giving them a chance to earn rewards just by playing. And with a referral program that offers bonuses for bringing new users into the fold, BTFD Coin is leaning hard into its community-driven model. It’s a coin built on the notion that the more people get involved, the more everyone gains. This approach gives BTFD Coin a serious leg up over many other meme coins on the market. The presale is now in its 13th phase , with the token priced at $0.000142 . So far, it has raised $4.6 million , surpassing milestones of $1 million in the first 10 days and $2.5 million within 14 days . The project proudly counts over 7,000 holders , with 60 billion coins sold already. Non-Playable Coin (NPC): A Quirky Twist on the Meme Coin Scene If you’re looking for something a little different in the meme coin market, Non-Playable Coin (NPC) might be what you’re after. This coin stands out by embracing the idea of “non-playable” as a theme, incorporating the concept of “non-playable characters” (NPCs) from the gaming world. NPC’s approach is all about leaning into the idea of gaming and digital worlds in a tongue-in-cheek, meme-driven way. It’s the type of coin that might make you scratch your head and laugh at the absurdity of it all—exactly the kind of humour that meme coins thrive on. But don’t let the quirky concept fool you. NPC is rapidly gaining traction among those who love the idea of meme coins with a gaming twist. The coin’s presale has seen some decent momentum, and analysts predict that NPC could see some serious growth as the gaming and meme coin sectors continue to collide. However, it’s still in its early stages, and much of the hype is based on the meme coin market’s overall growth rather than its immediate utility. The big question for NPC investors is whether its community will be strong enough to carry it to the moon or remain a niche meme coin for diehard fans. While it has some unique appeal, it still lacks the expansive ecosystem and utility BTFD Coin offers with its P2E game and rewards programs. So, if you’re eyeing the best new meme coins to invest in today, it’s worth keeping an eye on NPC, but it’s hard to compete with the excitement BTFD Coin is generating. Andy (ANDY): Meme Coin with a Dash of Personality Let’s talk about Andy, a meme coin bringing personality and attitude to the meme coin world. This coin’s charm lies in its distinctive character-driven branding, which taps into the meme-driven culture that has made cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu household names. The idea behind Andy is simple: to create a coin that resonates with people through humour, pop culture references, and a playful attitude towards crypto. While Andy is still in its early stages, it’s worth noting that it’s taking a more traditional meme coin approach. The project’s roadmap doesn’t offer as much utility as BTFD Coin’s gaming platform or staking rewards, but its community is strong, and that’s a huge factor in the meme coin market. With its fun vibe and easy-to-understand concept, Andy has much potential, especially as it develops further. One clear thing is that Andy’s meme-driven approach has already built a strong fanbase. Its tokenomics and growth potential will depend heavily on the success of its community and whether it can keep pace with the more innovative meme coins like BTFD Coin. It’s a fun coin to hold, but will it deliver long-term value for its investors? Only time will tell.

The linear regression indicator shows that XRP might hit $27 by the end of the cycle. XRP retained $2 in the past 24 hours and surged as high as $2.14. Predicting XRP’s price is important for traders, with price action serving as a key indicator to chart the token’s future trajectory. The fourth-largest digital asset by market capitalization dropped nearly 11% in the past 24 hours but held firm above $2 after recently reaching $2.14. Analysts rely on tools like linear regression models to predict future price movements, as price action often dictates market sentiment, leading narratives in the crypto space. While XRP hit a multi-year high of $2.86, it still trades 47.54% below its all-time high of $3.84, with fresh forecasts pointing to a sharp rally ahead. And so, in this case, analyst “EGRAG CRYPTO,” in a post on X (formerly Twitter), made use of linear regression to analyze XRP’s price movement.

Bitcoin’s troubles continued, as prices plunged from above $99.2K on Boxing Day to $92.52K at press time. Altcoins endured similar trends. Shiba Inu’s plummeted burn rate signals potential struggles as XRP bears threaten the $2 barrier. Meanwhile, attention has switched to the presale project iDEGEN ahead of its January official listing. Source – iDEGEN iDEGEN is an AI-based cryptocurrency project that has grabbed investor attention in the past few weeks with its uniqueness. It uses artificial intelligence to absorb and learn everything from the crypto community on X, formerly Twitter. iDEGEN has sold over 1.44 billion tokens, raising $11.12 million in its fast-paced ICO. Let’s check SHIB, XRP, and IDEGEN’s prevailing price actions and what to expect in the coming year. SHIB future uncertain amid 90% burn rate slump The second-largest meme token trades at $0.00002059 after losing 3.50% and 8.67% in the past day and week. Shiba Inu displays significant bearishness, suggesting more declines before possible bounce-backs. For instance, its burn rate has seen wild fluctuations recently, down 90.70% over the past day. Crypto-00711 @00711Crypto · Follow #ShibaInu ’s burn rate has dropped recently, and it’s got people wondering about its price recovery, especially with the market being all over the place.The burn rate is important for tokens like Shiba Inu because it shows how fast tokens are being taken out of circulation.… 7:27 AM · Dec 31, 2024 0 Reply Copy link Read more on Twitter Token burns are deflationary mechanisms that crypto projects use to magnify scarcity by reducing supply. However, these events have had limited effects on Shiba Inu’s price. As 2024 ends, questions arise about whether the token scorch initiatives can yield long-term success or if overall market sentiments will continue to overshadow burn efforts. Furthermore, on-chain stats show whale movements stimulate SHIB’s price actions. Whale transactions can be a double-edged sword when combined with burn rates, amplifying speculative price actions and aggravating corrections. Such dynamics remain vital for shaping Shiba Inu’s near-term outlook heading into the new year. XRP sways above $2 amid bear dominance Yesterday’s dramatic surge in trading volume could not move XRP as the altcoin struggled around the $2 psychological level. XRP gained over 230% to $2.86 record peaks following Trump’s election win. Meanwhile, the alt has consolidated since early December, failing to recover despite bullish developments like the RLUSD launch. XRP trades at 2.02 with a 2.50% 24-hour loss. The altcoin’s upcoming trajectory will depend on various factors. Chart by Coinmarketcap Renewed trading activities in the coming sessions will potentially keep XRP afloat until Trump’s inauguration. After that, investors will focus on regulations, with Ripple’s IPO, RLUD adoption, and XRP ETFs as catalysts for robust performance in 2025. iDEGEN: The Trending AI token While altcoins such as Shiba Inu and XRP display uncertainty, iDEGEN emerges to disrupt the cryptocurrency industry. The project’s unique approach grabs attention as AI and the blockchain sector merge. Its website highlights that: Every time someone tweets at iDEGEN, its AI absorbs the data, using it to learn, adapt, and then tweet every hour. This model will likely attract massive engagements, which would be crucial for the asset’s long-term success. iDEGEN trades at $0.0314 after gaining 70% in the past seven days. Its market timing as a leader of the AI and blockchain revolutions positions IDEGEN for robust growth in 2025 and beyond.

38335300,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=376775,1735628748,Tough Week for Ripple’s XRP: 24H Volume Decline Is Dire as Price Slumps,"A couple of hourly red candles emerged in the middle of the trading day Monday, and they began to pull Ethereum, Dogecoin, and Avalanche into the red for the weekly period ending Monday. But no top ten losses were as steep as those for XRP as afternoon turned to evening on the US East Coast Monday. By the time stock markets in New York closed, Ripple tokens were down over 7% for the 7D span on crypto exchanges that run 24 hours a day. XRP Daily Volume Drops 93% in Dec One decisive factor in XRP’s declining price Monday was a massive downturn in trading volume on popular cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance, Kraken, and KuCoin. XRP daily trade volume on these platforms fell to $2.5 billion Sunday evening from $37.5 billion to start off December just less than a month ago. Keep in mind that XRP was the outstanding gainer among its peers in November and December after Donald Trump’s successful reelection to the White House on Nov. 5. XRP’s price over-indexed so far above its peers during this period that it carried the cross-border settlement tokens for the year. From Jan. 1 to Dec. 25, XRP returned a yearly green candle of 247% to Bitcoin’s 126%, Solana’s 75%, and Ethereum’s 49%. So, altcoin traders might have expected Ripple’s price and volume to decline based on mean reversion to the average trend for these digital assets. Other crypto assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum fell in trading volume, but not nearly as much as Ripple this month. Bullish Sign for XRP’s Price Soon? This is interesting because Ripple’s price notched a 10% gain in December without volume support. That means when volume comes back, it could really launch. Meanwhile, the 7-day price decline creates a window of opportunity for altcoin traders to make an entry at a value over earlier December prices for Ripple.

Here’s why,"Edo Farina, the CEO of Alpha Lion Academy, has once again ignited discussions within the cryptocurrency community with a tweet featuring a compelling image that suggests major global financial institutions will soon have a vested interest in acquiring XRP. His tweet, accompanied by the comment “Don’t give your $XRP away for free,” has sparked diverse reactions, ranging from support to critical skepticism. The image Farina shared illustrates prominent financial firms, including BlackRock, Vanguard, Fidelity, UBS, and JPMorgan Chase, alongside their respective assets under management (AUM). Don’t give your $XRP away for free. pic.twitter.com/ZDADvdhMuT — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) December 28, 2024 The graphic implies that these firms managing trillions of dollars collectively may soon seek to integrate XRP into their operations, potentially leveraging it for financial settlements or other applications. The claim, while ambitious, has generated significant attention. XRP enthusiasts see this as validation of the digital asset’s potential to play a critical role in the financial sector. However, critics have questioned the premise, asking for clear evidence and defined use cases. Community Reactions: Diverging Opinions The responses to Farina’s tweet highlight a clear divide within the cryptocurrency and financial communities. Some critics questioned the practicality of XRP’s use case, particularly about its adoption by major institutions. One pointed out that existing systems like SWIFT and emerging solutions such as Chainlink’s CCIP might already address interoperability needs, suggesting a lack of public evidence for XRP’s role in such frameworks. On the other hand, supporters of XRP emphasized its advantages in offering faster and cheaper transactions compared to traditional systems. They argued that institutions unwilling to adopt modernized solutions like XRP risk losing relevance and customers in an increasingly competitive market. Others took a more cautious approach, advocating for diversification in blockchain strategies rather than relying solely on XRP. They noted that while XRP may have potential, other blockchain innovations are also advancing rapidly, and a balanced approach is essential to navigate the evolving financial landscape. These varying perspectives underline the ongoing debate about XRP’s role and the broader direction of blockchain integration in global finance. While some believe that major financial institutions could adopt XRP for settlement , liquidity provisioning, or other functions, others argue that the lack of transparent plans and definitive use cases from these institutions undermines the claim.

38335191,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=635011,1735628128,"Blockchain Bandit resurfaces after 2 years, moves all $172M in stolen Ether","The Blockchain Bandit is back. After two years of silence, the infamous crypto thief responsible for one of the most sophisticated Ethereum heists has moved 51,000 Ether—worth $172 million at today’s prices—into a single wallet. Blockchain investigator ZachXBT, who has tracked the Bandit’s exploits for years, broke the news in a Telegram post . According to him, the stolen funds were moved from ten separate wallets into a multi-signature address—“0xC45…1D542.” This consolidation happened in batches of 5,000 Ether each, all within a span of 24 minutes. The transfers started at 8:54 pm UTC and wrapped up by 9:18 pm UTC. As of press time, there hasn’t been any noticeable effects to Ether’s prices. The Ethercombing mastermind The Blockchain Bandit earned their name between 2016 and 2018 after they pulled off a stunning series of hacks using a technique called “Ethercombing.” The method? Exploiting weak private keys. By taking advantage of flaws in Ethereum’s early key generation processes, the Bandit managed to guess private keys tied to active wallets. This was systematic. Over roughly 49,060 transactions, the hacker raked in close to 45,000 Ether, uncovering a total of 732 private keys. It was all about poorly secured cryptography. Issues like predictable random number generation and sloppy coding practices left many wallets vulnerable. The Bandit automated the process, scanning thousands of potential keys to find the weakest links. Fast forward to today, and those early vulnerabilities are still haunting Ethereum users. The 51,000 Ether that was moved recently is the same stash that had been sitting untouched since January 21, 2023. On that day, the hacker had previously shifted the funds from a prior location, along with 470 Bitcoin, to keep their loot under the radar. North Korean links? The Blockchain Bandit’s operation has drawn more than just technical scrutiny. Some cybersecurity analysts suspect a connection to North Korean hacker groups . These groups are infamous for targeting crypto platforms to fund state-sponsored activities, including weapons programs. The Bandit’s methods and the sheer size of the theft look a lot like the tactics used by Lazarus, the secretive hacker group linked to North Korea. A closer look at the Bandit’s methods shows just how much of the problem lies with users themselves. Weak private keys were a goldmine for this hacker, and they didn’t need to break into exchanges or bypass high-end security systems. They simply took advantage of lazy coding and user negligence. Even today, many users fail to follow basic security protocols. Poorly chosen passwords, reliance on default settings, and a lack of understanding about private key management all contribute to the ongoing risks. Ethereum’s early vulnerabilities didn’t help, either. Developers are now working hard to become better at coding practices, but in this case, the damage is already done. The Bandit’s automated key-scanning system exploited those flaws at scale, draining wallets with shocking efficiency.

38336248,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53501,1735627628,"Ripple-SEC Case Could Be Dropped, Says Fox Business’s Charles Gasparino","In a recent appearance on Anthony Pompliano’s podcast , Fox Business Senior Correspondent Charles Gasparino criticized the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approach to the Ripple case, describing it as an instance of regulatory overreach. He expressed concerns that the SEC’s actions have driven Ripple’s innovative technology overseas due to a lack of clear regulatory guidelines. Gasparino’s Critique of SEC’s Handling of Ripple Case Gasparino also commented on Judge Analisa Torres’s ruling in the case, labeling it “idiotic.” He argued that the decision established a precedent where retail investors receive less disclosure compared to institutional investors, potentially undermining investor protections. Looking ahead, Gasparino speculated on the potential impact of political changes on the SEC’s handling of the Ripple case. He suggested that with the inauguration of President Donald Trump and the anticipated appointment of Paul Atkins as SEC Chair , there might be a shift in the Commission’s stance. This could lead to the SEC overturning the programmatic sales ruling or possibly dropping the appeal altogether. Upcoming Legal Deadlines and Proceedings The SEC’s appeal process is currently underway, with important deadlines approaching. The agency’s filing deadline for the appeal is January 15, 2025, following a 90-day extension requested in October. Transcripts for the appeal are scheduled to be ordered by December 31, 2024, and must be fully delivered by January 30, 2025. March 2025 is expected to be a critical month, during which the plaintiff will present arguments against Ripple and its CEO, Brad Garlinghouse. Ripple Labs and Garlinghouse are required to respond by April 7, 2025. Gasparino emphasized his commitment to journalistic neutrality, stating that he will continue to cover the story objectively, regardless of the outcome, as he does not hold any XRP. He acknowledged receiving criticism from both pro-crypto and anti-crypto communities, underscoring the contentious nature of the debate. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Community Members Respond In response to Gasparino’s remarks, the crypto community members have offered differing perspectives. Crypto influencer Tony Edward accused Gasparino of bias, suggesting that his stance indicates a desire for Ripple to lose the case. Edward contended that Judge Torres’s ruling appropriately distinguished between institutional sales and secondary market transactions, noting that many investors in secondary markets are not directly connected to Ripple. Additionally, lawyer Bill Morgan criticized Gasparino’s understanding of the case, asserting that the ruling addressed only Ripple’s programmatic sales and not all secondary market transactions. Morgan stated , “As for Charles Gasparino, it is quite apparent he does not understand XRP or crypto.” The Ripple case keeps being a focal point in the ongoing discourse surrounding cryptocurrency regulation. The outcome of the SEC’s appeal and potential shifts in regulatory leadership are anticipated to have significant implications for Ripple, XRP, and the broader crypto industry.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Yeti Ouro, a new Dogecoin rival, attracts investors to its presale with its unique ecosystem. Table of Contents Yeti Ouro: The new meme coin that can do it all A unique token economy A successful start A serious Dogecoin rival The road ahead Dogecoin is the original meme coin and leader. But now, another challenger is emerging. The unique mix of utility and community-driven growth makes Yeti Ouro (YETIO) stand out from the crowd. The project’s ambitious vision and robust ecosystem have attracted investors to its presale. Yeti Ouro: The new meme coin that can do it all Yeti Ouro is different from most meme coins, its trailer brings real-world utility. It’s built to fuel a nascent gaming ecosystem, making it much more than a lot of hot air. What stands at the heart of Yeti Ouro is the Play-to-Earn (P2E) aspect, providing gamers and investors with rewards. Its flagship game, Yeti Go, is an Action PvP racing game powered by the Unreal engine. Players can battle, gather power-ups and avoid exciting hazards. What really makes it stand out is the inclusion of the YETIO token. A unique token economy Another remarkable aspect of Yeti Ouro is its well-prepared token economy. They can be enrolled for an equivalent of 1 billion supply of tokens. And unlike inflation-heavy meme coins, YETIO’s limited supply allows it to preserve long-term value. Yeti Ouro will also integrate a token burn mechanism to increase value further. Some of those tokens will be burned when playing and buying things in-game. This increases scarcity and potential price over time. Beyond gaming utility, the YETIO token will also provide staking rewards. Investors can lock their tokens and earn passive income. The result is a dual benefit (playing the game and staking assets), which is why people from all walks of life have been interested in investing in one or multiple play-to-earn games, ranging from gamers to crypto supporters and anyone in between. A successful start Yeti Ouro’s presale is already making waves. Stage 1 sold out early, accumulating $1.2 million in record time. Early backers seized on the project’s promise and soon locked it down. Now, presale Stage 2 is live, and demand is still sky-high. The low entry cost and the potential for a massive increase attracts investors. As adoption grows, analysts have predicted 50x to 100x returns from YETIO. 5 reasons why investors are opting for Yeti Ouro: Real utility: Unlike Dogecoin, Yeti Oura integrates directly into a gaming ecosystem. Players must have YETIO to play the game, trade assets, and engage in the economy. Fixed supply: YETIO’s total supply of 1 billion tokens prevents the supply challenges many meme coins face. Play-to-Earn gaming: Everyone knows the gaming market is on fire and Yeti Go comes on top with a premium quality P2E experience. Passive income: It’s possible to earn with YETIO by staking. This connects immediate gratification to long-term payoff. Community-focused expansion: Yeti Ouro is focused on community-driven growth, actively developing a strong core of supporters. A serious Dogecoin rival All things considered, despite its popularity Dogecoin is simply a meme with little utility. Yeti Ouro challenges that status quo. It seeks to pair meme coin hype with practical use. This makes it a strong competitor to Dogecoin and other well-known altcoins. Yeti Ouro’s gaming aspect also taps into a huge market. The P2E industry is expected to expand explosively in the coming years. The project aims at promoting constant demand and sustainable price appreciation by linking the YETIO token with the functional economy of the game. Meanwhile, the Yeti Ouro meme contest has wrapped up, with some of the participants sharing their innovative creations: https://twitter.com/nayansingh08/status/1871866750641532951?s=10 The road ahead Momentum is growing as Stage 2 of the presale continues. The Yeti Ouro team is focused on launching additional features, such as marketplace integrations and new games. This will further enhance the Yeti Ouro ecosystem. Even for young investors, the opportunity is evident. Yeti Ouro is the right blend of hype, utility, and growth potential. With its unique approach and impressive presale results, YETIO could be the next breakout token in the cryptocurrency market.

The sector is expected to explode soon and kickstart the long-awaited “Altseason” after retesting a key support level. Related Reading: Ethereum Stays Within Symmetrical Pattern – Analyst Sets ETH Target Altcoins Retest Key Support Level Amid the recent market’s performance, many Altcoins have struggled to record significant gains. However, several market watchers forecasted the start of the altcoin will come as soon as January 2025. Fueled by the post-US election pump, the total crypto market capitalization, excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum, broke out on a three-year downtrend in mid-November, surpassing its yearly high of $788 billion. During this month’s rally, the sector surged to $1.1 trillion, its highest market cap since 2021. Since then, Altcoins has struggled over the last two weeks, dropping nearly 26% as Bitcoin lost the $100,000 mark but remains above a key level despite the recent performance. Crypto Jelle pointed out that the sector broke out and retested its “major trendline while destroying all leverage in the process.” The analyst highlighted that funding was “completely reset,” sentiment has been at its lowest, and the chart seems promising, adding he is “Very bullish for 2025.” He also noted that Altcoins’ price action is “very similar” to Bitcoin’s first major pullback of 2021. Per the chart, the flagship crypto had a “strong rally, pullback, lower high, and chopping below the first low” before breaking out to new highs. Based on this performance, Altcoins’ pullback is seemingly over, they “should start pushing back up soon if this keeps playing out the same.” Similarly, Michaël van de Poppe stated, “The correction is almost over, and the time for up only is on the horizon for Altcoins and Bitcoin. Expecting a lot to come.” Altseason To Follow 2021’s Playbook? Titan of Crypto asserted that Altcoins are set to explode soon, suggesting that “the grand finale is around the corner.” Per the analyst’s chart, Altcoins have been in a two-year cup and handle pattern, breaking out of the pattern’s upper line during the recent market highs. According to the pattern, Altcoins, excluding ETH, could see a 200% to a market capitalization of $1.4 trillion, surpassing 2021’s high of $1.13 trillion. The analyst also pointed out that, ahead of its 2021 rally, the sector saw a similar performance. In 2020, Altcoins broke out in November and saw a significant 30% drop in early December, followed by a four-week recovery. Then, they recorded a 143% surge in January 2021, which led to other three-monthly green candles before the first major retrace. Related Reading: Top Crypto Assets For Q1 2025: Grayscale Reveals The Best Altcoins Similarly, they’ve experienced a 26% drop this December, currently being on the third week out of the expected four-week recovery period. To the analyst, “Early January could mark the start of an ‘up only’ season.” Lastly, Titan of Crypto added that, during the last two cycles, Altcoins’ initial rally lasted between 140 and 175 days, suggesting that this cycle’s rally could hit a new high around April or May. If it were to follow the past cycles’ performance, it could see a first pump around Q2 2025 before peaking in Q4.

38334639,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53479,1735626633,"Traders Believe In Stellar, Near Protocol, And New Crypto Rollblock For Massive Gains In Coming Months","Stellar (XLM) and NEAR are predicted to reach new ATHs in 2025. However, Rollblock (RBLK), a new crypto on Ethereum’s GambleFi sector, is expected to stage a moonshot in the coming months, delivering massive gains to investors. Let’s find out why analysts praise RBLK as a better investment option than XLM and NEAR . Rollblock (RBLK): a new crypto predicted to deliver 50x in 2025 Investors seeking outsized returns are leaning toward the Rollblock (RBLK) new crypto presale. The GambleFi token has blasted 340% since its debut in the ICO market! But the RBLK moonshot is far from over. Per crypto analysts, the altcoin is expected to stage another 540% raise before the presale ends and could explode over 50x upon its launch in the open market. Two major bullish factors are driving the RBLK historic surge: its growth potential in the half-trillion online casino market and executive revenue-sharing benefits to players and investors. A portion of the weekly revenues collected on the Rollblock crypto casino is redistributed to RBLK holders, with investors earning up to 30% APY in passive income for providing liquidity. More interestingly, this emerging iGaming powerhouse is set to revolutionize the $540 gambling industry with a blockchain-powered fair gaming process, AI-driven gambling ecosystem, and copy-betting player initiatives. If Rollblock manages to capture even a sliver of this market, it will grow into a multi-billion crypto gambling platform, pushing the RBLK market cap into the billions. That will pump the token price to dizzy heights. Stellar (XLM) moonshot curtailed XLM almost blew past its ATH in its recent moonsho t, rocketing nearly 8x from lows of $0.08 to hit $0.63. But investors have been locking gains lately, pushing the XLM price down to the $0.35 zone. As of press time, XLM was down over 25% monthly, slashing its yearly gains to 175%. However, an 88% bullish community sentiment and positive analysts’ predictions show that XLM might just be taking a breather. Per CoinCodex, XLM is predicted to skyrocket over 290% in 2025 and could hit $1.3 by May. Thus, the current downturn gives investors a low entry window to double up. NEAR trades at a critical zone NEAR hasn’t had a chance for a moonshot in 2024 and has only managed to deliver a dull 49% year-to-date return. A 20% monthly crash pushed NEAR down to a critical buy zone in the $5 region, the same level it blasted from to hit $20 in 2021. Should history repeat itself, NEAR could surge upwards from here to scale new heights in 2025, and analyst predictions show it might.

38334358,https://coinpedia.org/?p=400292,1735626597,Cardano (ADA) Price Prediction for December 31,"The post Cardano (ADA) Price Prediction for December 31 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The cryptocurrency market is on edge, and Cardano’s native token , ADA, seems to be following suit. With prices trending downward, ADA’s future looks uncertain as market pressures mount. The formation of bearish patterns and ongoing sentiment shifts suggest that more declines could be ahead. As of December 31, 2024, leading cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL) continue to face challenges in gaining upward momentum. This broader market weakness has added to ADA’s difficulties, keeping its outlook bearish. Read on to discover what the charts are signaling for ADA in the coming days. Cardano (ADA) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels Technical analysis points to a bleak short-term future for ADA. The token has formed a descending triangle pattern on its daily chart, a bearish signal that often precedes a breakdown. This comes after the completion of a head-and-shoulders pattern, which triggered the current downtrend. Source: Trading View If ADA falls below the key support level of $0.825 and closes a daily candle beneath it, analysts predict a 10% drop, with the next target around $0.75. However, ADA’s bearish trend depends on breaking this support. If the token holds above $0.825, it may avoid further losses or even stabilize. Investors Remain Confident While short-term indicators suggest caution, long-term holders appear to maintain strong confidence in ADA. According to Coinglass , $37.92 million worth of ADA has been withdrawn from exchanges, indicating significant outflows to private wallets. Source: Coinglass Such outflows typically reduce sell-side pressure and can signal buying interest, suggesting investors see current prices as an opportunity for accumulation. Traders, however, are more cautious. As ADA nears critical support, many are unwilling to take new positions, leading to the liquidation of millions in long positions. Open interest in ADA has dropped by 3.9% over the past 24 hours, highlighting this hesitation. What Next for ADA Price? At the time of writing, ADA is trading near $0.8456, down 3.15% in the past 24 hours. During this time, trading volume has risen by 15%, showing increased activity from traders and investors. This surge in trading activity suggests growing interest as ADA approaches a pivotal price point. Whether the token breaks below its support level or manages to hold steady will likely set the tone for its price direction as the new year begins.",NEGATIVE,ADA | BTC | ETH,ADA | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/cardano-ada-price-prediction-for-december-31/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Riding this wave, Web3Bay (3Bay) is making waves in e-commerce, facilitating direct exchanges between buyers and sellers, slashing prices, and securing data privacy with its blockchain-driven solutions. Simultaneously, Casper Network is turning heads with an astounding 86.3% leap in value, showcasing its robust allure for enterprises through scalable and secure blockchain apps. Equally, Bybit is broadening the horizons for The Open Network (TON) blockchain, capitalizing on strategic alliances and community involvement to supercharge TON’s ecosystem. Both Casper and Bybit are parading the financial and technical muscle of blockchain, but it’s Web3Bay that’s truly remixing how we shop online with its fresh take on e-commerce. Web3Bay Rewrites the E-Commerce Playbook Web3Bay is reshaping online shopping by debuting a blockchain platform that puts transparency, fairness, and efficiency front and center. Unlike traditional e-commerce behemoths that often hike up fees and centralize power, Web3Bay breaks the mold, allowing buyers and sellers to connect directly. This pivotal change cuts out middlemen, driving down costs and speeding up transactions. Plus, by harnessing smart contracts, Web3Bay locks in secure and immutable agreements, cementing trust with each transaction. This strategy paints a picture of a marketplace that’s not just different, but better. Sellers pocket more for their products while buyers snag deals at lower prices. With the digital world buzzing about privacy and data breaches, Web3Bay’s decentralized data solutions put privacy power back in the hands of users. This commitment to ethical, secure shopping solutions is propelling Web3Bay to the forefront as a trailblazer in online retail. The 3BAY token amplifies this impact by empowering holders to steer the platform’s future, from upgrades to policy shifts.

At the Bangkok Hackers League Bootcamp, MK Chin, Bybit Web3’s marketing guru, tackled the technical ins and outs and the challenges of building on the TON blockchain. Stephy Shi, head of product operations, also shone a spotlight on the crucial role of Telegram integrations and community ties at the TON & Telegram Eco Summit, underlining these as essentials for the enduring uptake of TON tech. Casper Network Captivates with a 86% Market Surge The Casper Network (CSPR) has dazzled the crypto stage with an extraordinary 86.3% price surge, positioning itself as a beacon in the crypto universe. This impressive climb signals a growing trust in Casper’s business-focused blockchain solutions, tailored for scalability, security, and decentralized applications.

For instance, Marlin (POND) skyrocketed 76.7% thanks to its cutting-edge decentralized data delivery network, while LimeWire (LMWR) ascended 71.6%, revitalizing its NFT marketplace. DAO Maker (DAO) also soared 68.9%, powered by its dominance in decentralized finance (DeFi). Additional standouts include LooksRare (LOOKS), which advanced 58.8% through novel NFT reward mechanisms, and Secret Network (SCRT), which climbed 58.6% for enhancing privacy.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Yeti Ouro emerges as a standout in the crypto space, blending gaming utility with deflationary mechanics, as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu regain market attention. Table of Contents Dogecoin analysis: Is a rally on the horizon Shiba Inu forecast: Whale activity explodes Yeti Ouro: The new gaming sensation Here’s what investors love about Yeti Ouro: Why Yeti Ouro stands out Final thoughts Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) are back in the spotlight. Dogecoin rallies while Shiba Inu reactor whales exodus sparks interest. But the most interesting find is Yeti Ouro (YETIO), the new altcoin transforming the gaming world. Its unique model and successful presale are gaining a lot of buzz. Crypto investors are keeping a close eye on these three tokens, but Yeti Ouro is a dark horse with massive growth potential. Dogecoin analysis: Is a rally on the horizon Dogecoin price has been on a tear recently. And market indicators suggest that it may be setting itself up for another big rally. It comes as activity in the DOGE community grows and trading volumes leap. Dogecoin rallies have often been inspired by community backing and social media attention. Analysts now suggest that DOGE price will break its recent resistance level. And with renewed interest in the rest of the crypto space, Dogecoin could surge again. Couple this rise with some positive sentiment for long-term holders. However, DOGE’s capacity to engage with mainstream media still arguably makes it a superior older meme coin. Shiba Inu forecast: Whale activity explodes Whale activity for Shiba Inu is once again riding a huge wave. In the last 24 hours, SHIB orders have increased by 265%, according to IntoTheBlock. This means that whale activity has increased the volume of large transactions to 375 trillion SHIB tokens. When there is whale activity, however, it often means a big move is coming to a token. Now, investors are left wondering what could be behind this latest next rush. This may be due to recent Shibarium upgrades or new happenings in the SHIB ecosystem. As SHIB struggles to reclaim old prices, those large transactions indicate growing confidence among institutional participants. If the trend is maintained, SHIB price may drop another zero and please its faithful holders. Yeti Ouro: The new gaming sensation Dogecoin and Shiba Inu slightly dominate the meme coin space, but Yeti Ouro promises to take things to a whole new level. Yeti Ouro pairs gaming and real utility — something fun, unlike traditional meme tokens. It drives a Play-to-Earn (P2E) racing game called Yeti Go, based on Unreal Engine. You might also like: DOGE aims $1.5 by 2025; investors seen investing in Yeti Ouro dominating the DeFi market Here’s what investors love about Yeti Ouro: Gaming utility: Players receive YETIO tokens by competing in PvP races and challenges. YETIO staking: Investors can stake YETIO for passive income and high APY. Deflation: There is a regular burning of a percentage of tokens, resulting in a decrease in supply. Mass appeal: The game’s chaotic, fun-filled gameplay draws in gamers and crypto investors. Yeti Ouro is already sitting on a presale of over $1.4 million, a sign of investor confidence. Most of the previous altcoin projects storming or following the trail have ignored the monetization of super-quality gameplay and token utility. Meanwhile, the Yeti Ouro meme contest has wrapped up, with some of the participants sharing their innovative creations. https://twitter.com/nayansingh08/status/1871866750641532951?s=10 Why Yeti Ouro stands out The gaming industry is thriving, and Yeti Ouro will take advantage of this multi-billion-dollar Market. It has a solid advantage thanks to its combination of Play-to-Earn mechanics and community-driven additions. Yeti Ouro offers a physical product, unlike popular community tokens like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Its P2E model allows players to enjoy themselves while making money. These two inextricably linked purposes bring casual gamers and serious investors on board. Moreover, the presale of Yeti Ouro has proven that the Yeti Ouro can draw attention. YETIO represents one of the most promising prospects for investors searching for the next big thing, with potential 100x returns. Final thoughts As Dogecoin and Shiba Inu storm the hubs, their competition is catching up. DOGE signals a rally, while SHIB`s whale movements indicate volatility. Yeti Ouro, however, is leveraging its gaming utility and presale hype. With the growth of the crypto market, projects like Yeti Ouro are blazing trails. Its blend of gaming, incentives, and community involvement uniquely positions it. Yeti Ouro is quickly rising and is a no-brainer for long-run investors. Keep an eye on this rising star.

38333669,https://crypto.news/?p=14323450,1735625018,Blockchain Bandit moves $172m in Ethereum after 2 years of inactivity,"The infamous hacker group, under the guise of “Blockchain Bandit,” made a grand comeback with a sensation of merging 51,000 Ether into a single wallet, which totaled $172.2 million, almost two years after being inactive. Funds transfer occurred between 8:54 pm and 9:18 pm UTC on Dec. 30 from 10 inactive wallet addresses into a multi-signature wallet labeled as “0xC45…1D542.” Each transaction accounted for 5,000 ETH. Among them, the ones that had been on Jan. 21, 2023, all were the ones that the blockchain bandit transferred 470 Bitcoin ( BTC ) along with Ethereum ( ETH ).

As for the crypto security expert Adrian Bednarek, the hacker was able to break 732 private keys, corresponding with 49,060 transactions. https://twitter.com/PixOnChain/status/1873890341189017914 The bandit started in 2016, but most of the theft cases were in 2018. After eight months, he had already generated 45,000 ETH through programmatic theft; this activity made him the biggest threat in the crypto world. This incident became a real thorn in the side of the rise in the number of crypto thefts that have been happening over the last few years. The comeback of the Blockchain Bandit highlights, at the same time, the crypto vulnerabilities that are an inevitable part of the blockchain ecosystem. In a report from onchain security firm Cyvers, the total amount of money stolen in 165 security incidents in 2024 was around $2.3 billion, which was a 40% rise from the previous year. 81% of the total lost money, or $1.9 billion, was the result of access control breaches on the centralized exchanges and custodial platforms, with major focus on pig butchering scams.

38333610,https://coinpaper.com/6749/tether-joins-corporate-bitcoin-buying-spree-with-major-purchase,1735624938,Tether Joins Corporate Bitcoin Buying Spree with Major Purchase,"Tether is now ranked as the second-largest private Bitcoin holder with 90,083 BTC. Meanwhile, MicroStrategy also expanded its Bitcoin portfolio with a $209 million purchase. Hong Kong lawmakers proposed incorporating Bitcoin into national reserves due to its potential to improve financial stability and attract global investment. As 2024 ends, Bitcoin's inability to sustain its recent all-time high also sparked some concerns, and technical analysts warned of a potential dip to $78,000 that could impact its trajectory into 2025. Tether Boosts Bitcoin Holdings Tether, the issuer of the USDT stablecoin, has made a big addition to its Bitcoin (BTC) reserves by transferring close to $780 million worth of BTC to its corporate treasury. This was the company’s largest Bitcoin purchase since March and aligns with its May 2023 announcement to allocate up to 15% of its net realized operating profits toward acquiring Bitcoin. According to data from Arkham Intelligence, Tether’s Bitcoin reserve wallets received two large transfers on Dec. 30, totaling approximately 8,404.5 BTC. As Bitcoin was trading at around $92,500, the latest additions are valued at about $777.4 million. This brought Tether’s total holdings to 90,083 BTC, which is worth nearly $8.3 billion. Private companies holding Bitcoin (Source: Bitcoin Treasuries ) This latest move happened after Tether’s previous purchase on March 31, when the firm bought 8,888.88 BTC shortly after Bitcoin passed the $70,000 mark. Bitcoin’s price doubled over 2024 and gained more than 108% year-to-date despite recent declines from its mid-December all-time high. Tether now ranks as the second-largest private Bitcoin holder, with its holdings trailing only the 140,000 BTC held by blockchain software firm Block.one. In the overall rankings, including public companies, Tether holds the third position, with MicroStrategy leading the list with a staggering 446,400 BTC. The surge in Bitcoin’s price certainly encouraged more corporations to add the cryptocurrency to their treasuries. KULR Technology Group also recently invested $21 million in Bitcoin by buying 217.18 BTC. This led to a 40% increase in its stock price. Similarly, Quantum BioPharma recently announced a $1 million investment in Bitcoin and other crypto assets to diversify its own treasury. MicroStrategy Expands Bitcoin Portfolio Again MicroStrategy, the business intelligence firm and prominent Bitcoin investor, also recently expanded its Bitcoin holdings by acquiring 2,138 BTC for $209 million. The company announced that it made the purchase between Dec. 23 and 29, and paid an average price of about $97,837 per BTC. The acquisition was funded by selling 592,987 shares during the same week. The firm’s Bitcoin yield has shown great performance, with a year-to-date increase of 74.1% as of Dec. 30 and a quarterly yield of 47.8% for the period from Oct. 1 to Dec. 29. This was the eighth consecutive week that MicroStrategy added Bitcoin to its holdings as the company purchased BTC weekly since Oct. 31. Over this period, the firm acquired a total of 194,180 BTC. However, the volume of Bitcoin that was bought has declined compared to November when MicroStrategy purchased over 100,000 BTC. Michael Saylor, co-founder and executive chairman of MicroStrategy, teased the latest acquisition on Dec. 29 by hinting at “disconcerting” patterns on Saylor Tracker, a platform monitoring the company’s Bitcoin investments. Saylor also once again reiterated that MicroStrategy is still very much committed to purchasing Bitcoin at any price, even if it reaches $1 million per coin. In addition to its latest acquisition, MicroStrategy is looking to increase its capacity to issue shares. A Dec. 23 filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) revealed that the company plans to raise the number of authorized Class A common stock from 330 million shares to 10.33 billion shares and authorized preferred stock from 5 million to over 1 billion shares. This move will provide better flexibility for the company to issue additional shares and potentially fund more Bitcoin purchases in the future. Bitcoin as a Reserve Asset Gains Traction in Hong Kong A Hong Kong legislator proposed integrating Bitcoin into the special administrative region's national reserves to boost financial security and attract new investment. Wu Jiexhuang, a member of Hong Kong’s Legislative Council, suggested leveraging China’s “one country, two systems” policy to explore Bitcoin’s potential as a reserve asset. Speaking to state-owned newspaper Wen Wei Po, Jiexhuang talked about the strategic steps smaller nations like El Salvador and Bhutan have taken by incorporating Bitcoin into their reserves, as well as proposals by US President-elect Donald Trump to make Bitcoin a strategic asset. Jiexhuang argued that Hong Kong could initially include Bitcoin in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to evaluate its market impact before considering a broader integration into its reserves. He also pointed out Bitcoin’s potential to attract global talent and investment while still providing financial stability amid market volatility. He also believes that holding Bitcoin as a reserve asset could mitigate the risks associated with its growing adoption in traditional markets, giving Hong Kong a first-mover advantage. The legislator stated that major economic powers adopting Bitcoin in their reserves could stabilize its value and encourage other nations to follow suit and shift away from traditional assets. This, he suggested, could lead to declining values for traditional assets and affect governments’ fiscal reserves. Hong Kong’s Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau is expected to develop crypto regulations under the principle of “same business, same risks, same rules,” aligning with broader global standards. The region’s focus on Bitcoin aligns with China’s large Bitcoin holdings, which amount to about 190,000 BTC that was acquired through confiscations, placing it second only to the United States in terms of national Bitcoin reserves. This proposal was made after earlier discussions by another Legislative Council member, Johnny Ng , who announced plans to explore Bitcoin’s feasibility as part of Hong Kong’s financial reserves. Ng pointed to the growing global recognition of Bitcoin as a critical factor in its integration into traditional financial systems. Market Awaits Bitcoin’s Next Move Into 2025 As 2024 draws to a close, the crypto market is fixated on Bitcoin's price trajectory heading into 2025. Despite achieving a new all-time high earlier this month, Bitcoin has since dipped below that mark, and raised concerns among market participants. It seems like the leading cryptocurrency's inability to sustain its peak is being interpreted as a sign of market weakness. The broader crypto market, buoyed this year by institutional interest from firms like BlackRock, Fidelity, and pension funds due to the launch of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, has not been immune to year-end declines. These downward trends dampened hopes for Bitcoin to close the year with a six-figure price. Veteran trader Peter Brandt added to the conversation with a technical analysis of Bitcoin’s price chart. According to Brandt, a head-and-shoulders pattern is forming, which suggests a potential drop to $78,000 per Bitcoin if the pattern plays out. While he acknowledges the possibility of the pattern failing or morphing, he still warned traders to act on the pattern as it currently stands. A decline like this would represent a 15+% drop from current levels but could also serve to close a big price gap on the CME that has been unresolved for nearly two months. For some analysts, addressing this gap could provide a cleaner slate for Bitcoin as it moves into 2025, and could also potentially offer a foundation for future upward momentum.",POSITIVE,BTC | USDT,ASIA | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | USDT,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6749/tether-joins-corporate-bitcoin-buying-spree-with-major-purchase,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

XRP’s price is down 2% in the last 24 hours, while the won continues to trade below 1,470 per dollar. The arrest warrant issued against former President Yoon Suk Yeol has exacerbated market fears both locally and globally. On Tuesday, the Seoul Western District Court issued a search warrant for Yoon’s residence and an arrest warrant for his attempts to impose martial law during a live televised address on December 3. South Korea issues arrest warrant for impeached President Yoon https://t.co/yYqMG3U8qs — Financial Times (@FT) December 31, 2024 This marks the first time in South Korean history that an arrest warrant has been issued against an incumbent president. The warrants followed Yoon’s repeated refusals to comply with the summons from the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials (CIO), which is investigating him for treason and abuse of power. Yoon’s televised imposition of martial law, justified by claims of addressing “anti-state elements” and “North Korean threats,” drew sharp criticism. South Korea’s parliament quickly overturned the move on December 4, but the political fallout has been severe. The ripple effect on cryptocurrency markets South Korea’s political crisis has extended its influence to the cryptocurrency sector. Major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and XRP, experienced a brief slump of up to 4% during Yoon’s short-lived martial law declaration. Domestically, crypto trading spiked to its second-highest level this year, with retail traders actively pursuing “high-momentum” altcoins such as XRP and Dogecoin. Although the crypto market recovered after parliament overturned the martial law order, recent price movements continue to reflect volatility. Bitcoin fell below $93,000, currently changing hands at $92,500, a 0.6% decline over the past 24 hours, with its trading volume surging by 62% to go past $55 billion. Ethereum dropped 2.4%, trading slightly above $3,300, while its trading volume increased by 56%, reaching $25.52 billion at press time, per Coingecko data . XRP, closely tied to South Korean retail trading trends, saw its price decline by 2% in the last 24 hours on the country’s largest digital currency exchange Upbit . It is currently trading below 3,000 won, going down 12% over the past week. XRP/KRW Upbit chart. Source: TradingView. The downturn coincides with broader market sentiment, as the global cryptocurrency market cap decreased by 1.3% to $3.22 trillion. However, trading volumes surged by 40%, and investors could be looking to cash in on profits as 2024 nears sunset. Won hits 16-year low as political tensions amplify economic struggles South Korea’s Won has taken a significant hit during this period of political instability. The won fell below 1,470 per dollar, marking its lowest levels in 16 years, according to market data from Trading Economics. The currency’s value has declined by over 12% this year, making it the weakest currency in emerging Asia. The economic downturn has been fueled by political tensions, concerns over economic mismanagement, and fears of US tariffs. The Bank of Korea’s decision to reduce its benchmark interest rate to 3% in December, following inflation levels dropping to 1.9%, has done little to offset the won’s decline. The central bank’s plans for further rate cuts next year aim to stabilize the monetary system, though challenges remain with a strong dollar driven by the Federal Reserve’s hawkish policies and the incoming US administration’s outlook.

Musk AI King (MUSKAI), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKAI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk AI King can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk AI King could become the next viral memecoin. Musk AI King launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk AI King on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk AI King by entering its contract address – 8hfjjhqWbfVZsqxCKVQu115AXUzUPTHZFXZwk81rYTMw – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKAI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/solana-memecoin-musk-ai-king-muskai-will-skyrocket-16000-ahead-of-first-exchange-listing/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png
38333389,https://coinpedia.org/?p=400265,1735624488,YouTube Crypto Scam Turns Thieves into Victims – Here’s How,"The post YouTube Crypto Scam Turns Thieves into Victims – Here’s How appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Crypto fraudsters have come up with a clever new scam that turns would-be thieves into their next victims. Spotted mainly on YouTube, this scheme uses fake comments to lure people with seed phrases to wallets that seem to hold thousands of dollars in cryptocurrency. What starts as a golden opportunity quickly turns into a cunning trap. But how does the scam work, and why are even the “lucky” ones losing out? Read on. How the Scam Works The scam looks straightforward. Fraudsters pose as amateur traders claiming they’ve “accidentally” left large amounts of stablecoins , like USDT, in wallets on the Tron blockchain. They even share the seed phrases, making it appear easy to access the funds—sometimes as much as $8,000. Once inside the wallet, the unsuspecting thief discovers they need to send a small amount of Tron (TRX) to cover gas fees to withdraw the funds. But here’s the twist: as soon as TRX is sent, the tokens are redirected to a different wallet controlled by the scammers. The victim, thinking they’re about to strike gold, ends up losing their own money instead. Understanding the TRX Gas Fee Trap What makes this scam so effective is its use of multi-signature wallets, which require multiple approvals for transactions. The thief tries to withdraw the funds, unaware they’re triggering mechanisms that make the scammers even richer. According to cybersecurity firm Kaspersky, this operation specifically targets immoral individuals rather than regular crypto users. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Hacks This Week: Pudgy Penguins Phishing Scam Leads the Pack , Tips to Stay Safe While the losses per victim might be small, this scam highlights how crypto fraud is becoming more complex.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Rollblock emerges at the intersection of DeFi and iGaming, with analysts projecting significant growth during its presale and beyond. Table of Contents Rollblock offers the perfect blend of DeFi and iGaming Ripple sees 7% decline in 7 days Cardano sees a major December dip Sui drops 5% in 5 days Rollblock continues to gain momentum 2024 has been a huge year for both the DeFi and iGaming spaces. With the market expanding as 2025 approaches, investors are wondering where to focus their efforts. While Ripple (XRP), Cardano (ADA), and Sui (SUI) have been strong investments historically, an exciting new project has been tipped to outperform them all: Rollblock (RBLK). This project has emerged from the intersection of iGaming and DeFi, blending the two together to create a decentralized gaming experience. The project is currently seeing major attention from across the investing spectrum, with analysts predicting an 800% increase during the presale and further gains post-launch. Rollblock offers the perfect blend of DeFi and iGaming A casino with a broad offering Rollblock is a Hybrid GambleFi platform that blends traditional casino entertainment with decentralized finance. As the world’s first community-backed casino and Play-to-Earn token, Rollblock empowers users to earn, play, and invest in a secure and transparent ecosystem. The platform offers a range of over 7000 games, including the best of both casino and virtual games, and accepts cryptocurrency deposits. In addition, there is a comprehensive sportsbook, and a range of exciting player-vs-player options on offer for those with a competitive nature. The native token: RBLK At the center of the Rollblock platform is the project’s native token, RBLK. This token differentiates itself from the rest with some appealing benefits for holders. A significant 30% of Rollblock’s weekly profits are used to buy back RBLK tokens, and of these tokens, 60% are burned permanently to introduce scarcity and boost the value of the token. The remaining tokens are rewarded to users who have chosen to stake RBLK, with generous APY rates offering a lucrative passive income stream for token holders. Hybrid infrastructure: Built for functionality The platform’s hybrid infrastructure model combines the best of both worlds: decentralized, on-chain transparency, but with the robust functionality of a traditional casino. With its decentralized approach, AI tools, and passive income potential, Rollblock is the perfect destination for Gen-Z bettors and crypto enthusiasts who want autonomy, transparency, and profitability in their gaming experience.

Despite Ripple’s strong annual performance, XRP could now see a harsh corrective price action. Ripple lost 7% of its value in the last 7 days, and XRP’s price dropped even more significantly over the last 24 hours. Having held a value of $2.15 at midday on the 29th December, it dropped down to $2.03 by the same time on the 30th December. Cardano sees a major December dip Cardano performed poorly through 2024 despite a broader crypto space expansion. With 2025 around the corner, Cardano’s value dropped 18% in the last month. Cardano now looks like it could fall below the $30 billion mark, causing some Cardano holders to sell up. Cardano sank from $0.94 on 24th December to $0.85 on the 29th, marking a disappointing end to the year for Cardano. Sui drops 5% in 5 days Sui had a strong year overall with a 421% increase, though it has dropped 5% in the last 5 days, raising questions as to how Sui might perform in 2025. The Sui developers have been focused on improving accessibility this year. Sui’s mainnet is now supported by over 100 validators, so there is a glimmer of hope for Sui holders. Rollblock continues to gain momentum Sporting more than 7000 games, AI-powered betting tools, and community projects, Rollblock is an entertaining gaming destination for all. Today, with the presale in its ninth stage, RBLK tokens are trading at $0.0044, and analysts expect 800% growth pre-launch and 100x growth post-launch. With this in mind, there is no better time than now to join a platform likely to shape the future of DeFi and iGaming. To learn more about Rollblock, visit the website and its socials .

38334638,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53499,1735623611,Most XRP Holders Set First Exit At $100,"A recent Twitter poll by Digital Asset Investor (@digitalassetbuy) has attracted significant attention within the cryptocurrency community. The poll asked participants, “Where do you make your first XRP exit?” garnered over 14,000 votes. Egrag Crypto, a well-known XRP analyst, provided his insights on the results, which offer a unique perspective into investor sentiment and their expectations for XRP’s future price trajectory. $100 Exit Point (42.4%) The most popular choice, with 42.4% of respondents, was the $100 price point. Egrag Crypto highlighted this as a clear indicator of long-term optimism among XRP investors. The preference for $100 reflects strong confidence in XRP’s utility and potential role in the evolving financial system. Many in this group are likely anticipating broader adoption and significant price appreciation, showcasing their commitment to holding for the long haul. $10 (20.7%) and $20 (17.8%) Exit Points 38.5% of respondents selected either $10 or $20 as their preferred exit points. Egrag Crypto pointed out that these mid-range targets demonstrate a balanced approach to profit-taking. Investors in this category seek meaningful returns while maintaining a cautious perspective. These choices likely reflect moderate confidence in XRP’s future, tempered by the desire to de-risk their investments at these achievable milestones. $5 Exit Point (19.1%) Approximately one in five participants chose $5 as their exit target. Egrag Crypto interpreted this group as likely including early investors, or “OGs,” who may have acquired XRP at significantly lower prices. For these investors, $5 represents a substantial return on investment. This group might also include those with shorter-term financial goals or a lower tolerance for market volatility. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Egrag Crypto’s Analysis Egrag Crypto described the strong preference for a $100 exit point as a sign of unwavering belief in XRP’s potential. He emphasized that this sentiment reflects an optimistic outlook on the asset’s long-term value and utility in the global financial ecosystem. However, he also noted the diversity in exit strategies, which highlights varying levels of risk tolerance and financial objectives among investors. He advises XRP holders in his commentary: “Do what suits you—everyone has unique needs, wants, and responsibilities. However, not holding a bag for the long term may be a mistake. Patience can often lead to greater rewards.” Implications for XRP Investors The poll results provide valuable insights into the community’s sentiment and strategy. The overwhelming preference for $100 showcases optimism about XRP’s future, but the variety of exit points reflects different approaches to risk management and profit-taking. Egrag Crypto’s advice serves as a reminder that each investor’s journey is unique, and it’s important to align investment decisions with individual circumstances and goals. Whether aiming for short-term profits or holding out for long-term gains, investors should stay informed and consider the broader market dynamics.

38333006,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53452,1735623033,BNB Mooning After Revolut Listing? Solana Gears Up While Lunex Rockets Into the Game,"As the Bitcoin-led market continues to decline, BNB price is bucking the trend, having recently been listed on Revolut. Meanwhile, SOL is poised for significant gains fueled by the growing interest in its ecosystem. However, the real buzz centers around Lunex Network (LNEX), lauded as one of the fastest-growing cryptos in the current cycle. With its entry into the game, Lunex Network is shaping up to be on strong footing alongside these established giants. This article examines the dynamics behind these assets and their prospects in the current market. Lunex Network Launches DeFi Solutions In One Swoop The difficulty of managing multi-chain portfolios often leaves traders juggling complex tools. Lunex Network’s unified asset tracker changes the game by integrating data from over 40 blockchains into a single dashboard. This innovation simplifies portfolio analysis, helping users make informed decisions without toggling between platforms. Liquidity fragmentation has long plagued decentralized exchanges, but Lunex’s aggregation protocol takes a novel approach. It bridges liquidity gaps across chains, enabling users to access competitive rates effortlessly. By optimizing liquidity pathways, Lunex eliminates inefficiencies that hinder fast and cost-effective trading. Another highlight is its non-custodial wallet, which offers more than just secure storage. This wallet functions as a gateway to decentralized trading and staking, ensuring users retain full control of their funds at all times. Transactions are cryptographically signed by users, reinforcing Lunex’s commitment to decentralization and security. Additionally, regular token burns steadily reduce the supply of $LNEX , creating scarcity while aligning the platform’s growth with long-term value. For traders and investors navigating the volatile crypto market, Lunex provides tools and systems that combine simplicity with powerful functionality. This balance positions it as a formidable force in the market. BNB Price Beats The Odds After Listing on Revolut Binance Coin ( BNB ) has experienced a notable surge following its listing on Revolut, a prominent fintech platform with over 40 million users. This development has increased BNB ‘s accessibility, contributing to its recent price appreciation. BNB is practically the only top 10 crypto with some increase during the ending days of December. The RSI is approaching overbought territory, suggesting strong BNB- buying momentum. The markets are optimistic, with CoinCodex predicting a potential rally above the $800 mark in early 2025. This surge is driven by increased institutional adoption in the US and positive BNB sentiment. SOL Gears Up After For Rally After Bullish Signal Solana ( SOL ) is currently trading around $190, reflecting a slight decline of 6%. Despite this downturn, SOL maintains a strong bullish trend, supported by over 90% of signals from moving averages. With an FGI of 73, SOL continues to trade above its 200-day SMA. The formation of a bull flag pattern on the daily chart suggests the potential for a breakout, with SOL analysts projecting a target of $320 in the near term. However, recent SOL price corrections indicate the possibility of increased volatility. Conclusion Lunex Network is pioneering the future of DeFi one LNEX token at a time. The Lunex Network presale edges closer to listing, with tokens selling for $0.0049 apiece. By staking LNEX tokens for at least 1 month, presale investors can secure up to 18% APY.

38333358,https://cryptonews.com/?p=323598,1735622934,Tether Moves Bitcoin Worth $780M to Reserve in Largest Move Since March,"Tether, the issuer of the world’s most widely used stablecoin, has moved nearly $780 million worth of Bitcoin into its corporate reserve in its largest transaction since March. According to Arkham Intelligence , Tether’s Bitcoin wallets received two separate transfers on December 30, amounting to approximately 8,404.5 BTC. With Bitcoin trading around $92,500, the addition brings Tether’s total holdings to 83,759 BTC, valued at nearly $7.75 billion. Tether Remains Committed to Bitcoin Purchases This move aligns with Tether’s commitment, announced in May 2023, to allocate up to 15% of its net realized operating profits toward Bitcoin purchases. The last significant addition occurred on March 31, when Tether acquired 8,888.88 BTC shortly after Bitcoin surpassed the $70,000 mark. Bitcoin’s price has more than doubled in 2024, reaching an all-time high of $108,000 in mid-December, though it has seen some recent declines. Tether now holds the second-largest Bitcoin reserve among private companies, trailing only Block.one, which owns 140,000 BTC. Overall, Tether ranks third when both private and public companies are considered, behind software giant MicroStrategy, which leads with an impressive 446,400 BTC.

Companies like KULR Technology Group and Quantum BioPharma have recently added Bitcoin to their reserves. KULR’s $21 million purchase of 217.18 BTC on December 16 drove its stock price up over 40%, hitting a record high. Similarly, Quantum BioPharma announced a $1 million investment in Bitcoin and other digital assets to diversify its treasury on December 20. Last week, Tether made its first foray into venture capital by investing $2 million in Arcanum Capital’s Arcanum Emerging Technologies Fund II. The fund is a tokenized investment vehicle focused on supporting decentralized Web3 projects aimed at advancing blockchain-based technologies, including remittances, privacy, and financial inclusion. Furthermore, Tether recently invested $775 million in Rumble , a video-sharing platform known for its free speech ethos. US States Consider Adding Bitcoin To Reserves Ohio has become the latest US state to consider adding Bitcoin to its treasury reserves, following the introduction of a new bill by House Republican leader Derek Merrin. The initiative mirrors recent moves by Texas and Pennsylvania to establish Bitcoin reserves. On 12 December 2024, Texas Representative Giovanni Capriglione introduced the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act, which proposes that the state comptroller hold Bitcoin as a reserve asset for at least five years. Pennsylvania took a similar step in November, with Representative Mike Cabell proposing a bill to allow its treasury to allocate up to 10% of its balance sheet in Bitcoin, citing the asset’s potential to hedge against economic uncertainty. Furthermore, corporate Bitcoin holders like MicroStrategy and Metaplanet have expanded their Bitcoin holdings. MARA Holdings (MARA) has also bought 11,774 BTC in the latest acquisition, the company announced on X on Dec. 10. Likewise, Riot Platforms, a Bitcoin mining company, announced plans to raise $500 million through a private bond offering to bolster its Bitcoin reserves further.

38332919,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=635214,1735622834,Defense industry is anticipating a deal surge as companies expand into AI,"In today’s world, global conflicts are fought part in part using technologically advanced methods. Therefore, a surge in the defense industry can not be ignored. Technology investments such as AI, space systems, and advanced drones will be in high demand in the coming years. According to an analysis by Financial Times, the top 15 defense contractors are expected to generate free cash flow of approximately $50 billion in 2026. This figure is nearly double their combined cash flow at the conclusion of 2021. Michael Sion, partner at Bain & Co consultants said, “Many companies are looking to expand what they offer to get ready for advanced technologies.” He explained that larger companies are expected to pursue fast-growing parts of defense, such as space and defense electronics. In previous years, the war in Ukraine has accelerated the development of new technologies. It is expected to drive dealmaking in the next few years as companies look to expand in fast-growing areas. In addition, the new U.S. administration has recently spoken about not being dependant on China for weapons. With a stance of hiring highly skilled immigrants, the nation is set to create high-tech. VC deals in defense in a decade – Source: Financial Times Notably, a recent report by Bain indicates that the value of venture capital transactions in the defense sector has increased by 18 times over the past decade. An increasing convergence of commercial and defense technologies has helped to promote growth. Here’s why the defense industry is expected to grow In 2023, BAE System announced the acquisition of Ball Aerospace, a US-based supplier of mission-critical space systems, for $5.6 billion. This transaction is among the most recent corporate transactions in the industry. Aerojet Rocketdyne, a manufacturer of rocket engines, was acquired by US defense prime L3Harris in 2022. In addition, AeroVironment, a drone manufacturer, announced in November that it would acquire BlueHalo, a company renowned for its drone swarm. This is to counter-drone technology on an all-share basis for approximately $4.1 billion. Wahid Nawabi, AeroVironment’s chief executive, stated that the company intended to become a “next-generation” prime contractor that would concentrate on “defense technology.” In a recent Financial Times interview, Nawabi said he wanted to create a company that did all the things that the US Department of Defense is focused on and needs. That included unmanned systems, loitering munitions, space communications, electronic warfare, and cyber security. In the same light, Robert Stallard, an analyst at Vertical Research Partners, stated that there was a high probability of activity in the defense technology space, which includes drones, AI, and lasers. However, it was improbable that the large prime contractors would consolidate at the upper end of the sector. Also, Bain’s Sion stated that the defense industry’s modernization requirements presented an opportunity for private capital to assume a more significant role. He stated that private capital can assist in bridging the “funding gap” between the United States’ defense expenditures and its military requirements. Meanwhile, Stallard stated that consolidation and M&A should occur in Europe. Still, joint ventures and teaming are significantly simpler approaches. This is because they enable the Europeans to combine their resources without stirring up politicians over the potential loss of sovereign capability. Nations working towards technology independence In this era, nations that are reliant on external sources for technology and weapons have been striving to develop them independently. This is particularly accurate in the case of large nations with a bad relationship. BRICS and the United States, as well as China and the United States, have been making concerted efforts to reduce their dependence on one another. For status, the US has strived to reduce its dependence on China, even in terms of physical weapons. Last year, the U.S. Navy reduced the number of Chinese suppliers in its “critical technologies” supply chains by 40 percent. In addition, the new administration has come up with a notion. That they could employ highly skilled immigrants instead of kicking all of them out. Musk and Ramaswamy, who have been appointed by Trump to lead his Department of Government Efficiency (D.0.G.E), defended the use of H-1B visas by companies. They contended that technology companies, including those owned by Musk, rely on foreign workers to operate. Chinese spy balloon. Military exercises in the South China Sea. Provocative maneuvers in the Taiwan Strait. China is testing us. We cannot depend on an adversary for our modern way of life. Declare total economic independence from China: the CCP is vulnerable & the time to act is… pic.twitter.com/fnBnqpEi0j — Vivek Ramaswamy (@VivekGRamaswamy) December 7, 2023 Musk wrote on X, “If you want your TEAM to win the championship, you need to recruit top talent wherever they may be. That enables the whole TEAM to win.” Musk has also been operating SpaceX, which manufactures and launches advanced rockets and spacecraft. In addition, China is also looking to reduce the dominance of the American company Nvidia. This is because 90% of the market share is held by GPUs manufactured by Nvidia. Communication technology is the enduring throne that Jensen Huang is on the brink of securing in the AI industry. On December 9, China launched an antitrust investigation into the US chipmaker Nvidia. Also, BRICS nations are preparing for military dominance. Russia has established a weapons program in China to develop and produce long-range attack drones for use in the conflict against Ukraine.

Crypto All-Stars Rallies Following CEX Listing Announcement appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News After raising over $26 million during its presale, Crypto All-Stars (STARS) saw its first DEX listing and an immediate soar from its listing price of $0.001681 to $0.002740, representing a 62% jump just an hour into its launch. The gains were even greater for those who secured their share of the coin during the early rounds of the presale. Over the week, the token’s price fell below its listing level as investors took profit. However, STARS has recorded 30% gains today as its holder count increased following a CEX listing announcement and the second round of its “Last Meme Standing” competition. STARS Sees a 33% Soar Over The Past 48 Hours On December 28th, STARS price dropped to $0.0003315, an all-time low for the coin. However, following the potential CEX listing announcement by STARS’ developers, the token’s holder count increased by over 3,000, and its price shot up to $0.0005954 by December 29th, representing a 79% soar. Although the price of STARS fluctuated to $0.0004291, it has remained up 33% since the CEX listing announcement, with the potential for further gains as more details surface. STARS is currently sitting at an $18 million market cap, which falls into the acceptable range for centralized exchanges that have previously listed low-cap meme coins that immediately delivered impressive returns. For example, Neiro (NEIRO) was just a month old when it had a $14.4 million market cap and scored its Binance listing, which immediately saw its price soar by over 2,500%.

Depending on the exchange that lists it and the market sentiment, STARS could outperform PEPU and SLAP, which saw gains of over 600% and 5,500%, respectively. Last Meme Standing Showcases MemeVault’s Potential As STARS Teases a Second Round Crypto All-Stars is preparing to release the MemeVault, a cross-chain, multi-token staking protocol for meme coins that seeks to unify all meme coin holders under a single roof. Although the STARS team hasn’t confirmed its release date, they’ve hosted a Last Meme Standing competition, which saw investors stake their Pepe, Milady, Shiba Inu, Floki, and Turbo, with a $20,000 worth of STARS on the line for the winning coin’s backers. The competition rules were straightforward – staking a coin places it on top of the leaderboard, and it wins if another coin doesn’t dethrone it before the countdown finishes. The event was a massive success, with over $100,000 worth of meme coins staked, and Pepe’s holders took the prize. Last Meme Standing was such a success its got us thinking…. Round 2 and higher stakes anyone? pic.twitter.com/99iXecMHKW — Crypto All-Stars (@all_stars_coin) December 29, 2024 Besides rewarding the community, Last Meme Standing has showcased the project’s multi-token staking capabilities, which the MemeVault is expected to deliver on release. According to the project’s website, the MemeVault will support 11 tokens once it goes live. The list includes the tokens that appeared in the first Last Meme Standing event and BONK, COQ, BRETT, TOSHI, DOGE, and MOG, which could appear in the second event. STARS Could See Gains of Over 290% if It Keeps Its Momentum With a CEX listing, Last Meme Standing 2, and the MemeVault release in the works, STARS is on track to increase its visibility and potentially return to its listing price, which would represent a 290% surge and could help drive its price further. The bullish sentiment is further bolstered by the project’s steady increase in its follower base, which now numbers over 27,000 users across X (Twitter) and Telegram . Plus, the token is seeing increasing large-volume purchase activity today, with two separate wallet owners buying $13,692 and $10,265 worth of STARS over the past few hours. Regarding investor security, the project enjoys a 99/99 reliability score on DexTools, which confirms there are no critical issues with its smart contract’s code and that no new coins can be minted or wallets blacklisted. Additionally, the project has shared proof of locked liquidity, which ensures a safer trading environment. Liquidity is now LOCKED! Link to proof: https://t.co/EZwZKedHsQ — Crypto All-Stars (@all_stars_coin) December 23, 2024 Although the STARS price fell after delivering solid returns to early investors, the token seems ready for a breakout once MemeVault releases and further details regarding its CEX listing are announced. Thanks to the MemeVault, STARS is designed to be held, as it will act as a reward multiplier within the staking protocol. MemeVault’s release could create scarcity as more meme coin holders add it to their portfolios, which would positively impact its price, making this the best time to purchase and hold it.

Crypto bulls and market participants highly anticipate next year’s run, citing macro factors and increasing institutional appetite. Most users also tip favorable United States catalyst as the biggest driver next year. A new Bitfinex report on the crypto market outlook for 2025 points to a bullish Bitcoin price soaring up to $200,000. The exchange highlights institutional demand as a key metric for price action. This year, institutional flows tapped new highs with the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. So far, these funds have attracted over $37 billion, with mounting prospects in 2025. Per the report, cycle indicators like the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV), and Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) show the bull cycle is still on. However, like previous cycles, giant peaks may not be expected in the short term. Still, bulls expect a reasonable jump in price next year between $150k to $200k. The exchange cites a minimum price estimate of $145,000 in June which could extend to $200,000 on the back of favorable conditions. Market Expects a Post-Halving Year Rally Traditionally, BTC prices have surged after each halving, with significant gains recorded for the next year. This bull case scenario in Q1 2024, ahead of the halving, led to miners repositioning holdings. Next year, market participants expect the effect to swing alongside tightening global financial conditions fully. Furthermore, inflationary trends are expected to attract more users to Bitcoin as a store of value to protect assets. This has been a recurring macro trend in the past 12 months. “ Inflation remains a central focus, with core CPI steady at 3.3% YoY reflecting persistent pressure in vehicle prices and durable goods. The Fed’s restrictive stance, despite planned rate cuts, underscores the difficulty in achieving its 2% inflation target. Strong economic growth, including a projected 3.8% Q4 annualized rate, supports cautious monetary easing but leaves room for recalibration should inflation persist.” Finally, the market expects positive crypto laws in the United States to shape the global sentiment. This is expected to attract more institutional investors, taking BTC prices to new all-time highs. The price of the crypto leader soared past $107K before slight corrections due to volatility. Similarly, whales have recorded large accumulations signaling long-term holdings.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | SPONSORED | TRADING,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/the-bull-run-continues-bitfinex-projects-200000-bitcoin-price-in-2025/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

This follows recent bullish price projections above $250 as traders align for positive movement next year. More institutional investors have rolled out Solana products with expectations of spot SOL ETF approvals in the United States. Crypto asset manager Bitwise has launched a Solana Staking Exchange Traded Product (ETP), adding to its growing list of institutional solutions.

Trading under the ticker BSOL, the product will give more rewards than previous options, going as high as 6.4%. Staking has become popular among institutional investors in search of more gains in the ecosystem. This year, several traditional investors tipped Ethereum for having the most potential due to its staking features. “ Bitwise today announced the listing of its new Bitwise Solana Staking ETP (Ticker: BSOL, ISIN: DE000A4A59D2) on Xetra, providing institutional-grade total return exposure to Solana’s native cryptocurrency, SOL. With an innovative staking mechanism engineered to deliver significantly higher rewards compared to other Solana staking ETPs, BSOL reaffirms Bitwise’s position as a leader in the fast-growing crypto asset market.” Bitwise Set Sights On Expansion According to the release, BSOL offers low-cost ownership and high staking returns. While it offers 6,48%, 21Shares, its EU competitor, gives 5.49%. The product also has a management fee lower than the competition. Its fees stand at 0.85%, while others are slightly higher. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley highlighted the company’s vision to expand its products for more opportunities in the crypto market. This is the company’s third staking ETP this year, with previous Ethereum and Aptos products launched in February and November. Bitwise has seen significant success growth with over $12 billion in assets as institutional investors pour into the space. Meanwhile, all eyes have turned to anticipated Solana ETFs in the United States. Solana’s price projection continues above old levels with more adoption and whale accumulations.

38332240,https://zycrypto.com/?p=99568,1735621694,Hayes Warns of “Vicious” Crypto Market Sell-Off Looming in 2025,"BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes believes that the inauguration of US President-Elect Donald Trump will cause a “vicious sell-off” across the cryptocurrency market. In an article dubbed “ Trump Truth,” Hayes outlined his bearish outlook, saying that the crypto market had high expectations about the Trump Presidency. However, the administration would likely not enact policies as quickly as the market anticipated. “The market will instantly wake up to the reality that Trump has at best one year to enact any policy changes on or around January 20th. This realization will lead to a vicious sell-off in crypto and other Trump 2.0 equity trades,” Hayes stated. According to the analyst, the US political landscape could also curtail the speed at which the Trump administration fulfills its campaign promises. This is because if Republicans fail to maintain the majority during the 2026 mid-term elections, it could cripple the efforts of the Trump administration. Past policies might hinder change Hayes also noted that the US administration was still dealing with the effects of poor monetary policies. Therefore, if friendly crypto policies fail to come into effect as fast as the market anticipates, traders could begin to dump. Furthermore, the issues that led to Trump and the Republican party getting overwhelming support during the November 5 elections were still in play and could not be solved immediately. “I don’t believe the markets realize how little time Trump actually has to accomplish anything,” he added. “The issues that gave rise to Trump’s popularity are decades in the making. As such, there are no immediate solutions regardless of what Elon Musk tells you on X.” Due to these factors, Hayes believes the market will dump around the inauguration on January 20. However, if the market continues to rally beyond this date, this bearish thesis will be defeated, and the current bull market will extend. Plans for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve While speaking during the 2024 Bitcoin conference earlier this year, Trump announced plans to set up a strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis has also proposed a bill to set up this reserve. Hayes has opined that it is unlikely that the US will directly purchase Bitcoin. However, if these purchases were to happen, it could bode well for BTC’s fiat price. “If the US government creates more dollars via a gold devaluation and uses some of those dollars to buy Bitcoin, its fiat price will rise. This will in turn spur competitive sovereign purchases by other nations who have to play catchup with the US,” he added.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/hayes-warns-of-vicious-crypto-market-sell-off-looming-in-2025/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

MSTR bought its Bitcoin before the trading day began on the Nasdaq stock exchange. One hour after the trading day was opened, its shares dropped 5.3% from $318.89 to $302.09. At the close of the trading day, the company had recovered and was trading at $302.96, according to Google Finance data . Yet, it fell again with 3.19% during the after-hours trading, causing the price to drop to $293.59. Source: Google Finance MicroStrategy’s plan to raise its number of authorized shares is growing concerns MicroStrategy has been purchasing Bitcoin for eight consecutive weeks since October 31. During this period, the firm added 194,180 BTC to its Bitcoin reserve, which currently stands at 2,093,180 BTC. In its latest filing, the company said it sold up to 592,987 shares to raise funds for Bitcoin purchases. In a December 30 X post, the Kobeissi Letter shared that the market was uneasy with this move. MicroStrategy has also borrowed much money from convertible notes and debt issuances, explains Kobeissi. The company may need to borrow more money or issue even more shares to keep buying Bitcoin. If the proposal is approved, the total number of shares could rise from 330 million to 10.33 billion. This situation is difficult for the company, with risks on both sides. MicroStrategy bought less Bitcoin as stock dipped Although MicroStrategy has sustained its Bitcoin acquisition strategy, it has recently resorted to buying fewer Bitcoins than in earlier days. During its securities filing last week, the company clarified that it purchased $561 million worth of Bitcoin, a drop from $1.5 billion the week before. The drop is louder than December 9 when it bought $2.1 billion worth of Bitcoin. There is no clarity on why the weekly purchase is systematically declining, with some speculating that it is becoming expensive to purchase Bitcoins when the price levels are historically high. However, the most worrying concern for investors could be whether MicroStrategy is becoming less bullish on crypto, given that despite Bitcoin’s price growing, its shares are experiencing a dip.

Here’s What Experts Say,"Ethereum (ETH) – the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization – may finally seize its moment in Q1 2025. Crypto experts have taken to X to share their analyses of a potentially bullish start to the new year for ETH. Ethereum Bullish Price Action In Q1 2025? Although Ethereum is up by almost 43% on a year-to-date (YTD) basis, its performance pales in comparison to Bitcoin (BTC) which has appreciated by more than 115% in the same period. In addition, various alternative Layer-1 blockchains, such as Solana (SOL) and SUI have vastly outperformed ETH throughout 2024. Related Reading: Ethereum Spot ETFs Witness Unbroken 16-Day Inflow Streak: New ETH ATH Soon? However, the momentum may soon shift in ETH’s favor, as experts suggest that Q1 2025 could mark a bullish phase for the world’s leading smart contract platform. According to crypto analyst Crypto Bullet, ETH appears to be forming a bullish pennant on the daily chart, with a potential breakout to $6,000 expected by March 2025. Similarly, cryptocurrency expert Anup Dhungana highlighted another bullish pattern forming on the weekly chart. He pointed to an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern – a widely recognized bullish indicator that suggests an impending price surge. Based on Dhungana’s analysis, ETH could soar to as high as $8,000 by May 2025. However, he also warned that the digital asset may first experience a dip to $2,800 before reaching new all-time highs (ATH). Veteran crypto analyst Quinten Francois also shared an interesting perspective. He noted that ETH has historically recorded exceptional gains during Q1 of the year following a US presidential election. If this historical pattern holds, Q1 2025 could be extraordinarily bullish for Ethereum. ETH Staking To Create Supply Crunch? In addition, Galaxy Research shared some price predictions about Ethereum heading into 2025, saying that the digital asset will trade above $5,500 in 2025 due to potentially favorable regulations surrounding staking and decentralized finance (DeFi). Related Reading: Ethereum Jumps 10% As DeFi Sentiment Rebounds With Trump’s Victory Galaxy Research also projected that Ethereum’s staking rate will surpass 50%, creating a supply crunch that could trigger a sharp price increase. The firm explained: The Trump administration is likely to offer greater regulatory clarity and guidance for the crypto industry in the U.S. Among other outcomes, it is likely that spot-based ETH ETPs will be allowed to stake some percentage of the ETH they hold on behalf of shareholders. Demand for staking will continue to rise next year, and likely exceed half of Ethereum circulating supply by the end of 2025, which will prompt Ethereum developers to more seriously consider changes to network monetary policy. Additionally, Galaxy Research suggested that the ETH/BTC trading pair will close 2025 trading above 0.06, buoyed by anticipated regulatory tailwinds. A rise in this trading pair from its current lows of approximately 0.03 could serve as a catalyst for the much-awaited altseason. Recent analysis by crypto analyst Carl Runefelt also foresees a big move for ETH at the beginning of the new year. At press time, ETH trades at $3,345, down 0.7% in the past 24 hours.

Judge Alvin Hellerstein announced on December 30 that the trial will now start on January 21, emphasizing that “no further adjournments will be granted.” The six-day delay pushes the trial into the new presidential administration, with President-elect Donald Trump set to take office on January 20. Delay Could Benefit Crypto Firms The shift could have implications for the CFTC’s stance on Gemini and other cryptocurrency firms, as regulatory priorities may evolve under new leadership. Judge Hellerstein did not provide specific reasons for the date change. The case, filed in June 2022, accuses Gemini of providing false or misleading information to the CFTC regarding its 2017 bid to offer Bitcoin futures contracts. The commission is seeking financial penalties, the disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, and other measures to prevent future violations of the Commodity Exchange Act. The trial’s timing coincides with heightened discussions in Washington about cryptocurrency regulation. A new Congress convenes on January 3, and pending legislation could further define the roles of the CFTC and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in overseeing the crypto industry. Crypto in the court, more trial date movements, in CFTC v. Gemini Trust Company, the trial previously scheduled to begin on Jan 13, 2025 is hereby adjourned to Jan 21, no further adjournments will be granted. Inner City Press on the case(s) pic.twitter.com/TzEWE8tnZW — Inner City Press (@innercitypress) December 30, 2024 The CFTC’s current chairman, Rostin Behnam, whose term ends in 2026, could face replacement under the Trump administration, potentially influencing the regulator’s approach to crypto enforcement. The CFTC has been active in pursuing crypto firms for alleged violations, including actions against FTX, Celsius, and Binance. In its 2024 fiscal report, the agency disclosed over $17 billion in monetary recoveries, largely from enforcement efforts targeting cryptocurrency companies. Gemini Gains Preliminary Approval From Singapore Regulator In October, Gemini secured in-principle approval from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the country’s financial regulator. The preliminary nod allows Gemini to offer cross-border money transfer and digital payment token services. “While the US remains our largest market and global headquarters, Asia and Singapore in particular play a crucial role in our global strategy,” Saad Ahmed, who oversees Gemini’s operations in the Asia-Pacific region, said. With a footprint in around 70 countries, Singapore stands out as Gemini’s second-largest market by customer base. It trails only the US. The expansion efforts come as regulatory pressures have intensified in the domestic market. Ahmed said that Singapore is important in Gemini’s regional ambitions, noting that the city-state will serve as the company’s Asia-Pacific hub. “We are building the required capabilities here to drive operations across the region,” he added. In 2022, the Singapore regulator said that Gemini Trust Company had an exemption from licensing . At the same time, Genesis Asia Pacific, a subsidiary of Genesis Group, was granted an in-principle approval to offer DPT. Furthermore, Gemini was awarded a crypto license by the French watchdog Autorite des marches financiers in January.

38333005,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53495,1735620917,EU MICAr and Tether (USDT) Delisting: What Every Crypto Trader Needs to Know,"Mike Williams, a prominent cryptocurrency trader and enthusiast, recently shared a detailed thread discussing the implications of the EU’s upcoming Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MICAr). This regulatory framework, which took effect on December 30, 2024, has profound implications for the cryptocurrency ecosystem in Europe and potentially beyond. Here, we analyze Williams’ claims, provide context, and assess his suggested solutions. What is MICAr? MICAr is the European Union’s comprehensive regulation governing cryptocurrency markets. The regulation establishes a licensing regime for cryptocurrency businesses and introduces stringent Know Your Customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) requirements. It is part of the EU’s broader effort to provide clear legal frameworks for digital assets, ensuring transparency, consumer protection, and market integrity. Key provisions include: Travel Rule Compliance: Cryptocurrency businesses must collect and share identifying information about both the sender and recipient of all transactions, regardless of their size. Universal Wallet KYC: Both hot and cold wallets will require identity verification, providing authorities with complete visibility into user transactions. Stablecoin Delisting: Certain stablecoins, including USDT , will be delisted from many EU exchanges, likely due to non-compliance with regulatory standards. Implications for Crypto Users Williams emphasizes the far-reaching consequences of MICAr, particularly its impact on user privacy and the foundational principles of cryptocurrency. The mandatory sharing of personal data across exchanges raises significant concerns about data security, as centralized data pools become increasingly vulnerable to leaks and misuse. Additionally, the requirement to link identities to non-custodial wallets undermines the decentralized and private financial control that cryptocurrency was designed to offer. Furthermore, the delisting of USDT introduces the risk of disrupting trading and liquidity for European users, effectively steering them toward compliant alternatives like USDC . Williams also criticizes the narrative driving these regulations, arguing that they serve traditional financial institutions by discouraging decentralized alternatives. He claims that offline wallets do not inherently increase risks of criminal activity, as they lack fiat on-ramps, making these measures excessive and invasive. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Workarounds and Recommendations Williams suggests practical solutions for users to maintain control over their assets: Non-KYC Exchanges: Moving funds to non-KYC platforms like Toobit can help users avoid the new regulatory restrictions. However, users should exercise caution when using lesser-known platforms to ensure security and compliance with applicable laws. Offline Wallets: Utilizing fresh, unlinked cold wallets gives users more control over their privacy, although this may require additional steps to manage funds effectively. Mike Williams’ insights underscore the transformative and controversial nature of MICAr. While the regulation aims to bring transparency and accountability to the crypto industry, it also raises legitimate concerns about privacy, data security, and user autonomy. As the regulatory landscape evolves, crypto users must stay informed, adapt their strategies, and carefully consider how best to safeguard their assets and privacy. For now, Williams’ thread serves as both a wake-up call and a guide for those navigating the shifting tides of cryptocurrency regulation in Europe and beyond.

38331436,https://coinpaper.com/6750/cftc-vs-gemini-trial-delayed-amid-changing-political-landscape,1735619982,CFTC vs. Gemini Trial Delayed Amid Changing Political Landscape,"A New York judge has delayed the high-profile trial between the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and Gemini Trust Company, a case that could redefine the regulatory approach to digital assets under the incoming presidential administration. Meanwhile, in Europe, MoonPay has become one of the first crypto firms to secure a license under the European Union’s landmark Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework, signaling a new era of regulatory clarity and compliance for crypto businesses operating in the bloc. New York Judge Delays CFTC v. Gemini Trial, Raising Stakes Amid Political Transition A New York judge has postponed the start of the civil trial between the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and Gemini Trust Company. Initially set for Jan. 13, 2025, the trial will now commence on Jan. 21, according to a Dec. 30 filing in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York. Judge Alvin Hellerstein emphasized that “no further adjournments will be granted.” The decision places the trial’s opening under the administration of President-elect Donald Trump, raising questions about potential shifts in regulatory attitudes toward the crypto industry. The case, filed in June 2022, centers on allegations that Gemini provided false or misleading statements to the CFTC during its 2017 bid to launch Bitcoin futures contracts. The CFTC has accused Gemini of violating the Commodity Exchange Act and has sought substantial penalties, including disgorgement of alleged ill-gotten gains, civil monetary fines, and injunctive measures to prevent further violations. This trial represents a pivotal moment for the CFTC’s enforcement strategy in the crypto space. Over the past year, the agency has aggressively targeted major players in the industry, securing over $17 billion in monetary relief during the 2024 fiscal year, primarily through enforcement actions against firms like FTX, Celsius, and Binance. Judge Hellerstein provided no specific rationale for the six-day delay, though its timing aligns with two significant political events: the inauguration of President-elect Trump on Jan. 20 and the start of the new session of Congress on Jan. 3. Both developments could influence the regulatory and legislative landscape surrounding the crypto industry. The shift in presidential administrations brings the potential for a change in tone at the CFTC. Current Chairman Rostin Behnam, appointed during President Biden’s tenure, is expected to serve until June 2026. However, reports suggest that Trump may consider replacing Behnam with a more crypto-friendly appointee. Such a move could significantly impact not only the CFTC’s approach to the Gemini case but also the broader regulatory framework for digital assets. The CFTC, alongside the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has been at the forefront of crypto regulation in the United States. While the SEC has focused on defining digital assets as securities, the CFTC has asserted jurisdiction over commodities, including Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The outcome of the Gemini trial could set a critical precedent for how regulators enforce compliance in the nascent crypto industry. Additionally, Congress may play a key role in clarifying the respective roles of the SEC and CFTC through proposed legislation. Such clarity could empower the CFTC to expand its influence, especially if Trump’s administration adopts a more favorable stance toward crypto innovation. What’s at Stake for Gemini? For Gemini , founded by the Winklevoss twins, the stakes are high. The exchange has positioned itself as a trusted player in the crypto market, emphasizing regulatory compliance and user security. A loss in court could result in substantial financial penalties and reputational damage, undermining its efforts to distinguish itself in a highly competitive industry. However, a favorable outcome could bolster Gemini’s standing as a compliant and innovative platform, potentially paving the way for broader adoption of its services, including Bitcoin futures contracts. The delay of the CFTC v. Gemini trial adds another layer of complexity to an already intricate legal and regulatory landscape. With Trump’s administration poised to take office, industry observers will be closely monitoring whether his appointments and policies signal a shift toward a more accommodating environment for crypto firms. The trial’s outcome could reverberate across the industry, influencing the strategies of both regulators and market participants. As the US grapples with how to balance innovation with consumer protection, the case shows the importance of clear and consistent regulatory frameworks for digital assets. The postponement of the CFTC v. Gemini trial sheds light on the interplay between legal proceedings, regulatory oversight, and political dynamics in shaping the future of the cryptocurrency industry. With billions of dollars and the industry’s credibility at stake, all eyes will be on the courtroom come Jan. 21, as the trial unfolds against the backdrop of a new presidential administration and potentially shifting regulatory priorities. MoonPay Secures MiCA License in the Netherlands: A Major Milestone for Crypto Regulation in the EU MoonPay, a leading provider of crypto payment solutions, has announced a significant regulatory milestone: the company has been approved to operate as a licensed cryptocurrency business in the Netherlands under the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulatory framework. The announcement, made on Dec. 30, marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of crypto regulation within the EU. In its Dec. 30 statement, MoonPay revealed that the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets had granted the firm a license in accordance with MiCA regulations. With this approval, MoonPay will continue to provide fiat-to-crypto on-ramps and crypto-to-fiat off-ramps, reinforcing its role as a critical infrastructure provider for the crypto ecosystem. Ivan Soto-Wright, co-founder and CEO of MoonPay, celebrated the development as a “pivotal step in solidifying the crypto industry’s role in the global economy.” The approval positions MoonPay as one of the first crypto firms to operate under the MiCA framework, setting a precedent for other companies navigating the complex regulatory environment. MiCA: Transforming the EU’s Crypto Landscape The European Union’s MiCA framework represents one of the most comprehensive regulatory efforts globally to address the crypto industry. First adopted in 2023, MiCA aims to harmonize regulations across the EU’s member states, providing a unified framework for crypto asset service providers (CASPs). Dec. 30 marked the end of MiCA’s implementation phase, ushering in an 18-month transitional period. During this transitional phase, companies already compliant with existing local regulations may continue operating while awaiting their MiCA licenses. These ”grandfathered” firms can maintain operations until July 2026 or until national authorities make final decisions regarding their licenses. MiCA’s regulatory scope includes provisions for stablecoins, asset-backed tokens, and crypto service providers. As of June 2024, stablecoins have been under scrutiny, leading some exchanges to delist Tether’s USDT in response to compliance requirements. MoonPay’s license approval signals the growing maturity of the cryptocurrency industry and its integration into traditional financial systems. By obtaining a MiCA license, MoonPay strengthens its foothold in the European market, building trust with users and regulators alike. The license not only ensures compliance but also opens doors for MoonPay to expand its offerings. The company has already gained prominence for its fiat-to-crypto infrastructure, partnering with major players like PayPal to provide seamless services to users in the US, UK, and EU. Reports of MoonPay’s discussions to acquire Helio Pay for $150 million further highlight its ambitions to scale operations and diversify its service portfolio. This move could potentially enhance MoonPay’s position as a leading provider of crypto payment solutions globally. The introduction of MiCA signals a new era for cryptocurrency regulation in the European Union. By establishing clear and consistent rules, the framework aims to foster innovation while protecting consumers and ensuring market stability. MiCA’s impact is already evident. Stablecoin issuers and exchanges have had to adjust to its requirements, while firms like MoonPay are leveraging the framework to demonstrate compliance and build legitimacy. The transitional period until mid-2026 offers a window of opportunity for companies to adapt, but it also places pressure on regulators and businesses to align with the new standards. MoonPay’s achievement in obtaining a MiCA license suggests there is an increasing globalization of crypto regulations. As jurisdictions like the EU take the lead in establishing comprehensive frameworks, other regions may look to MiCA as a model for balancing innovation with regulatory oversight. The regulatory clarity provided by MiCA could encourage more institutional participation in the crypto market, as firms gain confidence in a well-regulated environment. For MoonPay, this represents not just a regulatory victory but also a strategic advantage as the firm continues to expand its services and partnerships. MoonPay’s MiCA approval in the Netherlands marks a significant milestone for both the company and the broader cryptocurrency industry. As the EU embarks on its transitional phase under MiCA, the framework’s success could serve as a blueprint for global crypto regulation. For MoonPay, the license solidifies its position as a key player in the European crypto market and sets the stage for future growth. As the regulatory landscape continues to evolve, MoonPay’s proactive approach to compliance could position it as a leader in driving innovation and trust in the crypto space.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6750/cftc-vs-gemini-trial-delayed-amid-changing-political-landscape,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

Trump the Grinch (TRUMPGRI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPGRI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump the Grinch can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump the Grinch could become the next viral memecoin. Trump the Grinch launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump the Grinch on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump the Grinch by entering its contract address – 93BLFCVkzBwnSUUjiyaVRQSpjEvaXdZe3oS3iyHnhind – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPGRI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trump-the-grinch-trumpgri-solana-memecoin-to-skyrocket-19000-before-exchange-listings-as-shiba-inu-and-doge-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png
38331331,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=376703,1735619695,Hong Kong Lawmaker Proposes Incorporating BTC Into Region’s Fiscal Reserves,"Hong Kong may soon join the list of countries leveraging bitcoin (BTC) as a store of value and a hedge against inflation by establishing the cryptocurrency as a fiscal reserve asset. According to a report from local media, Wen Wei Po, Wu Jiexhuang, a member of the Hong Kong legislative council, has proposed incorporating BTC into the region’s fiscal reserves to enhance financial security. He said Hong Kong could use foreign exchange funds to acquire and hold BTC in the long term. BTC as Reserve Asset in Hong Kong Jiexhuang told Wen Wei Po that adding BTC to Hong Kong’s fiscal reserves could encourage the development of the local crypto industry, attract talent and investment, and increase transaction stamp tax revenue. Taking advantage of China’s one country, two systems policy, including BTC in Hong Kong’s reserves, could offer the region a first-mover advantage and help authorities reduce economic disruptions caused by broader adoption of the asset in traditional markets. “If major economic powers take the initiative to include Bitcoin in strategic reserves, the value of Bitcoin will be more stable, causing more and more other countries to follow suit and reduce their holdings of traditional assets. This will result in the fall of the price of traditional assets and will shrink the government’s fiscal reserves holding traditional assets,” Jiexhuang said. While the politician noted the benefits of buying and holding BTC, he also noted the risks associated with investing in the asset. He advised Hong Kong authorities to allocate a small percentage of the national reserves to the asset, starting with Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). He urged the government to study the impact of the United States’ spot Bitcoin ETF market on the country’s finance industry and act accordingly. Notably, Hong Kong already has a spot Bitcoin ETF market; however, its inflows are pale in comparison to U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs. Following Trump’s Steps Jiexhuang is not the first lawmaker to propose including BTC in Hong Kong’s reserves; another legislative council member, Johnny Ng, did the same in July 2024. Ng’s suggestion followed U.S. President Donald Trump’s vow to create a national Bitcoin reserve at the Bitcoin Conference in Nashville earlier this year. Both politicians believe Trump’s proposal to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve for the United States could have a major impact on traditional markets and insist Hong Kong could be positioned as a financial hub promoting such technological advancements. Meanwhile, lawmakers in Germany are also proposing the adoption of BTC as the country’s reserve asset.

A tweet from the WallStreetBets community captured the debate surrounding XRP’s recent performance and potential trajectory. The tweet stated , “XRP just pulled a 250% glow-up, eyeing $8 if crypto hits $5T.” This optimistic prediction elicited mixed responses from the crypto community, highlighting both bullish enthusiasm and skepticism. $XRP just pulled a 250% glow-up, eyeing $8 if crypto hits $5T — wallstreetbets (@wallstreetbets) December 27, 2024 Current State of XRP At the time of the tweet, XRP was trading at $2.19, reflecting a significant $0.86 increase in the last 24 hours. While the gain is notable, it falls short of the 250% growth suggested in the tweet. To achieve a 250% increase, XRP has to rise from approximately $2.19 to $7.66—a scenario that has not occurred within this recent cycle. The discrepancy between the actual performance and the claim underscores the importance of fact-checking in the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency speculation. Crypto Community Reactions The responses to the WallStreetBets tweet provide insight into the diverse perspectives within the crypto space. Silence Dogood, a responder, outright dismissed the notion of XRP reaching $8 soon. They wrote , “No it’s not… at all. It’ll never hit 8. Not this cycle or the next.” This reflects a sentiment shared by many who view XRP’s growth potential as limited due to its historical performance and market dynamics. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Another user, Mr. NTWEK, responded with humor, stating, “Nice! Thanks for the laugh.” Such comments highlight the skepticism and often playful nature of discussions within the cryptocurrency community, particularly regarding bold predictions. A user named Amer provided a more grounded perspective, noting , “No it did not. It’s currently at $2.19. Nowhere near its all-time high and has largely been a poor performer unless you invested back in November.” This response emphasizes XRP’s performance in the broader context of its historical price trends and market cycles. XRP Path to $8 For XRP to reach $8, it would require a substantial shift in market dynamics, including an overall crypto market capitalization of $5 trillion, as suggested in the original tweet. While the global crypto market has experienced rapid growth, reaching $5 trillion would depend on widespread adoption, regulatory clarity, and continued innovation in blockchain technologies. Historically, XRP’s price has been influenced by market sentiment, legal challenges its affiliated company faces, and its utility as a digital asset. Although XRP has seen considerable adoption in cross-border payments, its performance has often lagged behind other major cryptocurrencies, limiting its appeal to some investors.

MicroStrategy announced the acquisition just an hour before Nasdaq trading began at 2:30 pm UTC. Within the first hour, its shares dropped 5.3%, falling from $318.89 to $302.09. While partially recovering during the session to close at $302.96, the stock declined another 3.19% in after-hours trading, settling at $293.59, according to Google Finance data. Bitcoin Purchases and Stock Dilution MicroStrategy funded the Bitcoin acquisition by selling 592,987 shares earlier that week, according to a regulatory filing. This marked the eighth consecutive week the company bought Bitcoin, adding 194,180 BTC to its holdings since Oct. 31. Concerns are growing about the company’s financial strategy, with The Kobeissi Letter noting in a Dec. 30 post on X that MicroStrategy’s plan to increase authorized shares by $10 billion has raised alarms. The firm’s heavy reliance on convertible notes and debt issuances leaves it needing to issue more debt or equity to sustain its Bitcoin buying spree. “The problem is, it has left the company in a ‘lose-lose’ situation for now,” Kobeissi added. Market Reactions and Predictions Despite a 20.18% decline in MSTR’s price over the past 30 days, the stock remains up 342.15% since Jan. 1. Hartmann Capital founder Felix Hartmann suggested in a Dec. 30 post that MicroStrategy’s stock could “eventually implode,” though he acknowledged the possibility of significant short-term gains. Unchained head of market research Joe Burnett described the company’s strategy as “hyperbitcoinization,” highlighting its use of leverage to grow Bitcoin-per-share.

38331433,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53459,1735617645,"XRP Price Could Fall Below $0.50 By Q1 2025, Smart Money Pivots to an Altcoin Predicted to Rise 19,208%","The XRP price has faced turbulent times recently, with analysts predicting its price could slip below $0.50 by Q1 2025. As market uncertainty grips Ripple’s token, experienced investors are redirecting their focus toward emerging opportunities like PCHAIN . PropiChain is an AI-powered altcoin set to disrupt the real estate industry. With a 19,208% growth forecast, PropiChain is quickly becoming the talk of the crypto world, offering a beacon of hope amid the XRP price struggles. XRP Price Analysis: Is $0.50 Inevitable, and Why Smart Money Is Diversifying The XRP price has been on a rollercoaster ride recently, leaving investors questioning its next move. After holding steady in the key support range of $2.40 to $2.20, XRP is showing signs of fragility. While minor price reactions suggested potential for recovery, the lack of a robust upward push has sparked concerns about a steeper decline. If XRP breaks below its current support levels, it could signal a slide toward uncharted territories below $0.50 by Q1 2025. On the other hand, smart money appears to be looking elsewhere for better returns. Investors are seeking promising opportunities in emerging altcoins like PropiChain , which offers a revolutionary blend of blockchain and real-world applications. With the XRP price showing limited short-term growth potential, diversification into innovative projects seems like a logical strategy for these investors. PropiChain: The Altcoin Redefining Real Estate Investments with Blockchain In a market dominated by speculative tokens, PropiChain stands out as a real-world solution with the potential for explosive growth. By seamlessly integrating blockchain technology with the trillion-dollar real estate industry, PropiChain is pioneering a new investment frontier. One of its standout features is real estate tokenization. PropiChain enables fractional ownership, allowing investors to purchase tokens representing real estate assets. This makes high-value properties accessible to everyday investors, democratizing an industry traditionally reserved for the wealthy. Another game-changing feature is its AI-driven analytics, which provide data-backed insights to investors. PropiChain’s AI tools empower users with actionable intelligence by predicting market trends and identifying lucrative real estate opportunities, enhancing decision-making and ROI potential. Another unique offering is PropiChain’s integration with the metaverse, where investors can explore virtual replicas of properties. This immersive experience adds a futuristic touch to real estate investing, offering a clear picture of assets before committing funds. PropiChain also uses smart contracts to automate leasing, rental payments, and renewals. This eliminates traditional inefficiencies and minimizes risks associated with manual processes. Additionally, its blockchain-based security safeguards against fraud, ensuring transparent and tamper-proof transactions. This is as practical as possible. For instance, if you have $1,000 to spare. With PropiChain, you can purchase fractional tokens of a high-demand property, earn rental income, and benefit from property value appreciation. PropiChain Presale: The Golden Opportunity for Early Adopters PropiChain’s presale is generating momentum. The presale’s first stage raised over $1 million, and the Stage 2 is now live. At a current price of just $0.011 per token, early investors have the chance to secure a position before its anticipated 19,208% growth. The roadmap outlines a price increase to $0.023 in Stage 3, making now the perfect time to enter. For instance, an investor putting in $1,000 today could potentially see their investment grow exponentially as PropiChain hits mainstream adoption. Compared to the XRP price, which has a more limited upside due to its maturity and established status, PropiChain offers unparalleled growth potential. If PropiChain tokens rise to their projected value by Q1 2025, an early investment of $500 could grow into $96,040. Conclusion As the XRP price grapples with market challenges, the appeal of emerging projects like PropiChain is hard to ignore. XRP’s potential decline below $0.50 by Q1 2025 has made it clear that diversification is essential for investors looking to secure substantial returns. The time to act is now. Don’t miss your chance to be part of PropiChain’s journey to revolutionize real estate investment while enjoying the potential for life-changing returns. As the XRP price faces headwinds, smart money is moving into PropiChain, and so should you For more information about the PropiChain Presale: Website: http://propichain.finance/ Join Community: https://linktr.ee/propichain Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release for informational purposes only.

38330046,https://square.htx.com/?p=42272,1735616674,Launch of the HTX DAO Forum: A New Dawn for Exchange Governance,"In December 2024, HTX DAO announced the official launch of its governance forum, ushering in a new era of innovation for global crypto community governance. This move represents more than just a new feature; it also marked a historic step for exchanges, transitioning from traditional centralized management towards decentralized autonomous governance model. *Forum Link: https://htxdao.discourse.group/ The Significance and Features of the HTX DAO Forum The forum serves as a vital bridge between community members and the decentralized governance structure. Key functions include: 1. Platform for Proposals and Discussions: The forum provides a public platform for users to submit governance proposals and engage in discussions. 2. Transparent Governance Mechanisms: By keeping a record of all proposals and discussions, the forum ensures a fully transparent governance process. Users can review the context and rationale behind every decision to ensure fair governance. 3. Development of HTX Improvement Proposals (HIPs): The forum acts as the breeding ground for proposal drafts. This is where users exchange ideas, build consensus, and refine proposals before they are put to the vote. In short, the HTX DAO Forum is the central hub of the decentralized governance ecosystem, seamlessly integrating users with the governance system. This fosters a transparent, efficient, and user-driven environment for HTX DAO’s growth. HTX DAO Reshapes the Relationship Between Exchange and Users The HTX DAO Forum is more than just a tool; it marks a paradigm shift in the relationship between the HTX exchange and its users. By granting decision-making power to $HTX token holders, the platform transitions from a pure financial service provider to a collaborative community governed hub. Exchange governance evolves from a one-way service model to collaborative participation, where user proposals and needs are embedded into the platform’s operations. This shift from a “service provider” to a “co-governor” repositions the exchange as a genuine Web3 organization, which leverages decentralized technology to build an open, transparent, and community-driven ecosystem. Unlike traditional institutions, Web3 prioritizes user autonomy, collective decision-making, and equitable sharing, allowing every participant to share in the ecosystem’s growth. This represents the nascent stage of a crypto finance hub in the metaverse, a future financial ecosystem belonging solely to the crypto ecosystem. Diverse Possibilities for Exchange Governance The launch of the HTX DAO Forum opens doors for community collaboration and multifaceted innovation. From proposing governance initiatives to steering ecosystem development, every user can play a pivotal role. This bottom-up approach will unleash the community’s collective wisdom and creativity. Potential Application Extensions 1. Ecosystem Incubator : Forum members can initiate proposals for new project incubation, such as launching a meme coin mining campaign on a specific blockchain or developing a feature deeply integrated with GameFi. Once approved through community voting, HTX DAO can provide startup capital or technical support for these projects. 2. Inter-Community Collaboration : The HTX DAO Forum can serve as a bridge for collaboration beyond the HTX ecosystem. For instance, it can facilitate joint proposals among various DAOs to tackle industry challenges or develop innovative financial tools. 3. Public Welfare and Social Responsibility : HTX DAO community members can propose allocating a portion of trading fees to blockchain education or environmental protection projects. These philanthropic initiatives not only improve the platform’s social image but also allow users to feel a sense of involvement. Envisioning the Future of Crypto Exchanges The launch of the HTX DAO Forum marks just the beginning of a new era of exchange governance. Here’s a glimpse into how HTX DAO will evolve: 1. Feature Optimization and Expansion : More governance modules will be introduced, such as smart proposal screening, real-time community feedback, on-chain decision visualization tools, and a more democratic token-based voting mechanism, to enhance user experience. 2. Ecosystem Development : HTX DAO is rooted in the exchange and built upon future ecosystem players like TRON and HTX. With highly scalable businesses, the ecosystem will gradually explore more utility-driven services. 3. Global Community Expansion : It actively attracts users from various cultures and regions, offering multilingual support and fostering an environment conducive to cross-regional collaboration. Through these initiatives, the exchange will gradually transition from a traditional financial intermediary to a digital economic ecosystem where users jointly govern and share in benefits. Possible Future Scenarios: 1. A Fully Autonomous Exchange : In the future, the role of the exchange’s management team could diminish, with most operational decisions made autonomously by the community. HTX DAO would become a fully decentralized ecosystem where all rules are transparently executed via on-chain governance. 2. Users as Governors : Every user could earn “governance credits” based on their contributions, building up governance capacity and decision-making power within the community. This mechanism encourages deeper user participation for continuous platform optimization. 3. AI-Assisted Governance Decision-Making : The integration of AI will enable the HTX DAO Forum to incorporate AI analysis tools to support governance decisions. For example, AI can simulate the potential outcomes of proposals based on market data, helping users make more informed voting choices. Conclusion: Starting a New Chapter in Decentralized Finance The launch of the HTX DAO Forum is not just a functional update but a groundbreaking leap forward in the governance model for the crypto industry. It outlines a vision for decentralized, transparent, and user-centric governance for exchanges. This initiative by HTX DAO sets a precedent for the industry’s future development, leading the crypto world toward a new era of more democratic and efficient governance. The future of exchange governance will no longer be dictated by a select few, but driven by every user. This transformation is not just technological but a fundamental shift in mindset and power dynamics. And it all begins with the HTX DAO Forum.

38330902,https://cryptonews.com/?p=323586,1735616340,"Ethereum Price Drop Back to $3,000 Likely – Here’s Why a Rebound Is Likely","The Ethereum (ETH) price is flatlining into the year’s end as traders digest recent price moves and look ahead to what’s to come in 2025. Last around $3,330, the Ethereum price is set to end December with losses of around 10%, after a more-hawkish-than-expected Fed meeting midway through the month triggered a market wide sell-off. That said, ETH continues to trade nearly 40% higher versus its levels prior to incoming US President Donald Trump’s early November election victory. And, while the ETH price has lost momentum in recent weeks and dipped below its 21 and 50DMAs, it continues to find strong support above its 200DMA in the $3,000 area. Chart analysis suggests near-term downside is a possibility in the coming days, particularly with Bitcoin (BTC) looking vulnerable to a pullback under $90,000. But the Ethereum price has many important headwinds going into 2025. Here’s why ETH is likely to pick up in price sooner rather than later and fly back to record highs. Ethereum Price – Strong Comeback in 2025 Likely, Here’s Why Donald Trump’s decisive election victory in November, coupled with the Republicans winning back majorities in the House and Senate, sets up an exciting year for crypto in 2025. Trump’s administration is stacked with pro-crypto leaders, from Treasury Secretary to the new SEC chair, to the newly established AI/Crypto Czar position, the regulatory environment in the USA is about to swing decisively pro-crypto. That might even culminate in the Trump signing off on an order for the USA to start buying BTC for a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Schwab says #Bitcoin could hit $500K–$1M when Trump establishes a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. pic.twitter.com/3cArfgRYTU — Bitcoin Archive (@BTC_Archive) December 6, 2024 Meanwhile, Congress is likely to pass comprehensive crypto regulation to give the industry the certainty it has long craved. That’s a 180 degree swivel from the policies of the incumbent Biden administration, who has worked hand in hand with the SEC and other regulators to make life as difficult as possible for the crypto industry since 2022. Unsurprisingly the outlook for Bitcoin for 2025 is very strong. However, things are potentially even better for major altcoins like the price of Ethereum. The unfriendly US regulatory regime of recent years has hurt the development and adoption of major web3 industries like DeFi. So even if Ethereum was able to escape classification by the SEC as an “unregistered security” and secure spot ETFs in the US, its adoption has been hobbled. But a pro-crypto environment in the should get things moving again, suggesting a great outlook for DeFi/web3 chains like Ethereum. But what about Ethereum’s competitors stealing its shine? Well, competitors will undoubtedly continue to rise. But Ethereum remains the daddy in the altcoin space – over 55% of the total USD value of crypto locked in DeFi smart contracts is on Ethereum per DeFi Llama , thanks to it being the most trusted chain. Moreover, Ethereum has the backing of Wall Street behemoths like BlackRock, who have even launched tokenized investment products on it, plus dozens of other major companies building on it. Major companies building on Ethereum: – BlackRock – Franklin Templeton – PayPal – Robinhood – Visa – Stripe – Google – Venmo – Sony – Samsung – Deutche Bank – Citi Group – UBS – Microsoft – Christies – Fox Corporation – and many more The ticker is ETH — sassal.eth/acc (@sassal0x) November 22, 2024 Ethereum’s competitors are likely to continue growing, but there is no reason why Ethereum won’t continue to power on too. So Where Is Ethereum Headed Next? During past crypto market cycles, when Bitcoin broke out to new all-time highs and entered price discovery, it has taken Ethereum up to two months to follow suit. Bitcoin entered its latest phase of price discovery one and a half months ago. So history would suggest the Ethereum price could be about to test record highs by mid-January. That would line up perfectly with Trump’s inauguration, and could mark gains of as much as 50% from current levels. Once ETH breaks into a new phase of price discovery, the sky is the limit. However, Fibonacci extension levels could give some idea as to how high is likely. For reference, during the 2020 to late 2021 ETH bull market, the Ethereum price rallied to just beyond the 4.236 Fibonacci retracement level beyond its 2017/2018 cycle highs, traced up from its 2020 bear market lows. If ETH can repeat this feat in 2025, it could hit highs in the $17,700s this cycle. That would mark colossal gains of over 5x from current levels. Optimistic? Maybe. But either way, the Ethereum price outlook going into 2025 is bright and ETH in the $3,300 is a bargain.

Here’s what this could mean for BTC’s price. Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Has Seen A Decline Recently The “Fear & Greed Index” refers to an indicator created by Alternative that tells us about the general sentiment present among the traders in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency markets. Related Reading: Dogecoin To Rally 6,770% If This Pattern Holds: Crypto Analyst This metric takes into account for the data of five factors in order to calculate its value: volatility, trading volume, market cap dominance, social media sentiment, and Google Trends. When the value of the index is greater than 53, it means the sentiment shared by the majority of the investors is that of greed. On the other hand, it being under 47 implies fear is dominant in the sector. Naturally, the indicator being between these two cutoffs suggests a net neutral mentality. Now, here is how the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index is like at the moment: As is visible above, the latest value of the indicator is 65, which implies the investors share a sentiment of greed. This is a sharp decrease from where the metric was yesterday, as the below chart shows. Even ignoring the decrease in the past day, it’s apparent that the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index has been going downhill for a while now. The reason behind this worsening in the sentiment is the price decline that BTC has been going through lately. The index’s value was 73 yesterday, which is quite close to a special region known as the extreme greed. The market is said to be holding this sentiment when the index is at 75 or higher. For most of this month, the indicator has actually been inside this zone, as a result of the hype of the cryptocurrency exploring new highs above the $100,000 mark. Historically, Bitcoin has actually tended to move in the direction opposite to what the crowd is expecting, with the probability of such a contrary move occurring only growing the more the investors become sure about a side. Related Reading: Dogecoin Is Observing Bullish Signals On These Indicators Extreme greed is a territory where tops have often occurred for the BTC price as this likelihood is the strongest there. There is a similar region for the fear side as well, called extreme fear and occurring at 25 or lower. With the Bitcoin sentiment seeing a notable decline recently, the asset’s price may no longer be at risk of seeing another major correction. The sentiment is still that of greed, however, so another rally may also not be too likely to happen.

Homosexual Pepe (HOMOPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HOMOPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Homosexual Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homosexual Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Homosexual Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homosexual Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homosexual Pepe by entering its contract address – 92xPeBxtanptFH9AYsRtwRMq7cWWw9GHfxaspwpNvCTP – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMOPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/homosexual-pepe-homopepe-solana-memecoin-to-surge-18000-ahead-of-first-exchange-listing-while-bonk-shib-and-doge-crash/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

38329135,https://coinpedia.org/?p=400253,1735614573,XRP Price Prediction for December 31: Buying Opportunity or Crash Signal?,"The post XRP Price Prediction for December 31: Buying Opportunity or Crash Signal? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The cryptocurrency market remains turbulent, and XRP, Ripple Labs’ native token, is under significant bearish pressure. On December 31, 2024, XRP joins major assets like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL) in the red, raising questions about how deep this decline could go. What makes XRP’s situation particularly interesting is the contrast between its technical indicators and on-chain activity. While the charts suggest further price drops, significant token outflows hint at growing interest from investors. Keep reading as we dive into the critical trends. XRP Technical Analysis: More Decline Ahead? Recent technical analysis shows that XRP has broken out of a descending triangle pattern, indicating a bearish shift. The daily chart reveals that XRP has retested its breakdown level, suggesting the price may continue falling unless strong support is established. Source: Trading View If the overall market sentiment stays negative, XRP could drop another 10% to 12%, potentially testing the $1.83 support level. This outlook has sparked caution among traders while hinting at opportunities for long-term investors. Outflows Suggest Investor Optimism Despite this bearish outlook, traders’ and investors’ interest in the asset remains optimistic, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . Data from XRP’s spot inflow/outflow reveals that exchanges have witnessed an outflow of hundreds of millions of dollars worth of XRP tokens over the past few days. Source: Coinglass These outflows, which represent tokens being transferred from exchanges to private wallets, often indicate buying pressure. Investors seem to be treating the current price dip as an opportunity to accumulate XRP, betting on a future rebound. Short Term vs Long Term While technical analysis suggests XRP remains bearish in the short term, investor accumulation signals confidence in its long-term potential. At the time of writing, XRP is trading near $2.03, reflecting a 4.5% drop in the past 24 hours. This price decline has been accompanied by a 90% surge in trading volume, highlighting increased activity from both traders and investors. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP ETF Likely in 2025?

The claims came from the Chechnya-based State Duma lawmaker Adam Delimkhanov. The MP was speaking in the wake of a recent decision to ban crypto mining in Chechnya and nine other Moscow-controlled regions . Delimkhanov said he was speaking on behalf of the Chechen Head of State Ramzan Kadyrov. Chechnya ‘to Equate Illegal Crypto Mining With Terrorism’ The ban comes into force on January 1, 2025. It will give energy providers, police, and prosecutors new powers to fight illegal miners. The Chechen Head of State Ramzan Kadyrov with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

The lawmaker said that if illegal crypto mining “leads to problems with electricity in a district, village, or city,” the Chechen authorities will respond quickly. “Those responsible for this will be subject to severe punishment.

In the neighboring republic of Dagestan, the local government has pleaded with residents to “consider” their “fellow countryfolk” and power down their rigs.

38328228,https://crypto.news/?p=14323435,1735612502,One of the few that will trend upwards: Analyst about DOGE killer PCHAIN,"Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. PropiChain (PCHAIN) predicted to outshine Dogecoin (DOGE) through its transformative platform. Table of Contents Dogecoin slides, liquidates long traders Analyst: PCHAIN will grow exponentially in 2025 PCHAIN could outperform DOGE in 2025 After an explosive rally starting in early November, Dogecoin (DOGE) is losing momentum after reaching a local high. This has prompted an analyst to pick PropiChain (PCHAIN) as one of the few altcoins that will surge in 2025. PropiChain is a real estate tokenization platform. The project is attracting investors eager to maximize profits in Q1 2025. One of its major selling points is its ability to transform the $300 trillion real estate industry. With Dogecoin losing momentum, PCHAIN offers early investors potentially sustainable growth through its unique features and investor-driven tokenomics. Dogecoin slides, liquidates long traders Dogecoin has lost the momentum that took it to a high of $0.4759. The meme coin has lost 23.3% in the last 24 days. This has resulted in total liquidation reaching $11.18 million, with long position traders contributing $9.90 million. The waning momentum stems from low trading volume and market-wide decline. Analysts claim that Dogecoin could slide below $0.25 in Q1. With Dogecoin losing ground in the past weeks, holders are booking profits as they take a cautionary approach. Analysts say Dogecoin could underperform in 2025 if the altcoin season fails to kick in. Analyst: PCHAIN will grow exponentially in 2025 PCHAIN is a strong contender to earn investors substantial returns in 2025. The real estate altcoin is on course to surge 20,000%. At $0.011 during its ongoing token presale, early investors have a unique opportunity to earn massive returns. The altcoin has already raised over $1 million, a clear sign of its growing appeal. Investors are choosing PCHAIN, drawn by its approach to real estate tokenization . As a tokenization platform, PCHAIN will enable fractional ownership, allowing investors to own pieces of property. This model will democratize the market while allowing more investors to build wealth through real estate investments. Another key reason for PCHAIN’s growing appeal is its incorporation of AI features. With its AI-driven predictive market analysis, the platform will offer users valuable insights into future market trends, providing users with a competitive edge. You might also like: XRP price declines, but PropiChain gains momentum with its AI-powered real estate features Additionally, PCHAIN’s AI will be used in smart contract automation. This is an important feature that removes manual checks and intermediaries, making transactions faster and more efficient. It has made property management easier and is appreciated by property managers, landlords, and tenants. To keep the platform safe, BlockAudit has independently audited PropiChain’s smart contract. This builds trust among users and adds to its credibility. PCHAIN also ventures into the metaverse, seeking to offer users virtual property tours, staging, and meetings. This immersive technology will allow investors to scout properties remotely, saving users time and money. Furthermore, PCHAIN will turn to automated valuation models to offer AI-driven property appraisals. This feature will provide highly accurate, fair valuations free from human errors or bias. PropiChain’s users will benefit from receiving valuations that align with the current market conditions. PCHAIN could outperform DOGE in 2025 Dogecoin has enjoyed impressive gains in Q4 but has seen its momentum wane as the entire market goes into a downward correction. This is evidenced by Dogecoin losing 22% of its value in the past month. On the other hand, PCHAIN is just beginning its upward trajectory. Early investors gained 200% when its presale progressed from the first round to the second. That is not all. The project’s tokenomics and transformative features will help early investors potentially earn 20,000% gains, prompting whales and smart money to invest in its ongoing token presale. PCHAIN has been listed on CoinMarketCap. This has played a key role in showing investors that the project can be trusted. Analysts boldly claim that the project is set to hit its major milestones.

On Binance, the token reached an intraday low of $1.99, showcasing the strong selling pressure currently endured by the crucial support level. XRP, which rallied 230% since November on hopes of Trump’s victory securing the regulatory free pass for the US crypto companies, has been seemingly stuck in a consolidation phase since the beginning of December after exhausting the bullish momentum from post-election euphoria. The rally, initially fueled by speculation around the possible resolution of the Ripple vs SEC lawsuit, can no longer be sustained in the absence of positive regulatory and policy development, and retesting the levels below $2 may not be out of the table for XRP in the near perspective. Not even Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin debut could drastically improve the situation, only resulting in a short-lived pump that failed to hold. For context, RLUSD launched XRP Ledger and Ethereum on December 17 and currently sits at a modest market cap of $53 million. Despite the early stage of adoption, RLUSD saw a sharp rise in trading volume that soared 191% over the last 24 hours. While RLUSD is enjoying the spotlight, XRP faced significant liquidations over the past 24 hours, with $4.46 million of long and $3.34 million worth of short positions wiped out as the price briefly dipped below $2 and then bounced back. The price decline coincides with a decrease in open interest, which currently stands at $1.9 billion, a far cry from $4.3 billion at the beginning of December, as per CoinGlass data. The combination of low XRP price and low OI suggests that traders are closing their positions, seemingly confirming the suspicion that the current price drop is driven by liquidations and profit-taking rather than bears betting against XRP. Should this be the case, the XRP price is likely to stabilize soon in the absence of sustained selling pressure. The exchange volume dropped as well to $3 billion over the past 24 hours, a 50% decline from a week ago. This reduced exchange volume, combined with shrinking open interest, points to waning interest from both bulls and bears amid the holiday-induced slowdown. As fever traders are active, there’s more room for potential volatility, since even modest buying or selling activity would be amplified by reduced market depth. While current indicators point to a rather short-lasting price slip, crypto analyst Dom maintains a rather bearish outlook, describing XRP's recent price action as “incredibly weak.” In their post on Twitter/X, the analyst explained that XRP risks a much more drastic drop in price if it falls into one of the so-called “liquidity voids,” the weak spots left behind if the price of an asset moves too quickly. During a strong bull run that XRP experienced in November, it didn’t have much time for the process of creating value, which happens when the price consolidates for some time at specific levels. The resulting areas of higher trading activity form “volume nodes” that often act as support or resistance. The current support at $1.90 for XRP holds the price from slipping into the liquidity void. However, it becomes weaker every time it is retested, so a slow grind-down through this key level may send XRP as low as t $1.60, the analyst estimates. Conversely, reclaiming the $2.40 resistance will likely trigger a new rally for the cryptocurrency. According to Dom, should BTC fall below $95,000, the odds of XRP breaking below $1.90 increase significantly. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $92.3k, down 1.33% over the last 24 hours. What does 2025 hold for XRP? Looking ahead, XRP’s next move will likely depend on renewed trading activity in early January, with Bitcoin’s performance shaping the direction for the altcoin till the Inauguration Day on January 20. After this date, traders’ attention will be focused on the policy changes brought by the new administration and developments in the Ripple vs SEC case. Among other potential catalysts for XRP price growth are Ripple’s IPO, XRP ETF approval, and the growing adoption of RLUSD. Ripple’s potential IPO, once postponed indefinitely due to the prolonged legal battle with the regulator, can be on the table again once the case is settled, which could boost both the company’s valuation and XRP’s credibility as a reliable investment. Similarly, the approval of an XRP-backed ETF would provide non-crypto-naive investors with hassle-free access to the asset, potentially driving billion inflows into the XRP market cap. Finally, the demand for RLUSD will strengthen the role of XRP as a bridge currency and allow the DeFi ecosystem of XRP Ledger to flourish.",NEGATIVE,BTC | XRP,ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6748/xrp-lingers-above-2-mark-amid-santa-claus-sell-off,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

Despite already being underperformed in the recent bull run, Ethereum has now experienced a notable correction, dropping to as low as below the $3,500 price level in recent weeks. While this price performance from ETH might have led investors to lose interest in Ethereum for now, recent data from the CryptoQuant platform suggests a possible turnaround, with key indicators pointing towards renewed market confidence. Related Reading: Is Ethereum Ready To Break Out? Key Indicators Suggest Strong Market Confidence Funding Rates Indicate Renewed Confidence Among Traders A CryptoQuant analyst, ShayanBTC, highlighted Ethereum’s futures market developments in a recent analysis titled “Ethereum Futures Market Signals Potential Rebound After $3K Correction.” The analysis from Shayan reveals that the futures funding rates, which act as a sentiment gauge for traders, have shown signs of stabilization after the price drop, hinting at a potential recovery. According to the analyst, Ethereum funding rates have shown an increase after the recent sharp correction, indicating a higher appetite among traders for long positions. Notably, funding rates are a mechanism in perpetual futures contracts where traders holding long positions pay short sellers, or vice versa, depending on market sentiment. When funding rates rise, it typically suggests that traders are leaning towards a bullish outlook. Shayan disclosed that the spike in funding rates implies increased demand for Ethereum at its current price level, signaling that traders expect a bounce-back from the $3,000 region. The analyst further explained that such behavior often precedes significant upward price movements, particularly when combined with a period of market consolidation. In his words: The recent spike in funding rates suggests an influx of buyers, which, if sustained, could drive a substantial bullish rebound. This renewed buying pressure has the potential to push Ethereum toward the crucial $4K resistance in the short to mid-term. Ethereum Market Performance After weeks of consistent decline, Ethereum currently trades at a price of $3,310, at the time of writing down by 1.5% in the past day. This market price marks a 32.2% decrease away from its all-time high (ATH) of $4,878, recorded in November 2021. Interestingly despite the drop in ETH’s price, the asset has still managed to see a slight increase in trading volume in the past day.

Solana Network Activity & LINK Price Rises,"Solana’s network activity has reached unprecedented levels, with a transaction count of 67.77 million in a single day, showcasing robust user participation. At the same time, activity from Chainlink whales has increased significantly, with substantial transactions indicating a strong belief in its long-term value. In the middle of these developments, BlockDAG (BDAG) remains a focal point. The latest AMA in December shared vital updates, such as new community initiatives and strategic plans for 2025. The presale for BDAG has been notably successful, gathering $174 million with 17.6 billion BDAG coins distributed to over 170,000 unique holders. As a top crypto coin to watch, BDAG is recognized for its innovative solutions to blockchain scalability and engaging its users effectively. Solana Network Activity Peaks with Record Transaction Volumes Transaction activity on the Solana network has demonstrated resilience, reaching a 12-month high with 67.77 million transactions processed in 24 hours. This surge in Solana network activity has sparked expectations of a positive market shift, especially as SOL’s price finds support within a crucial Fibonacci retracement range between $192.56 and $175.74. The Total Value Locked (TVL) has also hit an impressive 56.05 million SOL, indicating strong engagement within the ecosystem. Analysts believe the increasing Solana network activity could foster more natural demand, possibly aiding in SOL’s price recovery. With derivatives funding rates turning favorable and reduced spot market outflows, the enhanced network performance combined with supportive technical indicators suggests Solana might be setting up for an upcoming breakout. Are Chainlink Whales Preparing for a Significant Price Increase? Chainlink whales are on the move, undertaking substantial transactions that hint at an upcoming price surge. The latest figures show that nine new whale accounts have moved 362,380 LINK tokens, valued at over $8.19 million, from Binance in just two days. This move corresponds with a technical formation known as a double-bottom at $20.12, suggesting a bullish turn. Market watchers are targeting the $30 mark, predicting a 35% rise from its present valuation. On-chain dynamics are favorable, with rising transaction volumes and dwindling exchange reserves pointing to diminishing selling pressure. The accumulating actions of Chainlink whales, along with positive technical signs, reinforce the anticipation of a notable price recovery soon. BlockDAG’s AMA Showcases Project’s Success BlockDAG’s recent AMA session strengthened its commitment to a clear, community-focused approach. This session spanned topics such as sponsorships, upcoming exchange listings, improved support systems, and an official mainnet launch set for 2025. This user-oriented strategy is visible through community-led governance, where thousands contribute to key decisions. The project’s frequent AMAs foster a clear and open environment, enhancing trust and participation within the BlockDAG ecosystem. BlockDAG’s presale achievements are impressive, raising over $174 million and distributing more than 17.6 billion BDAG coins. Early adopters have seen substantial returns, achieving a 2240% ROI. With the current price at $0.0234 in batch 26, it presents an attractive opportunity for newcomers. As the presale approaches the next batch, the growing interest underscores BDAG as a top crypto coin to watch. Continuing with the tradition of community-driven AMAs, the latest in December highlights BlockDAG’s dedication to integrating community feedback into critical decisions. This approach, along with a successful presale, positions BlockDAG as a standout among crypto coins to watch. As the project nears significant exchange listings and unveils more of its ecosystem potential, the increasing excitement hints at a promising future for the platform and its expanding community. Top Crypto Coins to Watch Now Solana’s network activity illustrates the blockchain’s robustness with peak transaction numbers, while Chainlink whale movements suggest heightened interest from key players. Concurrently, BlockDAG keeps drawing attention with its presale surpassing $174 million and over 17.6 billion BDAG coins sold. The latest AMA spotlighted community-centric strategies and the awaited Mainnet launch in 2025, securing BlockDAG’s spot as one of the top crypto coins to watch . For those seeking a project with growth potential and strong community support, BlockDAG presents a compelling chance. With accelerated adoption and presale batches selling quickly, now might be the perfect time to secure BDAG before prices escalate.

Musk AI King (MUSKAI), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKAI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk AI King can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk AI King could become the next viral memecoin. Musk AI King launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk AI King on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk AI King by entering its contract address – 8hfjjhqWbfVZsqxCKVQu115AXUzUPTHZFXZwk81rYTMw – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKAI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/solana-memecoin-musk-ai-king-muskai-will-skyrocket-16000-ahead-of-exchange-listing/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Unlike SUI, Rollblock stands out with its play-to-earn online casino and robust tokenomics. Backed by a deflationary RBLK token model and growing popularity, Rollblock seeks to offer both immediate rewards and long-term potential. With analysts predict exponential growth for Rollblock, its unique blend of utility and earning potential positions it as a top contender in the crypto market. Early Rollblock investors set to earn huge Rollblock is the first Ethereum-based play-to-earn casino. The platform will host over 7000 casino games and thousands of players daily. Rollblock will feature traditional casino games, unique Web3 options, and live sports betting across dozens of countries, providing something for everyone. The RBLK token will power the Rollblock ecosystem. The platform’s deflationary model will use casino revenue to buy back and burn tokens weekly, reducing supply while redistributing a portion as staking rewards. This model strengthens tokenomics and ensures real utility. RBLK is priced at $0.044 in presale stage 9, and it’s generating excitement among investors as analysts anticipate an 800% value appreciation. Rollblock’s presale increases liquidity for its online casino and offers a sensational opportunity for early investors. Once the presale ends and the token is listed, holders will receive weekly dividends.

Its value has increased by 11.6% in the past week, mirroring the broader crypto market as Bitcoin climbs towards $100k. Analysts suggest that XRP could reach $3 if this momentum continues. A prominent analyst, XRP Whale, forecasts that XRP’s price might rally to $3.3 in the coming weeks. Their chart analysis shows XRP trading within an asymmetrical triangle, with the $2.5 level being a critical breakout point. Another expert, Mikybull Crypto, shared a bullish outlook, suggesting XRP’s next target could be $4. Technical indicators support these bullish predictions. The Hull Moving Average and VWMA both display buy signals, pointing to a potential surge. Beyond price action, Ripple’s XRP Ledger has hit a significant milestone. The ledger count exceeded 93 million and is set to surpass 100 million in the future. This milestone shows the adoption and utility of XRP within the crypto ecosystem. Sui could benefit from Trump’s inauguration SUI has been making significant strides, with its Total Value Locked (TVL) hitting $1.8 billion. Investors remain confident, reflecting “Extreme Greed” in market sentiment and maintaining consistent on-chain volumes between $400 million and $600 million. Currently trading near $4.13, analysts expect SUI to surge to $23.77 by 2030, driven by its adoption in DeFi and gaming. Recent market corrections caused SUI to drop by about 13% in the last week, mainly due to profit-taking and holiday-related withdrawals. This dip presents an opportunity to buy SUI at a lower price. Many believe that SUI is an ideal investment, especially with the upcoming inauguration of a pro-crypto US president on January 20th. This event could fuel the crypto bull run and push the market to new heights. Rollblock stands out The market is preparing for a bull run, and altcoins are suitable investment choices. Sui, XRP, and Rollblock could provide diversification and growth potential to crypto portfolios. Rollblock, in particular, offers a unique opportunity.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. SHIB and ADA holders shift to XYZ, a crypto gem ready for 9,600% growth. Table of Contents XYZ as the next big crypto contender Shiba Inu Cardano Conclusion Investors who once championed Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Cardano (ADA) are eyeing a new cryptocurrency that could deliver astounding returns. This up-and-coming token is stirring excitement with projections of a possible 9,600% increase in value. XYZ as the next big crypto contender Unlike the short-lived hype of many meme coins that have buckled under selling pressure, the XYZ token is designed with staying power. Backed by a robust roadmap and a community of dedicated supporters, it has everything in place to not just survive but thrive in the competitive crypto market. XYZ is currently in its presale phase, offering early participants a chance to secure significant discounts before its price skyrockets. Starting at $0.0001, it has already reached $0.001333 in its current stage, delivering impressive returns for those who got in early. With a final target price of $0.1, the projected 7,400% growth is more than just speculation — it’s a calculated opportunity for massive profits. XYZVerse isn’t just about hype — it’s about delivering real value. Unlike many meme coins that falter after their initial surge, this project is built on a foundation of strong fundamentals. Audited smart contracts, a detailed roadmap, and upcoming listings on major exchanges ensure that this token has a clear path to success. For those looking to break away from the stagnation of SHIB and ADA, this gem offers a chance to be part of a new wave of growth. Interested investors can take the XYZ side via presale . You might also like: 5 altcoins on the verge of joining the top 10 with massive growth Shiba Inu Inspired by Dogecoin’s success, Shiba Inu runs on the Ethereum blockchain, giving it access to a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications. SHIB’s integration with Ethereum opens doors to exciting possibilities like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange showing its potential beyond being a simple meme token. There are plans for an NFT platform and a governance system where holders can have a say in development. In the current market cycle, where utility and real-world applications are gaining importance, SHIB’s approach sets it apart from other meme coins. While Dogecoin relies mainly on community and celebrity endorsements, SHIB aims to build a robust ecosystem. This makes it an interesting player to watch in the evolving crypto landscape. Cardano Cardano is making waves in the cryptocurrency world. It’s a flexible, scalable blockchain designed for smart contracts. This means it can support decentralized finance apps, crypto tokens, and games. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, rivals Ethereum’s ETH. Users can store value, make payments, and stake on the Cardano network. What sets Cardano apart is its environmentally friendly approach. It uses the Ouroboros proof-of-stake mechanism, which is energy-efficient compared to traditional proof-of-work models. Its structure is also divided into two layers: one for transactions and one for smart contracts. This boosts capacity, with the goal of potentially handling up to a million transactions per second. In the current market, ADA looks attractive due to its sustainable technology and growth potential. As more investors seek eco-friendly crypto options, Cardano stands out. While Ethereum is still dominant, Cardano’s advancements may position it as a strong alternative in the crypto landscape. Conclusion While SHIB and ADA remain solid choices, XYZVerse’s unique mix of sports and memes positions it for remarkable growth in the 2024 bull run.

The pseudonymous analyst known as Altcoin Sherpa tells his 236,000 followers on the social media platform X that he’s got his eye on Fartcoin ( FARTCOIN ), a memecoin that was created by an anonymous developer referencing the “ideal memecoin” suggested by the artificial intelligence (AI) large language model Truth Terminal. Altcoin Sherpa says he’s looking to accumulate FARTCOIN even if it drops to as low as $0.65. “I’m filling a bit around $0.80ish, approaching my buys.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Evaluating three crypto tokens that could deliver 10,000% gains before Bitcoin hits $150,000. Table of Contents Rexas Finance: Setting the trend of asset tokenization Dogwifhat: The next big meme coin Hedera: Reshaping the efficiency of blockchains Conclusion The development of the cryptocurrency marketplace carries on as new opportunities for significant growth appear. While there is a lot of talk about Bitcoin’s potential to hit $150,000, investors’ attention is now shifting to emerging tokens likely to give returns as high as 10,000% in a shorter time. Among these tokens, Rexas Finance (RXS) , Dogwifhat (WIF), and Hedera (HBAR) stand out. Rexas Finance: Setting the trend of asset tokenization Rexas Finance seeks to shift the blockchain paradigm through transformative tokenization methods, bridging physical assets to the digital ecosystem. Starting at $0.03 when RXS began its presales, it now stands at $0.175 in stage 11. $33 million has been raised, with 381 million tokens sold so far, indicating high market confidence and investor interest. The Rexas ecosystem is about transformation, with tools such as the Rexas Token Builder, which will allow users to create tokens without programming knowledge. The QuickMint Bot will enable the community to build tokens on platforms like Telegram and Discord, allowing a broader audience and adoption. Rexas Finance’s listing on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko has significantly increased its visibility and credibility. With an ongoing $1 million giveaway to attract a community and reward early adopters, RXS is set for significant growth. Its unique ecosystem and positioned approach make it a strong contender for the top crypto positions. You might also like: XRP, DOGE to lose their dominance to $0.175 crypto poised to turn $800 into $32,000 Dogwifhat: The next big meme coin Dogwifhat is taking the meme coin spotlight, having gained considerable traction with its branding and community backing. Currently, WIF is trading at $1.80 and has a market capitalization of $1.79 billion. Dogwifhat stands out through its roadmap, which includes plans for developing utility-driven applications and staking features. These aspects will provide an avenue for real value creation for meme coin holders while maintaining the essence of memes. Its community-oriented approach may help sustain demand and foster further adoption. Price forecasts for WIF suggest potential volatility. Analysts say the token can hit $15 within two years as it matures and its ecosystem thrives. This prediction aligns with its community growth and roadmap. Hedera: Reshaping the efficiency of blockchains Hedera has captured a significant market share through its cutting-edge Hashgraph consensus technique, offering high speed, security, and scalability. Currently valued at $0.2655 with a market cap of around $10.15 billion, HBAR has gained a significant position as an enterprise-grade blockchain solution provider. Hedera’s credibility, potential for global adoption, and recognition as one of the most powerful platforms are further enhanced by alliances with Google, IBM, and Boeing. Such partnerships will most likely circumvent the limitation of a lack of leverage in using Hedera’s platform in supply chain management, finance, and healthcare. There is optimism regarding the price of HBAR, with some analysts believing that by the year 2025, its value could rise to between $3 and $5. Such growth is anticipated as enterprises adopt Hedera and it continues to develop. Conclusion As Bitcoin continues its climb toward the $150,000 milestone, tokens such as RXS, WIF, and HBAR show relatively high potential for returns in shorter timeframes. In asset tokenization, Rexas Finance stands out with the development of new tools and its successful presale. Dogwifhat, as a memecoin with application utility, offers early investors a chance for significant returns. Coupled with enterprise solutions and industry partnerships, Hedera presents a compelling case for growth in the long term. RXS, WIF, and HBAR are all poised to generate massive gains before Bitcoin sets another record, with each having unique systems and robust market momentum.

38325031,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=668100,1735605052,"Dogecoin To Rally 6,770% If This Pattern Holds: Crypto Analyst","An analyst has explained how Dogecoin could end up witnessing a rally of around 6,770% if this pattern continues to follow for the meme coin. Dogecoin Has Been Trading Inside A Long-Term Ascending Channel In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez discussed a long-term pattern in which the weekly price of Dogecoin has been trading inside. The pattern in question is the Ascending Parallel Channel from technical analysis. A Parallel Channel refers to a consolidation pattern that forms when the price of an asset moves inside two parallel trendlines. The upper line is made by joining together successive tops, while the lower one connects bottoms. Related Reading: Dogecoin Is Observing Bullish Signals On These Indicators While the asset is inside the channel, it’s likely to face resistance at the top line and support at the bottom one. A break out of either of these levels could imply a continuation of the trend in that direction. There are three types of Parallel Channels: those parallel to the time axis, those with a positive slope, and those with a negative slope. The first type doesn’t have a specific name, but the latter two do; they are known as the Ascending and Descending Parallel Channels, respectively. Given how these two types have slopped trendlines, they correspond to phases of consolidation in the asset occurring to the upside or downside. Dogecoin has appeared to have been traveling inside one such pattern over the past decade, as the chart shared by the analyst shows. From the graph, it’s visible that the 1-week price of Dogecoin has been stuck inside this Ascending Parallel Channel throughout its history. The most recent retest occurred just earlier in the year when DOGE found a rebound off the bottom line. As Martinez has highlighted in the chart, DOGE’s current trajectory is reminiscent of the trend witnessed during the last two bull cycles. In each of those bull runs, the cryptocurrency saw an initial upward burst followed by a small decline that led to the bull rally proper. Over the last few weeks, Dogecoin has been going down, perhaps indicating that it’s in that stepping-stone decline phase right now. Going by what happened next in the past cycles, it’s possible the meme coin would soon start a rally that would find its top at the upper level of the Ascending Channel. Related Reading: Bitcoin Tokens Have Only Been Getting Older This Bull Run, Analyst Reveals Based on how far away the channel’s upper level currently is, the analyst has noted that it would take Dogecoin a rally of 6,770% to reach there. It now remains to be seen if the Ascending Channel would continue to hold for the meme coin and if anything similar as in history would take place this time around as well. DOGE Price At the time of writing, Dogecoin is floating around $0.32, up over 2% in the last seven days.

Trump the Grinch (TRUMPGRI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPGRI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump the Grinch can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump the Grinch could become the next viral memecoin. Trump the Grinch launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump the Grinch on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump the Grinch by entering its contract address – 93BLFCVkzBwnSUUjiyaVRQSpjEvaXdZe3oS3iyHnhind – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPGRI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trump-the-grinch-trumpgri-solana-memecoin-to-skyrocket-19000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-doge-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Table of Contents Catzilla: Roaring into the future of meme coins Ethena: Synthetic dollar solution on Ethereum Fetch.ai: A decentralized AI network optimizing digital systems Conclusion In the fast-paced realm of digital currencies, unexpected opportunities arise that may drastically change an investor’s position. There are certain under-the-radar cryptocurrencies that could offer such a chance. This piece delves into three promising tokens that might elevate average investors to significant status in the crypto market. Catzilla: Roaring into the future of meme coins Catzilla is more than just another token — it’s a movement. Positioned as the ultimate disruptor in the DeFi and meme coin space, Catzilla takes aim at the flaws of traditional systems while empowering investors with real opportunities for growth. Combining innovation, community spirit, and financial potential, Catzilla promises to be the game-changer crypto enthusiasts have been waiting for.

Its presale structure — starting at $0.0002 and gradually increasing to $0.0016 over 14 stages — offers early investors an 88% discount.

Catzilla aims to create a transparent and inclusive ecosystem, appealing to investors, meme lovers, and crypto newcomers alike. With its blend of humor and financial utility, it stands as a symbol of the endless possibilities within the crypto space. Whether chasing gains or building community connections, Catzilla is a gateway to the next big opportunity. Interested investors can secure CATZILLA tokens via presale. You might also like: SOL aims for $300 next quarter, CATZILLA to soar from $0.0007 to $0.1 Ethena: Synthetic dollar solution on Ethereum Ethena is a synthetic dollar protocol built on Ethereum. It offers a crypto-native form of money that doesn’t rely on traditional banking infrastructure. Alongside this, Ethena provides a globally accessible dollar-denominated savings instrument called the Internet Bond. This aims to combine the stability of the US dollar with the accessibility of blockchain technology. By bridging traditional finance and decentralized platforms, ENA presents potential for those interested in strategic financial solutions.

Based on historical price movements, Fetch.ai’s price could reach as high as $1.024293 by 2025 and up to $1.190916 by 2030, representing significant gains compared to today’s price. The coin looks attractive in the current market cycle due to its focus on AI and decentralized applications. Conclusion While ENA and FET show promise, they may have less short-term potential. Catzilla stands out as the ultimate meme coin hero aiming to bring financial freedom to everyone. With an impressive 700% ROI potential during its presale and triple utility features, Catzilla invites crypto enthusiasts, meme fans, and anime lovers to join the fight against crypto villains.

While cryptos like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin have made waves globally, newer tokens are looking to make their mark. One coin in particular, BTFD Coin, is drawing a lot of attention in th e meme coin community . This post is going to dive into some of the biggest best meme coin presales to Invest in December 2024 you should be keeping an eye on this December. We’ll compare BTFD Coin with two other meme coins: Pepe Coin and Just a Chill Guy. So, buckle up, because you might just find your next big investment. Meme coins have been a major part of the crypto landscape for years, but they’ve gained an even stronger following recently. Some investors are jumping into meme coins simply for the fun of it, while others see a serious opportunity for returns. But here’s the thing: you have to know which ones to invest in. BTFD Coin is not just another meme coin—it’s a token that combines community power, a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game , staking rewards, and an intriguing referral program. Plus, it’s already making waves in its presale stages. The rise of meme coins over the past few years has been nothing short of spectacular, but BTFD Coin is positioning itself to take things to the next level. With its already massive presale success, BTFD has become one of the most talked-about coins in the meme sector. Let’s dive deeper into BTFD Coin, Pepe Coin, and Just a Chill Guy and see how they compare. BTFD Coin: A Strong Contender in the Meme Coin Space When you think about meme coins, you might envision a quick surge in price followed by a crash. But BTFD Coin is different. This token has shown incredible growth, and analysts are already predicting it could outperform many other meme coins in the long run. The presale is now in its 13th phase, with the token priced at $0.000142. So far, it has raised $4.6 million, surpassing milestones of $1 million in the first 10 days and $2.5 million within 14 days. The project proudly counts over 7,000 holders, with 60 billion coins sold already. But what makes BTFD stand out? It’s the combination of community support, rewarding mechanisms, and its unique presale structure. The coin offers a referral program, staking rewards, and a P2E game that’s likely to bring in new users and maintain investor interest in the long term. It’s not just about memes; it’s about building a loyal, engaged community. Now, let’s talk about the economics behind this surge. Back in 1973, the global economy faced a catastrophic collapse, sparking a series of recessions worldwide. Investors who managed to buy during the chaos made massive profits when the economy rebounded. Today, the crypto market is a similar beast. With the presale stages advancing, this is the perfect time to get in before BTFD Coin hits the market. A lot of investors have been comparing this moment to the opportunity of buying during a market crash—buying the dip when prices are still low to maximise future returns. With the BIG50 bonus code available during the presale, investors can get 50% more coins, making this an even more enticing opportunity. The BIG50 bonus adds extra value! Use code BIG50 to receive 50% more tokens on every purchase. For instance, buy 100 coins, and you’ll get 150. Take advantage of this opportunity to invest in $BTFD today. Pepe Coin: A Familiar Meme Coin with a Loyal Following Pepe Coin has built a reputation as one of the most recognizable meme coins in the market. Drawing inspiration from the infamous Pepe the Frog meme, it quickly became a fan favourite in the crypto space. The meme coin has garnered a solid community of supporters and investors who believe in the potential for long-term gains. Unlike BTFD Coin, Pepe Coin’s presale has not seen the same astronomical numbers. However, it’s still holding strong, with a clear focus on maintaining a vibrant online community. Pepe Coin’s value is often driven by its meme status and viral marketing campaigns, so it tends to experience short bursts of growth followed by corrections. While Pepe Coin has its advantages in terms of visibility and community engagement, it lacks some of the innovative elements that BTFD Coin brings to the table. For example, while Pepe Coin might offer community-based rewards, it doesn’t offer the same staking options or referral programs that are built into BTFD Coin’s ecosystem. Moreover, like any meme coin, Pepe Coin’s price volatility makes it a risky investment. However, the community is loyal, and if the token continues to gain popularity, there’s a chance that it could see more significant growth in the future. But for those looking for a coin with more stability and a proven presale success, BTFD Coin might be the better option. Just a Chill Guy: A New Player with Potential Just a Chill Guy is the new kid on the block, offering a unique take on the meme coin space. With a catchy name and an easy-going vibe, it’s certainly got the attention of investors looking for something fresh. But, much like Pepe Coin, Just a Chill Guy’s presale has yet to match the explosive growth of BTFD Coin. The coin’s community is growing steadily, and its developers are focused on creating a relaxed, welcoming environment for investors. The concept is cool—who doesn’t want to invest in something called “Just a Chill Guy?” But while it’s an interesting project, it’s still in the early stages compared to BTFD Coin. Where Just a Chill Guy stands out is its laid-back marketing approach. Instead of focusing heavily on hype, it’s building a community based on inclusivity and fun. However, when it comes to features like staking, P2E games, and referral programs, Just a Chill Guy is still playing catch-up. For those who like the idea of meme coins with a lighthearted theme, Just a Chill Guy might be a good option. But if you’re looking for a meme coin with serious presale potential and rewards, BTFD Coin should be your go-to.

38325184,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53463,1735603245,"Solana Memecoins Taper Off, While RCO Finance Gains Ground with 40,000% Expected Upside","The once-vibrant Solana memecoins ecosystem is showing signs of decline, as trading activity slows and hype diminishes.

The Gold Ticket from BlockDAG (BDAG) emerges as a standout option, delivering not only the best chances to win $1M USDT but also significant BDAG coin rewards, attracting both experienced participants and newcomers. While promising projects like Aave and Aptos navigate their own obstacles—Aave with market downturns, and Aptos trying to keep up its growth—BlockDAG’s approach of blending real incentives with a solid presale offers a richer value proposition to those taking part. BlockDAG’s Gold Ticket: Your Top Shot at $1M USDT BlockDAG’s Gold Ticket shines as the top pick in the $1M USDT New Year’s Raffle, presenting the best chance to win the grand prize of $1 million. At a cost of 500 USDT, it brings incredible worth by including a 200% BDAG coin bonus with every purchase. This dual advantage positions the Gold Ticket as an elite option for those wanting to add excitement to their crypto holdings while gaining a significant boost. Additionally, BlockDAG’s strong track record in the crypto market adds to its appeal. Presently in its 26th crypto presale phase, the initiative has gathered $173.5 million through the sale of over 17.6 billion BDAG coins. With the coins now valued at $0.0234, showing a rise of 2240% since the initial batch, it indicates robust confidence and participation. Unlike the lesser Bronze and Silver tickets, the Gold Ticket is specifically designed for those aiming to maximize their winning potential. The higher entry fee not only raises the odds of landing the main prize but also ensures noteworthy BDAG coin rewards, appealing both to those with experience and those looking to make a significant impact on their holdings. In conclusion, within BlockDAG’s New Year campaign, the Gold Ticket stands out as the most advantageous option. It is designed for those who appreciate both the opportunity and strategic planning, making it the optimal choice for entering the new year poised for success and the best possible outcome. Aave Faces Steep Price Drop Amid Market Sell-Off Aave, a top decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, is undergoing a significant price correction as market participants cash in on recent rises. Following a sustained increase, Aave’s price is now experiencing heavy pressure, with indications of a looming sharp decline. This pattern is typical in the crypto market, where swift price increases often lead to large-scale sales, increasing market unpredictability. This downturn mirrors broader difficulties across the DeFi landscape, underscoring the importance of prudent trading practices. Analysis of Aave’s technical indicators also points to potential additional losses, with vital support levels endangered. However, such downturns may provide entry opportunities for those wishing to join the market more affordably. Aptos Eyes $19 as TVL Reaches $1.29 Billion Aptos is gaining traction as its Total Value Locked (TVL) reaches $1.29 billion, indicating strong growth in its ecosystem and user base. This increase reflects the platform’s rising role in the decentralized finance sector, bolstered by new user acquisition and strategic alliances. Aptos’ blockchain, celebrated for its scalability and efficiency, enhances confidence, suggesting a bullish outlook. With the price of APT nearing $19, market sentiment is bullish, fueled by broader adoption and solid platform fundamentals. Market analysts note the increasing DeFi activities on Aptos and its technological improvements as significant factors in its positioning as a prominent crypto player. As Aptos progresses on its developmental goals and enriches its ecosystem, it remains a key project to consider for sustained growth potential. The Bottom Line In today’s fluctuating market, BlockDAG’s Gold Ticket presents an appealing mix of strategic benefits and concrete incentives. As Aave navigates price volatility and Aptos advances its ecosystem, BlockDAG stands out by syncing market dynamics with user rewards. The Gold Ticket offers enhanced chances of winning and BDAG coin bonuses, providing a realistic option for both seasoned participants and newcomers. Focusing on substantial rewards and a solid structure, BlockDAG offers a focused and beneficial route for those seeking immediate and enduring value in the cryptocurrency market.
