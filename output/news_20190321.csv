Neither the cards nor the FDIC accounts existed, though Rice accepted both crypto and fiat during his ICO, which the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) halted in January 2018.  According to his plea agreement, the U.S. government and Rice have agreed that the defendant should spend 60 months in prison. He faces a maximum sentence of 20 years, a $5 million fine, three years' supervised release, restitution and forfeiture.  The plea deal is dependent on federal judge Ed Kinkeade, of the U.S. District Court, Northern District of Texas, signing off on the 60-month sentence.  The FBI arrested Rice last November, after the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Northern District of Texas charged him with three counts of securities fraud and three counts of wire fraud.  Rice has already settled a civil charge with the SEC, paying $2.7 million in disgorgement and another roughly $190,000 in penalties. His former chief operating officer, Stanley Ford, settled similar charges with an identical monetary fine.  Neither admitted or denied the SEC's charges, though both have agreed to lifetime bans from serving as officers or directors of public companies, as well as a lifetime ban from participating in digital securities offerings.

According to a report from local news source e-Kathimerini on Thursday, Vinnik, a Russian national, has filed an appeal in a Piraeus city court for release or extradition to his home nation for humanitarian reasons.  Vinnik was arrested in Greece back in July 2017, after police alleged that he had laundered at least $4 billion in cash through a bitcoin platform since 2011. He was detained for money laundering, conspiracy and transacting in cash obtained through illegal means.  Since his arrest, Vinnik's extradition has been sought by the governments of the U.S., Russia and, more recently, France.  To date, Vinnik has maintained that he is innocent of all charges. He once said: “I do not consider myself guilty … The fact that I worked for BTC-e and did my job, and it’s not justifiable to accuse me of it.”  Vinnik has been on a hunger strike for 90 days, according to the report from e-Kathimerini, and was transported to the court by ambulance.  Vinnik’s lawyers say his life is ""at risk"" and maintain that the charges against him are ""unfounded,"" e-Kathimerini writes. They have also criticized the Greek justice system for detaining him for ""more than the maximum 18 months permitted for pre-trial detention.""  The U.S. Department of Justice levied a $110 million fine against BTC-e and a $12 million penalty against Vinnik back in July 2017. If convicted in the U.S., Vinnik could face up to 55 years in prison.  Earlier this month, WEX, the apparent successor to the shuttered BTC-e exchange, was again tied to illicit funds gained through ransomware attacks. ""Big Four"" consulting firm PwC said that two Iranians who have created the SamSam ransomware variant are tied to WEX and may have used it to launder millions in illegal earnings.

42430310,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMr4Nh,1553191814,MakerDAO Votes to Increase Fees 4% on Ethereum Stablecoin DAI,"UPDATE: MakerDAO token holders have officially voted to increase the DAI Stability Fee to 7.5 percent.    _______    MakerDAO token holders have again voted to increase fees charged to those taking out programmatic loans on the blockchain through its U.S. dollar-backed ethereum stablecoin DAI.  The fourth and largest fee hike to the DAI “Stability Fee,"" users who take out loans with MakerDAO to generate new DAI will soon be required to pay a 7.5 percent fee when closing out the loan.  As explained in the MakerDAO white paper, the Stability Fee “is an annual percentage yield that is calculated on top of the existing debt” and funneled into a smart contract called the “Burner.”  No funds can be moved from the Burner contract and all MakerDAO tokens (MKR) held within it are destroyed. The purpose of the fee is strictly to address imbalances in supply and demand of the DAI token that cause its valuation to stray away from the dollar.  Yet, since February, DAI's valuation has persistently fallen short of $1, and as MakerDAO’s head of trading Joseph Quintilian noted during a governance call last Thursday, over-the-counter trading for the DAI persists between the $0.95 and $0.99 range.  During Thursday's scientific risk and governance call, risk management lead at the MakerDAO Foundation Cyrus Younessi highlighted that last week there was an initial boost to DAI market price – likely as an outcome of the 2 percent increase to the Stability Fee – but prices again have retracted to below the targeted $1 valuation.    Source: https://dai.stablecoin.science/    By raising fees, MakerDAO token holders hope to cause a contraction to the DAI supply relative to the continued demand and thereby push the dollar peg up to a steady $1 valuation.  Quintilian explained during today’s call:  ”A lot of the [trade] inventories are saturated right now. All of the inventories are complaining we have way too much DAI [in circulation].”  Looking ahead, MakerDAO token holders will vote to ratify the decision and execute the 4 percent Stability Fee hike into the protocol. During last week’s executive vote to implement a 2 percent fee raise, MKR holders were able to ratify the increase in roughly 10 hours with a total of 37 votes.  Having concluded the first round of voting with roughly 40,700 MKR tokens staked in support of the proposal today, the executive vote will be launched tomorrow at 17:00 (UTC).  About this initial round of polling, Richard Brown – head of core community at the MakerDAO Foundation – noted today that ""more active voters [participated] than the previous executive vote we had.""  In addition, he highlighted that a total of 73 percent of voters who staked MKR tokens voted in favor of the 4 percent raise. Of the total MKR tokens staked, 75.6 percent were staked in favor of the 4 percent raise.  ""There's this interesting alignment of Maker tokens staked and number of people involved...We've seen a good distribution of people signaling regardless of whether they are a whale or not, which implies we have a healthy [voting] system,"" said Brown before the governance poll officially closed.  Looking ahead to the executive polling, Younessi said:  ""We did see a slight drop off in the DAI supply [as of late] which is a positive sign. One of the few positive signs we've seen ... It will be interesting to see if that trend continues when the executive polling runs.""

42430321,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMr4jh,1553189708,"Not Just BNB: Up 120%, Huobi's Crypto Exchange Coin Is Breaking Out","Following in the footsteps of the world’s largest exchange cryptocurrency, Binance Coin (BNB), another exchange coin, Huobi Token (HT), is flashing a more than 100 percent price increase in 2019.  Used as an alternative to trading fees on their respective exchanges, exchange cryptocurrencies are also commonly paired with other cryptocurrencies to form new markets and increase overall liquidity.  Recently, however, Binance created a new demand driver for its token by requiring participants of its token sale platform Binance Launchpad to make purchases either with bitcoin (BTC) or BNB.  While that is likely not the only cause for BNB’s near 200 percent surge this year, the cryptocurrency’s growth may have been too much for competing exchanges to ignore.  Singapore-based cryptocurrency exchange, Huobi, is following in Binance’s footsteps by creating a token sale platform of its own called “Huobi Prime.” Not only will Huobi Prime enable purchases via its native token HT, the platform will take things one step further by allowing purchased tokens to be instantly tradeable in HT markets.  Set to go live on March 26 for the sale of Top Network (TOP), the new demand drivers for HT have seemingly revved up investor interest, at one point having increased nearly 40 percent in price over the past two days alone.  That said, HT’s market began to take a bullish turn well before Huobi Prime was announced, a trend similarly seen on the price charts of other native exchange tokens.  As can be seen above, some of the largest exchange coins in the cryptocurrency market have posted notable gains so far this year and have outperformed the usual market trendsetter bitcoin (BTC/USD).  At press time, BNB is still the best performer or the group now up 145 percent year date, but HT is quickly becoming a contender while boasting a 123 percent price increase. The performance of Kucoin Shares (KCS), the cryptocurrency native the KuCoin exchange is also reporting notable year-to-date growth of 69 percent.  A recent surge in HT trading volumes also makes the newfound interest in the exchange coin apparent. In the last 24 hours alone more than $170 million worth of HT has traded hands – a value close to $50 million more than its entire market capitalization of $125 million, according to CoinMarketCap.  If Huobi Prime attracts interest comparable to the Binance Launchpad, which managed to sell out of the offered tokens in just minutes for each of its sales this year, more token sale platforms backed by cryptocurrency exchanges may be a trend to watch out for in 2019.

That's according to a letter sent to creditors Wednesday from Miller Thomson, one of two law firms appointed as representative counsel for Quadriga customers by the Nova Scotia Supreme Court.  Stewart McKelvey withdrew from representing Quadriga in the creditor protection proceedings on March 13, citing a ""potential conflict"" raised by other parties. The firm said at the time it did not know what the conflict was.  But according to the Miller Thomson letter, shared on Telegram and confirmed as genuine by an attorney with the firm, both the representative counsel and the exchange's court-appointed monitor Ernst & Young (EY) had issues with Stewart McKelvey representing both Quadriga and Robertson (who is also acting as the executor of her late husband's estate).  According to the document:  ""Representative Counsel sent two letters to Applicants’ Counsel expressing discomfort with the conflicts of interest presented by Stewart McKelvey’s representation of both the Applicants and Ms. Robertson. The Monitor expressed similar concerns. We advised Applicants’ Counsel that, in our view, this represented an irreconcilable conflict that needed to be addressed without delay.""  Stewart McKelvey's attorneys ""eventually acknowledged the conflict,"" the communication added, and while it initially intended to create a proposal to address this conflict, the firm informed both Miller Thomson, Cox & Palmer (the other law firm appointed as representative counsel) and EY that it would be withdrawing as counsel for Quadriga ""after repeated follow-ups.""  The law firm will continue to represent Robertson personally in the ongoing matter.  Next steps  Miller Thomson, Cox & Palmer, Nova Scotia Supreme Court Justice Michael Wood, Stewart McKelvey, EY and Peter Wedlake (the court-appointed chief restructuring officer for Quadriga) held a conference call to determine the next steps on March 18.  According to the Miller Thomson communication, ""the parties expect to be back in Court to address the next steps in these [Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act] proceedings as early as next week.""  Neither a transcript nor a recording of this call was immediately available. Stewart McKelvey and EY did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Stewart McKelvey initially filed for creditor protection on QuadrigaCX's behalf at the end of January, when the exchange revealed that it could not access nearly $136 million in cryptocurrencies said to be held in cold storage wallets (though there is doubt that these holdings actually exist).

42430323,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMr4hh,1553180722,"Bitmain Set to Deploy $80 Million Worth of Bitcoin Miners, Sources Say","The Takeaway  Bitmain is planning to deploy 200,000 units of its own mining equipment in China to take advantage of cheap hydroelectric power this summer.  The equipment is conservatively estimated to cost $80 million, but it may be more profitable right now for Bitmain to mine crypto itself than try to sell all this inventory.  The move signals a broader shift in the market, with miners preparing to invest again following last year's contraction in capacity.      Bitmain, the largest manufacturer of cryptocurrency mining equipment by market share, is scaling up its capacity to mine ahead of an expected drop in electricity costs in China this summer.  According to mining farm operators in China’s southwestern provinces familiar with Bitmain’s plan, the Beijing-based company will be deploying about 200,000 units of its own mining equipment in the area to take advantage of the low electricity costs during the summer resulting from excess hydropower.  Though the rainy season in southwestern China, including Sichuan and Yunnan, will not arrive until May, Bitmain has already started discussions and making deals with farms to host its equipment so that it can be fully prepared, the sources said.  The firm will mostly use its new products such as the AntMiner S11 and S15, the sources added, with some older models like the AntMiner S9i/j. (The latest models S11, S15 and T15 are all marked as sold out on Bitmain’s own online shop.) It's unclear which proof-of-work cryptocurrencies the company will mine using the machines.  Still, that’s a non-negligible opportunity cost, for a firm whose revenue comes predominantly from equipment sales rather than self-mining.  The S9j and S11 retail for $400 and $500 on its website, respectively, so 200,000 units of those models would be worth around $80 million to $100 million if Bitmain could sell all the inventory. And that doesn't include the S15, which is priced at around $1,000.  But under current conditions, self-mining with S9j, S11 and S15 might still be a somewhat safer bet than trying to sell all those machines in a bear market, according to the miner profit index tracked by the world's third-largest mining pool f2pool.  The index shows that a single S9j, S11, and S15 can generate a daily profit of $0.87, $1.8 and $2.88, respectively, based on bitcoin’s current price and a benchmark electricity cost of $0.05 per kilowatt hour.  While it’s unclear what electricity deal Bitmain can get eventually, mining farm operators said the cost in the summer on average is around $0.037 per kilowatt hour. Taking that into f2pool’s index equation, each S9j, S11 and S15 could return a daily profit of $1.29, $2.24, or $3.38, respectively.  Even assuming the 200,000 machines will all be the lower-end S9j, the capacity could potentially bring home a monthly profit of about $7.7 million for Bitmain.  When reached by CoinDesk, a spokesperson for the company declined to comment.  Market shift  The imminent scaling up of Bitmain’s operations signals a notable market shift.  Last year, amid an overall cryptocurrency market slump, more than 600,000 bitcoin miners were estimated to have shut down at one point. This led to an increasing supply of second-hand mining equipment that was sold at a discount, such as the AntMiner S9.  The decline of mining activity last year had also been reflected in changes at Bitmain’s existing proprietary mining operations.  According to the archive page of Bitmain’s hash rate disclosure blog, on Oct. 9, 2018, all Bitmain-owned hardware that was mining the SHA265 algorithm-based bitcoin generated a hash rate of about 2,339 quadrillion hashes per second (PH/s).  Assuming Bitmain’s self-mining hash rate all came from the AntMiner S9 – each having a hash rate of about 14 trillion hashes per second (TH/s) – that suggests the company had about 170,000 machines running at the time. (1PH/s equals 1,000 TH/s.)  But as of March 5, the hash rate of Bitmain’s operations had decreased to 1,692 PH/s, implying, under the same assumptions, that the company unplugged about 50,000 miners over the past several months and had around 120,000 sets of equipment running in early March.  The hash rate of the bitcoin and bitcoin cash networks on that date was about 44,973 PH/s and 1,500 PH/s, respectively, meaning Bitmain’s proprietary mining contributed around 3.6 percent of the SHA265 algorithm-based networks' combined computation early this month.  Now, it looks as though things are about to change. With excess electricity generated by hydropower stations in China’s mountainous southwest that could be as low as $0.037 per kilowatt hour, the opportunity to mine profitably again has attracted an influx of miners to the region.  Assuming Bitmain’s new capacity will all be using its new AntMiner S11 with a 19.5 TH/s hash rate, the 200,000 units of planned new capacity means the company could be adding another 3,800 PH/s of computing power.  Currently, the bitcoin network hash rate is around 48,000 PH/s, according to data from Blockchain.info, so all else equal, Bitmain’s investment could increase the amount of computing power devoted to securing the network by 7.9 percent.  To be sure, it’s unclear at this stage how much the hash rate of the whole bitcoin network will be in the coming wet season. But some have estimated it could climb up to 70 quintillion hashes per second (EH/s), above the network’s all-time-high around 60 EH/s, because of the new investments being made by Bitmain and other miners.  Drop in the bucket  That said, it’s important to note that proprietary mining, which once accounted for a significant slice to Bitmain’s revenues, has shrunk in percentage terms to a sliver of the total.  According to financial results disclosed by Bitmain when it filed for an initial public offering on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange last September, self-mining revenue dropped from 20.3 percent of the total in 2015 to 7.9 percent in 2017 and was just 3.3 percent for the first half of 2018.  Meanwhile, the company’s top line has increasingly relied on the sales of mining hardware, which increased from 78.6 percent of total revenues in 2015 to 80.5 percent in 2017, and reached 94.3 percent for the six months ending June 30, 2018.  However, the bear market for crypto has taken its toll, especially in the second half of last year.  According to unreleased financial data previously reported by CoinDesk, Bitmain suffered a net loss of around $500 million during the third quarter of 2018.  As of June 30, 2018, Bitmain had opened 11 mining farms located in Sichuan, Xinjiang, and Inner Mongolia with an aggregated capacity to store about 200,000 sets of mining hardware.  These farms are used for self-mining and hosting others' miners, and are separate from the ones where the company is now deploying its machines.  The company disclosed that its self-mining hash rate in July 2018 was about 1692 PH/s, meaning Bitmain had about 120,000 machines running at the time.

Reported by Finance Magnates on Wednesday, the deal will see the ethereum wallet-generating service rolled out in the Finney's built-in cold (offline) wallet.  MyEtherWallet users will also be able to buy the smartphone through the wallet service's web and app platforms. The firm further sees the deal as a way for Finney users to more easily access ether (ETH) and control their private keys, according to the report.  Sirin Labs CEO Zvika Landau was quoted as saying that the integration is a move toward a ""greater market share for both companies, as the two products complement each other.”  MyEtherWallet confirmed the new relationship in a tweet Thursday.  As detailed in November, the Finney phone takes a focus on secure storage of owners' cryptocurrencies. It notably provides a cold (offline) storage wallet that the firm told CoinDesk is effectively a second device stashed in the phone's housing. The wallet even boasts a separate processor and users will interact with it via a second LCD screen – the only place security seed phrases can be typed in.  The Finney is also designed to make crypto easier to use, and will convert between different tokens as needed by users when operating different apps, although at launch token choice was limited. Sirin updated the phone earlier this month to support all ethereum ERC-20 tokens, as well as dash and litecoin.  The phone runs on a modified version of Android, called SirinOS, which is designed with blockchain functionality in mind.  Other features include a physical switch for wallet security, encrypted communications and three-factor authentication, according to the Finney website.  The Israel-based company has said it raised over $157 million via an initial coin offering (ICO) last year to fund the device’s development.  MyEtherWallet founder and CEO Kosala Hemachandra said in yesterday's report:  “We believe having an on-phone hardware wallet is immensely valuable to users.

42430297,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMqwZh,1553173220,"Numerai Token Sale Raises $11 Million From VC Firms Paradigm, Placeholder","Few companies in 2019 have managed to attract venture capitalists to private token sales without giving up equity. Yet the hedge fund and predictions market startup Numerai just closed an $11 million round in March led by Paradigm and Placeholder strictly by selling NMR tokens, first launched through an airdrop in 2017.  According to Numerai founder Richard Craib, every week roughly 1,000 stakes are made with these ethereum-based tokens to buy and sell market predictions on the startup’s data marketplace.  Craib told CoinDesk the funding will primarily go toward hiring engineers to help launch Erasure, the decentralized offspring of Numerai’s existing marketplace, so that anyone can load data related to a wide range of markets beyond stocks and traditional assets. Numerai’s current platform has 44,000 registered users, Craib said.  Speaking to why Placeholder wanted to invest through tokens rather than equity, Placeholder partner Joel Monegro told CoinDesk:  “The way we think of our investing in decentralized crypto networks is underwriting, capitalizing the network. … As more people come to buy and sell data from each other, the role of big financial investors like ourselves diminishes over time. Then we can gradually begin to exit our position as the network becomes self-sustaining.”  Monegro went on to say that Erasure will take the idea Numerai developed with its own fund – essentially crowdsourcing insights incentivized by token rewards – and use it to “break open the investment market” by allowing any party to buy or sell predictions on a public blockchain network scheduled for launch later this year.  Now, by purchasing NMR, both Placeholder and Paradigm have invested directly in the Erasure protocol rather than its parent startup.  “They’re now doubling down and helping us when crypto fundraising has kind of dried up. It’s really a bloodbath,” Craib said. “I think this is a great time to be a real project, but there are only a handful of real ones.”  Paradigm co-founder Fred Ehrsam told CoinDesk he was drawn to the opportunity because Numerai has an existing track record of enabling people to directly monetize data.  “Most proposals to do this are abstract and complex,” Ehrsam told CoinDesk in an email. “We are interested in Erasure because it is concrete (it has a first use case and customer, Numerai) and simple (the mechanism is just writing encrypted predictions to the chain with the ability to sell them).”  Breaking open the market  When Erasure launches later this year, Craib says users will be able to directly connect their crypto wallets to the ethereum-based marketplace.  “Erasure is unbundling investment insight from investment execution,” said Placeholder’s Monegro, adding that this allows anyone to create a provable track record for the quality of their research.  Stepping back, data sellers already use NMR tokens to stake their tokenized reputations, which discourages subpar predictions. Tokens are burned if the predictions are wrong; prediction-makers gain tokens if their models prove correct. This rewards system allows data analysts to monetize their insights.  With Erasure, more people will be able to participate in the above process, selling their predictions to any investment fund participating in the public network. In order to do this, Erasure’s network will leverage the peer-to-peer InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) for dispersed data storage.  “All the staking happens on ethereum, with the NMR token, and all the data exists on IPFS,” Craib said.  At the moment, most Numerai-hosted prediction models focus on traditional assets. But once Erasure launches, Craib said people could upload any market predictions they want.  “I think predicting crypto would definitely be a very natural use case as well,” he added.  Correction (21:45 UTC, March 22, 2019): This article has been updated to clarify that about 1,000 stakes are made every week.

42430301,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMqwhh,1553167249,Bitcoin Price Charts Echo Pattern Seen Before 2015 Bull Market,"View  Bitcoin's drop from a record high of $20,000 clocked in December 2017 has ended up creating a falling channel similar to the one created in the 18 months leading up to the long-term bullish reversal seen in October 2015.  If the same sequence of events unfolds, BTC could see a channel breakout later this year. An early move out of the falling channel cannot be ruled out, but may not yield stronger rally while the crucial 21-week moving average is trending south.  The short-term bullish view put forward by the long-tailed doji candle created on Feb. 27 would gain credence if prices break above $4,040 in the next 24 hours, validating the bullish outside reversal candle on the three-day chart. That would open the doors to re-test of recent highs near $4,200.  A repeated failure to break above $4,040 could end up fueling a pullback to immediate support at $3,927 (March 17 low).  Bitcoin's (BTC) 14-month bear market has ended up creating a similar price pattern to one that paved the way for a bull run in 2015.  The cryptomarket leader is currently trading at $4,030 on Bitstamp, having hit a low of $3,122 in December. Despite the recovery rally, the price is still down 79.85 percent from the record high of $20,000 reached in December 2017.  Throughout the sell-off, the cryptocurrency has charted a series of lower highs and lower lows, known as descending channel in technical parlance.  Bitcoin produced a similar pattern during the previous bear market witnessed in 2014–2015. More importantly, the upside break of that falling channel, confirmed in October 2015, was followed by a two-year bull market.  Therefore, a potential upside break of the latest falling channel could be considered a sign of a long-term bearish-to-bullish trend change.  Weekly line chart  As can be seen above, the price action seen over the last 14 months looks very similar to that seen in 2014 and early 2015.  The previous bear market had stalled with the 14-week relative strength index (RSI) hitting oversold levels below 30 in January 2015.  Similarly, the sell-off from the record high of $20,000 hit in December 2017 also ran out of steam with the RSI falling below 30 in December 2018.  So, if history repeats itself, the cryptocurrency may see a sustained channel breakout later this year.  An early move above the upper edge of the channel, currently at $4,070, could be seen as several indicators are flashing early signs of bullish reversal. Further, BTC is trading just below the breakout price at press time.  Such an early move, however, could be short-lived or may lack a strong follow-through as long as the 21-week moving average (MA) is trending south. As of writing, the MA resistance is seen at $4,073.  Daily chart  Both the higher lows-higher highs pattern and the ascending 5- and 10-day MAs seen on the daily chart indicate the path of least resistance is to the higher side.  As a result, the cryptocurrency may soon validate the bullish outside reversal candle on the three-day chart with a convincing move above $4,040, as discussed yesterday. That would allow a rally to recent highs near $4,200.  The short-term bullish case would weaken if prices drop below $3,927 (Mar. 17 low).

42430285,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMqwBh,1553162723,Mt Gox Trustee Approves Creditor Claims Worth Billions,"Update (10:45 UTC, March 21, 2019): Added details of Mt. Gox's remaining holdings and approved payouts as provided by the trustee.  The long-defunct bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox is finally moving toward settling creditors’ accounts in cryptocurrency or cash.  The exchange's rehabilitation trustee, Nobuaki Kobayashi, announced Tuesday that he had either approved or disapproved creditors’ claims and had also notified the Tokyo District Court about the step taken.  In the next few days, the trustee said he will declare the results of his decisions on the claims and creditors will be notified by various means.  For instance, those who filed claims through the Mt. Gox online filing system will be able to check the results by logging into the system. Those who filed their claims through the supplementary online or the offline methods will be notified via an email from the trustee.  Creditors who did not file claims will still have their claims acknowledged by the trustee in line with the Civil Rehabilitation Act of Japan, according to the statement:  “The Rehabilitation Trustee has approved Exchange-Related Rehabilitation Claims that have been acknowledged based on balances in the MTGOX Bitcoin exchange database, including those that Users have not duly filed.”  Funding mismatch  The trustee also provided details of the current balance of the exchange on March 20, saying that in total it holds 69,553,086,521 Japanese yen ($629,594,540) in cash.  The statement added: ""However, among the account balance that has been secured, the Rehabilitation Trustee has established the trust as the measure to secure the interests of bankruptcy creditors and entrusted the amount of JPY 15,894,588,396 [$143,881,490] (including an amount expected to be appropriated for various expenses of the trust) in the trust.""  The exchange also holds 141,686.35 BTC and 142,846.35 BCH, as of March 19. In total, the cryptocurrency is worth over $593 million at today's prices.  ""The Rehabilitation Trustee has been still investigating the existence of additional BTC held by the Rehabilitation Debtor,"" the trustee added.  The document also indicates that it has approved claims for 802,521 BTC (worth $3,233,256,500), 792,296 BCH ($124,953,000), $38,165,664 in U.S. dollars, and other amounts in various fiat currencies.  Notably, there is a large shortfall from what is still held in crypto and what is due to be paid out. It is not clear how that matter will be addressed when payments eventually start.  The trustee also offered a timeline for finalizing a proposal for a rehabilitation plan, giving a deadline of April 26, 2019.  Mt Gox saga  Mt. Gox, once the world’s largest bitcoin exchange by trading volume, officially filed for liquidation in April 2014 after claiming to have been hacked for 850,000 bitcoin, some of which was later found in a ""forgotten"" wallet. At the same time, it dealt a blow to investors by dropping its plan for civil rehabilitation.  After a long wait, creditors had a victory in June 2018, when the Tokyo District Court issued an order approving a petition to begin civil rehabilitation, allowing creditors to be repaid in their original crypto holdings rather then the fiat value at the time of the collapse. The petition was initially submitted in November of 2017.  The deadline for filing civil rehabilitation claims has been extended several times, first to Oct. 22, then Dec. 26 and later to March 15.  When approved creditors finally start receiving their payments, bitcoin’s price could be affected if there should be a sudden flood of coins on the market. The exchange's trustee has previously been accused of causing of a decline in bitcoin prices since December 2017 by selling off $400 million in bitcoin and bitcoin cash belonging to the estate.  “Following consultation with cryptocurrency experts, I sold BTC and BCC [BCH], not by an ordinary sale through the BTC/BCC exchange, but in a manner that would avoid affecting the market price, while ensuring the security of the transaction to the [greatest] extent possible,” Kobayashi responded in a Q&A with creditors.  Early last month, Goxdox, a site dedicated to supporting the creditors of Mt. Gox, published images of bank transactions, showing that millions of dollars-worth of cryptocurrency from Mt. Gox may have been sold on the the open market through Japan’s BitPoint exchange in 2018, which, the site suggested, may have led to sharp volatility in bitcoin price during the period.  Former Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles was found guilty of wrongfully making electronic records connected to Mt. Gox’s books, but innocent on charges of embezzlement and breach of trust, in the Tokyo District Court last week. he received a suspended sentence of two and a half years.  Mt.

In an announcement Wednesday, the Switzerland-based firm's chairman, Lars Seier Christensen, said Rasmussen will play a “pivotal” role in the firm’s global expansion plans.  Concordium was founded by Christensen, who also founded Saxo Bank and was formerly its CEO. The startup is building what it describes as an identity (ID) and know-your-customer (KYC)-validating, regulatorily compliant blockchain network.  The firm launched a proof-of-concept (PoC) of the service back in January, with a beta release expected in Q3 of this year and a full public launch in Q1 2020.  Christensen said Concordium plans to move into areas that would require a blockchain solution for “secure and private communications, as well as liaising with governmental departments.”  The network will support ""tamper-proof"" voting systems to ""protect the institutions of civil society, which are fundamental to the functioning of democracy,"" he added.  Rasmussen, who served three terms as prime minister of Denmark from 2001–2009, and as secretary-general of NATO from 2009–2014, said in the announcement:  ""We are only beginning to see the benefits that blockchain technology will bring to our societies, including in our democratic processes. Concordium's blockchain-based voting solution offers a means of voting that is trustworthy, quick, and cost-effective. I am pleased to be working with Concordium to make sure that every vote is counted.""  Concordium aims to combine a built-in anti-money-laundering (AML) and KYC function with zero-knowledge proof privacy tech and compliance with the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The project is also developing a cryptocurrency called GTU (global transactions unit), also with a built-in compliance function.  Back in January, former vice chairman of NASDAQ Europe, Hans-Ole Jochumsen, also joined the firm's advisory board to guide the firm on its compliance efforts with his expertise in taxation, know-your-customer (KYC) practices and transaction provenance.

42430292,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMqwPh,1553142909,Lightning Labs Releases 'Loop' Feature for Bitcoin Payments Channels,"Lightning Labs has released a new feature aimed at improving the usability of the lightning network, a bitcoin payment channel technology aimed at scaling the cryptocurrency.  Called “Lightning Loop,” users will now be able to receive bitcoin in increasing quantities without having to close and reopen new payment channels.  Opening a payment channel requires users to pay the same fees and wait the same amount of time as sending a regular bitcoin transaction the blockchain. However, once the payment channel is opened, a user is able to send bitcoin payments almost instantaneously and at a fraction of the cost.  Normally, these payment channels are set up by users with a fixed capacity.  As Lighting Labs developers Alex Bosworth and Bryan Wu described in a blog post:  “Lighting channels are like tubes of money … Money moves around in the tube, but the total amount of funds remains constant. So, unlike other payment systems, Lightning requires ‘inbound capacity’ in order to receive funds.”  With Lightning Loop, this inbound capacity can be withdrawn so that users can keep using the same payment channel to receive bitcoin.  In essence, the Lightning Loop moves funds out of a payment channel and “into a bitcoin wallet, cold storage, or fiat currency via an exchange,” Bosworth and Wu explained in their post. “This emptying of the channel allows [a lighting user] to receive more payments.”  Calling it the “Loop Out” feature, Bosworth and Wu also highlighted that they were currently working on an opposite “Loop In” feature to enable payment channel refills with “on-chain bitcoin from wallets or exchanges.”  “We believe Loop will contribute to the efficiency, scalability, and usability of Lightning. We encourage any Lightning developers, testers, and enthusiasts to begin trying Loop today,"" they added.  Since the alpha release of the tool, Lightning Labs has been receiving positive reception from users with product development director of bitcoin wallet Conio, Marco Pesani, going so far as to tweet:  “Loop from [Lightning Labs] solves one of the biggest lightning network pain points: channels liquidity management … I’ve never seen so many advancement and such focus on the final objective.

Another part of the job is advising clients on legal risks, business strategies and other business issues. The commercial counsel will also structure Facebook's relationships with key partners and the commercial aspects of the products and programs.  The candidate should be able to ""manage numerous deals"" and have a proven lawyer's qualification: a J.D. degree and membership in at least one U.S. state bar are a must.  But the job also requires serious tech expertise: ""5+ years of legal experience, including 4+ years of technology transactions experience,"" particularly with blockchain or payments technology and related legal issues. ""Strong interest in mobile and alternative payments"" is preferred.  Facebook's ambitions related to blockchain-enabled payments have been known for a few months: a February report by the New York Times revealed that the social media giant has been working on a token for payments across the company’s media platforms, which include WhatsApp and Instagram.  According to NYT's sources, the cryptocurrency, expected to be released in the first half of 2019, will be a stablecoin pegged to a basket of several fiat currencies.  Another possible use of the blockchain tech Facebook might be looking at is an integrated identity solution, mentioned by the CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a recently posted video interview with Harvard Law professor Jonathan Zittrain.  “Basically, you take your information, you store it on some decentralized system and you have the choice to log into places without going through an intermediary,” Zuckerberg said.  Further signaling Facebook's interest in this technology, it has posted more than 20 blockchain-related jobs this year.
