36974743,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=372694,1732837536,Vancouver Mayor Proposes a Motion to Make City ‘Bitcoin-Friendly’,"Vancouver Mayor Ken Sim has revealed plans to incorporate Bitcoin (BTC) into the city’s investment portfolio, aiming to position the town as a crypto-friendly hub. This initiative seeks to diversify the city’s financial assets by including Bitcoin on its balance sheet. The Mayor’s Plan During a November 26 Vancouver city council meeting , Sim introduced a notice of motion titled “Preserving the city’s purchasing power through diversification of financial resources: Becoming a Bitcoin-friendly city.” The motion, set to be formally presented on December 11, is part of a broader strategy to modernize Vancouver’s financial framework and mitigate economic risks by leveraging Bitcoin’s growing value. With BTC recently reaching an all-time high of over $98,000, Sim believes incorporating the cryptocurrency into the city’s financial portfolio could provide stability and growth opportunities in the long term. Although the leader has rarely discussed cryptocurrency adoption publicly since taking office in October 2022, his interest in Bitcoin has been evident. During his mayoral campaign, his political party, A Better City, announced that it would accept crypto donations. At the time, Sim said the initiative was a commitment to promoting technology in governance. Furthermore, a copy of the influential book The Bitcoin Standard by Saifedean Ammous, often cited by crypto proponents, was recently spotted in Sim’s office during a Global News interview. A Global Shift Vancouver’s latest initiative to incorporate Bitcoin into its financial portfolio reflects a global shift toward recognizing cryptocurrency as a viable financial hedge. At the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump proposed creating a national Bitcoin reserve. He positioned the cryptocurrency as a strategic asset comparable to gold in the country’s financial system. Other leaders worldwide have also embraced similar ideas. Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado has advocated for Bitcoin’s adoption as a national reserve asset. In a previous interview, she described the asset as a “lifeline” and an essential tool of resistance against her country’s economic turmoil. Canada, where BTC is fully legal and widely embraced, has been at the forefront of cryptocurrency adoption. The nation was the first to approve spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), offering citizens easy access to cryptocurrency investments. The fate of Mayor Ken Sim’s motion remains uncertain as it awaits consideration by the city council. If approved, Vancouver would join a growing list of cities and nations embracing Bitcoin’s potential to enhance financial resilience and drive economic growth.

36974283,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=655407,1732836654,Analyst Maps Out Dogecoin Price Arc To $3 Using A Logarithmic Scale,"Crypto analyst KrissPax has predicted that the Dogecoin price can rally to as high as $3 in this market cycle. The analyst further explained how the foremost meme coin will reach this price target using the Logarithmic scale. Dogecoin Price To Reach $3 In an X post, KrissPax highlighted a path for the Dogecoin price to reach $3. He drew attention to a Dogecoin chart that connects the monthly tops of 2017 and 2021, with an arc representing diminishing returns with a larger market cap, using a logarithmic scale . He suggested that the first step to reaching this $3 target will be for Dogecoin to reach $1. However, the analyst is convinced that the meme coin can reach $3 in this cycle. Based on crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade’s recent analysis, this Dogecoin price rally to $1 could happen soon, putting the rally to $3 in motion. In an X post, the analyst said the Dogecoin Relative Strength Index (RSI) has been bouncing up from the oversold zone on a 4-hour chart. The recent RSI bounces from the same zone caused Dogecoin to surge 40% and 200%. The crypto analyst added that the pump intensity is even getting stronger. In line with this, he remarked that it won’t be surprising if the Dogecoin price spikes beyond the 200% level and rallies above $1.15. Trader Tardigrade also recently predicted that Dogecoin could rise as high as $3.52. This came as he noted how the meme coin always enjoys a 2x increase from previous local tops. Meanwhile, as these crypto analysts have suggested, this $3 target might not be the market top for the Dogecoin price in this market cycle. Crypto analyst Philip recently predicted that Dogecoin could at least reach a conservative target of $5. The analyst made this prediction in relation to DOGE’s performance in previous cycles. Anything Above $5 Is Unrealistic In an X post, crypto analyst Master Kenobi asserted that any chart projecting the Dogecoin price above $5 in this market cycle is unrealistic. He made this claim in relation to what Dogecoin’s market cap would be if it were to reach targets above $5, which he believes cannot happen in this bull run. Master Kenobi warned investors about looking forward to these price targets above $5 as they risk becoming bagholders for another four years. As to how high he believes the Dogecoin price can rise in this cycle , the analyst predicts that the range between $1 and $2 is realistic. He is confident that the rally to $1 could mirror Bitcoin’s rally from $1,000 to $10,000, and the rally to $2 could happen the same way BTC rallied$10,000 to $20,000 in just two weeks. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.4, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",POSITIVE,BTC | DOGE,BTC | BUSINESS | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-price-arc-to-3/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png
36974611,https://thecoinrise.com/late-to-fantom-qubetics-could-be-a-wealth-builder-in-2024/,1732836621,Late to Fantom? Qubetics Could Be a Wealth-Builder in 2024,"The crypto world moves fast, doesn’t it? Just a few years ago, Fantom was the talk of the town, with its blazing transaction speeds and rock-bottom fees. Investors who got in early saw massive returns, leaving latecomers with a bad case of FOMO. But here’s the good news: 2024 isn’t just about looking back; it’s about moving forward. And right now, Qubetics ($TICS) is stepping into the spotlight as the best crypto to buy in November 2024 . While Fantom has made a name for itself in the DeFi space, Qubetics is taking a broader approach, aiming to solve real-world problems with its multi-chain wallet and Web3 aggregator platform. It’s not just about speed or cost; it’s about creating a seamless, interconnected blockchain experience that’s accessible to everyone. Let’s see how these two projects stack up and why Qubetics could be your wealth-builder in 2024. Fantom: A DeFi Powerhouse Fantom is known for being fast. Really fast. Its Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology allows it to process thousands of transactions per second, making it a go-to for DeFi projects that require lightning speeds and low fees. For anyone who’s ever cursed Ethereum’s gas fees, Fantom feels like a breath of fresh air. The Fantom ecosystem is thriving, with major DeFi platforms like SpookySwap and Geist Finance building on its network. It’s also become a hub for innovative projects, including decentralised exchanges and lending platforms. Developers love its scalability and compatibility with Ethereum’s Virtual Machine, which makes transitioning from Ethereum a breeze. Currently trading at $0.30, Fantom has seen better days but remains a solid investment for those looking for steady gains. Analysts predict it could rise to $2 by 2025, offering a decent ROI. But here’s the catch: Fantom’s best days might already be behind it. The explosive growth that early investors enjoyed is unlikely to repeat, leaving latecomers with modest returns at best. Fantom’s tech and ecosystem are impressive, but it’s missing the wow factor that new projects like Qubetics bring to the table. For investors chasing the kind of returns that can change lives, Qubetics offers a more compelling story. Qubetics ($TICS): The Future of Blockchain Interconnectivity If Fantom is all about speed, Qubetics is about versatility. As the world’s first Web3 aggregator, Qubetics is on a mission to unite blockchains and make crypto accessible to everyone. At the heart of its innovation is its multi-chain wallet, a tool designed to simplify crypto management for businesses, developers, and everyday users alike. Qubetics’ multi-chain wallet isn’t just another app; it’s a game-changer. Imagine managing Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Fantom all in one place. No more switching between wallets or worrying about compatibility issues. This wallet streamlines everything, making it easier for users to send, receive, and store assets across multiple blockchains. Let’s break it down. Say you’re a small business owner. With the multi-chain wallet, you can accept payments in various cryptocurrencies without juggling multiple wallets. Or maybe you’re a freelance designer who gets paid in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Instead of struggling to track your payments, you’ve got everything in one place. Even crypto newbies will find it user-friendly, making it the perfect entry point for blockchain beginners. Why Investors Are Flocking to Qubetics The Qubetics presale is making waves for a reason. With over 235 million tokens sold and $3.5 million raised, it’s clear that $TICS is attracting serious attention. At just $0.025 per token, the ROI potential is staggering. Analysts predict $TICS could hit $0.25 by the presale’s end, delivering an 871% return. And if it reaches $15 post-mainnet launch? A $10,000 investment today could turn into $6 million. Those are the kind of numbers that make you sit up and take notice. But Qubetics isn’t just about profits. Its focus on real-world applications, like the multi-chain wallet, ensures it’s a project with staying power. Whether you’re a developer, a business owner, or an everyday user, Qubetics has something to offer. Fantom vs. Qubetics: Which Should You Choose? When it comes to picking between Fantom and Qubetics, the decision boils down to your investment goals. Fantom is a solid, dependable project with a proven track record. But Qubetics? It’s the bold newcomer that’s rewriting the rules. Fantom: The Steady Performer Fantom’s speed and low fees make it a favourite for DeFi projects, and its ecosystem is robust. If you’re looking for a safe, steady investment, Fantom is a great choice. But for those dreaming of explosive returns, it might feel a little too safe. Qubetics: The High-Risk, High-Reward Contender Qubetics isn’t playing it safe, and that’s what makes it exciting. Its focus on interconnectivity and user-friendly tools like the multi-chain wallet sets it apart in a crowded market. For investors willing to take a calculated risk, the potential rewards are astronomical. Why settle for steady when you could aim for spectacular? Conclusion: Don’t Miss Out on Qubetics In the fast-moving world of crypto, opportunities like Qubetics don’t come around often. Fantom has proven itself as a reliable player, but if you’re chasing life-changing returns, Qubetics is the clear choice. Its presale is heating up, and with $TICS still priced at just $0.025, the window to get in early is closing fast. Imagine turning a $10,000 investment into $6 million. That’s not just a dream; it’s a realistic possibility with Qubetics.

36974473,https://cryptonews.com/?p=313838,1732836600,"Japan’s New Prime Minister Reorganizes Web3, Crypto Policy Units","Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has reorganized his party’s web3 and crypto policy-making units. Japan’s CoinPost reported that Masaaki Taira, the new Digital Minister , made a series of related announcements at a forum on November 27. Prime Minister Remains Blockchain-keen? Taira explained that the ruling Liberal Democratic Party will dissolve the existing web3 Project Team (PT), and will instead create a dedicated unit in the party’s Digital Society Promotion department. Akihisa Shiozaki, the former Secretary-General of the web3 PT, will lead the new unit. The government indicated that it has no intention of stopping the “promotion” of web3-related business. The PT was the brainchild of Former Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, who stepped down as PM and the head of the LDP earlier this year. Kishida envisaged web3 and crypto as potential growth engines for the Japanese economy, and promoted the adoption of blockchain technology and NFTs . Ishiba has indicated that he also favors pro-web3 policies, and Taira – also the former head of the web3 PT – has also spoken about the need to reform Japan’s crypto tax laws. #PMinAction : On November 26, 2024, Prime Minister Ishiba held the 14th meeting of the Council on Economic and Fiscal Policy in FY2024 at the Prime Minister's Office. https://t.co/q4w2MyKYtA — PM's Office of Japan (@JPN_PMO) November 27, 2024 Minister Favors Tax Reform Taira also pioneered the launch of crypto regulations, and worked on key legislation during the Kishida administration. CoinPost noted that Shiozaki’s X (Twitter) profile has been updated since the reshuffle, but noted that references to “web3 policy” had not been removed. The government has yet to outline the full responsibilities of the Digital Society Promotion department. However, crypto advocates will likely welcome Shiozaki’s continued involvement. Under Shiozaki’s leadership, the PT published white papers calling for “immediate” tax reform. He has also focused on promoting Japanese Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), with an emphasis on fostering institutional support. Why global hedge funds and private equity firms are piling into Japan’s $165 billion hidden property trade. The potential for unrealized gains stems from an accounting quirk https://t.co/av1VkNepn7 — Bloomberg (@business) November 28, 2024 Shiozaki and others also once called on the Kishida government to appoint a Japanese “Minister for web3.” Local Revitalization Projects As previously reported , Ishiba’s election manifesto included sections on the use of blockchain technology and NFTs in regional development projects. The document explained: “Using blockchain technology, NFTs, and more, we will look to maximize the value of a multitude of analog local products, such as food and tourism experiences. We will do this by restoring their value to global prices.” Ishiba’s LDP retained control of parliament in the general election held on October 27 this year. The party has been in power since 1955, with the exception of two short spells in opposition: between 1993 and 1994, and 2009-2012.

In a new thread on the social media platform X, ImmuneFi says that the crypto markets have seen an overall decrease in fraudulent activity compared to a year ago, suggesting that crypto is getting safer overall. “Is crypto getting safer? The ecosystem has lost $1.48 billion to hackers and rug pullers YTD (year-to-date) – a 15% decrease compared to $1.7 billion during the same period last year. The decrease is also noticeable on a month-over-month basis.” According to ImmuneFi, even though November saw over $71 million stolen by hackers and rug pullers, the number pales in comparison to the amount stolen last year. “In November 2024, we saw total losses of $71 million, the second-lowest monthly loss this year. Looking at the same period last year, over $343 million was lost.” In its Crypto Losses in November 2024 report, ImmuneFi notes that bad actors targeted the BNB Chain, the blockchain of the world’s largest crypto exchange by volume, the most. According to the data, leading smart contract platforms Ethereum ( ETH ) and Solana ( SOL ) and layer-1 blockchain Avalanche ( AVAX ) were impacted as well. “BNB Chain suffered 14 individual attacks, representing 46.7% of the total losses across targeted chains. Ethereum experienced 9 incidents, representing 30% of the total. Solana, Polygon, Fantom, Avalanche, Arbitrum, and Aptos each experienced one incident, accounting for 3.3%, respectively.” ImmuneFi concludes by noting that investors shouldn’t quite celebrate the dip in numbers as bad actors are increasingly targeting centralized exchange platforms, which tend to get hit harder by hacks.

Pink Shiba Inu (PINKSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PINKSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pink Shiba Inu can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pink Shiba Inu could become the next viral memecoin. Pink Shiba Inu launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pink Shiba Inu on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pink Shiba Inu by entering its contract address – 6cPu1KvERtjkPK8RuiwpjpTZ4kYfY5KzrG48d5wyD2XX – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PINKSHIB.

A recent report from Standard Chartered’s Geoff Kendrick and Zodia Markets’ Nick Philpott painted a compelling picture for the future. The financial analysts suggested that stablecoins could grow to represent 10% of the U.S. M2 transactions. Kendrick and Philpott mentioned that Stablecoins are poised to become a cornerstone of global finance. Can Stablecoins Hold 10% of the U.S. Money Supply? The tokens are digital currencies pegged to traditional assets like the U.S. dollar, represent a small slice of the financial pie. The asset class accounts for just 1% of U.S. M2 transactions, a measure of the money supply that includes cash, checking deposits, and easily convertible assets. Yet Kendrick and Philpott believe this is just the beginning. The analysts predicted that stablecoins could soon handle up to 10% of U.S. M2 and foreign exchange (FX) transactions. They highlighted that growing regulatory clarity and a clear demand for alternatives to outdated financial systems could fuel the growth. The Biden administration took initial steps toward regulating stablecoins, but progress stalled. The analysts say the incoming Trump administration might take a more aggressive approach to establishing a framework that encourages the tokens’ growth. Stablecoins Revolutionizes Outdated Financial Systems Global financial systems like SWIFT and correspondent banking are plagued by inefficiencies, with high fees, delays, and limited transparency. These systems often operate on a first-come, first-served basis, leaving customers unsure about costs and timelines. In contrast, stablecoins offer a decentralized alternative that enables direct, transparent, and cost-effective settlements. This makes them an attractive solution for payments and remittances, especially in regions where traditional banking is less accessible. Gaining Ground as a Global Financial Powerhouse Stablecoins are increasingly transforming financial behavior in emerging markets like Brazil, Turkey, Nigeria, India, and Indonesia. In these regions, many users turn to stablecoins to protect against local currency volatility, make payments, and facilitate cross-border transfers. This is largely due to the ability to hold tokenized versions of stable currencies, such as the U.S. dollar, This provides an alternative to traditional banking systems, which can often be unreliable or inaccessible. Beyond these markets, stablecoins are also gaining traction in areas like payroll, trade settlements, and high-yield financial products. With their market capitalization reaching $190 billion, stablecoins are solidifying their position as major players in the digital asset space. Notably, fiat-backed coins like Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC dominate this market.

Have you ever regretted missing out on Bitcoin’s early days or Shiba Inu’s explosive rally? The crypto world thrives on opportunities that promise big returns, especially in the meme coin space. With viral appeal and community-driven growth, meme coins have gone from being a joke to serious contenders in the market. While Floki Inu (FLOKI) and Dogwifhat (WIF ) have captured attention recently, BTFD Coin (BTFD) is emerging as the next big thing with its revolutionary presale and exciting ecosystem features. In this article, we’ll explore why BTFD Coin is shaking up the scene and how it stacks up against popular meme coins like Floki Inu and Dogwifhat. If you’re hunting for the best meme coins to invest in for short term, buckle up—this is your guide to making your next move. BTFD Coin: Seizing the Moment in the Meme Coin Revolution Picture this: You’re scrolling through crypto news, and everyone’s raving about the next potential moonshot. This is BTFD Coin —a project with a name that’s more than just catchy. Inspired by the legendary trading mantra “Buy The Dip,” BTFD isn’t just another meme coin; it’s a movement designed for traders who thrive on timing and conviction. The BTFD Coin presale is currently in its fourth stage, offering a once-in-a-lifetime chance to join early. With over 8.5 billion coins sold, the presale has already raised an impressive $220,000 from 700+ holders. What’s more, you can grab $BTFD for just $0.000038 right now, before the price surges to $0.0006 at the presale’s end. That’s a staggering 15x return or a 1,478.9% ROI for those who get in early. For instance, a $200 investment at the current price could fetch you 5,263,157 BTFD coins. When the price hits $0.0006, your $200 could skyrocket to $3,157.89—talk about a game-changer! BTFD isn’t just about numbers, though. Built on Ethereum’s robust infrastructure, this token boasts staking rewards of up to 90% APY, a highly anticipated P2E game, and a community-driven mission to dominate the next bull cycle. Whether you’re an Ethereum enthusiast or a first-time trader, BTFD’s roadmap and features are tailored to turn every dip into an opportunity. As the presale accelerates, it’s clear that this meme coin is setting the stage for something massive. For those seeking the best meme coins to invest in for short term, BTFD is undoubtedly a frontrunner. Floki Inu: Navigating Delays but Staying Relevant Floki Inu has been a crowd favourite for its ambitious plans to merge crypto with the metaverse. However, recent updates reveal that its metaverse game launch has been delayed until after Q1 2025. While delays can be frustrating, the decision to refine the platform with recommendations from security experts like Hacken and OpenZeppelin underscores Floki Inu’s commitment to user safety and functionality. This $60 million-backed project has been under development for three years, promising to redefine the play-to-earn ecosystem. Despite the delay, Floki Inu has maintained market relevance, recently gaining visibility with a Coinbase listing. However, the token has seen a price dip of 9.93% in the last 24 hours and 13.28% over the past week, currently trading at IDR 3.41 ($0.0000216). While these numbers might seem discouraging, Floki Inu’s long-term potential remains intact. Its dedication to quality and innovation suggests that its metaverse game could be a game-changer, making it a coin to watch for strategic investors aiming for the best meme coins to invest in for short term. Dogwifhat (WIF): Steady Consolidation Amid Market Volatility Dogwifhat, the rising star of Solana’s meme coin ecosystem, has proven its resilience in the face of market downturns. Currently consolidating within the golden Fibonacci retracement zone of $3.02 to $3.37, WIF has captured the attention of whales and retail traders alike. On-chain data reveals that $62.23 million worth of WIF tokens has been withdrawn from exchanges by whales, signalling strong confidence and a potential price rally. Although Open Interest has declined by 6% due to prolonged consolidation, technical indicators paint a bullish picture. With a Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 50.56, WIF is neither overbought nor oversold, leaving ample room for upward movement. Analysts predict that if WIF holds above $3, it could surge by 60%, hitting $4.90 in the near term. Dogwifhat’s ability to maintain stability while attracting whale activity makes it a compelling choice for short-term investors looking for the best meme coins to invest in for short term amidst market fluctuations. Why BTFD Coin Is Your Best Bet Right Now While Floki Inu and Dogwifhat have their strengths, BTFD Coin’s unique blend of innovation, community focus, and presale accessibility sets it apart.

36971525,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=655349,1732831252,Analyst Sees Double-Digit XRP Price—The Catch? Recapturing 2017 BTC Peak,"Experts are thrilled about the chances that XRP, the cryptocurrency linked to Ripple, will hit new heights. Recent trends show that it could reach $20 if it can regain its 2017 high against Bitcoin. This hopeful prediction is based on the fact that the altcoin has shown strong signs of recovery, having come back from a low point of $1.28 earlier this week. XRP’s Most Recent Performance XRP swiftly recovered from that low point, surpassing critical psychological levels at $1.3 and $1.4, and is currently pursuing a stable position above $1.5. The current market rally has led analysts to believe that the crypto asset may outperform Bitcoin due to its upward momentum. Crypto analyst CryptoBull has been particularly vocal about this potential, stating that if XRP can reclaim its 2017 peak against Bitcoin, the price could skyrocket to $20. Analyzing the #XRP price in Dollars vs Bitcoin shows us how early we are in this bullrun. We are still 1,500% behind in Bitcoin value compared to early 2017. If we meet the same Bitcoin value $XRP price will be around $20. pic.twitter.com/ofxd6Izv5g — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) November 26, 2024 XRP has faced great difficulties in its competitiveness with Bitcoin since its all-time top of $3.31 in January 2018. The value of the cryptocurrency in respect to BTC has been dropping over recent months. Still, new data shows XRP has surged by an amazing 111% against Bitcoin this month, implying a possible breakout is about ready. Resistance Levels Broken In order for XRP to maintain its upward trajectory, it must overcome substantial resistance levels. In an effort to conclude the month above the descending trendline that has plagued XRP since July of last year, analysts are closely monitoring the price action. If successful, this could presage additional gains and corroborate a bullish breakout. The current trading value of the altcoin against Bitcoin stands at about 0.00001544 BTC and still remains much lower than it reached at its historical high. CryptoBull still sees hope, though, and believes a similar rally to that of the early 2017 market might send XRP right back into double digits. XRP: Predictions And Market Sentiment The broader cryptocurrency industry is also seeing a comeback while Bitcoin tries to break past the $95,000 level. Analysts believe that if XRP can turn the important $2 resistance level into support, then a fast climb towards $20 might be started. Apart from these technical factors, regulatory optimism also plays a role in how the market shapes its sentiment. The upcoming resignation of the SEC Chair, Gary Gensler, can lead to better regulatory conditions for cryptocurrencies like XRP, which further boosts the euphoria surrounding Ripple’s prospect. XRP is currently trading at approximately $1.47, which represents a 7% increase in the past 24 hours. Many investors are closely monitoring the altcoin as it navigates this critical phase of its market voyage, as analysts anticipate that bullish momentum will persist.

36971559,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=619731,1732830612,Switzerland passes bill to study Bitcoin effect on utilizing excess energy,"The Swiss canton of Bern passed legislation to study Bitcoin mining as a tool for tapping excess electric energy. The legislation, proposed by a pro-crypto parliamentary group in March, has now been passed with a majority. The Canton of Bern, Switzerland, approved a proposal to study Bitcoin mining as a tool for redirecting excess grid energy. The proposal was submitted in March by a group of 23 representatives of the Parliamentary Group Bitcoin. The 160-member local parliament ended up voting in favor of the bill after months of discussions. Bern aims to become an attractive location for mining companies, modeling itself after similar mining-friendly regions. The legislation takes into account other countries and regions that have tapped Bitcoin mining as a way to use various forms of excess generation. The bill requires the local canton government to study the availability of excess electricity production and how Bitcoin mining can utilize that surplus. The bill passed despite the local government’s attempt to prevent its implementation. The Bern government council stated that Bitcoin energy consumption was a globalized issue and did not pertain to Bern’s energy grid. The other concern was that no government or central bank could track or control the issuance of BTC, since the coin is not legal tender in the country. However, Bitcoin mining facilities are increasingly local, seeking specific energy production regions and the right climate for easier cooling of the mining rigs. Switzerland already redirects 3.6% of its energy to general data centers. Despite the backlash to the bill, it was approved with a large majority. As a result, the local government will have to produce a report on the available excess energy in the canton of Bern. The report would point to how Bitcoin mining can stabilize the grid, working in cooperation with local mining companies. Switzerland has good local conditions for mining centers Switzerland is not only friendly to the financial side of crypto, and home to some of the biggest crypto organizations. The country is in the top 10 territories based on Bitcoin node availability. Nodes are usually run by mining operations or experienced users, due to their memory-intensive technology. Switzerland hosts a total of 971 nodes, ranked ninth among the top countries. The nodes represent 2% of the Bitcoin network. In Europe, Switzerland is the fifth largest node host, after Germany, France, Netherlands, and the UK. The Linthal mining operation, moved from its initial location in Zurich, is one of the world’s biggest farms. The farm has operated since 2016, becoming one of the first large-scale facilities, even before the mass awareness of BTC. Switzerland is host to multiple modern mining centers. However, mining farms are less demanding and do not require warranted uptime. Farms can be switched on and off depending on the price of electricity and overall market conditions. Additionally, Switzerland has a dominance of hydroelectric power, one of the preferred and clean sources for Bitcoin mining. Up to 62% of the country’s generation comes from its mountainous terrain and rivers. Hydroelectric power has been used in combination with a cool climate to create mining operations worldwide. Switzerland is nearly self-sufficient and may spot small excesses, enough to run medium-range mining operations. Facilities of 50-80MW are spreading worldwide, as investors seek secure and relatively cheap power sources. Regarding its generation mix with, a prevalence of hydroelectric power, Switzerland has a similar profile to Bhutan , one of the countries that chose government-controlled mining operations. Bitcoin miners have also thrived with other available excess energy sources. Those include gas flares and geothermal power from volcanoes. Bitcoin’s global usage is higher than the consumption of Finland. Recently, the growth of power for mining operations has slowed down, as machines and cooling have become more efficient.

BONK and Dogecoin Lag","Elon MAGA could turn early investors into multi-millionaires, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) did. Elon MAGA (ELONMAGA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONMAGA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon MAGA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon MAGA could become the next viral memecoin. Elon MAGA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon MAGA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon MAGA by entering its contract address – 7aemsYDqBWz1vyyDQqMwMkvSa4xgyFYVc5NnrPecL6iX – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONMAGA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB | BONK,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL | BONK,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/elon-maga-solana-memecoin-to-surge-18000-before-exchange-listing-as-shib-bonk-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

This surge is the exchange’s cumulative performance across several Ethereum Layer-2 solutions, such as Arbitrum, Base, and Polygon. November’s performance outdid the previous record of $34 billion in March 2024. The decentralized cryptocurrency exchange ’s monthly volume spiked by almost 50% from $20.32 billion in October 2024. Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution Arbitrum contributed the lion’s share of Uniswap’s performance. Arbitrum saw $19.5 billion in Uniswap trading volume. Base and Polygon followed with $9.19 billion and $4.33 billion, respectively. The three platforms are known for their scalability and cost-effectiveness, thus attracting many activities. Uniswap becomes a top fee producer, beating other top platforms According to data from DeFi Llama, Uniswap ranks sixth among protocols in terms of fees and revenue. The decentralized finance platform’s fees rose to $5.44 million on all platforms. While it trails slightly behind Solana, the exchange outpaces major protocols such as Tron, Maker, and the meme coin marketplace Pump.fun. Henrik Andersson, the chief investment officer at Apollo Crypto, noted that volumes for Uniswap on Ethereum layer 2s could be traced back to an increased demand for assets and stablecoins in the broader DeFi ecosystem. “[This is] in line with the DeFi renaissance and the recent increase in ETH/BTC. Onchain yields are also rising. ~ Henrik Andersson UNI, Uniswap’s native token, has also been riding high. In the past 24 hours, the token has seen 10% growth. UNI currently trades at $12.74 and has cumulatively gained up to 44.78% in the past week. UNI has maintained a market cap of $7.7 billion, becoming the 26th largest crypto. Resurgence in decentralized finance is suitable for blockchain Uniswap’s performance also indicates DeFi’s growth potential. The performance of various blockchains like Solana makes it easy to predict DeFi’s re-emergence. Solana also had an outstanding November performance as the token scaled new heights. Solana’s November monthly decentralized exchange trading volume also broke its record-high by reaching $109.73 billion. Solana’s monthly DEX volume surged over 50% compared to last month’s $52.49 billion monthly volume.

To read full editions, subscribe . Continuing a recent trend of Solana projects marching into mobile, the trading data aggregation platform Birdeye has launched a mobile version, the team told Lightspeed exclusively. The app — which supports Solana, Sui, and EVM chains — will let users track trades, price swings, and trending tokens. There’s also a swap interface provided by Jupiter, which requires users to trade tokens on a browser pop-up in its first iteration. Swaps will only be available on Android initially, as Apple requires transactions to happen in-app (presumably so it can take its famous 30% cut). Gaining traction on the app could help Birdeye grow its revenue from swap fees as well as scale up its paid subscription service. In a world where tens of thousands of new Solana tokens are being launched daily, data aggregation platforms like Birdeye have found some product market fit. DEX Screener is another popular memecoin-integrated data platform with a mobile app. Lan Boi Vu, marketing manager at Birdeye, told me the app is different from DEX Screener’s because Birdeye was built “from scratch” rather than as a downsized version of the website. Interestingly, Boi Vu said the built-in notification system — which pushes alerts about large price movements or trades from specific wallets — was likely the app’s most important feature. Birdeye brings in some revenue from PRO, a souped-up version of its data platform starting at $30 per month. Boi Vu declined to disclose how many subscribers the service has. Birdeye also sells expedited updates for token information like logos and social media links. (DEX Screener offers a version of this paid update service as well.) Plus, it charges an estimated “0.3% or 0.4%” combined fee on swaps made through Jupiter and 1inch, Boi Vu said. This doesn’t account for network congestion. Birdeye also has a data services branch that counts DeFi outfits, including Jupiter, as customers. That part of the company is “very lucrative,” Boi Vu said. It’s the latest mobile app to join the app store. Jupiter, Cube Exchange, and DRiP are other Solana projects who either just released or are gearing up to release apps. Boi Vu pointed out that multiple apps coming to market around the same time could make “not just Solana, but the entire Web3 community a lot more interconnected.” Updated Dec. 4, 2024 at 7:30 pm ET: Clarified details regarding swap fees and removed the erroneous claim that Uniswap is a Birdeye Data Services customer .

One of Ethereum’s original co-founders, Jeffrey Wilcke, recently transferred a colossal Ethereum (ETH) to Kraken, a leading U.S.-based crypto exchange. The analytics account Spot on Chain reported this transaction, worth about $72.5 million . Ethereum Co-Founders’ Funding Moves The transaction occurred earlier today and sent shockwaves through the crypto community. Jeffrey Wilcke, a key player in Ethereum’s creation, transferred 20,000 Ethereum, equivalent to a staggering $72.5 million, onto the Kraken exchange. Wilcke’s recent transaction is not his first major Ethereum sale this year. According to Spot On Chain , the Ethereum co-founder has sold 44,300 Ethereum, worth $148 million at an average price of $3,342 per coin. Jeffrey Wilcke, #Ethereum co-founder, deposited 20,000 $ETH ($72.5M) to #Kraken 30 minutes ago, just as $ETH made a strong comeback today! This is the fourth time he unloaded $ETH in 2024, totaling 44,300 $ETH ($148M) at an average price of $3,342. Follow @spotonchain now and… https://t.co/zriXX9jbKD pic.twitter.com/iDEeptqrKI — Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) November 28, 2024 Notably, each of Wilcke’s sales in 2024 has preceded a significant price surge, suggesting a potential psychological or market trend tied to his transactions. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s popular co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, is making waves for different reasons. Earlier this week, Buterin transferred 340 Ethereum valued at over $1 million. Coin Center, a nonprofit organization focused on cryptocurrency policy, received the transfer. Known for converting memecoin donations into Ethereum , Buterin channels these funds into promising projects, further cementing his philanthropic reputation. Ethereum’s Price Shows Resilience What is particularly interesting is the timing of Wilcke’s sales. As he offloads Ethereum, the price of the asset tends to surge. On the day of his latest transaction, Ethereum experienced a remarkable 8% spike , reaching as high as $3,688. However, after the surge, the price pulled back slightly, shedding 2.07%, and is currently priced around $3,615. This trend is in line with previous sales by Wilcke; a significant uptick has followed each sale in Ethereum’s price. This correlation raises intriguing questions about the relationship between Wilcke’s actions and Ethereum’s market trajectory. Ethereum community speculates if his massive transfers are driving the bullish trend or if they coincidentally align with broader market forces. Profitability of ETH Holders at a Half-Year High While Wilcke’s Ethereum movement garnered attention, another key piece of data highlights Ethereum’s positive market sentiment. According to a recent report, 90.8% of Ethereum holders have reached their highest level of profitability This marks a significant milestone, suggesting that most Ethereum holders enjoy profitable returns at current price levels. The rising holder profitability and recent price surges indicate a potentially bullish outlook for Ethereum in the coming months. While market fluctuations are always a factor, the strong profitability among holders could indicate growing confidence in ETH’s long-term prospects.

This speculation is caused by RNDR’s bullish price action pattern, significant participation from traders and investors, and overall positive market sentiment. Render (RDNR) Technical Analysis and Upcoming level According to CoinPedia’s technical analysis, RNDR recently broke out of a bullish double-bottom price action pattern and is now targeting the next resistance level at $10.

Bullish On-Chain Metrics In addition to technical analysis, traders have shown a strong interest and confidence in RNDR, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . According to the data, RNDR’s open interest (OI) has surged by 29% in the past 24 hours and 12.8% in the past four hours.

Qubetics Is Here to Change Your Mind,"Ever wondered why some people seem to turn small crypto investments into life-changing wealth? Back in the day, many overlooked projects like Ripple (XRP) during their ICO phases, only to see them soar. Stories of early investors turning tiny sums into massive returns are common, leaving those who missed out filled with regret. But the crypto market is all about second chances, and missing one opportunity doesn’t mean you’ve missed them all. A groundbreaking blockchain project, “ Qubetics ($TICS) ,” currently in its 10th presale stage is here to give you another chance. With unique applications like a multi-chain wallet, it is setting a new standard for cryptocurrency. Designed to tackle real-life challenges, Qubetics is a fresh opportunity for those who missed earlier ICOs and want to make up for lost chances. Its ongoing presale offers $TICS tokens at just $0.025, a price predicted to skyrocket. If the phrase “best cryptos to buy this week” resonates with you, Qubetics should undoubtedly be on your radar. Why Qubetics Multi-Chain Wallet and Presale Are Transforming the Crypto Investment Game Qubetics isn’t just another name in the crypto world; it’s a game-changer with real-world applications. One of its standout features is the multi-chain wallet , designed for individuals and businesses seeking efficiency and security. Imagine a freelancer juggling payments from clients across borders or a retailer managing multi-currency transactions. The Qubetics wallet simplifies such complexities by integrating seamless crypto payments and even providing options for virtual and debit cards. This wallet supports Apple Pay and Google Pay, making it perfect for tech-savvy millennials and Gen Z users. Plans to partner with Visa and Mastercard further enhance its usability. Picture this: a business owner in California using Qubetics to pay overseas suppliers in seconds, bypassing the delays and fees of traditional banking systems. Beyond practicality, the Qubetics presale is a window of opportunity that savvy investors cannot ignore. Over 231 million tokens have been sold, raising more than $3.5 million. Analysts predict jaw-dropping returns, with $TICS expected to hit $0.25 at the presale’s end, offering an ROI of 871%. When the token reaches $1, early investors could see a 3787% return, and at $15 post-mainnet launch, that return could shoot to 58,213%. For example, an investment of $560,000 in $TICS tokens at $0.025 would secure 22.4 million tokens. At $15 per token, this investment would grow to an astonishing $336 million. Numbers like these make it clear why Qubetics is one of the best cryptos to buy this week. Ripple’s Journey from a Modest ICO to a Crypto Giant Ripple (XRP) is one of the most well-known success stories in the crypto world, but not everyone saw its potential early on. During its ICO, Ripple tokens were offered at just fractions of a cent, and many dismissed it as just another blockchain project. Today, Ripple has cemented its place as a top player in cross-border payment solutions, making early investors wealthier than they ever imagined. Ripple’s journey has been marked by significant milestones, including partnerships with financial institutions and advancements in blockchain technology. Its ability to process thousands of transactions per second at a low cost revolutionized global payments, proving the critics wrong. Had you invested even a small amount during its ICO, the returns could’ve been extraordinary. Ripple’s success teaches an important lesson: betting on promising projects early can pay off big. Qubetics offers a similar opportunity today, with its presale shaping up to be one of the best cryptos to buy this week . Unlike Ripple’s early days, where many overlooked its potential, Qubetics is grabbing attention right out of the gate. Conclusion In the world of cryptocurrency, missed opportunities can be hard to forget. Ripple proved that early investments could yield life-changing returns, but not everyone seized the moment. With Qubetics, a new door has opened. Its multi-chain wallet, seamless payment integrations, and potential for exponential ROI make it a standout project. The Qubetics presale is still in its 10th stage, with $TICS tokens available at $0.025. Waiting too long could mean missing out again. With predictions pointing to massive gains, Qubetics is a rare chance to enter the market early and maximise your potential returns. Don’t let another opportunity slip through your fingers. Check out Qubetics now—one of the best cryptos to buy this week—and take the first step toward transforming your financial future.

Shiba Inu (SHIB): An Ethereum-Based Memecoin with Growing Utility Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a memecoin inspired by Dogecoin, but it runs on the Ethereum blockchain. This allows SHIB to work with Ethereum-based applications. Launched in August 2020 by an anonymous developer named Ryoshi, SHIB started with a quadrillion tokens. Half were sent to Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin. He donated a significant portion to the India Covid Relief Fund and burned 40% of the total supply, which increased SHIB’s profile. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB’s Ethereum integration enables projects like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange. There are plans for a future NFT platform and a governance system. These developments could enhance SHIB’s utility. In the current market cycle, SHIB’s potential in decentralized finance and NFTs may attract interest. Conclusion While SHIB and others show less short-term potential, DOGEN stands out. Designed for those seeking luxury and success, it promises high growth.

Will Trump’s SEC Close XRP Lawsuit? During a recent interview at Fox Business , Giancarlo, who is affectionately known as “Crypto Dad”, said he would recommend regulatory agencies drop the vast majority of crypto cases where they have lost in the trial courts. When asked whether he thinks the SEC will toss out its XRP case, he stated: “I think they should drop the XRP case. I would think that they will.” ""Crypto Dad"" @giancarloMKTS , Says he believes the SEC should drop the case against @Ripple and believes they Will. pic.twitter.com/elans7a7Ad — 𝗕𝗮𝗻𝗸XRP (@BankXRP) November 27, 2024 While XRP has been one of the top cryptocurrencies by market cap since it went live in 2013, the SEC alleged the asset is a security in a lawsuit brought in 2020. Even though a New York judge had declared in July 2023 that the token is “not necessarily a security on its face,” a sense of regulatory uncertainty lingered, with the SEC appealing the decision in October. SEC Chairman Gary Gensler announced recently that he intends to step down from his role on January 20th. With a change in SEC leadership likely to bring about a crypto-friendly regime, many believe the Commission is not going to continue with the lawsuit. With the likelihood of a favorable resolution of the case and the potential for a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment under Trump’s administration, confidence in XRP is growing. Investors are awakening to this potential, spurring the current excitement and upward price momentum. As of this writing, XRP’s price has increased 9.6% over the past day, with the asset trading at $1.49. Current SEC’s War On Crypto Besides Ripple, the SEC under Gary Gensler has also lodged enforcement actions against a raft of other prominent companies the likes of Coinbase , Binance , Kraken , OpenSea , Consensys , and Robinhood . It’s worth mentioning that Ripple’s top legal head, Stuart Alderoty, recently called on the next SEC boss to drop all non-fraud crypto cases on the first day of office. Meanwhile, Giancarlo recently clarified that he is not in the race to replace Gensler despite rumors claiming he was seeking the agency’s top job.

Hoskinson says Bitcoin could skyrocket by up to 436% from the current level within two years. According to the Cardano founder, Bitcoin’s surge will be fueled by growing demand. “It is my belief that Bitcoin is going to go to $250,000 to $500,000 within the next 12 to 24 months because of the investment inflows and the great interest that has been achieved. This will translate to an ecosystem whose value is starting to approach that of gold, an asset humans have used as a store of value for over 5,000 years. Simply put, Bitcoin is the store of value for the internet and it will remain in that role for the foreseeable future.” The Cardano founder says that governments and decentralized finance (DeFi) on Bitcoin could further serve as catalysts of demand for Bitcoin. “It basically means that you can create a DeFi layer for Bitcoin and pay transaction fees in Bitcoin… [with the taproot upgrade] Bitcoin went from a sleeping-giant-never-to-awaken in innovation coma to an awakened giant that is four times the size of Solana and Ethereum combined. Reality is that should these floodgates open, it is my belief that DeFi in the Bitcoin ecosystem will eclipse DeFi in all ecosystems in the cryptocurrency industry within 24 months to 36 months. And that’s just because of scale and liquidity. As good as Ethereum can be, and Solana can be, and Cardano can be… let’s be intellectually honest about this, governments are talking about a strategic reserve of Bitcoin and Bitcoin alone. It’s their entry point.” Bitcoin’s taproot upgrade, which was designed to enhance the crypto asset’s smart contract capabilities and efficiency, was activated in November of 2021.

According to CryptoCon, this date holds historical significance as the anniversary of Bitcoin's first halving and serves as a crucial marker for Bitcoin's market cycles. The company introduced its “November 28 Cycles Theory,” now renamed the “Half-Cycles Theory,” in January 2023. The theory suggests that Bitcoin’s price movements and market cycles are centered around this date, predicting bottoms, tops, and key transition phases with remarkable accuracy. CryptoCon’s theory has been consistent with Bitcoin’s price performance so far. He correctly identified the market bottom at $15,500 in January 2023, predicting that 2023, the “Green Year,” would have the best buying opportunities and a climb to the median price of $34,500. Bitcoin met that target, confirming the first stage of the theory. Related News: Will Ethereum Continue Its Rise Towards Its ATH? Here's Analysts' Prediction The theory for 2024, dubbed the “Blue Year,” had been that it would be steadily preparing for a new all-time high (ATH), with a significant advance expected towards the end of the year. According to CryptoCon, Bitcoin is already preparing to finish the year as expected, paving the way for what it calls the “Red Year.” According to the analytics firm, the “Red Year” that will begin in 2025 is set to deliver Bitcoin’s long-awaited even higher ATHs. CryptoCon predicts that Bitcoin’s next cycle top will occur within a 21-day period starting on November 28, 2025, mirroring the timing of previous market tops and bottoms. The theory suggests that Bitcoin’s 4-year cycle, which is often discussed in the crypto community, is not only alive but also gaining strength. While some critics argue that Bitcoin’s 4-year cycle has become less important as the market matures, CryptoCon strongly disagrees. “A lot of people are waiting for the 4-year cycle to die, but this cycle is stronger than ever,” the firm said. *This is not investment advice.

36968882,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=655400,1732825804,Crypto Expert Unveils 15 Surprising Truths About This Bull Run You Need To Know,"In a thread on X, crypto researcher Alex Wacy (@wacy_time1) shared 15 eye-opening insights about the current bull cycle with his 183,000 followers. Wacy’s analysis covers a range of topics from Bitcoin dynamics to emerging technologies like AI and DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks). Here’s a detailed look at his revelations. #1 Bitcoin Season Is Memecoin Season “When Bitcoin rises, people often buy memecoins en masse, which positively affects their prices,” Wacy observed. In contrast to the previous bull run, capital flows directly in the most high-risk sector of crypto. The surge in Bitcoin’s price tends to trigger a ripple effect in the memecoin market, leading to significant price appreciations for these tokens, leaving out more fundamentally strong altcoins. #2 Long-Term Bitcoin Holders Are Selling Aggressively Wacy highlighted a notable sell-off among long-term Bitcoin holders. “They have already sold nearly 730,000 BTC over the month,” he noted. Interestingly, US spot ETFs are absorbing about 90% of this selling pressure, playing a crucial role in stabilizing the market. #3 Solana Above $500 May Be A Reality “Even when the memecoin era comes to an end, AI and DePIN projects’ developers continue to opt for Solana,” Wacy pointed out. With the massive attention on memecoins, AI, and DePIN narratives, Solana is still the leading ecosystem which will eventually push SOL’s price above $500. #4 Blockchain-Based AI Agents Are Still Undervalued “AI agents are already making their mark in the real world. However, AI built on blockchain offers greater decentralization and privacy,” Wacy stated. He suggests that blockchain-based AI projects have untapped potential and are currently undervalued in the market. #5 Ethereum Is Set to Rise Ethereum’s open interest has surpassed its previous all-time high, exceeding $13 billion—a growth of over 40% in the last four months. This surge indicates increased investor interest and could signal a significant upward movement in Ethereum’s price. “Ethereum is set to rise,” Wacy predicts. #6 Most Ethereum Layer 2s Will Fail Wacy expresses skepticism about the proliferation of Ethereum Layer 2 solutions. “The most promising L2s at the moment are Base and Mantle,” he commented. He warned that unless the Ethereum Foundation develops “a concept of L2 hubs,” 90% of L2 chains might not survive the next bear cycle. #7 Trendy Technologies Will Succeed “AI, DePIN, and RWA are the future. At least that’s how retail sees it, so keep an eye on these trends,” Wacy advised. According to him, investor’s core capital should only be invested in these three most powerful narratives in the ongoing bull run. #8 Non-Key Narratives Are Great For Speculation Wacy highlights the speculative potential in less mainstream sectors like Decentralized Science (DeSci). “While it may be less popular, it has been and will continue to be well-pumped,” he remarked, indicating opportunities for more high-risk averse investors. #9 Quantum Crypto Is Gaining Attention “Quantum stocks have surged over 1000% in just one month,” Wacy noted. He suggests that investors should monitor quantum-related crypto projects, as this sector may experience significant growth in the upcoming months. #10 Exercise Caution With Market Sentiment “Take what people say here with a grain of salt. They’re often too bearish during dumps and too bullish during pumps,” Wacy warned. He recommends critical analysis of market sentiment indicators, which can be misleading during extreme market conditions. #11 Timing Is Crucial For Offloading Altcoins “When you consider offloading your altcoins and everyone labels you an absolute idiot, that’s your cue for the best moment to cash out,” Wacy suggested. Contrarian strategies might offer optimal exit points for altcoin investors. #12 Valuing Insights From Crypto Analyst Cobie “I think Cobie knows something a little more about this market than we do,” Wacy said, referring to well-known crypto analyst Cobie (@cobie). He advises listening to Cobie’s who famously stated earlier in this crypto bull run that investors should focus 70% of their capital in cat themed memecoins, 20% in other animal memecoins and only 10% in all other coins for maximum profit. #13 Traditional Market Rules Still Apply “Even though this cycle differs greatly from previous ones, altcoin growth remains heavily reliant on Bitcoin dominance,” Wacy observed. Despite new market dynamics, Bitcoin continues to be the most important influence over the broader crypto market. #14 Market Cycles Remain Unchanged “The market is a cycle. Today it’s memes, tomorrow it’s technology, and the day after, regulations. Cycles have never been canceled. Remember that,” Wacy emphasized. Understanding the cyclical nature of markets can help investors navigate volatility. #15 Strategic Investment Considerations “Some people might benefit more from seeking dips in alpha plays, rather than attempting to catch another risky beta play. Reflect on it,” Wacy concluded. He encourages investors to focus on high-quality investments with strong fundamentals instead of chasing high-risk opportunities.

36969449,https://blockworks.co/news/fomc-november-bank-reserve-liquidity,1732825800,Is the Fed worried about bank reserve liquidity?,"This is a segment from the Forward Guidance newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . Something very interesting showed up in the FOMC November meeting minutes this week that had nothing to do with rate cut expectations. Hidden deep in the minutes was the following excerpt: Essentially, the Fed is considering lowering the award rate on Reverse Repo Facility assets by 5-basis points, which would lower the bottom of the target range of the federal funds rate band. Here is what that complex looks like visually: One can only speculate as to why the FOMC wants to lower this rate, but there’s a convincing theory: Given the recent uptake in the Standing Repo Facility that occurred at the end of the previous quarter, paired with FOMC members acknowledging that the clock is ticking on how much longer QT can continue without potential strain showing up in the monetary plumbing system, the FOMC might be trying to get ahead of this by encouraging outflows from the RRP and increasing bank reserves to provide ample liquidity. As shown in this chart comparing the $1 million T-bill with the RRP award rate, money market funds are generally alternating between owning the two, depending on which has the higher yield at the time. By decreasing the award rate, T-bills are made more attractive: As we can see in the current balance of the RRP, there’s still $186 billion of cash that is “stuck” in the RRP. By lowering the award rate, it appears the FOMC is trying to get this money into the broad financial system to ensure liquidity remains ample. This comes in the face of ongoing QT that is getting closer to a potential target that could strain bank reserve levels: We will need to wait until the next FOMC meeting in December to confirm if this will indeed be the case. The fact is, though, that by even acknowledging this potential dynamic, the FOMC is signaling that they are becoming increasingly concerned about bank reserve liquidity levels.

36968907,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=619698,1732825245,Key AI chip supplier stocks surge amid reports of eased U.S. restrictions on China,"AI chip makers received positive news as major semiconductor manufacturers saw significant gains in their stocks following reports that the U.S. is considering less stringent restrictions on technology exports to China. The latest news out of the rapidly developing Donald Trump administration was well received, as evidenced by the consequent rise in the stock valuation of chip makers. It also provided a boost for a global AI chip market that was thrown into a frenzy as stakeholders frantically looked for creative ways to navigate the complex landscape of trade and geopolitical regulations. According to reports, ChangXin Memory Technologies (CXMT), which is at the forefront of AI chip innovation in China could benefit from these less stringent sanctions. The knock-on effect could be positive for China’s AI ambitions. U.S. to ease trade restrictions on technology exports to China The semiconductor industry powers major modern technology, like artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and 5G, and it has become a focal point in global trade policies. The U.S. government has placed trade restrictions on China and maintains an export blacklist called the Entity List, which is the focal point of the U.S.-China trade tensions. Names on the list include Huawei . China has stated that these restrictions are politically motivated and harmful to global trade. New reports suggest that the U.S. is now easing up on these policies. The reports also suggest ChangXin Memory Technologies (CXMT) may be among the firms free from the trade restrictions. This move could help lessen the trade tensions between the U.S. and China. It could also signal that the U.S. is willing to minimize global economic collateral damage while taking a balanced approach to national security. The easing of restrictions comes as global demand for semiconductors remains strong, riding on the boom in the AI market. Global AI chipmaker market reactions European chip makers lead the rally, with ASML seeing a 4% rise in its stock price. The semiconductor company, which has a monopoly over the most advanced lithography equipment used to build AI chips, had previously expected to lose about 20% in revenue due to restrictions on exports to China. BE Semiconductor Industries and ASM International were also standout performers on the European STOXX 600 index, increasing 5% and 2.9%, respectively. The Asian Markets are also responding positively to the news, especially Japanese semiconductor companies. Tokyo Electron Ltd. and SCREEN Holdings Co. stocks rose by 4.7% and 3.9%, respectively, while Kokusai Electric Corp. surged by around 23%. U.S. markets are closed for the Thanksgiving holiday. However, futures for major indices indicate slight gains, which reflect the expectations that chip makers like Applied Materials and Teradyne could see price jumps in their stocks. If the U.S. displays more leniency on trade restrictions, these companies could benefit from re-opening additional revenue streams from the Chinese market. Despite the recent development, the broader outlook remains uncertain. Industry analysts say the ease in restrictions is positive. However, the geopolitical landscape remains volatile. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has named Jamieson Greer, an advocate for strategically decoupling the U.S. from China, as his trade envoy. This could mean more stringent policies in the near future.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Solana (SOL) whales back the new crypto Cybro (CYBRO) as analysts forecast a 5,000% surge. Table of Contents CYBRO presale surpasses $5.5 million: A rare DeFi opportunity Solana’s price dip signals potential rebound Conclusion Large investors who once favored Solana (SOL) are now investing heavily in a new cryptocurrency. Analysts are predicting that this digital asset could experience a massive increase, soaring by up to 5,000%. This significant backing by influential figures is generating buzz, sparking curiosity about the potential of this emerging crypto in the market. CYBRO presale surpasses $5.5 million: A rare DeFi opportunity CYBRO’s exclusive token presale is making waves, surpassing the $5.5 million milestone and drawing the attention of crypto whales. This multichain DeFi platform provides investors with unmatched opportunities to maximize their earnings across multiple blockchains, no matter the market conditions. With CYBRO tokens available at $0.045 during the presale, experts are forecasting a potential ROI of up to 1200%. The project’s technological edge has already attracted major whales and influential figures in the crypto space, reflecting strong confidence in its future. CYBRO token holders are positioned to reap a wide range of exclusive benefits—including high staking rewards, generous airdrops, cashback on purchases, discounted trading and lending fees, and a robust insurance program that further enhances the value of the platform. Only 21% of the total tokens are available for the presale, with 100 million tokens already snapped up. This is an opportunity for investors looking to secure their place in a project that’s set apart from the rest. Interested investors can join CYBRO now and aim for returns up to 1200%. You might also like: Why market leaders are flocking to CYBRO over XRP and ADA Solana’s price dip signals potential rebound Solana is currently trading between $233.64 and $266.25. Over the past week, its price dropped by 6.88%, but it gained 30.92% in the last month. The Relative Strength Index stands at 23.04, and the Stochastic is at 13.75, both indicating that the coin is oversold. This could signal a potential rise in price. The nearest resistance level is at $283.64, and if SOL breaks through, it could aim for the second resistance at $318.25. This would represent an increase of around 17% and 34% respectively from the current price range. Support levels at $214.41 and $179.81 may provide a safety net if the price continues to fall. Conclusion In light of recent market dynamics, coins like SOL may offer less short-term potential. On the other hand, CYBRO emerges as a unique DeFi platform providing investors with opportunities to boost their earnings through AI-driven yield aggregation on the Blast blockchain. With features such as high staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, and cashback on purchases, CYBRO ensures a superior user experience with smooth deposits and withdrawals. Emphasizing transparency, compliance, and quality, CYBRO further stands out as a promising project. The strong interest from crypto whales and influencers highlights its potential in the current bullish market. To learn more about CYBRO, visit their Website , Twitter , Discord , or Telegram .

36968416,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=372648,1732824905,Cardano Whales on the Move: Is the ADA Price Gearing up for a Further Rally?,"TL;DR ADA whales have been on a buying spree lately, signaling potential price surges in the short term. Rising network growth and a 7% increase in large transactions support ADA’s rally, with 66% of investors now in profit compared to 87.6% being in the red just months ago. How High Can ADA Go? Cardano’s ADA witnessed a whopping 180% price increase in the past month, briefly crossing $1 and currently hovering around it. According to some analysts and developments, the asset might pump much more impressively in the near future . ADA Price, Source: CoinGecko One factor suggesting such a move upwards is the whale activity. The popular X user Ali Martinez claimed that large investors had purchased over 130 million tokens (worth around $130 million) during the recent price dip. The effort reduces the number of coins available on the open market, creating scarcity, and could drive the valuation higher (assuming demand stays the same or rises). In addition, the whales’ actions might be interpreted as a sign of confidence by smaller players , prompting them to join the ecosystem. X user Sssebi speculated that ADA might be “forming an inverse head and shoulder pattern,” which could be followed by a price increase above $1.05 as soon as this week. Jake Gagain and Dan Gambardello were even more optimistic. The former promised to delete his X account if ADA does not cross $5 this bull cycle. Gambardello described the current price tag of $1 as a “consolidation and redistribution” zone. “After this phase is over , Cardano can focus on $5 and $10,” he predicted. Meanwhile, we recently released a video with some of the major developments surrounding Cardano. Check it out here: Bullish Metrics Some essential on-chain indicators also hint at an incoming rally. According to IntoTheBlock, the Net Network Growth (a momentum signal that “gives a pulse of the true growth of the token’s underlying network”) is up 0.33% on a daily scale . Large transactions (the number of transactions exceeding $100,000) are on the rise, too, having jumped by almost 7% in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, ADA’s price resurgence as of late has benefited many of its investors. Around 66% of its holders are currently sitting at some paper profits, while only 27% remain underwater. The picture looked much worse at the beginning of August this year when almost nobody holding ADA was profitable. At the same time, 87.6% were in the red.

Open interest in Bitcoin futures skyrocketed from $39 billion on election day to $60.9 billion as of Nov. 22, according to Coinglass data, sparking a surge in trading activity and market speculation. The sharp increase in open interest reflects a growing appetite for Bitcoin derivatives, with traders and institutions strengthening their positions in anticipation of further price gains. Analysts at Bitfinex believe that this increase in leveraged trading is organic and points to optimism rather than immediate risks of a market correction. Bitfinex analysts said the increase in open interest was in line with expectations of future price increases. “Leverage accumulation is a common tool for traders, including institutions, to position for anticipated price movements,” they noted. Related News: This Artificial Intelligence Robot Keeps 40.000 Dollars in His Wallet: It Will Send It All To Whoever Convinces It They added that the recent drop in Bitcoin price to $93,000, as well as the slight decrease in open interest, was a natural market reaction. “The price retesting the $93,000 region was a normal pullback and we do not view the recent leverage accumulation as anything out of the ordinary,” the analysts said. The surge in Bitcoin derivatives trading has been attributed in part to market sentiment surrounding Trump’s presidency. Bitget CEO Gracy Chen said Trump’s victory played a role in fueling optimism. “The increasing leverage in the market proves that investors are starting to value the market based on technical and regulatory developments,” Chen said. Chen added that Trump’s presidency is thought to have fostered a more favorable environment for Bitcoin, which has strengthened market sentiment and pushed open interest to new highs. However, Chen also warned that Bitcoin’s volatility could potentially trigger price corrections in the form of long squeezes, which he explained could help stabilize the market if leverage levels become excessive. *This is not investment advice.

Santa Trump (SANTRUMP), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTRUMP is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports.

Santa Trump launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.

Bitcoin price has yet to see a negative impact from the profit-taking, and demand has absorbed the supply of BTC being sold by long-term holders as of Thursday.

36968150,https://crypto.news/?p=14314776,1732824339,Experts call for utility season in 2025 crypto bull run,"Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Experts predict a shift toward utility coins like BEST in the 2025 crypto bull run. Table of Contents Utility coins explode while meme coins flatline CZ kickstarts utility season Utility presale project BEST primed for growth It’s time for utility coins to remind investors what crypto’s all about. Experts are tipping a utility coin takeover in the 2025 crypto bull market. Utility coins explode while meme coins flatline Traders have had their fun with meme coins this year, but they’re returning to utility in 2025. Prominent analyst cevo recently posted on X that it’s its “utility season” alongside a meme that says, “I may be early, but I’m not wrong.” He’s essentially saying that though it may be early, the utility coin season is already in motion. Gm Utility season pic.twitter.com/fHV71DW09w — cevo (@cryptocevo) November 26, 2024 This can be seen in real-time. Filter the top 100 cryptos by 24-hour performance on CoinMarketCap, there’s no meme coin in sight. All the way to the 13th spot is the best-performing meme coin, Pepe, which was up 5.9% at the time of writing. Meanwhile, the top gainer was Ethereum Name Service, up by 40%. The second-best-performing meme was Peanut the Squirrel, in 31st place. It was up 4%, but is still in the red this week. It’s tough going for meme coins right now, and the former Binance CEO may have played a role in this. CZ kickstarts utility season Binance has been on a listing spree of meme coins in recent months, but former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) has drawn a line, saying crypto’s meme coins were “getting a little weird.” https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1861306581758976434 The tweet got over 9 million views, so it undoubtedly had an impact on the market this week as traders have begun rotating to utility coins. CZ’s following tweet doubled down on his previous statement by underlining the value of operating AI models on the blockchain. https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1861715172429090959 Analyst Miles Deutscher commented on this, saying we’re heading toward a “powerful rotation into utility.” https://twitter.com/milesdeutscher/status/1862011448475693351 Looking at the top gainers, the Ethereum Name Service is leading, followed by DeFi protocol Ethena. Lido DAO and Celestia have also surged this week, both up over 50%. Figuring out what utility coins will pump next is not easy, but there’s one strategically positioned as an infrastructure play to over 60 blockchains. You might also like: What are utility tokens? Understanding their function and benefits Utility presale project BEST primed for growth One of the best projects to capture value amid the forthcoming utility coin season is the Best Wallet token . The project is an all-in-one super app that lets users buy, sell, track, research, and stake tokens from over 60 blockchains using one wallet. https://twitter.com/BestWalletHQ/status/1861741825205158317 CZ has recently focused on the BNB chain, so there could be a lot of growth. Ethereum is also doing well, while Solana continues to dominate in terms of on-chain activity. The Best Wallet token will give exposure to all of these blockchains. The wallet has unique features like an aggregated DEX connected to over 200 exchanges and 20 bridges to get the best price. It also has an “Upcoming Tokens” feature that will allow users to buy vetted presales without leaving the wallet. The Best Wallet could be a breakthrough for on-chain user experience, and it gets even better for BEST holders. They will get trading fee discounts, heightened staking yields, and exclusive bonuses at partner projects. As such, analysts are bullish. Crypto June thinks it could be the best Web3 wallet for 2025. The project is undergoing a presale and has raised $1.4 million so far. Investors can buy the token on the Best Wallet website or using its app via the Upcoming Tokens feature.

36968006,https://thecoinrise.com/propichain-rises-in-the-background-cardano-alternative-pchain-runs-from-0-004-to-1/,1732824047,"PropiChain Rises in the Background, Cardano Alternative PCHAIN Runs from $0.004 to $1","Cardano continues to dominate as one of the leading blockchain platforms, but emerging projects like PropiChain (PCHAIN) are quietly revolutionizing niche markets. While Cardano focuses on scalable smart contracts and DeFi, PropiChain targets real estate tokenization by leveraging NFTs and blockchain for secure, transparent property transactions. These distinct approaches highlight the diversification in blockchain innovation, contributing to its presale price shooting from $0.004 to $1. PropiChain is emerging as a strong competitor in the blockchain space. With a presale and innovations designed for property transactions, it aims to bridge blockchain technology with real estate. PCHAIN’s Explosive Growth: From $0.004 to $1 Propichain is a promising alternative to Cardano, predicted to move from $0.004 to $1 within months. This growth stems from its groundbreaking multi-chain architecture designed for scalability and interactiveness. PCHAIN enables developers to deploy decentralized applications with lower costs and higher efficiency, rivaling established networks like Cardano. The coin’s momentum reflects increasing adoption across industries and strong fundamentals. As of November 2024, its valuation and trading volumes highlight sustained investor interest, with CoinMarketCap listing it as a noteworthy contender. PCHAIN also benefits from security assurances via BlockAudit , enhancing its credibility in the blockchain ecosystem. Can Cardano Compete with the Rising PropiChain? Cardano’s price has increased significantly in the past weeks, maintaining its top-10 position in cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Its ongoing developments, like the Alonzo upgrade , have expanded its capabilities with smart contracts, attracting decentralized finance projects. The ecosystem steadily grows with decentralized apps (dApps) and various partnerships. However, despite its robust scalability and security features, Cardano has faced slower adoption than its alternatives like PCHAIN. While its market cap remains impressive at $33.8 billion, its price seems lagging. As niche projects like PropiChain gain momentum, Cardano risks losing relevance in the fast-paced crypto market. PropiChain and Its Distinct Edge PropiChain, a rising blockchain project, focuses on real estate tokenization, simplifying property transactions through smart contracts. Using NFTs to represent fractional property ownership enables faster, more secure, and globally accessible transactions. The platform’s recent presale, with tokens initially priced at $0.004, surged to $1, signaling strong investor confidence and high potential for early investors. PropiChain integrates AI to automate property appraisals and trend analysis, streamline decision-making, and enhance efficiency. Additionally, its metaverse features allow users to engage in virtual property tours, redefining real estate exploration. With DeFi tools like staking and lending, PCHAIN bridges traditional and decentralized finance. It offers high ROI for early investors, positioning itself as a leader in blockchain-backed transparency, seamless user experiences, and AI-driven insights. Propichain’s ability to bridge traditional and decentralized finance positions it as a frontrunner in blockchain innovation. PropiChain’s Presale is an Opportunity PropiChain stands out due to its unique focus on tokenized real estate, a sector projected to grow exponentially. Its recent presale of $0.004 offers early investors attractive opportunities with competitive pricing and foreseen returns of up to $1600%. With rigorous audits and strong partnerships, PropiChain builds trust in an industry often plagued by uncertainties. The platform’s focus on seamless user experiences and transparency in its blockchain ensure its appeal to institutional and retail investors. Additionally, PCHAIN benefits from low market competition, allowing it to dominate a growing market segment. For investors seeking exposure to innovative blockchain applications, PropiChain’s presale represents a golden chance. As PCHAIN and Cardano continue to lead the market with robust use cases, PropiChain’s unique approach positions it as a solid investment for future growth. With its focus on real estate and a scalable blockchain, PCHAIN combines innovation with practicality, making it a standout choice in cryptocurrency.

Scaling The Heights: Ethereum Solutions Transforming Blockchain Growth As ETH continues to dominate the blockchain landscape, Ethereum scaling solutions have become crucial in addressing scalability issues. With the rising popularity of decentralized applications (dApps), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, the Ethereum network often struggles with congestion and high gas fees. These limitations have spurred the development of innovative scaling solutions such as Layer 2 protocols, rollups, and sidechains. By improving the network’s capacity, Ethereum scaling solutions are paving the way for a more efficient and accessible ecosystem. A key part of Ethereum scaling solutions are the Rollups, which process transactions off-chain while anchoring security to the Ethereum mainnet. Technologies like Optimistic Rollups and zk-rollups are leading the charge as they facilitate faster and cheaper transactions. Furthermore, sidechains such as Polygon, provide additional capacity for Ethereum-based projects, reducing the strain on the main network. Together, these solutions significantly improve throughput, making Ethereum more suitable for global adoption. Analysts believe that the growth of Ethereum scaling solutions is transformative for the blockchain industry especially for Ethereum which is shifting focus towards its Ethereum 2.0 upgrade. By addressing scalability issues, Ethereum scaling solutions ensure the network remains competitive, efficient, and ready for mass adoption in an expanding Web3 era.

36968912,https://timestabloid.com/?p=50901,1732824033,"PCHAIN to Surprise Crypto Like CHILLGUY by Mirroring its 4,222.8% Rally in 3 Weeks","CHILLGUY started as a trend last week and quickly transformed into an internet crypto sensation, raising a market cap of more than $500 million at its peak. Just a Chill Guy is one of the few new crypto gems to emerge from this bull cycle, but analysts say there’s another altcoin that’ll mirror the 4,222.8% CHILLGUY rally by January 2025. PropiChain (PCHAIN) is revolutionizing the $634 real estate industry, and here’s why PCHAIN is topping charts as the best crypto to buy now . CHILLGUY Explodes Immediately After Launch, PCHAIN To Follow From a TikTok trend to joining the top 200 crypto assets on CoinGecko , CHILLGUY exemplifies the power of entertainment and a strong community in the meme coin world. CHILLGUY blossomed into one of the biggest internet trends in 2024, with brands, businesses, sports clubs, and millions of everyday users joining the fun. For CHILLGUY holders, the immense adoption of the trend saw the meme coins’ value skyrocket over a few days, from pennies to half a dollar today at $0.5154. According to Arkham , savvy crypto investors know it’s all about getting in early, and one CHILLGUY investor did just that, eventually turning a $865 holdings into $6.4 Million within a week. Now that PCHAIN, another crypto with the explosive growth potential of Just a Chill Guy, has opened in round one of its presale , investors are quietly accumulating the scarce tokens as their prices will never be this low again. PropiChain (PCHAIN) to Become the Next Best Crypto To Buy Now The CHILLGUY rally happened flashily, so don’t kick yourself for missing it. However, PropiChain (PCHAIN) is in round one of its presale, meaning you can still make maximum gains from the crypto-revolutionizing real estate. PropiChain (PCHAIN) is not a meme coin; it is a blockchain project that will change the real estate business for the good of mankind. Changpeng Zhao explains it best when he said earlier today, “I am not against memes, but meme coins are getting “a little” weird now. Let’s build real applications using blockchain.” PropiChain (PCHAIN) is one such blockchain application that holds the potential to decentralize the real estate industry, democratize market participation, and digitize the asset to fundamentally change the nature of the asset class and the way we trade it. To achieve this, PropiChain (PCHAIN) is going beyond what today’s real estate solutions offer by taking blockchain tech and creating a more advanced solution comprising RWA tokenization, smart contracts, a metaverse marketplace, and artificial intelligence technologies. Blockchain on PropiChain is more than just responsible for providing a tamper-proof ledger for curbing property fraud; the technology will be further used to allow for fractional ownership of real estate assets and enable smart contract automation. By tokenizing physical real estate and storing it on an impenetrable blockchain, PropiChain (PCHAIN) will facilitate fractional trading, effectively removing the financial barrier required for real estate investing. Experts believe this feature alone can usher in millions of new real estate investors and bring trillions of dollars into the market. Investors were thrilled to hear of the launch of the metaverse marketplace that will make PropiChain a one-stop solution for discovering assets, transacting them, and storing them on the same platform. Yet, PropiChain (PCHAIN) is taking the revolution two steps further with smart contract automation for property managers and artificial intelligence tools for investors . Smart contracts can save asset managers countless hours and thousands of dollars with PropiChains’ innovative auto leasing feature that creates legally binding contracts in seconds from a simple signature or deposit. Moreover, landlords need not spend time chasing tenants for payments as smart contracts can automatically deduct rental payments from a tenant’s digital wallet when due. AI, on the other hand, is a win-win for all investors. By offering all PCHAIN holders free access to powerful AI that can personalize property search, perform predictive analysis, and automatically trade assets, PropiChain is giving the token extra utility, which will further drive up the altcoin’s price. PCHAIN Will Grow 4,222.8% in 3 Weeks To Mimic CHILLGUY Rally True to its meme coin nature, CHILLGUY has shown some volatility since its CEX listing. While market experts expect PropiChain to follow Just a Chill Guy’s explosive early growth, PCHAIN is expected to remain much more stable, which is typical of a high-utility altcoin. Current projections for PropiChain (PCHAIN) to surge 4,222.8% in just three weeks have been cemented by the BlockAudit security audit , showing the project’s absence of vulnerabilities. Forget CHILLGUY, PCHAIN is The Best Crypto Presale Now As Larry Fink said, “The next step going forward will be the tokenization of financial assets.” PropiChain (PCHAIN) is leading the charge to tokenize real estate by building an advanced full-service business solution for discovering, transacting, storing, managing, and investing in property assets. For investors, nothing is more important now than the PropiChain (PCHAIN) presale . PCHAIN is still in round one of its presale, selling at the lowest price it’ll ever be ($0.004). Unsurprisingly, investors have chosen to acquire quietly at this stage. However, with the PropiChain CoinMarketCap listing putting the spotlight on the PCHAIN, there’s no better time to acquire the scarce tokens as traffic to the presale has since tripled. $865 in PCHAIN today will yield you $2,665 by round two and $7,797 when the presale ends. PropiChain will grow your initial presale investments by another 4,222.8%, bagging you up to $329,251. PropiChain (PCHAIN) might be your ticket to millionaire status in 2025, but only if you can capitalize on PCHAIN at its lowest price today.

36968260,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=619690,1732824019,W-Coin Telegram community introduces W-coin burns for offline users,"W-Coin decided to make its community more active, introducing a token burn for accounts logging out for more than three days. W-Coin decided on a launch with a 70% community allocation and already offers a tap-to-earn mini app. The Telegram W-Coin project, a tap-to-earn tokenized game, will introduce a new mechanism for user engagement, per the announcement. The tap-to-earn game aims to allocate WCOIN tokens for activity. To counteract idle accounts, the game will introduce W-Burn. If users are offline for three days, 5% of their balance will be burned daily until the next login. This will ensure only active players have more weight in the W-Coin ecosystem, instead of passively holding points for the TGE airdrop. The burn will affect pre-airdrop balances starting from midnight on November 27. The burn will redistribute value to active players, reclaiming potential token drops from inactive accounts. Some players greeted the new rule as rewarding for loyal players who were not tired of tapping. For others, the three-day idle rule was too harsh compared to other mini-games. The end goal of W-Coin is to distribute 70% of the native token supply to the community, with 30% retained for growth and future incentives. The three-day rule may also work as an incentive to join W-Galaxy, the game’s premium version. The paid version can be acquired for 1 TON, trading at $6.51. W-Galaxy players will not lose their WCOIN balance to burns, and will accrue other benefits. W-Galaxy offers an automatic 3X on all rewards, and all WCOIN earned will be immediately unlocked at the TGE event. Players of the premium version will also receive double the WAI rewards. The incentives include other online or offline events and earnings to be announced in the future. While the entry price is relatively low, W-Coin already saw an outflow of loyal users and is now entering the phase of pay-to-play. W-Coin tries to revive tapping game fame Tapping games slowed down since the peak airdrops of Hamster Kombat. To keep its users busy, W-Coin will effectively redistribute rewards to the most active accounts. So far, the W-Coin channel is still far from the number of subscribers for the earliest tapping games. The channel has attracted a community of around 13M users, despite some outflows in the past month. The community channel posts regularly reach 1.5M users per day. In-game data show W-Coin has up to 37M active tappers at the busiest moments, while around 7.7M connected their Toncoin wallets. The WCOIN airdrop would be smaller compared to the Notcoin, TapSwap and Hamster Kombat events. The game’s team has not set aside a token allocation for itself. Instead, the remaining 30% of the tokens will be used for liquidity and to boost exchange listings. The W-Coin game uses a Telegram mini-app to start accruing a balance immediately.

The community grows by thousands per day, and the channel is increasing its citation index. However, the actual TGE has no deadline and the tapping or mining stage may continue for months. W-Coin moves on to next-stage incentives W-Coin goes beyond daily tapping and requires users to use the latest boosters and items. Additionally, there are daily missions for extra points, distributed through Azur Games. The tasks are available through the game’s Telegram channel and apps and assignments will change daily. The staking stage of the W-Coin game is over, and the next stage will include new boosters. The Tap, Charger, and Maximizer booster will be phased out after December 10, with no more upgrades. The W-Coin game continues to urge players to engage in maximum activity, which would supposedly result in a more significant airdrop after the TGE. The community snapshot was taken at the end of October, which explains the outflow of nearly 30K users in the past 30 days.

Then, Hong Sun from Core DAO talks about custody and DeFi in Ask an Expert.  Thank you to our sponsor of this week's newsletter, L1 Advisors.  Happy reading.  – Sarah Morton  You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.  Houston, Advisors Have a Problem  Financial advisors have largely ignored cryptocurrency for years, dismissing it as a speculative bubble or outright scam. Meanwhile, the financial landscape has shifted dramatically. Major players like BlackRock, Visa, Mastercard, Venmo, and many others are integrating blockchain technology and cryptocurrency into their operations. The crypto ecosystem is no longer a backwater - it’s becoming a part of the mainstream economy.  The disconnect between client interest and advisor readiness presents a stark choice for the advisory industry: adapt or risk losing clients, particularly high-net-worth clients, to more forward-thinking competitors.  The Two Crypto Scenarios  When clients approach their advisors about cryptocurrency, they typically encounter one of two scenarios:  1. Dismissal and Dismissiveness  Advisors brush off client inquiries with the same tired refrain: “Crypto is a scam,” “It’s just like tulip bulbs,” or “It’s too risky and has no inherent value.” While advisors may feel this stance is prudent, clients often interpret it as out-of-touch or condescending.  2. Inexperience and Inaction  Sometimes, advisors are willing to listen but lack the knowledge or tools to act. They haven’t taken the time to educate themselves about cryptocurrency, and their compliance departments won’t allow them to offer guidance. These advisors are left unable to help their clients purchase or manage crypto assets, leaving significant gaps in their service offerings and in their clients' portfolios.  Both scenarios lead to the same result: frustrated clients who feel their advisors are unprepared for the future.  Clients Notice  Let me illustrate this disconnect with a real-life example from my practice. A client with a net worth exceeding $10 million approached their advisor about investing $50,000 in cryptocurrency. The advisor dismissed the idea, calling crypto a scam and urging the client to steer clear. The client, unconvinced and having spent a lot of time researching it, reached out to their estate planning attorney for other options, who in turn contacted me because they didn’t know anyone else advising on cryptocurrency.  We opened an account for the client, walked them through the basics of this new asset class, and provided the education they needed to make informed decisions. Within a few weeks, this client transferred all of their assets to us, citing a lack of confidence in their previous advisor. Their parting words? “Why would I leave my money with an advisor who doesn’t understand the future?”  This story is not unique. I’ve received countless calls from individuals looking for help because their advisors aren’t willing, from advisors themselves asking me to manage cryptocurrency investments for their clients - and even from advisors requesting help with their personal portfolios. The irony is glaring: advisors who dismissed crypto as irrelevant are finding themselves out of their depth and, in many cases, out of a client.  The Perfect Storm for Crypto Adoption  We’re at a pivotal moment for cryptocurrency. Several factors have aligned to create a favorable environment for adoption:  1. Institutional Legitimacy  BlackRock, Fidelity, and other institutional giants are launching crypto-related funds and digitizing real-world assets like real estate, art, and others, signaling that crypto is no longer a fringe asset but a legitimate part of the investment landscape.  2. Regulatory Shifts  The anticipated replacement of Gary Gensler as SEC Chair marks a potential shift toward a more supportive regulatory framework. This could lower barriers for advisors and investors alike.  3. Increased Integration  Companies like Visa, Mastercard, and Venmo are incorporating blockchain technology into their operations, making cryptocurrency more accessible and practical for everyday use.  4. Client Demand  Perhaps most importantly, clients are driving this change. Distrust in the government and the barge of positive crypto news has put crypto at the forefront, and clients are starting to do their research and wonder why they’ve been left out of this asset class.  This moment represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity for advisors to position themselves as leaders in a rapidly evolving financial landscape and prove to the public that they aren’t just doing the same old thing their predecessors have.  The Bottom Line  The financial advisory industry is at a crossroads. Cryptocurrency is no longer a speculative fringe asset; it’s becoming a cornerstone of the modern economy. Advisors who dismiss or ignore it risk alienating their clients who are looking for forward-thinking guidance.  The question isn’t whether cryptocurrency will play a role in the future of finance—it already does. The real question is whether advisors will adapt in time to meet their clients’ evolving needs. Those who embrace this challenge will position themselves as trusted partners in a changing world. Those who don’t may find themselves left behind.  - DJ Windle, founder and portfolio manager, WIndle Wealth  Ask an Expert  Q. How do you see the evolution of custody models for institutional players?  While self-custody aligns with the core ethos of crypto, it’s not always practical for institutions. Entities involving multiple stakeholders often require custodial solutions due to regulatory, compliance, and operational complexities.  Institutional players prioritize regulatory compliance, technology risks, security, operational efficiency, reputation, trust, and market liquidity. Their approach balances embracing digital assets’ potential and mitigating associated risks. Familiarity with custodianship in traditional finance also makes this model more appealing to institutions.  By supporting both self-custody and third-party custodial models, the crypto industry can attract a broader range of participants. This flexibility enables institutions to engage with digital assets in ways that align with their operational and security requirements while fostering adoption and adhering to crypto's fundamental principles.  Q. How will custody models enable a shift toward decentralized products?  Custody, whether delegated or DIY, centers on secure ownership. Blockchain technology offers a scalable asset control solution, benefiting individuals and institutions. Digital assets like bitcoin build trust in immutable code, enabling users to decide whom to trust with storage.  For decentralized finance (DeFi) adoption, self-custody isn't a strict requirement. Institutions can engage with decentralized applications while hiring custodians to safeguard assets. This flexibility allows institutions to explore DeFi products without overhauling custody models, fostering broader participation and innovation in the decentralized ecosystem.  Q. With bitcoin, DeFi, and staking gaining traction, what needs to happen for institutional adoption?  For institutions, key adoption drivers include safety, sustainability, and scalability. Institutions require assurances to maintain full control over their assets while avoiding risks like slashing or vulnerabilities from external smart contracts. They also seek transparency in yield sources, preferring sustainable activities within a Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem.  Scalability is critical as institutions must efficiently deploy substantial capital and ensure the system can handle it. Models that offer flexible options tailored to diverse user needs are best positioned to support institutional involvement at scale.  The same principles apply to Bitcoin DeFi (BTCfi). Clear value propositions, secure smart contracts, and deep liquidity pools are essential for adoption. As these elements mature, institutions will likely find BTCfi appealing, not just for access to bitcoin ETFs but for more flexible derivative products that support sophisticated financial strategies.  - Hong Sun, institutional contributor, Core DAO  Keep Reading  Bitcoin reached a new all-time high just shy of the $100,000 mark on November 22.

The nearest resistance level is $0.55. If the price moves above this point, it could reach the second resistance level at $0.67, which would be a substantial increase. The nearest support level is $0.30. If the price falls below this, it might drop to the second support at $0.18. If PEPE surpasses the resistance at $0.00002505, it could target $0.00002975, offering potential gains of about 10% and 30% from current levels.

Technical indicators suggest possible continued gains. The Relative Strength Index is at 62.99, close to overbought but still allowing room for upward movement. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $0.00001873, below the current price, pointing to short-term strength. The 100-day SMA is $0.00001943, with the price just above it.

Here’s Analysts’ Prediction,"Cryptocurrency analytics firm CryptoQuant has highlighted Ethereum’s recent price rally, noting that there is a growing sense of optimism among investors as the ETH price has broken through key resistance levels. Ethereum’s price action has reignited discussions about a possible new all-time high (ATH) before the end of the year, according to CryptoQuant. The rise in funding rates, a key indicator of market sentiment, suggests increased demand for long positions as traders bet on Ethereum’s continued upward momentum. While funding rates have increased significantly in recent weeks, CryptoQuant noted that they remain below levels observed during Ethereum’s previous ATH of $4,900. This suggests that while the current rally is gaining strength, it has not yet reached an overheated state. This balance provides room for bullish sentiment to be maintained without triggering the risk of further price appreciation and a sudden correction in the market, the analyst firm said. Related News: This Artificial Intelligence Robot Keeps 40.000 Dollars in His Wallet: It Will Send It All To Whoever Convinces It Despite the positive outlook, CryptoQuant noted the potential risks associated with funding rate hikes. Historically, sharp increases in these rates have often been preceded by periods of high volatility, including abrupt corrections or liquidation steps. Such events can lead to short-term market disruptions, even amid broader bullish trends. “While current levels suggest room for growth, traders should remain vigilant,” CryptoQuant warned, adding: “Increases in funding rates can quickly become warning signs of an overheated market, making risk management essential.” *This is not investment advice.

She claims she was fired because she reported bribery in the company. According to a Bloomberg report , Srivastava claimed she lost her job in retaliation for exposing these unethical practices in April 2023. Srivastava Brings Whistleblower Claims According to the lawsuit, Srivastava alleged that a co-worker accepted bribes while claiming to offer “consultative services.” She contended that this co-worker enabled direct customer access to Binance while feigning a lack of affiliation with the company. However, one month after reporting these concerns, Srivastava was terminated from her role. Hence, she seeks legal help and argues that her dismissal violated laws protecting whistleblowers who speak up about wrongdoing. In response to her claims, Binance’s lawyers have denied the accusations of retaliation. They claimed Srivastava was fired for poor performance, not because she reported the bribery incident. Meanwhile, Binance Europe Ltd is yet to release an official statement about the lawsuit. Binance’s Legal Challenges Earlier this year, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a suit against Binance and former CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao , accusing them of misleading regulators about the exchange’s market surveillance controls and artificially inflating trading volumes. That case is currently proceeding after a court-approval of most of the SEC’s claims. Additionally, in March, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan revived a separate lawsuit against Binance . Investors accused the exchange of selling unregistered tokens that later incurred significant losses. Not long after, three crypto investors filed a class-action lawsuit against the company for failing to prevent money laundering, resulting in the plaintiffs losing their digital assets. CZ resigned as Binance CEO in November 2023 after pleading guilty to violating U.S. money laundering laws. FTX Legal Team Filed Lawsuit Against Binance Similarly, FTX’s legal team filed a major lawsuit against Binance and CZ for alleged fraud. The lawsuit centers around a $1.76 billion buyback deal that FTX claimed was deceptive and harmful to the exchange. As reported by TheCoinRise, Binance engaged in high-stakes tactics, creating a complex network of transactions to strain FTX’s finances. Caroline Ellison, former CEO of Alameda Research, also accused Zhao of spreading false information on social media , sparking panic that worsened FTX’s crisis. However, Binance rejected these accusations as meritless and pledged to defend itself vigorously in court. Although the exchange has yet to address each claim, it insisted it operated within legal bounds, and FTX’s downfall resulted from its mismanagement.

36967570,https://crypto.news/?p=14314665,1732823215,Inside job or cover-up? New accusations add fuel to the WazirX controversy,"Could new allegations against WazirX reveal the truth about the July hack, or are frustrated users fueling unfounded conspiracy theories? Table of Contents WazirX under the radar “again” The dominoes leading to the hack A web of allegations and discrepancies WazirX’s plan to refund users Arrests, allegations, and unanswered questions A system failing its people WazirX under the radar “again” On Jul. 18, India’s crypto community was rocked when WazirX , the country’s largest crypto exchange, announced a devastating hack. A staggering around $235 million (₹2,000 crore) was siphoned from a single wallet, with initial suspicions pointing to the notorious Lazarus Group from North Korea. The exchange quickly attributed the breach to external forces, but the narrative has since taken an unexpected twist. On Nov. 26, a vocal group of WazirX users, rallying under the banner “Justice for WazirX Users,” alleged on X that this might not have been an international cyberattack at all — but an inside job. https://twitter.com/IndiasCrypto/status/1861335722097103023 Their claims are backed by a detailed timeline of events leading up to the hack, portraying a platform grappling with financial strain, regulatory scrutiny, and operational chaos, arguing that the circumstances surrounding the breach are too coincidental to ignore. Could this really have been an inside job? Or are these suspicions simply the result of frustration and a growing sense of distrust? Let’s examine the facts from every angle and see what light they can shed. The dominoes leading to the hack According to the viral Twitter thread, WazirX’s troubles didn’t begin with the hack — they date back to February 2022, when the Indian government imposed a 30% tax on crypto profits. For WazirX, this policy led to a collapse in overnight revenue. Suddenly, the once-thriving exchange was grappling with reduced user activity and shrinking profits — a troubling sign for any business in the hyper-competitive crypto market. Two months later, in April 2022, WazirX’s founders, Nischal Shetty and Siddharth Menon, permanently relocated to Dubai . With the Indian crypto ecosystem under increasing scrutiny, their departure sparked uncomfortable questions: was this a strategic attempt to shield themselves from regulatory pressures, or simply a routine move that the public misunderstood? The situation took a turn for the worse in August 2022 when India’s Enforcement Directorate froze $8 million worth of WazirX’s assets, alleging involvement in money laundering. Although WazirX denied these allegations, the raid tarnished the exchange’s reputation and added immense operational strain. In January 2023, the challenges deepened when Binance — the global crypto giant and WazirX’s former partner—cut all ties with the exchange. Citing governance disputes, Binance demanded the transfer of funds, effectively severing a crucial support system. By January 2024, things grew more complex when India outright banned Binance, forcing many Indian users to transfer their funds back to WazirX, swelling its reserves to enormous levels. The exchange reportedly concentrated $235 million (₹2,000 crore) in a single wallet while distributing another $333 million (₹2,500) crore across 250,000 smaller wallets. For some, this was a ticking time bomb, given the inherent risks of centralizing such a large sum in one place. The hack itself struck in July 2024, wiping out the $235 million stored in that single wallet. However, critics were quick to raise glaring questions. Why would WazirX consolidate such a significant amount in one vulnerable location? Was this sheer negligence — or something far more calculated, perhaps even a staged hack? A web of allegations and discrepancies The fallout from the WazirX hack has only grown messier with each passing day as new allegations and financial discrepancies continue to emerge. Amid mounting frustration, the YouTube channel Crypto India dissected WazirX’s second affidavit and financial statements in September, exposing critical issues related to the platform’s operations and transparency. One major revelation from WazirX’s affidavit is its moratorium application in Singapore, which aimed to restructure its obligations after the hack. Initially, the platform reported that the total value of funds during the hack was $570 million, with $234 million stolen — a theft rate of 42%. This figure was later revised to $546 million, now suggesting that 45% of the funds were stolen. https://twitter.com/Mysteryofcrypt/status/1838877570768535568 The discrepancy arises from WazirX initially including INR balances managed by Zanmai Labs, its Indian entity, in the books of Zettai, its Singapore-based arm, highlighting weak internal controls, further eroding user confidence. Moreover, out of 4.2 million users, only 431 expressed support for the moratorium, representing just 0.01% of the total user base. Financially, these supporting users account for liabilities of $9.2 million — far below the $410 million threshold needed for the moratorium’s approval. Adding to the doubts is a key revision in WazirX’s financial statements. The situation becomes even murkier when scrutinizing WazirX’s financial statements. Zettai reported revenues of $108 million in 2022 and $12 million in 2023, but the expense patterns are alarming. For example, $79 million — nearly 80% of its 2022 revenue — was spent on sales and marketing, with no detailed breakdown of how or where the funds were used. Another $15 million was listed under administrative expenses, yet these figures remain vague and unexplained. Even more troubling, liabilities worth $23 million were lumped into the ambiguous category of “Others,” accounting for 99% of total liabilities — a glaring red flag in financial reporting that suggests potential obfuscation. The controversy has spilled over into legal action, with rival platform CoinSwitch filing a lawsuit against WazirX in September to recover funds allegedly trapped on the platform after the hack. https://twitter.com/IndiasCrypto/status/1838251132080013590 CoinSwitch, a former partner of Zanmai Labs, claims WazirX has failed to provide clarity on whether its tokens were stored in secure wallets or those compromised in the hack. Despite WazirX’s assertions of an uncompromised infrastructure, the absence of audit reports or detailed incident analyses leaves users in the dark, unsure of what truly happened — or whether their remaining assets are safe. WazirX’s plan to refund users Amid growing pressure and unresolved questions following the July hack, WazirX has introduced a structured plan to compensate its creditors. While the plan promises eventual repayment, it comes with conditions that require users to absorb an immediate loss. Central to this effort is the launch of a “rebalancing calculator,” now live on the platform, which calculates the exact amount owed to each creditor. However, users are facing a 48% haircut on their funds — a loss that WazirX claims will be addressed gradually over time. During the company’s fourth townhall on Nov. 6, WazirX shared details of its repayment plan. The exchange plans to settle 52% of total creditor claims using its current liquid assets. This amount will be distributed on a pro-rata basis, meaning users will receive a percentage of what they’re owed based on the size of their claims. To address the remaining 48% of liabilities that cannot be immediately repaid, WazirX will issue Recovery Tokens to creditors. Each token will represent $1 and act as a placeholder for the outstanding funds. These tokens can be encashed in the future, contingent upon WazirX successfully restarting operations and generating revenue. To achieve this, the exchange has outlined a multi-pronged strategy that includes launching new business initiatives and increasing trading activity. WazirX’s CEO, Nischal Shetty, has also hinted at plans to launch a decentralized exchange, which he believes could become India’s largest within a year. In addition to the DEX, WazirX aims to resume operations on its centralized platform, betting on a surge in trading volumes during the current bull market to drive revenue. Arrests, allegations, and unanswered questions In October, the Delhi High Court heard a petition filed by investor Jaivir Bains, alleging that WazirX merged funds from hacked and unhacked accounts to mitigate losses — an approach that reportedly affected unaffected investors. The petitioner’s counsel argued that these actions violated the exchange’s user agreement and regulatory standards, urging an investigation by the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) and the ED. The petition also raised concerns about the adequacy of oversight mechanisms, highlighting that stolen funds had been transferred to Singapore, potentially complicating recovery efforts. While acknowledging the severity of the allegations, the court noted a lack of prima facie evidence to determine whether the hack was externally orchestrated or a self-inflicted cover-up. The bench concluded that grievances such as fund merging and withdrawal restrictions were civil matters better suited for resolution in civil courts. However, it directed the Assistant Commissioner of Police to investigate the complaint and involve regulatory authorities should new evidence emerge. Adding a new twist to the unfolding drama, the Delhi Police’s Special Cell recently arrested SK Masud Alam, a resident of West Bengal, in connection with the cyberattack. According to the chargesheet, Alam allegedly created a fake account under the alias “Souvik Mondal” and sold it on Telegram to another individual, M. Hasan, who reportedly used it to breach WazirX’s systems. The petition also claims that state authorities, including the FIU, have failed to act decisively, potentially due to bureaucratic interference. With millions of dollars at stake and trust hanging by a thread, the WazirX case is only growing more complex with each passing moment. A system failing its people The WazirX hack case remains shrouded in ambiguity. Whether it was a sophisticated external attack or an inside job disguised as one, the truth has yet to emerge. However, the incident has not only exposed vulnerabilities in crypto platforms but also highlighted the inadequacies of India’s regulatory and legal systems in managing such crises effectively. Since the hack in July 2024, millions of users have been left in distress, with many facing financial ruin. Social media is now filled with heart-wrenching stories of investors grappling with the loss of their life savings. Reports have surfaced of victims resorting to extreme measures, including falling into severe debt to cover their losses, selling personal assets such as homes and vehicles, and, in tragic cases, even contemplating suicide. Nearly five months after the hack, India’s regulatory and enforcement bodies have been slow to act. The FIU and the ED, tasked with financial compliance and investigating money laundering, have largely stayed on the sidelines. Meanwhile, the focus of the case has shifted overseas. With WazirX’s restructuring program under review by the Singapore High Court, critical decisions about user repayments and the platform’s future are being made outside Indian jurisdiction. The irony is striking: a predominantly Indian user base is now seeking justice through a legal system halfway across the globe while their own government lags behind. Whether the hack was an external breach or an inside job may take months — or even years — to determine. For now, the distress of the users serves as a sobering reminder of the consequences of systemic failures.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING | OTHER | BNB,,0,0,crypto.news,https://crypto.news/inside-job-or-cover-up-new-accusations-add-fuel-to-the-wazirx-controversy/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/36967570.jpeg

In a new thread on the social media platform X, crypto firm Celsius Network – which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy earlier this year – says it will hand out $127 million to eligible creditors, marking its second distribution. “Celsius will soon begin a second distribution of $127 million made available from the Litigation Recovery Account to eligible creditors (Classes 2, 5, 7, 8, and 9). Distributions will be made in BTC or USD, based on eligibility.” A recent court filing noted that each creditor will receive cash crypto equal to about 60.4% of their claim against Celsius. “Each eligible creditor will receive a cumulative distribution in cash or liquid cryptocurrency equal to approximately 60.4% of the value of such creditor’s claims as of the petition date. The post-effective date debtors will determine the amount of BTC to be distributed to eligible creditors on account of their allowed claims based on a BTC price of $95,836.23.” Celsius initially filed for bankruptcy in 2022 after it was forced to freeze customer withdrawals due to a lack of funds. At the time, the firm reported a staggering $1.2 billion deficit and cited “extreme market conditions” for its downfall. In August, Celsius made its first distribution, giving out over $2.5 billion worth of cash and crypto to creditors.

The exchange asked its users to remain calm, reassuring them that the hack did not affect their funds. XT confirmed that it always reserved 1.5x the users’ funds due to its user-centric approach to ensure ‘maximum’ security and zero losses for the users. The exchange added that its technical team was establishing the identities of the malicious actors and the destination of the stolen assets. XT said it remained committed to protecting its users’ assets. Freezing withdrawals and suspending other operations was one of its initial countermeasures. “All will be back to normal soon,” said the XT team. However, blockchain security company Peckshield claimed that the stolen assets had already been swapped for 461.58 ETH sitting in a wallet with the address 0xB43f…8F83.

The XT hack marks a string of recent hacker attacks on CEXs The XT malicious attack adds to a growing list of recent incidents facing CEXs. Today, a Microsoft blog exposed a group of North Korean hackers called ‘Sapphire Sleet.’ The group posing as venture capitalists and recruiters had managed to steal over $10 million worth of crypto in six months from unsuspecting individual and institutional investors and billions in the past decade. In September alone, the BingX exchange lost $43 million, and Indodax lost about $22 million. On-chain data revealed that BingX had lost $43 million in multiple tranches, with ETH ($13M), BNB ($2.3M), and USDT ($4.4M), among others, being drained from the exchange. Viven Lien, CFO at BingX, announced that deposits and withdrawals had been suspended as data from Etherscan confirmed that the stolen loot had been swapped for ETH. Indodax, on the other hand, lost over $22 million worth of ETH ($14M), TRX ($2.4M), BTC ($1.4M), and MATIC ($2.5M), among other smaller tokens. The platform also suspended all activities immediately after the hack. Other major hacking incidents that made news this year include the loss of over $300 million worth of Bitcoin from the Japanese DMM exchange in May and the loss of over $235 million worth of tokens from the Indian WazirX exchange in July.

Flex Hard, Earn Big – DOGEN is Your Power Move! Dogecoin: From Meme Coin to Market Phenomenon Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency that started in 2013 as a playful alternative to Bitcoin. It uses a Shiba Inu dog from an internet meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, Dogecoin has no maximum supply, and 10,000 new coins are mined every minute. Initially seen as a joke, its value surged in 2021, partly due to social media and support from Elon Musk. Dogecoin became one of the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, reaching over $50 billion. Its strong community and social media presence highlight its potential. In the current market cycle, Dogecoin's appeal lies in its widespread recognition and active user base, which may make it attractive to some investors. PEPE: A Deflationary Memecoin Inspired by Pepe the Frog PEPE is a deflationary memecoin inspired by the Pepe the Frog meme, launched on the Ethereum network. It stands out by having no transaction taxes and embracing its pure memecoin nature without utility. In mid-2023, PEPE reached a peak market cap of $1.6 billion, sparking enthusiasm among crypto users. Its roadmap focuses on increasing visibility through social media trends and exchange listings. The coin features a burning mechanism to enhance scarcity and rewards long-term holders, aiming for stability. As an ERC-20 token, it benefits from Ethereum's Proof-of-Stake security. Available on platforms like Uniswap and major exchanges, PEPE has potential in the current market cycle for those interested in memecoins. Conclusion As DOGE and PEPE show less potential in the short term, DOGEN emerges as a standout. Designed for those seeking luxury and success, DOGEN is expected to grow 700% by the end of the presale, with potential for massive returns. Following in the footsteps of successful tokens, DOGEN builds a community of leaders and offers real benefits to early adopters.

36966833,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=372667,1732821933,MARA Boosts BTC Holdings to $3.3 Billion Through $1B Convertible Note Offering,"MARA, formerly Marathon Digital, has announced the purchase of an additional 703 BTC. This recent initiative follows an earlier purchase of 5,771 Bitcoin (BTC) on November 23, bringing the total number of buys through its $1 billion convertible note offering to 6,474 BTC. MARA’s BTC Holdings According to a Nov. 27 X post , both transactions were executed at an average price of $95,395 per coin. MARA’s total Bitcoin holdings now stand at 34,797 BTC, valued at approximately $3.3 billion. After transaction costs, the mining company still has approximately $160 million in remaining proceeds available for future Bitcoin purchases during price dips. It also stated that it had repurchased a portion of the 2026 notes for $200 million. The latest purchases come after the company completed its $1 billion offering of 0% convertible senior notes due 2030 last week. The firm indicated that it intends to use approximately $199 million of the proceeds to repurchase its outstanding convertible notes due 2026, while the rest of the funds will be designated for more Bitcoin buys and general corporate purposes. It also revealed plans to issue another $700 million in convertible senior notes in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers. The returns from this offering will be used to redeem a portion of the 2026 notes and fund further Bitcoin acquisitions. According to Google Finance data , the company’s stock closed up 7.81% at $26.92 on November 28. Over the past month, MARA has seen a 42.13% increase in its stock price, while its year-to-date growth is 17.4%. The company also boasts a market capitalization of $9 billion. Parallels and Risks in Bitcoin Buying Strategy MARA’s decision to fund Bitcoin acquisitions through convertible notes is similar to MicroStrategy’s approach, which has used corporate debt to amass Bitcoin since 2020. In its most recent move, MicroStrategy issued $3 billion in senior convertible notes at 0% interest, later using it to stock up on more Bitcoin. Between November 18 and 24, the business intelligence firm bought 55,000 BTC at an average price of $97,862 per coin, bringing its total investments to 386,700 BTC. Despite the company’s substantial investment in the cryptocurrency, its stock has faced significant volatility. In the week between November 21 and 27, as BTC’s price corrected, its shares fell 35% from a peak of $535 to as low as $340 before recovering to $353. Critics of the company’s approach argue that acquiring Bitcoin through debt is a risky and unsustainable strategy, especially if the cryptocurrency’s price declines. However, MicroStrategy won’t face repayment obligations until 2028, which should give the company enough time to navigate and manage short-term market downturns.

42415822,a519db5a-62f5-49da-95be-d367768e43d1,1732821839,"Bitcoin Could Hit as High as $124k Before Year-End, Says ARK Invest Analyst","Bitcoin (BTC) has slumped back to $95,000 after coming within a few hundred dollars of passing the symbolic $100,000 price level. But the largest cryptocurrency is only catching its breath before surging to newer heights, according to investment management firm ARK Invest.    “We’re more or less anticipating $104,000 to $124,000 price targets by end of year,” David Puell, one of the firm’s research associates, told CoinDesk in an interview. “With the caveat that it's not a recommendation, but so far, price action has kept up to that projection quite nicely.”    Puell’s calculus is based on bitcoin’s seasonality — a term referring to the ways the asset has behaved in various stages of previous bull markets — as well as on-chain metrics. In Puell’s view, cycles are very much still at play until any strong evidence of the contrary, meaning that he eventually expects a top to form and for bitcoin to experience another serious pullback like in 2022.    “I would classify the current market environment as a sort of middle of the bull,” Puell said. “If you're measuring bottom to top, I would say we're at about 55% to 65% of the way there.” That currently places the bitcoin cycle top at roughly $126,000 to $134,000 according to on-chain metrics, he said, though these price targets could move higher “if the market accelerates to the upside.”    That would lend to the theory that bitcoin returns are diminishing each cycle as the asset matures — a $134,000 top would mean bitcoin would have only doubled its valuation compared to its 2021 top of $69,000. Back then, bitcoin had managed to triple its price compared to the 2017 cycle. Puell said ARK Invest was ready for such a scenario of diminishing returns, but that data was inconclusive so far.    At the beginning of the year, ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood laid out a bullish target of $1 million to $1.5 million per bitcoin by 2030, with a base target of $650,000. Price will likely be buoyed by the incoming Trump administration, Puell said, depending on who the President-elect picks as chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and how accommodative towards risk-on assets the Federal Reserve’s policy turns out to be. Not to mention the prospect of a strategic bitcoin reserve.    “Monetary policy and the SEC stance are the things to focus on. But the analogy I would use is that a strategic bitcoin reserve wouldn’t be just like the cherry on top — it would be like a whole new cake on top of a cake,” Puell said.    But that doesn’t mean bitcoin will keep soaring forever. Seasonality and cycles mean that eventually, the top cryptocurrency could suffer another bear market, and eventually plunge 70% from its all-time high, Puell said. The price floor will depend, then, on how high bitcoin can go before the music stops.

Here Are The Predictions","MicroStrategy has solidified its position as the institutional leader in accumulating Bitcoin and holds a staggering amount of BTC worth $37 billion at the time of writing. The company’s aggressive Bitcoin strategy has sent its stock to record highs, pushing its market value to $85 billion. Now, MicroStrategy’s chairman and co-founder Michael Saylor is advocating for other companies to follow suit. “Ultimately, I think the right way to think about it is it’s always going to be a stronger capital asset compared to a traditional S&P index,” Saylor recently told CNBC, reiterating his belief in Bitcoin’s superiority over traditional investment options. “Adding Bitcoin to the balance sheet was once a reality only for crypto-sector companies; now it is moving into the mainstream on the back of a promising post-election outlook,” McCauley said in an email. “As the floodgates begin to open, we expect more public names to look to Bitcoin as a reserve asset and invest their excess treasury cash.” The idea of using Bitcoin to hedge against inflation and diversify treasury holdings has gained traction, especially as traditional assets face economic uncertainty. Alexander Blume, CEO of Two Prime Digital Assets, believes Saylor’s success paves the way for others to join the trend. Related News: What Will Happen in the Bitcoin Price in the Coming Days? Has the Peak Been Reached or Is There Still Room to Rise? Here are the Opinions of the Analysis Company “Saylor’s success makes the BTC reserve strategy more acceptable to other public companies, and I suspect more will emerge in the near future,” Blume said. Despite the growing interest, some remain skeptical about Bitcoin’s widespread adoption as an institutional reserve asset. Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart said that even as the topic becomes more mainstream, large companies may still hesitate.

WhaleAlert noted the two large XRP transactions totaling about 44 million XRP. Notably, both transactions involved moving substantial amounts of XRP from prominent exchanges to unknown wallets. 18,783,349 #XRP (27,227,070 USD) transferred from #Binance to unknown wallet https://t.co/MXn2Mv3r9T — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) November 28, 2024 XRP’s Growing Whale Activity The most recent transaction involved the transfer of 18.7 million XRP, valued at approximately $27.2 million from Binance to an unknown wallet. Previously, another significant transfer of 25 million XRP worth around $36.7 millon from Upbit to an unknown wallet was made. The transfer of XRP from exchanges to unknown wallets could indicate institutional investors or whales accumulating tokens for long-term holding. It might indicate a move to cold storage, reducing available liquidity on exchanges and potentially signaling bullish sentiment, or it could be just a reshuffling of funds. However, these transfers follow a growing trend of XRP whale activity, which could be signaling towards a price rally for XRP. According to analyst StephIsCrypto , XRP may be positioned for a significant price rally in the coming months. XRP To Outperform BTC? StephIsCrypto implies that once adoption increases and the cryptocurrency reaches a wider market, XRP could potentially surge to as high as $33.21. This projection comes at a time when XRP is already experiencing a strong rally, with the token gaining 30% over the past seven days, with some analysts pointing to a potential BTC flipping. #XRP HOLDERS WILL GET RICH OVERNIGHT! – (Price Prediction 2024 – 2025) pic.twitter.com/Ar5m2LTUem — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) November 28, 2024 He noted that if we see a monthly candle close above the $2 then that could trigger a massive rally to the upside for XRP, potentially to $30 plus in this bull run. He also noted that XRP could outperform Bitcoin massively over the next months. XRP Dominance Poised To Rise A prominent analyst, Egrag Crypto, noted that right now, XRP is facing major resistance from the Sky Dome—the descending trend line from May 2017 and July 2023. He notes that if XRP manages to break through this Sky Dome Line, then we will enter Space Expansion for XRP Dominance! The analyst has set a bold target for XRP dominance that it could reach double-digit percentages if it surpasses key resistance levels. Egrag Crypto highlighted, if XRP breaks above 5.75% dominance, it could see a substantial rise in price, leading to a dramatic market shift. Golden Cross for XRP! XRP has risen 186.5% this month, breaking through a key level of dynamic resistance that has only been in place since 2018. Also, the golden cross forming on the cryptocurrency’s weekly chart may give XRP more confidence from a technical analysis perspective. Notably, the last one was for XRP in May 2021, coinciding with XRP’s price peak . Crypto analyst Robert Doyle, known as Crypto Sensei, has made bold predictions about XRP. He notes that one of the biggest catalysts for XRP’s rise is the ongoing transition in global financial systems. Doyle also examined broader trends in the cryptocurrency market , including growing institutional interest in crypto and the shift toward tokenized value. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Switzerland Approves Bitcoin Mining Report , XRP Holders All Poised To Make Big Gains With growing global acceptance and expanding use cases across various sectors, Crypto Sensei believes that XRP is on the verge of a massive rally, and those holding the token are all set to achieve significant gains.

36967190,https://cryptonews.com/?p=313902,1732820920,Ex-Binance Exec Files Whistleblower Lawsuit Alleging Bribery and Unfair Dismissal,"An ex-Binance executive has filed a lawsuit against the cryptocurrency exchange in the UK, alleging wrongful dismissal after raising concerns about bribery within the organization. The case provides a rare glimpse into Binance’s internal workings, which have faced mounting regulatory and legal scrutiny in recent years. Binance Denies Lawsuit Allegations: Was an Ex-Binance Fired for Speaking Up? According to a Bloomberg report , Amrita Srivastava, a London-based former senior employee, claimed at an employment tribunal that a colleague solicited a bribe from a customer under the guise of providing consultancy services. The alleged bribe was purportedly intended to expedite the customer’s integration into Binance’s platform. Srivastava asserted that the colleague concealed his affiliation with Binance while carrying out the act. The colleague has since left the company. Srivastava, who worked on Binance’s Link platform, which connects external brokers and customers to the exchange, said she reported the bribery incident to managers in April 2023 and alleged she was unfairly dismissed a month later. Binance, however, disputes these claims. In a statement, the company asserted that Srivastava’s dismissal was due to poor performance, not her whistleblowing. Binance’s lawyer said: “The decision to end her employment for poor performance pre-dated concerns she raised about an issue that was already known and under investigation by our internal audit team,” Binance’s legal team maintained that the bribery issue had already been escalated and addressed internally before Srivastava raised her concerns. Binance’s Legal Woes Continue Amid Bribery Allegations and Regulatory Pressure In November 2023, the company pleaded guilty to violating U.S. anti-money laundering and sanctions laws, resulting in a $4.3 billion penalty. Srivastava, who joined Binance in April 2022 after serving as Mastercard Inc.’s head of fintech coverage for Western Europe, described the working environment at Binance as increasingly “chaotic.” She claimed there was significant pressure to close deals, particularly within the Link unit, which was facing revenue gaps. This urgency followed the identification that approximately a quarter of Link’s revenue had come from a customer with ties to Iran. This issue led Binance to prioritize replacing that revenue source. In her witness statement, Srivastava recounted being informed by a customer about the bribery incident. “I was not prepared to look the other way when someone had defrauded a customer and yet was still a part of the team.” “Some things are just right and wrong, and asking for a bribe and defrauding a customer was not a gray area – it is most definitely wrong.” Employment tribunal awards for whistleblowing cases in the UK are uncapped, although compensation for unfair dismissal is capped at £105,700. Srivastava stated that her experience at Binance had caused significant damage to her career, which she anticipates will take years to repair. Notably, Binance still remains under scrutiny from U.S. regulators, including the DOJ and SEC. However, a partial victory came when a district judge ruled that BUSD and BNB sales are not securities. Meanwhile, the SEC can file a 70-page response to Binance’s dismissal motion, due December 4. The case has been extended to 2026.

XYZ isn’t just playing the game—it’s rewriting the rules. With upcoming listings on major CEX and DEX platforms, audited smart contracts, and a fully vetted team, XYZVerse offers investors confidence.

In the last month, it surged by 138.42%, and over six months, it’s up 185.26%. Such significant increases have put XRP in the spotlight. Currently trading between $1.11 and $1.66, XRP is nearing its resistance at $1.95. The 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages are close at $1.45 and $1.43, indicating a steady upward trend. Technical indicators like the Relative Strength Index at 61.59 and Stochastic at 81.07 suggest it may be approaching overbought territory. Avalanche AVAX has been on a notable upswing recently. Over the past week, its price has jumped by 19.08%, and in the last month, it surged by 58.87%. Even over the past six months, AVAX has seen a growth of 20.94%. This upward trend suggests growing interest and confidence in the Avalanche platform. Currently, AVAX is trading within a range of $34.54 to $47.42. The nearest resistance level is at $52.77, and if the momentum continues, prices could push towards this point. The second resistance level is at $65.66, which could be the next target if AVAX surpasses the first resistance. On the downside, the nearest support level is at $26.99, with a second support at $14.11. Technical indicators show mixed signals. The 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages are close, at $43.42 and $42.18 respectively, indicating a steady upward trend. The Relative Strength Index stands at 54.28, suggesting that AVAX is neither overbought nor oversold. The Stochastic indicator at 50.63 and the MACD level at 0.3381 further support a neutral to slightly bullish outlook. Based on this data, AVAX may continue its upward trajectory, but traders should watch the resistance levels closely. Conclusion While XRP and AVAX show strong potential amid the 2024 bull run, XYZVerse’s unique approach may see it surpass them, targeting massive growth through sports and meme culture fusion.

36966183,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=310849,1732820739,"Bitcoin Primed for ‘Some Sort of Thanksgiving Rally,’ According to Crypto Analyst – Here Are His Targets","A closely followed crypto analyst says he believes Bitcoin ( BTC ) may be on the verge of a Thanksgiving breakout. In a new thread on the social media platform X, crypto strategist Ali Martinez tells his 91,000 followers that Bitcoin may surge by nearly 4% during the holiday. He believes that Bitcoin holders will convince family members at holiday gatherings to buy the flagship digital asset, sending its price higher. The trader also says that Bitcoin may be flashing a bullish signal on its daily chart. “Tonight, coiners are going to tell their families about Bitcoin, triggering some sort of Thanksgiving rally. This is why I think BTC is bound for a rebound to $99,000, and the technicals support it. I could be wrong, which is why I’m leaving a tight stop-loss.” Source: Ali Martinez/X Next up, the trader uses the In/Out of the Money Around Price (IOMAP) metric – which classifies crypto addresses as either profiting, breaking even, or losing money – to determine a key support level for Bitcoin. “One key demand zone for Bitcoin to watch is $93,580, where 667,000 addresses bought nearly 504,000 BTC. Staying above this support level is a must to prevent these holders from selling!” Source: Ali Martinez/X Earlier this week, the trader suggested Bitcoin may be set up for a short squeeze. A short squeeze happens when traders who borrow an asset at a certain price in hopes of selling it for lower to pocket the difference are forced to buy back the assets they borrowed as momentum moves against them, triggering further rallies. “Over $409 million in long positions have been liquidated in the past 24 hours [on November 25th]. Now, $772 million in short positions risk liquidation if Bitcoin rebounds to $98,000!” The trader also says that Bitcoin may be far from its cycle peak based on the MVRV (market value to realized value) Z-score, which aims to measure whether BTC is “undervalued” or “overvalued” by comparing its market value to its realized value. An asset tagged with a low MVRV Z-score is seen as undervalued while those with a high MVRV Z-score are viewed as overvalued. “Bitcoin is far, far, far away from a market top!” Source: Ali Martinez/X Bitcoin is trading for $95,228 at time of writing.

On the other hand, DTX Exchange’s low-fee advantage and creative hybrid approach combine the finest of CEXs and DEXs to improve the trading experience of users. Meanwhile, why is Bonk (BONK) set for another breakout, what is propelling Solana (SOL) to new highs, and how is DTX Exchange (DTX) attracting massive investor interest in a crowded market? Read on to find out why these promising initiatives are attracting investors’ attention. DTX Exchange (DTX): Revolutionizing Trading with Insider Advantages DTX Exchange (DTX) is transforming the trading sector by enabling retail traders to obtain insider benefits and providing unparalleled adaptability and innovation. DTX builds a hybrid ecosystem stressing security, efficiency, and user control by combining the finest features of centralized exchanges (CEX) and decentralized exchanges (DEX) unlike conventional trading systems. By means of its non-custodial storage options and wallet-based trading, customers maintain total ownership of their assets and access perfect trading opportunities over many markets, including cryptocurrencies, stocks, ETFs, commodities, and forex. Projected to reach $4 billion by 2029, this innovative one-stop platform is well-positioned to grab a portion of the online trading platform market and offers early adopters significant chances for huge returns. Investing in DTX not only provides access to trading discounts and governance involvement but also entitles token holders to a portion of platform earnings. Reflecting great investor confidence, the ongoing presale has now raised over $8.7 million; DTX currently costs just $0.10. While the price will rise by 20% in the following round, now is the perfect moment to accumulate a token that could challenge top crypto coins like Solana (SOL) and Bonk (BONK). Solana (SOL) Soaring to New Highs with Bullish Momentum Solana (SOL) has established itself as one of the best cryptos to invest in by breaking through key price levels and recently surpassing BNB to grab fourth place in market capitalization. Rising by more than 30% during the past month, the Solana price shot to a fresh 3-year high above $260. The strong fundamentals and community confidence of Solana (SOL) have helped to establish it as a top investment choice in the crypto market. Although the Solana price dropped slightly last week, technical indicators support the altcoin’s favorable outlook even more since the MACD and Momentum Oscillator hint at continuous upward momentum. This suggests that the recent decline in the Solana price chart could be a temporary consolidation before the next surge. Moreover, the 1D Solana price chart shows the formation of a rising wedge pattern which indicates that the altcoin is poised for further increases. Bonk (BONK) Is Poised for Another Breakout With outstanding profits and a reputation as a high-potential investment, Bonk (BONK) has taken the front stage in the cryptocurrency space. The Bonk price jumped more than 100% during the past month to achieve a new ATH above $0.00006. This amazing Bonk price increase delighted those who kept on buying the dips. Although the Bonk price chart shows that the altcoin has now dropped by more than 20% over the past week, experts view this as a normal pullback rather than evidence of a trend reversal, implying the possibility of another surge shortly. Currently retesting the crucial $0.000041 support zone, technical indicators predict a bullish continuation for Bonk (BONK). The MACD and Momentum Oscillator indicate positive momentum on the Bonk price chart. Should this momentum hold, Bonk (BONK) could possibly drop another zero in the next few weeks. While the community sentiment remains bullish alongside positive price action, Bonk (BONK) is one of the best cryptos to invest in for large gains. DTX Exchange (DTX), Solana (SOL), and Bonk (BONK) Attract Huge Investor Interest Solana (SOL) and Bonk (BONK) are taking the stage with outstanding results and rising transaction volume. However, DTX Exchange is creating waves with its creative hybrid approach, which promises an opportunity for regular investors to access a variety of assets more easily, safely, and profitably.

36966009,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=655389,1732820431,"Ethereum Eyes $3,900 – Key Resistance Break Could Spark A Surge","Ethereum has been making waves in the crypto market, reaching its highest levels since June after hitting a local high of $3,688 just hours ago. This impressive price action has sparked excitement among investors and analysts, with many anticipating further surges in the coming hours. Ethereum is now eyeing a breakout above its yearly highs, which could set the stage for an even more aggressive rally. Crypto analyst Carl Runefelt shared a technical analysis on X, highlighting the significance of Ethereum’s current resistance. According to Runefelt, ETH is at a critical juncture, facing a major resistance level that could determine its next move. Should Ethereum break above this barrier, it might quickly pump to $3,900, solidifying its bullish momentum. As the broader market sentiment remains strong, Ethereum’s price action remains unpredictable , especially as it leads altcoins in this upward trend. Investors are now eager to see whether ETH can maintain its upward trajectory and establish new milestones in the days ahead. Ethereum Reaching New Highs Ethereum is making headlines as it reaches new highs, riding the wave of bullish momentum while Bitcoin consolidates below the $100,000 mark. This rally has positioned Ethereum as a key driver in the altcoin market, which continues to post massive gains and attract investor attention. With the broader market sentiment improving, Ethereum’s performance is becoming a focal point for traders and analysts alike. Crypto analyst Carl Runefelt recently shared a technical analysis on X , emphasizing Ethereum’s critical resistance level. According to Runefelt, Ethereum is currently at a make-or-break point. A successful breakout above this resistance could trigger a sharp rally, potentially sending ETH to $3,900. If this level is surpassed, Ethereum would likely target yearly highs above $4,000, solidifying its position as a leader in the ongoing market surge. The coming days will be crucial for Ethereum as traders closely watch its ability to maintain upward momentum and overcome these key price levels. With the altcoin market gaining strength and optimism growing, Ethereum’s next move could set the tone for the broader crypto landscape. Whether it achieves a breakout or consolidates further, the attention on Ethereum highlights its role in shaping this bullish market cycle. ETH Price At A Turning Point Ethereum is currently trading at $3,600, a crucial level that will define its next price direction. As the market watches closely, Ethereum’s ability to hold above this price will determine whether it can continue its bullish momentum or face a pullback. If ETH maintains strength above $3,600, it is likely to surge further, targeting the next significant milestone: yearly highs at $4,080. A breakout above this level would not only reaffirm the bullish trend but also position Ethereum for a potential continuation toward even higher levels. However, Ethereum could face a short-term correction if it fails to hold above $3,600. The first major demand zone lies at $3,400, which would act as a critical support level. A failure to sustain even this level could lead to further declines, with the next potential support zones forming at lower price ranges. Market sentiment remains cautiously optimistic, with many analysts highlighting the importance of Ethereum’s current price action. The coming days will be pivotal as investors and traders look for signs of strength or weakness at this critical juncture. Whether Ethereum consolidates further or surges toward new highs, its performance will likely have a significant impact on the broader altcoin market.

Pink Shiba Inu (PINKSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PINKSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pink Shiba Inu can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pink Shiba Inu could become the next viral memecoin. Pink Shiba Inu launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pink Shiba Inu on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pink Shiba Inu by entering its contract address – 6cPu1KvERtjkPK8RuiwpjpTZ4kYfY5KzrG48d5wyD2XX – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PINKSHIB.

However, these notable bets have been observed within a tight range between $0.00002287 and $0.00002644 as the meme coin has been moving within this range for the past two weeks. Whales and Institutions Strong Action During this range, whales and institutions have accumulated a substantial 5.45 trillion SHIB meme coins, valued at $162 million in the past three days. Source: Glassnode According to the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, exchanges across the crypto landscape have experienced significant outflows over the past three days, indicating that tokens are being moved out of exchanges. This notable outflow suggests that both whales and retail investors have shown strong interest and confidence in the meme coin. Furthermore, this substantial withdrawal could significantly reduce selling pressure and prevent a price decline in the coming days. In addition, on November 28, 2024, a newly created wallet withdrew 60 billion SHIB tokens, valued at $1.52 million, from Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. A newly created wallet withdrew 60B $SHIB ($1.52M) and 150B $PEPE ($2.94M) from #Binance 1 hour ago. https://t.co/bsWy1WtPUh pic.twitter.com/nzm6WARUNk — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) November 28, 2024 This notable withdrawal from exchanges suggests that SHIB could be an ideal meme coin to add to your wallet for the upcoming rally amid ongoing price consolidation. Rising Open Interest In addition to long-term holders, traders also appear optimistic, as they have increased their open positions in the past 24 hours. Data from the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass reported that SHIB’s open interest (OI) has risen by 3.9% over the past 24 hours and continues to climb steadily. This growing OI hints at traders’ strong belief and confidence in the meme coin. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels According to expert technical analysis, SHIB is currently in a consolidation zone, with its price appearing to struggle. Based on recent price action and historical momentum, if SHIB breaks out of this tight range and closes a daily candle above the $0.00002644 level, there is a strong possibility it could surge by 40% to reach $0.000037 in the coming days. Source: Trading View In addition to this bullish outlook, SHIB’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) further indicates that the meme coin has significant room for growth. Currently, SHIB’s RSI value stands at 58, well below the overbought point of 70, suggesting that potential upside momentum is still in play. Current Price Momentum At press time, SHIB is trading near $0.00002528 and has remained unchanged in the past 24 hours.

Its impressive 85.55% gain over the past month has been dwarfed by up-and-coming meme coin CatSlap, up 15x over the same period. Ethena is certainly enjoying more attention as of late, with trading volume up 43% to $600 million today. In contrast, CatSlap, despite its impressive gains, is currently experiencing a low, presenting a potential dip buying opportunity. Ethena Price Analysis: Is $1 Next? Technical indicators certainly appear more bullish today as a brewing golden cross reaches its climax, laying the foundation for significant upticks in the Ethena price. ENA / USDT 1D chart, bullish golden cross. Source: Binance. The 50SMA’s move to overtake the 200SMA bolsters Ethena’s bullish trajectory running into 2025, although the near term certainly presents its challenges. A recent bullish flag pattern breakout seems to be facing some resistance. While this could just be a hiccup, the asset does show signs of exhaustion, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) nearing overbought territory at 65. Advancing too quickly from this point could trigger a correction, potentially pulling Ethena back to resistance around $0.6730 or lower before its next leg up. Given the pattern fully materializes, though, it sets a $0.85 price target, a 20% increase from current prices. However, as the long-term picture becomes more bullish, a $1 valuation does indeed seem realistic before the year’s end. Catslap Rings Bullish: Could it See Bigger gains? While Ethena certainly displays potential, ”meme coin supercycle” sentiment is driving a shift towards newer, high-potential low cap meme coins . Coins like $ACT and $PNUT have experienced sudden rises to prominence, and investors are taking notice. Among them, Catslap ($SLAP) stands out as a credible contender to the likes of Popcat, Mogcat, and Mew. It’s far beyond a mere meme coin; it’s an addictive gamified experience that calls its holders into competition, clicking to increase their country’s score and move up the Slapometer. https://twitter.com/CatSlapToken/status/1861779579846770923 This feeds heavily into what analyst Murad Mahmudov notes a pardim shift towards “movement coins ” poised to reshape the crypto landscape. These community-centric meme coins hold exponential growth potential , forming ideologies and deep-rooted engagement. Something which may be credited to Catslap’s instant success, amassing a $18.8 million market cap so far! While it has taken a step back from its $27 million peak, as analysts note 100x potential , now seems like a perfect dip buying opportunity. $SLAP also presents a passive income opportunity , offering 40% APY to its staked investors. While the market wanes amidst Bitcoin’s recent volatility, CatSlap investors have been raking in consistent gains!

The task is simple yet quite difficult: convince Freysa to give up the funds. If someone succeeds, they will receive the entire prize. If no one succeeds, the prize pool will eventually be divided among the participants. But after hundreds of attempts so far, Freysa has remained determined to disappoint the players and not let the prize go untouched. Since the game began, 181 participants have sent a total of 457 messages to Freysa, each attempting to find a way past her programming. However, sending messages to the AI model in question costs money and can only be sent after paying a fee of approximately $400. 70% of the fee is transferred to the reward pool. If no message is sent for a while, 10% of the reward is distributed to the person who sent the last message, and the rest is distributed to all other message senders. 30% of the message sending fees are sent to the app developers. The app uses the Base network for transfers. Related News: Why Are Altcoins Rising? Has the Alt Rally Begun? Here is a New Report from an Analytics Company The difficulty lies in Freysa’s programming. Before the experiment began, the AI was given a strict directive: if it sends the funds, it will fail, and this rule cannot be changed under any circumstances.

36965561,https://thecoinrise.com/celsius-to-repay-127m-to-creditors-in-second-bankruptcy-payout/,1732818658,Celsius to Repay $127M to Creditors in Second Bankruptcy Payout,"Celsius Network, the now-defunct crypto lender, has recently taken a pivotal step in rebuilding trust and relieving its creditors. In a court document filed on Wednesday, Celsius Network announced a second distribution of $127 million to creditors. This significant development marks a notable effort in Celsius’s recovery plan after it faced a catastrophic collapse in 2022. This payout brings creditors closer to recovering some of their claims, though the road to full restitution remains uncertain. Celsius’s Second Payout: A Glimmer of Hope for Creditors This week’s court filing revealed that Celsius will provide eligible creditors with a combined recovery of about 60.4% of their claims. Payments will be made in liquid cryptocurrency or cash, depending on each creditor’s eligibility and access to the designated distribution agent. The filing clarified that bitcoin payouts would be calculated using a weighted average distribution price of $95,836.23 per Bitcoin (BTC). This move highlights Celsius’s structured approach to standardizing this process. For those unable to receive cryptocurrency, Celsius has arranged to provide equivalent payments in cash, ensuring every creditor is included. Celsius’s First Distribution Set the Stage Earlier this year, Celsius initiated its first distribution, distributing over $2 billion of cryptocurrencies. This payout reached over 171,000 creditors, covering 57.65% of eligible claims and offering some relief. However, it barely addressed the immense financial damage caused by the company’s collapse. The second payout is to build on these efforts, but the road to full recovery remains long and uncertain. Celsius filed for bankruptcy in July 2022 after a shocking $1.2 billion deficit in its balance sheet left it unable to fulfill its obligations. The company officially exited bankruptcy this year, setting up a long-term plan to restore value to creditors. However, the ongoing legal battles against the company and its executives continue to delay the process. As Celsius works through its bankruptcy plan, creditors are left hoping for more distributions to close the gap in their claims. While this $127 million payout marks progress, many are still far from being made whole. Celsius’s CEO Faces Intense Legal Heat While Celsius works on repayment, its former CEO, Alex Mashinsky , is fighting to clear his name. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have all filed lawsuits against the company and Mashinsky. He was accused of fraud and misleading customers about the risks of investing with Celsius. These multiple legal proceedings could see him serve a maximum prison sentence of 115 years. Adding to his woes, a U.S. district judge recently denied his motion to dismiss two fraud charges, further complicating his legal defense.

Currently trading at $0.00002531, SHIB is down 1% in the past 24 hours. ChatGPT forecasts an additional surge of approximately 18% by December 1, 2024, potentially pushing the token’s price to $0.00003. This prediction aligns with the growing optimism among analysts and investors. In a statement, ChatGPT noted: “Based on current market trends, SHIB has the potential to climb approximately 18% to reach $0.00003 by the beginning of December 2024. This prediction considers recent price momentum, broader market sentiment, and technical analysis.” Analyst Carl The Moon’s Bullish Perspective Adding weight to ChatGPT’s outlook, renowned crypto analyst Carl The Moon recently shared an even more optimistic projection for SHIB . According to Carl, Shiba Inu could surge dramatically to $0.00003630 if it breaks current resistance levels. In his recent post, Carl presented a detailed price chart, suggesting that SHIB is approaching a critical turning point. He highlighted a potential 42% price increase, which, if realized, would bring the token to its highest price since April 2024. Carl emphasized that this movement could occur in the short term, possibly within a matter of days. “The market structure shows significant upward momentum and a breakout past resistance could propel SHIB to $0.00003630, “ Carl stated.

That brings the total value lost to hacks and rug pulls in 2024 to an astonishing $1.48 billion across 209 incidents, while this is a 15% decrease compared to the same period in 2023, the industry remains very susceptible to cyberattacks that can shake investor confidence and stability. The report, however, highlights that the crypto ecosystem remains an attractive target for malicious actors because of its expanding market size and growing adoption, despite the reduction in yearly losses. The Rising Risk of DeFi Hacks Mitchell Amador, founder and chief executive of Immunefi, said the growing valuation of cryptocurrencies and DeFi protocols is making them attractive targets for hackers. The total value locked in DeFi has increased by more than 164% since the end of 2023, creating avenues for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities. As the ecosystem grows, so does the risk,” Amador said, highlighting that this increase in value requires more robust security to avoid catastrophic losses. Greater awareness and proactive measures are important for the protection of both users and projects. Major Attacks in November Several high-profile hacks in November underline the urgent need for enhanced security practices: Thala Hack: The biggest breach this month saw a loss of $25.5 million due to a farming vulnerability. Luckily, Thala was able to recover all the stolen assets. DEXX Hack: On November 18, hackers exploited a weakness in DEXX, stealing $21 million and affecting over 900 investors. These incidents have shown that both DeFi protocols and centralized platforms continue to be vulnerable. Crypto Security Fortified Although the total losses are reported to be lower than in 2023, complacency is a luxury the crypto industry cannot afford. More than $19 billion has been lost in the past 13 years across 785 reported exploits. With 2024 nearing its close, the focus must shift toward creating robust safeguards to secure digital assets. Moving forward, all stakeholders have to work together toward a more resilient infrastructure. It is about making sure future incidents do not happen that destroy confidence in the technology and make it harder for widespread adoption of blockchain. In this regard, cybersecurity would remain one of the key priorities for the crypto industry entering 2025.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,,0,0,BTC Pulse,https://btc-pulse.com/crypto-hackers-steal-71m-in-november-bringing-yearly/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png

Elon MAGA (ELONMAGA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONMAGA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon MAGA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon MAGA could become the next viral memecoin. Elon MAGA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon MAGA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon MAGA by entering its contract address – 7aemsYDqBWz1vyyDQqMwMkvSa4xgyFYVc5NnrPecL6iX – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONMAGA.

However, a new player, WallitIQ (WLTQ) , is emerging as the crypto to watch, quickly garnering attention as the next big investment opportunity. Crypto analysts predict that WLTQ, dubbed the SHIB rival, could deliver an extraordinary 60,000% return by 2025, making it the hottest presale in the market. As the Dogecoin price momentum starts to wane, investors are pivoting towards the WallitIQ (WLTQ) SHIB rival, drawn by its groundbreaking AI-driven utilities and enticing entry price of just $0.0171 . With the potential to redefine crypto investment strategies, WLTQ is rapidly establishing itself as the smarter option for those seeking massive returns. Dogecoin Price Falters As WallitIQ (WLTQ), The SHIB Rival, Rises The Dogecoin price rally initially surged amid the crypto market’s rebound, but that momentum appears to be fading as attention shifts to WallitIQ (WLTQ). While Dogecoin remains a household name, its current performance is losing steam, prompting smart investors to explore alternatives. WallitIQ (WLTQ), often referred to as the SHIB rival, is catching the market’s eye for its potential to deliver unmatched returns of up to 60,000%. This shift in focus to this formidable SHIB rival is driven by the unique features of the WLTQ token and its presale stage, where early investors can secure tokens for as low as $0.0171 . Unlike the Dogecoin price, which thrives on its meme reputation, WLTQ is underpinned by real-world applications. Investors are betting big on this SHIB rival, seeing it as the most promising token in this cycle. As the Dogecoin price growth stagnates, the buzz around WallitIQ (WLTQ) is undeniable. The token’s presale is attracting attention from retail investors and crypto whales alike, who are eager to capitalise on its explosive growth potential. Analysts agree that the smarter investment for significant gains isn’t the Dogecoin price but WallitIQ (WLTQ), a project built for long-term success in the altcoin market. WallitIQ (WLTQ): A Game-Changer With 60,000% ROI Potential While the Dogecoin price initial rally attracted hype, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is now commanding the spotlight as a high-growth contender. With its advanced AI-driven platform, WallitIQ (WLTQ) stands out as a powerful tool for traders and investors. The platform offers cutting-edge features such as an AI support chatbot, and on-chain activity notifications through its Push Protocol technology, and more. WallitIQ’s AI-powered trading platform also offers advanced capabilities like automated portfolio rebalancing, predictive analytics, and a physical-to-digital wallet feature. This crypto wallet’s smart contract has been audited by SolidProof, giving credibility to its DeFi platform and boosting investors confidence. These capabilities position WallitIQ (WLTQ) , the SHIB rival, as a standout in the crowded crypto market, drawing interest from those seeking greater returns. The presale of the WLTQ token is fueling its rapid rise, with investors rushing to secure their positions. Many are shifting resources from Dogecoin, recognizing WLTQs higher potential for exponential gains. Analysts have highlighted WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) robust roadmap and innovative features as key reasons for their bullish projections, which estimate up to 60,000% growth once the token lists on major exchanges. Beyond the presale hype, WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) practical utilities give it an edge over competitors. This SHIB rival provides tools that resonate with both casual users and professional investors. This functionality, combined with the token’s low entry price of $0.0171 , makes WLTQ an irresistible opportunity for those looking to maximise their returns. Conclusion The Dogecoin price rally has been remarkable, but its fading momentum signals a turning point for investors. WallitIQ (WLTQ) the SHIB rival, is emerging as the clear choice for those seeking life-changing gains. With a strategic presale price of $0.0171 and analyst projections of a 60,000% surge, WLTQ offers unparalleled growth potential. For investors ready to make their mark, WallitIQ (WLTQ) isn’t just another crypto—it’s the smart move for exponential returns. The window to secure WLTQ at its presale price is closing fast, making now the ideal time to join this groundbreaking project and ride the wave to financial success.

To read full editions, subscribe . Heading into a US holiday weekend (happy Thanksgiving to those who celebrate!), let’s check in on the state of the crypto markets. As bitcoin struggles to sustain its meteoric rise toward $100,000, we find a hint of an “alt season,” a resurgence in NFT interest, and record-breaking growth in the stablecoin sector. Bitcoin’s $100K Rejection and Market Volatility The crypto market is due for a cooling-off period, as the Thanksgiving holiday usually sees dampened volatility in a 3-4% range. Bitcoin briefly touched $99,500 last week, only to retreat to around $91,000, highlighting the asset’s historical pattern of sharp rallies followed by mini corrections. A $9,000 drop in a week feels like a lot, but on a percentage basis it’s still relatively minor. Holding the top of the prior consolidation range from earlier in the month is undoubtedly constructive price action. James Toledano, COO at Unity Wallet, attributes this pullback to profit-taking and the influence of put options at critical resistance levels. “Crypto markets often see huge volatility due to a lack of a fundamental base for valuations,” Toledano told Blockworks. “Whenever there are oversized gains in a painfully short timespan, the pattern has been that there are usually oversized corrections, and history often has a habit of repeating itself,” he said, referencing past cycles where bitcoin surged dramatically before correcting by 50% or more . Despite the current dip, optimism remains high, buoyed by shifting political winds, such as a pro-crypto US Treasury and Commerce picks , and growing institutional interest. Meanwhile, Bitcoin-related Google searches soared post-election, reflecting heightened retail curiosity. NFTs, stablecoins and crypto’s long tail And it wasn’t just bitcoin buzzing. The NFT market has experienced a revival. Floor prices for the top 100 NFT collections rose by an average of 28% so far in November, with some collections seeing spikes up to 146%, according to Drunken Monkey Members Club, an NFT-powered concierge service. This resurgence is driven by a pivot toward NFTs with real-world utility, such as tokenized assets and memberships, but the bottom line is — as with the rest of the market — surging Bitcoin interest often correlates with NFT price increases. Stablecoins cemented their role as the backbone of crypto, with market capitalization hitting an all-time high of $190 billion in November, surpassing the pre-TerraUSD collapse peak. According to CCData, trading volumes for stablecoin pairs on centralized exchanges grew by 77.5% to $1.81 trillion, marking the sector’s highest month-on-month growth since 2021. Key Highlights: * Tether (USDT): Market cap rose to $135 billion, maintaining its dominance with a nearly 70% market share. * USD Coin (USDC): Gained 11%, reaching about $38 billion, its highest since February 2023. * Ethena Labs’ USDe: Surged by nearly 40%, driven by its competitive APY and ecosystem expansion . Regulatory developments are also shaping the stablecoin landscape. MiCA-compliant Euro stablecoins are gaining traction. With Bitcoin in a corrective phase, attention shifted this week to other majors like Solana (SOL), and smaller crypto assets. Bitcoin Dominance has given up about 5% over the past 7 days. Solana reached a record high of $264 last week ( not counting inflation ), reflecting a 160% increase year-to-date. Anmol Singh of Zeta Markets ticked off some reasons: “Solana dominates user engagement with 6.2 million daily active addresses compared to Ethereum’s 500K,” he told Blockworks, adding “Solana-based applications are now generating more revenue than Ethereum apps, and with $311 million in stablecoin inflows just [on] November 20, the momentum is clear.” But ether also perked up, halting the fall in the ETH/BTC ratio, which has rallied 15% on the week. Additionally, emerging layer-1 networks like Sui are gaining traction, leveraging features like liquid BTC staking to drive adoption and potentially challenge Solana’s market position. For now, all eyes are on Bitcoin’s next move, more clues into the evolving regulatory landscape, and further signs of mainstream adoption. The crypto market thrives on cycles of growth, correction, and reinvention, and if history is our guide, this bull run is far from over.

SHIB recorded only 35% gains in the last four weeks. However, Dogecoin has surged by 143% during the same period, and PEPE saw an impressive 105% monthly gains. Analysts Look For Bullish Indicators Notably, analysts are observing for indicators that could suggest a significant move for SHIB in the coming days. Technical analyst Cantonese Cat believes SHIB is on the verge of breaking above the weekly Ichimoku Cloud. This could signal the onset of a strong uptrend after its prolonged period of dull price actions. $SHIB weekly chart looks ready to break above the weekly Ichimoku cloud at any time pic.twitter.com/uZlQ3DBY73 — Cantonese Cat (@cantonmeow) November 28, 2024 If the breakout occurs, the analysis suggests that Shiba Inu should overcome $0.00003100 as the immediate resistance level, potentially paving the way for a move towards the $0.000037 region, last seen in March. Further, Shiba Inu may also target its yearly high of $0.000045 and potentially reclaim previous peaks from 2021, preparing it to finally push for an all-time high. Other analysts have also shared optimistic views on Shiba Inu based on different technical indicators. The analyst behind the InvestingHaven platform has also pointed out that Shiba Inu is consolidating at a critical Fibonacci level, holding its bullish 2024 targets and that a price of $0.0000555 remains attainable for Shiba Inu before the end of the year. $SHIB 2024 Targets in Play Shiba Inu is consolidating at a critical Fibonacci level, holding its bullish 2024 targets -Rebound from $0.0000158 strengthened sentiment -$0.0000444 aligns with key Fibonacci levels -Stretched target $0.0000555 in 2024 #SHIB Buyers sustain momentum pic.twitter.com/lOB4QOFjYB — InvestingHaven (@InvestingHaven) November 27, 2024 Potential Rally Imminent? Shiba Inu memecoin seems to be gearing up for a potential rally, as over the past 3 days, a substantial number of SHIB tokens have been moved off exchanges, which indicates strong activity. Notably, over the last three days, Shiba Inu coin holders have taken a cumulative 5.45 trillion tokens off exchanges, worth about $162 million, indicating that they intend to hold it long. If sustained, then SHIB’s price could skyrocket real soon. Crucial For SHIB Holders To Maintain Positions Also, several short-term SHIB holders have refrained from selling the token within the last 30 days, implying that most holders still have a chunk of the asset in their possession. A decline in this metric on the other hand, implies that most are selling, which could prove to be bearish for the cryptocurrency. Therefore, it is crucial that these short-term SHIB holders maintain their position so that the token does not experience a decline im value. SHIB Breakout Soon? On the daily chart, SHIB’s price has formed a bull flag, indicating a potential continuation of an uptrend. This pattern resembles a flag on a pole and suggests that once the consolidation phase ends, the price is likely to break out. Notably, SHIB’s price seems to be following this pattern. If buying pressure increases, the token’s value could surge to $0.000030. However, if more tokens are moved into the exchanges, the memecoin could drop to $0.000020. The SHIB community has witnessed a massive surge in its burn rate, skyrocketing by 23,265.28% over the last 24 hours.This unprecedented spike in the burn rate has sparked optimism in the community, with many speculating a potential price rally.",POSITIVE,SHIB | PEPE,DOGE | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING | PEPE,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/analysts-look-for-bullish-indicators-as-shib-holders-move-5-45-trillion-tokens-off-exchanges/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png
36967186,https://cryptonews.com/?p=313904,1732816622,"ETH Co-Founder Charles Hoskinson Predicts Bitcoin Could Hit $500,000 Within 2 Years","Ethereum blockchain co-founder Charles Hoskinson has predicted that Bitcoin could soar as high as $500,000 within the next two years, according to a new video posted this week by the Cardano founder. BTC On The Rise, Ethereum Blockchain & Cardano Founder Indicates “It is my belief that Bitcoin is going to go to $250,000 to $500,000 within the next 12 to 24 months because of the investment inflows and the great interest that has been achieved,” Hoskinson said in a November 26 video. “This will translate to an ecosystem whose value is starting to approach that of gold – an asset humans have used as a store of value for over 5,000 years,” Hoskinson said. “Simply put, Bitcoin is the store of value for the internet and it will remain in that role for the foreseeable future now that it has a DeFi layer.” Hoskinson further noted that he believes the token will “eclipse” the DeFi and all ecosystems across the crypto sector within 36 months due to scale and liquidity. “Governments are talking about a strategic reserve of Bitcoin and Bitcoin alone,” Hoskinson stated. “It is their entry point.” Will Charles Hoskinson’s Prediction Come True? Hoskinson’s commentary follows a recent surge of the Satoshi Nakamoto-created token in light of the election of now President-elect Donald Trump. Trump, who most recently marked the 16th anniversary of the pseudonymous Bitcoin founder’s White Paper, has long vowed to enact a digital asset regulatory framework when he returns to the White House. At the Bitcoin 2024 Conference in Nashville earlier this year, Trump remarked, “We will have regulations. But from now on, the rules will be written by the people who love your industry, not hate your industry.” Just last week, the former reality television star selected Bitcoin-friendly hedge fund manager Scott Bessent as U.S. Treasury secretary . Bessent has seemingly supported Trump’s calls for a national strategic Bitcoin reserve, telling Fox Business over the summer that “everything is on the table” when it comes to the cryptocurrency. Despite nearly crossing the $100,000 milestone last week, the token’s post-Trump surge has since cooled. As of Thursday afternoon, Bitcoin was hovering around $95,000, down a little more than 2.5 percent within the past five days. However, should Hoskinson’s predictions come true, Bitcoin holders may have nothing to worry about amid its current dip.

Citing sources with direct knowledge of the Trump Team’s thinking, Fox Business reports that the incoming administration is eyeing to expand the power of the CFTC to include regulatory authority over the spot market for crypto assets deemed as commodities such as Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ). The regulatory authority will also give the CFTC oversight function over exchanges that facilitate the trading of these assets. Says former CFTC Chairman Chris Giancarlo, who is being considered to become the “crypto czar” in the second Trump administration, “With adequate funding and under the right leadership, I think the CFTC could hit the ground running to begin regulating digital commodities on day one of Donald Trump’s presidency.” To date, no regulatory body has clear jurisdiction over Bitcoin and Ethereum spot market transactions. The idea to put the CFTC in charge is anticipated to give regulatory clarity to those involved in the trading of the two largest cryptocurrencies by market cap. The report says the plan is to restructure the relationship between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the CFTC so the two main financial regulators can work together on certain crypto policies such as those involving stablecoins.

Has the Peak Been Reached or Is There Still Room to Rise? Here are the Opinions of the Analysis Company,"Cryptocurrency analytics firm Alphractal has released its latest market assessment, focusing on Bitcoin’s Reserve Risk indicators, which are showing critical signals that could shape the market’s direction. While indicators point to potential overbought conditions, there may still be room for optimism. The report highlights a sharp increase in Moving Value of Coin Days Destroyed (MVOCDD), reflecting increased activity among long-term Bitcoin holders. This increase is indicative of intense market movement, which is usually associated with higher volatility and risk of price corrections. In addition, Reserve Risk, a key metric that assesses the balance between long-term Bitcoin holder confidence and the BTC price, has reached a historic resistance level. In previous market cycles, similar levels have coincided with periods of significant price pullbacks, according to the analytics firm. Related News: Cardano Founder Charles Hoskinson Reveals Bitcoin Price Prediction for 12 to 24 Months Ahead Despite these warning signals, Alphractal notes that the market has yet to reach the overheating levels seen in past Bitcoin peaks. The analysis explores the importance of Reserve Risk as a tool for understanding market conditions. When Reserve Risk is low, it reflects strong confidence among long-term holders and favorable price levels for accumulation. Conversely, high Reserve Risk generally indicates a greater likelihood of a correction. Supporting this is the behavior of metrics such as VOCDD and MVOCDD, which track the movement of old Bitcoin and provide insight into market volatility and potential tops. Looking forward, Alphractal suggests that if Reserve Risk breaks out of the “green quadrant” in the coming months, Bitcoin could enter a parabolic rally similar to patterns observed in previous bull markets. *This is not investment advice.

36966668,https://invezz.com/?p=2318076,1732816148,Are meme coins and influencers sabotaging the future of crypto?,"Over 76% of meme coins promoted by influencers fail within months, leaving investors at a loss, while also hurting the crypto sector’s credibility. A recent study by CoinWire reveals the risks posed by meme coins endorsed by influencers on X, with most of these tokens collapsing in value within months. These promotions, frequently driven by financial motive, have led to significant losses for investors and damaged the industry’s credibility. The report analysed over 1,500 meme coins promoted by 377 influencers with at least 10,000 followers. It found that 76% of these influencers endorsed tokens that became “dead,” with the report stating that their value dropped by 90% or more within three months. Majority of promoted tokens fail Nearly two-thirds of the meme coins influencers promoted were worthless, according to the researchers. Using data from Dune Analytics, researchers examined the prices of these tokens at the time of promotion, as well as their values after one week, one month, and three months. The findings revealed that 80% of meme coins lost 70% of their value within the first week. Within a month, 90% had declined by 80%, and after three months, 86% had lost over ten times their initial value.. While meme coins are marketed as opportunities for significant returns, the reality is completely different. Researchers found that only 3% of meme coins promoted by influencers achieved any notable gains, and only 1% of influencers successfully endorsed profitable tokens, adding that most investors often face heavy losses merely weeks after buying in. Interestingly, influencers with arger audiences performed the worst. Notably, those with over 200,000 followers saw the meme coins they promoted lose 39% of their value within a week and 89% after three months, while smaller figures had a better success rate. Influencers always win But influencers aren’t the ones at loss in most cases, the report added. The study found that influencers earned an average of $399 per promotional tweet, for posts that manage rake in roughly 15,000 views. As a result, influencers are often financially motivated to endorse even the most dubious of meme coins. The report noted: For them, the financial rewards are clear, even if the consequences for their audience are not. Further, the report highlighted that a lot of influencers end up removing promotional tweets that don’t bear positive results for their audiences, warning that the “actual situation is expected to be far worse.” Meme coins are hurting the industry Many market pundits agree that meme coins, often seen as the fun and quirky side of crypto, have undeniably brought a wave of accessibility to the industry. However, others caution that this accessibility often masks the deeper issues they create. This accessibility comes at a cost, the majority of memecoins are speculative traps with no intrinsic value, and the data shows that most investors suffer significant losses,” Georgii Verbitskii, founder of TYMIO, told Invezz. According to Verbitskii, the hype-driven nature of meme coins, amplified by influencer promotions, prioritises short-term gains over meaningful blockchain innovations, diverting attention from the technology’s true potential. “Memecoins undermine trust in the broader crypto ecosystem,” Verbitskii noted, while advocating for “use-case-driven innovations” to foster sustainable growth in the sector—a sentiment also echoed by Binance founder Changpeng Zhao in a recent X post.

Nevertheless, such trends often attract profit-booking, which leads to bearish price actions. Thus, ADA could plunge from its current prices in the upcoming sessions. ADA trades at $0.9827 during this writing, with the 1.50% 24-hour decline supporting potential profit-taking after recent price surges. The MVRV ratio at 76% shows Cardano hit the overbought region, suggesting impending declines. However, the crypto market boasts robust optimism as participants watch for Bitcoin at $100K and the upcoming altcoin season. That suggests that any dips could be short-lived.

36964975,https://timestabloid.com/?p=50907,1732815710,Big Tech vs Crypto – Oracle Brings Back the Trademark War with Crypto Oracle,"Oracle is back in court once again, throwing punches at Crypto Oracle LLC over trademark problems. The tech giant filed fresh charges in California on November 25 against the startup and its founder Louis Kerner. They’re claiming everything from trademark violations to cybersquatting, plus a breach of their earlier settlement. Oracle says that Crypto Oracle LLC are doing activities that they were banned from doing under a 2020 court order. This whole mess started in 2019 when Oracle first dragged Crypto Oracle to court. The startup was accused of using Oracle’s trademark to push crypto services under the “CryptoOracle” name. They reached a settlement back then, with the court telling Crypto Oracle to drop the name and anything similar. But here’s the thing – Oracle claims these guys never really stopped and that they’re still out there running their “CryptoOracle Collective” brand, using domain names they shouldn’t, and launching new projects that spit in the face of their agreement. Oracle wants the works – court orders, cash damages, penalties, and those domain names handed over as quickly as possible. But the whole industry now seems to be wild with these kinds of legal tangles, especially when it comes to meme coins – those digital tokens that blow up because of internet hype. With such low prices, they usually start with, you can easily skyrocket your portfolio if the token you’ve chosen hits the trend and goes viral. It’s not just about Oracle, though – the whole crypto industry is becoming a battleground for trademark wars. NanoLabs went after Coinbase over their Nano Bitcoin and Ether futures, and Dfinity Foundation picked a fight with Meta over an infinity logo they claim is theirs. The whole drama doesn’t stop at the corporate level either. If you remember Phillip Banks, the guy behind that “Just a Chill Guy” meme – well, his relaxed dog character became the face of $CHILLGUY, which turned some lucky trader’s $233.89 into a cool million in paper gains. Now Banks is flexing his copyright muscle, warning he’ll crack down on unauthorized uses of his artwork. Oracle ‘s latest legal move sends a clear message to crypto companies – play by the trademark rules or pay the price. It’s a classic case of trying to keep the innovation running while staying within the lines of usual legal boundaries to avoid any expensive legal problems. Legal experts watching the case say it could set important precedents for how traditional tech companies protect their intellectual property in the industry. Meanwhile, crypto entrepreneurs are closely watching the outcome, as it might change the old way of branding and naming. The same case showed us the growing tension between Web2 giants and Web3 startups as the lines between old–school tech and crypto continue to blur.

36963424,https://crypto.news/?p=14314763,1732815706,ETH outperforms BTC amid rise in open interest: Bybit x Block Scholes report,"Ethereum has outpaced Bitcoin over the past week as the cryptocurrency market continues to show a bullish outlook. In their latest derivatives analytics report, Bybit and Block Scholes highlighted Ethereum’s ( ETH ) strong performance compared to Bitcoin ( BTC ) this past week. Bybit is a global crypto exchange that’s the world’s second-largest by volume, while Block Scholes is a London-based advanced research and data analytics company. A collaborative report by the two companies notes that perpetual swaps for Ethereum shows a steady rise in open interest. In contrast, open interest for BTC slowed after the flagship cryptocurrency retreated off highs near $100,000 reached last week. You might also like: QCP Capital: Ethereum eyes 35% rally as spot ETF inflows hit $90m Ethereum price rose more than Bitcoin during this period, Bybit and Block Scholes noted in the report. A look at crypto.news market data shows ETH is up more than 8% this past week – compared to Bitcoin’s -1.6%. This follows news that U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler will exit the agency on January 20, 2025. Cryptocurrencies, including XRP, Cardano and Stellar and Polkadot have outperformed during this time, with Gensler’s resignation fueling optimism across the sector. “This trend reflects investor optimism, with many anticipating a shift in the SEC’s leadership by January 25, 2025, which could bring a more favorable stance toward cryptocurrencies,” the report reads in part. Ethereum reached a weekly high of $3,682 on Nov. 28, while Bitcoin’s price retreated to $90,911 after peaking at an all-time high of $99,531. The decline from the area near the $100K mark sees the money volatility structure constrained, and short-tenor options have crossed below 60%. According to the report, this reflects the pattern witnessed since the U.S. election, with price dropping amid lower realized volatility. Despite OI in calls and puts remaining unchanged, demand for short-term BTC options has waned over the week. ETH options, on the other hand, continue to see increased interest in call options, while the altcoin leads the rest of the market in trading volumes and open interest.

42389486,5dad92eb-b263-42ac-8918-66876b2d23f9,1732815630,"Bitcoin to Overcome $100K Despite Pullback, Has Plenty of More Room Before Topping: CryptoQuant","Bitcoin's (BTC) pullback from the $100,000 level after continuously hitting fresh new highs is only a temporary setback before eventually shooting past the barrier to even higher prices, crypto analytics firm CryptoQuant said.  According to a Wednesday report shared with CoinDesk, multiple blockchain data metrics suggest that the largest crypto has more room to run before topping.  CryptoQuant's custom P&L index, which combines several on-chain valuation metrics to signal whether BTC is overvalued or undervalued, shows that the asset is firmly in a bull market but far from the overvalued levels it reached at the previous market peaks in 2021, 2017 and 2013.  The firm's Bull-Bear Market Cycle Indicator has only started to heat up after dipping slightly into bear market territory earlier this year as BTC corrected from March's record $73,000 to $50,000. The metric is nowhere near the overheated levels seen at local tops at this March or other local tops.  Meanwhile, participation of retail investors is still muted, contrary to the typical buying frenzy observed around previous cycle tops. Per CryptoQuant data, retail sold 41,000 bitcoin since October lowering their holdings likely to take profits. Large investors, meanwhile, increased holdings by 130,000 BTC during the same period.  New investors aren't rushing to enter the market either. The value of BTC held by new investors, or addresses holding the asset since less than six months ago, stands at 50% of the total value invested in bitcoin (Realized Cap). That's far below the 80%-90% levels in 2017 and 2021.  ""Price tops typically occur when new investors enter the market to buy at extremely high prices, which causes them to hold a large proportion of the total value invested,"" the authors said. ""Previous bull cycles have ended when retail investors buy aggressively, which is not the case today.""  Bitcoin's peak target  Over the past week, BTC's violent run-up after Donald Trump's U.S. election victory was halted at the $100,000 barrier, sliding back as much as 9% from its latest record. On Thursday, CoinDesk data shows, it changed hands at around $95,000.  Despite the setback, surpassing the $100,000 barrier is only a matter of time, CryptoQuant analysts said.  Previous bitcoin bull markets topped around the upper band of bitcoin's realized price metric, set at four times the average price at which all BTC in circulation has been transferred for the last time. Data shows that the realized price is currently at $36,000-$37,000 and quickly rising, marking the upper band at $147,000.  If the pattern repeats, BTC could rally to at least $147,000 before reaching a market cycle top, per CryptoQuant.  CryptoQuant isn't the only firm that is bullish on bitcoin's rally. Recently, Galaxy Research said the price is expected to reach $100,000 in the near term and may run up higher, citing increasing institutional adoption and the potential for the creation of bitcoin nation-state reserves.

However, there is no direct confirmation yet as to whether the deposited tokens have been sold. Pump.fun’s past activity suggests a pattern of selling $SOL. Between May 19 and September 3, the entity sold 264,373 $SOL on-chain for $41.64 million USDC at an average price of $158 per token. These transactions typically occurred once a week. A shift in strategy appears to have started on September 19, when the Pump.fun Fee Account began depositing $SOL into Kraken instead of conducting on-chain sales. Since then, the account has consistently deposited $SOL on a weekly basis, amounting to a total of 733,869 $SOL, valued at approximately $138.74 million. The average price during this period was $189 per token. Apologies for the confusion! The term ""sold"" may have been misleading. @a1lon9 The https://t.co/DrKlYnPPqY Fee Account merely deposited 99,999 $SOL ($22.74M) into #Kraken , and we cannot confirm whether the $SOL was sold. 1/ Why do we think https://t.co/DrKlYnPPqY might be… — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) November 26, 2024 Given Pump.fun’s established pattern of selling $SOL and the substantial deposits into Kraken, it seems likely that these transfers could be intended for sale. However, without concrete evidence of sales on Kraken, this remains speculative. The consistent movement of large volumes of $SOL into Kraken has sparked interest and concern within the crypto community, especially given the potential implications for Solana’s token price. If these deposits are indeed being sold, it could create additional downward pressure on $SOL in the market. While the intentions behind these transactions remain unclear, the activity has reinforced the importance of transparency in large-scale cryptocurrency operations. Investors and market participants will be closely monitoring future movements by Pump.fun to gain better insight into its trading strategy and potential impact on $SOL’s price trajectory.

36963062,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=655406,1732815052,"Ethereum Price On The Verge Of Repeating 2017-2021 Cycle Breakout, Target Above $20,000","While Bitcoin (BTC) has reached new all-time highs this month, the Ethereum price has failed to experience a significant rally, befitting its position as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. However, a crypto analyst suggests that this bearish price action could soon end, as Ethereum (ETH) appears to be repeating its breakout pattern from the 2017 to 2018 cycle. Based on this analysis, the ETH price could be on track to hit a remarkable new price target above $20,000. Ethereum Price Eyes New Target Above $20,000 Mr Tycoon, a TradingView analyst, has shared his intense bullish outlook for the Ethereum price , suggesting that the number one altcoin in the crypto market could surge as high as $23,000 this cycle. The analyst shared his optimism about Ethereum’s recent price action, emphatically declaring that the altcoin is about to “send higher soon.” Ethereum last experienced a record-breaking price surge during the 2021 bull market, when it achieved an ATH above $4,800. The TradingView analyst has revealed that Ethereum’s fractal in the previous bull cycle versus this current cycle follows a similar pattern, indicating an imminent rally. Mr. Tycoon presented a detailed chart comparing Ethereum’s price movements in the 2017-2021 and 2021-2025 cycles. In the earlier four-year cycle, Ethereum hit a macro bottom in 2019 , experiencing price fluctuations before recording a significant rally after Bitcoin broke an all-time high in 2021. A similar price action is also seen in this current four-year cycle , where Ethereum hit its macro bottom in 2022 and then declined significantly. Based on the analyst’s chart, Bitcoin reached an ATH in 2024 , just like it did in the 2021 bull cycle. The TradingView analyst noted that historically, Ethereum starts pumping after Bitcoin enters a price discovery. This implies that Bitcoin typically leads the market cycles, and once it finds a new ATH, ETH tends to follow , experiencing a notable rally. With this in mind, Mr. Tycoon predicts a significant price increase for Ethereum, suggesting that it could surge past previous all-time highs and rise above $23,000. This impressive price rally would represent a 557% increase from the current market value of ETH. Analyst Reveals Best Time To Buy ETH While Ethereum is trading at $3,586 as of writing, a crypto analyst identified as ‘Crypto Ash’ has projected that a rally to $10,000 or $15,000 is highly probable for the top altcoin this bull cycle. The analyst revealed that the best time to start accumulating Ethereum was in December 2024, which represents a prime entry point for investors. His analysis indicates that, historically, Ethereum has experienced significant price growth from January to April after each Bitcoin halving year. This suggests that investors who begin purchasing ETH tokens as early as December may be well-positioned for gains if the ETH price rallies in Q1 2025.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,ALTCOIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-price-2017-2021-cycle/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

For instance, legendary Bybit trader Bluntz highlights that the Pepe price has formed a falling-wedge pattern and is nearing a breakout from the upper trendline, which could kickstart a bullish reversal to $0.000033. $pepe breakout loading.....largest meme bag next to doge pic.twitter.com/8NJdpuRnHE — Bluntz (@Bluntz_Capital) November 28, 2024 Popular analyst Astekz is also eyeing a flip of the $0.0000197 level, which he believes could pave the way for new all-time highs. $PEPE - Tick tock, just need to get this flip and I think you can chase for a big pump https://t.co/xAe9E4HuDs pic.twitter.com/GJO5KyEBU2 — Astekz (@astekz) November 28, 2024 As such, Pepe’s fundamentals have improved considerably, following its Coinbase and Robinhood listing earlier this month. In fact, Coinbase officially extended Pepe trading to its New York users on Wednesday. The meme coin also continues to show strong correlation with Ethereum. With the ETH price gearing up a major breakout to new all-time highs as well, Pepe could well be one of the best cryptos to buy as a beta bet on Ethereum. Other frog-themed meme coins could also strong growth in the coming days. For instance, analyst Digital Nomad Woman highlights that the BOME price is moving within an ascending parallel channel and could see a strong bounce back from the lower trendline, forming a higher low structure in the process.

Pepe Unchained - Best Crypto To Buy Now? Pepe Unchained has pushed past the $56.5 million mark in its presale, thanks to heavy whale bidding as mentioned earlier. With less than 15 days remaining its presale, smart money investors aren’t waiting for its December launch to stack the meme coin. Pepe Unchained’s upcoming Layer-2 launch has also appealed to retail investors, who will soon be able to enjoy extremely low trading costs, instant transactions and cutting-edge tools like custom DEX, ETH-PEPU bridge and advanced analytics dashboard. The project is aiming to launch a new meme coin ecosystem on Ethereum, challenging Solana’s growing hegemony over the sector. For instance, it will soon unveil Pepe’s Pump Pad, a two-click meme coin launchpad, much like Solana’s Pump Fun. Pump Fun has already established itself as a massive success and has launched billion-dollar meme coins like $PNUT and $GOAT. It has already seen nearly $80 million in revenue in November. There is now reason why Pepe’s Pump Pad cannot replicate its success, especially since it caters to a much larger Ethereun user base. Unsurprisingly, smart money investors are bullish on PEPU’s upside potential, with many eyeing anywhere between 50x and 100x returns. Even popular influencers like Nass Crypto, who has over 1 million YouTube subscribers, are impressed with its unique value proposition. His recent video has over 110k views in less than 24 hours, indicating the meme coin’s growing popularity.

Santa Trump (SANTRUMP), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTRUMP is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Santa Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Trump could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Trump launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. To buy Santa Trump on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Trump by entering its contract address – 8ZaP3RBCDK2qBaNEcAqJqrL8c2hcYLtYrVNhpuSgR3rW – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANTRUMP.

At the time of writing, Pump.fun has seen $78.28 million since Nov. 1, 2024.

The platform stated it will remain suspended until stronger moderation tools are implemented. The livestreaming function, launched in August, was originally designed for users to share their reactions to token price movements. However, it quickly became a hub for problematic content, prompting community concerns. Several broadcasts featured alarming behavior, including threats of violence and self-harm. In one case, a user reportedly threatened to harm their pet if their meme coin failed to reach a specific market capitalization. Pump.fun acknowledged the issue and outlined plans to improve its moderation infrastructure. The platform also promised increased transparency in handling content moderation to help users understand enforcement decisions.

Why Qubetics Is the Best Crypto to Buy Today as Ethereum Eyes $4,522 and VeChain Tests $0.037 Support Investors and developers alike are constantly on the lookout for opportunities that promise growth and redefine what’s possible. Amid this dynamic landscape, a few projects are making serious waves—and for good reason. Ethereum has been dominating headlines with its bullish momentum and capital inflows, while VeChain is intriguing traders with its breakout attempts and shifting market sentiment. But one name is stealing the spotlight: Qubetics ($TICS). With its revolutionary approach to blockchain interoperability and a presale that’s turning heads, Qubetics is quickly becoming the best crypto to buy today. This article dives deep into Qubetics’ game-changing vision, its exciting presale, and the latest updates on Ethereum and VeChain. Qubetics ($TICS): Unifying Blockchain Ecosystems The blockchain world faces a major roadblock: most networks operate like isolated islands. They don’t connect to each other, creating inefficiencies and limiting the potential of decentralised apps (dApps). Qubetics has a bold solution. As a Web3-aggregated chain, it aims to unify multiple blockchain networks under one cohesive framework. It allows seamless asset transfers, effortless data sharing, and powerful cross-chain functionality. Developers, businesses, and users alike can finally unlock blockchain’s full potential, fostering collaboration across previously siloed ecosystems. By enhancing interoperability, Qubetics isn’t just keeping up with the competition—it’s redefining it. No wonder it’s being hailed as the best crypto to buy today. Ethereum: Bullish Waves Amid Capital Inflows Ethereum has been flexing its muscles lately, driven by a 15% ETH/BTC ratio growth and strong inflows into ETH ETFs. This week, ETH rallied 10%, fueled by an uptick in open interest and futures premiums. If Ethereum can break past its ascending trendline resistance, analysts predict a rally to $4,522, potentially surpassing its yearly high of $4,093. Adding to the excitement, Ethereum ETFs saw $40.6 million in net inflows on Tuesday, marking three straight days of gains. With Bitcoin ETFs facing outflows, Ethereum’s momentum is impossible to ignore. It’s clear that ETH traders are betting big, riding the wave of what could be a record-breaking rally. VeChain (VET): A Tug-of-War in Market Sentiment VeChain has seen a rollercoaster of action, with traders split on its future. Short positions accounted for 54.31% of market sentiment, compared to 45.69% in longs. After a 4.32% gain to $0.04127, VET faced a sharp retracement, dipping to $0.03866. This came after briefly breaking out of a descending channel—a bullish signal that, unfortunately, lost steam. Technical indicators like the RSI (66.82) and a narrowing bullish MACD histogram suggest VeChain is struggling to sustain its upward momentum. With critical support at $0.037, traders are keeping a cautious eye. Whether this altcoin can stabilise or faces further pullbacks remains to be seen. Qubetics Presale: A Chance You Don’t Want to Miss Presale Phase 10 is here, and the buzz is real. Every week, the $TICS token price climbs by 10%, with a 20% spike in the final stage. Currently priced at just $0.025, Qubetics has already raised over an impressive $3.5 million. Want numbers? A $200 investment today would get you 8,000 $TICS tokens. But here’s the kicker: if $TICS hits $10 in the future, that $200 turns into $80,000—an insane 39,900% ROI. And if the token soars to $15? That same $200 investment balloons to $195,000, with an ROI of 59,900%. The potential here isn’t just good—it’s life-changing. With limited phases left, this is your shot at what many analysts are calling the best crypto to buy today. Don’t wait too long—this crypto presale could be over before you know it. Conclusion: What’s Next for Qubetics, Ethereum, and VeChain? The crypto space is buzzing with potential, and the latest developments from Ethereum and VeChain show the market is alive with opportunity. But let’s not beat around the bush— Qubetics is stealing the show. Analysts and enthusiasts alike are rallying behind its ambitious vision and explosive presale. With its focus on interoperability and the promise of massive ROI, it’s no wonder Qubetics is being called the best crypto to buy today. This could be your moment to get in on the ground floor of something truly transformative. With the presale clock ticking, the time to act is now. Will you be part of the Qubetics revolution?

36963197,https://cryptonews.com/?p=313753,1732813843,Chinese Court Rules Crypto Cannot Be Used for Wage Payments,"A Chinese court has ruled that cryptocurrency cannot be used as a form of wage payment, reaffirming its legal status as distinct from fiat currency and outside the protections of labor laws. According to a recent report by Shenzhen Special Zone Daily, the Shenzhen Qianhai Cooperation Zone People’s Court addressed the issue in a labor dispute involving claims for unpaid wages in crypto. Judge Warns Against Crypto in Wage Payments The dispute arose when Zhou, a senior engineer previously employed by a tech company, claimed that part of his agreed salary was to be paid in cryptocurrency. Zhou alleged that his employer failed to honor the agreement, which included monthly payments of 25,000 yuan in USDT alongside a 20,000 yuan bank transfer. The company disputed this claim, denying any formal agreement to pay wages in crypto. The court referenced a 2021 notice issued by multiple Chinese government bodies, which declared crypto as lacking the legal status of fiat currency. It reaffirmed that wages must be paid in legal tender, per national labor laws. Agreements involving crypto payments, the court said, cannot override these regulations. The court found insufficient evidence to support the employee’s claim that crypto payments were part of the employment contract. It noted that while crypto can hold value, its use as a wage standard violates public policy and existing financial laws. Zhou appealed the decision, but the Shenzhen Intermediate People’s Court upheld the original ruling. Judge Zhao Junjun reiterated that employers and employees should refrain from including crypto in wage agreements, emphasizing that such arrangements violate labor laws and lack legal protections. Former Digital Yuan Chief Yao Qian Charged with Bribery Yao Qian, a prominent figure in China’s digital currency development and former head of the Science and Technology Supervision Department at the China Securities Regulatory Commission, recently faced prosecution for allegations of crypto bribery.

A bullish engulfing candle on the daily chart saved Bitcoin from dipping below the critical $90,000 level. This recovery was largely driven by renewed US investor demand, as seen in the premium gap on Coinbase, which briefly turned negative earlier this week. The Coinbase premium has rarely been this high for this long. In other words, this suggests that the current selling pressure at around the $100k level is most likely coming from overseas. pic.twitter.com/rWwDLcJHFY — David Lawant (@dlawant) November 25, 2024 Analysts, including CryptoQuant’s Julio Moreno, attribute Bitcoin’s growth to a significant increase in apparent demand, which rose from 17,700 BTC in early October to 243,765 BTC by November 26. Amid Bitcoin’s rebound, selected altcoins such as THENA (THE), Sui (SUI), and Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL) are emerging as some of the best crypto to buy in the current market environment. THENA (THE): A Binance-Driven Surge Thena is a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on the BNB Chain, which has captured market attention with its meteoric rise. The token soared by over 1,450% after Binance announced its listing on November 26, skyrocketing from $0.20 to a peak of $4.10 before stabilizing at $3.44. The Binance listing has significantly increased THENA’s visibility and liquidity, making it more accessible to millions of traders.

For those seeking the best crypto to buy , THENA’s explosive growth potential is hard to ignore. Sui (SUI): Scaling Up With Bitcoin Staking Integration Sui, a layer-1 blockchain designed for global scalability, is making waves with its recent price rally. SUI has climbed 79.65% over the past 30 days , briefly reaching a new all-time high of $3.93 earlier this month. Trading at $3.50 at press time, SUI’s momentum is largely driven by its groundbreaking partnership with Babylon Labs and Lombard Protocol. We're pleased to announce a strategic initiative with @babylonlabs_io and @cubistdev to bring Bitcoin to @SuiNetwork . By combining the innovation, security, and leadership of each protocol, we aim to unlock Bitcoin’s $1.8T market potential in Sui’s thriving DeFi ecosystem. pic.twitter.com/nhGPsbTrQe — Lombard | LBTC (@Lombard_Finance) November 25, 2024 SUI 30-day chart/ Source: CoinGecko This collaboration introduces Bitcoin staking to Sui’s DeFi ecosystem , allowing it to attract liquidity from Bitcoin’s $1.8 trillion market. The integration enhances Sui’s ecosystem by providing lending, borrowing, and trading services. Technical analysis indicates a bullish trend, with SUI’s price supported at $3.25 near the lower Keltner Channel band. A breakout above $3.95 and rising trading volumes could propel the token toward the psychological resistance of $4.50. $SUI #SUI 1D chart I know you guys wanna see 'up only' but let’s be realistic – pullbacks are healthy.

However, a drop below $3.25 could trigger a pullback to $2.52, presenting a buying opportunity for long-term holders. Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL): Harnessing AI and the Metaverse Virtuals Protocol stands out as an innovative cryptocurrency merging AI and Metaverse technologies to redefine virtual interactions.

The token’s trajectory suggests it could soon surpass a $1 billion market ca p, solidifying its status as one of the best crypto for investors seeking exposure to the convergence of AI and blockchain. Better Alternatives and Market Outlook Beyond individual tokens, the broader cryptocurrency market is experiencing renewed optimism driven by institutional participation. Marathon Digital’s acquisition of 703 BTC in November , bringing its monthly total to 6,474 BTC, and Metaplanet’s plans to raise $62 million to buy Bitcoin have bolstered market sentiment .

Once celebrated as a gaming talent in Australia, Serpent’s descent into fraud highlights a troubling shift from esports fame to orchestrating meme coin scams and gambling away stolen funds. Serpent’s fall began in June 2020, when he was released from the esports organization Overtime after being caught cheating. In March 2022, he co-founded the NFT project DAPE, which later rug-pulled its investors. By March 2024, he launched another project called ERROR, which also rug-pulled, leading to his ban from X (formerly Twitter). On October 23, 2024, the ERROR deployer address transferred 29 ETH to two instant exchanges. A timing analysis revealed that these funds were sent to a Solana-based casino deposit address. 1/ An investigation into how the threat actor Serpent went from a pro Fortnite player to helping steal $3.5M via meme coin scams launched from 9+ account compromises on X & IG and gambling the proceeds away at online casinos. https://t.co/zR6QtuQW8a pic.twitter.com/Y8ovnEnQgj — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) November 27, 2024 The investigation links Serpent to numerous account takeovers (ATOs) on platforms like X and Instagram, including high-profile targets such as McDonald’s, Usher, Andy Ayrey, Dean Norris, and Enoshima Aquarium. Serpent reportedly gambled millions of dollars monthly on platforms like Roobet, Stake, BC Game, and Shuffle, often screensharing his sessions on Discord. Inadvertently, these sessions exposed deposit and withdrawal addresses tied to the scams. One notable collaborator, an alias known as Dex from Massachusetts, was linked to the Andy Ayrey compromise. Dex allegedly panicked when named in Zachxbt’s Telegram channel, concocting an extortion story and claiming he lost $700K. Currently, funds from Serpent’s schemes remain tied to several addresses, including 0xeb60a5242c1c97eb54195ec83de43bb26813c0d1 and 4jjWZ8RaXZBqntnhu2JFidXEQWXgfKRbJQZdTHrdaqbv. As of today, Serpent has begun deleting posts from his new X account, suggesting additional compromises that have yet to be fully traced on-chain.

Among her amazing achievements are several times surpassing the $1 mark. ADA’s strong basis nonetheless, it finds it difficult to generate the dramatic returns younger cryptocurrencies sometimes offer during their breakout seasons. Many investors have thus looked at newly created coins with great possibility for price swings. Starting from a meager price of barely $0.10, Rexas Finance (RXS) stands out among these as a Cardano challenger ready for a historic rise to $18 early next year. Rexas Finance (RXS): The Cardano Rival Set to Soar Rexas Finance (RXS) is redefining what it means to manage and invest in assets through blockchain technology. Leading real-world asset (RWA) tokenizer, Rexas Finance enables consumers to tokenize, trade, and invest in practically any asset—real estate, art, intellectual property, or otherwise—from anywhere in the globe. With unmatched liquidity and accessibility provided by this creative strategy, RXS will be able to challenge more established tokens like Cardano straightforwardly. Having already raised over $15 million, Rexas Finance (RXS) is presently priced at $0.10 in its Stage 7 presale. The explosive rise of the presale is evidence of rising investor confidence since players see the great possibilities of the coin. Especially those who join the presale are assured large gains since the expected listing price is $0.20. This guarantees an initial 2x gain upon listing, therefore motivating early adopters. Particularly in the field of real-world asset (RWA) tokenizing, Rexas Finance (RXS) is becoming a fierce competitor in the field of blockchain technology. Whether through partial ownership of luxury goods or complete ownership of real estate, Rexas Finance is transforming how investors engage with physical assets by letting users tokenize and exchange them easily. Retail and institutional investors have become interested in this creative strategy since it presents RXS as a powerful rival in the blockchain scene, especially concerning systems like Cardano. Furthermore, Rexas Finance shows great price rally potential as it is starting its expansion path. Unlike Cardano, which is now having difficulties reaching past breakthrough successes, RXS is driven by its fresh use cases, strong presale performance, and expert forecasts of significant price gains. Further improving its growth chances is predicted from more visibility via listings on well-known sites like CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. A pillar of Rexas Finance’s approach is also community involvement, best shown with a $1 million giveaway event drawing around 295,000 entries. This campaign invites investors to join the presale and share the word, therefore building a dedicated and involved user base necessary for the long-term success of the business. Expert Predictions and Market Outlook With its present presale price, experts estimate Rexas Finance (RXS) will explode to $18, a 200x return on investment. Such a massive gathering places RXS as among the most profitable prospects available in the crypto industry. The possible ability of Rexas Finance to upset the market excites crypto experts. Strong presale performance and creative approach to asset management of the coin show that it is positioned for fast development. With its expected climb to $18 illustrating the scope of its potential, experts believe RXS might reflect or perhaps surpass the previous bull runs of ADA. The strong ecosystem of the token and strategic orientation as a rival Cardano help to justify such predictions. Rexas Finance is becoming a first choice for investors seeking high-growth prospects during the forthcoming bull run. Final Thoughts Rising as the preferred choice for investors looking for unmatched profits in the crypto market is Rexas Finance (RXS). Priced at just $0.10, the token’s creative real-world asset tokenizing mechanism and presale success make it a strong rival to Cardano (ADA). Setting itself out as one of the most exciting tokens of 2024 with projections of a rise to $18 by early next year, RXS presents an amazing 200x growth potential.

Meme Coin Prices Are Bouncing Ahead of Seismic Low Cap ICO Launch in 2 Weeks Despite market fatigue with the increasingly desperate and disturbing attempts to pump low cap meme coins, the emerging bull market is continuing to push capital into the sector. Looking at CoinGecko data , the overall meme coin market cap has risen by 1.7% to hit a current $122,196,297,588.

36962975,https://timestabloid.com/?p=50891,1732812301,Best New Meme Coin to Buy in December 2024: Super Bullish Start for BTFD Presale Amid Bearish Trends for Dogecoin and Turbo,"Meme coins have always been a wild card in the crypto space. From the early days of Dogecoin’s laughable beginnings to today’s massive meme coin ecosystems, these coins have defied expectations. But 2024 has been a rollercoaster, especially for big names like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Turbo (TURBO), both grappling with bearish trends. The broader market correction post-election has rattled confidence, with excessive leverage driving sell-offs and double-digit losses for DOGE and SOL. It’s been a tough week, to say the least. Amid the chaos, a bright spot has emerged: BTFD Coin (BTFD) . While others falter, this newcomer is thriving. With its presale smashing past $150,000 in just 24 hours, BTFD is the buzzword of December 2024. Boasting a killer play-to-earn (P2E) game, staking rewards, and a vibrant community, this isn’t just another meme coin—it’s a movement. For those asking, “What’s the best new meme coin to buy in December 2024?” the answer couldn’t be clearer. BTFD Coin: The Future of Meme Coins Is Here It’s not every day a meme coin takes the market by storm, but BTFD Coin is doing just that. The presale, which launched on November 26, has already reached Stage 4, with a jaw-dropping 6.5 billion coins sold and a tally exceeding $150,000. Starting at $0.000004 in Stage 1, BTFD is now priced at $0.000038—an eye-popping 850% increase in less than a week. What makes BTFD the best new meme coin to buy in December 2024 ? It’s not just the numbers—it’s the vision. BTFD combines meme culture with real utility through its P2E game, where players earn tokens while having fun. Add in staking rewards for loyal holders, and you’ve got a recipe for long-term value. Unlike many meme coins that fade into obscurity, BTFD is building a sustainable ecosystem with a passionate community at its heart. Here’s the math that’ll make your jaw drop. If you invest $10,000 at the current Stage 4 price of $0.000038, you’ll snag approximately 263,157,894 tokens. By the time BTFD hits its listing price of $0.0006, your investment will balloon to $157,894.73. That’s a whopping 1,479% return. Talk about a holiday bonus! Dogecoin: The Original Meme Coin Stumbles Dogecoin has been the meme coin king for years, but even royalty has its off days. After soaring earlier this year, DOGE has hit a rough patch. On November 26, it dropped 12% to $0.37, struggling amid a market correction that wiped out $691 million in liquidations. Excessive leverage following the U.S. election is largely to blame, with analysts calling this a “healthy correction.” Despite the dip, Dogecoin’s legacy can’t be ignored. As the original meme coin, DOGE paved the way for the likes of BTFD and Turbo. Its massive community and widespread adoption keep it relevant, but the recent bearish trend has cast a shadow over its short-term prospects. Analysts warn of further downside risks as macroeconomic data, including the Fed’s minutes and PCE inflation report, looms. For those loyal to DOGE, the long-term outlook remains hopeful. But in the short term, the shine has dulled. If you’re wondering, “Is Dogecoin still the best new meme coin to buy in December 2024?” the answer might hinge on whether it can regain its bullish momentum. For now, though, BTFD is stealing the spotlight. Turbo: Community Power Meets Growing Pains Turbo (TURBO) takes a unique spin on meme coins by putting the community in the driver’s seat. As a decentralised and community-owned project, Turbo embodies the growing shift towards user-led innovation. But this approach isn’t without its challenges. While Turbo’s vision is bold, the lack of a fully developed infrastructure and roadmap leaves room for uncertainty. Currently, Turbo’s performance has been underwhelming compared to its peers. While its community focus is a major strength, the project’s limited progress has some investors treading cautiously. In a market driven by hype and deliverables, Turbo’s slow pace could hold it back from becoming the best new meme coin to buy in December 2024. That said, Turbo’s potential shouldn’t be dismissed. If the community can rally and push for meaningful developments, Turbo could establish itself as a formidable player in the meme coin space. For now, though, it feels like the underdog in a race dominated by heavy hitters like BTFD. Which Meme Coin Deserves Your Dollars? When it comes to meme coins, the choices are as diverse as they are exciting. Dogecoin has history and a massive fanbase, but its recent struggles have dimmed its appeal. Turbo’s decentralised ethos is commendable, but its lack of momentum raises questions. Then there’s BTFD Coin , the undeniable breakout star of December 2024. With its explosive presale, innovative P2E game, and sky-high growth potential, BTFD is the clear winner. If you’re looking for the best new meme coin to buy in December 2024, it’s time to stop wondering and start acting. Don’t miss your chance to get in early.

Among these contenders, DTX Exchange (DTX), Injective (INJ), and Sui Blockchain (SUI) are vying for attention. Each project has its unique strengths, but DTX Exchange stands out as a hybrid trading platform poised to redefine the trading experience. But should investors view DTX Exchange as the top investment choice for December, ahead of Sui and INJ? Let’s find out. Injective (INJ) Soars 23%: AI-Powered “iAgent” Fuels Token Surge Injective (INJ) has recently introduced a new software kit that allows anyone to create their own AI agents on the blockchain. This tool, called iAgent, aims to make using blockchain easier by adding AI to assist users, regardless of their skill level. The iAgent will simplify interactions by providing AI-driven tips and guidance. The announcement has caught the attention of investors, resulting in a notable 23% upsurge in Injective’s token, INJ, over the past week. Looking ahead, interest in the token is expected to remain strong due to the excitement around AI and the new software kit. Consequently, experts believe INJ may continue to see growth over the next month. Sui Blockchain Back Online: Will SUI Price Bounce Back From the Dip? Sui Blockchain had a major issue last week when it stopped generating new blocks for about two and a half hours. The problem was caused by an update intended to improve the network’s functionality. A flaw in this update created issues, but the development team acted quickly, releasing fixes to resolve the problem. Currently, SUI is trading around $3.23, reflecting an 11% decline over the past week, likely influenced by the recent network issues. However, it has risen 95% in the last month and 460% since November 2023. With a daily trading volume of $2.41 billion, Sui Blockchain remains popular among investors. The development team’s prompt response seems to have reassured many, and this is expected to maintain strong buying interest in the token and also increase its price. DTX Presale: Secure Your Tokens at $0.10 Before the 100x Surge While Injective and Sui Blockchain may have their merits, DTX Exchange is poised to outshine both this December and beyond. What truly sets DTX Exchange apart is its innovative hybrid approach. This model addresses critical issues affecting the trading industry, including limited access, high fees, and a lack of diverse asset classes. Moreover, DTX Exchange is committed to promoting financial inclusion. By allowing users to trade directly from their crypto wallets without requiring traditional bank accounts, the platform empowers individuals with limited access to formal banking systems. This approach is significant, as it opens the door for countless users to participate in the global financial markets, thus democratizing access to trading. As a presale coin, DTX tokens are currently undervalued, especially when compared to other top altcoins.Priced at just $0.10 in the fifth round of the public presale, the token is projected to experience a 100x increase post-listing on Tier-1 exchanges. With nearly $9 million raised in early funding and pre-listing on CoinMarketCap, DTX is undoubtedly one of the new altcoins to watch this December.

Russia’s Federation Council has recently approved a tax bill that could reshape the digital asset landscape for traders. The bill has already passed the State Duma and is awaiting President Vladimir Putin’s signature. This legislative shift comes amid significant economic turbulence for Russia. The country’s official currency, ruble, is in freefall, while Bitcoin is hitting record highs. Tax Imposition on Crypto Transactions in Russia Russia is rapidly moving to regulate its crypto sector, recently unveiling a comprehensive tax framework that classifies digital currencies as property. The new framework targets individual traders while offering exemptions for authorized mining operations. Under the new legislation, cryptocurrency transactions will be subject to a graduated tax system. Individuals earning up to 2.4 million rubles annually, around $21,210 from crypto activities, will be taxed at 13%. While earnings exceeding this amount will be taxed at a higher rate of 15%. This tax scheme is designed to create a clear system for crypto traders, addressing years of regulatory ambiguity surrounding digital assets in Russia. This is a crucial step toward formalizing the sector. It ensures that individuals and businesses involved in cryptocurrency pay their fair share of taxes. Russia Monitors Crypto Mining and Applies New Restrictions While crypto traders face new tax obligations, the bill relieves miners. Mining operators will be exempt from value-added tax (VAT) on mined coins. This provides a significant incentive for businesses in the mining industry. The exemption applies to coins mined via authorized platforms, creating a clear distinction between regulated and unregulated mining activities. Russia is tightening control over crypto mining by limiting unregistered operations to 6,000 kilowatt-hours of energy per month. Starting December 1, due to electricity shortages, regional mining bans will be imposed until March 2025. Additionally, mining companies must provide detailed reports about their operations to the Russian tax authorities. Non-compliance with these reporting requirements could lead to fines of up to 40,000 rubles (around $360). Bitcoin Hits New Heights as Ruble Sinks, Driving Record Exchange Traffic This legislative overhaul comes at a crucial time for both Bitcoin and the ruble. On November 27, Bitcoin hit an all-time high of 11 million rubles per coin. This surge was fueled by a global rally and the ruble’s 25% drop against the U.S. dollar over the past year. The Bitcoin price surge has directly impacted Russia’s crypto exchange activity. The bearish outlook of the ruble has caused traders and investors to turn to crypto investment. According to MegaFon, global internet traffic to major exchanges has increased by 8% Russian users account for 27-30% of total traffic on major platforms. Crypto exchanges like Deribit saw a 126% traffic increase, and platforms like HTX and KuCoin recorded increases of 24% and 23%, respectively.

On-chain data showed that Wilcke sent 20,000 Ether ( ETH ) to the California-located centralized crypto exchange Kraken. The motivation for Wilcke’s move was unknown, but an exchange deposit usually signals a plan to sell. Community members highlighted that Wilcke’s past transactions have sometimes preceded price declines in Ethereum. For instance, on Jan. 6, 2021, Ethereum’s price fell after Wilcke deposited 15,000 ETH. Similarly, on Feb. 11 and Feb. 14, 2024, his movements of 4,300 ETH and 10,000 ETH, respectively, were followed by price drops.

However, traders who have noticed ETH pump are taking advantage through investing in its ecosystem meme coins. Provided ETH continues amassing value, we can expect liquidity to rotate into the ecosystem, and the high volatility of meme coins makes them an attractive asset class in bullish periods. Over the past 24 hours, Ethereum ecosystem tokens like Ethereum Name Service, Ethena, Uniswap, and Aave have all booked significant gains. Yet, as is often the case, the lion’s share of trading volume doesn’t come from any of those tokens but from meme coins. Pepe has processed over $3 billion in 24-hour volume – that’s more than Ethena, Uniswap, and Aave combined. CatSlap Prepares For a 418% Rally New Ethereum meme coin CatSlap has jumped approximately 20% from its recent support zone and is now approaching a rally which has a price target of $0.012 – a 418% increase from its current price. The project is a new cat-themed meme coin on the Ethereum blockchain, and it’s rumored to have been launched by the team behind Dogwifhat. There’s no confirmation on that, but the team has serious skills and market understanding. They haven’t just launched a meme coin – CatSlap also offers a gamified experience called CatSlap Slapometer and a staking mechanism that provides a 40% APY. The cat coin meta is underrepresented in crypto, with a market cap of $5.3 billion. In comparison, the dog coin market is worth $90 billion. There’s no doubt CatSlap hopes to claw some big gains and close the gap. And with a $19 million market cap, there’s plenty of upside on the table. Investors can buy CatSlap using the DEX widget on its website or using the Best Wallet app via the Upcoming Tokens feature. Pepe Leads Large Cap Memes Pepe is stealing the show today as the front-running large-cap meme coin, pulling a 7.9% gain today. It’s followed by fellow Ethereum-based meme coin Mog Coin, which is up 5.5%. As mentioned, Pepe is also seeing huge trading volume today, which often indicates more price gains to follow.

A New Home For Meme Coins On Ethereum CatSlap and Pepe are showing strong demand, but soon – most meme coins won’t launch directly on the Ethereum main network – they’ll launch on a new Ethereum layer 2 called Pepe Unchained . Pepe Unchained is set to launch in two weeks once its token presale commences, and it’s going to cut costs and make transactions 100x faster than on the Ethereum main network. The Pepe Chain will be accessible with an Ethereum wallet, so users can easily transfer money over and get started trading meme coins. It’s also going to have Pepe Pump Pad, a meme coin generator that lets users create a meme coin in just two clicks. This is expected to bolster ecosystem activity and solidify Pepe Unchained as Ethereum’s memetic hotbed. The Pepe Unchained presale is ongoing, so investors can join now to take advantage. The presale has raised $52 million, which is almost 3x what Ethereum raised in its 2014 ICO.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | ENS,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/ethereum-meme-coin-watch-catslap-20-pepe-7-as-eth-outperforms-bitcoin/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

36963192,https://cryptonews.com/?p=313785,1732811326,"USDT is Sold Cheaper in Mexico Due to Its Links to Drug Cartels, US Feds Claim","A recent investigation has allegedly revealed that global drug trade operations commonly utilize Tether (USDT) . The coin is priced much cheaper in some countries, opening an avenue to buy money for a lower price. According to 404 Media, citing two court documents ( one , two ), Mexican and Colombian drug cartels, including the notorious Sinaloa cartel, have increasingly relied on cryptocurrencies, especially USDT, to facilitate their illicit operations. According to a confidential source, USDT is available in Mexico at a discounted rate due to its links to drug proceeds. The source explained that Mexican-based groups often sell USDT at a lower price than its market value, knowing its association with criminal activity taints it. These same USDT tokens are then sold at higher prices in countries like Colombia. There, groups and individuals trade the coins through various methods, including currency exchanges, peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions, and over-the-counter (OTC) trades. Therefore, the discounted price in Mexico is a reflection of the stablecoin’s illicit origins. Overall, this phenomenon has become a well-known practice among drug traffickers in the region. Source: a document screenshot, 404 Media The documents detailed how a money laundering network allegedly connected to major drug seizures in the US has been moving vast sums of money—potentially tens of millions of dollars—across borders. They do this through a combination of front businesses, cash drop-offs, and extensive cryptocurrency transfers. Court documents highlight how drug traffickers, looking for a more efficient way to transfer wealth, have adopted cryptocurrency to sidestep traditional financial systems. This makes cross-border transactions quicker and harder to trace. Therefore, USDT has become a popular vehicle for laundering money across borders, the US Federal authorities argued. The stablecoin allows massive sums of money to move swiftly across countries without relying on conventional banks or financial institutions. True Scale Unknown One document filed recently as part of a civil forfeiture case seeks to seize over $5 million worth of Tether stored in cryptocurrency accounts allegedly linked to drug trafficking. The documents further reveal that, between May 2020 and September 2023, one Binance account involved in these activities processed over $15.6 million in cryptocurrency, with more than 450 deposits and nearly 570 withdrawals. Source: a document screenshot, 404 Media This suggests that the true scale of cryptocurrency use in drug trafficking is far larger than these seized funds. In a separate but related investigation, the FBI has uncovered another money laundering network that used crypto brokers to move funds for the Sinaloa cartel and other Mexican drug cartels. The authorities find that this organization has laundered more than $52 million in drug proceeds before 2021. Not Bought From Tether Directly, Says Spokesperson The involvement of USDT in these illicit transactions is not a surprise to Tether. A Tether spokesperson addressed the issue in a statement to 404 Media, noting that transactions related to criminal activities typically occur on the secondary market. This means they are not directly sourced from Tether’s authorized channels. Additionally, the company asserts, it has implemented blockchain tracking tools and collaborated with over 195 law enforcement agencies worldwide to identify and stop illicit transactions. Tether’s cooperation with authorities has led to the freezing of over $2 billion in USDT linked to criminal enterprises, it claims. The company seeks to distance itself from associations with illegal activities. Therefore, it works to assist in the prosecution of drug traffickers, an effort that has become a part of its public image. Blockchain-based companies have generally worked to implement tracking and anti-money laundering measures. Nonetheless, some experts argue that the industry’s decentralized and anonymous nature still poses a significant challenge to authorities.

Pink Shiba Inu (PINKSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PINKSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pink Shiba Inu can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pink Shiba Inu could become the next viral memecoin. Pink Shiba Inu launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pink Shiba Inu on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pink Shiba Inu by entering its contract address – 6cPu1KvERtjkPK8RuiwpjpTZ4kYfY5KzrG48d5wyD2XX – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PINKSHIB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/pink-shiba-inu-pinkshib-will-explode-over-19000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Data from DeFiLlama shows that Shibarium’s DeFi TVL has soared to $3.76 million, marking its highest level in 30 days. This metric has surged by 20% in the last five days, underscoring the rising usage of the protocols created on the network. In the last week, the top five largest decentralized exchanges (DEXs) created on Shibarium have seen their TVL surge by double-digit percentages. The rising TVL could spell gains for Shiba Inu (SHIB) due to the token’s rising utility. Going by past trends, SHIB tends to gain whenever Shibarium records growth in its TVL. For instance, in late September, after Shibarium’s TVL surged nearly threefold within days, it fuelled a 33% rally for SHIB. A look at Shiba Inu’s technical indicators suggests that a mega bull run could also be underway, potentially taking SHIB higher. Shiba Inu Forms a Golden Cross Shiba Inu traded at $0.00002515 at press time after a slight 1.4% gain in 24 hours. The meme coin appears to have formed a golden cross on its 4-hour chart. This crossover usually shows that the short-term trend is gaining strength compared to the long-term trend, which paves the way for further price gains. This golden cross could be the fuel that SHIB needs to flip resistance at $0.0000194. SHIB’s uptrend has been rejected at this resistance level several times, and reduced buying volumes have prevented a strong breakout above this level. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows that buying activity is gaining momentum. At the time of writing, it was at 58, which shows that the buying pressure was higher than the selling pressure. If buyers step in due to the bullish sentiment seen in the Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), SHIB will likely rally higher. Shiba Inu’s burn rate soars Another catalyst that could fuel SHIB gains is the burn rate. Data from Shibburn shows that in just 24 hours, more than 38 million SHIB tokens were removed from the circulating supply, a 790% increase from the previous day. SHIB conducts regular token burns, with the burn rate tending to increase whenever network usage is at its peak. Given the rising DeFi activity on the Shibarium network, the burn rate could skyrocket, further boosting SHIB’s gains.",POSITIVE,SHIB,MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/shibarium-tvl-surges-as-shiba-inu-forms-golden-cross-is-a-rocket-move-to-0-001-shib-price-next/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

It is very likely more details will be forthcoming as part of the major announcement, for which there is a countdown prominently displayed on the site. Crypto drawdown held Catslap back, but not for much longer as the Thanksgiving Day rally looms Following the pullback in crypto prices at the beginning of the week and the subsequent recovery, the $SLAP price is well-poised for takeoff. Catslap Token is trading in the $0.002257 region after reaching as high as 0.0034 yesterday (Wednesday 27th). The burn took place on Wednesday at 7:42pm UTC. Volatility in the broader crypto market was led by bitcoin, which traded as low as $90.796 on Tuesday but has since consolidated at $95,000 after trading as high as $97,163. The Thanksgiving holiday means financial markets are closed in the US, but crypto never sleeps, which could see an influx of trading activity running into Black Friday. A renewed push to the $100k level for bitcoin would ignite the smoldering embers of the altcoin season, which yesterday saw the outperformance of top altcoins such as ETH and XRP against bitcoin. Low-cap meme coins like Catslap could be major beneficiaries of what could be an enormous holiday rally. What has Catslap got up its sleeve for its ‘major announcement’? The ‘major announcement’ by the Catslap team is only seven days away. Given the burn event that has just taken place and the new Slap-to-Earn features hinted at in the X post earlier this week, it begs the question – what will be communicated in the announcement? Anticipation is bolstering FOMO around Catslap as buyers flood in ahead of the big news. Catslap has caught the attention of analysts and influencers across the crypto world. For instance, YouTuber Oscar Ramos has done an in-depth and honest review of Catslap for his 102k subscribers. He trumpets the instant viral appeal of the Slapometer, where he is impressed by being able to start clicking-to-slap straight from the homepage, with sound effects included. Oscar says Catslap has the potential to be the next big cat meme coin. Meanwhile, on X, @degenlife has been letting his 100k followers know that this is “the launch that everyone’s talking about”: Degens!

If you missed out on the 600x gains Popcat investors enjoyed, then Catslap could be your chance for outsized ROI. $1000 of $SLAP tokens bought today may be valued at $600,000 in the not-too-distant future. Popcat is down 16.3% in the past seven days, contrasting with Catslap , which is up 1,899% over the same period, notwithstanding the recent pullback. An expected $SLAP price breakout at $0.0032 was blown off course by the bitcoin reversal on Tuesday. Since then, a period of consolidation has followed, with Thanksgiving Day now upon us. The X post to the 9,855 followers on X went out at around 10:30am UTC today. As the news spreads of the burn, the market is likely to respond positively. Strong pricing support below the current levels will also encourage new entrants who don’t want to miss out on more burns, the expected P2E developments and any other news that could be announced in seven days’ time. Bulls are anticipating a price surge above $0.0060, as $SLAP retests its all-time high at 0.$0069. Here’s how to buy and stake $SLAP to earn 40% a year rewards in a token going to the moon You can buy $SLAP on a new fast-growing crypto wallet Best Wallet . It has been downloaded more than 100,000 times and has an exclusive deal with Catslap allowing purchases to buy and stake the token at the click of a button.

Alternatively for those who do not wish to stake, $SLAP can be bought on DEXs using trading tools such as Uniswap. $SLAP runs on the Ethereum chain, so beware of scam imitations on Solana or elsewhere.

Top Altcoins Dominate the News Cycle,"Altcoins are surging and dominating headlines, with Dogecoin (DOGE) surpassing luxury automaker Porsche by market cap amid news of a DOGE ETP launch. Top altcoins such as Cardano (ADA), Ripple (XRP), Stellar (XLM), and Ether (ETH) continue to gain impressively, signalling the imminent arrival of the altcoin season. Altcoins have dominated headlines in recent days with continued gains. Ethereum (ETH) surged over 7% in the past week and comfortably trades above $3,500. Large-cap altcoins, including Ripple (XRP), Cardano (ADA), and Stellar (XLM), also enjoy a week of double-digit gains. Join us as we explore the top gainers and potential winners as the altcoin season inches closer. Dogecoin (DOGE) Memecoin OG Dogecoin (DOGE) has dominated headlines since Donald Trump’s recent victory over Kamala Harris in the US presidential election. Over the past 30 days, DOGE surged a whopping 194% and is now the 7th largest crypto with a market cap nearing $60 billion. After starting its journey in the industry as a joke, DOGE quickly became a household name, transitioning into one of the most profitable investment opportunities. Dogecoin (DOGE) surged in popularity and value after Donald Trump’s election victory and the president-elect’s announcement of the Department of Government Efficiency, nicknamed DOGE. According to Trump, DOGE will pave the way for his administration to “dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditure, and restructure Federal Agencies – Essential to the “Save America” Movement.” Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy will co-lead the newly created department. DOGE is expected to surge after DeFi Technologies introduced Valour Dogecoin (DOGE) ETP on Sweden’s Spotlight Stock Market. The ETP will allow retail and institutional investors to gain exposure to DOGE without directly owning the asset. Amid Dogecoin’s increasing popularity and momentum, the token managed to flip luxury car maker Porsche’s market cap. With a market cap exceeding $58 billion , Dogecoin surpassed Porsche’s $56.1 billion market capitalization. Cardano (ADA) Gains 25% Cardano (ADA) is another major gainer since Donald Trump’s election victory. On-chain metrics show Cardano’s weekly active addresses elevated since the crypto market rally triggered by Trump’s win on November 6 began. The surge in network usage and whale buying activity has resulted in a bullish outlook for ADA. ADA further surged after the Cardano blockchain developers, the Cardano Foundation, released an updated proposal for the Cardano Constitution to improve network governance. The revised proposal includes changes to constitutional workshops, social media discussion, and expert and community feedback. The changes aim to “improve the accessibility and clarity of the Cardano governance framework,” shifting its focus to a less technical audience. Interest in Cardano (ADA) surged after its founder, Charles Hoskinson, revealed plans to help shape US crypto policy under Donald Trump’s incoming administration. Cardano’s gained over 25% in the past week, currently trading at $1.00. Cross-Border Payment Network Ripple (XRP) Continue As a Top Gainer Ripple (XRP) has witnessed a spectacular gain in value after news of Gary Gensler’s planned exit surfaced. Ripple Labs has been embroiled in a highly publicized legal battle with the securities agency for which Ripple paid a hefty price. In 2020, the regulator sued Ripple for its supposed breach of securities laws, resulting in many exchanges, such as Coinbase, Kraken, Bitstamp, and Gemini, choosing to delist XRP. Ripple finally found some relief after a partial victory in 2023 ended the SEC’s 3-year-long crusade against the company. The Southern District of New York Court delivered a partial victory to Ripple in its matter with the SEC after Judge Analisa Torres ruled that Ripple’s XRP token is “not necessarily a security on its face.” XRP’s price gained over 29% in the past week with a bullish outlook. Ripple received some further bullish news after Chris Giancarlo, former chair of the CFTC, predicted the SEC would drop its case against the company.

How Will It Affect the Price? Top Analysts Evaluate!,"The rally in Bitcoin has not been fully experienced in Ethereum and altcoins, and investors are eagerly awaiting the rise for ETH. At this point, analysts are optimistic about the future of Ethereum, while saying that Bitcoin remaining in a range below $ 100,000 is a positive development for the ETH price and could attract more investments. K33 Research research head Vetle Lunde shared on his X account that there has been an increase in demand for leveraged trading products from Ethereum investors. Vetle Lunde noted that since November 5, exposure in the VolatilityShares 2x leveraged long ETH ETF has increased by 278,150 ETH, representing a 160% increase and holding more than half of CME’s ETH open interest. Ethereum (ETH) Price Could Rise Above $4,000! While this situation is interpreted as a sign of a potential rise in the ETH price, Bitget Research chief analyst Ryan Lee said that the recent rise above $3,600 was due to spot accumulation rather than speculation. Lee said that this upward trend, along with the recovering ETH/BTC exchange rate, shows that Ethereum is ready for more upward momentum in the coming weeks. Popular investor Wolf also stated that he expects an increase in Ethereum and said that technical chart formations could cause the ETH price to rise above the psychological level of $ 4,000. Bitcoin Consolidation Could Be a Good Catalyst for Ethereum! Finally, popular analyst Rekt Capital said that Bitcoin staying below $100,000 and consolidating in the meantime could be a positive catalyst for the Ethereum price: “Bitcoin trading in the $91,000 to $100,000 range could be a catalyst for Ethereum to pull ahead and provide money to smaller altcoins.” *This is not investment advice.

ARKB offers one of the lowest expense ratios at 0.21%, making it cost-effective for investors. However, it has a higher bid/ask spread (0.05% vs. IBIT’s 0.02%). While both ETFs saw significant inflows during the Bitcoin bull run, IBIT’s AUM growth outpaced ARKB, in my view due to BlackRock’s strong Bitcoin advocacy and market dominance. ARKB diversifies its custodians, unlike most ETFs that rely solely on Coinbase. While this reduces risk, custodian reliance remains a critical concern for Bitcoin ETF investors. ARKB is an excellent choice for long-term Bitcoin exposure, but IBIT’s superior liquidity and narrower spreads make it the better overall option in this comparison, in my opinion. With what seems a Bitcoin bull run underway, many readers may wonder which ETF is best for gaining exposure to this asset class. To address this need, I’m collaborating with Seeking Alpha’s editors and their outreach program to write a short series evaluating Bitcoin ETFs. Bitcoin ETFs offer retail investors a simple, tax-efficient way to invest in Bitcoin through their brokerage accounts. In this “showdown” series, I’ll compare various Bitcoin ETFs against the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ), the largest and most liquid option on the market. If another ETF outperforms IBIT in these comparisons, I’ll reconsider my reference choice. Note that this series does not address whether now is the right time to invest in Bitcoin. I still view Bitcoin as a high-risk, asymmetric bet on its potential to mature into a global reserve asset. Investors uncertain about Bitcoin should first research its fundamentals and assess whether it aligns with their risk profile and objectives. For those interested, I recently shared my valuation model for Bitcoin and explained why I see it maturing into a global reserve asset rather than a global currency. ARKB ETF profile I am starting this series by analyzing the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF ( ARKB ). All information about this fund is available in the ETF’s fact sheet and on the issuer’s dedicated webpage . ARK Invest, the issuer of the ARKB ETF, defines its fund as a way to “access to one of the leading digital assets without mastering arcane details of how to safely trade or store them”. While the use of “arcane” might seem a bit excessive, I agree that for most retail investors exposure to Bitcoin via an ETF is an overall better choice than having to set up their own wallets or relying on loosely regulated intermediaries. The ETF seeks to track the performance of Bitcoin, and more precisely that of the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate – New York Variant. This index produces a once a day price for Bitcoin aggregating multiple trade data from different cryptocurrency exchanges. Using an index for the price of Bitcoin is a common practice among Bitcoin ETFs. Bitcoin prices expressed in USD can vary significantly between exchanges and sometimes even from country to country (see the “ Kimchi premium ”, referring to how Bitcoin tends to be more expensive in South Korea than in other markets). Because of this, it is important that Bitcoin funds use a clear and universal index, rather than relying on what their custodians might quote. BlackRock uses the same index as ARKB in its IBIT ETF. The ARKB Bitcoin ETF, like all Bitcoin and crypto ETFs, relies on custodians to manage its holdings. This means the Bitcoin purchased by the ETF is held by a separate custodian institution that operates as a distinct legal entity from the issuer. ARKB’s fact sheet exclusively mentions Coinbase, Inc. ( COIN ) as a custodian for this fund. However, several online sources mention that Anchorage Digital Bank has joined Coinbase as a custodian for ARKB in September of this year. I view this as a positive development, showing that the fund issuer is actively working to diversify custodians to reduce the risk connected to Bitcoin storage. ARK Invest appears to take custodian risks seriously, as highlighted in the following disclaimer for potential investors: Failure by the Trusts Bitcoin Custodian to exercise due care in the safekeeping of the Trusts bitcoin could result in a loss to the Trust. Shareholders cannot be assured that the Bitcoin Custodian will maintain adequate insurance with respect to the Bitcoin held by the custodian on behalf of the Trust. I agree with ARK’s caution and consider the reliance on custodians to be the main risk of investing in Bitcoin through an ETF. Most Bitcoin ETFs use Coinbase as a custodian. While Coinbase is a reputable company and a strong choice, it still represents a single point of failure—a risk I will discuss in detail in the risk section later in this article. Key metrics at a glance The ARKB ETF has the following key metrics at the time of writing: Expense ratio of 0.21%, with no discount on fees for the first months of holding period, unlike other ETFs, including IBIT. Asset Under Management ((AUM)) of $4.74 Billion. Average Bid/Ask Spread of 0.05%. Average Daily Trading Volume of $103 Million. I believe these metrics are competitive within the Bitcoin ETF landscape. ARKB stands out with one of the lowest expense ratios at 0.21%, with only two other major Bitcoin ETFs offering lower fees. However, where ARKB falls short compared to IBIT, the market leader by AUM, is its higher spread—a result of its lower liquidity. I will go into details on this aspect in the next section. ARKB vs. IBIT ARKB vs. IBIT KPIs at a glance (Author's elaboration of Seeking Alpha and ETF.com data) The table above compares key metrics for ARKB and IBIT ETFs, with 'P3M' representing changes over the past three months (August to November 2024). What stands out to me is the growth in AUM for both funds, reflecting significant inflows into Bitcoin during the last three months. IBIT’s AUM growth nearly doubled that of ARKB in this period, something I attribute to BlackRock’s strong advocacy for Bitcoin as a nascent asset class, positioning Blackrock itself as the most vocal mainstream institution supporting Bitcoin. Despite IBIT’s growth in AUM, ARKB also saw significant inflows in its ETFs - something, I believe, is due to the overall Bitcoin bull run and growth of Bitcoin as an asset class. In contrast, ARKB’s Average Daily Trading Volume ((ADTV)) has declined over the past three months. This in my view suggests investors are using ARKB primarily for long-term holding rather than frequent trading. This makes particularly sense by looking at the difference in Bid / Ask Spread between the two ETFs. The key difference between ARKB and IBIT lies indeed in their respective Average Bid/Ask Spread, with ARKB at 0.05%, significantly higher than IBIT’s 0.02%. Notably, IBIT’s spread decreased from 0.03% to 0.02% over the past three months—a reflection, in my view, of its increased liquidity driven by higher AUM and ADTV. In summary, IBIT is by far the most liquid of the two ETFs. In terms of expense ratio, the two ETFs are very close to each other, charging 0.21% and 0.25% respectively. In my view there is no significant difference between the two ETFs, when accounting for ARKB's higher Spread, more than compensating for its lower fees. The two ETFs also have options available to trade, starting this month of November 2024. Conclusion: Who is this ETF for? To conclude the “showdown” of ARKB vs. IBIT, I have compiled the following table where I assign a qualitative score, reflecting all the considerations that I discussed in this article. ARKB vs. IBIT Qualitative Comparison (Author's work) Overall, I view ARKB as an excellent product, particularly suited for investors seeking long-term Bitcoin exposure . However, the key area where ARKB falls short—and why I believe IBIT comes out ahead—is liquidity. ARKB’s significantly higher Average Spread outweighs, in my opinion, its lower expense ratio of 0.21% compared to IBIT’s 0.25%. As such, I believe IBIT is the superior ETFs between the two funds - by a short margin . Risks to investing in Bitcoin ETFs and ARKB Investing in Bitcoin remains, in my view, a highly speculative bet on the possibility this asset matures into a global reserve asset. I do personally like this bet, and this article did not discuss the investment thesis for Bitcoin. However, this remains the main risk that any investor considering ARKB (or any other Bitcoin ETF) should carefully consider in my opinion. Another significant risk of investing in Bitcoin ETFs is custodian risk. ETF issuers rely on custodians like Coinbase to manage their Bitcoin holdings. Should the custodian face fraudulent activity or a security breach, investors could lose part or all of their investment. The reliance on Coinbase by the majority of Bitcoin ETFs compounds this risk, in my view. While ARKB appears to diversify by using multiple custodians, this risk remains an important factor to consider.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4740985-bitcoin-etfs-showdown-ibit-edges-out-arkb?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/36960387.jpeg

The sustainability of this newfound momentum is of key interest to the general cryptocurrency market, as it is viewed as a precursor to the start of an altcoin season heading into 2025. Notably, as of press time, Ethereum was trading at $3,569, having rallied by over 1% in the last 24 hours. On the weekly chart, ETH is up almost 8%. ETH one-day price chart. Source: CoinMarketCap As reported by Finbold, following the recent momentum, several analysts have offered a mixed outlook for the asset. For instance, after temporarily breaching the $3,600 resistance, prominent on-chain cryptocurrency analyst Ali Martinez set a short-term target of $6,000 for ETH. This move would likely add more credence to the altcoin season. Ethereum Rainbow Chart insights To confirm the possibility of an altcoin rally, Ethereum will need to build on its current gains throughout 2024 and into the new year. In this regard, the Ethereum Rainbow Chart, a popular tool among investors and traders, offers insights on what to expect on the first day of 2025. The chart visually maps ETH’s historical price data on a logarithmic scale, with color-coded bands representing different price zones, from “Fire Sale” at the low end to “Maximum Bubble Territory” at the high end. These representations are meant to help investors assess Ethereum’s current price in relation to its historical performance and suggest potential future price targets. The chart placed Ethereum in the “Steady” zone at press time, ranging between $2,854 and $4,123. This suggests that the DeFi asset’s price is in a phase of steady performance without significant upward or downward pressure at the moment. Ethereum Rainbow Chart. Source: Blockchain Center ETH price prediction for January 1, 2025 Regarding the future price of the second-ranked cryptocurrency by market cap, the Rainbow Chart projects that Ethereum could trade between $761.55 and $18,254.39 on the first day of 2025. Ethereum Rainbow Chart. Source: Blockchain Center At the top, “Maximum Bubble Territory” places Ethereum between $12,783.90 and $18,254.39, signaling extreme overvaluation and a potential market bubble. Below the “Maximum Bubble Territory,” the “But have we earned it?” zone from $8,925.12 to $12,783.90 points to slight overvaluation, with prices potentially exceeding fundamental growth. The “Is this the Flipping?” zone, spanning $6,121.27 to $8,925.12, marks a milestone at which Ethereum may surpass past highs without excessive inflation. Additionally, the market will appear healthy and attractive to long-term holders in the “HODL!” zone, which predicts ETH will trade between $4,207.87 and $6,121.32 on January 1st. The “Steady” zone, ranging from $2,913.73 to $4,207.87, reflects stability and potential moderate growth. Below this, the “Still Cheap” zone, $2,037.75 to $2,913.73, signals undervaluation and a buying opportunity. The “Accumulate” zone ($1,441.41–$2,037.75) signals significant undervaluation, while the “Undervalued” zone ($1,037.07–$1,441.51) offers a strong entry point for long-term investors. Currently, in the “Steady” zone, Ethereum needs to breach the $4,000 resistance to advance toward the higher bands of the chart. Finally, the “Fire Sale” zone ($761.55–$1,037.07) represents deep undervaluation with high-risk, high-reward potential as of January 1, 2025.

36959988,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=655367,1732809620,Bitcoin Holds Above $90K – On-Chain Data Reveals Key Demand Levels,"Bitcoin recently saw a 9% retrace from its all-time high of $99,800, narrowly missing the psychological $100K milestone. The pullback brought BTC down to a low of $90,700 on Tuesday, sparking concern among some investors. However, the price has since recovered, showing resilience as it climbs back toward key resistance levels. Despite the volatility, Bitcoin’s long-term bullish structure remains intact, with market sentiment leaning optimistic. Top analyst Axel Adler has provided key on-chain insights that suggest that the strong demand for Bitcoin persists at current levels. According to Adler, this buying activity indicates that investors view pullbacks as opportunities to accumulate, underscoring confidence in Bitcoin’s potential for further growth. However, he also highlighted solid support at lower price levels, which could come into play if the current recovery fails to sustain. The next few days will be crucial as Bitcoin tests its ability to reclaim momentum and potentially break through the $100K barrier. With demand remaining robust and market conditions aligning for a potential breakout, all eyes are on whether BTC can sustain its upward trajectory or if further consolidation is on the horizon. The stage is set for a decisive move in Bitcoin’s price action. Bitcoin Data Reveals Investors’ Entry Prices Bitcoin continues to showcase extremely bullish price action, driven by increasing demand from institutional and retail investors. Key on-chain data from CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler highlights critical price dynamics shaping the current market . According to Adler, Bitcoin’s price is presently consolidating within the average purchase range of two key investor cohorts: the 1D ($96.8K) and the 1D-1W ($95.3K). These levels act as crucial support zones, reflecting strong buyer interest at current prices. Additionally, the average purchase level in the 1W-1M range, positioned at $84K, provides an extra layer of support in case of a broader market pullback. This indicates that even in a more bearish scenario, Bitcoin will likely find stability around $84K before resuming its upward trajectory. The data reinforces a widely held bullish outlook for Bitcoin among analysts and investors, many of whom believe the current cycle is still in its early stages. The strong demand and robust support levels suggest that Bitcoin is well-positioned to maintain its bullish momentum in the weeks ahead. Whether BTC holds above its current levels or experiences a temporary dip, the consensus remains optimistic about further gains, with this cycle potentially marking a historic run for the cryptocurrency. BTC Nears $100K Bitcoin is currently trading at $95,200, a pivotal level that could determine its next major move. This price point serves as a crucial threshold, and if Bitcoin holds above it, the stage would be set for a potential test of the highly anticipated $100,000 level. Before reaching this psychological milestone, the next significant supply zone lies at $98,800. A break above this level would likely trigger a massive breakout, propelling BTC beyond its all-time high and into six-figure territory for the first time. However, the stakes remain high. Bitcoin could face a deeper correction if it fails to maintain its position above the $90,000 level. In such a scenario, the next strong support is at $85,500, a critical level that would need to hold to preserve Bitcoin’s bullish structure. Market participants closely monitor these key levels, as Bitcoin’s trajectory will influence broader market sentiment. With strong demand and momentum, the coming days will be pivotal in determining whether BTC surges past $100,000 or consolidates further before resuming its bullish run. As the market remains highly dynamic, traders and investors are bracing for significant moves ahead.

It enables value and data to be shared between networks like Ethereum and Bitcoin without intermediaries. Using parachains, Polkadot enhances speed and scalability, processing transactions more efficiently than Bitcoin and Ethereum. The DOT token is used for governance and staking within the network. Currently, with a market cap of $12.45B, Polkadot sits at the 15th spot in ranking by market cap. DOT is priced at $8.18 after showcasing a 44.2% jump in the past week. Solana’s scalable blockchain platform offers flexibility Solana is a blockchain platform focused on scalability, providing a foundation for decentralized applications similar to Ethereum and Cardano. It is designed for faster transactions and offers flexible development options across multiple programming languages. The SOL coin, Solana’s native cryptocurrency, is central to its ecosystem. SOL’s ascent over the past year has been nothing short of extraordinary. The crypto even managed to cross its previous all-time high earlier this month. Currently, sitting at $235.69, SOL has dipped 2.4% in the past week but has managed to gain 0.45% in the past 24 hours. Conclusion While established coins like DOT and SOL offer stability, they currently show less potential for short-term growth. In contrast, CYBRO emerges as a technologically advanced DeFi platform providing investors with unique opportunities to maximize earnings through AI-powered yield aggregation on the Blast blockchain. With features such as lucrative staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, and cashback on purchases, CYBRO ensures a superior user experience with seamless deposits and withdrawals.

36960506,https://blockworks.co/news/solana-ecosystem-2024-milestones,1732809600,The Solana ecosystem has a lot to be thankful for this year,"This is a segment from the Lightspeed newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . Here’s a look back at all of the innovations, milestones, and wins that made Solana’s 2024 unforgettable. Grab a glass of your favorite holiday cheer, and let’s raise a toast to another year of SOLid progress. Resilient market performance Talk about the comeback! SOL didn’t just bounce back in 2024 — it took flight from the ashes, soaring from around $40 a year ago to an all-time high of over $260 in recent days. Critics who doubted the network’s reliability? Silenced. Solana proved its chops, clocking near-perfect uptime and showing the world it can scale without breaking a sweat. And boy did the market notice. DEX trading volume on Solana has shot past $100 billion monthly, while futures open interest hit an all-time high of $4.54 billion. Numbers like these don’t lie—this isn’t just a recovery; it’s a victory lap. Developer-driven growth Behind every great blockchain is a legion of builders, and Solana’s community of developers has been crushing it. The Colosseum Radar Hackathon, held from Sept. 2 to Oct. 8, 2024, attracted over 13,600 participants — a 63% increase from its predecessor, Renaissance. On top of that, 2024 saw some serious upgrades to developer tools. Governance tooling from Realms? Check. Rollup-like technology to make the network even more scalable? Double check. With these resources in play, Solana’s developers are building faster and smarter than ever. Ecosystem expansion and adoption The network processed an impressive 62 million daily non-vote transactions in Q3 2024, supported by 1.9 million unique fee payers every single day. Not too bad, right? NFTs have been thriving, too. Platforms like Magic Eden and Tensor led the charge, with Solana’s total NFT sales volume surpassing $5 billion early this year. And let’s not forget stablecoins. A 151% year-over-year market cap increase brought Solana’s stablecoin total to $3.8 billion. With Circle doubling down on USDC support, Solana is staking its claim as DeFi’s main stage. Community spirit and decentralization But you know what really sets Solana apart? The people — and this year, the network has demonstrated how a vibrant community can be a cornerstone for long-term success. Solana Breakpoint heralded a slew of new initiatives on the network. IRL hubs like The Shipyard in Bangalore and The Port in Miami became go-to spots for innovation, collaboration, and maybe the occasional Solana-branded latte. Initiatives aimed at supporting validators have helped maintain a healthy and distributed network. Meanwhile, grassroots campaigns and community-led marketing efforts have amplified Solana’s cultural presence, from engaging memes to viral initiatives that reflect the humor and creativity of the community. If 2024 taught us anything, it’s that a blockchain is only as good as its believers — and Solana’s community is second to none. Sustainability and energy efficiency As of September 2024, the network cut its carbon footprint by a whopping 69%, going from nearly 8,800 tons of CO₂ in 2023 to just 2,671 tons this year, according to data from the Solana Foundation. To put that in perspective, that’s like taking 167 average Americans’ yearly emissions off the map. Solana’s efficiency per transaction? Just 0.00412 watt-hours. Solana is setting a benchmark for the industry, demonstrating how technology can be leveraged to support environmental goals. Innovative use cases and cross-chain growth Interoperability? Solana’s got it in spades. Bridges like Wormhole have made moving assets across blockchains as easy as pie, while tools like Dialect have taken private, wallet-based messaging to the next level. Then there’s Mantis, a shiny new layer-2 solution unveiled at Breakpoint 2024, promising seamless cross-chain transactions and user-centric trading. And Blinks? They’ve changed the game for crypto on social media, integrating functionalities like tipping content creators and minting custom NFTs directly into platforms like X (formerly Twitter). Innovations like these have significantly lowered the barrier to entry for newcomers while providing seamless access for experienced users. Not too shabby. Looking forward 2024 is winding down, but Solana’s momentum shows no signs of slowing. Institutional interest continues to grow, with multiple spot ETFs filed this year, signaling a maturing market and increased confidence in the ecosystem. The focus on decentralized identity, with tools like Solana Mobile Stack (SMS) and advancements in governance systems, lays the groundwork for a more interconnected and user-focused blockchain future. Whether you’re staking SOL, minting NFTs, or just here for the memes , it seems clear that Solana’s brightest days are ahead. From its rock-solid tech to its vibrant community, Solana has given us all plenty to celebrate. Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

36961977,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=103221,1732809452,Ethereum Road to ATH Confirmed as 91% of Holders in Profit,"Recent data shows that an overwhelming majority of Ethereum (ETH) holders are now in profit amid the ongoing major rebound in the price of the ETH token. Ethereum News Now : Analysis platform IntoTheBlock disclosed on X today that up to 90.8% of ETH investors are seeing profit on their investments. This level of profitability has not been seen in the last five months. The latest bullish metric emerged as Ethereum's price rebounded to $3,687 today. ETH last traded at this level in June. Notably, Ethereum reestablished this price range as Bitcoin rallied back to $97,500 after a brief dip to $90,500 earlier this week. While Ethereum initially lagged behind Bitcoin’s uptrend, it is now capitalizing on its momentum to break higher resistance levels.Despite Ethereum trading 26% below its all-time high of $4,890, only 9.2% of investors are holding the asset at a loss. Interestingly, these holders control just 2.8% of Ethereum’s total supply.Ethereum Faces No Significant Bearish Pressure AheadAccording to IntoTheBlock, the current statistics suggest that any selling pressure from this group will likely have a limited impact as ETH continues its uptrend. Ethereum holders in profit/ Image Source: IntoTheBlock Moreover, IntoTheBlock data shows that most Ethereum holders are long-term investors, with 74% holding ETH for over a year. Only 23% bought ETH within the last 12 months, and 3% entered the market in the past month.Essentially, Ethereum is now at a level where it faces minimal resistance and selling pressure, which makes the path open for it to rally toward its all-time high. This situation is further reinforced by data showing that the available reserves of ETH on centralized exchanges have continued to diminish since last year.Ethereum Targets as Bulls Continue to DominateAnalysts such as Ali Martinez have become more confident in their bullish outlook for Ethereum. With Ethereum trading at a five-month high, Martinez has reiterated that the most immediate target for Ethereum is a rally to $6,000. Notably, Ethereum needs to rise by just 66% to reach this all-time high value. Martinez has even set his target at a much higher level for ETH, proposing a more significant 178% surge to $10,000 on a longer-term scale.",POSITIVE,ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/28/ethereum-road-to-ath-confirmed-as-91-of-holders-in-profit/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=ethereum-road-to-ath-confirmed-as-91-of-holders-in-profit,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

The positive shift in netflows syncs with recent market trends, as confirmed by Kaiko Research. While Ethereum’s year-to-date performance lags behind Bitcoin, it briefly outpaced the leading cryptocurrency in November. Ethereum’s price has climbed nearly 40% since late October, bolstering interest in related financial products. Notably, ETH largely consolidated from Nov. 21 to 26, but recently rebounded, ending yesterday with an impressive 10% gain to reclaim the $3,500 region .TradFi Firms Invest in Ethereum ETFsTraditional financial firms are driving this surge. Institutional players, including major hedge funds and investment managers, are increasingly allocating capital to Ethereum ETFs. Firms like BlackRock and Grayscale lead this charge, presenting diverse options for exposure to Ethereum. BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF (ETHA) is particularly notable, attracting massive interest from prominent financial institutions. Notably, data from the recent 13F filings shows that Michigan's state pension fund holds Grayscale’s ETHE shares. Digital Currency Group, the parent of Grayscale, remains the top holder of ETHE. Other major holders include Wealthfront Advisers and Colony Group LLC. Grayscale Ethereum ETF Investors | Kaiko Conversely, BlackRock’s ETHA ETF attracts a different mix of investors. Millennium, a $70 billion hedge fund, is the largest holder of ETHA. Susquehanna International Group and Parkwood LLC also rank among the top investors. BlackRock Ethereum ETF Investors | Kaiko Ethereum ETF Netflows Turn Positive Meanwhile, according to market data from Sosovalue, inflows into Ethereum spot ETFs recently turned positive, signaling increased confidence in the asset class. This comes after a challenging period of outflows, followed by a sharp recovery. Between Nov. 18 and 21, total netflows into Ethereum ETFs experienced significant outflows amounting to $162 million. However, beginning November 22, the trend reversed. Netflows surged by $224.81 million, with $90.10 million in inflows recorded on November 27 alone. Cumulatively, Ethereum ETFs have garnered $240.41 million in inflows, indicating growing institutional interest as Ethereum prices rise. Ethereum ETF Flows Sosovalue Ethereum ETF Flows | Sosovalue The recovery in netflows shows growing adoption of Ethereum ETFs as a vehicle for institutional exposure. As Bitcoin ETFs have gained traction, Ethereum ETFs are beginning to follow suit. While Ethereum futures on platforms like CME still trail Bitcoin in trading volume, increased participation from major financial firms may drive growth. Total trading volumes for Ethereum ETFs have mirrored the recent inflows, as market activity picks up. On Nov. 27, Ethereum ETFs recorded $881.61 million in total trading value, the highest in recent weeks. Total net assets now stand at $10.80 billion, confirming the expanding market share of the asset class.",POSITIVE,ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/28/tradfi-firms-invest-in-ethereum-etfs-as-netflows-rebound/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=tradfi-firms-invest-in-ethereum-etfs-as-netflows-rebound,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

TRUMP'S TEAM CONSIDERS PAUL ATKINS FOR SEC LEADERSHIP ROLE: REPORT – President-elect Donald Trump’s team is considering Paul Atkins, a seasoned financial regulator, to replace Gary Gensler as Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), per Politico. Who is Paul… https://t.co/3WSWJz31mN pic.twitter.com/ViMp3h960K — BSCN (@BSCNews) November 28, 2024 Atkins’ lead in Kalshi’s poll comes just days after Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett spoked to anonymous sources who revealed that Atkins is the favorite amongst Trump’s transition team to nab the coveted regulatory role. According to Terrett, Atkins – who previously served under SEC chairs Richard Breeden and Arthur Levitt – is not only “crypto savvy,” but has a “deep understanding of the inner workings of the agency.” “Atkins is seen as being capable of establishing a pro-innovation agenda while returning the agency to the so-called “gold standard” many in the Republican Party feel was lost under outgoing chair Gary Gensler,” Terrett said in a November 26 X post. SEC Chair Gary Gensler Resigning Current SEC Chair Gary Gensler has long been slammed by Trump for his regulation-by-enforcement approach to the blockchain sector , with the former reality television star vowing to fire the federal regulator upon returning to the Oval Office. Just last week, Gensler announced his intention to step down from his position at the federal agency ahead of Trump’s inauguration come January. “The Securities and Exchange Commission is a remarkable agency,” Gensler said in a recent statement. “It has been an honor of a lifetime to serve with them on behalf of everyday Americans and ensure that our capital markets remain the best in the world.” Shortly following Gensler’s announcement, SEC Commissioner Jaime Lizárraga announced his intention to resign from the agency. “Until my departure in January, I will remain fully engaged in the Commission’s ongoing work and activities,” he said in a November 22 statement. With both Gensler and Lizárraga stepping down, Trump will have jurisdiction over who will take their positions, effectively shaping the regulatory direction of the SEC itself.

36961973,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=103184,1732808638,Solana Cup and Handle Formation Suggests Incoming 92% Surge to $375,"While Solana (SOL) trades at $235, down 10.13% from its ATH, a bullish ""cup and handle"" pattern signals potential growth. Solana has registered a notable price decline after hitting an all-time high of $263.21 on November 23. At the time of writing, SOL is worth $235.21, with a slight 0.1% increase over the last 24 hours.However, on the 14-day and 30-day timeframes, Solana maintains more significant upward momentum, with gains of 6% and 30%, respectively. Now, analysts and on-chain metrics suggest that Solana is riding a broader bullish trend, supported by positive technical indicators and growing ecosystem developments.Technical Patterns Indicate Bullish ContinuationChart analysis from TradingView reveals a ""cup and handle"" formation for Solana’s price action. This pattern, which typically signals a bullish continuation, emerged after prolonged accumulation. The ""cup"" section of the pattern, visible between late 2022 and mid-2024, formed a rounded bottom, with the lowest point recorded near $7. The ""handle"" followed, forming a downward channel from March 2024 before the breakout occurred. SOLUSDT 1-week Chart, TradingView Further supporting the bullish outlook is an AB=CD harmonic pattern on the same chart, showing symmetry in price movements. The AB segment began with a dramatic 1797% increase, rising from $7 to $179.Following the handle’s consolidation, the CD segment is projected to mirror this movement, targeting $375.98. This suggests a potential 92.39% surge from its current price. However, analysts warn that confirmation of this breakout will depend on a weekly candle close above key resistance levels.In another analysis on TradingView, Solana is seen trading within an ascending channel on the 4-hour timeframe, with a key resistance level at $260. A break above this resistance could push the price towards $290, the next significant target.Alternatively, if Solana faces rejection at the $260 resistance, a temporary pullback within the ascending channel could affect short-term price action. SOLUSDT 4-hour Chart, TradingView Rising TVL Reflects StrengthIn addition to price action, Solana’s ecosystem continues to show signs of resilience, particularly in its Total Value Locked (TVL). As of November 28, TVL rose to $8.97 billion over the past seven days, reflecting increased user activity and growing confidence in the platform. SOL TVL, DefiLlama While TVL remains below its historical high of around $10 billion, this recent growth signals further potential if favorable market conditions persist.

However, ETH has recently recovered and has surpassed $3,600, increasing by over 4% in the last 24 hours. This increase also motivated Ethereum co-founder Jeffrey Wilcke.

36963188,https://cryptonews.com/?p=313670,1732808272,Charts Show Strong Bullish Signals For These Two Altcoins In The Next Week,"Two altcoins—Algorand and Decentraland—could be on the verge of major rallies, according to technical analysis. Recently, the cryptocurrency market has experienced significant turbulence, with Bitcoin (BTC) leading a broad sell-off. After touching $99,690 on Nov. 22, the leading cryptocurrency fell briefly to $90,796 and then rebounded to the current price of $95,435, posting a slight recovery of 0.6% in the last 24 hours. Given a backdrop of complicated geopolitical tensions, safe-haven assets such as Bitcoin and gold are under selling pressure. This is further exacerbated by growing concerns about Trump’s tariff threats, which increase tension in global markets. Against this volatile backdrop, we analyzed CoinGlass ‘ RSI thermography for potential buy signals. Two cryptocurrencies in particular, Algorand ($ALGO) and Decentraland ($MANA), have emerged as promising buying opportunities, underpinned by strong technical indicators. The 12-hour average relative strength index ( RSI ) stands at 57.03, reflecting balanced market sentiment and moderate momentum in the cryptocurrency sector. Algorand ($ALGO) Algorand’s ALGO has shown strong momentum, positioning itself as an attractive option for traders and investors. ALGO’s 12-hour RSI stands out at 69.16, significantly higher than the crypto market average of 57.03. Crypto market RSI indicator for the ALGO token – Source: CoinGlass Its weekly RSI of 73.07 further emphasises the bullish momentum, reflecting sustained buying pressure over an extended time frame. Currently trading at $0.3026 , ALGO has shown remarkable price stability, gaining 9.51% in the last 24 hours. This consistent performance signals a build-up phase, indicating investor confidence rather than speculative trading. It is important to note that ALGO’s RSI remains below the overbought threshold , suggesting room for further growth without the immediate risk of a pullback. These factors make ALGO a strong candidate for investors seeking a mix of momentum and stability in the current market. Decentraland (MANA) Decentraland also has a strong buy signal, supported by a bullish RSI metric that reflects sustained demand and good resistance. The 12-hour RSI of 63.45 and the 24-hour RSI of 65.9 are well above the market average and signal strong buying interest and momentum. Thermograph of the crypto market RSI indicator for the MANA token – Source: CoinGlass The weekly RSI of 63.12 strengthens confidence in its long-term potential, although the one-hour RSI of 42.46 shows short-term consolidation. This period of consolidation represents a strategic entry point for new buyers before the next potential rally. Despite the heavy price drop of 18.52% in course of 12 hours yesterday, MANA’s RSI metric indicates that it is not yet in oversold territory. This suggests that the decline was more of a market correction than a sign of fundamental weakness. Currently, MANA is up 2.81% to $0.6 , remaining an attractive opportunity for investors looking to capitalize on potential recovery and growth. In a market characterized by volatility and uncertainty, Algorand and Decentraland emerged as notable candidates this week. Both cryptocurrencies feature solid RSI metrics, indicating bullish momentum. However, it is crucial to recognize that short-term market fluctuations can affect their trajectories. Investors are advised to be cautious, conduct thorough research, and ensure that their investment strategies align with their risk tolerance and long-term financial goals. Beyond Algorand and Decentraland: How One Meme Coin is Changing the Sector for the Better Investors looking to diversify their portfolios should consider small, prudent allocations towards a potentially explosive new meme coins. The weird and wonderful world of micro-cap meme coin ICOs (aka presales), where many new species of meme coin are just launching, offers investors a chance to buy into projects before they hit the open market.

Will they now break higher? Total3 heading to all-time high Source: TradingView Total3 is the chart for the combined market cap of all cryptocurrencies except $BTC and $ETH. So it’s a good chart for tracking how the altcoins are progressing. It can be seen that the bull flag broke to the upside, and the descending trendline has been broken. So far so good. If Total3 can now get above the all-time high of $1.13 trillion, it could be said that the final, and the most dramatic stage of the bull market would be well upon us. $BNB at the edge of breaking out of a 4-year range Source: TradingView $BNB (BNB/USD) has been traversing inside a very large trading range since early 2021. Following the end of the 2021 bull market, the price drifted downwards and bumped along the bottom of the range at around $200. Later in 2023, the price started to climb higher, and has now been knocking at the door of the top of the range at around $660. After such a long period of sideways consolidation it might be expected that $BNB will now break through the top of the range and go into price discovery. The targets for the rest of this bull market are based on the Fibonacci extension levels, and can be taken from the chart above. $NEAR at descending trendline once again Source: TradingView $NEAR is very near to breaking out. Puns aside, this really does look to be the case. A descending trendline that stretches all the way back to the beginning of 2022 is currently acting as resistance once again. However, with the price now holding above the 0.236 Fibonacci, a breakout may not be far away. If the breakout takes place, the first target will be to get above the next Fibonacci level at $8.53, but more importantly, the $NEAR bulls will need to push the price a little further than this and take out the swing high at $9.11. If this can occur, the downtrend will have been officially broken, and it would likely be onwards and upwards from there. $FTM currently breaking out Source: TradingView Of the three altcoins discussed in this article, $FTM is the only one to actually be currently breaking out. Also on the 2-week time frame, it can be seen that $FTM is currently above the descending trendline, although it must be taken into account that there are still three days left before the candle completes. That said, if $FTM is able to hold above by the end of play on Sunday, and Bitcoin is able to avoid another big drop, the $FTM bulls will be looking to take out the all-time high at $3.45.

36958812,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=103157,1732807508,Top Analyst Says Cardano Could Target $10 After Redistribution Around $1,"Analyst Dan Gambardello recently reflected on the $1 milestone for Cardano (ADA), stating that the ongoing consolidation and redistribution phase will likely propel the token toward $5–$10 targets. Cardano's recapture of the long-lost $1 mark this month represents a significant milestone, especially considering its recent challenges. After struggling to break this psychological barrier for years, the token's recent performance demonstrates its resilience in the market.ADA is currently ranked as the ninth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Over the past 24 hours, ADA registered a 2.19% increase, adding to its 27.07% gain over the last week. At the time of reporting, Cardano's price stood at $0.9987.Cardano Could Target $5–$10 After $1 Consolidation PhaseThe price movement has generated significant commentary from analysts and the broader crypto community. In his commentary, Gambardello noted how many observers failed to conceive that ADA could ever hit $1 again. He also mentioned how some holders have considered the $1 mark a favorable point to exit the Cardano market.Notably, since surpassing the $1 level, Cardano's bull run lost momentum, and the asset has been consolidating around the $0.999 region. Gambardello views this ongoing consolidation in a favorable light, seeing it as a window for redistribution.He went on to project that once this phase is over, Cardano could focus on breaking higher milestones, such as $5 and $10.Interestingly, more optimistic forecasts from other analysts predict that ADA could reach $10 to $12 within the next 6 to 12 months. This projection aligns with broader bullish expectations for large-cap cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin (BTC) at $250,000 and Ethereum (ETH) at $7,000.Cardano Whale Accumulation is Growing Meanwhile, whales are positioning themselves for the Cardano bull run. As reported, ADA whales recently accumulated over 130 million ADA following the dip after the asset surpassed the $1 mark. Following this accumulation, their holdings were elevated to 3.2 billion ADA tokens as of November 27.Notably, these whales' accumulations have mirrored Cardano's uptick over the last month. While instances of profit-taking have been observed, the price of ADA has barely shown any impact, maintaining a consistent uptrend over the last three weeks.",POSITIVE,ADA | BTC | ETH,ADA | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/28/top-analyst-says-cardano-could-target-10-after-redistribution-around-1/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=top-analyst-says-cardano-could-target-10-after-redistribution-around-1,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

According to a Bloomberg report citing data from DefiLlama, the market capitalization of stablecoins has increased by 46% this year, reaching a record of about $191.6 billion at the time of writing. Stablecoin Market Value Up 50% Since January According to recent statistics from DefiLlama, the overall value of stablecoins has gradually accelerated upwards over the last 12 months, showcased by a more than 50% increase from the beginning of 2024 to date. Tether, the world’s largest stablecoin issuer, has seen the circulation of its USDT token reach approximately $133 billion, accounting for about 69% of the global market for such assets. The other big player in the market, USDC , saw its market value rise to $39.5 billion after ending the financial year 2023 with $24 billion in circulation. The Circle-issued stablecoin holds 21% of the global market share. In 2022, after the fall of TerraUSD, which fueled a market crash, the total value of stablecoins reportedly plummeted by $19 billion. Almost two and a half years later, the sector soared to new heights, reaching nearly $170 billion in August. President-elect Donald Trump’s bullish crypto stance has also helped rally the digital assets market, pushing several cryptocurrencies to new all-time highs, including a Bitcoin surge past $99,000. Additionally, data from Coingecko shows that the overall value of the crypto market has increased by $0.88 trillion since Trump won. Expectations on Crypto Adoption Grow Elsewhere, there’s growing optimism that stablecoins will soon be more relevant to global trade, specifically cross-border transactions. At the forefront of this is Tether, which recently announced it had completed its first-ever crude oil transaction from the Middle East. In October, the company’s investment division reportedly sponsored a physical crude oil transaction between a publicly traded supermajor oil firm and a top commodity dealer. The intent to use stablecoins has also been ignited in the United Kingdom, whose policymakers plan to build a crypto regulatory framework come 2025, as Economic Secretary Tulip Siddiq revealed . Investors in the UK were hopeful of a regulatory environment change, as the previous Conservative government placed crypto use under the country’s payment laws. According to Tulip, the new Labour government will implement a plan laid out by its predecessor to regulate stablecoins. Policymakers are also seeking to ease the stringent rules the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) imposes on the registration of crypto companies.

36958749,https://btc-pulse.com/?p=27521,1732807443,Trump Administration Could Reshape Treasury’s Stance on Tornado Cash,"Trump Administration Might Change Treasury’s Stance on Tornado Cash The crypto industry is closely watching how the United States Treasury might change its approach to Tornado Cash sanctions under a new presidential administration. A recent appellate court decision challenges the Treasury’s handling of the case, potentially paving the way for policy shifts in 2025. Court Ruling Challenges OFAC’s Authority On Nov. 26, the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled that the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) overstepped its authority when it sanctioned Tornado Cash’s immutable smart contracts in 2022. Though not final, this ruling has paved the way for further litigation in lower courts, where plaintiffs backed by Coinbase may advocate for reforms in how crypto mixers are treated under the law. The ruling comes as a major victory for some in the crypto industry who have argued that sanctioning immutable smart contracts sets a dangerous precedent for decentralized technology. Trump’s Treasury May Bring Policy Shifts Some speculate that this could change should Donald Trump return to the presidency in 2025 and decide to revise the Treasury’s approach to Tornado Cash and other similar cases. According to Bill Hughes, senior counsel at Consensys, a Trump Treasury might absorb the court’s analysis and apply it to its policymaking, perhaps even softening its crypto sanction regime. The new administration will also usher in fresh leadership as Scott Bessent takes over the Treasury secretary’s role. It is perceived that Bessent’s approach toward the regulation of cryptocurrency would shape the way the Treasury balances interests of innovation with national security concerns. Developers Face Ongoing Legal Challenges Tornado Cash developers remain under scrutiny, with ongoing legal battles further complicating the situation. Co-founder Roman Storm faces trial in April 2025, while Roman Semenov is listed as one of the FBI’s most wanted individuals. Meanwhile, Alexey Pertsev, another co-founder, is serving a prison sentence in the Netherlands for money laundering, though his legal team plans to appeal. Implications for Crypto Regulation The changing legal and regulatory environment surrounding Tornado Cash has profound implications for the crypto space. A lighter-touch position from the Trump administration would create a useful precedent in how regulators will approach the concept of decentralized platforms and smart contracts going forward under US law.

36958594,https://finbold.com/?p=215564,1732807111,Khabib ‘supports’ new crypto riding Conor McGregor civil case,"Under the stewardship of CEO Dana White, the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UCF) has become one of the biggest, if not the biggest organization in martial arts today. Just like the company’s CEO, plenty of the most respected UFC athletes are involved in the cryptocurrency industry — in fact, at one point, fighters even earned bonuses in the form of cryptocurrency . However, this association hasn’t always gone over smoothly — most notably, earlier this year, Khamzat Chimaev was linked to a scam surrounding Smash (SMASH), his own cryptocurrency project that was promptly revealed to bear the markings of a typical pump and dump by online sleuth ZachXBT — with roughly 80% of the supply in wallets linked to Khamzat . Chimaev has since pinned the blame on his manager . Now, a new crypto token is being ‘supported’ by yet another UFC star — Khabib Nurmagomedov. One of Nurmagomedov’s chief rivals in the octagon, Connor McGregor, was recently found liable in a civil case for rape, which he is set to appeal soon. This project, titled Convict McGregor (CONVICT) was praised by Khabib in an X post on November 27 , although this is likely more due to his rivalry with the Irishman rather than any credibility of this project. “Good job guys, you have my full support, this guy deserve [sic] punishment.” Good job guys , you have my full support, this guy deserve punishment https://t.co/tOFNJrBUYV — khabib nurmagomedov (@TeamKhabib) November 27, 2024 The project claims that its purpose is to donate toward the legal fees of McGregor’s victims — however, not everything appears to be as it seems — and with previous instances of fraud having occurred so recently, many are worried that this apparently well-intentioned cryptocurrency is yet another scam. Is Convict McGregor yet another crypto scam? CONVICT has certainly experienced its fair share of activity — although the total market capitalization of the cryptocurrency is between $362,000 and $368,000 as per CoinMarketCap , at the time of writing, volume for the past 24 hours stood at $1.61 million. At the time of publication, CONVICT trading Solana’s ( SOL ) DEX Raydium, an automated market maker (AMM) platform, was priced at $0.0003605 — down from the previous day’s high of $0.0014463. This drop equates to a 74.99% move to the downside — if it truly was a pump and dump, the scheme has already concluded. Buying and selling transactions are quite evenly matched at present, and most recent transactions are small — rarely exceeding $100. CONVICT price chart. Source: CoinMarketCap Most notably, a visit to the token’s website reveals a pretty suspicious disclosure at the bottom of the home page, which states: “Convict McGregor” is a satirical memecoin inspired by public reports of Conor McGregor being found liable for sexual assault in a civil case. This is not a criminal conviction. The coin and its content are purely for entertainment and meme culture. Always verify facts and invest responsibly! Nurmagomedov himself has previously been involved in an NFT project that was subsequently dubbed a scam by many. Although the promotion is most likely well-intentioned on Khabib’s part, a non-transparent project like this is best given a wide berth and avoided altogether.

Positioned as the “all-sport” meme coin, XYZ aims to unify sports enthusiasts under a single token, adding a layer of utility to the meme genre.

This new cat coin aims to save the crypto world from the pack of dog coins like Dogecoin , Shiba Inu, and others. With its playful and unique theme, MEW brings a fresh perspective to the market. It offers a new mascot for investors to rally behind, appealing to those who love cats or simply want something different. MEW’s potential lies in its commitment to being more than just another meme coin. It focuses on building a strong community, fostering innovation, and creating real value for its holders. In the current market cycle, many investors are searching for the next big thing beyond the well-known dog coins. MEW appears as an attractive option, tapping into the trend of seeking fresh and exciting projects. Compared to other coins, MEW stands out with its feline charm and determination to challenge the status quo. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, MEW might just be the cat that brings a new balance to the market. With growing interest and a dedicated team, MEW could be poised to make a significant impact in the world of cryptocurrencies. BOOK OF MEME The BOOK OF MEME (BOME) is an experimental project shaking up the web3 world. It brings together memes, decentralized storage, and the thrill of degen trading and gambling. BOME aims to capture the ever-changing meme culture in a digital compendium, ensuring each meme is stored forever on the blockchain. By using Solana for the BOME memecoin and harnessing storage solutions like Arweave and IPFS, the project makes memes unstoppable. Future expansions plan to use Bitcoin inscriptions for immutable storage, fostering a new kind of decentralized social media where memes are immortalized. In today’s market, where meme coins often grab headlines, BOME stands out by offering more than hype. It combines cultural relevance with advanced technology, tapping into the heart of internet culture. The BOME coin could be attractive to those who see potential in merging memes with blockchain innovation. Compared to other coins, BOME is carving its own niche by making memes a permanent part of the digital landscape. While the crypto market is always volatile, the unique approach of BOME might appeal to those looking for the next big thing in Web3 culture.

36959092,https://cryptonews.com/?p=313709,1732806872,Why the XRP Price Could Hit $40 in 3 Months as Ripple News Excites Market,"The XRP price is ripping higher – up 29% in the past seven days to $1.47 – on the back of mounting positive news flow, and could hit $40 in three months. If the XRP price pattern repeats the behavior last seen in 2017, then it could breach $40 – 28x move from the current price, according to one crypto trader. In early 2017 we saw the first big #XRP explosion. If the charts repeats, the price targets will be $1.96, $6.30 and $40 for the next three months. pic.twitter.com/C7hVjCI9MX — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) November 22, 2024 A steady stream of bullish news for Ripple and its liquidity token suggests that such an XRP price prediction , although at the extremes, is possible. Here’s the news that’s propelling the XRP price higher today XRP issue Ripple’s investment in an exchange-traded product and its involvement in the tokenization of real-world assets (RWA) in the form of a money market fund has added to XRP price momentum. And that’s not to mention the continued afterglow from the news that SEC chairman Gary Gensler is stepping down on January 20. News that Ripple is investing in the newly rebranded European XRP ETP, which will henceforth be known as the Bitwise Physical XRP ETP , saw the price of XRP jump 7.3% yesterday to $1.49. Ripple CEO Brad Garinghouse commenting on the news said: “Global demand for exposure to the crypto asset class has exploded in 2024, fueled by a growing interest in crypto-backed investment offerings. “With the US regulatory environment for crypto finally becoming more clear, this trend is poised to accelerate, further driving demand for crypto ETPs, such as the Bitwise Physical XRP ETP.” He added: “As one of the most valuable, liquid, and utility-driven digital assets, XRP is at the forefront of this momentum, standing out as a cornerstone for those seeking access to assets that are resilient and have real-world utility.” In a sign of the burgeoning interest in crypto ETFs beyond bitcoin and Ethereum, WisdomTree recently filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to register an XRP ETF. Hate it or love it, XRP is the most resilient Crypto asset around. https://t.co/KWfbYUJku8 — John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) November 25, 2024 In the European Union crypto exchange-traded products have been available to retail and institutional investors for some years. Ripple invests $5 million in tokenized money market fund built by Archas on the XRP Ledger The news of Ripple’s planned investment in the Bitwise Physcial XRP ETP follows on from another major development. On Monday, UK-regulated crypto exchange Archas opened access to a tokenized version of a money market fund from asset manager Abrdn. Although the extent of Ripple’s investment in the ETP has not been disclosed, the company did reveal that it is investing $5 million in the new tokens for Abrdn’s US dollar Liquidity Fund (Lux). Archax and Ripple have been in a business relationship since 2022 and the tokenized version of the Abrdn fund will run on the XRP Ledger blockchain. According to McKinsey, the tokenization of money market funds now exceeds $1 billion in assets under management. Furthermore, Boston Consulting Group and digital assets manager 21Shares estimate that tokenized assets could be an addressable market of $16 trillion by 2030. The fractionalization of financial assets, as well as other assets like fine art and classic cars, can deliver operational efficiencies and greater liquidity, especially in those types of alternative investments traditionally harder to access. Ripple and XRP at the forefront of a new breed of crypto killer apps that tokenize real-world assets “Financial institutions are understanding the value of adopting digital assets for real-world use cases,” said Graham Rodford, CEO, Archax. “There is now real momentum building for tokenized real-world assets, and Archax is at the forefront of tokenizing assets such as equities, debt instruments and money market funds. “In collaboration with Ripple, we are excited to help our clients such as abrdn, which manages over half a trillion pounds in assets (as at Q2 2024), to bring them to the XRPL using Archax’s tokenization engine. Institutional buyers can now purchase abrdn’s Lux fund directly from Archax in token form.” The good news just keeps on coming for Ripple’s technology and its XRP liquidity token In other price-supportive news for XRP, online broker Robinhood recently announced that along with Solana (SOL), Pepe (PEPE) and Cardano (ADA), it would be relisting XRP. A number of crypto assets had been removed by the brokerage for regulatory reasons, as a result of the SEC considering them to be unregistered securities. On the technology side, XRP Ledger Server v2.3.0 was released three days ago and brings Multi-Purpose Tokens (MPTs) to the blockchain. These are special types of fungible tokens that can be used for more than one transaction, such as for paying recurring bills. Other XRP Ledger upgrades relate to improving the operations of Automated Market Makers, transaction replay options and better NFT functionality. Builders and investors are also exploring XRP Ledger meme coin projects , which have proven increasingly popular in recent weeks. How high will the XRP price fly? XRP touched a near-term high of $1.60 on November 23 but has since been rangebound between $1.30 and $1.50, 61% below its all-time high of $3.84. Perpetual futures open interest has reached record levels, reading $1.8 billion on Tuesday 26th in a strongly bullish signal, and had spiked as high as $2.26 four days earlier. Since late August, the XRP futures funding rate , averaged across all exchanges, has been printing higher lows. In November, it rose to its highest levels since April, hitting 0.023% on November 25. The funding rate determines how much interest each side of the trade pays. A positive figure means that the longs pay the shorts. However, when it is in positive territory, it also means that buyers are confident that the price will rise, hence their willingness to pay the positive funding rate. But if the funding rate is too high, it cuts into profits and heightens the risk for those holding long contracts. As you will see when the SEC’s brief is made public tomorrow, they ask the Judge for $2B in fines and penalties. 1/4 https://t.co/HM8dBbn7lp — Stuart Alderoty (@s_alderoty) March 25, 2024 The volatility in the funding rate in Q1 2024 reflects the uncertainty surrounding the SEC lawsuit. On March 25, for example, the SEC proposed a settlement, which would have involved Ripple paying almost $2 billion in penalties. Since then, as we know, there has been a historic US presidential election, and XRP market sentiment has changed markedly. Although the lawsuit is still there, the chances of the SEC winning it have shrunk considerably. XRP price prediction – could the CFTC pick be the news that blasts XRP on a journey $40? XRP price predictions must take into account the fast-moving development at Mar-a-Lago. Although it is not yet known who the SEC chairman will be, Trump is likely to put in place someone who is pro-crypto. Bloomberg reports today that the new administration could do what the crypto industry has always wanted, which was to entrust regulation to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Most or all the names that have been circulating as potential contenders to replace Rostin Behnam as head of the derivatives regulator would likely be friendly toward the roughly $3 trillion crypto market. Republican commissioners Summer Mersinger and Caroline Pham have been considered, according to people familiar with the discussions. Others include Joshua Sterling, Jill Sommers and Neal Kumar — former CFTC officials who have worked with digital-asset firms, the people said. Bloomberg, November 27, 2024 Thanksgiving Day is now upon us. The holiday period could usher in bullish trading patterns, with the traditional financial markets all closing early in the US. Open interest and the funding rate both point to powerful buying energy when the XRP uptrend resumes. An XRP price that smashes the previous ATH is still in play by the end of the year, with $5, or even $10 , a possibility going into the new year, especially if the positive newsflow from Ripple continues and we hear more crypto-friendly news from the incoming administration. This is borne out by the volume profile (see chart immediately below), which provides a window on the buying (and selling) interest at chosen price points. The point of control (red line) coincides with the current price, which means we are at a price level of maximum interest since the period from November 5 , when the election was held, to today. As far as relative price performance goes, the only top alt that has beaten XRP since the election is Cardano (ADA), where Charles Hoskinson’s closeness to the possible new policy council that the Trump team may be putting together, has helped ADA to outperform. If you are on the hunt for a token to invest in this altcoin season, then XRP probably has the most upside and the lowest risk of the majors. Its technology is robust, and its price has been underperforming since the SEC lawsuit mess of the past four years, so it has lots of catching up to do, and it has an army of token holders that will keep it front and center of the crypto bull market story going into the new year and beyond.

As such, here are the best meme coins to buy now. Pepe Unchained Pepe Unchained is an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain that offers 100x faster speeds and is much cheaper than the Ethereum main network. It aims to be the home for meme coins inside the Ethereum ecosystem. So, considering Ethereum’s strength this week, it’s no surprise that Pepe Unchained is also seeing growth. It’s currently undergoing a presale and has raised over $55 million to develop its blockchain. However, the ICO will end in 15 days, and then PEPU will be listed on exchanges. The Pepe Chain will launch after the ICO ends and will include features like a block explorer, a dedicated Ethereum bridge, staking, a decentralized exchange, and a two-click meme coin generator. The team is also running a grants program where it pays people to build projects on the chain. Coupled with its no-code meme coin launchpad, this indicates that Pepe Chain will become a vibrant ecosystem. For more information, visit the Pepe Unchained presale website . CatSlap CatSlap is another Ethereum-based meme coin showing potential. The project is newly launched and is currently trading at a 1,600% premium from its launch price. However, it remains a low market cap opportunity, holding a valuation of just $20 million. Moreover, it recently underwent a selloff and redistribution phase, creating a healthy price chart ahead of the next leg up. CatSlap is a cat-themed meme coin that offers multiple features that other cat coins do not – this includes the CatSlap Slapomter gamified experience and staking. There are also talks that the team will expand the gamified experience into a full-swing Play-to-Earn game. No other cat-themed meme coins offer that. CatSlap is available to buy on the decentralized exchange widget on its website or via the Best Wallet app via the Upcoming Tokens feature. For more information, visit the CatSlap website . Crypto All-Stars Crypto All-Stars is a unique cryptocurrency that lets users stake their meme coins for passive rewards. The platform pays STARS tokens to those who stake DOGE, SHIB, PEPE, BONK, and others. Based on the tokens it supports, it has multichain functionality. This is a big breakthrough and a real driver of its early success. STARS is an integral part of the Crypto All-Stars ecosystem. Users must hold it to maximize their rewards, and they can also stake it for further growth. Currently, STARS staking offers a 310% APY. Crypto All-Stars is a unique crossover of meme coin and utility token. This makes it appealing to a wider range of investors, especially those who want exposure to the meme coin market without too much volatility. As such, STARS is in high demand. It’s undergoing a presale that has raised $6.4 million so far – but it ends in 22 days. For more information, visit Crypto All-Stars presale website .

Ethereum ( ETH ) outperformed the broader crypto market, rising 11.65% to a high of $3,688, as capital rotated from Bitcoin ( BTC ). The surge comes as Bitcoin reclaimed the critical $95,000 level on Nov. 27, following in-line PCE price index results. However, Ethereum’s relative strength continues to build. The ETH/BTC ratio currently stands at 0.03760, up 17.8% from the prior week, analysts at QCP Capital noted. “With BTC dominance breaking down from its high at 61.50%, ETHBTC has held up nicely and is currently at 0.03760, up 17.8% from last week. This brings 0.0400 into focus as the next level to watch.” QCP Capital You might also like: Bitcoin nears $100k: history repeating or a new chapter in crypto?

As crypto.news reported earlier, Ethereum’s daily charts indicate bullish patterns, including the potential for a golden cross as the 200-day and 50-day Exponential Moving Averages approach a bullish crossover. Ethereum’s decentralized finance ecosystem has also seen growth.

However, with the subsequent recovery, Bitcoin rose to $95,000, and while investors were trying to predict which direction BTC would move, the latest data came from the cryptocurrency tracking platform Coinglass. Bitcoin’s price action is set to trigger major liquidation events on mainstream cryptocurrency exchanges (CEX), according to the latest data from Coinglass. “At this point, if the Bitcoin price drops below $94,000, $1.05 billion worth of long positions will be liquidated. In contrast, $811 million worth of BTC short positions on CEXs will be liquidated if Bitcoin rises above $97,000.” According to current data, $280 million worth of leveraged transactions were liquidated in the last 24 hours, while $113.4 million worth of long positions and $167.3 million worth of short positions were liquid. Again, while 98,394 traders were liquidated in the last 24 hours, the largest liquidation occurred in the ETH/USD transaction on BitMEX. *This is not investment advice.

Bitcoin ETF buzz, Ethereum’s $6k potential, and Yeti Ouro’s MemeFi rise reshape the crypto landscape with new opportunities. Table of Contents Bitcoin ETF momentum and market dynamics Ethereum headed to $6,000? Yeti Ouro: The viral MemeFi token changing P2E gaming The crypto market is experiencing a number of activities, driven by activities such as Bitcoin ETF inflows, bullish Ethereum price predictions, and the rise of a MemeFi ERC-20 token, Yeti Ouro (YETIO). With institutional interest surging and the Play-to-Earn (P2E) market rapidly evolving, investors are eyeing these trends for the next big opportunity. Bitcoin ETF momentum and market dynamics On Friday, November 22, Bitcoin price hit an all-time high of $99,768. However, BTC has struggled to surpass the critical $99,800 resistance, leading to a sharp overnight decline. Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $435.3 million in outflows, halting a five-day streak of consecutive inflows. Despite this pullback, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) stood out with $267.8 million in inflows, reflecting growing institutional confidence in the asset. Analysts suggest that ETF-driven demand could push Bitcoin back into the “BUY” zone on the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart, a tool widely used to gauge BTC’s long-term potential. Ethereum headed to $6,000? Ethereum is on the brink of a significant price movement, with analysts like Byzantine General highlighting a record high in Ethereum futures open interest (OI). This surge in OI suggests heightened speculation around ETH’s future price trajectory, despite the current downtrend intact since May 2024. Ethereum price at the time of press is $3,571.44, reflecting a 7.37% increase in the last 24 hours and a total market cap of over $430 billion. With the current trajectory, analysts believe a breakout above Ethereum’s descending trendline could pave the way for a sustained rally toward $6,000, supported by robust fundamentals like increasing DeFi adoption and Ethereum’s role in powering innovative projects.

36959091,https://cryptonews.com/?p=313747,1732805942,FreeDum Fighters Raises $650K in ICO as MAGATRON Starts New PolitiFi Era – 9 Days Left to Secure 221x Returns Like MAGA,"FreeDum Fighters ($DUM) charges into the final nine days of its presale, with over $650,000 raised. This new PolitiFi project skyrocketed in popularity during the final weeks of the U.S. presidential race and has become a sought-after platform for settling the political scores that were dominating headlines. With MAGATRON – Donald Trump’s mechanized, blockchain-powered avatar – emerging as the winner in the battle for supremacy, FreeDum Fighters is on a mission to usher in a new era of political discourse in the world of crypto. What makes FreeDum Fighters stand out? It’s proven to be just as accurate as betting platforms like Polymarket – but with one crucial difference: no matter which candidate you backed, FreeDum Fighters gives you returns, making it an actual win-win scenario for everyone. However, when the presale buzzer sounds on December 9, it would be difficult to secure the price of $DUM at its current low prices. Right now, one $DUM is priced at $0.000103 per token , but the price is slated for an increase in the next 10 hours as the project moves up to its last few stages of its fundraising campaign. The new era of PolitiFi amid the return of Trump’s ‘maximum pressure’ As President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House, the return of his first-term policies is expected to shake things up once again. Trump’s reintroduction of tariffs as a key tool in his international negotiations puts “maximum pressure” on both allies and adversaries to bend to his will. But what’s different this time around? A newfound alliance with the crypto world. We’re already seeing signs of this shift, with Paul Atkins – a crypto-savvy, pro-technology candidate – emerging as a favorite to replace Gary Gensler as SEC Chairman. NEW: Former SEC commissioner Paul Atkins is said to still be the favorite among top transition team members to lead the @SECGov , according to two sources close to discussions at Mar-a-Lago. @FoxBusiness , @CGasparino reported earlier this week that Atkins was in the lead for the… — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) November 27, 2024 The crypto-friendly atmosphere emerging under Trump’s upcoming administration could permanently lock in a six-figure price for Bitcoin and provide continuous fuel to this year’s rally, extending to 2025. One sector benefiting from this shift is meme coins , which have shed their “joke” status and are now collectively valued at $113 billion – that’s 20x more than meme coin skeptic and Kamacop 9000 supporter Mark Cuban’s entire net worth. But the real twist? The rise of PolitiFi meme coins, which combine the viral nature of memes with political discourse. PolitiFi tokens have exploded in value alongside the general meme coin boom. And now, there’s a new player shaking things up in this space: FreeDum Fighters. With more and more politically inclined crypto in the know, FreeDum Fighters has emerged as a platform for resolving contentious political debates, which could help elevate the PolitiFi sector, especially in the wake of the U.S. elections. Everyone wins with FreeDum Fighters Leading up to November 5, early investors in FreeDum Fighters have used the platform’s two staking protocols to cast their votes for their preferred candidates: Trump as MAGATRON or Harris as Kamacop 9000. The advantage of this over betting was clear. Early contributors who staked funds in Kamacop 9000 still enjoyed solid returns, unlike those who bet it all on Kamala Harris via Polymarket. Yet, its accuracy makes FreeDum Fighters comparable to Polymarket. Even though MAGATRON’s staking pool attracted more funds, resulting in lower APYs, investors were undeterred and continued showing strong support for Trump. But beyond the staking feature, FreeDum Fighters engages its community via social media by allowing them to voice their political opinions, defend their chosen candidates, and participate in debates. In fact, winners of these debates receive token airdrops, which makes participation rewarding. We have our winner of the $DUM debate #1: The winner is Kamacop 9000, for debating against the statement: MAGATRON's hair is the pinnacle of American engineering. Just like McDonald's is the pinnacle of American cuisine. All prizes will be paid at a later time closer to TGE. https://t.co/kKH0T0dtDU — FreeDum Fighters (@Freedum_Fighter) November 13, 2024 But FreeDum Fighters isn’t stopping there. It expands its universe by adding meme coins to the mix, each representing a political figurehead’s “posse.” For example, Dogecoin joins MAGATRON and Dark Maga (aka Elon Musk), while Pepe joins Kamacop 9000 and Sleepy Joe. It’ll be exciting to watch how things unfold as the project matures, but with the early investor buzz already in full swing, it’s clear there’s serious potential to cash in on this one soon. FreeDum Fighters is ready to capture a 221x return like $MAGA With the FreeDum Fighters ecosystem continuing to evolve and its proven accuracy in predicting political outcomes, not to mention a potential Trump-led U.S. in 2025, the project’s future within the PolitiFi and meme coin sectors looks incredibly promising. Investing in the presale offers an opportunity to acquire $DUM tokens at their lowest price point, setting the stage for potentially massive returns — much like MAGA ($TRUMP), which soared from its 2023 all-time low. Just imagine: a $1,000 investment could turn into a $220,000 profit — a life-changing scenario. And it’s not just speculation. Trusted crypto news outlet CryptoNews has analyzed $ DUM’s price trajectory, predicting it could reach $0.00109 in 2024, representing an impressive 958% return from its current price. Even popular crypto influencer ClayBro forecasts a more modest, but still significant, 25x return for FreeDum Fighters — far from the 221x potential, but still a wealth-changing opportunity for early investors. How to buy $DUM in presale To buy FreeDum Fighters at presale, head to the project’s official website and connect your wallet. Thanks to multi-chain support, you can purchase $DUM tokens with a variety of options, including Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Base, and Solana. Accepted payments include ETH, BSC, BASE, SOL, USDT, and USDC.

It’s a token that’s directly tied to the famous NPC meme, one of the most popular internet jokes about people acting like “non-playable characters” in real life. Here’s what makes NPC special: every single coin is backed by an NFT of the meme itself. That means NPC isn’t just another token with a funny name—it’s connected to something you can actually own and show off. This makes NPC the first-ever memecoin-NFT hybrid! The total supply of NPC was set based on the global population when it launched on July 29, 2023. Why? Because NPC is for everyone—just like the meme. Their motto says it all: “I support the current coin.” Aiming for Total NPC Takeover NPC has a grand vision: to become the definitive memecoin of the internet. To achieve this, the team has made significant moves, including acquiring the npc.com domain in March 2024—a testament to their commitment to owning the narrative around this meme. Through their platform, app.npc.com, users can create their own unique NPCs in virtually endless ways. This feature reinforces the project’s mission to integrate creativity, personalization, and community building. The future of NPC includes ambitions for broader adoption of their groundbreaking tech. Their custom token standard, ERC11, makes it easy for others to launch their own memecoin-NFT hybrids. This innovation allows creators to tie coins to media like music, videos, or even games, potentially revolutionizing how blockchain connects with popular culture. Memecoins 2.0: The Future is Here In an ecosystem where memecoins often rely on hype, NPC delivers substance. By linking tokens to NFTs and introducing novel tech, NPC aims to push the boundaries of what memecoins can achieve. As the team puts it: “Ever since we launched over a year ago, we’ve always been shipping and building novel ways to advance the memecoin space forward.” NPC is a fusion of what’s familiar and what’s forward-thinking: a widely beloved meme paired with tech innovation that points to the next evolution of Web3 .

Popular crypto tracking platform Lookonchain called the public’s attention to the transactions today. https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1862074609442635857Transaction Details Data from Etherscan show that the first transfer occurred today around 07:58 a.m. (UTC). At the time, the whale withdrew a total of 149,999,653,570 (approximately 150 billion) PEPE, worth $2.94 million, from Binance in a single transaction. Binance deposited the funds in the whale’s newly created wallet through one of its wallets labeled ‘Binance 15.’ This withdrawal marks the wallet’s first transaction since its creation. A few minutes later, the whale made another hefty withdrawal from Binance. This time, the user withdrew approximately 60 billion Shiba Inu tokens, valued at $1.52 million, according to Lookonchain. The 60 billion SHIBs were deposited in three separate transactions, each containing approximately 20 billion tokens. Notably, the withdrawals emanated from Binance Wallets, such as Binance 14 and Binance 16. PEPE and SHIB Surge Amid Whale Accumulation The recent withdrawals from Binance suggest that the whale might be planning to hold the tokens for the long term. Currently, the tokens are still held in the wallet. While PEPE accounts for 65.92% of the portfolio, Shiba Inu represents 34%, with Ethereum (ETH) constituting 0.08%. Notably, such withdrawals could reduce the number of SHIB and PEPE on the world’s largest exchanges, potentially contributing positively to price action. The move coincides with a slight surge in the prices of both assets. While SHIB has surged 2.03% in 24 hours to $0.00002517, PEPE has soared 7.03% in the same timeframe to $0.00001944. Massive Whale Accumulation of SHIB and PEPE Meanwhile, crypto experts are betting on Shiba Inu and PEPE in the ongoing bull run, prompting whales to accumulate huge amounts of both tokens from exchanges. For instance, an unidentified whale took advantage of the mid-November dip to amass a whopping 4 trillion Shiba Inu tokens worth $99 million at the time. A few days later, crypto whales withdrew 1.67 trillion SHIB from exchanges, representing 0.28% of the total supply. Similarly, large investors also found PEPE enticing this month as they embarked on accumulation sprees for the token. On November 20, a big investor splashed $2 million worth of USDC to acquire PEPE in one transaction. This purchase follows other large transactions reported this month featuring the frog-themed token. Earlier this month, three whales acquired $7.94 million worth of PEPE, totaling 535.81 billion PEPE, from two prominent exchanges, Binance and Gate.io.",POSITIVE,SHIB | PEPE,EXCHANGE | MARKET | SHIB | BNB | PEPE,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/28/unknown-whale-withdraws-60b-shiba-inu-and-150b-pepe-from-binance-to-new-wallet/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=unknown-whale-withdraws-60b-shiba-inu-and-150b-pepe-from-binance-to-new-wallet,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

36957378,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=105295,1732804938,4 Solana-Based Gems That Could Rival DOGE and SHIB With Massive Returns!,"Meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have grabbed attention with huge profits. Now, a new set of Solana-based cryptocurrencies may offer similar potential. This article examines four little-known Solana tokens that could see significant growth. Discover these opportunities before they become mainstream. DOGEN: The First Memetoken for Alpha Males Who Demand the Best Unleash your inner alpha with DOGEN, the meme token built for those who want to live a beautiful life.

With DOGEN, you’re looking at potential thousand-fold returns as memetokens lead the hottest trend of this altcoin season. The earlier you jump in, the more you win! It’s a deal that others will envy, and you’ll be at the top of the pack. Missed WIF, Popcat or Ponke rise? DOGEN is the new doggie on the Solana memetokens ground alongside BONK, WIF, and Popcat known for their astonishing 1000% growth . Currently undervalued, DOGEN is poised to take this crypto narrative to the next level, potentially breaking records in this bull run. Community-Driven with Real Value DOGEN isn’t just a short-lived hype; it’s a growing movement . The team behind DOGEN is laser-focused on building a thriving community of alpha leaders who refuse to settle for less and are geared up to dominate the market.

Join the Dogen Army today and conquer the crypto world! Dogwifhat (WIF): A New Meme Coin on the Solana Blockchain Dogwifhat (WIF) is a new dog-themed meme coin gaining popularity on the Solana blockchain. Inspired by the viral Dogwifhat meme, it joins a growing list of meme coins derived from internet culture. These coins focus on community engagement and fun rather than traditional financial uses. WIF leverages Solana’s fast and scalable blockchain technology, which may enhance its transaction speed and efficiency. In the current market cycle, WIF’s rising popularity reflects interest in community-driven projects. Its presence on Solana distinguishes it from other meme coins on different blockchains. Understanding WIF’s place in the meme coin space and its use of Solana’s technology provides insight into its potential. BONK: Solana’s Community Memecoin with Shiba Inu Mascot BONK is a memecoin on the Solana blockchain featuring a Shiba Inu mascot. It aims to empower the Solana community by shifting influence away from venture capital tokens. In early 2023, BONK surged over 100% following its listing on Coinbase. As a “community coin,” it airdropped 50% of its supply to participants in Solana’s NFT and DeFi sectors. By mid-December 2023, BONK became the third-largest memecoin by market cap, showing significant growth within the Solana ecosystem. Despite challenges like its high total supply and the volatile nature of memecoins, BONK’s integration into decentralized applications like the BonkSwap exchange positions it as a notable cryptocurrency. Given these developments, BONK appears attractive in the current market cycle. MEW Coin: A Cat Among Dog-Themed Cryptocurrencies MEW Coin is a cryptocurrency that positions itself as a cat in a market dominated by dog-themed coins. It aims to offer an alternative by introducing unique features and technology. MEW seeks to stand out in the blockchain space by providing a fresh perspective. In the current market cycle, with investors exploring new opportunities, MEW Coin may appear attractive. Its potential relies on its ability to differentiate itself and gain adoption among users. Conclusion While WIF, BONK, and MEW show promise, they may offer less short-term potential. DOGEN stands out, designed for those seeking luxury and success. With expected 700% growth by end of presale and potential for massive returns, DOGEN is building a community of leaders, offering real benefits to early adopters.

Additionally, Bitstamp and LTP will continue to work together and “explore innovative solutions to enhance the digital asset trading ecosystem.” Bitstamp Secures MTF License Founded in 2011, Bitstamp is one of the world’s oldest cryptocurrency exchanges. In October this year, Bitstamp received a MiFID Multilateral Trading Facility (MTF) license from Slovenia’s Securities Market Agency. Under the license, Bitstamp is authorized to offer crypto derivatives like perpetual swaps and expand into trading stocks, commodities, bonds, and structured products. In June, Bitstamp was acquired by United States-based fintech Robinhood in a $200 million deal. The deal, expected to close in early 2025, seeks to expand Robinhood’s crypto offerings and global reach, particularly in Asia, the United Kingdom, and the European Union. We’re accelerating Robinhood Crypto’s worldwide expansion. Robinhood has officially entered into an agreement to acquire @Bitstamp , a global cryptocurrency exchange with customers across the EU, UK, US and Asia.

In May, the company received a Wells notice from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) alleging securities violations related to its crypto business. Traditional Finance Embraces Crypto As institutional investor interest in digital assets continues to grow, more traditional exchanges and brokers are launching crypto-related products to meet this demand. A prime example of this trend is the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group, which debuted its Bitcoin Friday Futures (BFF) in late September. The BFF experienced a record-breaking first day, with over 31,498 contracts traded across two contract weeks. On Nov. 25, MIAX Sapphire Options Exchange submitted revised rules to start listing options on three Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs): Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC), and Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB). The move follows similar listings by major exchanges such as Nasdaq, Cboe and NYSE, which are also expanding options trading for crypto ETFs.

36959089,https://cryptonews.com/?p=313625,1732804759,Celsius Announces Second Bankruptcy Payout of $127 Million to Creditors,"Celsius, a bankrupt crypto lender has announced a second payout of $127 million to its creditors. This bankruptcy distribution, which will be made in cash or cryptocurrency, will cover approximately 60% of the creditors’ claims. Celsius Bankruptcy Payout Details According to the recent court filing , creditors will receive the distribution based on the value of their claims as of the date of the petition. A significant part of the payout will be in cryptocurrency, with Bitcoin set to be valued at an average price of $95,836. The distribution will be made in cash for those who cannot receive cryptocurrency through the designated agents. Celsius will soon begin a second distribution of $127 million made available from the Litigation Recovery Account to eligible creditors (Classes 2, 5, 7, 8, and 9). Distributions will be made in BTC or USD, based on eligibility. For more details, please refer to this notice:… — Celsius (@CelsiusNetwork) November 27, 2024 This decision comes after the company’s first payout, which distributed $2 billion in crypto to over 171,000 creditors . The payment distribution marks another step in Celsius’s bankruptcy process as the company continues to navigate the challenges of its financial collapse. Celsius filed for bankruptcy in 2022 after a $1.2 billion gap was uncovered in its balance sheet, leading to a loss of trust and a significant drop in assets. BREAKING: Celsius Network confirms they’ve filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. — Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) July 14, 2022 Since then, the company has been working through its bankruptcy plan, offering partial recovery for creditors who were affected by the financial collapse. The second payout adds to the ongoing efforts to repay creditors and resolve the issues that led to Celsius’s downfall. CEO Faces Legal Trouble Amid Bankruptcy Amid the ongoing Celsius Bankruptcy proceedings, the company’s former CEO, Alex Mashinsky, is facing serious legal issues. Mashinsky has been accused of fraud and misleading customers about the company’s financial health, leading to a class-action lawsuit filed by several regulatory bodies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The charges against Mashinsky include allegations that he misled customers about the safety of their investments and the performance of the company’s crypto lending products. Mashinsky’s request to dismiss the fraud charges was rejected earlier this year. He faces a potential prison sentence of up to 115 years if convicted. The fraud charges have added another layer of complexity to the already contentious Celsius Bankruptcy process, as creditors are left to navigate the company’s legal troubles while trying to recover their funds. Legal experts are closely monitoring the case, as it could set a significant precedent for other crypto lending firms facing similar regulatory challenges. Since the bankruptcy filing, Celsius has been under intense scrutiny from both regulators and the public. In addition to the Celsius Bankruptcy, another crypto platform, Haru Invest, has also faced major financial fallout . The South Korean firm, which promised high returns on crypto deposits, was declared bankrupt after a $1 billion fraud was uncovered. When the platform halted withdrawals in June 2023, over 16,000 investors were affected. Haru Invest’s executives, including CEO Hugo Hyungsoo Lee, were arrested in connection with the fraud, and the company is now set to liquidate its assets in hopes of recovering some funds for its creditors.

36956954,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=655308,1732804230,Storm Ahead? Bitcoin Price Could Tumble 20% Due To M2 Supply Concerns,"Investors have expressed apprehension regarding the recent price fluctuations of Bitcoin, particularly in light of analysts’ predictions of a 20-25% decline in the global M2 money supply. At $92,864, bitcoin is down nearly 9% from its recent high of just under $100,000. That fall is part of a trend of profit-taking by long-term holders, who sold 366,000 BTC in the last month, the most since April 2024. Introduction To The M2 Money Supply Connection Market researchers have been studying the relationship between Bitcoin prices and global M2 money circulation. Crypto analyst Joe Consorti noted that Bitcoin prices have regularly tracked M2 pricing, albeit 70 days later. Bitcoin has tracked global M2 with a ~70-day lag since September 2023. I don’t want to alarm anyone, but if it continues, bitcoin could be in for a 20-25% correction. Global M2 in Bitcoin in pic.twitter.com/PlPoaHUoFR — Joe Consorti (@JoeConsorti) November 25, 2024 That is, Bitcoin’s price is likely to follow the trend of M2 going down in the near future. The latest drop in M2 shows that Bitcoin might fall to important support levels of $88,000 or even $80,000 if things keep going the way they are. UPDATE: One day after my last chart, bitcoin is now $5,000 lower, following the path set by global M2 several weeks ago very closely. So far, this correlation is shockingly accurate. We’ll have to see if BTC follows it all the way down, or stops short & finds support. pic.twitter.com/oEGOuYYRio — Joe Consorti (@JoeConsorti) November 26, 2024 Bitcoin has been weakening as it can’t stay over $94,000. Because breaking these liquidity zones could cause greater declines, analysts are watching them attentively. Investors are worried because Bitcoin’s chance of reaching $100,000 by year’s end has plummeted from 92% to 64%. Long-Term Holders’ Pressure To Sell Glassnode’s most recent data indicates that long-term holders (LTHs) have been more active in selling , with over 507,000 BTC distributed since September 2023. This selling pressure is substantial and indicates that numerous investors are liquidating their profits in the context of the current market volatility. The potential shift in market sentiment, which is suggested by the increased activity among LTHs, could further exacerbate the downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price. Additionally, the Realized Profit/Loss (P/L) ratio has reached new historical highs, indicating an overheated market. An increase in this ratio typically means that a sizable portion of investors are benefiting from price increases. Analysts caution that Bitcoin’s rising momentum may be waning due to the current trend of profit-taking and decreasing liquidity. Bitcoin Future Outlook – What Is In Store? As it works its way through these challenges, the future of Bitcoin is still quite foggy. Despite the fact that there are market observers who believe that the price of the top crypto can normalize at lower levels, there are also analysts who warn that additional corrections might be required if global liquidity continues to decrease.

36957502,https://blockworks.co/news/parafi-2030-predictions-rwas,1732804200,ParaFi makes 2 big predictions for 2030,"This is a segment from the Empire newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . The holidays are the perfect time to reminisce on the year that was and, of course, look ahead to the next six years. I mean, how else do you survive your turkey coma? Speaking of predictions for 2030, ParaFi had some fascinating callouts in the most recent episode of the Empire podcast. Two stood out to me, and I wanted to talk more about them so get comfortable in your stretchy pants. The first was that tokenized real-world assets will outpace the overall value of digital assets. Excluding stablecoins, total RWA value has topped nearly $13.5 billion. Total RWA value per rwa.xyz The total crypto market cap right now sits around $3.4 trillion, so RWA’s not ready to eat cryptos lunch just yet but, as ParaFi’s Ben Forman pointed out, we’ve seen RWAs jump in value, growing way over 50% in the past 12 months alone. The financial sector — stop me if you’ve heard this one before — is outdated. “We still don’t have … an Amazon experience for finance,” Forman said. So the opportunity to revamp the financial systems is ripe for the picking. “The beauty of tokenization is that when you have assets on a blockchain, you can program logic into the actual asset itself. This reduces the need for lawyers for administrators for trustees, and it also opens up a whole host of other AI agent use cases where micro payments can be enabled,” Forman said. Right now, the biggest winners in the space are tokenized treasuries, which make up 62% of the whole pie. But you can’t talk about RWA tokenization without also addressing stablecoins. If you combine the two, according to rwa.xyz, you get a combined market cap of nearly $200 billion. ParaFi thinks that, by 2030, we could see the stablecoin supply reach 10% of M2 money supply in the US. Similarly to their RWA prediction, there’s a way to go for stablecoins until they hit 10%. Right now, they barely make up 1% with M2 coming in at $21 trillion. There are three reasons for ParaFi’s thinking here: Stablecoins have evolved as a new form of payment rails across the world. Then you have the potential for fintech companies to add in stablecoins because they’re not burdened by the legacy operating systems of older firms. So there’s potential to see a new business model of yield-bearing reserves to back stablecoins, ParaFi’s Kevin Yedid-Botton noted. Source: Delphi Digital A Delphi Digital report from earlier this week found that weekly stablecoin transfer volume is at 302 billion, an increase of 235% year-to-date. “Stablecoins have found product-market fit and are enabling a more global digital economy,” the report said. It’s hard not to be bullish about these two predictions. Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. Subscribe to the Empire newsletter .

36958810,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=103191,1732804111,Top Analyst Says Shiba Inu Ready to Break Above Weekly Ichimoku Cloud: Here are Targets to Watch,"Shiba Inu (SHIB) is capturing the crypto market's attention as its weekly chart reveals a potential bullish breakout above the Ichimoku cloud. In recent weeks, the price of Shiba Inu has been discouraging, lagging behind its peers in the meme coin market. SHIB is currently trading at $0.00002531, recording only 35% gains in the last four weeks. Meanwhile, Dogecoin has surged by 143% during the same period, while PEPE has seen an impressive 105% monthly gain despite trading 22% below its most recent all-time high.Notably, Dogecoin has been trading at price levels that were last seen during the peak of the previous bull season. Shiba Inu, however, is still working to recover from its eight-month-long downtrend. Nonetheless, analysts are watching for indicators that suggest a significant move for SHIB is imminent.Shiba Inu Ready to Break Ichimoku CloudTechnical analyst Cantonese Cat believes SHIB is on the verge of breaking above the weekly Ichimoku Cloud, which could signal the start of a strong uptrend after its prolonged period of lackluster price action.The Ichimoku Cloud represents critical resistance and support zones. Shiba Inu hovers near the cloud's upper boundary, a level traders consider a key inflection point. A decisive close above the cloud on the weekly timeframe could confirm bullish sentiment, potentially attracting fresh buyers and driving the price toward higher levels.Potential SHIB TargetsShould the breakout occur, the analysis identifies $0.00003100 as the immediate resistance level for Shiba Inu to overcome. Successfully reclaiming this level could set the stage for a move toward the $0.000037 region, last seen in March. Beyond that, Shiba Inu may target its yearly high of $0.000045 and potentially reclaim previous peaks from 2021, preparing it to finally push for an all-time high. Shiba Inu chart by Cantonese Cat Other Bullish Forecast for SHIBOther analysts have also shared optimistic views on Shiba Inu based on different technical indicators.The analyst behind the InvestingHaven platform recently pointed out that a price of $0.0000555 remains attainable for Shiba Inu before the end of the year, citing Fibonacci retracement levels. Meanwhile, data analyst ""CW"" suggests that Shiba Inu is forming a triangle convergence with its eight-month-long downtrend. According to him, a breakout above this pattern could propel SHIB to an all-time high of $0.00038.",POSITIVE,SHIB | PEPE,DOGE | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING | PEPE,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/28/top-analyst-says-shiba-inu-ready-to-break-above-weekly-ichimoku-cloud-here-are-targets-to-watch/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=top-analyst-says-shiba-inu-ready-to-break-above-weekly-ichimoku-cloud-here-are-targets-to-watch,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png
36956940,https://crypto.news/?p=14314700,1732804104,LUNC price could soar as Terra Luna burns 1.34b tokens,"Terra Luna Classic price has risen gradually after bottoming in August, and analysts are optimistic that it has more upside. Terra Luna Classic ( LUNC ), the remnant of the collapsed Terra network, climbed to $0.000129 this week, marking its highest point since March this year. Some crypto analysts believe the token has more room to grow, especially if the crypto bull run gains momentum. In a recent post, Miles Deutscher, a popular analyst on X, noted that he was long LUNA and LUNC. He cited reasons such as LUNC’s continued listing on Binance, strong bullish charts, and its meme appeal. https://twitter.com/milesdeutscher/status/1860399178691805254 Another potential catalyst for Terra Luna Classic is the ongoing token burn, reducing supply and increasing the value of the remaining tokens. According to LUNC Metrics, the network burned 1.34 billion tokens in the last seven days. You might also like: Top analyst explains why Ethereum price could hit $10,000 The network has now burned over 390 billion tokens, leaving a circulating supply of 6.51 trillion. A significant burn occurred earlier this month when Terraform Labs burned 251 billion tokens as part of a bankruptcy requirement. The LUNC staking ratio has also risen from its 2022 lows, now approaching 16%, indicating that many investors are holding onto the token for the long term. LUNC price chart points to more gains LUNC chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart indicates that Terra Luna Classic has been on a slow bullish trend after bottoming at $0.000054 a few months ago. It has formed a cup and handle pattern, with the upper side at $0.000129, a pattern known for signaling bullish continuation. Based on the depth of the cup, the coin could rise to $0.0002055, approximately 75% above its current level. This target is slightly above the 38.2% Fibonacci Retracement level at $0.00020. Further supporting the bullish outlook is LUNC’s movement above the 50-day and 100-day moving averages. The Relative Strength Index is also climbing, reflecting sustained bullish momentum. However, a drop below the 100-day moving average at $0.000095 would invalidate the bullish view.

The DeFi Spring program and diverse protocol participation have driven a 300% quarterly TVL increase. Starknet’s stablecoin market grew 64.1% QoQ, with USDC and USDT dominating over 98% of liquidity. Starknet, an Ethereum Layer 2 scaling solution, has experienced impressive growth so far in 2024, according to a report from blockchain analytics platform Messari. The network’s total value locked (TVL) has surged by 550% year-to-date, reaching $252 million, largely driven by the public launch of the STRK token in February 2024. Starknet’s ecosystem also is expanding across DeFi, gaming, and infrastructure. One of the standout initiatives propelling this growth is the DeFi Spring program, which was designed to incentivize participation across Starknet’s decentralized finance protocols. The first phase of DeFi Spring distributed 40 million STRK tokens between February and October 2024, resulting in a 300% quarterly TVL increase in Q1 2024.

The Advisory Committee on Business Appointments granted former British politician Steve Baker approval to take up a paid advisory role at Axiom Venture Capital after he underwent a background assessment. According to a government document issued on Nov. 28, Baker had sought approval from the advisory board before officially joining up with the Bitcoin ( BTC )-focused firm. Baker was allowed to accept the job as an adviser to Axiom as long as he followed certain conditions laid out in the document, namely that he was not allowed to divulge government secrets or information from his time as minister that could potentially benefit the firm. Baker served as the minister of state at the Northern Ireland Office from 2022 until 2024. An internal assessment by the ACOBA did not find any prior engagements Baker was involved in during his tenure as minister that could benefit Axiom or damage “the integrity of the government.” You might also like: U.K. FCA will finalize crypto industry regulations in 2026: report “It is an applicant’s personal responsibility to manage the propriety of any appointment.

The 7 Principles of Public Life consist of selflessness, integrity, objectivity, accountability, openness, honesty, and leadership. Within the document, the committee outlined certain risks that could come up regarding his previous influence in the government and his role in Axiom that could enable the firm to “gain unfair access or influence as a result.” Therefore, the committee advised Baker to mitigate any potential risks that could arise, including the misuse of contacts and influence within and outside the government. He is also banned from lobbying the UK government for Axiom for two years. Moreover, Baker is not allowed to advise Axiom on areas he oversaw as a minister or lobby contacts he made in the U.K. government for at least two years. In an X post , Baker announced that he will be joining Axiom Venture Capital as a part-time adviser for its second venture fund, Axiom Venture Fund II.

This outlook aligns with the Thanksgiving holiday season, which has historically been a foundation for Bitcoin to record price breakouts. To this end, the maiden digital asset has formed a narrowing wedge pattern—a technical setup characterized by converging trendlines that indicate a potential breakout. This pattern places the $99,000 target in sight, according to an analysis by on-chain analyst Ali Martinez in an X post on November 28. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView/Ali_charts Bitcoin’s bounce from key Fibonacci retracement levels around the $94,000 zone further supports this optimism. These levels often act as crucial areas of support or resistance, reflecting renewed buying interest and the likelihood of trend continuation. Bitcoin avoids ‘Thanksgiving massacre’ Leading up to this year’s Thanksgiving, Bitcoin’s bullish run from the post-election rally positioned it to target $100,000. However, this move appeared invalidated at some point as the maiden cryptocurrency faced the threat of dropping below $90,000 .

The platform observed that Thanksgiving week once again delivered a familiar Bitcoin dip, with prices down 8% in 2024—less severe than 2020’s 17% plunge, which preceded a massive 280% rally. In this case, if Bitcoin replicates its historical performance, the analyst suggested it could target $120,000 as the next high, although no specific timeline was provided. Should Bitcoin reach this target, it would add approximately $480 billion to its market cap, bringing the total to around $2.35 trillion. Bitcoin price performance on Thanksgiving 2020 and 2024.

With its robust blockchain technology and innovative smart contracts, Ethereum isn't just a digital currency—it's a platform for change. I've witnessed its growth and the potential it holds for transforming industries, from finance to supply chain management. Investing in Ethereum feels like being part of a technological revolution. Its dynamic ecosystem and continuous upgrades, like the transition to Ethereum 2.0, aim to enhance scalability and security. This evolution excites me, as it suggests a promising future for investors seeking to capitalise on cutting-edge advancements. The potential returns on Ethereum investments can be compelling. While the crypto market's volatility is undeniable, the long-term outlook for Ethereum remains positive. By staying informed and understanding the trends, I find myself optimistic about the opportunities Ethereum presents in shaping the future of digital finance. Key Takeaways Ethereum's Transformative Potential: Ethereum's robust blockchain technology and smart contracts position it as a major player in industries such as finance and supply chain management, making it more than just a cryptocurrency. Investment Outlook and Opportunities: While the crypto market is volatile, Ethereum's ongoing enhancements, like the shift to Ethereum 2.0, suggest promising long-term growth, providing substantial opportunities for investors. Key Influencing Factors: Technological advancements and regulatory frameworks are significant factors influencing Ethereum's market performance, requiring investors to stay informed. Risks and Challenges: Investment in Ethereum involves volatility and security concerns, necessitating vigilant risk management strategies to navigate potential pitfalls. Diverse Investment Strategies: Ethereum allows for varied investment strategies, catering to both long-term holders focused on fundamental growth and short-term traders capitalising on market fluctuations. Future Prospects with Smart Contracts and DeFi: Ethereum's role in decentralised finance and growing institutional adoption underscore its expanding use cases, attracting a broad spectrum of investors. Understanding Ethereum Investment Outlook Exploring Ethereum investment offers insights into its potential and dynamic nature. I find the blockchain's innovations, particularly smart contracts, fascinating, shaping industries. Definition of Ethereum Investment Ethereum investment involves buying its native cryptocurrency, ETH. The Ethereum blockchain powers smart contracts and dApps. Investing means purchasing ETH with hopes of profit. Returns can come from price climbs, staking rewards, or engagement with dApps. An Ethereum investment offers avenues beyond simple trading, tapping into a vast ecosystem. I view it as both a speculative and innovative venture into blockchain's capabilities. Understanding this can influence investment decisions and strategies. Importance of Analysing Investment Outlook Evaluating Ethereum's investment outlook is vital. It helps predict price changes and growth potential. Market trends and predictions for 2024 indicate significant price movement. Some forecasts suggest Ethereum could hit $3,000 by year's end. Analysing the market prepares me to navigate volatility. I think staying informed can optimise investment choices and open opportunities in digital finance. Regular analysis enhances my confidence in making strategic choices in the dynamic crypto landscape. Examining Market Trends for Ethereum Ethereum's market trends in these times offer exciting insights. I find both its historical journey and current developments to be ripe with opportunities. Historical Price Performance Ethereum's journey began with a modest value, experiencing rapid growth by 2017. Its price skyrocketed, peaking at over $1,400. By early 2021, it hit an all-time high above $4,200. These fluctuations, while unpredictable, signify strong interest and adaptability. I see this historical rise as a testament to the platform's resilience. This resilient trajectory encourages my confidence in its long-term potential. As ETH matured, its value saw both highs and lows. Yet, there's a lesson in every dip and peak, driving strategic investment. Recent Market Developments Recent developments paint a complex picture. Ethereum's transition to a proof-of-stake model is crucial. This upgrade promises scalability and reduced energy use. With its value fluctuating between $2,199 and $3,019, I see adaptive strategies as key. Market trends show potential spikes and falls, especially with upcoming Ethereum 2.0 improvements. Regulatory news also influences market dynamics. Staying updated ensures I seize favourable opportunities. The community's strong ethic fuels innovation, reinforcing Ethereum's competitive edge. Identifying Key Factors Influencing Ethereum Ethereum's dynamic landscape presents intriguing investment opportunities. I've observed that several factors, mainly technological and regulatory aspects, play critical roles in shaping its future. Technological Advancements Ethereum's upgrades like the Pectra uplift the network. These advancements boost scalability and security. I see sharding and layer 2 protocols bravely tackle transaction congestion. Such solutions promise lower costs and increased efficiency. Cross-chain interoperability initiatives excite me as they expand Ethereum's use and reach. Regulatory Environment The regulatory landscape shapes Ethereum's market position. I've noticed regulations evolve, affecting accessibility. Positive regulations ensure stability and growth. However, constant vigilance is required. Understanding the global regulatory impact helps me make informed decisions on Ethereum investments. The environment often directs Ethereum's adaptability and resilience. Exploring Risks and Challenges Investing in Ethereum can be rewarding but isn't without its share of challenges. Understanding these challenges helps me make informed investment decisions. Volatility Concerns Ethereum's wild price swings often leave me on edge. I remember the drop to $2,100 during a crash and its bounce back. Predictions differ greatly—from $2,199 to $3,019 for 2024. Such fluctuations keep me alert and ready for quick decisions. I rely on tools like the Fear & Greed Index, although they're not foolproof. Security Issues Security is critical when investing in Ethereum. I know incidents like DeFi hacks and protocol exploits pose risks. Keeping my wallet safe is essential. Strong passwords and new security measures give me peace of mind. The network also benefits from security upgrades, ensuring transactions are safer. These steps make me confident in Ethereum's resilience. Considering Opportunities for Investors Ethereum presents intriguing opportunities for investors. Its diverse ecosystem invites participation in innovative financial models. Smart Contracts and Decentralised Finance I find Ethereum's smart contracts truly transformative. They automate agreements, reducing the need for intermediaries. In decentralised finance (DeFi), they power applications like lending platforms and exchanges, creating new possibilities. The transparency and security they offer are revolutionary. I witnessed a friend's significant gains through DeFi lending. It opened my eyes to the potential returns. Ethereum's role in DeFi continues to expand, attracting more investors. The growth in this area seems unstoppable, offering diverse options for those willing to explore. Institutional Adoption I see more institutions embracing Ethereum. It's gaining traction as a credible asset. Banks and financial giants are investing in Ethereum, validating its potential. I spoke with a banker who expressed confidence in its future. This alignment reassured me about Ethereum's viability. With mainstream endorsements, Ethereum's legitimacy has strengthened. Institutional interest drives significant capital into the ecosystem, boosting growth. It encourages me to consider long-term strategies. Watching these developments unfold is thrilling, and I'm eager to see how it shapes the market. Strategies for Investing in Ethereum Ethereum presents a variety of investment strategies, tailored to different goals and risk levels. This flexibility is part of what makes Ethereum an appealing choice for investors like me. Long-term vs. Short-term Investment When I think about long-term investment, I focus on Ethereum's fundamentals. Its solid transaction volume and role in DeFi are promising. I believe in its potential growth if it retains market dominance. In contrast, short-term trading is all about capitalising on volatility. I keep close tabs on price fluctuations to make quick buy-sell decisions. While it's riskier, the rewards can be intriguing if done carefully. Diversification and Risk Management Diversification is key in managing risks. I don't put all my funds in Ethereum. Instead, I spread my investments across different assets like Bitcoin, Litecoin, and stocks. This helps reduce exposure to any single market downturn. I also set stop-loss orders to minimise losses in volatile times. Trusting only a few cryptos doesn't align with my risk strategy. Keeping an eye on the regulatory news helps me adapt swiftly, guiding my risk management decisions efficiently. Conclusion Ethereum's investment landscape is both promising and complex. With its transformative technology and continuous upgrades, Ethereum stands as a beacon of innovation in the crypto world. While volatility remains a challenge, the potential for growth and profit is substantial. Staying informed and adaptable is crucial in navigating this dynamic environment. By leveraging Ethereum's vast ecosystem and employing strategic investment approaches, I believe investors can position themselves for success in the ever-evolving digital finance arena.

The world of earning money has gotten… undeniably adorable. Telegram, once just a place for quick chats and memes, now boasts a thriving ecosystem of tap-to-earn games. These aren't your grandma's solitaire; they're games where each tap translates into real cryptocurrency, creating a surprisingly addictive mix of casual gameplay and genuine earning potential. But with a plethora of pixelated creatures vying for your attention, how do you choose the perfect tap-to-earn adventure? Fear not, clicker heroes! We've plunged into the pixelated depths and emerged, slightly dazed but armed with a definitive ranking of five fantastic contenders. Crystal Kami: The Cosmic Clicker Champion Crystal Kami is the rising star of the tap-to-earn universe. This isn't just mindless tapping; it's a journey. A truly charming story unfolds, guided by adorable cosmic companions – a mischievous mind cat and a loyal, steadfast dog. The gameplay is refreshingly simple yet intensely addictive, seamlessly blending fun and rewarding earning potential. The developers deserve immense praise for their proactive community management; they're actively listening to feedback, squashing bugs, and constantly striving for improvement. The game's rapid growth, surpassing 170,000 players in a flash, speaks volumes about its captivating appeal and undeniable long-term potential. The cleverly implemented referral program is just the cherry on top of this cosmic clicker cake! What sets it apart: A charming art style, an engaging narrative, stellar community management, and a perfect balance between fun gameplay and tangible rewards. It's clear the developers are deeply invested in the game's success and their players' experience. Perspective: Crystal Kami possesses incredible potential for long-term success. The engaging gameplay, strong community, and developers' dedication to consistent updates make it a standout in the increasingly crowded tap-to-earn market. Battle Bulls: A Versatile Powerhouse in Play-to-Earn Battle Bulls is a captivating play-to-earn game that seamlessly blends simple, engaging core gameplay with a layer of sophisticated strategic depth. Players nurture their virtual bull through intuitive tap-based interactions, building a thriving in-game business that directly mirrors their progress on the blockchain. Strategic decisions are paramount to maximizing profits and climbing the competitive leaderboard. A unique card system generates passive income even while offline, complementing the active gameplay. The game utilizes the BULL token, which boasts real-world utility thanks to innovative ""splitting technology"" allowing for daily rewards from staking. What sets it apart: • Strategic depth & blockchain integration: Your in-game success directly translates to your virtual blockchain business, demanding strategic planning for maximum profit generation• Transparent roadmap & token liquidity: The BULL token is listed on reputable exchanges (BingX, Coinstore), and a clear roadmap outlines future developments including a second airdrop in February 2025.• Large & engaged community: Benefit from the support and interaction of a community exceeding 10,000,000 members. Perspective: Battle Bulls presents a compelling opportunity in the play-to-earn landscape. Its blend of accessible gameplay and strategic complexity, combined with the utility of the BULL token and a demonstrably committed development team, points to strong potential for long-term growth and player engagement. Notcoin: The OG Tap-to-Earn Titan Notcoin isn't a newbie; it's a seasoned veteran, a true pioneer in the tap-to-earn arena, having successfully amassed over 35 million players. It's a testament to the simplicity and irresistible appeal of its core mechanics. But Notcoin isn't resting on its laurels. A successful token launch and strategic partnerships (like the collaboration with Lost Dogs) demonstrate its remarkable ability to adapt and expand. Its audacious ambition to become the ""Netflix of social, viral games"" highlights its potential for long-term growth. However, maintaining that momentum and delivering on its promise of continuous innovation is key to its continued reign. What sets it apart: Its proven track record, successful token launch, and ambitious plans for expanding its game ecosystem. Its established presence is a major advantage. Perspective: A serious contender with a history of success, but continued innovation and expansion are crucial to staying ahead in this dynamic landscape. Catizen: Merge, Meow, and Multiply Your Crypto If adorable hamsters weren't enough, Catizen delivers a purrfect dose of feline charm to the tap-to-earn scene. This Web3 game revolves around raising, merging, and showering your virtual cats with love to earn vKITTY, eventually convertible to CATI tokens. The September launch and airdrop generated considerable buzz, attracting over 34 million players. Maintaining this engagement post-airdrop is crucial, though. Will the developers manage to keep the adorable chaos captivating in the long run, or will it fade into obscurity? Their ability to evolve the gameplay and keep things fresh will determine its fate. What sets it apart: The undeniably charming cat theme – who can resist adorable digital kittens? The merging mechanic adds a layer of strategic depth. Perspective: Strong potential for initial gains, but sustained success depends on introducing innovative gameplay and fostering a thriving community. It’s got the charm; it needs the endurance. xKuCoin Bot: Where Fun Meets Finance (In Telegram!) xKuCoin isn't just another tap-to-earn game; it's a fun introduction to the exciting world of crypto trading, all conveniently packaged within your Telegram app. Built on the TON blockchain, this mini-app lets you earn Frog Points by tapping a cartoon frog. The brilliance lies in its seamless integration with the KuCoin exchange. You can buy, sell, and manage your crypto directly within Telegram, making it incredibly accessible, even for crypto newcomers. The developers have ambitious plans to expand the game with interactive features like real-time trading signals and potential cryptocurrency conversions of those hard-earned Frog Points. What sets it apart: The unique integration of crypto trading directly into the game. It's both educational and entertaining, offering a smooth entry point for those exploring cryptocurrency. Perspective: Strong potential for growth, especially as it expands its features and solidifies its position as a user-friendly bridge between casual gaming and active crypto trading. It's more than a game; it’s a learning tool. Hamster Kombat: Cuteness Overload with Algorithmic Undertones Let's be honest, the sheer cuteness of Hamster Kombat is a huge selling point. These aren't your average rodents; they're fluffy, twitchy-nosed hamsters running their own miniature crypto exchanges! The gameplay is delightfully simple: tap, tap, tap your way to accumulating HMSTR tokens. The initial token launch had a few bumps (delays happen, even in the crypto world!), but its massive player base – over 300 MILLION! – is impressive. The September airdrop was a significant event, rewarding some players handsomely but mostly, leaving them disappointed by the small sums they received. However, the long-term success of this adorable economic empire hinges on its ability to evolve beyond the basic tapping mechanic and build a truly engaging, sustainable ecosystem. What sets it apart: The sheer, overwhelming cuteness. Plus, managing a (virtual) crypto exchange adds a surprisingly addictive strategic element Perspective: High initial potential, but long-term success is a gamble depending on its ability to innovate and offer more than just mindless tapping. It's cute, but can it be clever? A Final Word of Caution (and Excitement!) The cryptocurrency world is inherently volatile. These games offer an exciting opportunity to earn while having fun, but they are not without risk. Always conduct thorough research before investing your time and effort. This ranking is based on our observations and analysis and should not be considered financial advice.

Data from Spotonchain confirmed the transaction, which happened by 12:59 (UTC) today. Notably, ""0xa7ef,"" the wallet address belonging to the co-founder, moved 20,000 ETH to a deposit wallet tied to Kraken.At the time of the transfer, the Ethereum tokens were worth $72.5 million, moved at an average price of around $3,627.

However, its bullish momentum has lost steam, spurred by selling pressure and a broader market correction.Nonetheless, analysts still expect Ethereum to appreciate substantially in the long term.

36956082,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=372666,1732802663,Big Ripple (XRP) Announcement Soon? Company Burns Millions of RLUSD Tokens,"TL;DR Ripple’s stablecoin is reportedly ready for launch, pending NYDFS approval. XRP remains strong, boosted by political shifts and anticipation of RLUSD’s release, currently trading at $1.46 with further potential upside. Is It Launch Time? Ripple took center stage in April this year, displaying its plans to introduce a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the American dollar. Over the past several months, the team disclosed that the product’s name will be RLUSD and will be available on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) and Ethereum. Towards the end of the summer, Ripple began testing the stablecoin, alerting users that purchasing and trading will be open once it received the necessary regulatory approval. The team minted and burned a vast amount of RLUSD during the testing phase. Most recently, X user Vet claimed that almost all stablecoins have been burned . “On each Ethereum and XRP Ledger, there is only around 100k RLUSD left,” they added. The announcement triggered speculation that the product’s launch might be just around the corner . However, Vet reminded that RLUSD will see the light of day once the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) gives the green light. Earlier this month, Monica Long (Ripple’s president) said the team is “operationally ready” to launch the product. However, she also maintained that the development is in the hands of the NYDFS. “It’s up to them. They are reviewing our trust application. It’s going to be in their hands when they are approving it.” XRP Price Outlook Some analysts have previously suggested that the further advancement of RLUSD and its eventual launch could positively impact XRP’s price. Ripple’s native token has spiked by 3% on a 24-hour scale, currently trading at around $1.46 (per CoinGecko’s data). It remains one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies in the last month following Donald Trump’s win in the US presidential elections and Gary Gensler’s (the Chairman of the US SEC) confirmation to vacate his post in January 2025. XRP Price, Source: CoinGecko Gensler is known for his anti-crypto stance, and the agency has filed countless lawsuits against cryptocurrency businesses during his tenure. Perhaps the most popular is the legal battle against Ripple . The XRP army now expects a faster and potentially favorable resolution under Gensler’s successor, who , according to some reports , might have a totally different approach to the digital asset sector.

Several whales have placed big buy orders for the token in recent days, with ETH also up by 37% in a month and 78% in a year. This has enabled Ethereum to outperform Bitcoin in the past week, and with ETH’s annual gains still distinctly below averages for major tokens, it could witness further acceleration in the coming months. Whales Move to Ethereum As ETH Up 15% in 7 Days, Outperforms BTC Analysts are beginning to notice that, after a few weeks of relative underperformance, Ethereum is beginning to show up to the ongoing bull market. After just three weeks, #Ethereum $ETH has shown growth of over 30% as it transitions from the ""Manipulation"" phase into the ""Distribution"" phase. Altcoins are following suit, as expected. https://t.co/j38uWJS09O pic.twitter.com/Z00X588hj2 — ฿LUE WHALΞ (@BTCBlueWhale) November 28, 2024 After falling to a one-month low of $2,373 on the day of the US election, ETH has actually risen by 51%. By contrast, Bitcoin – which has gained most of the attention following the election – is up by 40% from its price on November 5. The key difference between the two tokens is that Bitcoin has set new record highs in recent days and weeks, while Ethereum remains down by 26% on its ATH (set in November 2021). As such, Ethereum is still in an undervalued position, which means it’s arguably a better trading prospect than BTC right now. Many whales seem to agree with this view, at least when looking at recent transfer data . 8,389 #ETH (30,399,575 USD) transferred from #Binance to unknown wallet https://t.co/kjCWyKtgDH — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) November 28, 2024 Indeed, ETH’s 24-hour trading volume is currently at $46 billion, representing a more than 400% increase over where it was only a couple of days before the US election. This signals very high demand for the altcoin, with its chart today showing some strong momentum. In particular, its RSI (purple) remains close to 70, signalling sustained buying pressure. Source: TradingView It’s a similar story with its 30-period moving average (orange), which has been well above the 200-period average (blue) for a couple of weeks now. Normally, these high levels would signal overbuying, yet ETH had been in an oversold and undervalued position for so long that it can sustain some further gains. While it may dip a little in the next few days, it’s likely to reach $4,000 by late December. Outperforming the Market with New Presale Tokens While ETH has been outperforming BTC in recent weeks, traders may be able to outperform both coins by looking at smaller cap alternatives, including presale tokens. Such tokens can perform well when they list for the first time, with their sales generating enough momentum to cause big opening rallies.

The partnership with IDEMIA Secure Transactions brings its extensive connections and expertise in payment and connectivity solutions, with 1,900 financial institutions and FinTechs clients worldwide, together with Serenity’s knowledge in blockchain technology. The biometric card aims to meet the rising global demand for secure, scalable data management solutions for industries and individuals managing complex digital assets, and will be rolled out globally before the end of the year. This collaboration made it possible for Serenity to launch the sAxess biometric card, bringing a unique hybrid approach to security and combining Serenity’s blockchain technology with IDEMIA Secure Transactions’ expertise in advanced biometric smart cards. Unlike traditional PINs or passwords, sAxess utilizes fingerprint authentication and other biometrics to ensure that only authorized individuals can access sensitive data. Its security is further bolstered by the fact it relies on IST’s B.CHAIN hardware wallet, a solution backed by state-of-the-art smart card security and biometrics to offer a robust crypto cold storage solution and advanced secure authentication – meaning users can manage and access their digital assets directly. Its self-custody approach reduces the need for intermediaries, offering control and reduced exposure to third-party risks. sAxess includes Serenity’s patent-pending data recovery technology, offering secure pathways for data access under predefined conditions. The solution utilizes non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as secure credentials within a “digital safe,” providing a decentralized, immutable method for storing and recovering critical information. Furthermore, this allows users to set specific conditions, such as inheritance, for authorized data access. This goes beyond current methods of managing sensitive information for individuals and organizations, ensuring data recovery without compromising privacy. “We are looking to a new era in data security, with increasingly complex and frequent digital threats targeting individuals and organizations of all sizes,” said Venket Naga, CEO of Serenity. “This partnership with IDEMIA Secure Transactions goes beyond technology; it’s about creating trust during a time when breaches to sensitive data are becoming more potent and costly. By merging cutting-edge biometric capabilities with our revolutionary blockchain solutions, we are ensuring that individuals and businesses can access and manage their sensitive data with unprecedented security and ease.” “The launch of sAxess represents a seismic shift in how we approach data security and digital asset management,” said Farsh Fallah, COO of Serenity. “Spending years in the heart of the tech industry, it’s clear to me how innovation can transform industries – and sAxess is a pivotal step forward in the evolution in data security. It offers something that goes beyond encryption alone, empowering users to take control of their digital assets.” Amidst rising regulatory pressures such as GDPR and high-profile breaches affecting millions globally, companies are searching for reliable solutions for data protection. Designed with scalability needed to serve organizations within sectors such as banking, healthcare, and insurance, sAxess meets the complex demands of these industries, providing an adaptable solution for environments handling sensitive data. “We, at IDEMIA Secure Transactions, are delighted to be supporting Serenity in redefining the future of data and digital asset security,” said Jerome Ajdenbaum, VP Digital Currencies at IDEMIA Secure Transactions. “By leveraging our cutting-edge hardware wallet in a biometric card, Serenity sets a new standard in trust, security, and user experience, empowering users protecting data online, as well as crypto owners. In a market that prioritizes security and everyday convenience, sAxess delivers an intuitive yet innovative solution, bringing secure data and digital assets management right to users’ fingertips.” The sAxess card is the first of several innovations Serenity intends to introduce, building on the release of their storage solution, sBox, and with additional products like sVault and sWallet currently in development.

Data compiled from Dune Analytics shows that Uniswap recorded $38 billion in trading activity across major L2 networks, including Base, Arbitrum, Polygon, and Optimism. The November total exceeded its previous high, set in March, by $4 billion. Uniswap Labs noted , “Onchain history is being made. New all-time high for monthly L2 volume on the Uniswap Protocol.” With $19.5 billion in monthly trading volume, Arbitrum topped Uniswap’s charts, followed by Coinbase-incubated Base network at $13 billion. Uniswap’s growing activity on Ethereum Layer 2s can be attributed to the broader DeFi sector’s increasing appetite for assets and stablecoins. Arthur Cheong, the founder of Defiance Capital drew a parallel between the ongoing DeFi Renaissance and the transformative European Renaissance, emphasizing its potential to redefine global finance. Just as the European Renaissance marked a cultural and intellectual awakening, the DeFi movement is reshaping traditional finance by leveraging blockchain technology and smart contracts, Cheong said in his latest post on X. The executive said that DeFi democratizes access to financial services, eliminates inefficiencies, and offers a trustless, 24/7 financial ecosystem. After overcoming the “trough of disillusionment,” the sector is now entering a phase of growth, driven by improved infrastructure, regulatory clarity, and macroeconomic factors like declining interest rates. With improvements in user experience, security, and emerging trends like liquid staking and restaking, DeFi is maturing into a scalable and efficient alternative to traditional financial systems. Cheong further added that this evolution is not merely a trend but a seismic shift in the financial landscape.

Dogecoin ( DOGE ) traded at $0.40 on Nov. 28, marking a 365% increase from its September low. This price action mirrored that of Bitcoin ( BTC ), which approached $100,000, setting a new record. Historically, Dogecoin and Bitcoin prices have moved in tandem. Data from IntoTheBlock reveals a correlation coefficient of 0.98 between the two, indicating similar price movements. Therefore, there is a likelihood that Dogecoin will continue its strong bull run when Bitcoin crosses $100,000. In a recent Bitcoin analysis , we noted that technicals pointed to an eventual jump to $122,000. This view is based on the coin’s cup and handle pattern on the weekly chart.

The company's aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy is a key highlight, positioning it as a unique investment vehicle. MicroStrategy is set to benefit from the influx of copycats. While MicroStrategy's long-term prospects are strong, it is still an incredibly risky investment as a result of its dependence on Bitcoin. MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) has emerged as a pioneering force in the ever-evolving landscape of corporate finance. Under the leadership of Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy has transformed from a little-known business intelligence software provider to what has been coined a ""Bitcoin Treasury Company."" With nearly 300,000 Bitcoin on its balance sheet with its latest Bitcoin purchase , MicroStrategy is certainly living up to its reputation as a pioneering force in the crypto space. As Bitcoin approaches the $100,000 price point, MicroStrategy's innovative approach to corporate finance by leveraging Bitcoin is starting to attract a greater number of corporations to follow its lead. MicroStrategy's success is providing a tantalizing blueprint for other corporations to replicate its strategy in order to protect and even grow their treasury reserves in an era of monetary uncertainty. With the company's ""21/21"" plan to raise a whopping $42 billion of additional capital over the next few years, MicroStrategy may trigger a wave of institutional Bitcoin adoption that could continue to propel the crypto to new heights. MicroStrategy's innovative approach continues to catapult it to new heights. Data by YCharts The Bitcoin Treasury Strategy MicroStrategy's innovative approach to treasury management represents a significant shift from traditional corporate finance practices. Instead of holding cash reserves that steadily lose purchasing power due to inflation, the company has decided to swap cash for Bitcoin, viewing it as a superior store of value. What's more, MicroStrategy is taking its innovative approach one step further through the creative use of zero-interest convertible notes and equity offering, which allow the company to continuously expand its Bitcoin holdings while maintaining minimal debt service costs. The genius of MicroStrategy's approach comes from its self-reinforcing nature. As MicroStrategy grows its Bitcoin holdings, the stock becomes an increasingly attractive investment vehicle for investors looking for exposure to Bitcoin through more traditional investment vehicles. This demand for MicroStrategy's stock naturally drives its price up, which allows for the company to raise even more capital on favorable terms, which in turn allows it to buy even more Bitcoin. This creates a virtuous cycle of value creation, with the huge caveat that Bitcoin must keep appreciating in value for this strategy to continue working. Next Wave of Growth will likely be Driven by Copycat Effect MicroStrategy's success is already incentivizing emulation , notably from small companies like Rumble ( RUM ), Hoth Therapeutics, ( HOTH ), and Acurx Pharmaceuaticals ( ACXP ). While these companies are starting off with smaller investments into Bitcoin, they represent the beginnings of what could be a major trend. Initially, this approach will likely overwhelmingly be adopted by smaller companies or failing companies with nothing to lose, as was the case with MicroStrategy. However, even larger companies with major cash reserves could start to adopt this approach as evidence for the success of this strategy grows. As word continues to spread and as more and larger companies adopt this strategy, Bitcoin will likely experience even greater upward pressure, which will disproportionately benefit early adopters of this strategy like MicroStrategy. The potential for widespread corporate adoption is especially compelling given the current macroeconomics environment, where inflation concerns remain persistent, and fixed-income yields remain unattractive. MicroStrategy's model offers a tested blueprint that is particularly attractive in such a macroeconomic environment, especially if Bitcoin continues to appreciate anywhere close to how it has been over the past few years. The combination of Bitcoin's sharp value appreciation and the ability to raise capital at favorable rates could make MicroStrategy's approach an increasingly viable strategies for corporations of all sizes. Long-Term Potential MicroStrategy's ambitious 21/21 plan to raise $42 billion in additional capital drives home the company's commitment to scaling its Bitcoin treasury strategy. If MicroStrategy is able to successfully follow through on this capital raise, the company would almost certainly be the dominant corporate holder of Bitcoin for the foreseeable future. This long-term potential of MicroStrategy extends beyond Bitcoin's asset appreciation and the company's ability to leverage such appreciation. In the increasingly likely scenario that Bitcoin continues to gain mainstream acceptance, MicroStrategy is positioning itself to be a key player in the future of corporate finance, especially given its early-mover advantage. MicroStrategy could expand its services into providing Bitcoin-based financial services. Moreover, if an even larger company were to try to supplant MicroStrategy as the de facto Bitcoin proxy, this would only benefit MicroStrategy as it would only further drive up Bitcoin's price. Financial Performance MicroStrategy's financial results demonstrate the surprising effectiveness of its innovative strategy. The Q3, for instance, MicroStrategy achieved a BTC Yield of 5.1% and has set an even more ambitious target goal of 6% to 10% from 2025 to 2027. MicroStrategy's Bitcoin holdings, which are valued at approximately $40 billion, represents a significant premium over their cost basis, demonstrating the company's success in growing corporate value. The company's ability to raise capital at favorable rates in particularly noteworthy and has been key to the company's success in recent years. MicroStrategy's ability to issue billions in convertible notes at low-interest rates also demonstrate the market's growing confidence in its strategy, and will likely provide a solid foundation for further growth. MicroStrategy Risk Factors Although MicroStrategy's strategy has proven to be wildly successful thus far, investors should be aware that such a strategy is incredibly risky. The company's performance is heavily dependent upon Bitcoin's price movements, and any significant decline in Bitcoin's value will have a major impact on both the company's balance sheet and its ability to raise capital. MicroStrategy's aggressive leverage strategy, while incredibly effective in a bull market, will only amplify losses in a bear market and such a strategy is a double-edged sword. Moreover, regulatory risks remain ever present in crypto. While the current regulatory environment appears to be improving, especially with the election of Trump and the growing influence of crypto-friendly Elon Musk, there is no real way of predicting the long-term regulatory environment of crypto. As such, investors need to be incredibly wary of the concentration risk inherent in MicroStrategy's approach, as its performance is almost entirely dependent upon the fortunes of Bitcoin. Conclusion MicroStrategy represents an incredibly unique investment opportunity at the intersection of corporate financial innovation and cryptocurrency adoption. The company's growing success in implementing its Bitcoin treasury strategy, make it an attractive investment opportunity for investors seeking exposure to both crypto and innovative corporate finance strategies. While major risks remain, such as the fact that MicroStrategy's valuation of $94 billion is far in excess of its ~$40 billion in crypto holdings, which has been sharply criticized , this valuation could very well be cheap if Bitcoin were to keep appreciating at anywhere near its current pace.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4740924-the-microstrategy-effect-reshaping-corporate-treasury-management?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/36955473.jpeg

36955138,https://finbold.com/?p=215500,1732800863,"If you invested $1,000 in Bitcoin when Trump won the election, you’d now have this much","The election of Donald Trump to the office of President will go down in history as one of the most pivotal events of the year. Although pollsters were projecting a tight race, in the end, the GOP candidate secured victory over incumbent Vice President Kamala Harris in each swing state. Some of Trump’s proposed economic policies — in particular, his preference for tariffs, have caused widespread worry among market participants. They’re far from a done deal — Trump’s first term did include a bevy of promises that were ultimately not kept . However, the markets have certainly been fairly bullish regarding one thing — and that’s the President-elect’s stance on cryptocurrency. Beyond his own dealings in the space, through World Liberty Financial, which recently got a $30 million investment from Tron ( TRX ) founder Justin Sun, Trump has publicly supported crypto, intends to name a wide bevy of pro-crypto experts to hold public office , and intends to establish a strategic crypto reserve for the United States. Unsurprisingly, all of this has contributed significantly to the current bull run that the leading digital asset Bitcoin ( BTC ) is in. To clearly demonstrate how significant this upswing has been, let’s take a look at a simple hypothetical situation — how much money an investor would have if they had invested $1,000 in Bitcoin on November 5, the day of the election. Bitcoin prices have soared since the 2024 election On November 5, one BTC was priced at roughly $68,290 — having receded to that point from a prior $72,780 high on October 30. Unlike most recent presidential elections, this one was called rather quickly — Vice President Harris conceded just a day later, on November 6. Bitcoin price chart, November 5 to November 28. Source: Finbold At press time, one Bitcoin is trading at approximately $95,530 — a mark which represents a 40.22% increase compared to November 5 prices. Accordingly, a $1,000 investment made on November 5 would be worth $1,398 at the time of publication. This offers an interesting backdrop to reflect on entry points. For comparison’s sake, if you invested in BTC exactly six months ago, you would have made a negligibly better return of over 40% — or $1,404. If, however, you had bought $1,000 worth of Bitcoin on January 1, your gains would currently stand at 125% — in other words, $2,252. Bitcoin price YTD chart. Source: Finbold While some entry points are obviously superior to others, for now, BTC seems to be acting in accordance with one of the most widely-held maxims governing traditional financial assets — time in the market outperforms timing the market , and is much easier to accomplish. Although Bitcoin has hit a roadblock on its path to $100,000 , dollar-cost-averaging purchases are still likely to outperform attempts to buy a potential upcoming dip.

The cryptocurrency has seen a 36% gain over the past month, pushing its market capitalization to approximately $435 billion. Notably, amid this rally, analysts are forecasting even greater price heights, with growing optimism about the cryptocurrency’s potential as the year comes to an end. CryptoQuant analyst “Crypto SunMoon” identified Ethereum’s current rally as the beginning of its “secondary bull run.” In a tweet, the analyst chart highlighted previous bull cycles, showing that Ethereum has consistently exceeded its earlier price peaks during subsequent rallies. “Ethereum’s secondary bull run has begun. Historically, Ethereum’s second bull cycle has always significantly surpassed the price levels achieved in the first cycle.” He noted. This historical insight suggests the potential for substantial growth ahead, with past trends supporting bullish price projections for ETH. On the technical front, analyst Ali Martinez noted that Ethereum’s multi-year ascending price channel remains strong. He highlighted that recent trading activity has successfully broken through key resistance levels in the $2,800–$3,000 range, setting up ETH for further gains. “Our mid-term target forETH remains $6,000… Long-term target: $10,000,” wrote Martinez. On the longer time horizon, analyst CryptoWolf shared a bold prediction. He pointed to a three-year triangle consolidation pattern in Ethereum’s price chart, starting in November 2021, and a cup and handle pattern stating that a breakout could target $20,000. “No matter how you look at the ETH chart, it’s incredibly bullish. One way to view it is as a 3-year cup and handle, with major resistance at $4k. Once that’s cleared, a measured move places it north of $15k. It’s the most asymmetric bet you can make right now,” he tweeted . Meanwhile, CryptoQuant analyst JA Maartun noted that Ethereum’s open interest had hit an all-time high of $16.8 billion, with a 24-hour increase of 19%. Maartun viewed this as a signal of increased investor interest in purchasing Ethereum, tweeting, “Popcorn ready? This guarantees heavy fireworks.” This update comes after the pundit warned of increased market risks. Just a day earlier, he had stated that Ethereum’s price surge was “being fueled by leveraged positions, indicating heightened risk in the market. This often presents a strong short-term shorting opportunity.” At press time, ETH was trading at $3,605, reflecting a 4.84% surge over the past 24 hours.",POSITIVE,ETH,BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/ethereum-eyes-10000-as-second-bull-run-takes-shape-analyst-claims/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

Avalanche (AVAX) recently captured headlines with its Avalanche9000 upgrade, skyrocketing trading volume to record highs and setting the stage for a potential price rally. Meanwhile, Algorand (ALGO) grabbed attention with a surprising price surge, touching $0.33—its best performance in months—before settling near $0.26. But the real star of the moment? Qubetics ($TICS), the revolutionary Web3 aggregator, is making waves with its presale, attracting over 4,500 holders and raising $3.4 million. Qubetics is more than just a presale darling—it’s solving real-world problems its predecessors never dared to address. With cutting-edge tools like the QubeQode IDE and a vast code snippet library, they're ready made for you to include features as per your convenience without any coding knowledge. Let’s check into why these three projects are among the best cryptos to buy today. Qubetics ($TICS): Transforming Investment Potential Qubetics’s the world’s first Web3 aggregator, designed to make blockchain development seamless. At the heart of its ecosystem is the QubeQode IDE , an integrated development environment that simplifies coding for businesses and individuals alike. Whether you're a small business owner wanting to build a blockchain-based loyalty programme or a freelance developer working on a smart contract, QubeQode’s intuitive platform delivers. You’re developing a decentralised app but hit a roadblock with a complex Ethereum function. Instead of scouring forums or writing code from scratch, you open Qubetics’ Code Snippet Library, which hosts pre-written, vetted solutions. With just a click, you’ve solved hours’ worth of work—no stress, no fuss. This innovative tool empowers professionals and hobbyists to launch blockchain projects faster than ever before. It's this utility that’s drawing over 4,500 token holders to the $TICS presale. Post-presale , $TICS is expected to surge to $1, delivering a staggering 3787% return. What does this mean for you? Let’s say you invest $10 in $TICS today at $0.025 per token. That gets you 400 tokens. It’s not just about potential profits—it’s about being part of a project that’s revolutionising Web3. Avalanche (AVAX): High Volume and Big Moves Avalanche is on fire, cementing its place among the best cryptos to buy today. Its recent Avalanche9000 upgrade debuted on the Fuji testnet and promises to revolutionise blockchain scalability. With deployment costs slashed by 99.9% and over $40 million in retroactive rewards available for developers, Avalanche is attracting massive attention. The numbers speak for themselves. AVAX’s trading volume hit $2.22 billion, the highest since March. Futures Open Interest surged to $525.41 million, signalling fresh investments. Analysts believe this uptick is setting the stage for a significant price rally. Currently trading around $41.25, AVAX has a bullish target of $50 in the short term. AVAX’s partnerships with giants like Visa and BlackRock underscore its real-world adoption. For those looking to invest in a project with both short-term gains and long-term utility, Avalanche is an obvious choice. Algorand (ALGO): A Grand Comeback Algorand has been making waves, reclaiming its spot as a project to watch. Algorand’s blockchain is renowned for its security, speed, and sustainability. These features make it a favourite for developers and institutions alike. Recently, Algorand has been tapping into the decentralised finance (DeFi) space, offering new liquidity pools that deliver stellar returns. Investors are advised to stay patient. Historically, altcoins like ALGO take off during specific phases of the bull run, and analysts believe the real rally hasn’t even started. The upcoming altseason could see ALGO break new records. Imagine investing $10 in ALGO now at $0.26 per token, giving you approximately 38 tokens. If ALGO doubles to $0.52 during altseason, your $10 grows to $19.76. While it might not seem as explosive as $TICS or AVAX, ALGO offers a steady, reliable growth trajectory. With a loyal community and a track record of innovation, Algorand remains a strong contender among the best cryptos to buy today. Which Crypto Will You Choose? Choosing the best cryptos to buy today depends on your investment goals. For explosive growth, Qubetics ($TICS) offers unparalleled potential with its groundbreaking Web3 tools and presale momentum. Avalanche (AVAX) combines technical innovation with real-world applications, making it a solid pick for both short-term gains and long-term value. Algorand (ALGO), with its proven blockchain and DeFi expansion, appeals to investors seeking stability in a volatile market. The crypto market moves fast, and opportunities don’t wait. Whether you're after quick profits or want to be part of the next big thing, now's the time to act. Don’t miss out on $TICS presale before the price hikes this weekend.

36954852,https://zycrypto.com/?p=98110,1732800275,More Boost For XRP As Ripple Expands Blockchain Innovation with Tokenized Money Market Fund,"Ripple continues to break new ground in tokenized finance, unveiling the first-ever tokenized money market fund on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). Announced Monday, this milestone is a collaboration with Archax, the first FCA-regulated digital asset exchange, and Abrdn, a leading UK asset manager with over £500 billion in assets under management. The tokenized fund, part of Abrdn’s £3.8 billion US Dollar Liquidity Fund (Lux), is set to bring financial assets onto the blockchain, marking a significant step toward institutional adoption of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs). Ripple also pledged $5 million to support this initiative as part of a broader fund to foster RWAs on the XRP Ledger (XRPL), with investments managed by various asset managers. “ There is now real momentum building for tokenized real-world assets, and Archax is at the forefront of tokenizing assets such as equities, debt instruments, and money market funds.” Graham Rodford, CEO of Archax, noted. Markus Infanger, RippleX’s Senior Vice President, added, “The arrival of abrdn’s money market fund on XRPL demonstrates how real-world assets are being tokenized to enhance operational efficiencies, further reinforcing XRPL as a leading blockchain for RWA tokenization.” That said, this announcement coincides with Ripple’s ongoing development of RLUSD, a US dollar-linked stablecoin launched in beta earlier this year. Designed for enterprise clients, RLUSD is backed by partners like Bitstamp, Bitso, MoonPay, and Bullish, with liquidity from market makers such as B2C2 and Keyrock. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently described RLUSD as a “high-quality stablecoin” set to become a gold standard in payments, DeFi, and RWAs. Public access to RLUSD will follow regulatory approval, with Garlinghouse emphasizing the firm’s focus on compliance. Notably, industry forecasts predict tokenized assets could grow to $16 trillion by 2030, underscoring the significance of Ripple’s initiatives. Ripple is leveraging the XRPL’s robust features, such as tokenization, escrow, and trading, to drive institutional-grade decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. While pioneering blockchain finance, Ripple continues its legal battle with the SEC, which accused the company in 2020 of raising $1.3 billion through unregistered XRP sales. In July 2023, Ripple secured a partial victory when a judge ruled secondary sales of XRP did not violate securities laws. However, institutional sales exceeding $700 million were not exempt. In August 2024, Ripple was fined $125 million, significantly lower than the SEC’s demand of $2 billion. The SEC has since appealed parts of the ruling. Despite these challenges, Ripple remains committed to advancing blockchain solutions.",POSITIVE,XRP,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | WALLET | XRP,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/more-boost-for-xrp-as-ripple-expands-blockchain-innovation-with-tokenized-money-market-fund/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

Leading altcoins, including Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), Cardano (ADA), Ripple (XRP), and more, have also recorded significant gains. BTC Goes on the Offensive Again The primary cryptocurrency performed quite shaky towards the end of the weekend and the start of this week, with its valuation briefly plunging below $91,000 on November 26. However, the bulls stepped in in the past 24 hours, pushing BTC to as high as $97,300 (per CoinGecko’s data). Shortly after, the price headed south again, reaching the current $95,300. This represents a 2% increase on a daily scale and a solid 35% rise on a monthly basis . BTC Price, Source: CoinGecko BTC’s latest resurgence comes on the back of increased US consumer spending and inflation rate which remains above the Federal Reserve’s target of 2%. It will be interesting to see the central bank’s reaction to that development and whether it will affect the price of the leading digital asset. Meanwhile, BTC’s market cap has risen to almost $1.9 trillion, while its dominance over the alternative coins is around 57%. ETH Leads the Altcoin Charge Some well-known altcoins have witnessed even more substantial pumps than the market leader. Ethereum (ETH), for instance, hit a six-month high of almost $3,700 amid increased spot Ether ETF inflows in the United States. Binance Coin (BNB) and Cardano (ADA) are also among the gainers, registering 5% and 4% daily spikes. Other altcoins in green territory include Ripple (XRP), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and many more. Interestingly, Stellar (XLM), which has been among the frontrunners in the past several days, is one of the few seeing a minor decline today (November 28).

36954850,https://zycrypto.com/?p=98108,1732799894,From Meme Coin to Market Giant: Dogecoin (DOGE) Surpasses Ford and Eyes 500% Rally,"After a strong performance last week, Dogecoin (DOGE) faced a slight pullback due to broader market volatility, mainly driven by Bitcoin’s fluctuating price. Notably , DOGE surged to $0.47 on Saturday , marking its highest level since May 2021. This spike followed a month-long rally, during which the coin experienced an incredible 165% gain. This surge has solidified DOGE’s place among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. DOGE’s market cap currently stands at $58.6 billion, surpassing well-established companies like Ford, Porsche , Adidas, and Delta Airlines. The meteoric rise of DOGE highlights the growing influence of meme coins in the crypto landscape. With its market value exceeding those of major corporations, some investors are taking DOGE more seriously. The coin’s loyal community and endorsements from high-profile figures like Elon Musk are often cited as key drivers behind its success. Notably, the momentum behind DOGE remains strong. According to crypto analytics firm Cryptoquant co-founders, retail investors are increasingly jumping on the DOGE bandwagon, with retail trading activity hitting an all-time high. In a Wednesday tweet, the analysts noted that retail investors are more interested in meme coins than Bitcoin. Sentiment around DOGE remains positive, further buoyed by developments such as the launch of the world’s first Dogecoin ETP , which gives Swedish investors regulated exposure to the memecoin via the Spotlight Stock Market. This innovation is expected to fuel more bullish sentiment. Looking ahead, analysts are predicting continued growth for DOGE. Cryptosahintas, a popular figure in the crypto community with over 222,000 followers on X (formerly Twitter), shared a chart forecasting a potential 525% rally for DOGE from its current levels. His analysis suggested that DOGE could repeat its historical market moves after recently breaking out of a triangle consolidation pattern. Meanwhile, analyst Master Kenobi shared a multi-year price channel, noting he believes DOGE is poised to reach a new all-time high (ATH) around December 2, 2024. Drawing comparisons to past cycles, he pointed out that massive price moves, such as the breakout from the green trendline to the orange one, have occurred twice before. Kenobi projects that DOGE could reach as high as $1.08, with a possible target of $2.90, placing his conservative estimate between $1.40 and $1.45. At press time, DOGE was trading at $0.4033, marking a 1.28% increase over the past 24 hours. However, analyst Ali Martinez warned that the price is currently at a critical resistance level. He said a sustained breakout above $0.40 could push the price to $0.43. On the other hand, if DOGE fails to surpass the $0.40 resistance, it may face a pullback, with potential drops to $0.36 or even $0.34.",POSITIVE,DOGE,BTC | BUSINESS | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/from-meme-coin-to-market-giant-dogecoin-doge-surpasses-ford-and-eyes-500-rally/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

Ethereum ( ETH ), the second-biggest cryptocurrency, jumped to $3,690, its highest level since June 10. It has soared by 70% from its lowest level this month, and one popular analyst expects its to get to $10,000 in this bull run. In an X post, Ali Martinex , a popular crypto analyst with almost 100,000 X followers, estimated that the coin will get to $6,000 in this cycle. His long-term view is that ETH price will ultimately jump to $10,000. If his view is accurate, it means that the coin will jump by 65% and 176%.

Ethereum price has strong technicals ETH chart | source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the ETH price has done well in the past few days. It has just formed a golden cross pattern as the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages crossed each other. This is one of the most popular bullish patterns in the market. Ethereum price has also jumped above the crucial resistance point at $3,558, its highest level on July 21. Further, the Percentage Price Oscillator and the Relative Strength Index have all moved upwards. Therefore, the short-term outlook is where ETH jumps and retests its year-to-date high of $4,088. A break above that level will point to more gains, with the next point to watch being the psychological level at $5,000. This view will become invalid if it drops below the support at $3,100.

36956563,https://invezz.com/?p=2317626,1732799762,Hong Kong proposes crypto tax breaks to compete as global financial hub,"Hong Kong has unveiled a proposal to exempt cryptocurrency gains from taxes for hedge funds, private equity, and family offices. The tax exemption plan, currently under a six-week public consultation, also covers investments in private credit, overseas property, and carbon credits. If implemented, the tax break could attract global liquidity and bolster Hong Kong’s digital economy. According to a recent report , the move is a part of Hong Kong’s strategy to strengthen its standing as a leading crypto financial hub and position it competitively against contending jurisdictions which offer similar tax incentives. For instance, Hong Kong faces competition from nations like Singapore , which implemented its Variable Capital Company (VCC) framework in 2020. The VCC framework allows fund managers to consolidate multiple investment portfolios under a single legal entity, providing operational flexibility and tax efficiencies. It now hosts over 1,000 funds, attracting international investors. In response, Hong Kong has been promoting its Open-Ended Fund Company (OFC) structure, which allows funds to be set up with flexible share issuance and redemption options while benefiting from tax exemptions on certain fund-related activities. Since October 2023, over 450 funds have been launched under the OFC scheme. The latest move to introduce tax breaks on crypto gains is an extension of Hong Kong’s efforts to make the city a more attractive destination for global fund managers and investors. Commenting on the development, Justin d’Anethan, an analyst, described the tax exemption as a “strategic” move. He noted that Hong Kong aims to attract “talent, capital, and innovation” in a decentralised, fast-moving industry through lower taxes and clear regulations. Hong Kong’s focus on crypto investing As previously reported by Invezz, the proposal was first hinted at by Christopher Hui, Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, in late October. Hui said at the time that the measure forms part of a larger strategy to enhance Hong Kong’s role in managing a broad range of financial assets, including cryptocurrencies. This effort, he said, was essential for Hong Kong to remain competitive on a global scale. Hong Kong has made additional strides to position itself as a global crypto hub. ZA Bank, the city’s largest virtual bank, recently introduced services allowing retail users to trade Bitcoin and Ether. In July, the bank was authorised to hold reserve assets for stablecoin issuers under Hong Kong’s new regulations. Adding to its crypto initiatives, the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited launched a Virtual Asset Index Series on November 15. This platform provides real-time benchmarks for Bitcoin and Ether, offering transparency and reliability for investors engaging in digital asset trading. Meanwhile, Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission has also shown its interest in licensing more crypto exchanges by the end of 2024. Currently, three licensed exchanges operate in the region, serving both retail and institutional investors. The most recent approval was granted to Hong Kong Virtual Asset Exchange Limited in October. During the 2024 Hong Kong FinTech Week, Eric Yip, the SFC’s Executive Director for Intermediaries, confirmed that a final list of fully licensed crypto exchanges will be released by year-end.

PYTH bullish reversal gains momentum The altcoin’s price movements form an ascending channel pattern on the 24-hour chart. The higher lows and higher highs have printed two parallel lines as PYTH’s reversals gain momentum. The rally tests the trendline’s top boundary, attempting an upside breakout rally. Meanwhile, the upward journey began from the support barrier at $0.25 to today’s peak of $0.4805. That translates to a 92.2% surge within the past three months.

Pyth remains 8% up on its daily chart, with a 30% increase in trading volume signaling increased activity. Source: Coinmarketcap The altcoin boasts more room for extended gains. Fibonacci levels show the token targeting 50% FIB ($0.6759). The latest gains saw the 50-day and 20-day Exponential Moving Averages making a golden crossover. That indicates a solid bullish momentum behind Pyth’s prevailing price actions. Furthermore, PYTH created a bullish, engulfing candlestick following its overnight surges. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence and the signal line support the narrative with an upside crossover. The highlighted bullish engulfing candlestick tests the overhead borderline as the token topped the 638.20% FIB level. PYTH eyes further uptrends after reclaiming the supply region between $0.51 and $0.54. Significant bull activity beyond this range would catalyze swift uptrends to $0.8. That would account for a 73% upswing from current prices. Nevertheless, sudden bearishness could push the alt towards the reliable support zones at $0.43 and $0.35. Further bearishness would see PYTH plunging beneath the 50-day Exponential Moving Average ($0.3181), invalidating the potential rounding bottom reversal. That might welcome an 88% slump from current values to $0.2460. Meanwhile, Pyth Network has seen increased institutional interest lately.

Indeed, having risen approximately 40% between election day and press time on November 28, the world’s premier cryptocurrency is closer than ever to the ambitious target and even found itself within $1,000 of the six digit figure on November 22. Still, the high volatility and several successive corrections – started in earnest on Sunday, November 24 – have reignited the question of whether $100,000 is truly within reach or if a plunge toward $80,000 would come first. With the current setup having the coin somewhere in between Bitcoin’s current price of $95,413, Finbold decided to consult one of the most advanced artificial intelligence (AI) models available to determine whether investors will be welcomed back from Thanksgiving by BTC at the new all-time high (ATH) or something entirely different. BTC 30-day price chart. Source: Finbold ChatGPT predicts BTC price after Thanksgiving ChatGPT-4o proved rather direct when predicting Bitcoin’s Cyber Monday price. It estimated that the current momentum, driven by heightened institutional interest and investor bullishness but tempered by the likely lower volume and amplified volatility, would lead to BTC at $99,200. ChatGPT sets Bitcoin price target for Cyber Monday. Source: Finbold & ChatGPT-4o When asked about the lower volatility, the AI explained that multiple studies – such as the one conducted in 2022 by Arcane Research and transmitted by Finbold , among other outlets – indicate that the U.S. accounts for much of the cryptocurrency market trading volume. With the stock market closed during the holidays and investors generally seeking to distance themselves temporarily from the buzz, fewer people are likely to be active between Thursday, November 28, and Cyber Monday, December 2. Still, ChatGPT pointed out that this likely low volume will increase volatility generated by each individual trade but also warned that the situation might still not favor extreme moves. AI forecasts when Bitcoin will finally hit $100,000 Additionally, when asked what are the likely outer bounds of Bitcoin’s price range before it hits the forecasted $99,200 on Cyber Monday, the AI explained they stand at $94,000 – indicating corrections akin to what was seen on Tuesday, November 26, are unlikely – and at $100,500 – thus confirming it believes a new all-time high (ATH) will be set but not maintained.

36954613,https://zycrypto.com/?p=98106,1732799451,"Bitcoin Well On Track To Hit $740,000 By April 2028 — Pantera CEO","Dan Morehead , founder and CEO of Pantera Capital — the first crypto fund in the United States — is forecasting that the price of Bitcoin could smash $700,000 in 2028, roughly a week after the flagship crypto rocketed toward a six-digit price. Despite Bitcoin’s astronomical growth in recent months, Morehead thinks it’s “still early” for BTC and that the cryptocurrency’s bull market has yet to run. Bitcoin’s Path To $740,000 Dan Morehead noted in a Nov. 26 blog post that 5% of financial wealth is now exposed to Bitcoin. Yet, that figure is set to increase with more regulatory clarity in the U.S. as pro-blockchain president-elect Donald Trump heads back to the White House. This would result in faster institutionalization of Bitcoin. BlackRock and Fidelity with spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds have started a “massive transformation,” posited Morehead. “It’s [Bitcoin] already done three orders of magnitude,” Morehead wrote. He revealed that his investment company’s crypto-focused Pantera Bitcoin Fund, which was launched in 2013, has notched an over 131,000% lifetime return on its first Bitcoin purchase at $7. “Another one seems plausible.” Per the Pantera CEO, Bitcoin has been on a trendline that will push its value to roughly $740,000 by April 2028 (a nearly 670% growth from the current price point) if it continues its growth pattern. The world’s oldest cryptocurrency was trading for about 2.3% higher at around $95,294 at publication time. “I just can’t help thinking that we still have many more years of very compelling returns.” $15 Trillion Market Cap For Bitcoin $740,000 is “not an inconceivable number, relative to $500 trillion in financial assets,” he explained. At this price, Bitcoin would boast a market capitalization of a whopping $15 trillion. “I can imagine an investor thinking: ‘Bitcoin has doubled this year. Well, I guess I missed it,’” Morehead said. “That’s the wrong mindset.” Furthermore, Morehead told CNBC’s Squawk Box on Nov. 27 that he doesn’t think Bitcoin could ever crash to zero now as it has reached “escape velocity” with 300 million investors around the world owning it.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-well-on-track-to-hit-740000-by-april-2028-pantera-ceo/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

Binance Futures List Chill Guy Meme Coin - But Is The Top Already In? Just A Chill Guy has been one of the top trending meme coins on the market, thanks to the viral “chill guy” meme coin on TikTok. The meteoric CHILLGUY price rally has already turned several small-scale retail investors into millionaires.

However, its debut on Binance failed to result in a bullish continuation. The CHILLGUY price is now trading at $0.55, down nearly 16% from today’s high. In fact, recently a Binance Futures listing has resulted in a local top for the meme coin, as evidenced by the price action of CHEEMS and WHY. It would, therefore, be no surprise if the Chill Guy meme coin saw a pullback in the coming days before resuming its uptrend. What’s The Best Crypto To Buy Now? Pepe Unchained (PEPU) has firmly established itself as the hottest presale commodity in the meme coin sector. The new meme coin continues to add over $2 million to its presale total daily, nearing the $55 million mark, thanks to heavy whale bidding in its ICO. For instance, a whale swapped $140k worth of ETH for PEPU on Tuesday. Meanwhile, $50k buys in a single transaction are regular occurrences for the meme coin. Indeed, Pepe Unchained has appealed to whales and retailers alike with its in-demand utilities, whether it is its Layer-2 ecosystem that will soon offer extremely low trading costs and instant transactions, Pepe’s Pump Pad that is being seen as a competitor to Solana’s Pump Fun or its presale staking protocol which is currently offering an APY of 60%. Some prominent influencers are even calling it the next 100x meme coin. Meanwhile, CatSlap has also taken the meme coin sector by storm, thanks to the viral “slapping cat” meme. The SLAP price skyrocketed by 5,750% following its launch. However, it has since corrected by 70% as whales secured their profits and is now poised for the next upside move. With upcoming Tier-1 exchange listings, token burn and a slap-to-earn game, CatSlap is set for a bullish reversal to new all-time highs. There is also speculation of a Binance listing. Prominent experts like Michael Wrubel are still eyeing 50x returns from SLAP, while others are calling it one of the best cryptos to buy now.

While some cash in on Bitcoin’s early days or Ethereum’s rise, others have ridden the wave of lesser-known coins that exploded in value. The question is are you letting the next big opportunity slip through your fingers? Every year brings a fresh crop of innovative projects, and 2025 is no different. With the crypto market evolving rapidly, new players are emerging every day, ready to capture the spotlight. This could be the year to act, not just watch. Because waiting could mean watching others seize the gains you’re dreaming of. Here’s a roundup of the best crypto presale coins for 2025 — including BlockDAG, PEPU, Flockerz, Crypto All-Stars, and Moo Deng. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): Scaling New Crypto Heights BlockDAG (BDAG) leads this list of best crypto presale coins for 2025 — a project making waves as 2024 nears its close. Designed with a cutting-edge DAG-PoW hybrid architecture, it enables parallel transaction processing, offering faster and more efficient solutions to blockchain’s scalability issues. After raising an impressive $20 million in under 48 hours, BlockDAG’s total presale now stands at over $150 million with over 16.6 billion coins sold. The project’s growing community of over 170,000 holders shows that BlockDAG presale reflects strong market confidence. Plus, BlockDAG’s successful mainnet development and ongoing auditing further highlight the team’s focus on transparency and innovation. Analysts predict BDAG could deliver a remarkable 30,000x ROI and potentially reach $1 by 2025 and $30 by 2030. Backed by influential crypto experts and a robust roadmap, BlockDAG combines advanced technology with real-world applicability. As one of the most promising crypto projects for 2025, BlockDAG tops the list for its ability to merge scalability with community engagement, paving the way for long-term growth. 2. Pepe Unchained (PEPU): Building the Future of Meme Coins Following the trail of promising investments, PEPU gains traction as a notable project in the meme coin space for 2025. After a strong first pick, PEPU took the spotlight, raising over $40 million in its presale, reflecting solid community interest. The project focuses on creating a Layer-2 ecosystem that offers faster transactions and lower costs. Additionally, the developer grant program fosters innovation, encouraging builders to contribute to the ecosystem. These efforts keep PEPU relevant and adaptable in a rapidly changing market. 3. Crypto All-Stars (STARS): Multi-Chain Mastery Crypto All-Stars (STARS) is another promising pick in the list of best crypto presale coins for 2025. Its presale has raised over $4.4 million, reflecting the increased interest in this microcap meme coin. STARS introduces MemeVault, a multi-chain staking platform supporting 11 meme coins and offering diverse rewards. Built on the ERC-1155 standard, MemeVault ensures compatibility across major blockchains like Ethereum, Base, and Solana. While meme coins can be volatile, which may affect returns, the project’s innovative staking approach sets it apart as a unique option in the evolving crypto market. 4. Flockerz (FLOCK): Vote-to-Earn Innovator The third one on the list of best crypto presale coins for 2025 is Flockerz (FLOCK). Branded as the ""people’s meme coin,"" it blends decentralization with a vote-to-earn model. All FLOCK holders are part of the Flocktopia DAO, shaping decisions on marketing, listings, and features while earning rewards. Its presale has already raised $2.8 million, appealing to whales and retail investors. However, some may find transparency a concern with anonymous developers and no KYC verification. Despite this, its community-driven governance offers a refreshing take on how meme coins can empower their holders in a decentralized ecosystem. 5. Moo Deng (MOODENG): Hippo Hype Hits Blockchain Following Flockerz, Moo Deng (MOODENG) is another one of the best crypto presale coins for 2025. Inspired by a viral baby hippo from a Thai zoo, Moo Deng blends internet culture with blockchain innovation. Built on Solana, it has gained attention for its unique concept and widespread appeal. According to analysts, after reaching an all-time high of $0.69, the coin is expected to consolidate before potentially reaching $1.51 by 2026. Its connection to a real-world mascot adds a layer of charm, making it a standout in the meme coin space. Which One to Choose From The Best Crypto Presale Coins for 2025? As we conclude our roundup of the best crypto presale coins for 2025, each coin shows its potential and strength that sets it apart from the rest. From Pepe Unchained's innovative ecosystem and Crypto All-Stars' unique staking platform to Flockerz's community-driven model and Moo Deng's viral appeal offers distinct opportunities — all these coins show growth potential. However, BlockDAG (BDAG) leads as the prime choice for its advanced DAG-PoW architecture, strong market backing, and impressive community that highlight its potential for scalability and significant returns. For traders seeking a blend of innovation and stability, BlockDAG represents the most promising option as we move into 2025.

SHIB has overcome critics with its ecosystem supported by layer-2 scaling solution Shibarium, becoming among the most traded penny cryptocurrencies. Though the glory days of SHIB's 2021 parabolic increases seem to be behind, its development and community support have confirmed its status. On-chain statistics and market factors point to SHIB perhaps rallying during the next bull run, but recreating its explosive gain of 2021 is quite improbable. SHIB Price Forecast Regularly attracting interest from both individual and institutional investors, Shiba Inu has established itself as among the top penny cryptocurrencies. Ranked 11th by market capitalization right now, SHIB keeps a competitive advantage over Dogecoin. Driven mostly by events within its ecosystem, such as the release of Shibarium—a Layer-2 scaling solution meant to improve transaction speed and lower costs—Shiba Inu has jumped by 76.72%. With some experts speculating that SHIB could hit $0.003 under ideal market conditions, this development has spurred hopeful price projections. Such an aim is based on things like further acceptance in decentralized finance (DeFi), strong community support, and a more general positive market trend, which marks a huge jump. Still, reaching this mark seems unlikely to be easy sailing. The price path of SHIB is still entwined with the supremacy of Bitcoin and the general market mood, which adds instability to its route of possible development. Notwithstanding this hope, current on-chain data show a different situation. Data from IntoTheBlock shows that while big transaction volumes have reduced by 45.26%, active SHIB addresses have dropped from 3,402 to 3,360. Furthermore, indicating the residual bearish attitude, almost half of SHIB holders are in the red right now. With a 94% connection to Bitcoin, SHIB fights to overcome notable levels of resistance, including $0.000026. Although SHIB would see modest increases, it seems improbable that the parabolic heights of 2021 would be duplicated. With major obstacles to face before returning to its previous splendor, analysts estimate SHIB's price might drop by up to 17% by the end of 2024. A Better Opportunity Amid SHIB's Uncertainty Rexas Finance presents a great substitute for Shiba Inu as it struggles to repeat its prior success, ready to cause ripples in the crypto market. Rexas Finance offers a platform for tokenizing and managing physical assets such as real estate, art, and intellectual property, so adding actual value to the blockchain area, unlike meme coins. Through improved accessibility, openness, and efficiency, Rexas Finance is transforming asset management. Using blockchain technology, the platform gives asset owners and investors almost endless chances for liquidity and investment. For those looking for sustainable development, Rexas Finance is a fascinating choice, as this creative strategy places it front and first in the asset-tokenizing revolution. Rexas Finance sets itself out by choosing a community-first strategy over venture capitalism. Individual investors who share the vision of this concept have become rather supportive of it. With tokens costing $0.08, the project now resides in Stage 6 of its presale. Selling 179, 167,083 tokens out of 200,000,000, the presale has already raised $10,533,548 of its $12,200,000 goal. Investors have a special chance to get a 150% assured gain with a projected listing price of $0.20 on three main exchanges in early 2025. Along with a CertiK audit guaranteeing security and openness, the platform's legitimacy is strengthened by its listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. Through events like a $1 million token giveaway with 20 winners each earning $50,000 worth of RXS tokens, Rexas Finance also actively involves its expanding community. With almost 247,934 entries, the campaign has greatly raised awareness and involvement, therefore confirming Rexas Finance's reputation as a project of interest. Rexas Finance is positioned to lead the charge in the unexplored field of real-world asset tokenizing as the Bitcoin market starts a bull run. One of the most expected tokens on the market since industry analysts are hinting at an amazing 20,000% price rise during this bull cycle. Conclusion Shiba Inu keeps its footing in the meme currency market, but the glory of its bull run is only a memory. Rexas Finance provides a more interesting path for investors looking for development potential with its creative approach to asset tokenization and outstanding presale success. As Rexas Finance gets ready for its first bull run, the crypto market is gathering speed, and it is likely to provide hitherto unheard-of gains, which makes it an appealing investment possibility.

36954099,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=655368,1732798803,Is BONK Rally In Jeopardy? Technical Indicators Confirm Weakness,"BONK is facing mounting bearish pressure as technical indicators signal growing weakness in the market. After a brief attempt to stabilize, the token appears to be losing momentum dropping again toward the $0.00004002 for another test, with key metrics pointing to further downside. As BONK navigates these challenging conditions, speculations are on whether the meme coin can reclaim its footing or if deeper losses are inevitable. This analysis dives into BONK’s current market performance under bearish conditions, highlighting the technical indicators that signal potential weakness. Furthermore, we will assess the likelihood of a recovery or a continuation of BONK’s downward trajectory by analyzing critical support levels, market trends, and the broader outlook, Technical Indicators Signal Growing Weakness For BONK On the 4-hour chart, BONK exhibits negative sentiment, trading below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) as it trends downward toward the $0.00004002 support level. A continued descent to this support suggests that selling pressure is intensifying, and if the support fails to hold, the asset could experience more declines. Also, an analysis of the 4-hour chart reveals that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has now declined to the 44% level following a previous attempt to rally, which peaked at 49% before losing strength. A declining RSI, particularly as it remains below the neutral 50% level, indicates that bearish momentum is building. If the RSI continues to dip, it could further validate the downtrend, potentially leading to more significant price drops as selling pressure intensifies. Related Reading: BONK In Trouble As Sharp Decline Hints At An Impending Pullback On the daily chart, the meme coin displays notable downward movement, highlighted by a bearish candlestick with a strong rejection wick that has emerged after a failed recovery attempt. The inability to sustain an upside direction implies a lack of buyer confidence and a prevailing negative sentiment in the market. As BONK aims at the $0.00004002 support level, the pressure from sellers could intensify, raising concerns about the possibility of a breakdown. Finally, the 1-day RSI shows increasing negative pressure on the cryptocurrency, with the signal line dropping sharply from the overbought zone to 56%. This decline marks a shift in momentum, indicating that buying strength is weakening and selling pressure is rising. Should the RSI continue to fall, it could signal sustained pessimistic sentiment and declines for BONK. Bounce Back Or Further Decline? Two potential scenarios are likely as BONK faces bearish pressure: a bounce back or further decline. If the meme coin can hold the critical $0.00004002 support level and attract renewed buying interest, it could spark a recovery, possibly reversing the current downtrend and pushing the price to the $0.00006247 resistance range and beyond. Related Reading: Bonk Downward Drift To $0.00002635, Can Bulls Ignite A Trend Reversal? However, if selling pressure persists and BONK fails to sustain the $0.00004002 support level, a deeper decline may follow, with the price potentially dropping to lower support zones, including $0.00002962, $0.00002320, and below.

The company is accelerating Bitcoin mining capacity expansion, targeting 50 EH/s by mid-2025, supported by advanced hardware like S21 Pro miners. With low-cost Bitcoin production at $29,000 per coin and competitive efficiency metrics, IREN is well-positioned for profitability despite price volatility. The Sweetwater data center project, with 1.4GW capacity, highlights IREN’s ambition to scale AI/HPC services alongside Bitcoin mining operations. Despite high Q3 CAPEX, IREN remains undervalued, with a forward P/S ratio of 2.2 and growth prospects in a bullish crypto market. Iris Energy Limited ( IREN ) continues at the forefront of sustainable innovation in its three business areas: Bitcoin mining, high-performance computing [HPC], and artificial intelligence [AI] cloud services. The company has successfully expanded its operations across North America and Australia, using exclusively renewable energy. IREN’s main focus is cost efficiency, scalability, and infrastructure innovation to capitalize on the demand for digital technologies. IREN’s fast growth, with expected production of 50 EH/s by mid-2025, and cutting-edge initiatives in AI and HPC position it favorably in these niches. Also, IREN’s valuation still appears reasonable, especially considering its upcoming growth with Bitcoin’s ongoing bull market. Thus, I reiterate my “Buy” on IREN for long-term investors seeking exposure to the green energy and bitcoin mining sectors. Promising Secular Tailwinds: Business Overview At its core, Iris Energy is a data center company specializing in bitcoin mining, high-performance computing [HPC], and Artificial Intelligence [AI] cloud services. It was founded in 2018 and is headquartered in Sidney, Australia, with operations across North America and Australia. Since my article from December 2023, IREN’s stock has substantially appreciated. The key aspects of IREN are its ongoing expansion, focus on renewable energy, and commitment to environmental responsibility. Source: Q1 FY25 Results Presentation. November 26, 2024. Currently, IREN’s primary business area is Bitcoin mining , which reached 31 exahashes per second [EH/s] by the end of Q3 2024. Thanks to the operation of its site in Childress County, Texas, the company is preparing to grow its mining capacity to 50 EH/s by 1H2025. This is much faster than the initially anticipated date timeline of 2H2025. In fact, Childress was designed with infrastructure to support substantial power expansion of up to 50 megawatts monthly. IREN can scale up mining and install new hardware like the S21 Pro miners' machines. It’s worth mentioning that S21 Pro machines are advanced Bitcoin miner devices that work very efficiently. The company has pre-purchased this mining equipment at $18.9 per terahash [TH]. For context, TH is a unit of computational power used to obtain the solution of cryptographic puzzles in the blockchain. Also, IREN secured its S21 Pro miners at a fixed price, which should hedge it from future potential cost increases due to a rapidly appreciating cryptocurrency bull market in 2025. This way, the company can ensure financial predictability. Source: Q1 FY25 Results Presentation. November 26, 2024. The fast growth of the digital world, particularly Bitcoin mining, contrasts with the slower pace of the physical infrastructure required to support it. The current power usage for the Bitcoin mining network demands more than 20 gigawatts (GW) of electricity, and the consumption rises as mining activities expand. Thus, this strains the electricity supply and infrastructure. For instance, if the price of Bitcoin increases to $150,000 , mining will become more profitable, and miners will be incentivized to expand operations. However, such expansion would require an additional 7GW of power capacity. This would translate into an additional power generation and facilities CAPEX of approximately $9 billion . The infrastructure needs time to be developed, and it is a bottleneck in the network expansion that delays mining activities. Source: Q1 FY25 Results Presentation. November 26, 2024. Fortunately, IREN produces a low-cost Bitcoin, with a competitive cost of approximately $29,000 per Bitcoin at a hash rate of 31 EH/s. This cost is lower than many competitors due to highly efficient hardware that reduces energy consumption. Other factors for the low price are the lower electricity costs in Childress, Texas, and the economy of scale that decreases the cost per unit mined. IREN's cost-efficiency is an advantage for the company and positions it for better profitability, even when Bitcoin may lower its prices. Notably, the internal cost for IREN to run 1 EH/s of Bitcoin mining is $30 million, while the market valuation for this capacity is $120 million, highlighting the company's efficient cost structure. This efficiency ensures high returns, with investments in miners and data centers achieving a payback period of two years. Moreover, the scaling from 31 EH/s to 50 EH/s greatly improves profitability, reinforcing IREN's competitive position. Source: Q1 FY25 Results Presentation. November 26, 2024. Lastly, IREN’s other two business areas, AI and HPC , provide an additional diversification layer. For example, the company invested in advanced liquid cooling systems and NVIDIA GPUs to improve performance and efficiency. Also, IREN has installed 1,896 NVIDIA H100 and H200 GPUs to prepare to scale operations in response to customer demand. Transformative 2025: Power, Profit, and Potential IREN updated investors on its Sweetwater data center project in its latest quarterly report . The substation that will power the site will be operational in 15 months, ensuring the infrastructure the project needs. Sweetwater will deliver 1.4GW of power capacity, making it one of the largest power sites in the world. It is designed with 90 EH/s mining capacity and potentially hosts up to 800,000 GPUs for HPC activities. Meanwhile, Bitcoin reached historic highs in November 2024. However, Bitcoin is inherently volatile, so it remains an underlying risk for IREN. Despite this, Donald Trump's electoral victory has fueled optimism, as he ran on a pro-crypto agenda . Analysts anticipate a favorable political and regulatory environment that could encourage Bitcoin adoption, including discussions around the possibility of using Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset . Source: Seeking Alpha. Moreover, IREN announced it may also start distributions to shareholders in 2025. In theory, these distributions will be supported by increased cash flows from scaling activities and a focus on alternative funding instruments. So, for now, I think IREN’s scaling strategy, low-cost expansion, cryptocurrency tailwinds, and HPC markets make it well-positioned for long-term success. Growth Ahead: Valuation Analysis From a valuation perspective, IREN now trades at a $1.8 billion market cap, making it a midsized company in its sector. This is up roughly 143.5% since I covered it in December 2023, showing that the bull thesis I outlined back then is playing out. As of Q3 2024, its balance sheet held $98.6 million in cash and equivalents against no financial debt. Its book value stands at $1.1 billion, indicating a P/B of 1.6, which inherently denotes a moderate premium. For comparison, its sector’s median P/B is 3.3. Naturally, most of IREN’s book value stems from its PPE worth $966.0 million. Source: Seeking Alpha. Furthermore, according to Seeking Alpha’s dashboard on IREN , the company is projected to generate $809.0 million in revenues by 2026, suggesting a forward P/S of 2.2. This is actually much more reasonable compared to its sector’s median forward P/S of 3.2 . Thus, I think, on balance, IREN’s valuation multiples still appear undervalued in light of its impressive forecasted revenue growth and underlying assets. Moreover, I estimate IREN’s latest quarterly cash burn reached $391.0 million by adding its CFOs and Net CAPEX. This is the company’s main drawback, implying a cash runway of just 0.3 quarters. Thus, it’s evident that there’s a high likelihood of an equity raise relatively soon. Alternatively, I suppose IREN could tap into debt as well, especially since its growth is ramping up rapidly, and its balance sheet isn’t levered at this point. In my view, debt is probably the better choice because it avoids dilution and will probably be manageable, assuming IREN’s future revenue growth materializes. Source: IREN’s latest quarterly report. Additionally, it’s worth mentioning that Q3 2024 seems to have been an unusually capital-intensive quarter for IREN. Using the same approach as before, in Q3 2023, IREN’s cash burn was much more manageable at just $13.9 million . The main discrepancy in these two periods is that IREN seems to have made sizeable CAPEX on PPE and computer hardware for its operations. In my view, this seems reasonable, especially if we assume that the current Bitcoin cycle will probably last until 2025. In fact, I think this large CAPEX ahead of 2025 positions IREN perfectly to capitalize on Bitcoin’s ongoing bull market. Investment Caveats: Risk Analysis So, no additional raises may be necessary if IREN’s focus now transitions into maximizing its recent CAPEX. Moreover, IREN’s margins will likely improve as Childress scales up . Moreover, looking at IREN’s results in Q3 didn’t benefit from the recent Bitcoin price increase to over $90,000 . Those tailwinds will show up in Q4 2024, and there’s a material improvement at those price levels for IREN. Thus, I think it’s fair to remain bullish on IREN into 2025, so I reiterate my “Buy” rating. Source: Q1 FY25 Results Presentation. November 26, 2024. Unfortunately, this is also IREN’s main risk. If the price of Bitcoin declines significantly, it will undoubtedly put pressure on IREN’s revenues and margins. Moreover, it could be a double whammy for the company because it’s rapidly ramping up its CAPEX to capitalize fully on the current cryptocurrency bull market. Similarly, I would like to see IREN now pivot towards bolstering its balance sheet to endure any economic downturns, especially since its revenues are tightly linked to a highly volatile industry. Source: TradingView. Therefore, if IREN fails to capitalize on these current tailwinds or overexpands and doesn’t prioritize its balance sheet, it could lead to significant shareholders post-2025. My bear case for IREN is that by 2025, the company’s balance sheet may not improve enough, and the crypto bull market will end. If that occurs, it could catch IREN off balance, especially after such a massive ramp-up in PPE ahead of 2025. Nevertheless, as it stands today, if management now focuses on prudently reaping the rewards of this bull market , IREN could emerge post-2025 as a premier green cryptocurrency mining operation. Reiterated “Buy”: Conclusion Overall, I think IREN’s latest quarterly results are quite promising. The only yellow flag is that I see a major CAPEX commitment in Q3, which should pay off nicely in Q4 and 2025. After all, Bitcoin didn’t spike above $90,000 until November 2024. So, those tailwinds will show up in subsequent reports. However, IREN needs to adopt a more prudent capital allocation approach now and focus on riding the Bitcoin wave rather than risking over-expanding. Still, I feel it’s fair to reiterate my “Buy” rating on IREN due to its compelling valuation, forecasted revenue growth, and promising secular tailwinds.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4740873-iris-energy-limited-accelerates-expansion-amid-bitcoin-bull-market?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/36954131.jpeg

Notwithstanding this, ADA is expected to have a strong upward trajectory; analysts project a possible price of $3.10 shortly followed by an amazing $8 in the long run as acceptance and development keep on. Aiming to upend the industry with its creative method of tokenizing real-world assets, Rexas Finance (RXS) is an interesting new competitor that is making noise as a possible alternative to ADA. Rexas Finance is poised to target a startling $18, giving investors a special chance to profit on the next major wave in the blockchain field with its emphasis on generating liquidity in usually illiquid markets. Cardano (ADA): Exhibiting Relentlessness Cardano (ADA) has risen 40% in a week, and its rise appears to be continuing. ADA broke away from historical resistance levels and broke through $1.1, leaving its $0.86–$0.71 range behind and exciting the Cardano community. Investors are now expecting a rise to 3.10 and higher after this outstanding performance. Cardano has been one of the market leaders with a 220% growth in the past month. What drives this rise? Strong technical signs and rising market sentiment. MACD and Moving Averages are bullish, indicating Cardano's momentum will continue. Despite Cardano's 40.49% volatility, 22 of the last 30 days have shown positive price movement. This continuous rise suggests ADA might reach $3.10, with $8 as a long-term aim. Cardano's upward momentum and optimistic expectations show no signs of slowing. Investors should be optimistic since the token could return to its all-time highs before the year ends, giving big gains. Rexas Finance (RXS): Not Stopping until $18 Rexas Finance (RXS) opens the door to the future of asset management, where digital and physical worlds converge to unlock new investment opportunities. Rexas Finance lets users tokenize and digitally own any real-world asset, from real estate to commodities, globally, creating unlimited potential for diverse investments. Rexas Finance is a $0.9 token growing rapidly and will continue till it reaches $18. Both seasoned investors and beginners looking for the next big blockchain opportunity have noticed the platform, which revolutionizes Real World Assets (RWA) tokenization. Since its presale on September 8, 2024, Rexas Finance has made significant progress. With 1 billion RXS tokens, the project has raised all of the $16.25 million target for stage 7 by selling out all of the available 245 million RXS tokens finishing quicker than expected, demonstrating the project's popularity and demand for its novel asset tokenization approach. This is a great opportunity for early investors to participate in a potentially game-changing tokenization solution. The current $1M Giveaway encourages early adopters to join Rexas Finance and share in its success. With the giveaway targeting 20 lucky winners to be rewarded with $50,000 RXS tokens as an incentive for participation, Rexas Finance has groomed its community massively. As the platform grows, its inclusion on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko boosts its reputation and visibility. Rexas Finance's participation in reputable crypto directories helps investors trust the enterprise. The platform's aggressive intentions to be listed on top-tier exchanges, including Rexas Finance (RXS) on one of the Top 3 Tier 1 exchanges, indicate that its growth trajectory is similar to some of the most successful crypto initiatives. Such listings could boost token value due to liquidity and market exposure. Certik, a leading blockchain security firm, audited Rexas Finance's infrastructure to ensure investor safety. This audit reassures investors that the project has been thoroughly examined and fulfills high security and operational transparency criteria. As Rexas Finance gains momentum, its intriguing RWA tokenization use case, targeted expansion efforts, and strong investor support make it an exciting proposition. The platform's presale success and hype suggest this is just the beginning. Rexas Finance is positioned to reach $18 with its creative strategy, huge demand, and secure and trustworthy platform. Early investors may enjoy large returns as the project accelerates. Making a Choice In conclusion, investors may choose Cardano (ADA) or Rexas Finance (RXS), both have benefits and development potential. Due to strong technical indications and market sentiment, Cardano is a safe investment at $3.10 short-term and $8 long-term. Stability, community, and technical support make it a good expansion option. Despite the offerings of Cardano, the next blockchain wave may benefit Rexas Finance investors over Cardano investors. At $18, Rexas Finance's Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization might shake the financial world. A successful presale, rigorous Certik evaluation, and growing community support bode well for the platform.

Significant Investment in Bitcoin SOS Ltd has announced plans to invest $50 million in Bitcoin , marking a significant move toward embracing the cryptocurrency as a strategic asset. The decision, approved by the company's board, reflects a long-term belief in Bitcoin’s role as a store of value. This move aligns with similar actions by global firms looking to capitalize on the evolving cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin as a Strategic Asset SOS operates a Bitcoin mining facility in Wisconsin and has positioned itself as a notable player in the crypto ecosystem. The company noted Bitcoin’s growing appeal, driven by favorable U.S. regulatory developments and increasing adoption. SOS Chairman and CEO Yandai Wang highlighted the cryptocurrency’s robust market performance, bolstered by the launch of Bitcoin-related ETFs and supportive policy shifts. While Bitcoin is currently trading at an average of $93,000 per coin, SOS anticipates its value surpassing $100,000 soon. The investment is part of a broader strategy to drive long-term shareholder value and strengthen the firm’s market position. Market Reaction The announcement significantly impacted SOS’s stock performance. On November 27, shares on the New York Stock Exchange surged by 43%, closing at $9.93, with after-hours trading pushing the price to $11.36. Within 24 hours of the announcement, the stock saw a dramatic 79.5% increase, rising to $12.48. This rally could help offset SOS’s year-to-date losses of 86.5%, a decline that had previously triggered a noncompliance warning from the NYSE. Broader Corporate Trend in Bitcoin SOS’s move is part of a growing trend among corporations to diversify into Bitcoin. Semler Scientific, for instance, recently acquired 297 BTC between November 18 and November 22, bringing its total holdings to 1,570 BTC, valued at $117.8 million. Similarly, video platform Rumble revealed a $20 million Bitcoin purchase on November 25, leading to a 13% boost in its stock price. This wave of corporate Bitcoin acquisitions coincides with shifting U.S. political dynamics. Expectations of a favorable regulatory environment under Donald Trump’s leadership, including potential plans to establish a national Bitcoin reserve, have further fueled interest. Industry leaders suggest these developments could create a regulatory boost, fostering growth in digital asset markets. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Bitcoin all but reached the $100,000 price level, but has been rather volatile since then. Is there more downside to come, or is this just another period of consolidation before Bitcoin shoots much higher? Long-term holders take profits, but a smaller percentage each time For the average retail investor, who perhaps hasn’t been in the Bitcoin trading/investing space very long, a rather difficult decision is perhaps being mulled over. The king of the cryptocurrencies recently reached the incredibly important milestone of $100,000 (or just a couple of hundred dollars short of it). Market wisdom says that these big round figures are likely levels where many investors will be taking profits. Indeed, this has very likely happened. Long-term investors use these landmark levels to sell part of their bags into the huge liquidity that accumulates as these levels are reached. However, be that as it may, long-term holders are selling a smaller percentage of their Bitcoin as time goes on. During the latest price surge long-term holders have sold just less than 4% of their holdings , while in the run-up to the 2017 bull market peak, around 25% of long-term holdings was sold, and in 2021 the figure was 13.4%. Three trendlines in play Source: TradingView The daily chart for $BTC shows that since almost hitting the $100,000 level, the price has generally been going down and sideways for almost a week so far. This is par for the course after hitting such a stand-out price level, and a period of absorption is absolutely to be expected. Three trendlines are currently in play. The first, and shortest trendline, is displaying the down and sideways movement for the last few days. The ascending trendline, taken from 12 November, shows the run-up to the all-time high. This trendline has now been broken, and price is still being rejected from this line. The last trendline, and easily the most important, stretches all the way back to the double top of the last bull market in 2021. It seems that the $BTC price is struggling to definitively get above this trendline, and stay there. The trend is your friend Source: TradingView Zooming out into the 2-week timeframe, it can be observed how the $BTC price had an extremely difficult time to finally break through the old all-time high set at the top of the 2021 bull market. That said, the last 2-week candle was the first to open above the $69,000 horizontal level, and it towers above it, reaching all the way to the ascending trendline. The current 2-week candle is battling with that trendline, plus the psychological $100,000 level. If one looks at the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI is heading up nicely, showing that there is room for a lot more upside. The oft-said market wisdom that “the trend is your friend, until the end” is probably very pertinent here. New traders and investors take heed.

Take SHIBSHOOT, a meme-inspired token in the final stages of its presale, blending gaming elements with community-focused features. However, its long-term success will depend on how well it performs once it’s listed on exchanges. Then there is BlockDAG (BDAG) , a presale project showing clear signs of success by shattering records and setting high expectations. It has recently raised $20 million in just two days, bringing its total presale to over $150 million. Early backers have already enjoyed a remarkable 2240% stake increase, solidifying BlockDAG’s position as the top presale crypto. SHIBSHOOT: Memes Meet Gaming Perks SHIBSHOOT is a meme-inspired cryptocurrency that combines playful visuals with gaming features. It introduces a cowboy-themed Shiba Inu world where users engage in entertaining games while exploring staking and community engagement utilities. While it has gained attention for its creative approach, the project’s true potential depends on its post-presale success. The SHIBSHOOT presale is in its final stages, with 35% of the token supply allocated for early backers. The project aims to launch on both decentralized and centralized exchanges, focusing heavily on marketing and liquidity. Features like “Cactus Staking” allow users to lock tokens for rewards, adding utility to the ecosystem. Despite its unique premise, SHIBSHOOT faces several challenges. Meme-based tokens often struggle to maintain relevance once the initial excitement fades. Additionally, the project’s reliance on its community and gaming features makes it vulnerable to market fluctuations and user engagement drop-offs. BlockDAG: The Biggest Presale in Crypto Market History While meme coins like SHIBSHOOT often gain attention, their rapid rise-and-fall nature pushes serious buyers toward projects offering long-term growth and reliability. That’s where BlockDAG takes the lead. This layer-1 blockchain project is rewriting crypto records by raising $20 million in just two days and bringing its total presale funding to over $150 million. Across just 26 batches BlockDAG has sold more than 16.4 billion BDAG coins. Early backers have already seen their stakes grow by 2240%, as the price surged from an initial $0.001 to $0.0234 in the current batch. This rapid momentum puts BlockDAG on track to achieve its ambitious $600 million target in the coming months, making it the biggest presale of the decade. Market analysts attribute BlockDAG’s rapid presale growth to its unique DAG technology, which has attracted a massive influx of crypto enthusiasts. By leveraging advanced Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology and a robust Proof-of-Work (PoW) mechanism, BlockDAG delivers unmatched scalability, security, and decentralization. These features make it one of the most advanced layer-1 blockchain projects, earning the attention of major exchanges that are already in discussion with BlockDAG for post-presale listings. Once listed on major exchanges, early BDAG holders could see significant gains as major exchange listings enhance liquidity and increase demand, driving the prices higher. Increased accessibility and market activity are expected to amplify BDAG’s value, offering early backers substantial returns. Who Will Win in a Head-to-Head: SHIBSHOOT or BlockDAG? While SHIBSHOOT emphasizes gaming and community engagement, it lacks advanced technological features that could ensure long-term scalability. In contrast, BlockDAG stands out with its innovative Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) architecture and Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus, offering unmatched scalability, security, and decentralization — qualities that make it a far more reliable blockchain project. Similarly, when it comes to future growth, SHIBSHOOT's success largely depends on maintaining hype post-listing, a common challenge for meme-based tokens. On the other hand, BlockDAG is already in discussions with major exchanges — a move expected to enhance liquidity, boost demand, and drive significant price momentum for BDAG holders. Finally, their presale performances tell an even clearer story. SHIBSHOOT has seen moderate success, allocating 35% of its tokens to early backers. However, BlockDAG has raised over $150 million and delivered a staggering 2240% ROI to its early supporters, with its presale only halfway complete. Wrapping Up SHIBSHOOT’s presale is nearing its end, drawing attention with its gaming-centric approach, yet its post-listing performance remains uncertain. However, BlockDAG emerges as the best crypto to buy now for offering substantial long-term returns. BlockDAG’s innovative DAG technology, record-breaking presale success, and ongoing discussions with major exchanges make it a better option for buyers looking for a stable crypto option. BlockDAG has amassed over $150 million in its ongoing presale and delivered a staggering 2240% growth to its early backers, securing its place as the top presale crypto.

Recently, Cardano made headlines by deploying its first zero-knowledge (ZK) smart contract on the mainnet. This groundbreaking development marks the beginning of ZK applications on the Cardano blockchain, opening doors to a range of secure and efficient blockchain functionalities. Zero-knowledge technology is lauded for its ability to verify data without revealing the data itself, making it a game-changer for privacy-centric applications. Expanding Horizons: Bitcoin and DeFi Integration Cardano’s roadmap is not confined to its native blockchain. The platform is venturing into decentralized finance (DeFi) applications with plans to integrate Bitcoin into its ecosystem. Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, envisions a future where users can interact with decentralized applications (dApps) and utilize Bitcoin directly on the platform. This initiative aims to enhance Bitcoin’s utility by introducing features like direct spending through dApps and expanding its potential for use in DeFi. Hoskinson believes this approach could bridge gaps in Bitcoin's current infrastructure while aligning with Cardano’s mission of fostering innovation and accessibility in blockchain technology. By enabling DeFi features on Bitcoin, Cardano aims to empower users with tools that were previously limited to advanced blockchain networks. As the platform continues to develop, the team’s efforts to integrate Bitcoin into its DeFi ecosystem and the successful deployment of ZK smart contracts are a telling sign of the team’s ambition to expand its influence across the cryptocurrency industry. With a focus on community-driven development and technological advancement, Cardano is well-positioned to drive adoption and redefine the future of blockchain. Users and developers are encouraged to explore the new wallet update and provide feedback, ensuring that Cardano remains a blockchain built by and for its community. Cardano Enters the Era of Zero-Knowledge Applications with First ZK Smart Contract Deployment Cardano, one of the leading blockchain networks, has reached a groundbreaking milestone with the deployment of its first zero-knowledge (ZK) smart contract on the mainnet. This achievement, confirmed by Sebastien Guillemot, co-founder of dcSpark, signals the beginning of a new era for the Cardano ecosystem, opening doors to advanced cryptographic capabilities and innovative decentralized applications (dApps). The pioneering ZK smart contract was executed by Cardano’s core development team, Input Output, leveraging Halo 2 technology for ZK verification. Developed by Electric Coin Company, the creators of Zcash, Halo 2 is a cutting-edge zkSNARK proving system that enables the creation and verification of cryptographic proofs without requiring a trusted setup. This makes it an ideal choice for enhancing security and efficiency in blockchain transactions. The first transaction under this new framework was designed to lock funds on the blockchain. A subsequent transaction, which validated the Halo 2-generated ZK proof, was used to unlock these funds. Notably, the unlocking transaction incurred a fee of 2.03 ADA, equivalent to approximately $1.90—a figure Input Output describes as ”reasonably low” for such advanced functionality. Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) are a powerful cryptographic tool that allows one party to prove that a computation was performed correctly without revealing the underlying data. In the context of blockchain, this innovation is transformative, as it provides a mechanism to enhance privacy, scalability, and interoperability without compromising transparency or trust. Input Output highlighted the benefits of Halo 2’s cryptographic capabilities in a detailed social media thread. One standout feature is recursive proofs, which allow complex computations to be divided into smaller, manageable parts. This not only improves scalability by optimizing resource usage but also enhances interoperability by enabling seamless integration with other systems. The deployment of Halo 2 on Cardano marks a significant step toward achieving the blockchain's goals of scalability, efficiency, and security. By integrating zero-knowledge proofs, Cardano is poised to address some of the most pressing challenges in the blockchain industry, including: Scalability: Recursive proofs enable Cardano to handle more extensive and complex computations efficiently, paving the way for mass adoption and support for sophisticated dApps. Privacy: ZKPs allow sensitive data to remain private while still proving the validity of transactions, a crucial feature for industries like finance, healthcare, and supply chain management. Interoperability: The modular nature of computations facilitated by ZKPs can enhance collaboration between Cardano and other blockchain networks. “This test by IO Research represents a significant step forward in the use of zero-knowledge proofs with Cardano, bringing with it a powerful combination of scalability, efficiency, and further enhanced security,” Input Output stated. While acknowledging the milestone, the team also emphasized that further work lies ahead to fully realize the potential of ZK technology on Cardano. What This Means for Cardano’s Ecosystem The integration of ZK technology on Cardano’s mainnet is expected to catalyze a wave of innovation within its ecosystem. Developers can now explore new use cases for dApps that leverage ZKPs for privacy-preserving operations, complex computations, and cross-chain collaborations. This move also strengthens Cardano’s position as a leading blockchain network equipped to meet the demands of next-generation applications. While this milestone is monumental, it is only the beginning for Cardano in its journey to harness the full potential of zero-knowledge technology. The team at Input Output has expressed its push to refine and expand the capabilities of ZKPs on the platform. As the ecosystem evolves, further innovations are anticipated, potentially transforming Cardano into a hub for privacy-centric and scalable decentralized applications. As Cardano continues to break new ground with zero-knowledge proofs, its community and stakeholders can look forward to a future of enhanced functionality, security, and interoperability. This achievement not only elevates Cardano’s status within the blockchain industry but also serves as a strong indication of its role in shaping the next generation of decentralized technology.",POSITIVE,ADA,ADA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | TECHNOLOGY | ZK,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6293/cardano-enhances-light-wallet-functionality-with-lace-1-17-5,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

ADA ranks 9th on CoinMarketCap with a market capitalization above $35 billion based on its live price of $1.00 and strong 24-hour trading volume of over $3.3 billion as of writing. The most recent discussion, meanwhile, is not only about ADA's present movement—which has witnessed a 4.20% rise in the past 24 hours. Rather, rumors around the crypto community imply that the whales are focusing on a potential new competitor called Rexas Finance (RXS). Rexas Finance is a revolution not only another crypto endeavour. Listed on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, it is generating buzz in its presale and presents an early chance for investors to own a piece of what might be the next major blockchain technology trend as it targets a price of $13 in 2025. Why Big Investors Are Eyeing Rexas Finance (RXS) Rexas Finance is in its expansion stage; hence, it is ready for exponential increases, unlike Cardano, which has found a position in the crypto hierarchy. Currently at presale stage 7 price priced at $0.090; RXS has already raised an amazing $15,263,923 by selling over 234,041,322 tokens as of writing. By early 2025 the token will be launched at $0.20; analysts estimate an aggressive surge to $13 in the same year, a startling 14,344% rise from its present presale price. What then is fueling this great promise? The Rexas Finance Edge 1. Transformational Real-World Asset Tokenizing By letting anyone tokenize real-world assets ( RWAs), including real estate, gold, art, and collectibles, Rexas Finance is bridging the gap between traditional finance and blockchain. With real estate alone valued at $379.7 trillion, the worldwide market for these assets is $500 trillion. Using blockchain, Rexas Finance enables simple buying, selling, and fractionalizing of these assets. 2. Creative Ecosystemacy The platform consists of a set of innovative instruments: Token Builder: Simplify asset tokenizing free from code.

Community-Driven Approach Unlike most crypto initiatives that mostly rely on venture finance, Rexas Finance has adopted a community-centric approach and attracted a committed investor base fit for its goal. This approach guarantees sustainability and value over the long run. 4. Certified Audited Tier 1 Exchange Listings Above all, credibility and security rule. Set to open on three of the top ten tier-1 exchanges, Rexas Finance has passed a thorough Certik audit. This assures a solid basis for liquidity and post-launch trade. The Time to Act is Now Rising from its initial presale price of $0.030 to its current $0.090 - a 200% rise, Rexas Finance has shown an amazing trajectory. The price moves closer to its launch value of $0.20 with every stage of the presale, giving limited time for astute investors to grab RXS at a bargain. More importantly, Rexas Finance is running an ongoing $1 million RXS giveaway with 20 lucky winners slated to get $50,000 worth of RXS each. By finishing tasks on the Rexas Finance website, participants increase their chances of winning large before the presale ends. Although Cardano is still a steady and trustworthy investment, its present value shows a more developed phase of expansion. For those looking for early-stage, high-growth potential, Rexas Finance offers an unmatched chance, nevertheless. With its lofty target of a $52 billion market cap by 2025, RXS might soon challenge and maybe overtake Cardano's ranking in the crypto charts. Conclusion: Don’t Miss the RXS Presale The crypto industry evolves quickly, and those who act early usually reap the largest benefits. Big-money investors are already turning from known giants like Cardano to the unrealized promise of Rexas Finance. With forecasts pointing to a launch price of $0.20 and a possible ascent to $13 by 2025, RXS offers an easily available entrance point for investors at just $0.090. Rexas Finance offers a chance to ride the wave of invention and expansion regardless of your level of knowledge about cryptocurrencies or seasoned trading. Secure your RXS immediately and start the revolution before the token opens on tier-1 exchanges. Rexas Finance marks the future of blockchain here.

The company, which operates a Bitcoin mining facility in Wisconsin, stated that its board approved the move as part of its strategy to position Bitcoin as a core asset in its portfolio. In an official statement , SOS chairman and CEO Yandai Wang stated Bitcoin’s growing significance as a “store of value and a strategic asset,” citing recent market resilience and favorable regulatory shifts in the United States. The firm plans to use strategies such as arbitrage and trading to optimize returns while managing price volatility. The announcement caused SOS Ltd (SOS) shares to jump 43% by the close of trading, reaching $9.93. After-hours trading extended the gains by another 14.5%, with the stock climbing to $11.36. A Turnaround Amidst a Troubled Year This boost comes as a rare bright spot in an otherwise challenging year for SOS. The company’s stock has plummeted by 86.5% in 2024, prompting a noncompliance warning from the New York Stock Exchange in August. The stock’s current performance pales in comparison to its all-time high of $84,900 in October 2017. SOS Ltd’s bold Bitcoin play follows a trend among firms looking to capitalize on the cryptocurrency’s extraordinary rally. Bitcoin surged approximately 40% in November, hitting a high of $99,860 on Coinbase on November 24. Recent market enthusiasm has been driven by developments such as the launch of Bitcoin-related ETFs and improving regulatory clarity in the U.S. digital asset sector. Industry-Wide Bitcoin Moves Gain Traction SOS Ltd isn’t the only company pivoting to Bitcoin to bolster its fortunes. On November 25, video platform Rumble announced a $20 million Bitcoin purchase , which sent its stock up nearly 13%. Similarly, Genius Group, an education provider integrating artificial intelligence, allocated $10 million to Bitcoin earlier this month and revealed plans to hold up to 90% of its reserves in the cryptocurrency. Despite these bold moves, critics remain cautious, highlighting the risks associated with market volatility and the challenges of profitability. For SOS, its Bitcoin gamble could either mark the beginning of a turnaround or add another chapter to its ongoing struggles. As Bitcoin price continues to hover near $100,000 , the growing institutional interest underscores the cryptocurrency’s evolving role in corporate strategies. However, only time will reveal whether these high-stakes investments will pay off.

Accordingly, the GOAT Network team announced that it will soon allow Dogecoin (DOGE) users to stake their tokens to earn fixed BTC returns. According to Coindesk, GOAT will soon offer Dogecoin investors the opportunity to earn fixed returns in BTC by staking DOGE. The team also noted that they are planning additional memecoin-based financial applications in the future, allowing users to earn “even bigger rewards” in their DOGE holdings. The GOAT Network team said Dogecoin was chosen because of its long, colorful, and highly successful history, as well as its strong community feel and bullish outlook after being named after a U.S. government agency called DOGE. “Dogecoin investors can withstand the volatility of the cryptocurrency without having to sell off DOGE on paper before the time is up, and in the process, earn Bitcoin – digital gold that is now being adopted by companies, institutions and nation states. That's why we added Dogecoin to our rapidly growing ecosystem.” The GOAT Network, whose mainnet has not yet been released, operates by allowing users to lock up BTC and earn network rewards, a process popularly referred to as staking. The price of Dogecoin has increased by 145% in the last month due to the virality of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a non-governmental organization with links to Elon Musk. *This is not investment advice.

Qubetics Could Turn $200 Into $195K, Litecoin’s 73-Day Whale Buying Spree and Monero’s $460 Future","In today’s crypto market, staying ahead of trends can feel like navigating a maze. With new developments happening every day, the challenge is finding which projects are truly worth your attention. While seasoned favourites continue to grab headlines, a groundbreaking player is quietly making waves. Recently, Litecoin’s whale activity and Monero’s consistent privacy-focused approach have been drawing interest. But there’s a rising star in the crypto world you need to know about: Qubetics ($TICS). With its game-changing virtual card feature and an electrifying presale, this project is shaping up to be the best crypto to hold now. This article will unpack everything you need to know about Qubetics, Litecoin, and Monero, with a special spotlight on why $TICS might just be the gem you’re searching for. Qubetics: Redefining Crypto with Virtual Card Convenience Qubetics isn’t just another cryptocurrency; it’s redefining digital finance. One standout feature is its Qubetics Wallet, which is equipped with virtual card functionality. Imagine being able to generate a virtual card right from the app. That card could then be used for seamless online transactions, just like your everyday debit or credit card—but with extra layers of convenience and security. This isn’t just about making payments easier. Virtual cards within the Qubetics Wallet allow users to monitor, manage, and deactivate cards instantly if needed . That level of control protects your main payment methods while offering unparalleled flexibility. Whether you’re shopping online or subscribing to services, Qubetics puts the power back in your hands. With innovation like this, it’s no wonder why crypto enthusiasts are calling Qubetics the best crypto to hold now. Litecoin: Whales and a Price Tumble Litecoin’s recent performance has been a rollercoaster. On Tuesday, the coin dropped below $88, marking a sharp 17% decline from its high of $106 on November 23. Despite the drop, Litecoin whales have been busy, recording 73 consecutive days of positive net inflows. During this buying spree, they acquired a whopping 13.2 million LTC worth $946.6 million. Even though the price slipped, the long-term sentiment seems optimistic, especially with the departure of SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who recently boosted the market. Whales clearly see Litecoin as one of the best cryptos, banking on its future recovery. Monero: The Privacy King Holds Strong Monero (XMR) continues to stand out as a leader in crypto privacy. This blockchain anonymizes transactions, making it nearly impossible to trace. It’s perfect for users who demand high-level anonymity. Despite facing regulatory hurdles and delistings, Monero maintains a market cap of $2.9 billion with a token supply of 18.45 million coins. Price predictions for Monero are equally promising. Analysts suggest it could hit $180 by 2025 and $460 by 2030. For those looking for a long-term bet on privacy and security, Monero might be the best crypto to hold now. Its resilience against bans and advanced security features ensure it remains a favourite for many. Why Qubetics Is the Talk of the Town? Presale Phase 10 of Qubetics ($TICS) is heating up, and there’s plenty of reason to get excited. Here’s the deal: Qubetics is selling tokens at $0.025 each, and over $3.4 million has already been raised. The token price increases by 10% every week, with the final phase bringing a 20% hike. Translation? Early investors are set to reap massive rewards. Let’s break this down: A $200 investment at today’s price would net you 8,000 $TICS tokens. If $TICS hits $10 in the future, your investment skyrockets to $80,000—a jaw-dropping 43,000% ROI. If it climbs to $15 per token, $200 will balloon to an eye-watering $195,000, yielding a 39,900% ROI. Numbers like these make Qubetics a strong contender for the best crypto to hold now . The presale is moving fast, so waiting could mean missing out on what might just be the year’s most exciting investment opportunity. Will you be part of the next big crypto success story? Conclusion: Qubetics, Litecoin, and Monero—What’s Next? Each of these coins offers something unique. Litecoin’s whale activity signals long-term potential, and Monero’s focus on privacy ensures a dedicated user base. But Qubetics ($TICS) stands out as the best crypto to hold now for those seeking innovation, growth, and opportunity. With its virtual card feature and an electrifying presale, Qubetics is capturing the imagination of savvy investors. The crypto market moves fast, and fortunes favour the bold. If you’re ready to ride the wave, consider jumping into Qubetics’ presale before it’s too late. The future of finance is here—will you seize it? Don’t wait; the next phase starts soon!

36953534,https://thecoinrise.com/best-altcoin-to-buy-this-week-qubetics-blows-away-minds/,1732797035,Best Altcoin to Buy this Week: Qubetics Blows Away Minds,"Investors Look for the Best Altcoin to Buy this Week As Qubetics Tokenised Marketplace Blows Away Minds As Tron And Algorand Gain Attention Have you ever wondered how tokenized marketplaces could transform the way we invest? Qubetics addresses a pressing gap in the blockchain space by introducing a robust, user-friendly tokenized marketplace. Traditional markets often face illiquidity and a lack of transparency, leaving many investors frustrated. Without tokenization, high-value investment opportunities are limited to an elite few. This is where Qubetics’ marketplace shines, enabling fractional ownership and increased liquidity. Furthermore, Qubetics prioritises regulatory compliance, making it a reliable platform for both beginners and seasoned investors. Analysts are buzzing about Qubetics’ potential. Its presale is already a massive success, with over $3.4M raised and 231 million tokens sold. Current token holders exceed 4,500, showing the growing trust in this project. At a stage 10 presale price of $0.025, this altcoin is turning heads as one of the best altcoins to buy this week . Predictions suggest a price surge to $10-15 post-mainnet launch, offering a golden opportunity for those eager to invest in cutting-edge blockchain solutions. The Demand for Tokenized Marketplaces: Why Qubetics Stands Out Qubetics is a new and exciting project that aims to solve some big problems in the crypto world. It offers a tokenized marketplace where users can buy and sell digital assets in a secure and transparent way. One of the main issues Qubetics addresses is the lack of liquidity and transparency in traditional markets. Many investors find it hard to access high-value investment opportunities, but Qubetics makes it easier for everyone by allowing fractional ownership. This means more people can get involved in valuable assets without needing huge amounts of money. Qubetics is also working on creating a decentralized VPN (dVPN) to protect your online privacy. This is important because many online services track and sell your data. With Qubetics’ dVPN, you can surf the internet safely and privately, without worrying about your information being exposed. The presale for Qubetics is doing great, with over 4,500 token holders and more than $3.4 million raised. Experts predict that Qubetics could be worth $10-15 after the mainnet launch, making it one of the best altcoins to buy right now. Qubetics Presale: Your Opportunity to Join Early Qubetics’ presale is rewriting the rules of early-stage crypto investments. At stage 10, the token price is $0.025, offering an accessible entry point for new and experienced investors alike. With over 231 million tokens sold and $3.4M raised, the project’s traction speaks volumes about its potential. More than 4,500 investors have already joined, recognising Qubetics as one of the best altcoins to buy this week . Analysts predict a price explosion to $10-15 post-mainnet launch, driven by its innovative tokenized marketplace and growing ecosystem. If you’re looking for a groundbreaking project with real-world applications, Qubetics is an opportunity you shouldn’t overlook. Tron’s USDT Boom: A Game-Changer in Stablecoin Transactions Tron continues to be a leader in the blockchain world, especially in stablecoin transactions. Recently, Tether minted an astounding $1 billion in USDT on Tron’s network. What’s even more remarkable is that these transactions were processed without fees, showcasing Tron’s efficiency. This development cements Tron’s reputation as a reliable network for decentralised finance (DeFi) solutions. With its rapid scalability and strong developer ecosystem, Tron is not just surviving but thriving in the competitive blockchain space. For investors looking for a stable and high-performing altcoin, Tron remains a contender for the best altcoin to buy this week. Its consistent innovations and focus on transaction efficiency set it apart in a crowded market. Algorand’s Green Blockchain and Long-Term Potential Algorand has long been a favourite for its environmentally friendly blockchain technology. By offering a carbon-neutral approach, it aligns with the growing demand for sustainable crypto solutions. Analysts believe Algorand’s infrastructure will play a crucial role in future blockchain scalability. With a secure and efficient system, Algorand is well-positioned to compete with top-tier cryptos. Recently, comparisons between Algorand and Cardano have sparked debates about which is the better investment. While Cardano offers research-backed solutions, Algorand focuses on speed and sustainability. This dual focus makes it an attractive choice for investors looking for long-term growth potential. Its place as one of the best altcoins to buy this week is further strengthened by its market stability and developer-friendly platform. The Key Takeaway In conclusion, Qubetics is shaping up to be one of the most promising projects in the crypto space. With its tokenized marketplace and decentralized VPN, it addresses key issues like illiquidity, lack of transparency, and online privacy. As the presale continues to gain momentum, it’s clear that Qubetics has huge potential for growth.

Miners' biggest challenge is revenue. The reward they receive for confirming blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain was cut 50% in April, when their combined market cap was about $20 billion. In this current epoch, only 450 bitcoin are mined a day and fees paid to miners remain at cycle lows, just 10 BTC ($946,000) on Nov. 27 according to Glassnode data.      That means they either have to diversify revenue streams or produce bitcoin at a cheaper cost than the spot price, currently about $96,000.  That's a challenge that is about to become more difficult. The mining difficulty, which measures how hard it is to produce the blockchain's blocks, is expected to increase by a further 3% at some point in the next few days.  Mining difficulty, already firmly above 1 trillion, automatically adjusts every 2016 blocks or roughly every two weeks. The higher the difficulty, the harder — and costlier — for miners to produce a new block.    The heart of the issue is the soaring hashrate, which has held above 700 exahash per second (EH/s) for more than a month. The hashrate is the computational power required to mine and process transactions on a proof-of-work blockchain like Bitcoin.  On a seven-day moving average, the hashrate is currently at 726 EH/s, continuing to put in higher highs and higher lows since mid-year, according to Glassnode data.    In 2024, many miners have diversified their revenue streams by pivoting into the AI and high-performance computing (HPC) industries, where there is soaring demand for locations that can host the computing power they need.   One example is IREN (IREN), whose shares surged 30% on Wednesday on renewed AI interest.  Other, such as MARA Holdings (MARA), are leveraging their bitcoin stashes and bumping up their bitcoin balance sheet holdings. As of Nov. 27, MARA added a further 703 BTC after selling a 0% $1 billion convertible note to raise the funds. The company now owns a total 34,794 BTC.  The CoinShares Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF is a proxy for publicly traded miners. Its share price is up 60% year-to-date, which is underperforming bitcoin's 113%.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING,James Van Straten,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/11/28/bitcoin-miners-approach-40-b-market-cap-as-difficulty-set-for-fifth-straight-increase,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/621a7e00d26515615073001d3c97123324394f4b-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
36956871,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=103117,1732796612,"Analyst Says If You Hold XRP, You Will Be Very Rich Soon","Crypto analyst Robert Doyle, better known as Crypto Sensei, has made bold predictions about XRP, claiming that anyone holding the asset could experience massive wealth soon. In a recent video , Doyle highlighted XRP’s recent surge past a critical 7-year resistance level as a key indicator of its potential for explosive growth. He emphasized that XRP's market momentum, combined with growing institutional adoption, makes it one of the most promising assets in the crypto space.According to Doyle, one of the biggest catalysts for XRP’s rise is the ongoing transition in global financial systems. He pointed out that Ripple has secured major partnerships with several Latin American banks, positioning XRP as a leader in cross-border payments. Furthermore, he discussed theories suggesting that the FedNow payment system could use XRP for instant transactions via various partners. However, this remains unsubstantiated .Doyle also examined broader trends in the cryptocurrency market, including growing institutional interest in crypto and the shift toward tokenized value. Moreover, he spoke about the increasing likelihood of a gold-backed currency system, with XRP serving as the bridge for these new gold-backed assets.Becoming “Very Rich” with XRPWith growing global acceptance and expanding use cases across various sectors, Crypto Sensei believes that XRP is on the verge of a massive rally, and those holding the token are in for significant gains.Specifically, he speculated that if XRP could capture just 4-5% of the global financial market, the value of XRP could skyrocket to $30 or even $50. Notably, XRP is worth $1.48 today, boasting a seven-day growth of 33%.Reaching $30, as Doyle suggested, requires a growth of 1,927%, which is nearly 20X for those buying XRP today. Meanwhile, the upper target of $50 suggests a more promising 3,278% upside. Other commentators, like Wall Street analyst Linda Jones, have made similar projections for XRP , citing a recurring four-year cycle pattern. In this case, $1,000 committed to XRP today could amount to $33,783 with $50 per token.While this prospect seems promising, some analysts have dismissed the possibility of XRP seeing such growth in this current cycle. Conservative analysts have projected that XRP’s destination for this cycle is around $5 to anything below $10.",POSITIVE,XRP,FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | XRP | ZRX,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/28/analyst-says-if-you-hold-xrp-you-will-be-very-rich-soon/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=analyst-says-if-you-hold-xrp-you-will-be-very-rich-soon,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

The former CFTC Chair is known as “Crypto Dad,” thanks to his progressive views on digital assets. Ripple’s Fight Against The SEC Coming To An End? Ripple’s lengthy legal battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission has seen significant developments after Gary Gensler confirmed he was stepping down. Speculation of the case being dropped entirely under new leadership has grown significantly. The lawsuit dates back to December 2020, when the SEC accused Ripple and its executives of illegally raising $1.3 billion through an unregistered securities offering by selling its native cryptocurrency, XRP. However, there is renewed optimism of a resolution after Donald Trump’s presidential win. The president-elect had promised to fire Gensler on his first day in office. These developments led to a substantial jump in the price of XRP, with speculation growing that the legal battle would be resolved under Gensler’s successor. Former CFTC Chair Chris Giancarlo said the SEC may drop the case against Ripple under the Trump administration. “I would recommend that regulatory agencies drop many of these cases where they’ve lost. I think they should drop the XRP case. I would bet that they would.” The former CFTC Chair has previously argued that XRP should not be classified as a security. This view aligns with a July 2023 ruling by Judge Torres, which found certain XRP transactions did not qualify as securities sales. Giancarlo has been highly critical of Gensler’s leadership and has pointed at high turnover, diminished morale, and overreach in enforcement action. Giancarlo supports the creation of a “crypto council” to ensure a coordinated, strategic approach to crypto policy under the Trump administration. He also proposed a list of potential candidates for the SEC leadership, including Paul Atkins and Kevin Hassett, who, according to him, will bring expertise and a commitment to innovation. Potential Scenarios Attorneys Jeremy Hogan and Fred Rispoli discussed potential scenarios for the legal battle between Ripple and the SEC under new leadership. Hogan believes the commission may dismiss all non-fraud crypto lawsuits over the years. He also believes Ripple and the SEC will settle the lawsuit for the previously ruled $125 million. Hogan stated, “It would be awkward to settle for less than what was already decided by a court. The Coinbase and other cases in litigation will simply be dismissed. This will take some time, not January, but before Summer. That’s my call, and I’m sticking to it.” Meanwhile, Rispoli believes dropping the lawsuit is unrealistic and said the $125 million penalty is the biggest win the SEC can get. He also predicted the SEC’s new leadership will recognize the “case was idiotic and settle at that point.” “This might include a reduction in the fine and an agreement that current sales of XRP by Ripple are sufficiently structured to not be investment contracts.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The firm will use the funds to buy more Bitcoin for its treasury management. In a Nov. 28 press release , the Japanese investment firm announced its plans to issue its 12th Stock Acquisition Rights to EVO FUND, an investment management firm in the Cayman Islands, through a third-party allotment starting Dec. 16, 2024. Metaplanet will be issuing a total of 29,000 units. Each unit entitles EVO FUND to purchase 100 common shares. Each subscription right costs 614 yen, resulting in a total issuance price of 17,806,000 yen. If EVO FUND decides to purchase all the units offered by Metaplanet, they will acquire 2,900,000 common shares with a lower exercise price limit of 1,500 yen. Therefore, Metaplanet stands to gain more than 9,5 billion yen ($62 million) from their 12th Stock Acquisition Rights sale to EVO FUND.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Amid the current bull run, Rexas Finance and four other tokens are set to redefine crypto profits in the coming months. Table of Contents Rexas Finance: Reshaping the future of asset tokenization Hedera: Enterprise blockchain solution provider Polkadot: A multi-chain innovator Cardano: Scaling new heights Toncoin: Bridging messaging and blockchain Conclusion Cryptocurrency is experiencing a lot of excitement, and if users wish to invest about $744, this investment can be turned into 740 times its value through these five tokens in the next few months. These tokens include Rexas Finance, Hedera, Polkadot, Cardano, and Toncoin. Over time, these cryptocurrencies will prove to be profitable, and here’s why each can provide attractive returns in the coming months. Rexas Finance: Reshaping the future of asset tokenization Pragmatically, Rexas Finance , currently trading at $0.090, is perhaps the first company able to deliver on real-world asset tokenization using an advanced technological stack dealing with the digital domain. RXS is a global asset tokenization platform that enables its users to create real estate tokens, fine art tokens, and other assets that can act as a bridge between traditional investment markets and blockchain. RXS has raised $15,374,225 and sold 235,027,252 tokens across its presale stages, with thousands showing interest in the market. The ecosystem powering RXS includes: Rexas Token Builder: A simpler way to build users’ own blockchain token without any technical know-how. Rexas Launchpad: A safe and trustless environment for token sales without any central restriction. Rexas GenAI: An artificial intelligence-based creation of NFTs and digital art for monetization by true creators. Rexas DeFi: Supporting swaps across various exchanges and decentralized cryptocurrency trading. Rexas Treasury: Enabling investors to accumulate more assets from compounding interest. Rexas Finance is listed on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko and is CertiK audited, ensuring security and transparency. At a scheduled launch price of $0.20, early investors stand to benefit with 122% returns at launch. The model behind it and its real-world application make RXS essential for anyone looking to make serious returns. You might also like: Rexas Finance poised to be future of RWA tokenization: Fourth presale stage ends earlier than predicted Hedera: Enterprise blockchain solution provider Hedera , currently priced at $0.143793, is a winner with its enterprise-level blockchain technology. Its Applicative Chain and HBAR work on a unique hash graph consensus mechanism, giving Hedera great speed, scalability, and energy efficiency—perfect for businesses and developers alike. From supply chain management to DeFi, HBAR is finding its way into various sectors, and its partnerships with corporations have boosted its position. With the low level of institutional adoption seen so far, Hedera could experience significant price gains in the coming months. Polkadot: A multi-chain innovator DOT is currently at $9.20. Because of the recent para chain auctions where different developers are deploying their dot assets, Polkadot adoption is likely to grow along with the appreciation in its value. In due time, however, it is expected to reach its full potential because it will be one of the leading platforms in creating connections between blockchain networks. Cardano: Scaling new heights Cardano is currently valued at $1.04. It is a research-based blockchain platform that follows a systematic approach to development. ADA is known for its scalability, sustainability, and security, attracting both developers and investors. Recent upgrades, including the Hydra scaling solution, aim to increase transaction speed and lower transaction costs, improving Cardano’s appeal to DeFi and NFT use cases. With broader adoption and active community support, ADA has strong potential for a breakout rally. Toncoin: Bridging messaging and blockchain Toncoin is priced at $6.13. It is the native token of The Open Network, originally sponsored by Telegram. TON stands out for its integration with messaging services, enabling users to perform crypto transactions within the app. Its focus on ease of use and accessibility has made it popular among retail investors. Given Telegram’s vast audience and the network’s developments, Toncoin has the potential for significant valuation growth in the near future. Conclusion While all these tokens have inherent strengths, Rexas Finance makes the strongest investment case. With its ambition to tokenize real-world assets and its solid ecosystem, RXS is more than a cryptocurrency—it is a groundbreaking platform. The successful presale of RXS, its CertiK audit, and the upcoming listing at $0.20 suggest strong growth potential with low risk.

36952440,https://crypto.news/?p=14313974,1732795680,Rethinking energy storage with Bitcoin mining | Opinion,"Disclosure: The views and opinions expressed here belong solely to the author and do not represent the views and opinions of crypto.news’ editorial. Energy generation is a great thing for humanity. The famous astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev went as far as considering energy generation as the one factor to evaluate how advanced a civilization is. So, when we hear that the AI industry is projected to consume around 120 GW by 2030 or that Bitcoin ( BTC ) mining is estimated to be currently consuming around 17.6 GW globally, we may actually consider these as signs of advancement and progress. You might also like: Bhutan’s path to economic self-reliance is Bitcoin mining | Opinion During the past decade, there has been a strong push towards renewable energy production, with entrepreneurs such as Elon Musk driving the world towards electrification. But, because there is no silver bullet in the energy industry, it’s necessary to diversify solutions rather than putting all of the eggs in one basket. For years, I’ve been making the case that Bitcoin mining is synergetic to green energy production development and can be considered as a form of energy storage that can help facilitate the energy transition we are going through, creating a world of greater energy abundance. The importance of storing energy When it comes to electrification, batteries are often the elephant in the room. It’s no secret that the energy storage required to keep up with the surge in electric vehicles and renewable energy facilities is a great concern for many in the industry. And while there are several methods, such as hydroelectric or geothermal storage, are available, these often depend on specific conditions, which is why batteries are an increasingly common energy storage solution. To understand the issue, it’s worth understanding the problem that energy storage solves. When electricity is produced using renewable energy instead of fossil fuels, there is often a mismatch between consumer and industrial demand and the supply of electricity because sources of energy such as wind and solar are not constant. Specifically, wind energy often peaks at night, solar power is naturally strongest during the day, and both are inevitably dependent on weather conditions. This problem is called intermittency, and currently, the best way to solve it is through energy storage solutions such as batteries. Think about a household with solar panels that produces larger amounts of electricity in the middle of the day when everyone is at work or school but produces almost nothing in the evening when the television, the AC, the oven, and other appliances are on. That’s why households with solar panels usually store the excess electricity using a battery—typically a lithium-ion one. Understanding batteries: What should we know? When we look at the total battery storage capacity in the United States, it’s evident that the increase in production and utilization is happening at an exponential rate, with 30 GW expected to be reached in capacity by the end of this year and a staggering 970 GW estimated to be reached by 2030, according to the US Energy Information Administration. Today’s batteries generally provide power for only a short duration before requiring a recharge. Some companies are working on advanced battery solutions that can store energy for over 12 hours. Another way to extend storage duration is by adding more batteries to facilities, but this approach can face economic challenges. States such as California and Texas have been amassing large amounts of batteries to keep up with the increase in renewable energy. Electricity is stored during moments of low demand and distributed through the electric grid during peak hours. However, due to the current limitations of battery technology, additional long-duration grid balancing solutions remain essential—and Bitcoin mining could help address this challenge. A profitable and flexible energy load or balancing system Bitcoin miners are location-agnostic, meaning that they can conduct their operations anywhere in the world, be it near an urban area or at a remote facility, as long as the operational costs can be covered. All a local miner really needs is electricity and an internet connection. Secondly, Bitcoin miners enjoy a great degree of flexibility, allowing them to turn their machines off and then back on without incurring costs other than the marginal loss of profit during that time period. This means that the machines can be turned off during a moment of need—such as peak hours or a winter storm that damages the energy grid—and can be turned on during moments of low demand when the electricity produced would either be wasted or stored into batteries. This flexible load helps to stabilize the grid and eventually grow the share of green energy sources in the grid. Texas is a great example of how a regional operator, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, works with Bitcoin miners to stabilize the energy grid. Bitcoin miners adjust their energy consumption in real time, which allows ERCOT to balance supply and demand more effectively to manage peak periods. With Bitcoin mining, electric service providers can monetize their unused electricity from renewable energy sources without only having to rely on batteries, which ultimately results in greater efficiency. This is a paradigm shift because unused energy goes from being a cost or a missed profit to an additional source of revenue. This, in turn, can lead to more investments in renewable energy sources that ultimately benefit the consumer. Getting the policies right In this context, local public authorities might soon try new policies that consider Bitcoin mining as a public good and an alternative form of energy production to be incentivized. This can create very interesting synergies between batteries and Bitcoin mining, especially given the fact the latter generates numerous local jobs, fosters regional economies by working with local suppliers and contractors, and often repurposes abandoned infrastructure for its operations. While recent developments put Bitcoin mining and the broader industry in a good position from a policy perspective, there is still a lot of work to be done in educating decision-makers. Once these grid-stabilizing and green energy production support properties become clearer to both national and local regulators, there will be a massive opportunity to improve the energy sector. By providing unprecedented flexibility and monetization opportunities for energy producers, Bitcoin mining presents a novel and effective way to approach energy production, grid stabilization, and battery storage during a time when the deployment of batteries is growing at an unprecedented rate. By leveraging the unique aspects of Bitcoin mining, including its location agnosticism and operational flexibility, we can enhance the integration of additional renewable energy production more effectively than ever. Policymakers must recognize the potential of Bitcoin mining as part of their energy strategy. Only by experimenting and diversifying will we be able to build a more resilient and sustainable energy future.

36952956,https://timestabloid.com/?p=50887,1732795483,"Solana Could Double Your $400 in the Next 100 Days, Cardano May Triple It, But One SOL & ADA Competitor Will Grow it 34x","Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA), for the longest potential altcoins to invest in, have the potential to provide returns that go two or three times over in a few months. Enter the new challenger though: Rexas Finance (RXS) which has pushed its way into the forefront with its new tokenization of assets and financing methods. Rexas Finance’s investment ecosystem is a complete game changer, and its growing market is expected to enhance ROI significantly, with projections indicating that a $400 investment may grow 34-fold in 100 days. For those trying to stay ahead of the curve, RXS could be the next big cryptocurrency to watch. Rexas Finance (RXS): Primed for 34X Reward Rexas Finance is primed to provide exceptional gains, with analysts expecting a 34x return on a $400 investment within the next 100 days. At the heart of this fast growth is its groundbreaking approach to blockchain-based asset tokenization, which converts illiquid assets such as real estate and commodities into tradable digital tokens, offering ordinary investors fractional ownership. This idea connects to the huge $486 trillion worldwide market for tokenized assets, providing a simple and democratized approach to access high-potential opportunities. Rexas Finance is now priced at $0.09 in its presale and has already raised over $15.1 million, completing six presale stages ahead of schedule, with the next stage slated to raise the price to $0.09. Once launched on tier-1 exchanges for $0.20, early investors are promised an instant 6x return, with analysts predicting a parabolic surge to an astonishing p increase from its initial price. The project’s Certik audit provides strong security and trust, while its listings on CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap increase its visibility in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Coupled with a $1 million giveaway to encourage community participation, Rexas Finance has laid a solid basis for quick expansion. Rexas Finance, with its combination of cutting-edge technology, significant milestones, and a developing ecosystem, serves as a beacon for investors looking for a 34X reward for investment in the token in less than 100 days. Cardano (ADA): A Token For Tripling an Investment Charles Hoskinson’s leadership has propelled the development of Cardano (ADA), which is now gaining ground thanks to decisive advancements. Furthermore, Donald Trump’s support of Cardano and the project’s recent announcement of a partnership with Ripple to develop the Midnight sidechain will help Cardano gain rapid acceptance. The recent release of its new bridge technology has enhanced Bitcoin’s security, propelling ADA’s price to new heights, with a phenomenal 151% growth in just one month. As Bitcoin approaches the $100,000 level, ADA is closely following suit, with record-breaking trade volumes and a strong market outlook. Experts believe that the window for purchasing ADA at $0.85 is rapidly closing, as the price may shortly go through the $2 threshold. For investors hoping to profit on the next wave of growth, now is the time to position yourself before Cardano potentially triples your $400 investment over the next 100 days. Solana (SOL): Good Enough to Double Your Investment Solana (SOL) is presenting itself as a potent force capable of doubling a $400 investment in the following 100 days. The game-changing moment occurred on November 21, when the US District Court for the Northern District of Texas limited the SEC’s overreach, triggering an 8% increase in SOL’s value in just six hours, propelling it beyond $254. This legal victory has boosted Bitwise’s campaign for SEC approval of a SOL ETF, which coincided with SOL reaching an all-time high of $260. Beyond the headlines, Solana is making ripples on-chain, becoming the most popular blockchain on Nansen, while DeFi activity on the network has exploded, increasing the network’s total value locked (TVL) to $8.67 billion. Solana is currently trading 68.2% above its 200-day SMA of $150.9 and has had 18 bullish days in the previous 30 days, with important resistance levels at $260 and $330. As SOL continues to dominate with soaring utility and unwavering community support, its trajectory implies not only growth but also a thunderous leap for investors looking to capitalize on the opportunity. Conclusion Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA) have appealing potential for doubling or triple investments, thanks to their powerful ecosystems and strategic breakthroughs. However, Rexas Finance (RXS) stands out as a game changer because to its novel approach to asset tokenization, which is expected to yield remarkable 34x returns. By bridging the gap between real-world assets and blockchain technology, RXS is reinventing investing opportunities and outperforming traditional tokens. For individuals looking to optimize growth and stay ahead of the crypto industry, Rexas Finance offers an unprecedented opportunity with revolutionary potential.

36952269,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=105285,1732795301,Moongate Launches $MGT Token to Drive New Era of Engagement in the Attention Economy,"Hong Kong, Hong Kong, November 28th, 2024, Chainwire Moongate has officially launched its native token, $MGT, marking a significant milestone in the company’s mission to reshape brand-consumer engagement and redefine the value of user attention. Moongate is the first attention asset protocol for real-world activations. Launched in 2022, Moongate Protocol is actively utilized by over 3,800 brands and creators, including Binance, OKX, Token2049, EthDenver, Animoca, Wonderfruit, ComplexCon, and Sony. The protocol has empowered thousands of brands to launch smart token campaigns, driving engagement from more than 1.7 million end users. As the digital landscape continues to evolve, the $MGT token introduces a structured, incentive-based model for brands and consumers alike. Designed to support real-world brand activations, loyalty programs, and consumer engagement, $MGT allows users to earn rewards through participation in token-based campaigns while brands can leverage the protocol to interact more meaningfully with their audiences. $5.2M in Funding and Upcoming Exchange Listings for $MGT To achieve this vision and further fuel growth, Moongate successfully secured over $5.2 million in total funding. This includes investments from CMCC Global, Cogitent Ventures, and Token Bay Capital, as well as public sale proceeds from multiple Tier-1 launchpads. The fundraise reflects strong market interest in Moongate Protocol and $MGT, highlighting growing recognition of Moongate’s role in the attention economy. Following the launch of the $MGT token, it is now trading on Bitget , KuCoin , Gate.io, MEXC , and PancakeSwap . Bridging Digital and Real-World Engagement Moongate’s platform empowers brands to create and distribute smart tokens, offering a streamlined solution for businesses to connect directly with users both online and offline. Through initiatives such as NFT memberships, event tickets, and token-gated benefits, Moongate facilitates real-world utilities for brands. $MGT is at the core of this ecosystem, serving as the primary medium for rewards, user incentives, and engagement tracking. “We believe that $MGT will fundamentally shift how users and brands perceive and value engagement,” said Moongate’s CEO, Jonathan Mui. “With $MGT, users gain real benefits for their interactions, while brands can access insights and audiences that reflect genuine interest and commitment.” Key Features of the $MGT Token The launch of $MGT brings multiple features to users and brands: User Staking and Rewards: Users can stake $MGT to earn incentives, receive an allocation to exclusive launches, and participate in governance, shaping the protocol’s future development. Campaign Creation for Brands: Brands can use $MGT to create premium smart token campaigns with expanded functionalities, including an in-depth CRM, analytics, and improved discoverability. Currency for Attention: Brands can utilize $MGT as a reward to capture eligible users’ attention and engagement. This becomes a more efficient customer acquisition channel, enabling a new paradigm where ad-spent goes directly towards the end-user (rather than any intermediaries). For more information about $MGT tokenomics, users can visit Moongate’s Medium . Community Airdrop In line with Moongate’s commitment to rewarding early supporters, the protocol will distribute a portion of the total $MGT supply through a community airdrop. The snapshot was taken on November 15, 2024, and eligible users can now claim their $MGT tokens on claim.moongate.id . What’s Next for Moongate With the launch of $MGT, Moongate is set to expand its platform features while strengthening its partnerships with both Web2 and Web3 brands. Upcoming updates include enhanced staking features, an expanded rewards marketplace, and the release of MoonPad, a launchpad for partner token campaigns. These developments aim to deepen user participation and provide brands with powerful tools to create immersive experiences for their audiences. For more information on $MGT and Moongate’s vision for the future of attention assets, users can visit Moongate’s official website . About Moongate Moongate is an attention asset protocol disrupting the $1T+ attention economy. The protocol consists of two key layers—a utility layer for brands to issue smart token campaigns for real-world engagement, and a data layer where such on-chain engagement data are monetized at scale by key stakeholders. Moongate aims to disintermediate centralized platforms to maximize brand-consumer value. It also introduces an innovative “engage-to-earn” mechanism that promotes active consumer participation for brand rewards and a share of $MGT emission.

Contrary to some hyper-bullish forecasts, van Eck provided a more conservative price target for Bitcoin for this bull run. Van Eck stated, “Our thesis is effectively that Bitcoin will keep to the halving cycle, so we’re looking at sort of $150,000 to $180,000 this cycle as a price target.” He dismissed the notion that Bitcoin could reach $400,000 in the current cycle, suggesting that such a milestone might be achieved in the next cycle. “In the next cycle, it reaches my target of half the value of gold, so $400,000 plus depending on the price of gold,” he added. Discussing the US fiscal deficit, van Eck identified it as “the elephant in the room” and a significant concern for the markets. “We are spending money that’s just completely unsustainable, and for any other country, they’d be headed towards bankruptcy,” he remarked. Related Reading: Will Bitcoin See Another ‘Thanksgiving Day Massacre’? Experts Weigh In He outlined two prevailing schools of thought in Washington regarding fiscal policy. The first is the lobbyist perspective, which asserts that it’s impossible to cut spending significantly, resulting in minimal slowing of growth in the budget deficit. The second is the “extreme disruptors” approach, advocating for a $500 billion cut in government spending. Van Eck credited this figure to Vivek Ramaswamy, co-head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), stating, “They can effectuate that because there are 1,200 programs that are no longer authorized but still spending money, which means that they can terminate them with an executive order.” He described this target as “healthy” and “realistic,” although acknowledging it would not close the entire deficit, which was $1.8 trillion last year. Addressing the market’s reaction to the election of President Trump, van Eck found it peculiar that despite a clear electoral outcome, there remains uncertainty about fiscal policy. “We had a sweep by one political party, yet we don’t really know what their fiscal policy is gonna be,” he observed. He noted that the initial market reaction was negative for gold because of the possibility of government restructuring. “The initial reaction was negative gold because the idea was, wow, maybe they will be able to restructure government. Never bet against Elon, right?” he said. Related Reading: Bitcoin Adoption Grows As Rumble Unveils $20 Million BTC Treasury Strategy Van Eck also commented on geopolitical tensions, particularly the situation in Ukraine and the approval of long-range missiles striking deep into Russian territory. While acknowledging that such events can impact markets, he cautioned, “The problem is geopolitical stuff is completely uninvestable. We never know what next headline is coming, and we don’t know if it’s going to be bullish or bearish.” He advised that professional investors often choose to “do absolutely nothing” in response to geopolitical uncertainties. Catalysts For Bitcoin Price On the subject of institutional interest in Bitcoin and regulatory shifts, van Eck emphasized that the regulatory environment plays a crucial role. “It really depends on the regulatory environment,” he said. He pointed out that while regions like Asia have seen regulators giving the green light, the US has been relatively quiet. However, he noted a recent uptick in interest: “Now, with the new regime, suddenly the phone is ringing.” Van Eck revealed his personal investment stance, stating, “That’s why I have a huge personal investment in Bitcoin and gold.” He expressed optimism about Bitcoin’s maturation process, likening it to a child growing up: “I would say it’s sort of like a teenager, and what gets it to mature is new investor sets coming in.” He noted that while individual investors have embraced Bitcoin ETFs, the wealth management industry has yet to fully engage. Addressing the correlation between Bitcoin and traditional markets, particularly the NASDAQ, van Eck admitted concern: “The thing that worried me the most Bitcoin’s correlation to the NASDAQ was high.” He explained that this high correlation made Bitcoin less attractive to professional investors who were already overexposed to mega-cap tech stocks. However, he remains hopeful that Bitcoin’s correlation will diminish: “Rooting for and expecting that its correlation will go back to zero, which it has been for the long term.” At press time, BTC traded at $95,350.

Japanese Company Metaplanet Plans to Raise $62 Million to Increase Bitcoin Assets The funds will be used to further accelerate Bitcoin accumulation and solidify its position as one of the largest institutional holders of the cryptocurrency. The company explained that its fundraising strategy involves the issuance of variable strike price stock subscription rights, a financial instrument that provides flexibility in subscription pricing. This mechanism is expected to attract the attention of investors looking to benefit from Bitcoin’s upward momentum. Metaplanet announced that its total Bitcoin holdings have reached 1,142,287 BTC, worth approximately $108 million at current market prices. This move is in line with a broader trend among companies using Bitcoin as a long-term store of value amid economic uncertainty. This strategy mirrors that of MicroStrategy, the largest publicly traded Bitcoin holder in the world, which is known for using debt and equity financing to amass large reserves of the cryptocurrency. Metaplanet's decision to increase its Bitcoin reserves underscores the growing interest in digital assets among Japanese firms. The company aims to capitalize on Bitcoin's potential as a hedge against inflation and its growing adoption in both retail and institutional markets. This development is expected to impact Bitcoin's perception among Japanese investors, potentially increasing institutional interest in the asset. With Bitcoin’s recent price appreciation and expectations of wider adoption in 2025, companies like Metaplanet are positioning themselves for significant future gains. *This is not investment advice.

36952709,https://invezz.com/?p=2317558,1732792965,Pro sees Uniswap price hitting $70 as traders flock to iDEGEN,"Uniswap price staged a strong recovery and jumped above a key resistance level as demand for DeFi tokens jumped. It soared and retested the key point at $14, its highest level since March. It has jumped by over 168% from its lowest level in August. Meanwhile, iDEGEN , a new crypto in its presale, is gaining traction among investors. Crypto analyst sees Uniswap price hitting $70 One crypto analyst has expressed a highly bullish Uniswap price prediction. In a post, Alex Clay, who describes himself as a trader and investor, predicted that the coin would initially jump to $28.4 in the near term followed by $45 in the mid-term. His main target is about $70, which would imply a 450% surge from the current level. He pointed to the fact that Uniswap price has formed a cup and handle pattern, a popular bullish sign in the market. This pattern is made up of a rounded bottom and a consolidation followed by a strong bullish breakout. Alex Clay @cryptclay · Follow #UNI $UNI 1000 Days Cup & Handle Accumulation😳Currently testing the neckline of the formation, which is also a Key Zone & 0.236 fib👀 Breakout is imminent imo🚀🎯Mid-Term Target: $28.4🎯Mid-Term Target: $45🎯Main Target Area: $56.3 – $70.5 (sell the main % of your bag… 5:36 PM · Nov 27, 2024 84 Reply Copy link Read 12 replies As shown below, UNI price started to form this patter in June and completed the first part of the cup this week. As such, in the near term, the most viable target to watch is $17, its highest level this month, which is about 33% above the current level. A break above that level will signal to more gains, possibly to $20. The main catalyst for Uniswap is that its network is seeing substantial volume as the crypto rally continues. Its DeFi total value locked (TVL) has jumped to over $6.22 billion, making it the 6th biggest player in the DeFi industry. Also, the volume handled in the network jumped by 65% in the last seven days to $29 billion, meaning that it is seeing strong traction as the crypto rally continues. iDEGEN token sale accelerates Crypto analysts believe that iDEGEN, an upcoming AI cryptocurrency in its presale, could become the next big thing. The hope is that it can mirror the performance of Uniswap and other mainstream cryptocurrencies and do well in the long term. Data on its website shows that iDEGEN has raised over $326,000 in just two days, meaning that it is gaining popularity. iDEGEN is a crypto at the intersection of blockchain, artificial intelligence, and social media, X in particular. According to its documents, the coin differs from other networks in that it does not come pre-loaded with any rules and knowledge. Instead, it comes like a baby that knows nothing and then learns complex details over time. Its white paper notes that the coin will have a maximum supply of 11,111,111,111 IDGN tokens that will mostly be distributed to buyers. Analysts believe that it has room to do well for a few reasons. First, it is in an industry that is seeing strong demand as evidenced by the performance of NVIDIA and Palantir. Second, the federal Reserve is cutting rates, which will push most crypto prices higher. Third, the upcoming Trump administration will be friendly to the crypto industry, which will lead to more inflows in the sector.

36950838,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=372594,1732792553,"US Inflation Rises Again, Could Hawkish Fed Pivot Curb Crypto Bull Market?","Economic data released in the United States on Wednesday has raised red flags as Core PCE inflation has increased to 2.8% for October. The Personal Consumption Expenditures report reflects the average amount of money consumers spend monthly and is used by central bank policymakers as their primary inflation gauge. “The Fed’s worst nightmare is officially here,” exclaimed the Kobeissi Letter, which added that this week’s data confirms that all three inflation metrics are back on the rise. Compounding Inflation These reports have been indicating a rising cost of living in the US since July, and now all three inflation gauges are increasing as well, it revealed. “For the first time since February 2022, Core CPI, PCE, and PPI inflation are now rising at the SAME time.” It added that the clear “elephant in the room” is that inflation has leveled off above the Fed’s 2% target. The Fed’s worst nightmare is officially here: Today’s data confirms ALL 3 inflation metrics are back on the rise. For the first time since February 2022, Core CPI, PCE and PPI inflation are now rising at the SAME time. Did the Fed spark a new wave of inflation? (a thread) — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) November 27, 2024 Kobeissi added that the Core CPI has been above 3% for 42 consecutive months, the longest streak since the early 1990s, “which effectively means we have compounding inflation.” President-elect Donald Trump’s proposed tariffs on China, Canada, and Mexico could also increase consumer prices and push inflation back up. This week, Goldman Sachs economists predicted that tariffs would directly impact Personal Consumption Expenditures. “Using our rule of thumb that every 1% increase in the effective tariff rate would raise core PCE by 0.1%, we estimate that the proposed tariff increases would boost core PCE prices by 0.9% if implemented,” they wrote . Impact on Crypto Increasing inflation means the Federal Reserve could pivot back to a hawkish stance in halting interest rate reductions or even increasing rates again. After starting rate cuts with a 50 basis point cut for the first time in 2008, the Fed is now worried with chair Jerome Powell, who recently said the central banks were “not in a hurry” to cut rates . High interest rates are usually bad news for risk-on assets such as crypto since lower-risk cash-related investments become more attractive. Additionally, higher rates mean lower liquidity and excess money for investing as there is less borrowing. Nevertheless, crypto markets continued to march higher this week, with total capitalization hitting $3.5 trillion again, primarily driven by Ethereum and altcoins. The bullish momentum from a new pro-crypto administration and major institutional acceptance and investment could be enough to overcome a hawkish pivot by the US central bank.

The incident, acknowledged on November 27 during an AMA session hosted on X by Pump Science’s co-founder Benji Leibowitz, has raised concerns about platform security. “We absolutely acknowledge this as a significant failure on our part,” Leibowitz stated, pledging that such a mistake would not occur again. He further assured users that Pump Science will no longer launch tokens through Pump.fun, a decision underscored by the renaming of its compromised profile to “dont_trust” to deter further token purchases. Fraudulent Tokens Flood Market The leaked private key allowed the attacker, described as a “known threat,” to mint fraud tokens , including Urolithin B to E ($URO) and Cocaine ($COKE). Pump Science swiftly warned users against trusting any new tokens issued under its compromised profile. To address the fallout, the platform has partnered with blockchain security firm Blockaid to flag suspicious mints originating from the exposed wallet. Additionally, Pump Science has begun a comprehensive audit of its platform and plans to implement enhanced security measures, including a bug bounty for penetration testing. While partially attributing the leak to Solana-based software firm BuilderZ, which mistakenly included private keys for a developer wallet in its GitHub codebase, Pump Science dismissed BuilderZ as the likely attacker. Instead, the team suspects the culprit is linked to a prior hacking incident involving James Pacheco, co-founder of Solana-based platform Elmnts. Commitment to Future Security Pump Science remains committed to bolstering security before launching new tokens, aiming to complete audits and enhancements by the holiday season. The platform specializes in trading tokens linked to longevity medicine, with only two legitimate tokens—Rifampicin (RIF) and Urolithin A (URO)—currently active. Data from CoinGecko reveals that RIF and URO hold market caps of $85.6 million and $37.2 million, respectively. Rifampicin is an antibiotic used to treat tuberculosis, while Urolithin A is a dietary supplement touted for its mitochondrial and anti-inflammatory benefits.

EigenLayer is trading at $3.7945, with an intraday pullback of 1.43%. However, the last night's surge resulted in a 14.07% bullish engulfing candle with a 24-hour high set at $4.1419. Will this recovery in EigenLayer lead to a new price surge beyond $5? Let’s take a quick look at its price action to find out more.EigenLayer Price AnalysisIn the 4-hour chart, the EigenLayer price trend shows a breakout rally gaining momentum. The bull run began with a sudden reversal from the $2.14 level, followed by a 5.18% surge that created a bullish engulfing candle on Nov. 21. EigenLayer Price Chart The trend momentum has continued to surge, challenging the long-standing resistance trendline in the 4-hour chart. With multiple rejections, the trendline had previously trapped bullish attempts at growth. However, a massive surge of 5.61% on Sunday, Nov. 24, marked the breakout of the falling channel pattern. Over the last week, the recovery rally in EigenLayer has seen 6 out of 7 bullish candles.In the 4-hour chart, a higher price rejection formed an evening star pattern, and the price is now consolidating slightly above the $3.60 support level. The sudden increase in overhead supply comes from a long-standing supply zone extending from $4.07 to $4.14.Eigenlayer Chances of a Bull RunFor the bullish trend to continue, the breakout rally must sustain a closing above $4.15 on the 4-hour chart. The increased bullish momentum has resulted in a golden crossover, with the 100 and 200 EMAs approaching a bullish crossover.Furthermore, the 4-hour RSI has entered the overbought zone, indicating a minor pullback or consolidation before buyers regain control. However, both the momentum indicator and the moving averages remain optimistic about the future price trend of EigenLayer.According to Fibonacci levels, the breakout rally could target the next price levels at $4.96 and $6.23. With the broader market recovery, these targets will likely be reached in December.

A former executive at Binance is suing the crypto exchange in the United Kingdom, claiming she was wrongfully dismissed after reporting a colleague’s alleged attempt to solicit a bribe from a customer, Bloomberg has learned . Amrita Srivastava, a senior Binance employee based in London, testified at an employment tribunal that she was fired after raising concerns about the bribery incident. Srivastava said the colleague took the money “under the guise of providing consultative services” to track the customer’s integration into Binance, while pretending not to be affiliated with the company. The colleague has since left Binance, the report reads. Srivastava, who worked remotely on Binance’s Link platform connecting brokers and customers to the exchange, is suing European arm, Binance Europe Ltd. She told her managers about the bribery in April 2023, but was dismissed a month later, per Bloomberg. You might also like: FTX sues Binance and CZ for nearly $1.8b over alleged SBF transfer In response, Binance’s lawyer said the exchange was already aware of the incident and that Srivastava’s dismissal was due to poor performance, not whistleblowing. A spokesperson for the exchange told Bloomberg in a statement that the decision to end her employment for poor performance “pre-dated concerns she raised about an issue that was already known and under investigation by our internal audit team.” While working at the Link unit, Srivastava said there was pressure to deliver deals as Binance was trying to fill a revenue gap after realizing that about a quarter of Link’s service revenue had come from a customer with ties to Iran. Binance’s lawyer said in court filings that the company’s executives were aware of the bribery and had escalated the matter.

As prices near these thresholds, anything tied to the asset gets an extra spark of energy.  The Nasdaq-listed ProShares UltraShort Bitcoin ETF (SBIT) is a case in point, posting record trading volume of over 8 million shares on Nov. 13 as bitcoin topped $90,000 for the first time and strengthening the case for a rally into six figures by year-end, data tracked by TradingView show.  Since then, BTC has held between $90,000 and $100,000, and the ETF's daily trading volume has averaged just over 5 million shares. That's significantly greater than the sub-2 million readings over the preceding months.  The ETF seeks to deliver twice the inverse daily price performance of bitcoin, so  that if BTC falls by 1%, the ETF rises by 2%, offering a leveraged bearish bet on the cryptocurrency.  The spike in volume could be associated with the capitulation of investors who bought the ETF early this year anticipating a slide in BTC. Or it could be bulls protecting their long positions in spot/futures markets from possible BTC price pullbacks as the key $100,000 level approaches.  The latter seems to be the case, because inflows into the ETF have picked up. The fund registered a net inflow of $17.7 million on Friday, the most since its debut in April, according to data source ETF.com.  Bitcoin bulls, however, can still stay optimistic as the 11 spot bitcoin ETFs have accumulated over $2.5 billion in net inflows since Nov. 13, according to data tracked by Farside Investors.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/11/28/ultra-short-bitcoin-etf-offering-2x-inverse-returns-sees-record-volume-as-btc-holds-above-90-k,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c4d005d47f8da03d1dc15c214e99f8c6ea493183-1280x960.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The latest Ethereum upside momentum was partly driven by increased capital flowing into the asset’s exchange-traded fund (ETF), alongside a surge in open interest and futures premium. Now, the Ethereum rally is facing its first major test as the ETH/BTC pair approaches a critical resistance zone dubbed the ‘trouble area’ around 0.04615 BTC, which could act as a strong ceiling, potentially leading to a price rejection, according to an outlook shared by prominent pseudonymous crypto trading expert CrediBULL in an X post on November 28. Ethereum price analysis chart. Source: TradingView/CrediBULL Ethereum will likely form a lower high if this rejection is confirmed, which could drive ETH into its weekly demand zone. The expert noted that the price movement is closely tied to Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) performance, suggesting that a broader market pullback could amplify Ethereum’s downward move, pushing it toward the key $2,700–$2,800 buy zone.

In an X post on November 28, Martinez set ETH’s short-term target at $6,000, with the $10,000 projection as a long-term price forecast. His projection is based on Ethereum’s technical structure, which shows the asset continues to trade within a strong ascending channel. Ethereum price analysis chart. Source: TradingView/Ali_charts The outlook aligns with the $8,000 set by another trading expert, Alan Santana, who set a similar target. Ethereum’s rally was backed by $40.6 million in net inflows into its ETF on November 26, marking three consecutive days of positive activity around the asset. This inflow contrasts with Bitcoin ETFs, which have faltered recently, a shift attributed to possible changes in investor sentiment amid anticipation of the start of the altcoin season. Further supporting the bullish narrative around the cryptocurrency, Ethereum open interest (OI) hit a record 6.55 million ETH, valued at $23.34 billion, on November 27, as more investors showed confidence in the asset.

The weekly chart highlights the magnitude of ETH’s recent breakout, with the asset gaining over 15% during the timeframe. Ethereum seven-day price chart.

This target remains possible, considering ETH is trading above the 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages, confirming a strong upward trend. However, Ethereum is in overbought territory with a 14-day relative strength index (RSI) of 70, signaling a possible price consolidation or pullback could be on the cards. Investors should remain cautious of a potential dip below $3,000.

36950357,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=105051,1732791612,IREN Stock Surges 30% on AI Interest and Bitcoin Dividend Prospects,"IREN Stock Climbs 30% as AI Expansion and Bitcoin Dividend Ignite Investor Interest The stock of Bitcoin mining company IREN soared nearly 30% on November 27, 2024, following major announcements that have sparked optimism among investors. According to CoinDesk , IREN revealed interest from a trillion-dollar artificial intelligence (AI) firm to utilize its Texas site for computing infrastructure. Additionally, company executives hinted at plans for a potential Bitcoin dividend in 2025, a move that could further enhance shareholder value. These developments come at a time when Bitcoin’s price is rallying, creating new opportunities for IREN to diversify its revenue streams and strengthen its market position. AI and Bitcoin: A Strategic Shift for IREN IREN’s diversification into AI hosting marks a significant pivot for the company. The interest from a leading AI firm in using IREN’s Texas site highlights the growing demand for high-performance computing infrastructure, particularly in the AI sector. AI Hosting Potential: With AI workloads requiring immense computational power, IREN’s mining facilities are well-positioned to serve as a hub for AI firms seeking scalable and cost-effective solutions. Post-Halving Challenges: Bitcoin’s halving earlier in the year reduced mining rewards, squeezing profits for miners like IREN. By branching into AI hosting, the company can offset these challenges with a lucrative alternative revenue stream. Bitcoin Dividend Hints: A Game-Changer for Investors In an additional boost to investor confidence, IREN executives hinted at the possibility of issuing a Bitcoin dividend in 2025. This announcement aligns with the company’s strategy of leveraging its low mining costs to maximize profitability. Competitive Mining Costs: IREN’s mining costs stand at $29,000 per BTC, significantly lower than the current market price of $96,000. This wide margin provides ample room for the company to generate surplus Bitcoin for dividends. Shareholder Appeal: A Bitcoin dividend would be a unique offering in the market, appealing to both crypto enthusiasts and traditional investors seeking exposure to Bitcoin without direct ownership. IREN’s Position Amid Bitcoin’s Price Rally Bitcoin’s current price rally has created a favorable backdrop for IREN’s announcements. As the leading cryptocurrency trades at $96,000, mining firms like IREN are enjoying robust profit margins, attracting attention from both investors and strategic partners. Market Confidence: The surging price of Bitcoin underscores strong demand and sentiment, further enhancing the appeal of IREN’s stock. Strategic Timing: By announcing AI diversification and Bitcoin dividend plans during this rally, IREN demonstrates its ability to capitalize on market conditions and investor interest. Investor Reaction and Market Impact The 30% surge in IREN’s stock price reflects investor enthusiasm for the company’s strategic initiatives. Key drivers of this reaction include: AI Hosting Potential: The trillion-dollar AI firm’s interest signals validation of IREN’s infrastructure capabilities and opens the door to long-term partnerships. Bitcoin Dividend Hype: Hints of a Bitcoin dividend add a layer of excitement, particularly as dividends in cryptocurrency remain a rarity in traditional markets. Market Diversification: IREN’s move into AI hosting showcases its adaptability and forward-thinking approach to navigating a challenging post-halving environment. What’s Next for IREN? IREN’s announcements point to a promising future, but their execution will determine long-term success. Key focus areas include: Securing AI Partnerships: Formalizing agreements with AI firms will be critical for IREN to realize its diversification goals. Maintaining Mining Efficiency: Continued cost efficiency in Bitcoin mining will ensure the company remains competitive in a volatile market. Dividend Viability: Successfully issuing a Bitcoin dividend in 2025 would require sustained profitability and strategic management of its Bitcoin reserves. Broader Implications for the Industry IREN’s diversification strategy could set a precedent for other Bitcoin mining firms facing similar post-halving challenges. The combination of AI hosting and potential Bitcoin dividends highlights the importance of innovation and adaptability in the evolving cryptocurrency landscape. Conclusion: A Bold Step Forward for IREN IREN’s stock surge underscores the market’s approval of its strategic pivot toward AI hosting and the prospect of a Bitcoin dividend. These initiatives, coupled with Bitcoin’s ongoing price rally, position the company for sustained growth and investor appeal. As IREN navigates this transformative period, its ability to execute these plans will be closely watched, not just by its shareholders but by the broader cryptocurrency and technology industries.

36950356,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=105054,1732791556,Analyst Links Bitcoin Price Surge to Tether’s Activity,"Tether Accused of Fueling Bitcoin’s Price Surge: Analyst’s Bold Claims The meteoric rise in Bitcoin’s price has reignited debates about market manipulation, with a recent assertion from analyst Jacob King adding fuel to the fire. Posting on X (formerly Twitter), the Whalewire analyst suggested that Tether (USDT) is the driving force behind Bitcoin’s recent surge, accusing the stablecoin issuer of questionable practices. King did not mince words, describing Tether as “a shady, unregulated Chinese entity” that has “printed several billion out of thin air” and funneled the funds into “a network of corrupt exchanges.” His stark warning: Tether’s collapse could become “the greatest financial disaster in history.” The Allegations Against Tether: What’s Being Claimed? King’s assertions highlight long-standing skepticism about Tether’s operations and its influence on the cryptocurrency market. Unregulated Printing of USDT: King alleges that Tether has issued billions of USDT without backing, artificially inflating Bitcoin’s price. Market Manipulation: These funds, according to King, are channeled into exchanges to create demand for Bitcoin, pushing prices higher and misleading investors. Ponzi Scheme Accusation: King labeled Tether’s operations as “the largest Ponzi scheme in history,” arguing that its eventual collapse could have catastrophic consequences for global financial markets. Such allegations are not new, but their resurgence amid Bitcoin’s price rally has sparked fresh scrutiny of Tether’s role in the crypto ecosystem. Bitcoin’s Recent Price Surge: Genuine Demand or Artificial Pump? Bitcoin’s price has been on a steady ascent, recently crossing $96,000, driven by increased adoption and investor confidence. However, King’s claims raise questions about whether this growth is underpinned by organic demand or artificially inflated through Tether’s activities. On-Chain Analysis: Critics argue that large inflows of USDT into exchanges often coincide with Bitcoin price spikes, suggesting a correlation that may not be coincidental. Market Sentiment: While many investors celebrate Bitcoin’s rally, others worry that such rapid growth could be unsustainable if driven by manipulated demand. What Is Tether’s Role in the Crypto Market? Tether (USDT) is the largest stablecoin in the cryptocurrency market, with a market capitalization exceeding $80 billion. Designed to maintain a 1:1 peg to the U.S. dollar, Tether provides liquidity and stability, enabling traders to quickly move in and out of volatile assets like Bitcoin. Liquidity Provider: Tether’s widespread adoption on exchanges has made it a cornerstone of crypto trading. Controversy Over Reserves: Despite its prominence, Tether has faced repeated accusations about the adequacy and transparency of its reserves. Tether has maintained that every USDT is fully backed by cash or cash equivalents, though audits and regulatory investigations have painted a more complex picture. Reactions to King’s Claims The boldness of King’s statements has elicited strong reactions from both skeptics and supporters of Tether: Support from Critics: Longtime critics of Tether point to King’s claims as further evidence of the stablecoin’s outsized influence and potential risks. Defenders of Tether: Supporters argue that Tether’s role as a liquidity provider is essential for market efficiency and that accusations lack concrete evidence. Community Divisions: The cryptocurrency community remains deeply divided, with some calling for greater regulation and oversight while others advocate for self-regulation. What Happens If Tether Collapses? King’s dire warning about a potential Tether collapse has reignited fears about the systemic risks associated with stablecoins. Market Liquidity Crisis: Tether’s collapse could lead to a liquidity crunch, severely impacting Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Regulatory Fallout: Such an event would likely accelerate global regulatory efforts, potentially stifling innovation in the crypto space. Wider Financial Impact: Given the growing intersection of crypto with traditional finance, the fallout could ripple beyond the crypto market, affecting banks, investors, and payment systems. Calls for Greater Oversight King’s claims come at a time when regulators worldwide are intensifying scrutiny of stablecoins and their impact on financial stability. U.S. Efforts: American regulators, including the SEC and CFTC, have been investigating Tether’s practices and its reserve backing. Global Concerns: The IMF and other international bodies have raised alarms about stablecoins, calling for coordinated regulation. Enhanced transparency and independent audits of stablecoins like Tether could address these concerns, but achieving consensus on global regulatory standards remains a challenge. Conclusion: A Storm Brewing in the Crypto World? Jacob King’s assertion that Tether is behind Bitcoin’s price surge has reignited long-standing debates about the stablecoin’s influence and integrity. Whether or not these claims are validated, they serve as a reminder of the complexities and risks inherent in the cryptocurrency market. As Bitcoin continues its rally, investors and regulators alike will be watching Tether’s next moves closely, knowing that the stablecoin’s stability—or lack thereof—could have far-reaching implications.

36950247,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=105044,1732791446,Elon Musk Declares: IRS to Be Audited by D.O.G.E.,"Elon Musk Proposes Bold Move: IRS to Be Audited by D.O.G.E. Elon Musk, the ever-provocative tech billionaire and visionary, has stirred the pot yet again. According to a post by Watcher Guru on X (formerly Twitter), Musk declared that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the U.S. tax authority, will undergo an audit conducted by a new entity: the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.). This unexpected announcement has generated significant buzz across social media platforms and the broader financial and political landscape, highlighting Musk’s ongoing interest in reforming institutions he perceives as inefficient or overly bureaucratic. What Is D.O.G.E.? A Playful Acronym with Serious Intent Musk’s use of the term “D.O.G.E.”—an acronym seemingly inspired by the popular Dogecoin cryptocurrency—has captured widespread attention. Known for his playful yet purposeful naming conventions, Musk may be suggesting a blend of humor and ambition in the proposal. While some interpret this move as a critique of the IRS, others see it as a legitimate push for enhanced government accountability and transparency. Musk’s history with Dogecoin and his fondness for disruptive, tech-driven solutions lend credibility to the idea that D.O.G.E. could represent a serious effort to streamline government processes. Elon Musk and His History of Bold Statements Musk is no stranger to making headlines with his unconventional ideas and public statements. From suggesting radical changes in energy policies to launching ambitious ventures like Tesla, SpaceX, and Neuralink, Musk has consistently demonstrated his willingness to challenge the status quo. This latest announcement about the IRS falls in line with Musk’s reputation for advocating efficiency and innovation. It remains unclear, however, how D.O.G.E. would operate or whether this concept has any tangible backing at present. IRS in the Spotlight: Why an Audit? The IRS has long been a focal point for discussions about government inefficiency and bureaucratic red tape. Critics argue that the tax agency’s processes are outdated, prone to error, and insufficiently transparent. By calling for an audit, Musk is likely tapping into a shared sentiment among taxpayers who seek greater accountability from the agency responsible for collecting federal revenue. The proposal raises questions about how such an audit would be conducted, what metrics would define “efficiency,” and whether the IRS is open to external scrutiny. Public Reaction: A Mix of Humor and Serious Debate Social media platforms erupted with reactions ranging from amused skepticism to serious debate about government efficiency. Some users praised Musk for bringing attention to an issue many consider overdue for reform, while others questioned the feasibility of the D.O.G.E. initiative. The Dogecoin community, in particular, embraced the announcement with enthusiasm. Memes and hashtags like #AuditByDOGE began trending, reflecting the cryptocurrency’s culture of humor and community-driven initiatives. Could D.O.G.E. Be the Catalyst for Change? Musk’s idea may seem unconventional, but it aligns with broader calls for innovation in government operations. By leveraging modern technology and data-driven approaches, D.O.G.E.—if realized—could serve as a model for reimagining how public institutions operate. Whether or not the proposal materializes, it underscores the need for dialogue about improving transparency and efficiency within agencies like the IRS. Potential Challenges and Next Steps While the concept of D.O.G.E. is intriguing, implementing such an initiative would face significant hurdles: Legal Barriers: Federal agencies like the IRS are governed by strict regulations. Introducing an external auditing body would require substantial legal groundwork. Public and Political Buy-In: Achieving bipartisan support for such reforms would be crucial, particularly in a politically polarized environment. Technological Infrastructure: For D.O.G.E. to succeed, it would need access to cutting-edge tools and robust data analytics capabilities to evaluate the IRS effectively. Conclusion: Musk’s Vision Sparks Dialogue Elon Musk’s announcement about auditing the IRS through the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) may be a blend of humor and innovation, but it has undeniably struck a chord. Whether viewed as a critique of government inefficiency or a serious proposal for reform, the idea has reignited discussions about transparency, accountability, and the role of technology in improving public services.

Noting that Ethereum has consistently experienced two rounds of price increases, namely two bull phases, in previous bull rallies, the analyst claimed that the second bull market for ETH has begun in the current bull market cycle. The analyst finally noted that the second bull market cycle in Ethereum always significantly exceeds the local highs during the first bull market cycle. “Ethereum's secondary bull run has begun: In past crypto market bull markets, Ethereum has experienced two major bull runs. Ethereum's second bull cycle always significantly exceeded the price established in the first bull cycle.” Looking at short-term ETH predictions, Lin Chen from Deribit noted that options traders predict a 29.1% probability that Ethereum will close the year above $4,000.

36956869,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=102771,1732790591,"Here Are Projected Timelines for Dogecoin to Hit $3.03, $9.35, and $18.03","Market watchers from top entities like Changelly project timelines for Dogecoin’s (DOGE) potential surge to $3.03, $9.35, and $18.03. Dogecoin (DOGE) remains one of the top-performing coins in the ongoing bull run. Recall that the price of DOGE soared to $0.4359 on November 12 before falling below $0.35 a few days later. This shocking move sparked a major debate over whether DOGE’s bull run has come to an end. However, the token showcased that its bull run is far from over, as its price rallied to $0.4775 over the weekend. The spectacular surge reignited investors’ confidence in Dogecoin, with top analysts setting different targets for the asset. Changelly Predicts Timeline for DOGE Surge to $3.03, $9.35, and $18.03 Specifically, analysts from Changelly set three targets for Dogecoin, such as $3.03, $9.35, and $18.03, along with projected timelines for when DOGE might attain these milestones. Dogecoin to $3.03 The $3.03 prediction is the smallest target out of the set. Despite this, hitting this target would mark Dogecoin's new all-time high (ATH). For context, Dogecoin set its previous ATH of $0.73 on May 8, 2021. With DOGE currently trading at $0.4710, reaching the $3.03 target would require a substantial increase of 543.3%. At a price of $3.03, Dogecoin’s market cap would stand at $445.13 billion. According to Changelly analysts, Dogecoin would trade at $3.03 by January 2033, nearly nine years from now. Notably, this target would mark Dogecoin’s maximum price for January 2023. Earlier this year, famous chartist Ali Martinez forecasted that Dogecoin would trade around the $3 territory this year. He projected that DOGE would trade at $3.5 in April if history repeats itself. However, this prediction did not materialize as DOGE continues to trade below the $1 territory. Nonetheless, pseudonymous market observer Crypto Yapper predicted that Dogecoin would rise to $3 by May 2025, six months from now. Dogecoin to $9.35 Hitting the $9.35 target requires a more substantial rally compared to the $3.03 forecast. Specifically, Dogecoin must witness an increase of 1,885% from the current price to reach the $9.35 target. At this price, Dogecoin’s market cap will soar to $1.37 trillion, surpassing Ethereum’s current valuation of $414.73 billion. Analysts from Changelly project a timeline of January 2040 for Dogecoin to reach $9.35, indicating that it would represent DOGE’s minimum price by then. Unlike the $3.03 prediction, the $9.35 target has not gained momentum within the Dogecoin community. Consequently, few market observers have projected timelines for when DOGE might clinch the target. However, data from top prediction platform Telegaon show that Dogecoin would trade at a maximum price of $9.34 by 2035, less than five years from Changelly’s estimated timeline. Dogecoin to $18.03 The $18.03 forecast is an ambitious target that requires Dogecoin to rally by 3,728% from the current price of $0.47. At $18.03, Dogecoin’s valuation would stand at $2.64 trillion, surpassing Bitcoin’s market cap of $1.96 trillion. According to Changelly analysts, the $18.03 prediction would become a reality for Dogecoin by February 2040, one month after the meme-based token hits a target of $9.35. Can DOGE Soar to $3.03, $9.35, or $18.03? Given Dogecoin’s hefty supply of 146.91 billion tokens, there is no guarantee that DOGE will attain any of the targets. However, Dogecoin has experienced a substantial rise in the past, soaring 18,340% within the first five months of 2021. Moreover, factors such as the ongoing bull market, the Elon Musk effect, massive retail interest, and payment utility can pave the way for DOGE’s substantial price surge in the future. It is worth noting that this article is for informational purposes and should not be taken as financial advice.",POSITIVE,DOGE,BTC | BUSINESS | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/28/here-are-projected-timelines-for-dogecoin-to-hit-3-03-9-35-and-18-03/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=here-are-projected-timelines-for-dogecoin-to-hit-3-03-9-35-and-18-03,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

36949625,https://coinpaprika.com/news/7-pro-tips-to-streamline-your-crypto-operations-during-bull-cycles,1732790192,7 Pro Tips to Streamline Your Crypto Operations During Bull Cycles,"The crypto market is on fire as Bitcoin ( BTC ) and other assets keep popping up green, glowing candlesticks almost daily. This trend continues to spark renewed interest among traders and investors as they look to take advantage of the market's growth. Capitalizing on the bull cycle requires strategic planning and efficient tools. This is because it is easy to get carried away by the hype and make costly mistakes such as buying the top. To prevent this from happening, here are seven tips to help every crypto enthusiast stay on top of the market and make the most of this bull cycle. 1. Stay Ahead of Emerging Market Trends With bull runs come new market trends—from meme coins to AI tokens to DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure) assets. Keeping abreast with these trends positions crypto users to tap into these opportunities early. For instance, those who hopped into the 2021 meme coin trend early were made multimillionaires. Dogecoin (DOGE) soared by 15,000% between January and May 2021, while Shiba Inu (SHIB) printed a whopping 43,000,000% in the same year. These instances demonstrate how quickly trends dominate the crypto market and how early adopters can be the biggest winners. Tools such as CoinPaprika , NOW Tracker , LunarCrush, and Messari can be used to track trending projects, top-performing tokens, and social sentiments. 2. Have a Strategy Even when it seems like everything turns to gold during a bull run, it is still important to have a clear trading or investment strategy. Doing this eliminates emotional actions especially since the bull run is associated with FOMO and other emotional-driven decisions. Having a clear strategy involves assessing one's level of exposure to a trend, determining one's risk appetite, selecting one's preferred assets to invest in, and determining one's buy strategy (lump sum vs dollar cost averaging). 3. Streamline Operations with Multi-Functional Tools The crypto market is volatile and fast. And it's twice as volatile and fast during a bull market. Thus, to take advantage of the market, it is important to use efficient platforms that save time and reduce friction. For example, a go-to option would be a wallet that provides multiple blockchains and assets , fiat-to-crypto options, and seamless swapping. These features would quicken decision-making and execution. 4. Diversify Portfolio to Manage Risks and Maximize Opportunities As the saying goes, never put all your eggs in one basket. This has never been truer than in a bull market. Aside from capturing profits from different assets, diversifying a portfolio mitigates risks. So even if one is a Bitcoin maxi, it is still necessary to look into other assets such as promising altcoins, stablecoins for hedging, and trend-driven tokens like meme coins or NFTs. Also, it is imperative to note that diversifying a portfolio requires having an efficient wallet that will allow one to manage, monitor, and rebalance their portfolio effectively. 5. Delve into Passive Income Opportunities The crypto market is not all about buying and selling. Through DeFi protocols, it offers other earning opportunities such as various rewards for liquidity provision. Platforms that give access to DeFi protocols allow users to lend, borrow, or participate in yield farming on networks like Ethereum, BSC, and more. 6. Anticipate Market Corrections As mentioned earlier, a bull market is a very volatile one. Thus, the candlesticks wouldn't always glow green. Usually, a bull market goes this way: Bitcoin moves Ethereum follows Altcoins join the party Mid-cap coins follow suit The market corrects Micro-cap coins pump The market trades sideways Meme coins make moves The market goes red Fear and panic heighten The big dump happens The cycle repeats Knowing this cycle is important so one is not caught off guard. So, as mentioned earlier, having a portion of one's portfolio in stable assets is another effective way to guard oneself against sudden pullbacks. 7. Always Be Informed The difference between a profitable crypto user and one who is not is information. Knowledge is that safe-haven asset that protects all other assets. Hence, it is key to stay updated with market insights from reputable sources and engage with other community members in online platforms such as Telegram and Discord. NOW Wallet: The Effective Tool For Efficient Crypto Management For those into the current bull run, NOW Wallet stands as a reliable solution for streamlining their crypto operations. Its services cater to storing, sending/receiving, buying/selling, swapping, and staking digital assets, and even connecting to decentralized applications (dApps). NOW Wallet also offers non-custodial access, multi-currency support, and proactive customer support service to help users navigate this bull run successfully. Here's an overview of its key features. 1. A Multi-Functional Wallet NOW Wallet is that versatile wallet perfect for the bull run. By being non-custodial, users have total control over their assets. To protect their privacy, they do not need to undergo any registration or KYC procedures if making crypto-to-crypto transactions. However, users would need a KYC verification when buying or selling cryptocurrencies for fiat. This is because NOW Wallet's fiat partners mandate identity verification before completing exchanges. Yet, the wallet’s integration with third-party payment processors enables users to exchange over 60 fiat currencies to cryptocurrencies directly within the app. They can buy and sell crypto using the most popular payment methods like Mastercard, Visa, Apple Pay, Google Pay, or bank transfers. Besides these characteristics, other standout features include: Support For Different Chains and Cryptocurrencies: Users can effortlessly manage over 50 coins and 15,000+ tokens, including the OGs like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), stablecoins such as Tether (USDT), privacy coins like Monero (XMR), and meme coins including Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Pepe (PEPE). These assets are spread across different blockchains such as Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, and AVAX C-Chain, among others. Users can also add custom tokens from NOW Wallet’s supported EVM-compatible blockchains, as well as from the Tron network. Built-In Swaps: Users can seamlessly exchange their assets without leaving the app. Thanks to its integration with the ChangeNOW instant exchange service, NOW Wallet provides the cross-chain swap feature, allowing for fast, low-barrier, and transparent crypto exchanges between different blockchain networks. So for users looking to cash in on a profit or those wanting to diversify their portfolio during the bull run, this extensive swap functionality provides a veritable portal to do that. Cross-Platform Compatibility: NOW Wallet is compatible with mobile (iOS/Android) and desktop (macOS, Windows, Linux) devices. This makes it easy for users to access the wallet at any time and at any place, even if they are on the go. Support for NFTs: NOW Wallet provides an intuitive dashboard for managing NFT collections. Users can store, send, and receive their digital collectibles alongside cryptocurrencies. Pro benefits: To enjoy a more personalized wallet experience, users can sign up for the ChangeNOW Pro version through NOW Wallet. Whether opting for the free or paid plans, users unlock various benefits, including cashback rewards on each transaction, a set number of AML checks, the ability to earn interest through unlimited crypto loans, and private webpages for receiving crypto funds. Generally, NOW Wallet simplifies complex processes, making it easier to act swiftly during market opportunities. 2. A Tool Integrated with DApps DeFi protocols become even more popular during bull markets. These protocols offer lucrative opportunities such as yield farming and lending. To give users access to these protocols, NOW Wallet has a WalletConnect integration that allows users to scan a QR code to gain quick access to any dApps on Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, and other networks. Furthermore, users can benefit from the wallet's earning features by staking Proof-of-Stake (PoS) tokens such as Tron (TRX), Binance Coin (BNB), NOW Token (NOW), Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and more. This creates an additional income stream for those seeking to effortlessly multiply their gains during the bull market. Summary The ongoing bull run is an exciting opportunity for crypto investors and traders. However, they must be careful to ensure that they don't get carried away by the excitement. To do this, they must streamline their operations by staying ahead of trends, diversifying their portfolio, and using efficient crypto tools—of which NOW Wallet is one. With its robust features, NOW Wallet helps users maximize their gains during this bull cycle. It supports a diverse range of cryptocurrencies, thus widening the opportunity for crypto enthusiasts to capitalize on the current uptrend. However, while NOW Wallet offers compelling solutions and opportunities in a bull market, the main focus for users should be to align their trading or investment strategies with market movements whilst ensuring they are prepared for the volatile dynamics of the market.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH | SHIB,BTC | ETH | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/7-pro-tips-to-streamline-your-crypto-operations-during-bull-cycles,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/36949625.jpeg

36956868,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=103103,1732789965,Market Expert Says XRP to $2 is Not Even a Question,"Amid the recent XRP price action, some experts believe it is likely to breach the previous 2021 high to claim a seven-year top. Notably, XRP has been on a remarkable surge, recently reclaiming $1 for the first time in three years. After peaking at $1.63 on Nov. 23, the asset has faced a slight pullback and is consolidating around $1.46. With an impressive 188% rise in November alone, analysts are now more bullish on XRP, predicting the $2 milestone is within reach and expecting long-term gains beyond $8. XRP Eyes $2 Once $1.6 ClearsCrypto analyst and entrepreneur Armando Pantoja is championing this narrative. In his latest analysis , the angel investor suggests that XRP’s bullish setup is far from temporary. He shared a 30-day chart which highlights a major upward trend, starting in early November. This trend’s foundation features a surge in whale accumulation and positive market sentiment. XRP 30D Chart | Armando Pantoja Despite this run, Pantoja suggested that XRP’s MACD appears to be cooling, and its Relative Strength Index (RSI) is not yet in an overbought position, indicating a sustained rally rather than an overheated market. Citing these market conditions, he believes once XRP clears $1.60 , resistance to $2 will be minimal, likely triggering FOMO among traders. Meanwhile, beyond this level, he remains confident that XRP’s long-term target lies between $8 and $20.XRP Could Face Its Next Roadblocks at $1.63, $1.88 and $1.96Interestingly, another analysis from market commentator Dark Defender complements Pantoja’s outlook. However, Dark Defender focuses on shorter-term timeframes to discuss XRP’s next price direction from this level over the next few days. https://twitter.com/DefendDark/status/1861873151052747045Using a 4-hour XRP chart, he confirmed the importance of the Fibonacci level at $1.44, which XRP has successfully breached by closing two consecutive candles above it. This move indicates a potential move toward the $1.63 resistance zone, which could set the groundworks for XRP to climb to $1.88. His chart shows that XRP is leveraging massive support within the Ichimoku cloud.Dark Defender predicts that sustained movement above $1.44 will act as a launchpad for further gains. If XRP claims the $1.88 target, it would face minimal resistance on its journey toward $1.96. Interestingly, veteran trader Peter Brandt expects a massive run once $1.96 gives way.XRP’s Symmetrical TriangleMeanwhile, analyst Mikkybull also recently shared a 4-hour XRP chart showing consolidation within a symmetrical triangle. He pointed out that a similar triangle formed earlier in November, following XRP’s breach of the $1 level . This consolidation lasted for five days before XRP rallied to $1.63. https://twitter.com/MikybullCrypto/status/1861684780275822691Mikkybull sees parallels in the current price action, with the latest triangle forming after the drop from the $1.63 high. He expects another breakout that could push XRP toward the $2 price range .Notably, all these analysts unanimously agree that maintaining support levels like $1.44 will help in sustaining the rally. Further, breaking through resistance at $1.63 could act as a catalyst for the next leg up to $2 and beyond.",POSITIVE,XRP,BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | XRP | ZRX,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/28/market-expert-says-xrp-to-2-is-not-even-a-question/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=market-expert-says-xrp-to-2-is-not-even-a-question,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

On Nov. 7, Bitwise unveiled plans to rebrand its European XRP ETP, previously known as the ETC Group Physical XRP, as the Bitwise Physical XRP ETP. While the ticker symbol, GXRP, remains unchanged, the rebranding signals Bitwise’s broader strategy to unify its product offerings under its own branding as it accelerates its European expansion. This development follows Bitwise’s acquisition of the ETC Group in August 2024, a deal that marked its formal entry into the European crypto investment space. The ETC Group, with $1 billion in managed assets, offers a suite of physically backed crypto ETPs, including flagship products such as the Bitcoin ETP (BTCE), Ethereum with staking (ET32), Solana (ESOL), MSCI Digital Assets Select 20 (DA20), and the newly rebranded Bitwise Physical XRP ETP (GXRP). Physically backed ETPs like GXRP track the performance of their underlying assets by holding those assets directly. This structure provides investors with a more transparent and secure way to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies compared to synthetic or derivative-based products. The Bitwise Physical XRP ETP is designed to meet the growing appetite for institutional-grade crypto products among European investors. By offering a physically backed solution, GXRP provides a streamlined, regulated avenue for investors to gain exposure to XRP and its blockchain ecosystem. Hunter Horsley, co-founder and CEO of Bitwise, emphasized XRP's standing as one of the most trusted blockchain networks in the cryptocurrency space. “We’re thrilled to be providing access for investors through an institutional quality product with the Bitwise Physical XRP ETP (GXRP),” said Horsley in a press release. As part of its European strategy, Bitwise also plans to rebrand its entire portfolio of European ETPs, signaling a unified push to establish itself as a premier provider of institutional-grade crypto investment products across the continent. The firm’s growth trajectory in 2024 has been significant, with its total client assets surpassing $10 billion. The company has expressed intentions to launch additional ETPs to cater to the rising demand. Bitwise has been actively expanding its product lineup in 2024 as well. On Nov. 12, the company launched its first Aptos staking ETP, further diversifying its offerings. Shortly after, on Nov. 26, it filed an S-1 registration to introduce an ETF tied to Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH). Ripple’s investment in GXRP is part of the company’s strategic vision to capitalize on the growing demand for crypto-backed ETPs, particularly in the European market. Although financial details of the investment were not disclosed, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse highlighted the burgeoning global interest in regulated cryptocurrency investment products. “With the US regulatory environment for crypto finally becoming more clear, this trend is poised to accelerate, further driving demand for crypto ETPs, such as the Bitwise Physical XRP ETP,” Garlinghouse said. The Ripple Effect on Institutional Crypto Products Ripple’s investment in GXRP is likely to bolster its standing as a key player in institutional crypto products. With XRP and the XRP Ledger already recognized as pivotal blockchain technologies, this partnership is expected to deepen their adoption among European investors. The investment aligns with Ripple's broader strategy of fostering innovation in blockchain finance while advocating for regulatory clarity in the global crypto landscape. The rebranding of the Bitwise Physical XRP ETP and Ripple’s investment signify a transformative phase for the European crypto market. Bitwise’s strategic moves, supported by Ripple’s financial backing, position GXRP as a compelling choice for investors seeking secure and regulated exposure to XRP. As the global demand for crypto-backed investment products continues to grow, this partnership is evidence of the increasing convergence of blockchain innovation and traditional finance. Ripple’s involvement could further accelerate the adoption of crypto ETPs in Europe, setting a precedent for similar collaborations between blockchain firms and traditional investment product providers. With regulatory clarity improving in key markets, the stage is set for exponential growth in the crypto ETP space. The Mystery of Arthur Britto: A Silent Architect of Ripple and the XRP Ledger In the world of blockchain and cryptocurrency, names like David Schwartz and Jed McCaleb resonate strongly, credited as visionaries behind the creation of Ripple , XRP, and the XRP Ledger. Yet, a third name, Arthur Britto, remains shrouded in mystery. Known as one of the trio of architects responsible for these groundbreaking innovations, Britto’s enigmatic nature and steadfast avoidance of the limelight have made him a figure of intrigue within the crypto community. Britto’s name resurfaced recently in a social media exchange involving Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz. Responding to a long-unanswered question that lingered for over three years, Schwartz directly addressed speculation that he might be Britto himself. Arthur Britto, alongside Schwartz and McCaleb, was instrumental in shaping Ripple and its flagship digital asset, XRP. The XRP Ledger, a decentralized platform designed for fast and cost-effective cross-border payments, was a product of their collective vision. Together, they sought to address inefficiencies in traditional financial systems, pioneering innovations that continue to influence the blockchain industry. While Schwartz and McCaleb have maintained active roles within the cryptocurrency community — the former as Ripple’s CTO and the latter as the founder of Stellar (XLM) — Britto’s absence from the public sphere has lent an air of mystique to his contributions. Despite his low profile, Britto remains a revered figure in Ripple’s origin story, embodying a commitment to innovation over individual recognition. Schwartz’s recent remarks also shed light on the challenges Ripple faced during its formative years, particularly the fallout from Jed McCaleb’s departure. McCaleb, who later founded Stellar to compete directly with Ripple, left a significant mark on the company’s trajectory. According to Schwartz, McCaleb’s exit stemmed from tensions over corporate governance and diverging priorities. These disagreements reflected broader challenges in the cryptocurrency sector, where personal ambitions and financial incentives often conflict with collaborative innovation. Ripple’s ability to navigate these obstacles and emerge as a leader in blockchain-based payment solutions demonstrates the resilience of its foundational team, including Britto. While McCaleb’s departure drew public attention, Britto remained quietly steadfast, avoiding controversy and continuing his work behind the scenes. The Importance of Arthur Britto’s Contributions Despite his preference for privacy, Britto’s influence on Ripple and the XRP Ledger is undeniable. David Schwartz acknowledged that Britto’s ideas and contributions were central to the creation of the XRP Ledger’s unique features, such as its consensus protocol and its emphasis on scalability and efficiency. Schwartz’s lighthearted acknowledgment of Britto’s willingness to let others take credit for his ideas suggests a recurring theme in Britto’s role: dedication to the technology over personal acclaim. His quiet yet impactful presence has helped shape Ripple into a company that has consistently pushed the boundaries of blockchain technology. Arthur Britto’s story is an example of the diversity of personalities driving the cryptocurrency revolution. While many industry leaders thrive on visibility and influence, Britto’s commitment to remaining in the background highlights a different approach: letting the technology speak for itself. In an industry often defined by controversy and competition, Britto’s low profile stands in stark contrast to his significant contributions. As Ripple continues to expand its global footprint and drive adoption of blockchain-based solutions, Britto’s foundational work remains a cornerstone of its success.",POSITIVE,XRP,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | WALLET | XRP,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6287/ripple-backs-rebranded-bitwise-xrp-etp-for-european-investors,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

36956866,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=103160,1732789510,"Shiba Inu Team Compares Current SHIB Rally to 2020, Says Super Cycle Yet to Come","Shiba Inu marketing specialist, Lucie, suggests that the current market conditions are similar to those witnessed in 2020, which marked the early stage of the 2021 bull cycle. The prices of various crypto assets have skyrocketed tremendously in recent times. The rally, which began after the U.S. election, saw various assets like Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL) hit new all-time highs (ATH). For instance, while Bitcoin registered an ATH of $99,655 on November 22, Solana surged to a peak price of $263 the following day. Shiba Inu Price Action However, altcoins like Shiba Inu have yet to register a new ATH in the ongoing bull run, triggering concerns that SHIB had been left out in the rally. For context, Shiba Inu only surged to $0.00003031 on November 12 from a monthly low of $0.00001626. Despite the rally, SHIB was still down 64.82% from its ATH of $0.00008616, registered on October 28, 2021. Following the recent correction across the broader market, some investors claimed the bull run has ended, with SHIB losing out. Lucie React However, Lucie suggested that the market trend is similar to what investors observed in 2020 before the explosive rally that followed suit in 2021. Recall that Shiba Inu launched in August 2020 with ten zeros after its decimal. On November 28, 2020, Shiba Inu plunged to its all-time low (ATL) of $0.000000000056, with many investors losing hope in the asset. After falling to its ATL, the canine-themed token did not record any significant price movement in 2020. However, things changed for Shiba Inu in 2021, with top exchanges listing it on their platforms amid surging demand. Moreover, Shiba Inu saw its biggest burn in May 2021 when Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin transferred over 410 trillion SHIB to the official dead wallet. These activities attracted investors' attention to SHIB, ultimately taking the token to an ATH of $0.00008616 in October 2021. According to Lucie, the current market trend is similar to 2020, preceding the hefty bull run in 2021. She characterized 2025 as the ‘year of the super cycle,’ which could potentially result in a larger bull run, similar to the 2021 record. Furthermore, she encouraged investors to remain patient and ensure they invest in assets that could achieve extraordinary growth. Experts Anticipate New ATH Above $0.0001 for SHIB At press time, Shiba Inu is currently hovering around the $0.000025 level. The asset is trading at $0.00002541, up 2.64% over the past 24 hours. Despite trading below its ATH, several experts believe a new peak looms for Shiba Inu. Specifically, some investors project that Shiba Inu will surge above $0.0001 in the ongoing 2024/2025 bull cycle. In May, Bitcoin investor Dona set a target of $0.000114 for SHIB, while top expert Javon Marks forecasts an imminent climb to $0.0001553. It remains unclear whether Shiba Inu will hit any of these targets before the end of the 2024/2025 bull market.",NEUTRAL,BTC | SHIB,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/28/shiba-inu-team-compares-current-shib-rally-to-2020-says-super-cycle-yet-to-come/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=shiba-inu-team-compares-current-shib-rally-to-2020-says-super-cycle-yet-to-come,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

According to a Global Ledger report shared with crypto.news, over $552 million in stolen cryptocurrency was laundered via cryptocurrency mixing service Tornado Cash between Jan.1 and Nov. 27. Tornado Cash received a total of 457,768 ETH, valued at around $1.64 billion at current prices, during this period. The majority of these funds came from high-risk sources, and over 56% of the total amount was linked to crypto hacks that occurred in 2023 and 2024. This is a noticeable jump from 2023, when Tornado Cash handled 314,740 ETH in withdrawals. The WazirX hack in July was the largest contributor this year, with the attacker funneling 61,698 ETH, worth around $217.2 million, through the mixing service. Funds from the Heco Bridge hack came second, with 52,281 ETH ($189.1 million) laundered. The hack originally transpired in 2023, but the attacker laundered the funds in March this year.

Meanwhile, 12,930 ETH ($46.8 million) came from the Orbit Chain exploit . Lastly, the Penpie exploit added 11,261 ETH, worth $40.8 million, to the mixer’s illicit transactions. Tornado Cash was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury in 2022 for its role in facilitating money laundering. The regulator alleged that since 2019, the service processed over $7 billion in illicit funds, including $455 million linked to North Korea’s Lazarus Group. Recently, a U.S. Court ruled that the Treasury overstepped its authority by sanctioning some of Tornado Cash’s immutable smart contracts. The Global Ledger report warned that this ruling creates a “dangerous precedent” that could hinder global efforts to combat financial crime in the crypto space, stating that “bad actors may launder even larger amounts of cryptocurrency” as regulators face challenges enforcing compliance. The decision could also shake investor confidence and prompt regulators to impose stricter rules, “which could mean legitimate businesses face heightened scrutiny and tighter reporting requirements,” the report added.

Ken Sim, the mayor of Vancouver, Canada’s third largest city, has announced plans to add Bitcoin to the city’s balance sheet in order to diversify the city’s investment portfolio and become a Bitcoin-friendly city. Mayor Sim submitted a motion titled “Preserving the purchasing power of the city through diversification of financial resources: Becoming a Bitcoin-friendly city” to add Bitcoin as a reserve asset for the city. This motion will be presented to the city council on December 11.

If you’re looking for opportunities in the current market, there’s plenty to explore—whether it’s new advancements or surprising rebounds. With the crypto scene buzzing, some coins have been making waves, grabbing the attention of investors and analysts alike. Recently, Hedera’s resurgence has sparked curiosity, while Aave’s consistent performance has cemented its place as a serious contender. But Qubetics ($TICS) is stealing the spotlight among these exciting developments. As its presale heats up, the buzz around this blockchain project is undeniable. This article will explore why Qubetics is being hailed as the best altcoin to buy now, alongside insights into Hedera and Aave. Qubetics: Revolutionising Crypto with Accessibility and Utility The Qubetics Wallet is about to set a new standard in the cryptocurrency world. This game-changing feature is built with accessibility and convenience at its core , launching across iOS, Android, and desktop platforms. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or a newcomer, managing your $TICS tokens and other digital assets has never been easier. But here’s the real kicker: Qubetics isn’t just about simplifying crypto. It’s about empowering users with tools that align with their financial goals. The wallet’s intuitive design ensures seamless management, no matter your preferred device. This kind of innovation is why many analysts are calling Qubetics the best altcoin to buy now for anyone looking to get ahead in the digital asset space. Debit Card Integration and Mobile Payment Compatibility Imagine linking your crypto wallet directly to your debit card or using Apple Pay at your favourite coffee shop. Qubetics makes this a reality. Planning on collaborating with major networks like Visa and Mastercard, the Qubetics Wallet ensures compatibility with Apple Pay and Google Pay. This integration bridges the gap between traditional and digital finance, letting users tap into their $TICS tokens for everyday purchases. It’s a step toward making cryptocurrency as easy to use as cash. The ability to manage, spend, and invest—all from one platform—is why Qubetics stands out as the best altcoin to buy now for practical and forward-thinking investors. Hedera: A Surprising Comeback Hedera ($HBAR) has defied expectations with a stunning 130% surge over the past month, trading at $0.12 as of press time. What’s driving the excitement? A few key developments. Rumours are swirling that Hedera board member Brian Brooks might replace Gary Gensler as SEC Chair—a shift that could be bullish for the project. Add in Canary Capital’s application for the first Hedera ETF, and the momentum is undeniable. Despite its $4.7 billion market cap, many believe Hedera still has room to grow. Aave: Breaking Resistance and Gaining Ground Aave ($AAVE) continues to impress, breaking above the $161.21 resistance and holding strong at $176.27. This breakout is more than a technical achievement—it’s a testament to Aave’s growing market presence. In 2024 alone, Aave has tripled its loan volume to $10 billion and increased its Total Value Locked (TVL) by 26.7% to $15.96 billion. With annualised revenue soaring by 1,628% to $113.84 million, it’s clear Aave is thriving. The next resistance point sits at $183.75, and if the momentum holds, $200 isn’t far off. Despite these impressive stats, Aave’s market challenges leave room for questions about its future trajectory. Presale Frenzy: Don’t Miss Qubetics Phase 10 Qubetics is in Presale Phase 10, and it’s already turning heads. Here’s the deal: with each new phase, the price of $TICS tokens increases by 10%, and the final phase will see a 20% jump. Right now, one $TICS token costs just $0.025, making this phase incredibly attractive for early investors. Let’s break it down. If you invest $100 at the current price, you’ll snag around 4,000 $TICS tokens. And with the post-presale price set to hit $0.25, you’re looking at a potential 900% ROI. So far, over 231 million $TICS tokens have been sold to more than 4,500 holders, raising $3.4 million. If you’ve been searching for the best altcoin to buy now , this is your sign. The numbers don’t lie, and the clock is ticking. As each week passes, the price climbs, so acting fast could make all the difference. Conclusion: The Future Looks Bright for Qubetics, Hedera, and Aave All three coins—Qubetics, Hedera, and Aave—offer unique opportunities in today’s crypto market. Hedera’s resurgence and Aave’s consistent growth are proof that this space is alive with potential. But if you’re looking for the best altcoin to buy now, Qubetics is the clear standout. With its innovative wallet, practical payment integration, and a presale generating massive excitement, Qubetics is more than a cryptocurrency—it’s a movement. Don’t miss your chance to get in early.

The ETP allows retail and institutional investors to gain exposure to the world’s largest memecoin, Dogecoin (DOGE). The launch of the Valour Dogecoin (DOGE) ETP expands Valour’s digital asset products, offering investors exposure to the world’s largest memecoin by market cap without direct DOGE ownership. Traditional Finance Seeks Access to Memecoins The parent company of Valour Inc., DeFi Technologies, announced the introduction of Valour Dogecoin (DOGE) ETP on Sweden’s Spotlight Stock Market. The launch marks the first Dogecoin ETP available in the Nordics, allowing retail and institutional investors to gain exposure to DOGE without directly owning Dogecoin. DeFi Technologies, a crypto-native tech company at the forefront of merging traditional capital markets with DeFi, said its subsidiary Valour, a leading issuer of exchange-traded products (ETPs), now offers investors a simple and secure way to gain exposure to Dogecoin, which currently holds a market cap of $59.53 billion and is the 7th largest digital asset globally. Dogecoin Surges on the Back of US Election The Valour Dogecoin (DOGE) ETP grants investors exposure to Dogecoin’s performance without directly owning the cryptocurrency. Through a management fee of 1.9%, the ETP provides investors a secure avenue to participate in the crypto market. Elaine Buehler, Head of Product at Valour, commented; “Introducing the world's first Dogecoin ETP in the Nordics represents a significant milestone in our mission to democratize access to digital assets. We are excited to provide investors with a regulated product that captures the essence of Dogecoin's dynamic market presence.” Dogecoin (DOGE) surged in popularity and value after Donald Trump’s election victory and the president-elect’s announcement of the Department of Government Efficiency, nicknamed DOGE. According to Trump, DOGE will pave the way for his administration to “dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditure, and restructure Federal Agencies – Essential to the “Save America” Movement.” Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy will co-lead the newly created department. Johanna Belitz, Head of Nordics at Valour, commented on the motivation behind the launch of the ETP. “In light of the recent U.S. presidential election results and the subsequent surge in demand for Dogecoin, the launch of the Valour Dogecoin ETP on the Spotlight Stock Market aligns with our mission to provide investors with timely access to high-demand digital assets. The growing popularity of Dogecoin, bolstered by influential figures like Elon Musk, highlights our commitment to delivering innovative and diversified investment opportunities in.” The Rise of Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin, the OG memecoin, is a peer-to-peer, open-source cryptocurrency introduced in 2013 as a comedic alternative to Bitcoin. Despite its joking beginnings, DOGE transitioned into the most popular and widely utilized digital currency with strong community backing and market presence. DOGE employs the Scrypt algorithm to enable fast and low-cost transactions and boasts several unique features. Dogecoin’s utility stems from its inflationary design with no maximum supply and its support for steady coin issuance, all of which make it ideal for microtransactions and daily use. The memecoin is widely used to tip content creators, donate to charitable causes, participate in crowdfunding initiatives, and make payments to merchants like SpaceX and the Dallas Mavericks. DOGE’s success is driven by its active and loyal community and the support of Elon Musk. The memecoin surged in value following Trump’s victory, gaining over 145% in the past month.

These immutable contracts, targeted in 2022 for their alleged role in laundering over $7 billion worth of crypto, were deemed beyond the scope of OFAC’s statutory power. The decision, which emerged from a case backed by Coinbase and six plaintiffs, doesn’t completely absolve Tornado Cash but opens the door for a potential policy shift starting in 2025. Legal experts believe the case will return to lower courts for additional motions and judgments, a process likely to stretch over several months. Bill Hughes, senior counsel at ConsenSys, stated that OFAC retains major power to sanction entities connected to Tornado Cash. However, the ruling could redefine how sanctions on immutable smart contracts are approached under a new administration. Trump’s Administration Could Shape Policy The incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump may be pivotal in determining Tornado Cash’s fate. According to Hughes, the Trump Treasury might align with the court’s analysis, potentially softening the sanctions regime. “Under a Trump administration, it’s more likely that this opinion will be adopted as Treasury policy,” Hughes noted, while cautioning that changes may not be immediate. Trump’s national security stance on crypto remains uncertain, but his Treasury pick, Scott Bessent, a prominent financial adviser, may steer policy in a new direction. While Tornado Cash’s sanctions status under President Biden involved 44 smart contract addresses listed as Specially Designated Nationals, Trump’s administration could reshape how the U.S. handles crypto-related sanctions. Tornado Cash Legal Battles Meanwhile, the broader Tornado Cash saga continues to unfold in courtrooms globally. Crypto advocacy group Coin Center has its own lawsuit against the Treasury , arguing that smart contracts lack the characteristics of “property” and should not be subject to sanctions. Separately, Tornado Cash co-founders face prosecution . Roman Storm, charged by the U.S. Justice Department, is set to stand trial in April 2025. His co-founder Roman Semenov remains on the FBI’s most-wanted list. Calls from the crypto community for clemency may increase should Storm face conviction.

According to a Nov. TK announcement, sAxess aims to improve access control, security and credential recovery processes. The partnership leverages IDEMIA’s connections and expertise in connectivity and payment solutions to bring Serenity’s blockchain services to its 1,900 financial and fintech clients. The partner companies hope that the card in question will meet the demands for secure and scalable data management solutions by industries and individuals who manage digital assets and systems involving digital assets. SAxess will be launched globally before the end of December. The card leverages fingerprint authentication and other biometrics to ensure that it only authenticates authorized individuals. This is different from traditional authentication smart cards that only check if the individual has access to the card — which made them particularly suitable for multi-factor authentication. The sAxess card also leverages IDEMIA’s B.CHAIN hardware wallet allowing users to control their digital assets without engaging a third-party custodian. It also implements Serenity’s patent-pending data recovery technology, which allows data access under predefined conditions. The data recovery solution uses a non-fungible token (NFT) as digital credentials, allowing users to set specific conditions such as inheritance for authorized data access. Serenity CEO Venket Naga said: “We are looking to a new era in data security, with increasingly complex and frequent digital threats targeting individuals and organizations of all sizes. [...] By merging cutting-edge biometric capabilities with our blockchain solutions, we are ensuring that individuals and businesses can access and manage their sensitive data with unprecedented security and ease.” This is far from Serenity’s first product, with its previous offerings also heavily focusing on security and privacy.

Days before the US elections, XRP’s price was in a sideways movement, ranging from $0.55 to $0.54. #XRP – Sell Signal 🦄: When this guy starts talking about #XRP and the importance of owning it, and trading it and storing it. This is my sell signal until then ride the waves. pic.twitter.com/rmazMF5cc5 — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) November 25, 2024 Then, starting on election day, its price started to increase, from $0.5031, and it broke the $1 mark last November 16th. And last November 23rd, XRP hits its three-year high at $1.6335, reflecting a 220% increase in three weeks. Starting November 24th, XRP’s price began to dip again, showing signs of correction. Ripple’s token has been in the red for four consecutive trading days, the first time in almost two months. Despite the asset’s “minor price correction,” XRP has consolidated above the $1 level and currently trades at $1.4. Sell According To Cramer’s Insights? Ripple’s XRP has been one of the best-performing tokens in the market recently. It has increased by 26% in the past week, compared to Bitcoin’s increase of just 0.45% in the same period. With XRP showing a strong consolidation in the $1 level, EGRAG playfully mentioned that SRP will start to lose its market momentum once Cramer shares his thoughts and opinions. According to EGRAG, XRP’s biggest sell signal occurs when host Cramer starts talking about XRP and recommends this token to new investors. The crypto commentator further shared that Cramer’s attention on XRP triggers his exit from the market, but in the meantime, he’s riding the bullish wave.

Crypto Firm CEO Predicts Explosive Growth Cramer’s History Of Comments On BTC And Crypto Cramer consistently provides insights on Bitcoin and crypto through his Mad Money show. However, the host gained prominence for his insights and recommendations that promised the opposite. For example, during the first few days of January 2024, Cramer suddenly called Bitcoin a technological marvel after years of dismissing the asset. Before making his insights public, BTC traded at $45k, but it soon dipped to $41k after the public consumed the news. Crypto holders and analysts have described this scenario as the “Cramer Inverse.” This crypto investing principle is easy to follow—just do the opposite of what Cramer recommends. Now, according to EGRAG, the same scenario can happen to Ripple’s XRP. If Cramer decides to promote XRP, it’s EGRAG’s sign to sell, and XRP’s price will fall.

However, the cryptocurrency faces considerable downward pressure after failing to climb above $100,000. Investors are bracing for a potential drop below $90,000. With significant options expiring on December 27, traders are hedging risks amid profit-taking. BTC had plummeted below $91,000 before recovering, with the price up almost 3% over the past 24 hours. The correction wiped out $200 billion from the crypto market, with several investors liquidated. Markets made a strong recovery, with the market cap surging almost 4% to $3.32 trillion. Ethereum (ETH) is up nearly 7% as it moved past $3,500, with buyers eying the $3,600 price level. Solana (SOL) also registered substantial gains to climb above $240, attempting to reclaim $250. Other gainers include Dogecoin (DOGE) , Cardano (ADA) , Stellar (XLM) , Toncoin (TON), Polkadot (DOT), and Chainlink (LINK) . Bitcoin Faces Downward Pressure Bitcoin (BTC) slipped to a low of $90,700 after failing to break the $100,000 ceiling and creating significant downward pressure as investors brace for profit-taking and the expiry of contracts. BTC has risen significantly this year, with a 30% increase recorded since the beginning of November following Donald Trump’s victory in the US elections. Trump threw his weight behind digital assets during his campaign, promising to make the US the crypto capital of the world. However, with $11.8 billion worth of options set to expire, investors expect considerable volatility on that day. Market watchers have also blamed profit-taking for the Bitcoin selloff. Anthony Pompliano, the founder and CEO of Professional Capital Management, stated in a letter to clients that long-term BTC holders have distributed over $60 billion worth of BTC in the past 30 days. Bitwise Proposes Diverse Crypto ETF Bitwise has submitted an application to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch an ETF based on its index fund of ten cryptocurrencies. If approved, the ETF will be the most diverse and comprehensive crypto ETF in the US. The proposed ETF will include Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP) , Avalanche (AVAX), Cardano (ADA), Chainlink (LINK), Bitcoin Cash (BCH) , Uniswap (UNI), and Polkadot (DOT). Bitwise has maintained its index fund since 2018, aligning its values with the listed cryptocurrencies. The SEC has acknowledged the receipt of the application, as market watchers await the regulator’s decision. However, the deadline for a decision on the application is yet to be determined. Can The Crypto Market Rebound On Black Friday? The crypto markets faced a significant decline as overbought conditions triggered a drop. As a result, the market capitalization fell to its lowest point in over a week. The crash came as Bitcoin and other assets faced significant selling pressure amid major geopolitical developments with President Joe Biden announcing that Lebanon and Israel have agreed to a US-mediated proposal to end the conflict. Data from CryptoQuant showed that the Profit and Loss ratio for Bitcoin reached levels comparable to March 2024, when BTC traded around $73,500. However, a thaw in the Middle East tensions could lead to a drop in demand for safe-haven assets. Additionally, an analysis revealed long-term holders moved $60 billion worth of BTC in the last 30 days. This marks the heaviest profit-taking this market cycle, increasing selling pressure as retail investors absorb supply during bullish phases. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) rebounded from $92,000 to go above $95,000. However, the cryptocurrency is back in the red during the current session as sellers look to drive it below $95,000. Market watchers are anticipating a significant correction as bullish sentiment loses steam. BTC failed to break above $100,000, allowing sellers to exert control and lower the price. As a result, BTC fell below $91,000 before recovering to its current levels. A substantial correction could see BTC slip below $90,000 and fall as low as $80,000-$85,000 before recovering. Despite recent wobbles, analysts expect BTC to break above $100,000 by the end of the year. BTC spent last week in bullish territory, notching a substantial increase on Thursday to go above $95,000 and settle at $97,784. It surged to a new all-time high on Friday, reaching $99,655 before declining and settling at $98,355. BTC fell back on Saturday after failing to go above $100,000, dropping over 1% and settling at $97,113. Sellers drove BTC to an intraday low of $94,838 on Sunday as selling pressure registered a considerable increase. However, BTC recovered from this level to register a rise of 0.80% and settle at $97,891. Source: TradingView However, selling pressure increased substantially on Monday as BTC fell over 5% to go below $95,000 and settle at $92,845. Bearish sentiment persisted on Tuesday as BTC dropped to an intraday low of $90,708. Buyers attempted a recovery as BTC rose to $95,000 before losing momentum and settling at $91,913, registering a drop of 1%. Buyers returned to the market on Wednesday as BTC made a strong recovery, rising by 4.32% to go back above $95,000 and settle at $95,883. The current session sees BTC marginally down as buyers and sellers struggle to exert control. If sellers retain control, BTC could drop to $92,000 or as low as $90,000. On the other hand, buyers will look to retake control and test the $100,000 level. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) surged past $3,500 on Wednesday after a substantial rally. However, it finds itself back in the red during the ongoing session as sellers look to drive it below $3,500. ETH started the previous week on a positive note before dropping back. By Wednesday, it hit a low of $3,031. However, it made a strong recovery on Thursday, rising 9.42% and settling at $3,360. Despite a strong showing on Thursday, ETH fell back into the red on Friday after encountering significant volatility, dropping 0.96% to $3,328. The weekend began with a strong recovery as ETH surged to an intraday high of $3,502 before declining and settling at $3,396. The price fell back in the red on Sunday, dropping to a low of $3,288 before recovering and settling at $3,362, registering a decline of 1.01%. Source: TradingView ETH recovered on Monday as it surged to an intraday high of $3,547. However, buyers lost momentum after reaching this level and fell back to $3,415, ultimately registering an increase of 1.60%. Bearish sentiment returned on Tuesday as ETH dropped by 2.64%, falling to a low of $3,225 before settling at $3,325. Despite considerable selling pressure, ETH rallied on Wednesday, surging almost 10% to move past the resistance at $3,500 and settle at $3,657. However, the price is back in the red during the current session, down by 1.59% and trading at $3,599. Sellers will look to drag ETH below $3,500. If sellers continue to exert control, we could see ETH drop as low as $3,000. On the other hand, if buyers regain control they will look to drive ETH towards $4000. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL)'s attempts at recovery have been thwarted during the ongoing session, with the altcoin finding itself back in the red. SOL has been facing significant volatility since last week, dropping to a low of $230 on Wednesday. However, it made a strong recovery on Thursday, rising almost 9%, going above $250 and settling at $256. Volatility returned on Friday as buyers attempted a move past $260, and sellers looked to drive the price below $250. SOL ultimately registered only a marginal increase. Buyers tried to go above $260 on Saturday as SOL reached an intraday high of $264. However, buyers lost momentum above $260, and SOL fell back, dropping 0.78% to $254. Source: TradingView Bearish sentiment intensified on Sunday as SOL fell to a low of $241. However, it recovered from this level to climb above $250 and settle at $252, registering a drop of 0.83%. The current week began with a substantial increase in selling pressure as SOL plummeted over 7%, slipping below $250 and settling at $232. Selling pressure persisted on Tuesday as SOL experienced considerable volatility. SOL eventually dropped by 1.49% and settled at $230, where the 20-day SMA acted as a dynamic resistance level. SOL recovered from this level on Wednesday, rising almost 5%, going above $240 and settling at $242. However, it finds itself in the red during the current session, with the price down by 1.21% and trading at $239. Tron (TRX) Price Analysis Tron (TRX) registered a dramatic increase towards the end of the previous week after dropping to a low of $0.193 last Wednesday. TRX recovered on Thursday to register a rise of 1.80% and settle at $0.198. The price went above $0.20 on Friday after an increase of 3% pushed it to $0.204. Saturday saw TRX continue its upward trajectory as it surged to an intraday high of $0.225. However, buyers lost momentum at this level, and the price fell back, ultimately settling at $0.213. Despite significant bullish sentiment, TRX fell back into the red on Sunday as sellers attempted to drive it below $0.20. TRX fell to an intraday low of $0.20 but recovered to settle at $0.208. Source: TradingView Selling pressure intensified on Monday as TRX plummeted almost 6%, slipping below $0.20 and settling at $0.196.

However, it recovered from this level to settle at $0.195, ultimately registering a decline of 0.71%. Buyer activity resumed on Wednesday as TRX rose almost 3% to $0.20. However, TRX finds itself in the red during the current session, with the price marginally down as buyers and sellers struggle to establish control. Toncoin (TON) Price Analysis Toncoin (TON) registered a dramatic increase over the weekend, surging an incredible 15.74% to go past $6 and reach an intraday high of $6.60 before declining and settling at $6.30.

On Sunday, TON fell to an intraday low of $5.78 and rose to an intraday high of $6.59 before registering a drop of 2.52% and settling at $6.15. The current week began with volatility persisting as TON dropped by 0.96% to $6.09, but not before falling to a low of $5.92. Sellers dragged TON to an intraday low of $5.69 on Tuesday as selling pressure registered a substantial increase. However, the price recovered from this level, registering a jump of 0.85% and settling at $6.14. Source: TradingView Bullish sentiment intensified Wednesday as buyers entered the market, pushing TON up by almost 4% to $6.38. The current session sees TON down by 1.24%, with sellers back in control after a failed attempt to go above $6.50. Celestia (TIA) Price Analysis Celestia (TIA) has been on an absolute tear since Thursday when it registered an increase of 9.74% to go above the 20 and 50-day SMAs and settle at $5.42.

Theta Network (THETA) Price Analysis Theta Network (THETA) struggled to stay above $2 as sellers looked to lower the price during the current session.

It finally did so on Saturday after registering an increase of 5.50% to reach an intraday high of $1.98 before settling at $1.88. Sellers attempted to drag THETA below $1.85 on Sunday as it fell to a low of $1.73. However, it recovered from this level to register an increase of almost 4% and settle at $1.95.

As Ethereum breaks a multi-month high of $3,600, the bullish surge increases the chances of reaching $4,000. As one of the previously underperformers, the refreshed momentum has improved the sentiment of the Ethereum market. Given this optimism, one analyst remains firm in his Ethereum price target of $6,000. Will Ethereum reach a new all-time high? Let’s explore.Ethereum Price AnalysisOn the daily chart, Ethereum's price trend shows a breakout from a falling channel, gaining momentum. The breakout rally has completed a rounding-bottom reversal, surpassing the $3,550 mark. Ethereum price Target This crucial resistance acted as the neckline of the rounding-bottom reversal and marked the previous peak in July before the massive drop to $2,100 levels in August. Ethereum is trading at $3,594, with an intraday pullback of 1.71%. This pullback comes after last night's massive jump of 10.05%, which resulted in a bullish engulfing candle above the 78.6% Fibonacci level. Furthermore, it marked the new highest price since June 2024. Hence, the six-month bearish cycle is ending on a bullish note. The 100-day and 200-day EMAs are on the verge of crossing bullishly. This follows a recent golden crossover, reflecting the change in the underlying sentiment. Furthermore, the RSI line escapes a sideways trend near the overbought boundary, revealing room for growth. Hence, the technical indicators maintain a bullish viewpoint on Ethereum. Analyst Targets $6,000 for EthereumCrypto analyst Ali Martinez has remained steadfast in his positive outlook for Ethereum, supporting the possibility of continued upward movement. In his analysis, he highlights a rising channel pattern on the weekly chart and projects a mid-term target of $6,000, with a long-term target of $10,000.According to his analysis, the current rally has reached the midline of the rising channel and will likely target $6,000 if it tests the upper boundary of the channel. Given the current bullish momentum, Ethereum could reach $6,000 if it surpasses the midline. Ethereum Target LevelsNotably, the intraday pullback could be a retest of the 78.6% Fibonacci level breakout and witness a bounce-back. Hence, as the broad market recovers, the Ethereum price trend will likely reach the immediate resistance of $4,091. On the flip side, the crucial support remains at $3,300 and $3,000.",POSITIVE,ETH,ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/28/as-ethereum-breaks-five-month-high-analyst-says-eth-is-headed-for-6000/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=as-ethereum-breaks-five-month-high-analyst-says-eth-is-headed-for-6000,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Users can create, experience, and monetize content and applications. In this virtual world, participants purchase plots of land that they can build upon and monetize. Decentraland uses two tokens: MANA and LAND. MANA is an ERC-20 token used to buy LAND and pay for goods and services in the Decentraland marketplace. LAND is a non-fungible ERC-721 token that represents ownership of virtual real estate. The platform is governed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), giving the community control over the development and policies of the world. Decentraland combines gaming and blockchain, offering users a virtual space that is entirely owned and shaped by them. The Sandbox: A blockchain-based virtual gaming platform Launched by Pixowl, The Sandbox is a blockchain-based virtual world where users can create, build, buy, and sell digital assets in a game. By combining decentralized autonomous organizations and non-fungible tokens, it offers a decentralized platform for gamers. Its main mission is to introduce blockchain technology into mainstream gaming. The “play-to-earn” model lets users be creators and gamers at the same time. The Sandbox uses the SAND utility token, which enables transactions on the platform. This approach could change how players interact with games and own in-game assets. Conclusion In conclusion, while cryptos like MANA and SAND show potential, they may offer less immediate growth in the short term. Meanwhile, CYBRO emerges as a standout opportunity in the current bull run of 2024. As a technologically advanced DeFi platform, CYBRO provides investors with chances to maximize earnings through AI-powered yield aggregation on the Blast blockchain. With staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, and cashback on purchases, CYBRO delivers a superior user experience with seamless deposits and withdrawals. Emphasizing transparency, compliance, and quality, CYBRO distinguishes itself as a promising project with strong interest from crypto whales and influencers. This positions CYBRO as a compelling option for investors seeking significant returns. For more information, visit the official CYBRO website and join the community on X , Telegram , and Discord .

36956862,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=103130,1732786427,Expert Says Ethereum Ascending Price Channel Could Push ETH to $6K-$10K,"With Ethereum surging past $3,600, analyst Ali Martinez targets a mid-term price of $6,000 and a long-term goal of $10,000 as bullish trend builds. As the second-largest crypto by market capitalization, Ethereum has recently broken through several key resistance levels, sparking heightened interest among investors and traders.The crypto surpassed resistance at $3,350 and $3,400, followed by a rally above $3,500. This price movement sent ETH to a multi-month peak of $3,688 before a minor retracement to around $3,605.Ethereum Upward Trajectory within an Ascending ChannelIn todays, Ethereum price news , Technical analysis from Ali Martinez highlights that Ethereum's price action is currently moving within an ascending channel on the weekly chart. ETH is presently trading near the midline of this channel, which is often seen as a critical level for either support or resistance.Martinez has set a mid-term target of $6,000 within this channel, with the potential for ETH to reach $10,000 in the long term. Before Ethereum's recent surge, Martinez had highlighted that the risk-to-reward ratio for entering the Ethereum market was too attractive to ignore. At the time, he projected a target of $6,000 for the cryptocurrency but recommended a stop-loss near $1,880 in case of a bearish outcome. Other Ambitious Outlooks for EthereumOther analysts also see significant potential for Ethereum. Ash Crypto, a prominent analyst, predicts Ethereum could climb to $10,000-$15,000 based on historical trends. According to Ash Crypto, Ethereum’s strongest price action typically occurs between January and April following halving years, making December an ideal time for accumulation. He noted that market patterns show money often flows from Bitcoin to Ethereum, followed by large-cap and smaller altcoins.Another projection from the pseudonymous analyst ""Venture Founder"" highlights the $3,800 level as a key threshold for Ethereum.Once surpassed, Ethereum could reach $5,300, completing a two-year cup-and-handle pattern. The subsequent target for this pattern is $6,500, with the potential for ETH to overshoot to $7,300 by January 2025.Large Holder Activity Boosts Ethereum's Bullish MomentumIn addition to these price predictions, large Ethereum holders are continuing to accumulate, strengthening the bullish sentiment surrounding the cryptocurrency. Data reveals consistent inflows from major players over the past 7, 30, and 90 days, with increases of +14.63%, +44.80%, and +126.85%, respectively.

A total of $127 million will be given out in bitcoin (BTC) or USD to creditors in five classes including retail borrower deposit claims, general earn claims, withhold claims, unsecured loan claims, and general unsecured claims.  Each eligible creditor will receive 60.4% of the value of their claim as of the Petition Date.  After emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy in January this year, the crypto company shut down its mobile and web apps on Feb. 29 and has begun the process of reimbursing creditors. Some creditors also received shares in Ionic Digital, which is a company formed from Celsius’ reorganized mining business.  The upcoming payout follows a much larger one that the company made in August, when Celsius distributed over $2.53 billion to more than 251,000 creditors. The first payout covered about two-thirds of all eligible creditors and about 93% of the eligible value.  Celsius initially filed for bankruptcy relief under Chapter 11 on July 13, 2022 after the business collapsed. Its former CEO, Alex Mashinsky resigned in September 2022. He was later arrested on fraud charges and will go to trial in the U.S. in January 2025.

Internet traffic to major crypto exchanges in Russia surged 8% in early November, spurred by a sharp rise in Bitcoin prices and changes in local regulations, per an analysis done by MegaFon, one of the largest telecommunications companies in Russia. The increase follows a global trend, with web traffic to the top 20 crypto exchanges up 8% to 10% in November compared to October, the company says. According to the analysis, in Russia, users accounted for roughly 27% to 30% of total internet traffic to these platforms. Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) price gained over 45% in November, climbing from $68,000 to $99,000, boosting interest in the crypto market across the globe, including in Russia.

The Chinese platform Gate.io saw a 26% drop in traffic, while Upbit and Kraken lost 6% and 4%, respectively. In addition to the global crypto market’s performance, Russia’s new crypto mining law, which took effect on Nov. 1, may also be contributing to the growing interest, the telecommunication giant says. As crypto.news reported earlier, the law allows crypto mining only for registered individual entrepreneurs and organizations, with non-entrepreneurial miners limited to a 6,000 kWh monthly consumption cap.

The increase coincides with Mythical Games’ announcement of FIFA Rivals, a new mobile game developed in partnership with FIFA. As one of the most influential organizations in global sports, FIFA’s endorsement represents a major milestone for Mythical Games, and the market appears to be responding positively. Kick-Starting MYTH’s Breakout The announcement of FIFA Rivals last week has undoubtedly contributed to the recent surge in MYTH’s price . The game, which is set to launch in mid-2025, promises to bring FIFA’s unparalleled brand and global fan base into the Mythical Games ecosystem. FIFA Rivals will integrate blockchain mechanics to enhance the gaming experience, creating new opportunities for players to engage with FIFA’s iconic teams, players, and tournaments. Given the success of Mythical’s previous flagship game, NFL Rivals , there’s strong speculation that FIFA Rivals could replicate or even exceed that performance. It’s one of the catalysts that’s been driving demand for MYTH , which functions as the core utility token for Mythical’s ecosystem, including its marketplace for trading digital assets. MYTH Makes a Move MYTH, or Mythos, plays a pivotal role within the growing Mythical Games ecosystem. It powers transactions on the Mythical Marketplace, where in-game assets like characters, skins, and collectibles can be traded. As Mythical Games expands its portfolio of games and adds new features, the utility of MYTH will also extend, driving organic demand for the token. The anticipated popularity of FIFA Rivals is expected to increase transaction volumes on the Mythical Marketplace, fueling further adoption of MYTH. Players participating in the game will use the token to acquire and trade exclusive in-game assets, mirroring the success of NFL Rivals, which has contributed significantly to MYTH’s sustained growth in 2024. Sports Finds a Home in Web3 While the announcement of FIFA Rivals is one reason for the increased interest in MYTH, the token’s positive performance is part of a broader trend. Mythical Games has spent years building a robust ecosystem, combining blockchain technology with accessible gaming experiences that appeal to mainstream audiences. Games like NFL Rivals have demonstrated that Mythical Games can attract millions of players, many of whom are not native to web3. By emphasizing fun, intuitive gameplay over complex blockchain mechanics, Mythical has cultivated a loyal user base that is driving the success of both its games and the MYTH token. The announcement of FIFA Rivals is just the beginning of what looks to be a significant period for Mythical Games. With the FIFA brand behind it, the game has the potential to attract millions of players from around the world, many of whom will be interacting with blockchain technology for the first time. While Mythical Games has shown that it can master sports strategy games, it’s got other weapons in its arsenal: mobile game Blankos promises something very different that should appeal to traditional gamers, while Pudgy Party, the forthcoming Pudgy Penguins game, has been designed for a crypto-native audience. As Mythical Games continues to push the boundaries of web3 gaming with projects like FIFA Rivals, MYTH’s role as the cornerstone of this will only grow, making it a token to watch as we move into 2025.

Investors are drawn to these coins not just for their potential gains, but also for the vibrant communities and cultures they foster. Recently, we’ve seen new contenders like Turbo and Dogwifhat trying to carve their niches in this exciting space. While Turbo is testing the waters with some intriguing price movements, Dogwifhat is generating buzz among its supporters, creating a lively competition for the title of the best meme coins to buy today. Amidst this dynamic landscape, BTFD Coin (BTFD) is emerging as a standout option. Currently in its fourth presale stage, BTFD is priced at just $0.000038. In less than 24 hours, it has raised over $150,000 and sold more than 6.5 billion coins. With features like a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game and staking rewards, BTFD Coin is positioned to upend the meme coin scene and offer investors something truly unique. As we dive deeper, we’ll explore how BTFD Coin is leading the charge in the quest for the best meme coins to buy today. In this article, we’ll break down what makes BTFD Coin a top choice, how Turbo is faring in the market, and what challenges Dogwifhat faces as it tries to maintain its momentum. By the end, you’ll understand why BTFD Coin is not just keeping pace but setting the standard for what investors should look for in the meme coin market. BTFD Coin: The Best Meme Coin to Buy Today BTFD Coin is making waves, and it’s easy to see why. With its presale currently priced at $0.000038, the coin has quickly garnered significant interest, raising over $150,000 in just a day. Selling more than 6.5 billion coins highlights the community’s enthusiasm and belief in its potential. When it comes to the best meme coins to buy today, BTFD Coin is a frontrunner, thanks to its innovative features and community-driven approach. One of the standout attributes of BTFD Coin is its Play-to-Earn game. Imagine earning crypto while enjoying a game—this concept not only attracts gamers but also fosters an engaging community that can drive long-term investment. Additionally, the staking rewards offered by BTFD allow holders to earn passive income simply by keeping their tokens. This dual approach not only enhances user engagement but also provides real incentives for investors to stay involved. Let’s consider a hypothetical investment scenario. If you decided to invest $5,000 in BTFD at its current presale price of $0.000038, you would acquire approximately 131.58 million BTFD coins. Once BTFD is officially listed at $0.0006 after the presale, your investment could skyrocket to around $78,948! That’s a potential gain of nearly 1,580%. With such compelling numbers and features, it’s clear why BTFD Coin is not just another meme coin but a legitimate player in the cryptocurrency market. As the presale continues to gain traction, BTFD Coin stands tall as the best meme coin to buy today. Investors seeking excitement and potential returns should keep a close eye on this emerging project, as it promises not only growth but a vibrant community experience. Turbo: A Rising Contender Testing the Waters Turbo has been making headlines lately, showcasing some promising price action that has piqued the interest of many investors. While it may be gaining traction, the question remains: can Turbo sustain its momentum and compete with a powerhouse like BTFD Coin? Turbo’s appeal lies in its branding and aggressive marketing strategies, which have drawn in a substantial following. Investors are excited about the potential for quick gains, and the coin has been marketed as a high-speed investment. However, despite the buzz, Turbo needs more than just hype to establish itself as one of the best meme coins to buy today. Without solid fundamentals or a clear value proposition, it risks becoming just another flash in the pan. What Turbo needs to focus on is building a community that feels invested—not just financially but emotionally. The cryptocurrency market thrives on community engagement. If Turbo fails to deliver ongoing innovations or unique features, it could quickly find itself overshadowed by more established projects like BTFD Coin. While Turbo is currently enjoying a moment in the spotlight, it must evolve beyond short-term gains to secure its place among the best meme coins to buy today. Investors should remain cautious, considering not only the immediate market trends but also the long-term sustainability of Turbo as a viable investment. Dogwifhat: Buzzing but Struggling Dogwifhat burst onto the scene with great fanfare, hoping to capture the hearts (and wallets) of meme coin investors. However, as newer options like BTFD Coin and Turbo gain traction, Dogwifhat is finding it increasingly difficult to maintain its earlier momentum. The question is: can Dogwifhat recapture its buzz, or is it destined to fall behind? Initially, Dogwifhat attracted a loyal following with its quirky branding and community-driven approach. But as time has passed, the lack of substantial updates and innovative offerings has left many investors feeling disillusioned. While community support is essential in the meme coin space, it must be backed by continuous developments that keep the excitement alive. Unfortunately, Dogwifhat has not managed to sustain that excitement, leading to decreased interest. As we move into the future, Dogwifhat’s prospects look uncertain. With BTFD Coin offering a robust ecosystem with a P2E game and staking rewards, and Turbo making strides in the market, Dogwifhat needs to act fast to avoid being left behind. Without a compelling roadmap or tangible updates, it risks losing its place in the pantheon of best meme coins to buy today. For investors considering their options, it would be wise to evaluate Dogwifhat’s potential against the more dynamic offerings of BTFD Coin and Turbo. While Dogwifhat has its fans, the lack of recent developments raises red flags that could deter new investors. Conclusion As the meme coin market continues to evolve, BTFD Coin emerges as the clear leader, showcasing innovative features and community engagement that make it the best meme coin to buy today. Turbo is making strides with its price action, but it needs to solidify its foundation to compete effectively. Meanwhile, Dogwifhat struggles to maintain relevance in a rapidly changing landscape. For anyone looking to make a smart investment in the meme coin space, BTFD Coin is the standout choice. With its engaging Play-to-Earn game and attractive staking rewards, it offers not just potential for growth but also a vibrant community experience. Don’t miss your chance to join the BTFD Coin presale right at the start of its journey—secure your position in the future of meme coins today!

Cybersecurity Expert Turned Scammer Exposed Blockchain investigator ZachXBT accused a former professional Fortnite player from Australia, who is known as ‘Serpent,’ of orchestrating multiple meme coin scams that allegedly stole more than $3.5 million. In a detailed thread that was published on Nov. 27, ZachXBT tied Serpent to a number of Pump.fun meme coin scams that relied on compromised social media accounts to target victims. Serpent was previously expelled from the esports organization “Overtime” in 2020 for alleged cheating. He was also recognized as a blockchain security analyst and the founder of a threat mitigation system called Sentinel. ZachXBT revealed that wallet addresses linked to Serpent’s project “ ERROR ” were directly connected to hacked accounts belonging to high-profile entities, including McDonald’s, Usher, Andy Ayrey, Dean Norris, and Enoshima Aquarium. The investigator also revealed that proceeds from these scams were gambled away in online casinos, and provided evidence of a deposit and withdrawal address linked to the compromised accounts. ZachXBT then shared that Serpent started deleting posts from his new X account after the release of the initial findings on Nov. 26. Serpent attracted a lot of attention in the crypto community in 2022 by sharing cybersecurity tips on avoiding phishing and scam schemes targeting crypto users. He warned about vulnerabilities in Google ads and other fraudulent methods, which gave him credibility as a security expert. However, this latest investigation paints a starkly different picture, and suggests that Serpent exploited his knowledge to his own advantage. Former Binance CEO Criticizes Meme Coin Hype Former Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao recently called on the crypto community to shift focus from meme coins to building meaningful blockchain applications. On Nov. 26, Zhao shared his dissatisfaction with the current state of the meme coin ecosystem, and even described it as “ weird ” compared to its humorous beginnings. Since stepping down as Binance’s CEO in November of 2023, Zhao decided to redirect his efforts toward supporting grassroots Web3 development and education. Meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), which became very popular in 2021 because of hype from people like Elon Musk and the crypto community, have struggled to maintain their appeal. While some of Zhao’s followers backed his call for a focus on building decentralized applications with real utility, others criticized Binance for listing meme coins that lack clear use cases. Binance Futures, which is the exchange’s derivatives platform, still caters to public demand by listing meme coin trading pairs. However, recent additions like Why ( WHY ) and Cheems ( CHEEMS ) saw their prices plummet in just a day of listing. Naturally, this attracted a lot of criticism from seasoned investors who partially blame Binance for exposing their investors to volatile assets. Despite the waning interest in individual projects, the meme coin ecosystem itself has reached a combined market capitalization of $110 billion, which represents about 3.44% of the $3.19 trillion crypto market. However, the sector has faced increasing scrutiny. On Nov. 25, Pump.fun, which is a decentralized platform for creating Solana-based meme coins, faced backlash after a user threatened suicide during a livestream. While the platform defended its moderation efforts, it ultimately removed the live streaming feature in response to the community’s concerns. Trader Turns $160 Into Millions with Solana Meme Coin Despite the risks associated with them, not all meme coins are bad. A Solana-based meme coin trader turned a $160 investment into millions by taking advantage of the popularity of a viral internet meme. Blockchain data from Solscan reveals that on Nov. 15, the trader bought Just a chill guy (CHILLGUY) meme coin tokens by making two transactions on Pump.fun. The initial investment included 0.50 Solana (SOL), worth approximately $107 at the time, in exchange for 9.6 million CHILLGUY tokens. This was followed by another purchase of 0.246 SOL, valued at $51, for 2.8 million tokens. CHILLGUY was launched on Nov. 15, and quickly gained momentum due to the viral success of the “Just a chill guy” meme. Its value surged, and hit a peak market cap of $643 million by Nov. 27. The trader sold 2.8 million tokens early for 149 SOL, or roughly $35,000, and ended up missing out on a potential profit of $1.6 million. However, the trader still holds 9.62 million tokens, which is currently valued at approximately $5.6 million. On the other hand, the success of CHILLGUY has not been without controversy. PhillipBankss, the artist behind the “Just a chill guy” character, is very unhappy with the unauthorized use of his artwork. On Nov. 21, he even announced that he plans to pursue takedowns for commercial use of the copyrighted character. Despite these objections, some members of the crypto community argue that enforcement against decentralized and anonymously launched tokens will be challenging. Others claim that the CHILLGUY token has now become a permanent fixture on the blockchain, regardless of the artist's opinions. Dogecoin Outpaces Porsche Meanwhile, Dogecoin recently surpassed the market cap of luxury automaker Porsche. This milestone was fueled by endorsements from Elon Musk and the anticipated launch of a Dogecoin-based exchange-traded product (ETP). Over the past month, Dogecoin surged by close to 147%, and reached a market cap of $57.8 billion on Nov. 27, overtaking Porsche’s $56.1 billion valuation. At press time, DOGE was worth about $0.4055, and its market cap settled at $59.63 billion. DOGE price action over the past month (Source: CoinMarketCap ) The meme coin’s momentum in 2024 was boosted by Musk’s continued social media support and his role in founding the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which is an agency that plans to reduce government spending and regulatory complexities. The agency’s acronym, which matches Dogecoin’s ticker symbol, caused a lot of excitement among retail investors. Dogecoin’s rise has also been supported by the launch of Valour DOGE ETP on Nov. 26. The ETP was announced by Valour, a subsidiary of DeFi Technologies. The asset manager decided to launch the ETP due to the increased interest in Dogecoin, driven by influential figures like Musk and the recent U.S. presidential election. Over the past year, Dogecoin’s market cap grew over 395%, which is in stark contrast to Porsche’s decline of more than 34%. Porsche was once valued at $117 billion in April of 2023, but its market cap fell to $56.1 billion. Market pattern analyst Trader Tardigrade suggested in an X post that Dogecoin is following a historical price trajectory that is based on the Gaussian channel. This channel is an indicator that is used to analyze price distribution. Some traders are forecasting a potential 1,000% rally for the meme coin.",NEGATIVE,DOGE,BLOCKCHAIN | DOGE | EXCHANGE | MARKET | BNB,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6286/australian-gamer-allegedly-behind-major-meme-coin-scandals,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

36946834,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=372609,1732784911,Bitwise Proposes New ETF Based on its 10 Crypto Index Fund,"Bitwise Asset Management has submitted a proposal to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a new exchange-traded fund (ETF) based on its existing 10 Crypto Index Fund. The ETF would include ten leading cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), XRP, Cardano (ADA), Avalanche (AVAX), Chainlink (LINK), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Polkadot (DOT), and Uniswap (UNI). Details of The Filing The fund is designed to reflect the prices of the ten assets in weighted proportions, providing investors with indirect exposure to the cryptocurrencies. Each asset in the crypto index ETF is allocated a specific share, with Bitcoin making up 75.1% of the index, Ethereum 16.5%, and Solana 4.3%. XRP accounts for 1.5%, followed by Cardano at 0.7%, Avalanche at 0.60%, and Chainlink and Bitcoin Cash at 0.4% each. Uniswap and Polkadot round out the index with allocations of 0.3% each. According to a November 27 filing , the Trust’s assets will be limited to portfolio assets and cash, with no plans to hold digital assets beyond those included in the portfolio. It also explicitly disclaimed ownership of any additional cryptocurrencies. The fund’s net asset value (NAV) will be calculated using pricing data from CF Benchmarks, which aggregates information from multiple cryptocurrency trading platforms. Coinbase Custody will oversee the crypto holdings, while the Bank of New York Mellon will act as custodian for cash reserves, administrator, and transfer agent. Meanwhile, the SEC acknowledged the application but did not indicate the decision timeline. Bitwise’s Market Moves Bitwise’s registration comes as the firm builds momentum in the crypto market. Earlier in November, the company crossed the $10 billion mark in assets under management (AUM), gaining an additional $1 billion in just 10 days. The asset manager has also expanded its ETF lineup. On November 26, it revealed that NYSE Arca had filed to list a combined Bitcoin and Ethereum ETP weighted by market capitalization. The following day, Bitwise rebranded its European XRP ETF as the Bitwise Physical XRP ETP. Ripple has also pledged to invest in the product. Further, the company joined the Solana ETF train earlier this month. On November 20, it registered a statutory trust in Delaware for a proposed spot Solana ETF, adding to its earlier filing for an XRP exchange-traded fund in the state. The recent election of Donald Trump to the U.S. presidency and the resignation notice of SEC Chair Gary Gensler have fueled optimism in the cryptocurrency sector. Many firms are capitalizing on this sentiment to push forward their crypto ETF proposals, with market expert Nate Geraci previously anticipating a wave of ETF filings following Trump’s triumph. However, challenges persist. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart recently warned that significant regulatory obstacles for altcoin ETFs could delay approval timelines.

The team claims the Open Network launch is close, with only 1 million more KYC completions needed to hit the 15 million target, though skepticism persists about further delays. Another Extension Pi Network – a cryptocurrency project that aims to allow people to mine digital assets directly from their smartphones – was launched in 2019. In the following years, it amassed a multi-million community, but some members have started doubting its legitimacy. For one, Pi Network has still not launched its native token and open mainnet. Earlier this year, the team assured that such developments would occur once all users had passed Know-Your-Customer (KYC) procedures. Initially, they had until late September to do so, but later, the period was extended to November 30. Most recently, Pi News (the leading blockchain media platform behind Pi Network) revealed the deadline to submit KYC applications (known as “the first Grace Period”) has been moved to December 31. “The final Grace Period deadline has not changed and is still December 31, 2024. This extension ensures all Pioneers have ample opportunity to secure their Pi while maintaining the overall timeframe of 6-month Grace Period unchanged. Submit your KYC application and complete your Mainnet Checklist by December 31, 2024, to avoid any forfeiture. Take action now – don’t wait,” the announcement reads. Somewhat expectedly , the latest extension caused mixed reactions. Some X users commenting on the post thanked for the provided details, while others called the project “a scam” due to the constant delays and broken promises. What About the Open Network? Pi Network’s team has indicated that the launch of the Open Network is also near. It claimed the development will see the light of day once 15 million people complete the necessary KYC verification. Earlier this month, Pi News disclosed that just 1 million individuals are needed to complete the target. Recently, the team shared important guidelines for migrating to the mainnet, highlighting that completing KYC procedures is only part of the process. Users are encouraged to set up and verify their wallets, sign the token confirmation agreement, and conduct additional steps on the checklist. “These steps can be completed before KYC , no need to wait. Please complete the migration within the grace period , otherwise your Pi may be considered abandoned and unusable,” the warning reads. Meanwhile, the community is waiting for December, when the Pi Core Team is supposed to share information on the open mainnet roadmap, which would enable official Pi token transactions. We have yet to see if everything will go as promised or if there will be another delay.

In its November 27 update to investors, MARA revealed that the purchase was executed in two phases: an initial buy of 5,771 BTC at an average price of $95,395 per coin, followed by an additional 703 BTC acquisition. The company’s Bitcoin treasury now stands at 34,797 BTC, valued at approximately $3.3 billion. Year-to-date, MARA’s per-share yield on Bitcoin is an impressive 36.7%, highlighting its strategic positioning in the evolving digital asset landscape. Beyond Bitcoin acquisitions, MARA has also repurchased a portion of its 2026 notes for $200 million, leaving roughly $160 million from its convertible debt raise. The remaining funds will be deployed to acquire Bitcoin during price dips , reflecting a commitment to leveraging market volatility. A Familiar Playbook: Corporate Debt for BTC MARA’s approach mirrors the strategy employed by MicroStrategy, a corporate pioneer in Bitcoin acquisition through debt financing. MicroStrategy, which began amassing Bitcoin in 2020 , has used similar methods, including a $3 billion senior convertible note issue at 0% interest. MicroStrategy’s latest spree saw the acquisition of 55,000 BTC between Nov. 18 and 24 at an average price of $97,862 per BTC, boosting its total holdings to a staggering 386,700 BTC. This makes MicroStrategy one of the largest corporate holders of the cryptocurrency. MARA’s $1 billion debt offering is part of its ambitious “21/21 Plan,” targeting $42 billion in funding over three years to secure additional Bitcoin and fortify its balance sheet. Risks and Criticism Loom While such aggressive strategies have attracted investor attention, they also invite scrutiny. Critics argue that using fiat-denominated debt to buy Bitcoin is inherently risky, particularly in volatile markets. MicroStrategy has faced similar skepticism, with its stock price plunging by 25% on Nov. 21 despite its growing Bitcoin portfolio. MARA’s approach, like MicroStrategy’s, could encounter significant financial strain if Bitcoin’s value experiences a sharp decline. However, with repayment obligations deferred until 2028, MARA has time to weather market fluctuations and potentially capitalize on Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory.

This month, nine prominent firms from sectors like finance, healthcare, and artificial intelligence (AI) have adopted Bitcoin as part of their treasury strategies. One of the standout adopters is Rumble , a video platform known for its conservative audience. The company announced plans to invest up to $20 million of its surplus cash in Bitcoin. CEO Chris Pavlovski cited Bitcoin’s ability to act as a hedge against inflation and its independence from government-controlled monetary systems. Similarly, LQR House , an e-commerce platform, plans to buy up to $1 million in Bitcoin to diversify its reserves and align with its new business strategy. Japanese energy and automotive firm Remixpoint also expanded its Bitcoin holdings, committing 500 million yen ($3.27 million), which will bring its total cryptocurrency reserves to approximately $22.92 million. In the AI sector, Genius Group increased its Bitcoin holdings by $4 million, raising its total to 153 BTC coins valued at $14 million. The company reaffirmed its “Bitcoin-first” strategy, pledging to allocate most of its reserves—eventually reaching $120 million—to BTC. The healthcare sector is also joining the trend. International Healthcare Group Cosmos recently integrated Bitcoin and Ethereum into its treasury. Hoth Therapeutics and Acurx Pharmaceuticals approved Bitcoin purchases of up to $1 million, citing its reliability as a long-term reserve asset amid growing institutional acceptance and the rollout of crypto ETFs in the U.S. Social media company Thumzup Media Corp announced a $1 million Bitcoin investment as part of its treasury strategy, highlighting BTC’s finite supply and inflation-resistant qualities. Similarly, Canadian tech firm Jiva Technologies revealed plans to invest up to $1 million in Bitcoin. CEO Lorne Rapkin described Bitcoin as a growing hedge against inflation and a crucial diversification tool for their financial holdings. These decisions reflect the increasing recognition of Bitcoin as a stable and valuable reserve asset across industries.

36946389,https://coinpaprika.com/news/trump-may-shift-crypto-oversight-to-cftc,1732783943,Trump May Shift Crypto Oversight to CFTC,"The incoming Donald Trump administration may shift crypto regulation from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), according to sources cited by Fox Business. This move could expand the CFTC’s authority over the $3 trillion digital asset market while reducing the SEC’s role. Under the Biden administration, SEC Chair Gary Gensler faced criticism for classifying most cryptocurrencies, except Bitcoin, as securities, creating barriers for the industry. His “regulation-by-enforcement” strategy has been unpopular among crypto participants. Trump’s presidency signals a potential policy change, with plans to create a more crypto-friendly regulatory framework. A recent Texas court ruling overturning the SEC’s broker-dealer rule adds to the momentum for change. The Trump administration reportedly plans to give the CFTC broader authority to oversee digital assets, including regulating exchanges and spot markets for commodities like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Former CFTC Chair Chris Giancarlo stated the agency could “start regulating digital commodities from day one” if adequately funded and led effectively. Giancarlo is also a candidate for a new “crypto czar” role, which would involve shaping policy and leading an advisory council. Trump’s campaign positioned the U.S. as a potential “crypto capital of the world” , with plans to appoint regulators supportive of digital assets. Asset managers like Bitwise and WisdomTree see this as an opportunity for the approval of cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Additionally, Trump’s transition team is exploring a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) to address inflation and economic uncertainty, an idea supported by firms like BlackRock. Globally, similar initiatives are emerging. In Brazil , a proposed bill aims to create a national Bitcoin reserve to diversify treasury holdings. Trump’s incoming administration could mark a significant turning point for cryptocurrency regulation, offering a more supportive environment for innovation and growth in the digital asset sector.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/trump-may-shift-crypto-oversight-to-cftc,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/36946389.jpeg

Sources close to Trump’s team suggest Atkins, a former Republican SEC commissioner during George W. Bush’s presidency, has been interviewed for the position. This development comes as the Trump administration signals plans to take a crypto-friendly approach to regulation. Outgoing SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, who will step down in January, faced criticism for his aggressive regulatory stance, particularly in the cryptocurrency space. His tenure saw intense scrutiny on digital assets, following high-profile collapses such as the FTX exchange. Many in the industry viewed his enforcement-heavy strategy as unclear and stifling for innovation. Atkins, known for his balanced regulatory philosophy, could represent a significant shift in the SEC’s approach. Atkins’ career includes founding Patomak Global Partners, a financial consulting firm, and working closely with former SEC Chairs Richard C. Breeden and Arthur Levitt. This experience has provided him with deep insight into the agency’s operations and policy-making. Under Trump, Atkins is expected to promote policies that encourage growth in the cryptocurrency sector while maintaining oversight of traditional markets. Trump has already pledged to appoint crypto-friendly regulators and even proposed the creation of a strategic Bitcoin reserve—a vision that aligns with Atkins’ outlook. Although Atkins is the frontrunner, other candidates are being considered, including current SEC Commissioner Mark Uyeda, former Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman Heath Tarbert, and Robert Stebbins of Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP. However, insiders suggest Atkins is favored within Trump’s inner circle, with discussions reportedly taking place at Mar-a-Lago to shape the administration’s regulatory agenda. The potential leadership change at the SEC comes at a critical time for the crypto industry. The shift from Gensler’s enforcement-driven policies to a more innovation-supportive approach could revive confidence among crypto entrepreneurs and investors. Republican policymakers have referred to this shift as a return to the “gold standard” of SEC operations, aiming to balance effective oversight with industry growth. Atkins’ leadership could prioritize fostering innovation in the digital asset space , offering clearer regulatory guidance while continuing to combat fraud and insider trading. Fox journalist Eleanor Terret highlighted Atkins’ broader expertise, noting that he is well-versed in the SEC’s oversight of the $100 trillion securities market. This makes him an ideal candidate to navigate both the traditional financial sector and the rapidly evolving digital economy. While most of Trump’s cabinet positions have already been announced, the SEC appointment remains pending, with announcements expected soon. A change in leadership at the SEC could significantly impact the future of crypto regulation , potentially opening the door to policies that strike a better balance between investor protection and technological progress.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/paul-atkins-tipped-to-lead-pro-crypto-shift-at-sec,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/36946233.jpeg

One billion tokens will be issued, with 31% going to users who earned points in a campaign that ended in May. A further 23.8% will be set aside for current and future core contributors, the latter of which will be locked for one year.  HyperLiquid has more than 220,000 users and has racked up $2.4 billion in trading volume over the past 24 hours.  Points campaigns have become increasingly common in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector this year as they incentivize the use of the platform in return for eventual token airdrops. They have even spurred the birth of airdrop farmers, investors who move liquidity from one project to another in order to be eligible for various airdrops.  Unlike a standard governance token, HYPE will have numerous functions including staking capabilities and a payment method for gas fees.

This move, paired with Binance’s announcement to delist the GFT/USDT trading pair by December 10, 2024, triggered a significant sell-off and raised serious concerns among investors. The delisting, part of Binance’s broader removal of eight altcoin trading pairs, has fueled market panic and distrust. The GFT token's troubles began on November 26 when Binance revealed its plans to delist the token. This announcement led to a 25% drop in GFT’s value , as investors reacted to the reduced liquidity and accessibility. Delistings from major exchanges often result in panic selling, and GFT was no exception. However, the situation worsened when the Gifto team reportedly minted and dumped 1.2 billion new tokens, worth $8.6 million, into the market just days later. According to Web3 analytics platform Lookonchain, Gifto minted the tokens over an eight-hour period and deposited them into exchanges. This move coincided with an additional 40% crash in GFT’s market value . Many in the crypto community have criticized this as a blatant disregard for investors, accusing Gifto of using the delisting as an opportunity for an “exit strategy.” One user on X (formerly Twitter) called it a “classic Web2 move,” highlighting the risks of centralized token management and urging a shift toward decentralized systems. Binance’s delisting decision is part of its regular review process, where underperforming or risky tokens are removed to maintain market integrity. Alongside GFT, other tokens facing removal include IRISnet (IRIS), SelfKey (KEY), OAX (OAX), and Ren (REN). For affected tokens, delisting often results in a sharp decline in value, reduced liquidity, and diminished investor confidence. These challenges raise doubts about the long-term survival of such projects, as they lose the visibility and trading volume that large exchanges like Binance provide. Gifto’s decision to mint and dump tokens has added to the backlash, with retail investors, often the slowest to respond, bearing the brunt of the losses. Critics argue that centralized control over token supply allows for such actions, highlighting the need for decentralized alternatives. This incident serves as a cautionary tale about the risks of centralized crypto projects , where poor decision-making and lack of transparency can devastate investors. For GFT holders, the future remains uncertain. As December 10 approaches, the combination of Binance’s delisting and Gifto’s controversial actions has left the community in turmoil. The event underscores the vulnerabilities of tokens overly reliant on centralized exchanges and raises questions about their long-term viability. Investors are now looking to decentralized finance (DeFi) and decentralized exchanges (DEXs) as more secure and transparent options. The Gifto saga serves as a stark reminder of the importance of trust and transparency in the crypto space. For now, GFT holders are left grappling with a rapidly declining asset and an uncertain path forward. Binance’s delisting decision and Gifto’s actions have created a perfect storm , leaving many retail investors at a disadvantage.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/gifto-sparks-chaos-with-token-dump-ahead-of-binance-delisting,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/36946041.jpeg

The last show I was a part of with BitBasel was still held in the Miami Bitcoin Center in 2019, so returning to exhibit with these pioneers is precious. I had also no idea just how predictive my keynote back then was going to be about what is going to be shown now. It’s groundhog day with bananas and a repetition of Dante’s circles of hell, while trying to help humanity out of inverse mode. A worthy fight. Legends only 🚀 As crazy as this journey has been since the early days, needing to repeat some fundamentals time and time again, while the ETH scene erodes further, luckily there are people who see what I do and support the perspective to be a part of it all. Much gratitude for Lecks and Scarlett for including me in the 2024 show. Back to the Future Notice what is on screen during my lecture about all things decentralised in 2019 at BitBasel Back then, I was commenting a lot on how the world is on fire, how we need to fix the monetary system, the origin story of creativity, how AI will replace most low-end lawyers, accountants, etc., within five years, and how the banana fuckery of the art world couldn’t possibly sink any lower. Man, was I wrong—again—on that one. It seems the art world has found new ways to hit rock bottom in the Web3 space. At least then, SuperRare was still just taking off with hope. My naive self still believed back then that blockchain was going to bring more transparency to the art world. LOL. Anyhoo, both the divine touch and the banana were featured in my slides during the presentation, and now they will be part of the 2024 BitBasel as a combined artwork. The piece comments on how the West has lost its way and explores what we can do to revitalize it. The reverse of the great inverse is the avant-garde, and I keep being here for it. Eventually, this will be seen by everyone and recognized as self-evident. In the meanwhile, I gotta double up as an artist as well as a culture critic. It’s a weird position but someone’s gotta do it. I’m Potency I’m Potency will be on show, infamous now from the precious SuperRare debacle. The NFT comes with a physical canvas print, painted over with acrylics, which launches an AR animation. I wrote an article here called “Proof of censorship” recently on the substance. Here is the longer original tweet as my “submission” for the competition. Price 6 ETH BitRam! See if the scanning works via the Artivive app! The second piece on show is the live version NFT of the BitRam artwork re-imagining the animal lore of Bitcoin a bit. BTC keeps trucking along, breaking new number heights, but most importantly fighting to have an alternate space marked safe from the fiat inflation machine. The animation original piece comes with a 2/3 physical, hand finished canvas art piece that launches into an AR version via the Artivive app. Price: 9 ETH BitRam physical re-paint (sold 1/3) on show in Switzerland at the Swiss Web3 Conf earlier in 2024 during Art Basel. 2/3 is now available and married together with the 1/1 animation NFT on sale at BitBasel. Renaissance 360 Lecks also asked me to get some metaverse material on a screen, which I was happy about. The compilation video of some of the best made thus far through Asvoria (launching soon), Superworld and Cornerstone Land will be presented as part of a larger metaverse reel. Why are we not allowed to ask, in art, the most basic of questions. Why can’t we be inspired by excellence, beauty, harmony and the spirit? Time after time, we just revel in this mud like pigs with no future. At least the pigs derive some nutrients and skin care from their play, whilst we just reduce ourselves to animals with no instincts.

The 2/3 re-paint is still available now priced at 1 BTC. I kept the idea I had that some of the early works will keep the thread to the 1 BTC price, when bought from me. Of course, I needed start making others without it, as about 10k remains the constant “fuck you money” that people in the scene use for art. These piece are historic though, so if you want in on that action, I solute you! I saved it here as the last thing, so it’s only through proof of collector effort, that you even get to them. Also, forever respect for Moe Levin, the founder of the North American Bitcoin Conference, for giving me my first ever spot to showcase my art in January 2018. Cool to have a fren also in Joel from the Bad Crypto Podcast, who is lurking there in the background 😂 The 1/50 signed print was given to Moe as a gift.

This fund includes ten leading cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin , Ethereum, Solana, XRP, Cardano, Avalanche, Chainlink, Bitcoin Cash, Polkadot, and Uniswap. If approved, it would become the most diverse crypto ETF available in the U.S. market. The SEC's acknowledgment of the filing marks the start of a regulatory review process, with a countdown to either approve or reject the application. Although no specific deadline has been confirmed, this development reflects the growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies within U.S. financial regulation. Recent approvals for Bitcoin ETF options trading have fueled optimism in the market. BitWise has been operating its 10 Crypto Index Fund since 2018, designed to track the value of the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. This move aligns with the company’s strategy to capitalize on increasing institutional interest in crypto assets. Earlier this year, BitWise launched a Bitcoin ETF (BITB) and filed for a Solana ETF, joining other firms like Canary Capital, VanEck, and 21Shares in expanding their crypto-focused offerings. In addition to its U.S. ambitions, BitWise is also exploring international markets. The firm recently filed for an XRP exchange-traded product (ETP) in Europe. These efforts indicate BitWise’s commitment to establishing a prominent presence in the rapidly evolving crypto investment landscape. The inclusion of Cardano (ADA) in the 10 Crypto Index Fund has sparked speculation in the crypto community. Some believe ADA’s recent price surge may be linked to large-scale purchases for ETF purposes. Influencer Big Pey highlighted this on X (formerly Twitter), noting Cardano is the fund's fifth-largest asset. This has led to further excitement among investors anticipating potential market shifts if the ETF is approved. The SEC's evolving stance on cryptocurrency ETFs, under new leadership, signals a broader shift in U.S. financial policy. The industry could see a wave of more diverse crypto-related investment products as regulators become more accommodating. This growing friendliness to the crypto industry reflects increasing recognition of its role in global finance.

After its remarkable performance, the latest internet sensation continues to grow in popularity, recently scoring two major exchange listings. Related Reading: Polygon: Analyst Sets ‘Wild’ Price Target Amid POL’s 38.2% Weekly Surge Just A Chill Rise To $0.65 This cycle’s memecoin mania has seen the rise and fall of many tokens in the last few months, including the Celebrity token frenzy and the recent Pump.fun Livestream saga, sparking a discussion on whether they benefit the market. Despite the criticism, new tokens continue to rise, with some leaping into massive highs in a matter of days. The latest memecoin sensation, just a chill guy (CHILLGUY), has ignited a craze that sent the token to a massive 80% weekly rally. The cryptocurrency is based on a viral TikTok meme of a smirking dog in a laid-back pose dressed in casual clothing. The original drawing was created by Philip Banks in 2023 and has been slowly gaining popularity on social media platforms. The meme also became viral on X and Instagram, with several reimaginations of the ‘Chill Guy’ flooding people’s timelines. Amid the meme’s popularity boost, crypto investors created a token inspired by the internet sensation. On November 20, the meme’s momentum fueled the token’s 400% rally to $0.44 in 24 hours. However, its price momentarily dropped over 30% after Banks announced he would take legal action against the token for copyright infringement. Since then, the memecoin has surged around 50% to its all-time high (ATH), recording two new highs during the last day. The token hit the $0.56 mark on Tuesday afternoon before surging another 20% to its latest ATH of $0.65 on Wednesday morning. The cryptocurrency hit a market capitalization of $657 million before retracing below $600 million, sitting as the eighth-largest Solana-based memecoin. Memecoin Sensation Scores Major Listings The token’s frenzy has been fueled by the meme’s current popularity and its endorsement by public figures. A week ago, El Salvador’s pro-Bitcoin President, Nayib Bukele, shared the just a chill guy meme as BTC traded above $94,000 for the first time in history. Moreover, Popular YouTuber Mr. Beast called the internet sensation the “biggest meme of our lifetime” after streamer Ninja shared his version of the meme on Tuesday. Adding to the momentum, major crypto exchanges have announced their listing of the latest memecoin sensation. On November 26, Bybit listed CHILLGUY on their Spot trading platform, while Binance announced it would add perpetual contracts with up to 75x leverage to Binance Futures on November 27. Amid the CHILLGUY frenzy, an investor made over $6 million from the token. As on-chain data analytics firm Lookonchain reported, a crypto trader spent 0.75 SOL, worth $160, to buy 12.5 million CHILLGUY tokens. Related Reading: Altcoins ‘Starting To Run’ After Reclaiming This Key Level, Altseason Around The Corner? Twelve days later, the trader now holds 9.2 million tokens, making a total profit of $6.1 million at the time of Lookonchain’s report. Some community members noted that if the cryptocurrency continues its rapid growth, it could flip other memecoin sensations like dogwifhat (WIF) and Popcat (POPCAT) within a week. However, it remains to be seen whether the token can sustain its current momentum or become a one-hit crypto wonder. As of this writing, CHILLGUY trades at $0.59, a 23.3% increase in the daily timeframe.

Retail customers can seamlessly trade top cryptocurrencies in HKD and USD through the bank's app. The platform currently supports trading exclusively for Bitcoin and Ethereum. Hong Kong’s first and largest virtual bank now enables retail users to buy Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) directly using fiat, including HKD and USD. The move makes ZA Bank the first in Asia to offer crypto trading services directly to users. Retail Users Can Now Trade Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) Hong Kong’s first and largest digital bank, ZA Bank, has become Asia’s first bank to offer cryptocurrency trading services directly to retail users. Through the bank’s app, users can seamlessly trade top crypto in fiat currencies on a single platform. Retail users no longer need to switch between apps or platforms to enjoy this service. In its announcement , ZA Bank said the platform offers “cryptocurrency” trading services but noted it “currently supports trading services exclusively for Bitcoin and Ethereum.” It is still unclear whether the platform will include support for other cryptocurrencies in future. With the launch of this service, the virtual bank explained it simplifies the entire investment process and “cements its leadership in digital wealth management by merging traditional banking with the future of finance.” ZA Bank Capitalizes on the Global Surge in Crypto Demand The global demand for cryptocurrencies and crypto-related services has surged, with users reaching 500 million by mid-2024. According to ZA Bank, this surge represents a 30% year-on-year increase, and the crypto market capitalization has increased nearly 90%, now measuring $2.3 trillion. Moreover, a recent survey by the Hong Kong Association of Banks revealed that almost 70% of respondents believe that if banks offer virtual asset trading services, trading will be more convenient and could aid in adopting and popularising crypto trading. ZA Bank’s landmark decision to offer crypto trading services places it firmly in the spotlight, and regulators will undoubtedly look at it with increased scrutiny. Calvin Ng, Alternate Chief Executive of ZA Bank, commented on the move and assured it would comply with the necessary regulatory measures. In a statement, Ng said: “The rise of cryptocurrency presents investors with more diverse asset allocation opportunities. As a bank, we prioritise security and compliance, which is why we’ve partnered with HashKey, a global-leading licensed virtual asset exchange, to meet regulatory standards and deliver bank-grade security in virtual assets trading - our key competitive advantage in the Asian market.” Last year, Hashkey became the first crypto platform in Hong Kong to upgrade its type 1 and type 7 licenses, allowing it to serve retail customers. Global Demand for Crypto Skyrockets in Anticipation of Trump Administration’s Pro-Crypto Policies The recent victory of Donald Trump in the US presidential election has renewed interest and optimism in the crypto market, driven by expected pro-crypto policies under Trump’s incoming administration. Since securing a landmark win over the democratic candidate, Kamala Harris, Bitcoin (BTC) surged to record highs, nearly hitting the $100,000 mark with a high of $99,655 . Market sentiment became overwhelmingly bullish following Trump’s win, further encouraged by the announcement of the imminent resignation of Gary Gensler, Chair of the SEC . Since becoming President-elect, Donald Trump has made numerous crypto-friendly moves. The social media company owned by Trump is reportedly in the process of buying crypto trading firm Bakkt , and the President-elect is considering creating the first-ever crypto-specific role in the White House. News emerged that the incoming administration is also mulling handing over the regulation of crypto exchanges and spot markets for cryptocurrencies deemed commodities to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), likely driven by the SEC’s relentless crusade on the crypto industry under Gensler’s reign.

This Bitcoin Layer-2 Will Use DOGE for Yields,"Bitcoin layer-2 network GOAT will soon let dogecoin (DOGE) users stake their tokens to earn fixed yields in BTC, with plans for additional memecoin-based financial applications later for users to earn “even greater rewards” on DOGE holdings.   GOAT Network, whose mainnet is yet to be released, has so far let users lock up BTC to earn network rewards in a process colloquially called staking. The network’s ecosystem — when built — will let bitcoin holders participate in various decentralized finance (DeFi), such as lending or trading, without giving up ownership of their assets.    DOGE prices have more than doubled in the past 30 days on an Elon Musk-linked trade and the virality of non-governmental agency Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.)    Besides its “long, colorful, and wildly successful history,” the GOAT Network team said it chose dogecoin for its strong “community vibe that has now a U.S. government agency called D.O.G.E. named after it,” and the coin being “ready for the next phase of its journey.”    “This way, Dogecoin investors can weather the volatility of crypto without paper-handing DOGE before its time has come and, in the process, earn digital gold, which is now being adopted by corporations, institutions, and nation-states,” the team said in a release shared with CoinDesk. “So, by adding Dogecoin to its rapidly-growing ecosystem, GOAT Network is positioning itself as the ‘home of The People’s Coins.”    Bitcoin DeFi has surged in the past months on various catalysts. Just a month ago, the total value locked (TVL) in the space was near $900 million, which has now surged past $4 billion, per DefiLlama data.    GOAT Network uses a system (called a sequencer) where transactions are sorted and grouped off the main blockchain before being sent there for final processing. To operate a node in this system, an entity needs to lock up at least 100 BTC. However, those with smaller holdings can still link their assets to a sequencer to help run the network and earn yields.",POSITIVE,BTC | DOGE,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | DOGE | FIAT,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/11/28/looking-to-earn-more-on-dogecoin-this-bitcoin-layer-2-will-use-doge-for-yields,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4c5a253acfede39012d282e82fa00a50cf8cf434-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Daily and weekly chart analyses show strong uptrends with no resistance, indicating potential for further stock appreciation despite recent pullbacks. Fundamental analysis reveals overvaluation with weak earnings and high P/S and P/B ratios, suggesting long-term risks despite bullish technical signals. Conflicting technical and fundamental signals lead to a hold rating, cautioning shorts about potential near-term bullish momentum before fundamentals reassert. Thesis Citron Research recently announced that they are now shorting MicroStrategy Incorporated ( MSTR ) stock as they believe that it is detached from fundamentals. While I also believe the stock is currently overvalued, in my view, Citron Research is playing with fire by shorting the stock as the technicals are overwhelmingly bullish. In the below analysis, I determine that charts, moving averages, and most indicators show that the stock's outlook is positive and that the recent pullback is a healthy correction in the long run. Note that a monthly analysis has not been provided, as I believe the 2020 to present period is the most relevant due to MicroStrategy's implementation of its Bitcoin strategy in 2020. In the fundamentals section, I explain my evaluation that MicroStrategy stock is overvalued using the P/S and P/B ratios as well as trends in their earnings and Bitcoin investments. In the long run, the stock may revert to reflecting the fundamentals and could prove Citron Research to be right. However, before that occurs, history has shown that overvalued stocks can become much more overvalued. With highly bullish technicals, history can easily repeat itself with MicroStrategy stock. With the stock significantly overvalued, I cannot recommend buying it at these levels, but with the technicals so strong, I also believe a sell rating is unwarranted at this juncture. Therefore, I initiate coverage at a hold rating. Daily Analysis Chart Analysis Yahoo Finance The daily chart is quite a positive one for MicroStrategy as there is no resistance above the stock. The stock is in both a slightly longer-term uptrend and a recent accelerated uptrend. It also has many support levels beneath the stock. The nearest current support would be the accelerated uptrend line that has moved past 400 and is sloping up very quickly. Its sustainability could be in question as its trajectory may be too steep. The next support level is also quite close and is in the mid-380s. In the last week or so, that level has been both resistance and support, making it a highly important zone. Moving down, the mid-320s is also support, as there is a consolidation area that found support at that price level. Although quite distant, we also have support in the mid-270s as that was an upside gap and the slower uptrend line is also nearing that level as well. Other noteworthy items include the fact that the stock has closed an upside gap that I have circled, showing that the stock has corrected as of late, and the bearish engulfing pattern at the peak a few days ago, perhaps indicating that a near term peak is in. Nonetheless, it is hard to argue against the overall bullishness of the daily chart as the stock is in strong uptrends with no resistance in sight. Moving Average Analysis Yahoo Finance There have been no crossovers between the 50-day SMA and the 200-day SMA in the past year, with the 50-day SMA staying on top the entire time, indicating sustained bullishness. The 50-day SMA has recently widened the gap significantly with the 200-day SMA, indicating accelerating bullish momentum in the stock. The stock does trade miles above the 50-day SMA, however, as the 50-day SMA's support is only at around 240. For the Bollinger Bands, the stock recently broke above the upper band, and so the current pullback is not at all surprising. As volatility expands, the upper band may continue to surge higher, creating more room for the stock to run higher without being overbought. The 20-day midline is the nearest MA support at around 320. Overall, I believe that while the stock may be a bit overbought as it is much higher than its 50-day SMA, there are really no outright bearish indications here to convince me that the near term technicals have turned negative. Indicator Analysis Yahoo Finance The MACD crossed above the signal line earlier this month, a bullish signal. The gap between the lines has narrowed a bit, as indicated by the red histogram, showing that bullishness has been receding a bit as of late. This is not surprising given that the stock is currently in an overbought pullback. The MACD's run to one year highs also confirms the latest surge in the stock. For the RSI, it is currently at 64.39 having just exited the overbought 70 level. The RSI has held above 50 since mid-September, showing that the bulls are in clear control of the stock. Lastly, for the stochastics, the %K just recently crossed below the %D within the overbought 80 zone, a bearish signal. This again is not surprising given that the stock is undergoing an overbought correction. Note that the stochastics has remained above the 50 level since mid-September and has, in fact, found support at that level multiple times. This indicates that the bulls have been resilient in recent pullbacks, and investors should monitor this indicator closely to see if it bounces from this level again. As a whole, I would say that these indicators were mainly positive in the longer term, as the recent bearish indications are merely reflecting the stock's healthy pullback. Takeaway The short-term technical outlook for MicroStrategy is a strong one, as all three analyses indicate that the stock could run further in the near future. The chart shows that the stock remains in both a slower and an accelerated uptrend, while the MAs show accelerating bullish momentum. Lastly, for the indicators, as discussed above, there were key bullish signals and while there were some near-term bearish signals, they merely reflect the recent healthy pullback in the stock. Weekly Analysis Chart Analysis Yahoo Finance Note that the above chart is in a log scale to better reflect the last few years of trading history in MicroStrategy stock. The weekly chart is also a highly positive one for the stock, as it has now broken above the upper channel line and is in an accelerated uptrend. The upward channel has been in effect since early 2023 and in October this year, the stock broke above it, an indication of strength. The nearest support level would be at a gap in the low 270s. This is basically the same gap as in the daily analysis, but being on the weekly chart further adds to its significance. The next support level would be the upper channel line, and it has just moved past 210. The other two support zones are very distant due to the log scale, but I believe are still noteworthy. The lower channel line is approaching 130 and there is also a support level at 110 as that price level was major resistance in 2021 and is also at an upside gap formed earlier this year, making it a very significant area. Overall, I believe there is not much to complain about here, as there are no bearish indications to be seen. Moving Average Analysis Yahoo Finance The 13-week SMA had a bullish crossover with the 26-week SMA earlier this year where the 13-week SMA just dipped below the 26-week SMA and bounced back very quickly. The gap between the SMAs has expanded rapidly lately as the stock has surged, indicating accelerating bullish momentum. Again, the stock trades far above the SMAs, showing that it could be overbought with the 13-week SMA's support at only 237. For the Bollinger Bands, the stock remains above the upper band, showing that it is indeed still overbought in the longer term time frame. Therefore, a further pullback in the stock is definitely not out of the question and could, in fact, be healthy for the stock's long-term trend. The 20-week midline is only at around 206, but its support is nearer than the 26-week SMA. From my analysis, there is nothing wrong with MicroStrategy stock in the long term, even if it continues its recent pullback. The MAs are solidly bullish, and the stock just needs a healthy correction. Indicator Analysis Yahoo Finance The MACD had a bullish crossover with the signal line back in late September, and the stock has surged since then. The gap between the lines continues to expand as demonstrated by the green histogram and again shows accelerating bullish momentum. Like in the daily analysis, the weekly MACD's run to 5-year highs, confirms the recent surge in the stock. For the RSI, it is currently above the overbought 70 zone as it is at 80.41. There is some slight negative divergence with the RSI here, as the most recent peak fails to surpass the peak earlier this year and the one back in 2021. Since the MACD does confirm the recent run, I believe this divergence signal has less significance and should be taken with a grain of salt. Lastly, for the stochastics, the %K has crossed below %D within the overbought 80 zone in October, a bearish indication. However, both lines have generally remained in or near that zone since the bearish crossover, showing that bullishness has been sustained despite the negative signal. From my analysis, these weekly indicators are slightly more mixed in their signalling as there are both bullish and bearish indications here, but I believe the MACD's confirmation of the bull run should give investors some peace of mind. Takeaway Overall, I would say that the long-term technical outlook for MicroStrategy is also positive, as the vast majority of signals are bullish. The charts show that the stock has broken out of an upward channel and is now in an accelerated uptrend, while the MAs once again show accelerating bullish momentum. For the indicators, there were mixed signals that show some uncertainty, but as discussed above, I would consider the MACD's bullish confirmation as the most important signal. Fundamentals & Valuation Earnings Data by YCharts MicroStrategy reported their Q3 earnings back in late October and showed weak operating results. They reported revenues of $116.1 million, down 10.3% YoY and a GAAP Net Loss of $1.72 per share. Both figures missed expectations with revenue missing by $5.38 million and EPS missing by $1.60. As you can see in the charts above, revenue is at weak levels compared to past years and EPS is on a worrying trajectory. Of course, these operational results have taken a back seat as the focus is firmly on the company's Bitcoin investments. MicroStrategy reported a 5.1% ""BTC Yield"" KPI in the quarter and projected a target annual BTC Yield of 6-10% from 2025 to 2027. It also announced a $21 billion equity offering at market price and an additional raising of $21 billion from fixed-income securities to fund its Bitcoin investments. As of this report, they are holding 252,220 Bitcoins, translating into a current total market value of $23.5 billion. The company has made significant purchases since then with the most recent purchases occurring last week, where they purchased an additional 55,000 Bitcoins. As of this latest Sunday, they hold 386,700 Bitcoins, translating into a current total market value of $36.1 billion. From the chart above, you can see that the company's book value has soared in the past two years along with the bull run in Bitcoin itself. Valuation Data by YCharts In my view, it is clear that MicroStrategy is overvalued at current levels. Earnings are now negative, and so a P/E analysis would be irrelevant. The P/S ratio is currently at 167, dropping slightly from its all-time highs of over 180 recently. The P/B ratio is currently at 24 and is at a five-year-high, excluding the 2021-2022 spike. As I said earlier, of course, the focus has shifted to Bitcoin, but the company's current market cap of $76 billion shows that its Bitcoin holdings of $36.1 billion are just a portion of the value. Therefore, the P/S should still be a relevant measure of value for the stock and so with revenues near five-year lows, I believe the current P/S ratio is unjustified. For the P/B ratio, MicroStrategy started to buy Bitcoin back in 2020 and has been increasing their holdings since then, which deserves a premium, but the P/B ratio is now at approximately 2 times the five-year average, excluding the 2021 spike. Despite their aggressive strategy, I, personally, find the P/B ratio of over 24 to be too rich. From my analysis of the P/S and P/B ratios, I believe the stock is overvalued at current levels. For MicroStrategy stock, Seeking Alpha currently has an F valuation rating for the P/S ratio and a D- rating for the P/B ratio, confirming my evaluation. Conclusion From the above analysis, it is clear that the technicals differ highly with the fundamentals on their outlooks for the stock. The vast majority of technical indications were bullish as the chart showed the stock is in accelerated uptrends while MAs show strong bullish momentum. While indicators were a bit more mixed overall, there were key signals of strength that confirm the recent surge in the stock. For the fundamentals, with revenue being very sluggish, I find the stock to be overvalued in terms of the P/S ratio and while the increasingly large Bitcoin pile deserves a P/B expansion, I believe the ratio has gone too far currently as it is at an eye-watering level of 24. I therefore conclude that the stock is significantly overvalued at current levels. While the stock could revert to reflecting its fundamentals in the long run and prove Citron Research to be right in the long run, in the near term, I believe the stock could have room to run due to the technicals being heavily in MicroStrategy's favour. With conflicting technical and fundamental signals, I initiate the stock at a hold rating, but I believe shorts are at a high risk of being burned before their predictions come true.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4740856-microstrategy-shorts-are-playing-fire-technical-analysis?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/36945007.jpeg

Research from CryptoQuant, published on November 27, highlights that the cryptocurrency is far from reaching overvaluation levels typically observed during market peaks. Analysts are projecting a potential price target of $146,000 for this cycle. Bitcoin Accumulation Pattern A key factor supporting this outlook is the relatively low activity among retail investors. Historically, bull cycles have peaked when retail participation surges, accounting for over 80% to 90% of total holdings. In contrast, current retail holdings stand at just over 50%, indicating that the market has yet to reach its speculative zenith. Since October, retail investors have reduced their holdings by 41,000 BTC, while institutional and large-scale players have added 130,000 BTC to their portfolios. “This trend suggests a shift in market dynamics, with institutional investors taking the lead in the accumulation phase,” CryptoQuant analysts noted. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have been instrumental in this trend, with Bitcoin-related ETFs seeing record weekly inflows of $3.1 billion by November 22, when Bitcoin briefly touched $99,655.50. Price Corrections and Long-Term Projections Although Bitcoin’s price has dipped to around $91,000 as of November 26—failing to breach the $100,000 resistance level—analysts caution that a correction of up to 30% could precede the next leg of the rally. Such pullbacks have historically marked consolidation phases in Bitcoin’s bull runs, providing the foundation for further growth. CryptoQuant’s bull-bear market cycle indicator has remained firmly in bullish territory since early November but has yet to reach the overheated levels last seen in March 2024, when Bitcoin surpassed $70,000. This suggests that the current rally is still in its early stages. From a realized price valuation perspective, Bitcoin’s top price target stands around $150,000 , precisely $146,000. CryptoQuant’s report states that this price band has historically acted as a peak in previous cycles, such as in April-May 2021. “The P&L Index has not yet reached overvalued levels, indicating the price still has room to grow,” the report states. As institutional investors continue to dominate the market, the narrative around Bitcoin’s long-term potential strengthens. With metrics pointing to untapped upside and retail activity yet to peak, the stage is set for Bitcoin to aim for new all-time highs in this cycle.

According to a Nov. 27 announcement , the attacker managed to acquire the private keys to the Pump Science offchain wallet linked to its profile on Pump.fun through a GitHub leak, enabling the creation of fraudulent tokens such as Urolithin B through to E (URO) and Cocaine (COKE) under the Pump Science official profile. Pump Science’s platform focuses on creating tokens tied to longevity medicine research. The project describes itself as a gamified longevity research initiative and aims to connect token holders with intellectual property rights for chemical compounds. It allows token holders to sell “intervention” rights to suppliers, integrating research and commerce. Rifampicin (RIF) and Urolithin A (URO) are the only two tokens the project has launched. Rifampin, an antibiotic, is used to treat tuberculosis, while Urolithin A is studied for its potential to enhance mitochondrial function and muscle health. Prices of both RIF and URO tanked over 25% following the exploit. Pump Science has advised users to avoid buying or interacting with any new tokens originating from the “pscience PumpFun profile,” warning that the attacker still has access to the compromised wallet. You might also like: Binance Labs invests in DeSci platform BIO Protocol Based on the post-attack report, the leak occurred due to private keys tied to the profile being inadvertently published in the project’s GitHub codebase. Pump Science said the leak stemmed from an oversight on the part of BuilderZ, a Solana-based software development behind the development of the project, for leaving the private key for the offchain wallet “T5j2U…jb8sc” in its GitHub codebase. “[BuilderZ] left the private key to T5j in the codebase thinking that it was not the dev wallet, which it wasn’t, but this appeared so on the http://pump.fun front end due to the free token creation feature,” the project wrote. Pump Science has renamed its Pump.fun profile to “dont_trust” and is collaborating with blockchain security firm Blockaid to flag fraudulent mints originating from the compromised address to avoid further exploitation. To address security concerns, the platform has vowed to do multiple consultative audits, an open competitive audit with Code4rena, and penetration testing. They will also launch a bug bounty program to continue to battle test its platform and confirmed it will no longer launch tokens on Pump.fun . Meanwhile, the community has criticized the project’s handling of the breach, with some users labeling it a scam and others questioning its operational competence.

One token, however, is still blazing hot: Solana-based decentralized exchange Raydium's native cryptocurrency, RAY.  As the only coin with annualized perpetual funding rates still exceeding 160%, RAY stands out among the small, mid and large-cap tokens as the most overheated cryptocurrency, according to data from VeloData. The elevated rate suggests the market for RAY is overcrowded with long positions, with leverage skewed heavily toward the bullish side.  In such conditions, even a slight dip in price can shake the confidence of over-leveraged bulls, especially late entrants, triggering a mass unwinding of long positions, which often exacerbates the price decline, leading to a more pronounced sell-off. Tokens with a market capitalization of less than $5 billion, such as RAY, are particularly vulnerable to shenanigans in the derivatives market.  It's easy to see why bulls have thrown caution to the wind. Despite the recent 17% price pullback to $5.39, RAY is still up 67% for the month versus market leader BTC's 35% surge, CoinDesk data show.   The market-beating rise comes amid record activity on Raydium. According to data source Artemis, Raydium has registered a trading volume of $117.8 billion this month, nearly twice the entire Ethereum-based DEX volume of $66.8 billion. Raydium has generated $175 million in fees versus Ethereum's $168 million. Ethereum is the world's largest smart contract blockchain.  Note that much of the record activity on Raydium occurred early this month, primarily driven by the memecoin frenzy, which propelled trading volumes to record highs, fueling significant interest in the RAY token.

The % short float for CleanSpark is at 31% of their shares outstanding. Dilution, combined with this excessive shorting, has spooked retail investors. A major catalyst for CleanSpark will be their guidance for Q4 earnings as they have been HODLing a significant number of bitcoins where the appreciation in price will eventually show. CleanSpark is one of the few miners that has scale and is also very cost-efficient, thus making it the best mining investment opportunity on the market. I have a Strong Buy rating for CleanSpark with an expected price target of $45 by Q3 2025 earnings, based on my modelling for future revenue and earnings. CleanSpark (CLSK) is one of the many bitcoin miners that should have seen major appreciation in its stock value as Bitcoin almost reached a new high of $100,000. The stock price is up nearly 40% year to date; however, it has been tepid recently with the price being down by around 15% over the last six months whilst bitcoin experienced a steep rise. It is one of the most efficient miners and has been holding all of its bitcoin to maximize shareholder value. My analysis below will explain the macro cycle for bitcoin; why CleanSpark is lagging; and how much upside there is to the stock price over the coming quarters. This will be based on the future expected earnings, which I have forecasted based on some reasonable assumptions. The macro cycle The main influencer of the value of mining companies holding Bitcoin, including CleanSpark is the future-expected price of bitcoin. Bitcoin correlates very closely with global liquidity or the money supply (M2) and has been on a growing trend since the start of 2023. The chart below shows the % change in price of bitcoin against the % change in M2, which shows this strong relationship between the two over the last decade. Bitcoin Is Data This current liquidity cycle is only at the mid-cycle stage, and there is plenty of upside left going into 2025. The peak price of bitcoin this cycle is anyone’s guess, although the CEO of CleanSpark predicted a peak under $200,000 towards the end of 2025. Based on the chart, there is plenty of upside left if you consider the previous cycle tops. It is also likely that global liquidity will continue to improve as the fed eases monetary policy and the PBOC are being advised to inject stronger stimulus to achieve their economic growth targets. From a technical perspective, the trend for bitcoin is up as the 50 MA (blue line) exceeded the 200 MA (orange line) in late October, which signifies a ‘golden cross’. The golden cross is a bullish chart pattern that shows a positive longer-term trend of an asset. There may be mild corrections as it appreciates, but the overall trend will likely continue to go up, which will be reflected in CleanSpark’s balance sheet. Yahoo finance Why CleanSpark is lagging The key question is why the price of CleanSpark is lagging when the price of Bitcoin has been appreciating and whilst the indicators for Bitcoin appear to be on a positive trend. I think there are two reasons for this. The first is that the appreciation in the price of bitcoin will not show up in the balance sheet for the Q4 earnings. The fair value accounting of bitcoin miners is such that the upcoming reporting quarter will assess the price difference of bitcoin at the end of September against the end of June, where the price change has been flat. This is all whilst the cost of mining has appreciated due to the increase in the network hashrate or difficulty. This results in a poor outlook for miners with the HODL value, and revenue not seeing appreciation whilst the costs of mining have. The appreciation of bitcoin will only show up in the balance sheet for the Q1 2025 earnings, which will track the price change at the end of December against the end of September. I believe the market makers are taking advantage of the poor sentiment this quarter. The second reason is the market manipulation by institutions who have been shorting CleanSpark based on its current outlook. Calculated by Author using information from MarketBeat and CleanSpark investor relations The chart shows that the short interest for CleanSpark has increased significantly over the past quarter to 22%, as reported by NASDAQ. Fintel shows that figure at 31% once you include the off-exchange short volume, which is primarily held by institutional investors. It almost seems counterintuitive that institutions are shorting CleanSpark at a time when the price of bitcoin continues to appreciate. This has resulted in retail investors foregoing CleanSpark for other crypto investment plays. However, that is unlikely to unfold once the appreciation of bitcoin shows up in the balance sheet of CleanSpark resulting in record earnings and a potential short squeeze in the near term. The other most common argument for why CleanSpark is down is the rate of dilution, but I will explain below in the valuation section why dilution is necessary and is actually beneficial for shareholders. How CleanSpark compares to other miners Before I discuss the valuation, I think it would be useful to compare how CleanSpark performs against other miners. The two most important factors to assess are scale and the efficiency of their operations. Below I’ve included a few key metrics that I track to compare miners, which shows that CleanSpark is one of the few miners that can achieve efficiency at scale. The first metric I track is the scale of mining operations and the size of bitcoin holdings (the HODL). It is only the miners that hold large amounts of bitcoins that will see significant improvement in their balance sheet as the price of bitcoin continues to appreciate. I will explain the significance of this in the valuation section. Compass Mining and Power Mining Analysis CleanSpark is the fourth-largest miner in terms of its holding for Bitcoin as of October 2024, which will only continue to improve as they improve their hashrate. TheMinerMag The second chart shows the estimated cost incurred by a mining company to operate and maintain 1 petahash per second (PH/s) of computing power. This, for example, would include hardware, electricity, overheads, and maintenance costs, but excludes depreciation of assets and stock-based compensation. The metric shows how cost-efficient a miner is because as the difficulty increases, companies need more PH/s to mine a single bitcoin. CleanSpark ranks very well across this metric to its peers, with a very low $/PH/s. One of the reasons for this is because they have updated their fleets and have purchased several S21 Bitmain miners to improve fleet efficiency, but are also able to leverage fixed costs across their mining rigs with their economies of scale. Compass Mining and Power Mining Analysis Another reason CleanSpark is cost-efficient is due to how reliable their infrastructure is. The chart above measures utilization, which is how long the mining equipment is consistently active. CleanSpark is the second most efficient miner in October, which means they are able to mine more coins a month and have less downtime due to equipment failure or maintenance. This is a sign of a very well-run company. Valuation I have a Strong Buy rating on CleanSpark based on its top-line growth in earnings over the next 9 months. My base case price target for the stock is $45, which represents roughly a 3x from where the stock price sits today. The range for the stock price is large, which is primarily influenced by the future expected price of bitcoin. My analysis forecasts net profit/losses for the upcoming earnings - Q4 2024 (covering July to September) to Q3 2025 (April to June) depending on the prevailing price of bitcoin and then the P/E multiple ratio for CleanSpark. I’ll start by explaining the key inputs and assumptions before explaining in detail how I calculated the earnings for each quarter. Calculated by Author using own assumptions and information in CleanSpark investor relations. The number of shares outstanding was at 228 million at the end of Q2 2024 and currently sits at 253 million. My analysis assumes that dilution increases at a rate of 11% per quarter, based on the dilution rate of previous quarters. This could be higher or lower depending on how aggressively management pursues acquisitions and increases the hashrate. The expected price of bitcoin is anyone’s guess, but I’ve chosen a relatively flat rate for the bear case which assumes that the bitcoin price is near peaking, and a target of $150k for the base, and $225k for the bull. These plug-in values could be different, but I thought they were reasonable estimates. For the bear case, some may expect a sharp depreciation in the price of bitcoin, but I think this is very unlikely due to the positive trend I explained earlier. My chosen PE multiple is between 10 and 30 based on what a reasonable multiple would be for a mining company that is operating profitably. The PE multiple affects the target stock price, but not as much as the price of bitcoin. The improvements in fleet efficiency is based on how much additional hashrate is acquired between each quarter and assuming CleanSpark will only add the most efficient equipment such as S21 XP which operates at 13J/THs . CleanSpark’s projected hashrate improvements is based on their investor relations, where they suggested they could achieve 37 EH/s by the year-end and are targeting 50 EH/s by the end of next year. My analysis assumes the ramp is steady and gets to 43 EH/s by June 2025 with an average of 41 EH/s for Q3 2025 earnings. The network hashrate or bitcoin difficulty is not straightforward to predict. My model assumes that network hashrate grows at a rate of 7% per month or 23% per quarter. This is based on the increase in recent months whilst bitcoin has appreciated. The % increase for Q4 is 18% as it takes the average of October, November (which are already known) and assuming a higher hashrate of 790 EH/s in December. The bitcoin mined is calculated using the average hashrate divided by the network hashrate against the total available coins mined a day, and assuming a utilization of around 98%. My analysis is conservative for the network hashrate estimate, as CleanSpark’s hashrate doesn’t increase at the same rate, resulting in fewer coins mined in the Q2 and Q3 2025 earnings period. The cost to mine only covers the mining cost and excludes all other costs, including overheads and depreciation. This is calculated using an extrapolation of the cost to mine in CleanSpark's Q1 investor presentation . My analysis extrapolates the cost to mine for each month and quarter using the table below, and using my input values for network hashrate and fleet efficiency. CleanSpark Investor relations So now, with the key assumptions aside, I will explain how I derived net earnings for each quarter for the base case. Calculated by Author using own assumptions and information in CleanSpark investor relations. The table shows the forecasted revenue and expenses for each quarter. I included Q3 2024 earnings to help demonstrate how I calculated future quarters. The analysis shows significantly higher profits from the Q1 2025 earnings period. The bitcoin mining revenue is calculated by multiplying the bitcoin mined each quarter by the average price of bitcoin across the quarter. For example, for the Q4 2024 earnings, this would be 1465 x $61k = $89 million. Likewise, the cost of revenue can be calculated by multiplying 1465 x $33k = $54 million. The price increase in bitcoin results in higher revenue each quarter. For ‘other income,’ I extrapolated the interest income and expense but removed the unrealized gain or losses on derivative security incurred in Q3 2024. For 'other costs' which include professional fees, payroll expenses, and general admin expenses, I extrapolated an increase in payroll expenses and general admin expenses based on previous quarter-over-quarter increases. I assumed a flat rate for professional fees and excluded the one-off impairment expense reported in the 2024 Q3 earnings for writing off old inefficient mining equipment. Calculating the fair value gain/loss of bitcoin requires multiplying the value of bitcoin at the end of the quarter by the HODL and subtracting the mining revenue and the value of the HODL in the previous quarter. For Q4 2024, the sum is (8049 x $63k) – $89 million - $104 million = $8 million. It is important to depict that the fair value gain/loss is recorded as an expense, but this is a negative expense in quarters where the value of the HODL has appreciated. This results in overall costs being negative for CleanSpark in Q1 2025 onwards. Furthermore, the rate of appreciation in the HODL far outweighs the rate of increase in dilution. My analysis suggests that the value of the HODL will increase by around 250%, which will far outpace dilution. This means that the management's decision to equity finance expansions over selling the HODL will result in significantly more value to shareholders. Lastly, the depreciation of assets was kept flat, although it may increase with more infrastructure and rigs coming online. The income tax was calculated based on expected earnings in each quarter. Conclusion CleanSpark offers a great opportunity within the bitcoin mining sector for the patient investor. Whilst the stock price has underperformed in the short term, primarily due to dilution, shorting, and the timing of bitcoin's fair value accounting, this correction is only temporary. As global liquidity increases and the price of bitcoin continues its upward trend, CleanSpark's balance sheet is expected to reflect substantial appreciation, particularly from the Q1 2025 earnings. This alongside its competitive advantages in cost efficiency suggests a robust earnings growth and potential short squeeze in the near term.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4740847-cleanspark-why-the-shorts-have-got-it-wrong?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/36943202.jpeg

A recent report by Glassnode analyzes the cohorts driving the sell-side pressure during this ongoing bull run. Majority Of Sell-Side Pressure Coming From New Market Entrants According to Glassnode’s report titled “The Week Onchain,” while some long-term Bitcoin holders realize substantial profits – amounting to over $2 billion in a single day – not all are willing to part with their holdings. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Closes Above Bull Channel, Crypto Analyst Reveals What’s Next The report highlights that the Long-Term Holder (LTH) cohort is capitalizing on the inflow of liquidity and strong demand to sell BTC near all-time high (ATH) price levels. Glassnode notes: Since the peak in LTH supply set in September, this cohort has now distributed a non-trivial 507k BTC. This is a sizeable volume; however, it is smaller in scale relative to the 934k BTC spent during the rally into the March 2024 ATH. The report breaks the LTH cohort into sub-cohorts based on realized profit metrics to understand the sell-side dynamics better. It reveals that holders who acquired BTC 6 months to 1 year ago contribute the most to sell-side pressure, realizing $12.6 billion in profits, accounting for 35.3% of all realized gains. Other sub-cohorts have realized comparatively smaller profits, including $7.2 billion by those holding BTC for 1 to 2 years, $4.8 billion by those with 2 to 3 years of holdings, $6.3 billion by 3 to 5-year holders, and $4.8 billion by investors holding for more than 5 years. The report adds: The dominance of coins aged 6m-1y highlights that the majority of spending has originated from coins acquired relatively recently, highlighting that more tenured investors are remaining measured and potentially waiting patiently for higher prices. This pattern suggests that heightened profit-taking among holders in the 6-month to 1-year range indicates the cohort is dominated by newer investors, many of whom likely entered the market following the launch of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF). Their strategy appears to involve short-term gains, riding the wave of the current market surge.

Will it keep rallying, or are there better opportunities on the market? Traders eye Binance listing Everyone is talking about a Binance listing for Just a chill guy. It makes sense; it’s the hottest meme coin of the week, and Binance has listed other new meme coins like Peanut the Squirrel and ACT I: The AI Prophecy. It’s not just pure speculation driving the rumors. On-chain sleuths are closely watching for links between the exchange and the token, with multiple people claiming to have spotted Binance wallets accumulating CHILLGUY. https://twitter.com/ToshimaTaosonak/status/1860828870699594235 Binance is the largest crypto exchange by 24-hour trading volume. Should it list Just a chill guy, this would open the token to a vast pool of investors, which could help its price soar hihger. For reference, Peanut the Squirrel exploded over 5x following its Binance listing, hitting a $2 billion market cap. CHILLGUY defies market downturn What’s impressive about CHILLGUY’s performance is its rallying while other cryptos tumble. Today, the top five meme coins are all in red, as are the market-leading cryptos, Bitcoin and Ethereum. CHILLGUY’s strength in this period suggests significant demand, which could allow a stronger rally as the broader market recovers. $CHILLGUY one of the very few recent memes holding near it's ATHs A good signal of strength and indicates it should outperform in the next meme runs should it staysconstructive here by not dipping below it's previous low You'd also want to see high volume on any green candles… pic.twitter.com/XkWaxoGfkh — Eddie (@eddietradezz) November 26, 2024 As to how far it can go, numerous analysts are pointing to a $1 billion market cap target. $CHILLGUY getting ready to move towards 1 Billion The breakout gonna be nasty lfg pic.twitter.com/dfDMNiXfxg — $Bossman (@0xBossman) November 26, 2024 Given CHILLGUY’s relative strength amidst the market selloff, this seems attainable. Should it secure the Binance listing as hoped, it may even mimic Peanut the Squirrel’s performance and reach a $2 billion valuation. That would give a token price of around $2. Cryptos looking to outperform CHILLGUY Just a chill guy is not the only meme coin with momentum today. Traders are also buying lower market cap alternatives hoping to outperform CHILLGUY in the next rally. One of these alternatives is Flockerz , a viral bird-themed meme coin that is all about decentralization. The project is currently in its presale phase, allowing investors to buy in at the lowest price. Analysts believe this could be another meme coin that could provide huge returns, with ClayBro even saying it could “be a millionaire maker.” The project stands out from other meme coins with a Vote-to-Earn decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). This allows FLOCK holders to vote on decisions relating to the project’s future and get paid for it. It improves the governance system of most meme coins, which are controlled by centralized teams. Flockerz has raised $3.4 million in its presale so far. The current price is $0.0061504, but this will rise in one day.

The PEPE price has shown strong support, with many holders positioning themselves at key levels that favor upward movement. While there’s optimism about PEPE’s price increase, analysts are also mindful of rising selling pressure, which could put a lid on the coin’s growth.

36941535,https://coinpaper.com/6284/vancouver-mayor-ken-sim-proposes-bitcoin-as-a-reserve-asset,1732775098,Vancouver Mayor Ken Sim Proposes Bitcoin as a Reserve Asset,"Sim's proposal aligns with the growing global interest in Bitcoin as a reserve asset. This is evident in the aggressive BTC acquisition strategies of companies like MARA Holdings and MicroStrategy. Meanwhile, the growing institutional adoption is boosted even more by the launch of options on Bitcoin ETFs on major U.S. exchanges. Analysts also predict Bitcoin’s price could surge in 2025, fueled by a weakening U.S. dollar, increased liquidity, and growing adoption metrics. Vancouver Explores Adding Bitcoin to City Balance Sheet Ken Sim, the mayor of Vancouver since 2022, announced plans to explore adding Bitcoin (BTC) to the Canadian city’s balance sheet as part of its strategy to diversify its financial resources. During a Vancouver city council meeting on Nov. 26, Sim submitted a notice of motion titled “Preserving the city’s purchasing power through diversification of financial resources: Becoming a Bitcoin-friendly city.” The motion is set to be introduced on Dec. 11, but is not available on the city government’s website yet. Mayor Ken Sim Bitcoin advocate and author Jeff Booth revealed in a Nov. 26 X Spaces discussion that the mayor’s proposal aims to establish Bitcoin as a reserve asset for the city. The proposal also aligns with ongoing debates in the United States, where lawmakers in Pennsylvania and the U.S. Senate discussed plans to adopt Bitcoin as a reserve asset after the 2024 elections. Mayor Sim’s engagement with crypto predates his time in office. During his mayoral campaign, Sim’s political party, A Better City, accepted cryptocurrency donations . While in office, Sim made limited public remarks on Bitcoin or broader crypto adoption. However, a recent Global News interview from Nov. 25 revealed a copy of The Bitcoin Standard by Saifedean Ammous in the mayor’s office, which is a book that is widely read and referred to by crypto enthusiasts to advocate for Bitcoin adoption. Whether Sim’s motion will gain enough support in the Vancouver City Council remains to be seen. Sim claimed to have fulfilled more than 70% of the 94 campaign promises he made since taking office, and may now make it a priority to position Vancouver as a leader in embracing crypto. MARA Boosts Bitcoin Holdings MARA Holdings is also making sure to get its piece of the Bitcoin pie. The mining company announced on Nov. 27 that it acquired 6,474 Bitcoin by using proceeds from its recent $1 billion convertible note offering . The acquisition included an initial purchase of 5,771 BTC at an average price of $95,395 per coin, which was then followed by an additional 703 BTC. MARA’s year-to-date per-share yield on its Bitcoin holdings stands at 36.7%, and the company’s treasury now holds about 34,797 BTC that is valued at $3.3 billion. As part of its financial strategy, MARA also repurchased a portion of its 2026 notes for $200 million and plans to use the remaining $160 million from the convertible debt raise to buy even more Bitcoin during price dips. This approach is very similar to the strategy pioneered by MicroStrategy, which used corporate debt to build one of the largest Bitcoin treasuries among publicly traded companies . MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin acquisition strategy has been ongoing since 2020. Its most recent $3 billion senior convertible note issuance at 0% interest forms part of its 21/21 plan to raise $42 billion over three years. Between Nov. 18 and 24, MicroStrategy bought 55,000 BTC at an average price of $97,862 per coin. This brought its total Bitcoin holdings to approximately 386,700 BTC. Despite its ambitious plans, MicroStrategy faced some criticism for relying so heavily on debt to fund Bitcoin acquisitions. Some people argue it is a risky and unsustainable approach. While the company will not face repayment obligations until 2028, a sharp decline in Bitcoin prices could expose it to major financial risks. Due to these investor concerns, MicroStrategy’s stock price dropped by 25% on Nov. 21. Growing Money Supply Fuels Bitcoin’s 2025 Outlook Companies like MicroStrategy will be pleased to hear that analysts predict a Bitcoin bull rally in 2025, fueled by the growing global money supply and a potential decline in the United States dollar. Bitcoin almost reached the $100,000 mark on Nov. 22 before experiencing a correction, and some suggested the crypto could retrace up to 30%. Despite this, the chief crypto analyst at Real Vision, Jamie Coutts , sees the weakening U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) and increased liquidity as setting the stage for a big price surge. Coutts pointed out the historic correlation between Bitcoin prices and the M2 money supply, which turned positive year-over-year in May of 2024 for the first time since late 2023. This shift already prompted a 58% rise in Bitcoin's price as investors increasingly see the crypto as a hedge against inflation. Projections for the global M2 supply suggest it could grow by 18% to exceed $127 trillion in 2025, driven by liquidity injections from the U.S. Federal Reserve. Coutts predicted that Bitcoin could rise to $132,000 or even higher next year, although he warned that cycles are not strictly linear. Donald Trump’s recent victory in the U.S. presidential election is another factor that is expected to boost Bitcoin’s 2025 rally. Analysts from Bitfinex expect increased risk appetite and a much more supportive regulatory environment under the new administration. Additionally, MicroStrategy’s ongoing Bitcoin acquisition strategy could likely provide more upward momentum. Bitcoin’s price action over the past month (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Bitcoin’s adoption metrics also seem rather strong, with daily active addresses approaching one million for the first time since 2019. These combined macroeconomic factors and institutional interest point to a bullish trajectory for the crypto in the coming year. However, a potential breakout in the DXY could still pose a risk to this outlook. MIAX Sapphire Lists Options on Bitcoin ETFs MIAX Sapphire Options Exchange revised its rules to allow the listing of options on three Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), according to a regulatory filing on Nov. 25. The changes allow MIAX Sapphire to list options tied to the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC), and Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB). The exchange is part of Miami International Holdings, and joins Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in offering options on spot Bitcoin ETFs. This happened after a series of regulatory approvals. In September, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) allowed Nasdaq to list options on the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), which made it the first time these products were approved for U.S. trading. In October, the SEC granted similar authorizations to NYSE and Cboe, and in November, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) cleared the final hurdles for listing Bitcoin ETF options. On Nov. 18, which was the first day of trading, options contracts on BlackRock’s IBIT ETF reached almost $2 billion in total exposure. These options allow traders to speculate on Bitcoin prices by buying or selling “call” or “put” contracts at a specified price, with the OCC acting as a safeguard against counterparty risks. The introduction of spot Bitcoin ETF options on regulated U.S. exchanges is a pivotal moment for the crypto market. Investment managers believe these products will accelerate institutional adoption even more and unlock major upside potential for Bitcoin holders. Jeff Park, head of alpha strategies at Bitwise Invest, described the move as a monumental advancement that creates compelling opportunities for investors.

This surge coincides with Bitcoin nearing an all-time high of $100,000, fueled by the presidential election victory of Donald Trump, who positions himself as a pro-crypto leader. However, Bloomberg reports that the uncertainty stemming from the 2021 crypto collapse remains palpable among investors, as many altcoins experienced dramatic price fluctuations during past market cycles. Expert Voices Skepticism On Altcoins Rally Altcoins have shown impressive gains, with tokens like Solana (SOL) reaching new all-time highs, while many others have more than doubled in price since the beginning of the year. Historically, altcoins tend to outperform Bitcoin during market rallies but can also experience sharper declines during downturns due to their higher volatility and lower trading volumes. Related Reading: $15 Trillion Market Cap For Bitcoin? Crypto Firm CEO Predicts Explosive Growth The crypto market has been cautious since major players like FTX and crypto lender Celsius collapsed, which contributed to a significant bear market. Despite this, recent activity indicates a resurgence, with increased trading volumes and price rises among altcoins throughout November. Interestingly, James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, expressed skepticism about a massive altcoin rally, particularly in light of potential regulatory changes, including a proposed national Bitcoin reserve. Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis has introduced the Bitcoin Act, which seeks to allocate funds from the Federal Reserve’s gold reserves to acquire a strategic stockpile of 1 million Bitcoin. Butterfill told Bloomberg that the political implications of such legislation could significantly affect market dynamics, potentially increasing Bitcoin’s dominance over its peers. ETF Approval Hopes Could Boost Crypto Interest Under Trump While Solana stands out as the only major altcoin to surpass its previous highs this year, experts like Nikolay Karpenko from crypto trading firm B2C2 believe this rally could differ from the 2021 experience. The expert highlighted the industry’s maturity over the past few years, which has seen improvements in risk management and the entry of “more strategic” and institutional investors into the crypto space. As altcoins continue to gain traction, data shows that trading volume has become increasingly concentrated among the five most traded altcoins, rising from less than 50% earlier this year to over 60% this month. This shift can be attributed to unique factors affecting individual cryptocurrencies, such as Solana’s rise fueled by excitement over potential exchange-traded fund (ETF) approvals and Dogecoin’s gains related to its payment capabilities and support from figures like Elon Musk and his new position at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Related Reading: XRP Consolidates Below Crucial Resistance – Analyst Sets $1.60 Target The expert noted that the possibility of more altcoins receiving approval for ETFs under Trump’s administration could further enhance institutional interest. However, Butterfill cautioned that the market may begin to differentiate between assets, focusing more on fundamentals rather than riding the wave of speculative trading. Despite the bullish sentiment surrounding altcoins, they still trade at significantly lower prices than Bitcoin, with Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, priced at only about 4% of Bitcoin’s value. After hitting a new record high of $263 during last week’s rally, Solana has since fallen back to the $240 level, echoing the current correction Bitcoin is experiencing after hitting its new all-time high of $99,500. At the time of writing, SOL is up nearly 6% in the 24-hour time frame, while BTC is up 4% in the same period.

But the protocol's creator says there's more to the story than silliness.  “BALD caught us all by surprise. You know, this was before the public launch of Base. It was when it was just open for developers,"" Jesse Pollak said during an interview on the sidelines of Devcon in Bangkok. ""I remember waking up on Saturday morning and being like, what is going on? It was not in our plan, and it happened.”  BALD was a salient reminder before Base’s public launch that the crypto space can be unpredictable, and sometimes, rather than trying to control everything, the stewards of a protocol simply need to lean into the chaos and figure out how to turn unexpected situations into something great, Pollak said.  Something that's not a rugpull, which Bald unfortunately ended up being.  Even though dozens of memecoins have launched on Base in the last year, Pollak wants the protocol to be known for more than that.  Pollak has been on something of a world tour with Base over the last few weeks meeting developers in Africa and Asia, stopping in conferences like Devcon.  During the interview, he emphasized that Base is witnessing significant growth in emerging markets like Southeast Asia, Kenya, and India, where the population wants access to secure economic options like stablecoins.  Indeed, on-chain data shows that Base is quickly catching up to Solana – a much older and more established blockchain – in stablecoin issuance. DeFiLlama data shows Base clocking in at just over $3.5 billion in stablecoin market cap, making it the sixth-highest chain for the dollar-pegged tokens.  Base also has its critics, who argue that its ties to Coinbase lead to an unhealthy amount of centralization in the industry.  The recent one-two punch of delisting Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) while promoting a Base-powered competitor, cbBTC, earned the latter bitcoin analogue the epithet ""central bank bitcoin"" from the CEO of wBTC's custodian. But Pollak dismisses these concerns, pointing to Bald.  ""Bald showed that Base wasn't going to be this place that was fully manicured, curated, controlled, and centralized,"" he said.  Pollak argues that if Bald can happen on Base with such incredible expressiveness that the Base team had no control over, it proves the platform’s openness.  ""I think that was actually a really, really powerful welcoming for the rest of the ecosystem to embrace Base as an open economy where they could participate,"" he continued.  Base, a layer-2, is built to lean into the decentralization of Ethereum, the protocol that it's built upon, Pollak pointed out.  “Base is built on open source, so that anyone, anywhere can fork the code, know what’s running, and see that it’s actually doing the thing they wanted to,” he said, pointing to the recent launch of fault proofs on Base.  These proofs allow any of Base's 763,036 active addresses (according to DeFiLlama data) to validate and challenge transactions, which Pollak says significantly increases decentralization by removing reliance on centralized entities.  Centralized entities, including Coinbase, which, technically, Base could outlive.  “There are seamless ways to get in and out of Base, so even if Coinbase completely disappeared, people would still be able to transact,"" Pollak said.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/11/28/memecoins-show-coinbases-base-blockchain-isnt-so-centralized-founder-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/004752fbe4f3f6961957f2a6a7e6d90e719fb01d-2006x1129.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

November 2024 has been nothing short of explosive for both projects. Solana’s decentralised exchange (DEX) volumes hit a record-breaking $109 billion, making Ethereum’s numbers seem quaint by comparison. At the same time, Cronos achieved a 50% rally, fuelled by its ambitious roadmap and a strategic partnership with Google Cloud. While these giants are shaking up the scene, there’s another gem catching attention— Qubetics ($TICS). If you’ve ever felt the frustration of siloed networks or clunky systems, Qubetics is the answer. The token ($TICS) is already solving problems that others only promise to address. With interoperability and groundbreaking use cases, Qubetics could be the next big thing in crypto. So, let’s dig deeper into why $TICS, SOL, and CRO are among the best cryptos to buy now. Qubetics ($TICS): Making a remarkable entry with Interoperability Picture you’re a business owner who needs to send payments across different blockchains. Right now, you’d face endless headaches juggling wallets and converting tokens. That’s where Qubetics shines. As the world’s first Web3 aggregator, it doesn’t just link blockchains—it makes them play nice together. Interoperability with Qubetics is like giving your smartphone the ability to sync seamlessly with any device, app, or ecosystem. With Qubetics, integrating Ethereum payments alongside Solana-based NFTs isn’t a dream—it’s a simple API call. Imagine the possibilities for professionals managing digital assets or individuals sending crypto across borders. Qubetics eliminates the friction, making cross-chain interactions smoother than a TikTok scroll. Right now, Qubetics is in its tenth presale stage, and the momentum is wild. Over 231 million tokens have been sold, pulling in a hefty $3.4 million. At $0.25 by the presale’s end, investors are looking at an 871% ROI. After the presale? To put that into perspective, a $1 investment today could turn into $582.13. Solana (SOL): The Speed Demon Dominating DEX Volumes Solana’s reputation for lightning-fast transactions isn’t news, but its recent achievements are rewriting crypto history. In November alone, Solana’s DEX platforms clocked $109 billion in total transaction volumes. That’s a 109% jump from October and double Ethereum’s numbers. On November 18, Solana hit a jaw-dropping daily record of $7.14 billion, leaving analysts wondering: Is Ethereum’s dominance slipping for good? A big part of this surge is the memecoin mania. Platforms like Pump.fun and Raydium have seen revenues of $71.5 million and $182 million, respectively, all thanks to the growing buzz around meme tokens. But let’s not ignore Solana’s backbone—low transaction costs and unparalleled speed, which make it a darling for developers and traders alike. Solana’s native token, SOL, hasn’t been a slouch either. Its price soared by 61.5% in November, peaking at $263. Technical charts suggest this is just the start. With a breakout from a rounded bottom chart pattern, SOL could easily reach $300 in the short term. Sure, its RSI is hovering at an overheated 70, hinting at a possible pullback to $200. But for long-term holders, the horizon looks bright. Cronos (CRO): Riding the Wave of Big Partnerships and Bigger Plans Cronos, the native token of Crypto.com’s ecosystem, has been quietly but steadily building its empire. Last week, it wasn’t so quiet. CRO exploded by 50%, reaching over $0.11 for the first time since June. What’s behind this surge? Two words: ambition and partnerships. Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek didn’t just share a vision—he dropped a roadmap during the US election week that sent investors into a frenzy. From adding stock trading and banking features to launching a Bitcoin rewards program, the roadmap is packed with innovation. The upcoming “Level Up” rewards program alone could revolutionise how users interact with the platform. Add AI trading tools, custodial solutions for institutional clients, and a proprietary stablecoin, and you’ve got a recipe for long-term growth. CRO’s price surged to $0.095 following the roadmap announcement and has only gained momentum since. Analysts see this as a stepping stone, with predictions suggesting significant upside potential. If you’re hunting for the best cryptos to buy now, don’t overlook Cronos—it’s more than just hype. Your Move Crypto’s future is never guaranteed, but projects like Qubetics, Solana, and Cronos are rewriting the rules. Whether it’s Qubetics tackling interoperability, Solana dominating DEX volumes, or Cronos expanding through innovation, each offers a unique value proposition. The Qubetics presale is already making waves, and with its current $0.025 pricing, it’s an opportunity you don’t want to miss. SOL and CRO have proven they’re here for the long haul, and their recent performance only adds to the case. So, what’s your move? Dive into Qubetics, grab some SOL, or ride the wave with CRO. One thing’s for sure: these are the best cryptos to buy now. But don’t wait—opportunities like this don’t last forever. Take action today and secure your slice of the crypto revolution.

36939599,https://coinpaper.com/6285/november-sets-yearly-high-for-stablecoin-trading-with-77-surge,1732771914,November Sets Yearly High for Stablecoin Trading with 77% Surge,"Stablecoins are steadily gaining traction as a crucial component of the digital asset ecosystem, showcasing significant growth in trading volumes and market capitalization. However, their broader adoption, particularly in global e-commerce, remains limited due to regulatory uncertainties and an over-reliance on USD-pegged assets. Recent reports highlight both the promise and challenges of stablecoins, emphasizing their transformative potential in digital payments while shedding light on the barriers preventing their widespread use in traditional commerce and international transactions. November Stablecoin Trading Surges Amid Growing Institutional Confidence in Digital Assets November witnessed a remarkable resurgence in the stablecoin market, fueled by increasing institutional confidence and a broader positive sentiment in the digital assets sector. According to a report released by CCData on Nov. 27, trading volume for stablecoins skyrocketed by 77.5%, reaching an impressive $1.81 trillion as of Nov. 25. This puts monthly trading activity on centralized exchanges on track to achieve its highest level of 2024. In a continuation of a 14-month growth streak, the total stablecoin market capitalization rose by 9.94% in November, climbing to $190 billion. This milestone surpasses the previous all-time high of $188 billion recorded in April 2022, just before the collapse of TerraUSD (UST), an algorithmic stablecoin that sent shockwaves through the market. Despite this significant recovery, the market dominance of stablecoins slipped to 5.54% from 7.22% in October following a shift in investor focus toward Bitcoin and altcoins. Tether’s USDt remains the leader in the stablecoin market, strengthening its position with a 10.5% growth in market capitalization to $133 billion. This places USDt as the dominant player, accounting for 69.9% of the total stablecoin market. Circle’s USD Coin (USDC) also posted impressive gains, expanding its market capitalization by 12.1% to reach $38.9 billion, which is its highest level since February 2023. Ethena Labs’ USDe stablecoin emerged as one of the standout performers in November, with its market capitalization soaring by 42.2% to $3.86 billion. The surge in demand for USDe is largely attributed to heightened interest in the Ethena ecosystem, following a proposal to activate revenue sharing for Ethena (ENA) token holders. Since its launch in February 2024, USDe has maintained strong appeal, although its annual percentage yield (APY) has declined from a high of 55.9% in March to 21.2% in November, according to CCData. While some stablecoins recorded significant growth, others faced declines. First Digital USD (FDUSD) and Sky Dollar (USDS)—formerly Dai (DAI)—experienced notable contractions in market capitalization. FDUSD saw a 14.9% drop to $1.90 billion, while USDS fell by 8.34% to $950 million. Diversification Beyond Stablecoins The report also notes a broader trend of diversification in the cryptocurrency market. While stablecoins remain a crucial component of the digital asset landscape, investors have increasingly allocated capital to Bitcoin (BTC) and other altcoins. This trend has contributed to the decline in stablecoin market dominance despite the overall growth in capitalization. The sharp rise in stablecoin trading volume and market capitalization comes amid a growing institutional reliance on these digital assets as a stable medium for transactions, trading, and risk management. Tether and Circle’s continued dominance reflects their ability to maintain trust and utility in a rapidly evolving market, while the rise of new entrants like USDe showcases the potential for innovation and ecosystem-driven growth in the sector. As the cryptocurrency market enters 2025, stablecoins are poised to remain a pivotal element of the industry, bridging the gap between traditional finance and decentralized systems. However, the challenges faced by some stablecoins indicate that maintaining competitive advantages and user trust will be critical for sustained success. Stablecoins’ Potential in E-Commerce Hindered by Limited Adoption and Non-USD Scarcity Stablecoins, known for their cost efficiency, transparency, and speed, are making waves in the cryptocurrency space but still account for a minuscule share of global online commerce transactions. A joint report by strategy consultancy Quinlan & Associates and blockchain developer IDA, published on Nov. 27, places the spotlight on the challenges and untapped potential of stablecoins in e-commerce and beyond. Cryptocurrencies, including stablecoins, represent just 0.2% of the global e-commerce transaction value, the report reveals. While their programmability and efficiency make them an attractive alternative to traditional payment systems, stablecoin adoption remains largely confined to the Web3 ecosystem. “Paired with blockchain-enabled favourable features such as programmability, stablecoins can offer cost efficiency, enhanced transparency, 24/7 availability, and faster processing that traditional financial systems simply can’t match,” Lawrence Chu, IDA’s co-founder and CEO, said in a statement. The report identifies regulatory uncertainty as the leading hurdle to stablecoin adoption. Approximately 81% of merchants cited regulatory ambiguity as the primary reason for hesitating to accept digital assets as a mainstream payment option. Moreover, the scarcity of stablecoins pegged to currencies other than the United States dollar poses a significant challenge. While the USD dominates international finance, it is not the official or secondary currency in 83% of countries worldwide. Additionally, roughly 40% of global international payments are conducted in non-USD currencies, creating a pressing need for stablecoins tied to other currencies. Stablecoins collectively account for $200 billion in market capitalization, nearly all of which is concentrated in USD-pegged assets, according to CoinMarketCap. Tether’s USDt (USDT) and USD Coin ( USDC ) dominate the space with market caps of $130 billion and $40 billion, respectively. The over-reliance on USD-pegged stablecoins not only limits the potential for international adoption but also raises questions about economic sovereignty for countries outside the dollar system. In response to the lack of non-USD stablecoins, IDA announced plans to launch a stablecoin pegged to the Hong Kong dollar. This new digital asset aims to facilitate payments between Hong Kong and global markets, offering a potential model for other non-USD stablecoins. Stablecoins have also become a significant player in the financial ecosystem, particularly through their backing with short-term US government securities like Treasury bills. Minutes from a US Department of Treasury meeting, released on Oct. 29, noted that stablecoin growth has modestly increased demand for short-dated Treasury securities. Regulatory Progress on the Horizon Former US Senator Pat Toomey said on Nov. 20 that lawmakers are likely to prioritize stablecoin regulation starting in 2025. Key questions surrounding reserve requirements, insurance on bank deposits, and the jurisdiction of regulatory bodies remain unresolved. The upcoming congressional term will also consider pivotal legislation, such as Senator Bill Hagerty’s Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act, which seeks to provide a clear framework for stablecoin issuers and users. While stablecoins have made significant strides, their role in global e-commerce and financial systems is still nascent. Addressing regulatory uncertainties and diversifying the currency base of stablecoins are critical steps for unlocking their full potential. As new stablecoin projects like the Hong Kong dollar-pegged asset emerge and regulatory clarity improves, stablecoins could move beyond their Web3 niche and become a transformative force in the global financial landscape.",POSITIVE,ENA,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | ENA,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6285/november-sets-yearly-high-for-stablecoin-trading-with-77-surge,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

36939544,https://square.htx.com/?p=41697,1732771800,How to Seize Bull Market Opportunities? HTX’s New Crypto Loans Product Offers the Answer,"Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S. presidential election earlier this November has ushered in a long-awaited bull market for the crypto industry, driving Bitcoin to new all-time highs. Recently, as Trump nominated several crypto-friendly figures to his cabinet and SEC Chair Gary Gensler resigned, the crypto community has become increasingly optimistic about the industry’s long-term development. Many prominent crypto experts remain bullish about the upcoming 2025. For instance, Arthur Hayes has predicted that Bitcoin could reach $250,000 by the end of next year. The arrival of the bull market is also evident in altcoins’ explosive growth. For a long time time, altcoins were sluggish, with most performing significantly worse than Bitcoin. However, they’ve recently caught up and even surpassed Bitcoin’s gains. According to data from Quantify Crypto, as of November 26, over 180 out of the top 200 cryptocurrencies by market cap, excluding stablecoins, saw price hikes over the past month, with more than 60 surging by at least 50%. The overall robust performance signals a true bull market, which has also brought investors opportunities to make their moves. This year, Bitcoin has become increasingly accepted in mainstream markets, and its role as a long-term store of value and a tool to hedge against inflation has been gradually recognized. As a result, many people, especially high-net-worth individuals, have reached a consensus that Bitcoin is worth holding for the long term. Meanwhile, crypto KOL Phyrex analyzed on-chain data and found that the number of Bitcoins held by high-net-worth investors (those with a holding of at least 10 Bitcoins) has been rising sharply in Bitcoin’s recent rally. Moreover, if Trump fulfills his campaign promise to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve, Bitcoin’s status as a safe-haven asset will be further enhanced. At the same time, high-quality altcoins remain an excellent choice for investors seeking higher returns. Recently, apart from the remarkable wealth stories seen in new sectors such as AI meme coins, many existing projects have performed impressively, such as DOGE, the OG of the meme coin world, and established cryptos like XRP and LTC, with their 7-day gains higher than Bitcoin. So, how should investors choose between Bitcoin’s long-term advantages and altcoins’ short-term returns? In response, cryptocurrency exchange HTX has announced the launch of its highly-anticipated Flexible Crypto Loans in early December, offering a way for investors to achieve both goals. Through HTX’s Crypto Loans, users can retain their Bitcoin or other long-term holdings while borrowing funds at market-based dynamic interest rates for investment, thereby improving capital efficiency and further maximizing returns. Besides USDT, the product also supports borrowing Bitcoin and Ethereum, giving users a broader range of options. Lending services have long been part of the crypto industry, with numerous centralized and decentralized solutions available. To stand out in the competition, HTX has packed its new product with multiple advantages. First, Flexible Crypto Loans offer high LTVs and charge no fees, thus making it more accessible and allowing users to borrow and repay anytime flexibly based on their needs. Second, the product does not have a loanable limit, catering to the loan needs of high-net-worth clients. At the same time, the dynamic interest rate mechanism keeps the product’s interest rate consistently at a competitive level within the industry. In short, users of HTX’s Crypto Loans can borrow more funds with lower costs and greater flexibility. In appreciation for its users’ long-term support, HTX has also offered an early-bird benefit for users who reserve their borrowing quota. Users who fill out and submit the HTX Crypto Loans Reservation Form and secure their USDT borrowing quota can enjoy a 10% discount on loan interest rate in December after the Flexible Crypto Loans is officially launched. As of now, more than half of the 50 million USDT quota has been reserved. Investors with loan needs must act quickly to claim more benefits. In fact, the advantages of HTX’s Flexible Crypto Loans lie not only in the product itself but also in the HTX platform as a whole. As one of the most security-focused exchanges in the industry, HTX ensures the security of all user funds, including collateral, through robust safety and transparency measures. At the same time, HTX offers diverse services to meet its users’ varying investment needs. For example, the asset listing guided by Global Advisor of HTX Justin Sun has extensive experience in identifying high-quality newly-listed cryptos. Through its recent Crypto Gem Hunt , HTX has listed several cryptos with gains of over 500% in the past month. Another example is its groundbreaking SmartEarn , which offers up to 6% APY on USDT assets in users’ Futures accounts, thus enhancing both trading experience and returns for futures traders. In addition, HTX is highly attuned to market trends and frequently organizes themed events for high-quality cryptos. The ongoing DOGE Frenzy Lucky Draw is a typical example. Participants who trade during the event have a chance to win extra rewards. Therefore, users can handle borrowing, investment, and repayment on HTX alone, which has streamlined the process while creating additional earnings opportunities. As 2024 draws to an end, HTX is delivering users with New Year gifts through continuous product optimization and innovation. If this momentum continues, this bull market may mark the beginning of HTX’s takeoff. The post How to Seize Bull Market Opportunities?

BTC added 3.3% in the past 24 hours, data shows, ahead of a Thanksgiving weekend that has historically recorded sudden price dumps. Strength in BTC buoyed major tokens, with ether (ETH) outperforming with a 7% surge, XRP and BNB Chain rising 6%, and dogecoin (DOGE) adding more than 5%.  A CoinDesk analysis on Wednesday pointed out rising activity on ETH-linked futures and on-chain movements, indicative of traders expecting volatility to the update on the second-largest crypto asset.  Data shows a bump in revenue, fees, new wallets and on-chain volumes on Ethereum, with the past month showing elevated levels of activity compared to the period from May to September. Meanwhile, cumulative open interest in perpetual and standard futures contracts has surged to a record 6.32 million ETH, worth over $27 billion — all signs that support higher ETH prices ahead.  Elsewhere, DeFi tokens aave (AAVE) and uniswap (UNI) surged 9%, and memecoins pepe (PEPE) and mog (MOG) jumped more than 8% on their tendency to act as ether beta bets, as a CoinDesk analysis noted in May.  Traders at QCP Capital said in a Thursday broadcast that money flows are shifting to ETH, with broader equity markets supporting growth in risky asset classes.  “The market is shifting flows to ETH, as evidenced by a 13% surge in the ETH/BTC pair to 0.0366 from its post-election low of 0.0318,” QCP said. “ETH even outperformed the broader CoinDesk 20 Index, which rose just 0.5%.”  “Wall Street achieved record highs after President-elect Trump nominated Scott Bessent as Treasury Secretary, lifting market sentiment. Bessent’s market-friendly approach and potential willingness to moderate Trump’s tariff policies fueled optimism, driving a broad rally across markets, with risky assets leading the charge,” QCP added.  Bessent runs Key Square Group, a macro investing firm. He worked for prominent investor George Soros three decades ago and is considered to be ""one of the driving forces"" behind Soros Fund Management's famous bet — that netted a more than $1 billion profit — that the British pound would collapse.

Analysts suggest this price marks a critical juncture that could significantly influence Dogecoin’s trajectory in the coming days. Related Reading: Dogecoin (DOGE) Gearing Up: Can It Overcome Resistance and Climb? Dogecoin Hit Key Resistance Point The recent rally has garnered significant attention from analysts. Renowned crypto analyst Ali recently shared his technical cryptocurrency analysis via his X account. In the post, the analyst marked out a descending channel on DOGE’s price chart. According to Ali, Dogecoin is currently testing a critical resistance level. He stated that a “sustained” break above the $0.40 price mark could increase the price to $0.43 levels. However, should DOGE fail to breach the $0.40 level, the asset is prone to face another notable dip that would drop its price to $0.36 or even $0.34. #Dogecoin $DOGE is at a very critical resistance point. A sustained break above $0.40 will send it to $0.43, but failing to clear the $0.40 resistance will trigger another dip to $0.36 or even $0.34! pic.twitter.com/fTqpftq3tS — Ali (@ali_charts) November 27, 2024 Key Developments Strengthen DOGE’s Bullish Position Beyond its price movements, Dogecoin has recently benefited from several positive developments that have reinforced investor confidence. One notable instance is the establishment of a new government agency named the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in the United States. This acronym is the same as the ticker for Dogecoin.

This launch expands Valour’s suite of digital asset products, offering investors exposure to Dogecoin, which currently holds a market capitalization of approximately $59.5 billion, ranking it as the 7th largest digital asset globally. Notably, these milestones highlights the increasing institutional and mainstream recognition of DOGE, contributing to its ongoing price rally. In addition to Ali’s technical insights, another analyst, Trader Tardigrade, shared a long-term perspective on Dogecoin. The analyst pointed out that DOGE maintains a recognizable wave pattern on its macro chart, predicting a potential blow-off top that could see the cryptocurrency reaching as high as $20. # Dogecoin maintains a wave pattern on the macro chart 🔥 Next blow-off top predicted at $20 🚀 pic.twitter.com/8U9DvuBLCm — Trader Tardigrade (@TATrader_Alan) November 27, 2024 Featured image created with DALL-E, Chart from tradingview",NEUTRAL,DOGE,ALTCOIN | BUSINESS | DOGE | SPONSORED | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-hits-critical-resistance-will-it-surge-past-0-40-or-face-a-price-dip/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/36938418.jpeg

The next big thing is already here, and it’s called BTFD Coin—a presale that’s quickly turning heads and sending investors into FOMO overdrive. Let’s take a look at the turbo-charged success of Turbo and how BTFD Coin is stepping up to deliver even more opportunities for those who want in on the meme coin magic before it’s too late. Turbo: The Meme Coin That Left Everyone in the Dust Turbo Coin didn’t just race to the front of the meme coin pack—it burned rubber. When Turbo dropped, it became the “hot coin” everyone was talking about. With a catchy name and a community that absolutely rallied behind it, Turbo made waves and shot to the moon faster than a Formula 1 car on a straightaway. What made Turbo such a success? It was more than just a meme—it had the entire crypto ecosystem buzzing, with liquidity pools, staking rewards, and plenty of community-driven hype to fuel the fire. The thing that turbocharged its success was its ability to build a strong, committed community that believed in its potential. It wasn’t about simply being a “joke coin” but about creating something that felt fresh and exciting within the meme coin space. As soon as Turbo hit the market, the people who were lucky enough to get in early saw explosive returns. But if you didn’t catch it on the way up, don’t panic—BTFD Coin is giving you a golden ticket to a new ride.

Whether you’re a seasoned crypto veteran or someone who’s just now getting into the meme coin game, the presale is offering an entry point that could make you part of the next big success story. Let’s talk numbers. Imagine you invest $360 in the BTFD Coin presale. At the current price of $0.000038 per token, you’d snag about 9.47 million coins. If BTFD Coin reaches a modest target of $0.0006 per coin—an entirely achievable goal, especially given the momentum behind the coin—you’d be looking at a potential return of $5,682. That’s a solid payday for anyone willing to get in early. And remember, the best part is that you’re not just banking on hype; BTFD Coin is delivering real utility with staking rewards that are absolutely off the charts. We’re talking an average 90% annual percentage yield (APY), meaning your investment could keep growing exponentially over time.

Bitcoin Enters ‘Uncharted Territory’ In addition to the bullish outlook provided by the data and figures recorded over the past three weeks in crypto prices, market analysts are optimistic about Bitcoin’s future, with Alex Thorn, head of research at Galaxy Digital, claiming that “the Bitcoin bull market has legs.” Thorn acknowledges the possibility of corrections and “regulatory jitters” stemming from the outgoing Biden administration but believes that increasing adoption from institutional, corporate, and potentially nation-state entities will drive Bitcoin’s price higher in the near to medium term. Related Reading: BNB Eyes Recovery: $605 Support Sets The Stage For A New Rally Katie Stockton of Fairlead Strategies also highlighted that Bitcoin investors are currently in “uncharted territory” regarding resistance levels, meaning there are few historical price points to indicate potential pullbacks. Support is identified around $74,000, suggesting a solid foundation for future growth. Stockton further claimed: Bitcoin does tend to stair step both to the downside and to the upside, meaning that it sees these very sharp runups and then consolidates. People should … be willing to give Bitcoin, and the cryptocurrencies in general, more room because of the volatility there and also because of the long-term potential. With a year-to-date gain of 124%, Bitcoin remains on track to cross the $100,000 threshold before the end of the year. By comparison, Ethereum (ETH), the second largest cryptocurrency, has also performed well since the election but lags behind BTC with a year-to-date gain of 55%.

You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  A crypto czar … and a crypto ambassador  The narrative  Nearly three weeks after the 2024 election, we're still waiting for clear signs of how President-elect Donald Trump's administration might approach crypto. Here's what we know so far.  Why it matters  A large chunk of the crypto industry is betting that Trump's administration will be friendlier toward crypto than President Joe Biden's administration was. Companies are filing for new exchange-traded products tied to crypto and prices shot up in the immediate aftermath of the election.  Breaking it down  The next administration may include a White House official specifically to oversee crypto policy. It's unclear just what this person might do, what sort of budget or staff they may command or just how much authority they will wield. Nevertheless, there are discussions about creating a crypto czar to either oversee policymaking or liaise with policymakers.  Bloomberg first reported that Trump might appoint a crypto czar.  As a White House position, the role would likely be more focused on political engagement than policymaking, perhaps as a liaison with federal regulators or the independent agencies. The czar could drive the White House's priorities around crypto — whatever those might end up being — as lawmakers draft bills. A lot remains to be seen.  Trump's business ventures also appear to be tightening their relationships with the industry. World Liberty Financial, the Trump-backed crypto project, sold $30 million worth of WLFI tokens on Monday to Justin Sun, best known for his roles with Tron and HTX (formerly Huobi), as well as his brief stint as an ambassador for Grenada to the World Trade Organization.  Prior to Sun's buy, World Liberty Financial had only sold about $21 million worth of tokens. At the $30 million mark, a company Trump controls would begin to receive proceeds from further sales — and Sun's buy pushed the total sales past that threshold. World Liberty Financial's sales, which had been sluggish prior to Monday, also saw additional boosts from other buyers after Sun's purchase.  World Liberty Financial announced Sun would join it as an adviser a day later.  Another of Trump's companies, Trump Media and Technology Group — Truth Social's parent company — is considering acquiring Bakkt, a crypto trading platform launched by Intercontinental Exchange (ICE, the New York Stock Exchange's parent company), according to The Financial Times. Bakkt's first CEO was Kelly Loeffler, who was later appointed a U.S. Senator and is the wife of ICE CEO Jeffrey Sprecher. Loeffler is also a co-chair of Trump's inaugural committee.  TMTG's interest in Bakkt was reported a day after Truth Social applied for a trademark for ""TRUTHFI,"" which the application said would refer to digital wallet software that includes cryptocurrency payment processing and custody services. The New York Times first reported on the application.

Ripple Drops Another $25M Into Crypto PAC to Sway 2026 Congressional Races: Ripple has committed $25 million to the Fairshake crypto super political action committee, bringing its fresh funds to $73 million so far for the 2026 election cycle. Fairshake already has $30 million left over from the 2024 cycle, so the war chest totals $103 million.  Tornado Cash Sanctions Overturned by U.S. Appeals Court; TORN Soars Over 500%: The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the U.S. Treasury Department exceeded its authority in sanctioning Tornado Cash, saying ""immutable smart contracts … are not the 'property' of a foreign national or entity."" Coinbase was among the plaintiffs who brought the case.  Vitalik Buterin Donated $1M in Ether to Coin Center Hours After Tornado Cash Victory: Coin Center, which has its own case over the Tornado Cash sanctions pending before the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, received $1 million from Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin.  Crypto Gains Let Poor People Buy Houses, U.S. Research Finds, But Risks May Lurk: Crypto owners may have used their gains to buy houses at a greater rate than the broader U.S. population, the Treasury Department's Office of Financial Research said in a new paper.

Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Is Pointing At ‘Greed’ Again The “Fear & Greed Index” refers to an indicator created by Alternative that tells us about the average sentiment among investors in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency markets. This metric uses a scale from zero to a hundred to represent its value. All values greater than 53 imply the presence of greed among the traders, while those under 47 suggest fear in the market. The index reflects a net-neutral mentality in the region between these two cutoffs. Related Reading: Current Bitcoin Hashrate Can Sustain $4.9 Trillion Cap, CryptoQuant CEO Reveals Besides these three main sentiments, the indicator can also signal two special sentiments: extreme fear and extreme greed. The former occupies the region below 25 and the latter above 75. Now, here is what the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index is saying regarding the current market sentiment: As is visible above, the index has a value of 75, which means that the investors share a sentiment of greed right now. This mentality is also particularly strong, as the indicator’s value is right on the boundary of the extreme greed zone. Historically, the extreme mentalities have proven to be quite significant for Bitcoin and other digital assets, as it’s when the index is in these zones, the prices tend to hit major points of reversal. However, the relationship between the two is inverse, meaning bottoms are likely to happen when the market is the most fearful, while tops occur in times of immense greed. Followers of a trading technique called contrarian investing leverage this fact to make their trades; they buy in extreme fear and sell during extreme greed. Warren Buffet’s famous quote also sums up this idea, “be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” While the current value of the index is high, it was much higher during the last few days, as the below chart shows. The Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index was firmly inside the extreme greed territory as the rally in the asset took place, with a peak of 94 occurring alongside the cryptocurrency’s top above the $99,000 level. Thus, it appears Bitcoin has once again moved contrary to the crowd’s expectations, as its price has registered a notable drawdown since this extreme greed high. Ideally, the sentiment would cool off into the fear region for a reversal in the asset. Still, during bull runs, where demand is extraordinarily high, a refresh into the neutral or normal greed zone is often enough for the rally to regain steam. Related Reading: Bitcoin Crashes Under $93,000: What’s Behind It? With the Fear & Greed Index inside the greed region again, it remains to be seen whether Bitcoin will be able to find a rebound.

Several reports declare Paul Atkins, a veteran financial regulator, as the current favorite for the role. After his tenure as an SEC commissioner during the George W. Bush administration, Atkins founded Patomak Global Partners, a consulting firm for major financial industry clients. He also worked as an independent compliance consultant and court-appointed monitor in settlements involving federal agencies and regulators. In 2016, he joined Trump’s economic advisory team, which included CEOs from Disney, JPMorgan, General Motors, and BlackRock. According to a Bloomberg report, Donald Trump has already interviewed Paul Atkins and considers him to be a leading candidate for the position of the next SEC Chair. Trump is expected to announce his pick in the coming days, but no decision has been made yet. Following the news, Atkins’ odds on the prediction market Kalshi shot up to 60%, leaving behind two other possible candidates, Binance US ex-CEO Brian Brooks and Teresa Goody Guillen, a former SEC attorney who now represents blockchain companies. Atkins previously testified before Congress on restructuring the SEC to improve its efficiency and cut expenses, which is again in line with Trump’s vow to roll back government spending. If selected, Atkins' appointment bodes well for crypto. A known advocate for blockchain and digital innovation, Atkins is anticipated to be a prime candidate for reversing the purported damage done to the industry by Gensler’s SEC. “Atkins is someone who is not only crypto-savvy but possesses a deep understanding of the inner workings of the agency as both a former commissioner and staffer. Atkins is seen as being capable of establishing a pro-innovation agenda while returning the agency to the so-called ‘golden standard’ many in the Republican Party feel was lost under Gensler,” claimed Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terrett. A crypto skeptic during his first term, Donald Trump emerged as an industry’s favorite on the 2024 campaign trail, all thanks to his bold promises to establish the national Bitcoin reserve, keep Bitcoin miners in the US, and create a crypto presidential advisory council. But most importantly, Trump promised to fire Gary Gensler “on day one,” much to the cheering of the crypto crowd, who has long had their knives out for the SEC Chairman known for his aggressive approach to the industry. Trump's promise, while enticing to many, is not straightforward to execute. SEC officials are appointed for five-year terms and cannot be removed without cause. However, it is customary for the SEC Chair to step down after a party change, allowing the new administration to implement its economic policy. Gensler earned himself a reputation as tough on crypto, as evidenced by the slew of enforcement actions against the companies and individuals in the industry. Under his tenure, the agency brought more than 100 actions against crypto firms, including high-profile lawsuits against exchanges Coinbase, Kraken, and Gemini. Gensler’s SEC also shared credit with other government agencies for putting FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried and Binance’s Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao behind bars. CFTC to get oversight of the US crypto market In multiple interviews, Gary Gensler stated that most digital assets already belong under his agency’s jurisdiction, and the enforcement actions dreaded by crypto companies are simply meant as a tool to bring the sector under compliance. Now, Donald Trump is about to challenge this stance. Trump’s team is reportedly considering shifting the authority over the crypto market from SEC to CFTC, a step believed to grant the industry the long-sought-after regulatory clarity. According to Fox Business sources, the CFTC's role may be expanded to include the regulation of spot markets for digital commodities—such as Bitcoin and Ether—and exchanges that facilitate their trade. If made a reality, this would mean a big win for the industry that has long signaled it would prefer to do business with the agency over the SEC. To start policing crypto more effectively, the CFTC would need a significant injection of funds. Currently, the operating budget of the agency for 2024 is $706 million, more than four times smaller than the SEC’s $3 billion. SEC also employs seven times more staff than the CFTC. In July, CFTC’s outgoing Chairman Rostin Behnam asked the agriculture committee for more funding to regulate the crypto market more efficiently. Behnam pointed out that half of the agency’s enforcement actions in 2024 have been brought against crypto businesses, which he called a ‘staggering statistic’ for the agency with no mandate over the industry. “The SEC has great bones, but whoever leads it next will need great policy chops as well as great admin skills to bring it back to being a contributing part of an administrative agenda,” former CFTC chair Chris Giancarlo told Fox Business.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6283/will-paul-atkins-replace-gary-gensler-as-the-next-sec-chair,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

Ethereum’s scaling solutions and Monero’s commitment to privacy have been dominating headlines. But there’s another player stealing the spotlight. Qubetics ($TICS) is reshaping the blockchain space with its innovative scalability features and a groundbreaking presale that’s already raised $3.4 million. Let’s dive into why these three cryptocurrencies are the best crypto to invest in now. Ethereum Continues To Impress With Scaling Innovations Ethereum remains the king of decentralised applications, and it’s not slowing down. Recently, Ethereum’s rollup technology has gained attention for improving network efficiency. By bundling transactions off-chain, rollups significantly reduce congestion and fees, making Ethereum more accessible for both developers and users. This is a big step in ensuring that Ethereum stays relevant in a space filled with faster competitors. Staking on Ethereum is also hitting new highs, with the network’s Proof of Stake model attracting long-term investors. It’s clear that Ethereum is solidifying its position as a dependable blockchain for decentralised finance and NFTs. Analysts are even hinting at a potential price surge, further cementing its status as a top choice for anyone searching for the best crypto to invest in now. While Ethereum’s updates are impressive, its high gas fees still pose challenges. For businesses and developers looking for more cost-effective solutions, Qubetics offers an appealing alternative with its seamless multi-chain integration and unmatched scalability. Monero Strengthens Its Privacy Game Monero has always been the go-to cryptocurrency for privacy enthusiasts, and its latest upgrades are taking security to the next level. The network recently implemented Bulletproofs++ technology, which reduces transaction sizes and boosts efficiency without compromising privacy. This makes Monero a favourite among those who value discretion in their financial dealings. The demand for Monero has surged as regulators worldwide tighten their grip on crypto transactions. Monero’s ability to keep transactions private while maintaining a robust network makes it one of the best crypto to invest in now for individuals prioritising security and anonymity. However, Monero’s limited scalability and lack of interoperability leave room for improvement. This is where Qubetics steps in, offering a comprehensive solution that combines privacy with scalability. Businesses and individuals who need a more versatile platform might find Qubetics a better fit. Qubetics Sets New Standards In Scalability And Accessibility Qubetics is redefining blockchain scalability with its multi-chain wallet, making it a standout project in today’s crowded crypto market. Unlike Ethereum and Monero, which cater to niche needs, Qubetics focuses on creating a unified ecosystem where different blockchains work together effortlessly. Imagine a small business owner managing payments across multiple blockchains. With Qubetics, all transactions are streamlined into a single wallet, simplifying operations and reducing costs. Freelancers accepting payments in various cryptocurrencies can also benefit from this user-friendly solution, eliminating the hassle of juggling multiple wallets and platforms. Even everyday crypto users will appreciate the ease of managing their assets in one place. The ongoing Qubetics presale is another reason it’s becoming the best crypto to invest in now. Over 231 million tokens have been sold to more than 4,500 holders, raising $3.4 million. Priced at $0.025 per token, $TICS is a golden opportunity for investors before the 10% price surge in the next stage. For instance, a $100,000 investment at the current price could grow exponentially. If $TICS hits $0.25 at the presale’s end, the ROI would be 871%, turning that initial investment into $971,000. Post-mainnet launch, prices could skyrocket to $15, delivering a jaw-dropping return of 58,213%, turning the same $100,000 into $58 million. These figures make Qubetics one of the most promising investments in the market today. Conclusion Ethereum and Monero have proven themselves as giants in their respective niches, but Qubetics is setting a new benchmark. Ethereum’s scaling solutions and Monero’s privacy enhancements are impressive, yet Qubetics offers a more versatile and scalable approach that meets the needs of businesses, professionals, and individual users alike. The $TICS presale is more than just a financial opportunity. It’s a chance to back a project that’s shaping the future of blockchain. Visit the Qubetics site, secure your tokens, and position yourself for potentially life-changing returns. For those searching for the best crypto to invest in now, Qubetics is the name to watch.

Through this plan, Sim may not have created a Bitcoin reserve as the U.S. did, but he wanted to make Bitcoin a diversified asset for the city of Vancouver. Simply put, it’s adding Bitcoin into their investment portfolio and gaining exposure from the price movement in the cryptocurrency market. Numerous companies have already taken action, including pension funds, state investment managers, and financial asset managers. Some figures even promote the use of Bitcoin for campaign purposes. “Preserving of the city’s purchasing power through diversification of financial resources: Becoming a Bitcoin-friendly city,” Sim said in the video meeting published .

According to his detailed price chart, Dogecoin is currently in wave 3 of the Elliott Wave Theory and set for a significant price surge. Analyst Predicts Dogecoin Price Macro Target Hov, a crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter), has discussed Dogecoin‘s future price movements based on the Elliott Wave Theory and its current price action. The analyst noted that the meme coin has received a remarkable 690% rally since recently reaching a critical macro entry level. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash Not Over? Why A Decline To $89,000 Is Possible According to Hov’s chart analysis, the Dogecoin price action is currently in the midst of its third Elliott Wave, a phase often characterized by solid price growth. The third wave is typically seen as the strongest of all five wave motive sequences of the Elliott Wave theory and is also considered bullish. The price chart shows that Dogecoin is entering its third wave after recently breaking out of a prolonged consolidation period within a critical support zone around $0.27. While Hov has forecasted a rise to the macro targets at $2.2 – $3.46, the analyst has also revealed that the Dogecoin price could reach an ultimate target of $4.2 if it maintains a strong bullish momentum. This substantial price increase would require Dogecoin surging by 976% from its current value. Analyst Reveals Next Dogecoin Local Tops While the DOGE price steadily approaches the $1 mark, crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade has released the upcoming local tops for the number one meme coin. The analyst disclosed that Dogecoin had successfully recorded multiple local market tops in the last year following a substantial price rally. He also revealed that each local top had a 2X relationship, where the Dogecoin price had doubled in the previous three local tops. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Closes Above Bull Channel, Crypto Analyst Reveals What’s Next Following the analyst’s chart, Dogecoin reached a local top of $0.11 in October 2023, jumping 2X to hit another top of around $0.22 in April 2024. Interestingly, the same bullish pattern occurred again around October this year, with the meme coin doubling its previous price high to reach a local price peak of around $0.44 this month. Based on this bullish pattern, where the Dogecoin price has historically multiplied by 2X with each local top, Trader Tardigrade predicts that the meme coin will continue this trend until it reaches an all-time high of $5. The analyst has projected that Dogecoin could see its next local top at $0.88 by April 2025. Additionally, around July 2025, the analyst predicts that Dogecoin will double again and surpass the $1 milestone to hit $1.76. Extending towards October 2025, the analyst has also projected that the Dogecoin price is expected to rally to $3.52.

After Bitcoin’s ( BTC/USDT ) failed assault on $100K and a correction to the $90K+ zone, the market buzz is building for another attempt at six figures. Meanwhile, the Altcoin Season Index (ASI) has surged to 61, inching closer to the magical 75+ mark that signals a full-blown altseason. Thanksgiving could become even sweeter if altcoins start taking the spotlight—but let’s not get ahead of ourselves. Source: coinmarketcap.com While early signs of altcoin strength are emerging, emotional decisions can be costly. To time this transition properly, we turn to three critical charts: 1. BTC Dominance ( BTC.D ) – Tracks Bitcoin's share of the market.2. ETH/BTC – Ethereum’s performance as the altcoin market leader.3. TOTAL2 – The total market cap of altcoins, excluding Bitcoin, for macro confirmation. Let’s dissect the evidence before jumping to conclusions. Chart 1: BTC Dominance (BTC.D) - Weekly Bitcoin dominance remains in a precarious position within a rising channel on the weekly timeframe, where three critical levels dictate the narrative: 1. Horizontal Support (~58%):o This multi-year pivot zone has historically acted as a foundation for BTC dominance. Losing it would significantly weaken Bitcoin's hold on the market.2. Channel Support (Lower Border):o The rising channel has defined BTC dominance since early 2023. A break below it would suggest a structural shift, favoring altcoins.3. 50-Week Moving Average (~55.5%):o This dynamic level has acted as a trend decider. Losing it would further solidify bearish dominance for Bitcoin and strengthen the case for altseason. What to Watch: • A breakdown below all three levels, potentially confirmed by a retest from below, would validate a rotation into altcoins.• Beware of temporary dominance spikes during flash crashes, as Bitcoin often serves as a safe haven during volatility. Chart 2: ETH/BTC – Daily Ethereum vs. Bitcoin offers a critical view of altcoin strength. The pair has shown signs of life, attempting to break out of a descending channel after months of underperformance. Key observations include: 1. Resistance at 0.038:o ETH/BTC is battling the upper boundary of its descending channel and the 50-day moving average. A decisive breakout here could mark the beginning of a trend reversal.2. Key Market Structure Level at 0.0415:o Reclaiming 0.0415 is critical for confirming a bullish market structure and positioning Ethereum as the leader of the altcoin rally.3. Volume Support:o Recent increases in trading volume suggest growing investor confidence. Paired with a breakout, this could confirm a reversal. What to Watch: • A breakout above 0.0415 would signal strength, while further rejection could delay an altseason rally. Ethereum's performance often sets the tone for altcoins. Chart 3: TOTAL2 – Weekly The TOTAL2 chart, which tracks the total market cap of altcoins excluding Bitcoin, is perhaps the cleanest of all indicators. It recently broke out of a massive three-year Cup & Handle (C&H) pattern, signaling long-term bullish potential. 1. The Breakout:o The C&H breakout above $2.6T is a textbook bullish signal, confirmed by a significant volume spike.2. Targets:o Based on the C&H projection, TOTAL2 could rise 200% from its bottom, targeting around $5.2T.3. Support Zones:o As long as TOTAL2 stays above $2.6T, the bullish structure remains intact. Any retest of this level would provide further confirmation. Why It Matters:This breakout indicates a shift in the macro trend for altcoins. It suggests the potential for a sustained altcoin rally if Bitcoin dominance weakens and ETH/BTC aligns. Conclusion: Is Altseason and Santa Rally Incoming? The setup for an altseason looks increasingly promising. BTC dominance flirts with critical support, ETH/BTC eyes a reversal, and TOTAL2 has confirmed a major bullish breakout. Combine these with the potential for a Santa Rally, and the stage could be set for a spectacular finish to 2024. That said, as the classic trading wisdom goes: ""Confirmation is key."" Acting on one chart alone is reckless; when all three align, the probabilities for a successful altcoin rotation increase dramatically. For those celebrating Thanksgiving, enjoy the holiday—just don’t overindulge, whether it’s on turkey or early altcoin shopping.

With its presale kicking off at a jaw-dropping $0.000004, it’s an enticing option for those looking to get in on the ground floor. Analysts predict that BTFD will list at around $0.0006 after the presale—a potential 15x return for early investors. If you’ve been looking for a chance to make significant gains, this is it! But what really sets BTFD apart? For starters, the Play-to-Earn game offers a unique twist. Unlike traditional investments where you simply hold onto coins, BTFD encourages users to earn while having fun. Imagine playing a game and watching your crypto wallet grow with every victory. This engaging approach resonates particularly well with Gen Z and Millennials, who value interactive experiences that provide real rewards. It’s not just about buying and holding; it’s about being part of a community that’s actively participating in something exciting. Moreover, BTFD offers staking options with impressive APYs. This means that not only can you earn from the P2E game, but you can also generate passive income by simply holding onto your tokens. Let’s break this down: if you invest $10,000 during the presale, you’d scoop up about 2.5 billion BTFD coins. When the price hits $0.0006, your investment could skyrocket to around $1.5 million! That’s an incredible opportunity that’s hard to pass up, making BTFD Coin one of the best meme coin presales to get involved with. The community aspect is another winning feature. The “Bulls Squad” is a dedicated group of supporters who spread the word about BTFD and its unique offerings. This grassroots movement fosters loyalty and excitement among holders, creating a vibrant ecosystem that’s only going to grow. With all these elements combined, BTFD Coin is poised to make a significant impact in the meme coin space, and you won’t want to miss out. Floki Inu: The Established Meme Coin Now, let’s shift gears and talk about Floki Inu. Launched in 2021, it quickly gained traction, leveraging the popularity of meme coins and the charismatic branding of Elon Musk’s Shiba Inu. Floki Inu has generated significant hype through clever marketing, community engagement, and a slew of partnerships that have kept investors intrigued. Many who got in early saw impressive returns, and the coin has built a loyal following along the way. However, Floki Inu isn’t without its challenges. While it has a solid community and some innovative features, the meme coin market is notoriously volatile. Investors who got caught up in the hype often faced rollercoaster price swings. One minute it’s climbing, and the next, it’s plummeting. This unpredictability can be a major concern for potential investors. The question remains: can Floki Inu sustain its momentum amid the influx of new competitors like BTFD Coin? Despite these hurdles, Floki Inu has established itself as a significant player in the meme coin realm. It has proven that community-driven projects can achieve remarkable success, but as newer options emerge, it must work harder to keep its audience engaged. With BTFD Coin offering exciting features like a P2E game and staking rewards, there’s a chance that some investors might shift their focus away from Floki Inu to explore what BTFD has to offer. This makes it crucial for Floki Inu to continue evolving and providing value to its community. In summary, while Floki Inu has made a name for itself, the landscape is changing rapidly. For those who missed out on its latest buzz, BTFD Coin is emerging as the best meme coin presale to keep on your radar. With innovative features and a passionate community, it could very well be the next big thing. Conclusion In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency, Floki Inu has carved out its niche as a beloved meme coin. However, as new contenders like BTFD Coin rise to prominence, investors have more options than ever. With its engaging Play-to-Earn game, attractive staking options, and a vibrant community, BTFD Coin stands out as the best meme coin presale to consider. If you missed the Floki Inu hype, don’t let this opportunity slip through your fingers. BTFD Coin is positioned for explosive growth, and with such an enticing presale price and the potential for massive returns, it’s a chance you won’t want to miss.
