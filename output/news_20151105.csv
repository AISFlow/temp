42378330,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7hyRF,1446762922,Bidder Turnout Ties All-Time Low in Final Silk Road Bitcoin Auction,"The fourth and final US Marshals (USMS) auction of bitcoins confiscated during the investigation into online black market Silk Road drew only 11 bidders today, the lowest total since the second auction held in December 2014.  The government agency indicated that 11 registered bidders submitted a total of 30 bids on 22 blocks of bitcoins during today's auction. Twenty-one of the blocks were for 2,000 BTC (valued at $790,000 at press time), while the final block included 2,341 BTC (roughly $926,200).  Participation was once again down sharply from the first auction of nearly 30,000 BTC held in June 2014, when 45 registered bidders placed 63 bids. All the bitcoins for sale at that event were purchased by investor Tim Draper, who revealed to CoinDesk today he did not participate in the latest auction.  Bidder participation rose slightly for a third auction held in March 2015, when 14 bidders placed 34 bids, and the majority of the bitcoins were claimed by secretive bitcoin mining company Cumberland Mining.  A spokesperson for the government agency indicated that submitted bids are currently being reviewed and that the auction is in an ""evaluation process"".  The USMS said:  ""No further information will be released until the conclusion of the auction process, when financial transactions have been completed and bitcoins have been transferred to the winner(s).""  The earliest a bidder could announce that they successfully purchased bitcoins at the auction, according to the USMS, would be Monday, once such transfers are finalized.

42378344,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7hyhb,1446760822,IMF Chief: Banks Shouldn't Fear Bitcoin or the Blockchain,"Christine Lagarde, chief of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and finance minister under former French president Nicolas Sarkozy, said this week that banks don’t have much to fear from bitcoin or the blockchain.  The Financial Times reported today that, while speaking at a conference in New York City, Lagarde said attendees worried that the banking industry could be altered or rendered obsolete by the blockchain should ""pause for a second"".  ""Many of you have heard about not only bitcoins but blockchains and that unbelievable technology that underlies the bitcoins of this world at the moment, and how incredibly convenient it will be to actually generate trust and identify players and whatever pseudo they decide to use,"" she said, according to FT. ""And many of you in the industry are actually worried that those technologies are going to massively disrupt the current industry.""  ""Pause for a second,"" she is said to have told the bankers, continuing:  ""If those new technologies, and as long as those new technologies are going to abuse, take advantage of, the yield for anonymity, I think the banking industry has quite a few good days ahead of it as long as it takes ownership of those issues of capital and culture in order to actually restore the trust without which you see no trade, no transaction, no business can take place.”  According to FT, Lagarde’s comments referenced a report by FT Alphaville’s Izabella Kaminska on the connection between the recent rise in the price of bitcoin and a suspected Ponzi scheme operating in Asia.  Lagarde has run the IMF since 2011, when she took over from Dominique Strauss-Kahn, another former French finance minister who resigned from the IMF in the wake of sexual assault allegations and an arrest in New York City.  Prior to serving as finance minister, Lagarde ran other French ministries, including the Ministry of Agriculture.

42378350,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7hymd,1446740850,Fake LocalBitcoins Android App is Phishing For Bitcoins,"UPDATE (7th November 05:19 BST): The fraudulent LocalBitcoins app has been removed from the Google Play app store.      A fake LocalBitcoins app is being distributed on the Google Play store in a bid to steal user bitcoins.  The Helsinki-based bitcoin exchange said that it has reached out to the app store to have the fraudulent app removed. LocalBitcoins staff said earlier today that upon download the fake app seeks “to get access to your account by having you activate HMAC authentication for your account”.  Five reviewers on the Google Play store posted claims that their bitcoins had been stolen as a result of downloading the app.  Kangas said in an email that at this time he “cannot comment whether this phishing app has resulted in stolen bitcoins”, adding:  “At the app page it shows that the app has 10 downloads (from which at least part are purchased downloads and reviews), which indicates that most of the people are aware enough, to not install these suspicious looking apps. We are working to get these completely disabled from app store.”  The app was last updated on 28th October and has been downloaded between 10 and 50 times, according to the store page. An email attributed to the developers as well as the website associated with that email were not working at press time.  Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The venture capitalist and Draper Fisher Jurvetson (DFJ) partner was the sole winner of the first US government auction of nearly 30,000 BTC (then valued at roughly $18m) held last July, again purchasing 2,000 BTC (worth $750,000) in an auction of 50,000 BTC held in December 2014.

Draper did not elaborate on any reasons underpinning the decision.  Confirmed participants  in the auction so far include bitcoin hedge fund Binary Financial and over-the-counter bitcoin trading firm Genesis Trading.

Representatives of the US Marshals Service (USMS), the government agency overseeing the auction, did not respond to requests for clarity as to when any winner in today’s auction could be expected to be announced.

42378334,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7hyXX,1446726307,Jamie Dimon: Bitcoin Will Not Survive,"JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has issued new remarks about bitcoin, dismissing the digital currency's potential to survive in the long-term.  Speaking at the Fortune Global Forum  , Dimon said people were wasting their time with digital currencies such as bitcoin.  He added:  ""This is my personal opinion, there will be no real, non-controlled currency in the world. There is no government that's going to put up with it for long ... there will be no currency that gets around government controls.""  According to Dimon, bitcoin's underlying blockchain technology has a brighter future: ""The technology will be used, it may even be used to transport currency but it will be US dollars.""  Dimon's latest comments come after he spoke about both bitcoin and blockchain technology during Barclays' Global Financial Services Conference held in September.  Although cautious, the bitcoin skeptic said that JPMorgan – which recently partnered with distributed ledger startup R3CEV – was optimistic about the potential uses of blockchain technology.  In April this year, Dimon said his bank could learn from disruptive payment systems such as bitcoin in his annual letter to JPMorgan shareholders:  ""You all have read about bitcoin, merchants building their own networks, PayPal and PayPal look-alikes. Payments are a critical business for us – and we are quite good at it. But there is much for us to learn in terms of real-time systems, better encryption techniques and a reduction of costs and 'pain points' for customers.""  Dimon's comments on blockchain technology come amid increasing interest from banks and mainstream finance figures such as Blythe Masters, who famously left JPMorgan to join Digital Assets Holdings as CEO in March this year.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Yessi Bello Perez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/11/05/jamie-dimon-bitcoin-will-not-survive,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dcddd6b32ff405e02271c8adec1e7870e1667cf8-1500x568.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
