42405623,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAedkN3,1609976867,"Trump Signs Order to Ban Ma's Alipay, Other Chinese Apps","U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive orderhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-addressing-threat-posed-applications-software-developed-controlled-chinese-companies/ on Tuesday banning the Alipay payment platform and seven other apps with links to China, saying the apps can access private information from their users.    Separately, U.S. officials are considering banning U.S. citizens from investing in Alibaba Group, an affiliate of Alipay's parent, and Tencent Holdings, people familiar with the matter told Dow Jones. No decision has been made while agencies debate the possible effect on the markets, the sources said.      Tuesday's executive order bans transactions using CamScanner, QQ Wallet, SHAREit, Tencent QQ, VMate, WeChat Pay, and WPS Office and Alipay, which is the payments platform owned by Chinese billionaire Jack Ma's Ant Group Co.      The crackdown comes ahead of China's launch of its central bank digital currency (CBDC), which is thought to have influenced China's own crackdown on Ant Financial and other Jack Ma companies.      In October, speaking at an event in Shanghai, Ma criticized China's financial system and its state-dominated banking sector, “We shouldn’t use the way to manage a train station to regulate an airport,"" said Ma, ""We cannot regulate the future with yesterday’s means.”      Since making the comments Ma has been keeping a low profile and his Ant Group initial public offering has been suspended by regulators.      Industry watchers have said the People’s Bank of China is using the digital yuan as part of a broader effort to curb the growth of Alipay and WeChat Pay.      The launch of a CBDC is also expected to stunt Alipay’s micro-lending business and provide the unbanked with financial services, while also drawing back deposits for commercial banks.      China has been accelerating its efforts on the CBDC front and appears to be well ahead of the U.S. in developing a digital currency, according to analysts.

The justification for the order is also curious, given that all kinds of apps in the U.S. and elsewhere, whether financial or otherwise, have the power to access people's private information.      The executive order goes into effect in 45 days and states that the apps are forbidden because they pose a threat to U.S. national security.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,"Tanzeel Akhtar, Kevin Reynolds",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/01/06/trump-signs-order-to-ban-mas-alipay-other-chinese-apps,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e5b6390423de95654c5be71dab085977d0e5abf8-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42405632,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAedkVu,1609976132,Total Cryptocurrency Market Value Hits Record $1 Trillion,"The total value of all cryptocurrencies passed $1 trillion Wednesday for the first time ever, per CoinGecko's index of 6,124 assets. At its prior peak in late 2017, the market's total capitalization was just above $760 billion, according to TradingView.      Bitcoin represents roughly 69% of the market's value, according to Messari.      Traders aren't surprised by the market's soaring value.      ""Is it frothy? A little bit in the short term,"" said Qiao Wang, co-founder of decentralized finance (DeFi) accelerator firm DeFi Alliance and former quantitative trader at Tower Research. ""But is it ridiculous,"" he asked rhetorically. ""Nope.""      Over the past 12 months, the nearly parabolic rise of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has come as deep-pocketed institutional investors show increasing interest in bitcoin with a new crop of retail investors following their lead and showing some interesting in alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) as well.      Bitcoin has already gained 25% in January, following its more than 300% gain in 2020. Ethereum has also soared over the past 12 months, reaching a total gain of roughly 860% Wednesday after trading above $1,200 for the first time since early 2018.      ""The $1 trillion mark cements cryptocurrency as a investable asset class that no longer sits on the fringes of Traditional Finance as a toy for retail investors,"" said Jack Purdy, decentralized finance analyst at Messari. ""It demonstrates that this asset class is large enough to absorb large orders like we've seen recently with the slew of institutions entering over the last few months.""      Some of those large investments have come from firms like technology firm MicroStrategy, who has scooped up over 70,000 BTC with plans to buy more, and London-based asset manager Ruffer Investment, who dumped $740 million into bitcoin toward the end of 2020.      ""Cryptocurrencies are now almost an institutional-grade venture bet,"" Wang told CoinDesk. ""The market is finally liquid enough to deploy large sums of capital, but still early enough for a 10x return.""      For some investors, those returns are coming from altcoins. As bitcoin continues to climb above $30,000, altcoin indexes have gained momentum.      Per FTX's markets, its index of 10 leading altcoins has rallied over 30% in 2021. The ""shitcoin"" index, representing micro-cap altcoins, has also gained over 20% so far in January.      ""A trillion-dollar market cap is a big milestone for crypto, especially considering it was below $200 billion less than a year ago,"" said Nate Maddrey, research analyst at Coin Metrics, in a direct message with CoinDesk. ""But crypto’s total market cap is still only a fraction of gold, equities, and many other assets.""      From ""sh**coin"" indexes to the bellwether assets like bitcoin, institutional buyers and retail speculators alike can likely find something to pique there interest in this newly minted, trillion-dollar market.      ""Crypto is in a unique position to be the most important asset class of the 21st century and still has a lot of room to grow,"" Maddrey said.",POSITIVE,BTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | ZRX,Zack Voell,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/01/06/total-cryptocurrency-market-value-hits-record-1-trillion,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/619460953491bd959f62e4254141793a923fcb31-915x624.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405636,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAedkap,1609970013,Maker's MKR Token Surges to 2-Year High on DeFi Growth,"Prices for MKR, an Ethereum-based governance token, surged to their highest levels in more than two years on Wednesday.      MKR was trading at $1,068.53 as of press time, up 44% in the past 24 hours. However, it was trading at $1,251.14 earlier in the day, close to its Jan. 21, 2018, record of $1,798.70.      Analysts told CoinDesk the recent rally was just a delayed and long-anticipated result of the rapid growth of the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. MKR is the governance token for both Maker's decentralized lending platform and the decentralized autonomous organization, MakerDAO.      Yan Liberman, co-founder of Delphi Digital, a research and consulting boutique specializing in digital assets, attributed the price rally to the sharply increased supply in dai, the native stablecoin for MakerDAO.      Dai is created when Ethereum blockchain users deposit one of many assets into the Maker Protocol and borrow against that asset in the form of dai. On the other hand, the MKR gives its holders voting rights on the development of Maker Protocol and dai.      Notably, the DeFi sector is becoming popular again with more than $21.6 billion total value locked as of press time, according to data collected by DeFi Pulse.      Compared with the white-hot ""DeFi summer"" of last year when MKR's price stayed ""dormant,"" the fundamentals of the token have improved over the past year leading to demand for it, according to Ryan Watkins, a research analyst at Messari.      ""In the beginning, MKR wasn’t generating any revenue from [dai's growing demand] because the interest it charged on users borrowing dai into existence was 0%,"" Watkins told CoinDesk. ""But later in the summer and early fall, Maker was able to raise interest rates, which led to MKR generating a lot of revenue.""      Denis Vinokourov, head of research at the London-based prime brokerage Bequant, said a recent approval of an executive vote to increase debt ceilings for a variety of vaults (where a user deposits collateral and generates dai) could have contributed to the price surge as well.      Analysts also said the rally was possibly triggered by the current bull market.      ""Recent excitement across the industry provided the recipe for [MKR's value] to finally be recognized,"" Watkins said.",POSITIVE,MKR,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MKR | TRADING | RESEARCH,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/01/06/makers-mkr-token-surges-to-2-year-high-on-defi-growth,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a6c438d3e99926151660d496cbed21f77eade861-1500x893.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $36,122 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 5.7% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $33,875-$36,122 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC well above its 10-hour and 50-hour moving averages on the hourly chart, a bullish signal for market technicians.    The price of bitcoin hit another all-time high Wednesday, jumping to $35,735 at 04:00 UTC (11 p.m. ET Tuesday), easily surpassing Jan. 2’s previous record high of $34,366.      Read More: Bitcoin Sets New All-Time High Above $35K      And then, after hitting that price zenith, the world’s oldest cryptocurrency settled around the $35,000 level for several hours before heading upward yet again, hitting $36,122 as of press time.      “With a lot of demand from new market participants, both institutional and retail, it is reasonable to assume that we keep going up,” said Michael Gord, chief executive officer of trading firm Global Digital Assets. “A $650 billion market cap is still tiny in comparison to other global currencies or commodities that bitcoin is competing with.”      “In addition to institutions continuing to push the market forward we are starting to see a surge of retail demand as well,” Gord added.      Many funds, including Pantera Capital, are identifying growth in retail demand via PayPal’s brokerage Paxos, which also owns the itBit exchange and provides liquidity. Since PayPal launched cryptocurrency capabilities for its users, itBit’s BTC volume numbers have increased significantly.      Since the Nov. 13 rollout of cryptocurrency services to all U.S. PayPal users, itBit’s average bitcoin daily volume has been $25.9 million. That’s much higher than the exchange’s comparatively paltry $5.3 million daily average over the past year, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      Of course, bitcoin isn’t the only cryptocurrency out there, and some exhaustion is expected as traders rotate into alternative digital assets, or altcoins, in hopes of capturing big-time gains.      “The altcoin market is becoming more appealing for traders and investors who are looking for large returns,” Jean Baptiste Pavageau, partner at quant trading firm ExoAlpha, told CoinDesk. “We expect to see bitcoin dominance starting to decrease and the altcoin market booming over the next few weeks.”      Indeed, bitcoin’s dominance, its percentage share of the overall crypto market, has dropped 4.6% since Jan. 3.      As traders jump into crypto assets with smaller market capitalizations, bitcoin may see a temporary cooling, according to Global Digital Asset Chief Operating Officer Zachary Friedman. “We should be seeing stronger hands [who don't sell easily], which may shorten the drawdown. But I wouldn’t be surprised to see a retrace of 20% before moving higher,” he said.    The heat is on ether options    The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH), was up Wednesday, trading around $1,206 and climbing 9.2% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      Ether derivatives, such as futures and options, are instruments traders are now clamoring for. On Deribit, the top venue for ether options, implied volatility, which is the forecast of an asset’s spot price movement, is 170%, according to data aggregator Genesis Volatility.      “These levels haven't been seen since the March [COVID-19] crisis,” said Greg Mandini, chief executive officer for Genesis Volatility. At that time, ether options' implied volatility surpassed 230%. The levels this week indicate traders are paying huge premiums to play in the ether options market.      Read More: UK’s Ban on Crypto Derivatives Goes Into Effect Today      “There is an undeniable FOMO for ETH exposure,” Mandini added. “Combine the effects of staking and CME's ETH future launch in February we can see strong incentives for institutional capital flowing into ETH.”    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are all green Wednesday.

The price of bitcoin soared to a new-all time high of $37,014.58, before settling back to $36,780.78, up 6.40% over the last 24 hours.  It continues a wild start to 2021 and follows a landmark year in which the cryptocurrency rose more than 300%, with an almost 50% gain in December alone. On Nov. 30, bitcoin breached a nearly three-year-old high of $19,793. By the close of Dec. 31, the cryptocurrency had risen about $10,000.  Five days into 2021, it's up 25.1%, more than $7,000.  The prevailing narrative of this record-setting run is a growing view that bitcoin represents a form of ""digital gold,"" a view that has brought a flood of institutional investors into the cryptocurrency.  Today's record, however, may have more to do with the storming of the U.S. Capitol by President Donald Trump's supporters believing the election was rigged and upset by the certification process that was underway, than with any inflation hedge.  Global macro uncertainty has the potential to devalue fiat currencies, which in turn could potentially increase the attractiveness of bitcoin. A disputed election followed by protestors breaking into the Capitol with at least one person being shot would seem to fall under the category of ""uncertainty.""

U.K.-based CoinCorner debuted Lightning Network support for its users Tuesday. They can now deposit and withdraw bitcoin with the secondary network, a software stack that is built on top of Bitcoin’s core technology which facilitates cheap and fast transactions.      “Lightning is the most decentralized and trustless scaling solution. We were always going to integrate Lightning but it was just a matter of timing and resource availability within the company,” Danny Scott, CEO of CoinCorner, told CoinDesk.    See also: What Is Bitcoin's Lightning Networks?  Bitcoin’s Lightning Network meets another exchange    CoinCorner introduced the payment method to its payment gateway, CoinCorner Checkout, in April of last year, Scott said. This made the integration for the exchange easy, a two-week endeavor, Scott said.      “Granted, myself and Zakk Lakin, our tech lead, have been playing around with Lightning nodes for the last few years, so we have a strong understanding of how it works,” Scott qualified.      Lightning Network deposits and on-chain deposits will show up as the same balance for CoinCorner users, Scott said. He added the exchange plans to roll out a feature that will allow them to pay Lightning Network invoices from their GBP wallet on the exchange, something akin to Zap’s Strike, a Lightning-powered “Venmo” that announced its global release today.      Lightning is currently only available for CoinCorner’s website but Scott said a mobile version will be coming soon.    2021: The year of Lightning?    CoinCorner’s working support for the network comes after crypto exchange Kraken pledged last December to integrate Lightning in 2021. Besides CoinCorner, Bitfinex and River Financial are the only popular cryptocurrency exchanges that have live support for the Lightning Network.      Launched in 2018, Bitcoin’s Lightning Network saw a number of upgrades in the tail end of 2019 and throughout 2020 that have improved its financial plumbing. Most notably, it added multi-part (aka multi-path) payments and wumbo channels, which, respectively, improve how Lightning sends payments and how much bitcoin can be sent through the network.    See also: ‘Rat Poison Squared on Steroids’: What’s New in Bitcoin’s Latest Lightning Release    These improvements to the Lightning network “have certainly made it more attractive for exchanges to begin introducing it to help with larger and more reliable transactions,” Scott said.      “I think every exchange has Lightning on their radar. It's just a case of resources and internal company priority as to when this is integrated. If exchanges are running their own wallet infrastructure, then adding the Lightning infrastructure is simpler than people are making out,” he continued.      The network is still young and not without its shortcomings, but it is growing. Per data from Bitcoin Visuals the number of public bitcoin nodes connected to the Lightning Network has grown nearly two fold this year to roughly 8,300 nodes.

42405637,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAedkYr,1609958463,The Future of Cryptographic Security in the Age of Quantum,"Modern cryptography is still a relatively young scientific discipline, but its history shows a significant pattern. Most developments are based on research that took place years or even decades before. There’s a good reason for this glacial pace of movement. Just as drugs and vaccines undergo years of rigorous testing before they reach the market, cryptography applications must be based on proven and thoroughly analyzed methods.      Blockchain is one such example of the development cycle in action. Satoshi Nakamoto’s work on Bitcoin was the application of principles first described by David Chaum in the early 1980s. Similarly, recent deployments of multiparty computation (MPC) for securing private keys or sealed-bid auctions make use of ideas developed around the same time. Now, as the threat of quantum machines looms over modern computers, the need for newer and stronger forms of cryptography has never been greater.    Torben Pryds Pedersen is chief technology officer of Concordium and was previously head of Cryptomathic’s R&D division.    Nobody knows precisely when or if quantum computers will prove capable of cracking today’s encryption methods. However, the threat alone currently drives extensive work in developing alternatives that will prove robust enough to withstand a quantum attack.    A compressed timeline    Finding a replacement for existing encryption methods isn’t a trivial task. For the past three years, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has worked to research and advance alternative algorithms, or the backbone of any cryptographic system. This July, it announced a shortlist of 15 proposals in an ongoing project looking for quantum-resistant encryption standards..      But many of these proposals are unattractive due to unworkable key sizes or overall efficiency. What’s more, these alternatives must undergo sufficient testing and scrutiny to ensure they withstand the test of time.      I’m sure we’ll see further developments in this area. However, the development of better cryptographic algorithms is only one piece of the puzzle. Once an alternative is defined, there’s a much bigger job in ensuring that all existing applications get updated to the new standard. The scope of this is massive, covering virtually every use case on the entire internet, across all of finance and in blockchains.      See also: What Google’s ‘Quantum Supremacy’ Means for the Future of Cryptocurrency      Given the scale of the task, plans and measures to migrate existing data must be in place long before the quantum threat becomes a reality.    Digital signatures for self-sovereign data    Governments and banking institutions are not naive. According to the 2020 UN E-Government Survey, 65% of member governments are thinking seriously about governance in the digital age, according to the agency’s own metrics. Personal data privacy is a growing concern, reflected by the inclusion of data protection mechanisms and methods for digital signatures on the development agenda for e-government applications.      The technology behind digital signatures is generally well-understood by governments. For example, in Europe, the eIDAS regulation puts a responsibility on organizations in member states to implement unified standards for electronic signatures, qualified digital certificates and other authentication mechanisms for electronic transactions. However, there’s also a recognition on the part of the European Union that updates will be required to protect against the quantum computer threat.      It seems likely that future methods for protecting personal data will be steered by the principle that users own their own data. In the banking world PSD2, a payments directive for how financial institutions treat data, has been a catalyst for this principle. Once users hold the rights to share their own data, it becomes easier to facilitate data sharing across multiple banking institutions.      Cryptography plays a significant role in the principle of self-sovereign data today, but I believe we will see this concept become more prevalent in Web 3.0 applications. Ideally, users will control their data across any Web 3.0 application, providing full interoperability and ease of use.    Enhancing security and trustlessness with multi-party computation    Similar to the rise of digital signatures, there will be more applications of multiparty computation. From being a purely theoretic construction 30 years ago, we now see MPC applied in more real-world use cases. For example, several institutional-grade asset security platforms, including Unbound Tech, Sepior, Curv and Fireblocks, are already using variations of MPC to keep private keys secure.    Blockchains have yet to fulfill their true potential, evidenced by the lack of compelling use cases.    Due to the vast security potential of MPC, we will continue to see improvements in this technology. It also fits well with the principles of decentralizing trust, given it removes single points of attack and reduces dependency on single trusted entities. In the future, a single individual’s private key could be stored in multiple decentralized locations, but still deployed instantly when the user demands.    Blockchains for individuals and enterprises    Blockchain technology is still in a low state of maturity. It theoretically offers significant promise to help individuals and enterprises gain control over their data. But the fact remains today’s blockchains and related distributed ledger technologies have yet to fulfill their true potential, evidenced by the lack of compelling use cases.      However, in light of the evolution of other usages of cryptography, such as digital signatures and multiparty computation, it’s reasonable to expect blockchain technology will improve significantly, become more efficient and accessible – and therefore gain more traction in the coming years.      The concept of blockchains is not in itself threatened by quantum computers. Blockchains are, first of all, used to securely register data (or digests of data) and we know already now how to secure the basic functionality of blockchains (immutability of registered data) with cryptographic primitives that are secure in the quantum era (hash functions and digital signature schemes).      But more work is required to handle more advanced protocols in an efficient way and more work is needed to continuously improve the security and efficiency of cryptographic primitives to make the blockchain more and more efficient.      In light of this, we will see a gradual improvement of distributed systems so that they remain secure. We will probably like to keep the smart and good properties of the current cryptographic algorithms and gradually update these as necessary.

A lack of usability has been a massive problem for most cryptography applications so far – and this is also true for blockchains. Most platforms are simply infrastructural solutions and, as such, involve a high degree of friction for end users.

42405642,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAedkel,1609958022,This Elusive Malware Has Been Targeting Crypto Wallets for a Year,"Operating for a year now, insidious malware ElectroRAT is bringing 2020 into 2021 and targeting crypto wallets.      A researcher at cybersecurity firm Intezer has identified and documented the inner workings of ElectroRAT, which has been targeting and draining victims’ funds.      According to the researcher, Avigayil Mechtinger, the malware operation includes a variety of detailed tools that dupes victims, including a “marketing campaign, custom cryptocurrency-related applications and a new Remote Access Tool (RAT) written from scratch.”      The malware is called ElectroRAT because it’s a remote access tool that was embedded in apps built on Electron, an app-building platform. Hence, ElectroRAT.      “It's unsurprising to see novel malware being published, especially during a bull market in which the value of cryptocurrency is shooting up and making such attacks more profitable,” said Jameson Lopp, chief technology officer (CTO) at crypto custody startup Casa.      Over the past few months, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have entered a bull market, seeing prices skyrocket across the industry.    See also: New to Bitcoin? Stay Safe and Avoid These Common Scams  What is ElectroRAT?    ElectroRat malware is written in the open-source programming language Golang, which is good for cross-platform functionality and is targeted at multiple operating systems, including macOS, Linux, and Windows.      As part of the malware operation, the attackers set up “domain registrations, websites, trojanized applications and fake social media accounts,” according to the report.      In the report, Mechtinger notes that while attackers commonly try to collect private keys used to access people’s wallets, seeing original tools like ElectroRAT and the various apps written “from scratch” and targeting multiple operating systems is quite rare.      “Writing the malware from scratch has also allowed the campaign to fly under the radar for almost a year by evading all antivirus detections,” wrote Mechtinger in the report.      Lopp echoed these comments, and said it’s particularly interesting the malware is being compiled for and targeting all three major operating systems.      “The value majority of malware tends to be Windows-only due to the wide install base and the weaker security of the operating system,” said Lopp. “In the case of bitcoin, malware authors may reason that a lot of early adopters are more technical people who run Linux.”    How it works    To lure in victims, the ElectroRat attackers created three different domains and apps operating on multiple operating systems.      The pages to download the apps were created specifically for this operation and designed to look like legitimate entities.      The associated apps specifically appeal to and target cryptocurrency users. “Jamm” and “eTrade” are trade management apps; “DaoPoker” is a poker app that uses cryptocurrency.      Using fake social media and user profiles, as well as paying a social media influencer for their advertising, the attacker pumped the apps, including promoting them in targeted cryptocurrency and blockchain forums like bitcointalk and SteemCoinPan. The posts encouraged readers to look at the professional-looking websites and download the apps when, in reality, they were also downloading the malware.      For example, the DaoPoker Twitter page had 417 followers while a social media advertiser with over 25,000 followers on Twitter promoted eTrade. As of writing, the DaoPoker twitter page is still live.      While the apps look legitimate at first glance on the front end, they are running nefarious background activities, targeting users' cryptocurrency wallets. They are also still active.    See also: ‘Convincing’ Phishing Attack Targets Ledger Hardware Wallet Users    “Hackers want to get your cryptocurrency, and they are willing to go far with it – spend months of work to create fake companies, fake reputation and innocent-looking applications that hide malware to steal your coins,” said Mechtinger.    What it does    “ElectroRAT has various capabilities,” said Mechtinger in an email. “It can take screenshots, key logs, upload folders/files from a victim's machine and more. Upon execution, it establishes commands with its command-and control-server and waits for commands.”      The report suggests the malware specifically targets cryptocurrency users for the purpose of attacking their crypto wallets, noting that victims were observed commenting on posts related to the popular Ethereum wallet app Metamask. Based on the researchers’ observations of the malware’s behaviors, it’s possible more than 6.5 thousand people had been compromised.    How to avoid it    The first step is the best step and that’s not to download any of these apps, full stop.      In general, when you’re looking into new apps, Lopp suggests avoiding shady websites and forums. Only install software that is well-known and properly reviewed; look for apps with lengthy reputation histories and sizable install bases.      “Don't use wallets that store the private keys on your laptop/desktop; private keys should be stored on dedicated hardware devices,” said Lopp.    See also: How to Store Your Bitcoin    This point reinforces the importance of storing your crypto in cold hardware wallets and writing down seed phrases rather than just storing them on your computer. Both of these techniques make them inaccessible to malware that trolls your online activity.      There are secondary steps that can be taken if you think your computer might have already been compromised.      “To make sure you are not infected we recommend [you] take proactive action and scan your devices for malicious activity,” said Mechtinger.      In the report, Mechtinger suggests that if you think you’re a victim of this scam, you need to kill the processes running and delete all files related to the malware. You also need to make sure your machine is clean and running non-malicious code. Intezer has created Endpoint Scanner for Windows environments and Intezer Protect, a free community tool for Linux users. More detailed information about detection can be found in the original report.      And, of course, you should move your funds to a new crypto wallet and change all your passwords.    A higher bitcoin price attracts more malware    With the price of bitcoin continuing to rise, Mechtinger doesn’t see attacks like this slowing down. In fact, they’re likely to increase.      “There are high capitals at stake, which is classic for financially motivated hackers,” she said.      Lopp said we will see attackers devote greater and greater resources to coming up with new ways to part people from their private keys.      “While a novel attack takes much greater effort to develop, the rewards are also potentially higher because it's more likely to fool people because the knowledge of that style of attack has not been disseminated through the user base,” he said. “That is, people are more likely to expose themselves to the attack unknowingly.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | WALLET,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/01/06/this-elusive-malware-has-been-targeting-crypto-wallets-for-a-year,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/831c61edbc6fd9d47f34eb8d8fefd8612c13ccfa-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

At stake    Rippled suits? In Matt Levine’s much-awaited return to his opinion-heavy Bloomberg newsletter, Money Stuff, the financial columnist wrote about the effects of securities fraud action on business environments. In the U.S., he writes, there’s a growing trend that “everything is securities fraud.” Making a bad video game that causes a gaming studio’s stock to drop: securities fraud. Harboring a culture of harassment: securities fraud. Playing up a news release for something insignificant: securities fraud.      Though Levine’s headline calls it a “dystopian future,” his conclusion is a bit more positive. A culture where smart lawyers can find restitution for stockholders affected by negative performance is a “general” way to keep publicly traded firms from doing generically bad things, even if they are not affected by these actions in principle.      “Everything is securities fraud, even things that aren’t actually illegal; anything that gets bad press or moral disapprobation can lead to a securities lawsuit. It is in its way an oddly principles-based form of regulation: You don’t need specific rules against specific types of bad conduct; all you need is evidence that the company did a thing and the stock dropped because of it,” Levine concludes.      There aren’t many publicly traded companies in the crypto industry this trend might apply to, though the attitude – of pursuing legal action for any perceived or real financial loss – still pervades.      Yesterday, one of Ripple Labs’ biggest financial backers filed suit against the crypto incumbent to redeem its investment. Back in 2019, the multi-billion asset manager Tetragon Financial Group led Ripple’s $200 million Series C.      And now that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating Ripple for potential securities fraud, Tetragon wants its cash back. Filed in Delaware, Tetragon said it will attempt to “enforce its contractual right to require Ripple to redeem” its preferred stock, Bloomberg reported, and even freeze Ripple’s assets until it pays up.      Ripple rejected the lawsuit, saying its investor can only redeem its equity for cash “if XRP is deemed to be a security on a go-forward basis,” according to a court filing.      While Tetragon isn’t claiming securities fraud on behalf of Ripple, it is an effect of an ongoing securities fraud investigation. The SEC claims Ripple raised $1.3 billion over a seven-year period by selling XRP to retail investors. Ripple is the primary holder of XRP, though it has claimed over the years the network is sufficiently decentralized like Ethereum and that it is not the crypto’s creator.      Whether XRP is a security is now up for the courts to decide, but the lawsuit has already led to material outcomes. Grayscale Investments (sister company to CoinDesk) and Bitwise both removed XRP from their crypto index funds, while several exchanges have made moves to delist or suspend XRP trading.      One might wonder if XRP is deemed to be a security and Ripple found to have violated securities law, if exchanges might have the right to pursue legal action against the firm. Because, as Levine points out, litigiousness is baked into U.S. business culture.

42405625,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAedkO2,1609952405,"Bitcoin Lightning Startup Zap Goes Global, Adding Multiple Fiat Pairs, Stablecoins","Bitcoin’s Lightning Network is bringing fiat to every corner of the world, thanks to Visa-partnered startup Zap Inc.      Strike – the Chicago-based startup’s Bitcoin wallet and banking service – is rolling out native support for the euro, pound and Swiss franc, soon to be followed by the Australian and Canadian dollar after partnering with cryptocurrency exchange Bittrex Global, according to Zap founder Jack Mallers in a phone interview with CoinDesk.      Described by Mallers, as a “Bitcoin neo-bank,” Strike leverages the Bitcoin network and scaling technology the Lightning Network to move fiat fast from point A to point B. Zap plans on providing banking services in up to 200 countries via the international exchange.      “We can move any physical value anywhere in the world for no variable cost,” Mallers said. “Transaction finality from one point to another for free.”      Moreover, Strike will also list popular stablecoins tether and USD coin (USDC), beginning with a pilot program in El Salvador. Stablecoins were one of the crypto industry’s breakout products in 2020. The market cap of dollar-pegged tokens rose some from around $7 billion to over $30 billion by the year's end, according to Messari.      Read more: US Federal Regulator Says Banks Can Conduct Payments Using Stablecoins      Mallers said Bittrex Global will handle the behind-the-scenes operations with the tokens, which typically are issued on the Ethereum blockchain. Strike itself does not support ether or Ethereum-based tokens. Rather, each tether or USDC token is credited to an account on Bittrex and mirrored on Strike’s internal database, he said.      “Leveraging Bittrex Global’s technology, Strike users will be able to seamlessly send and receive payments using both fiat money and cryptocurrencies,” CEO of Bittrex Global Tom Albright said in an email to CoinDesk. “This will allow billions of people around the world to access the financial system in a simple low-cost way, fulfilling the original vision and promise of Bitcoin.”      Mallers chose El Salvador to pilot the stablecoin project because of its large availability of dollars, Bitcoin ATMs and one of the largest remittance markets in the world. The Latin American nation swapped out its native currency, the colon, in the early 2000s for the greenback. At the time, El Salvador was trying to stimulate economic activity by adopting the stronger currency in a case of intentional “dollarization.”      South American neighbor Venezuela is next on the list, he added, with more stablecoin case studies on the way.    How Strike works    Strike moves fiat by buying and selling bitcoin in real time over the Lightning Network – an experimental scaling solution built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain.      To explain the process, the 26-year-old CEO used the example of shopping for one of his signature fashion choices. If you want to send money to a Berlin hoodie designer from the United States, Mallers explained, Strike will first auto-convert fiat into bitcoin. That bitcoin is then sent to a Strike Lightning node residing in the jurisdiction of the other currency. An auto-conversion between bitcoin and euros finishes up the transaction and deposits fiat in the Strike app, Mallers said.      Read more: What is Bitcoin's Lightning Network?      This money maneuver has two results, Mallers said. First, fees are so low you can customize how and when you pay, even down to the minute (as he pays one Spain-residing Strike employee). Second, Mallers argues that the exchange of two fiat currencies through a permissionless intermediary like Bitcoin creates a “true” foreign exchange rate.      Mallers’ startup is working with two yet-to-be named banking providers on the venture. He declined to comment on the subject. Zap has also deployed an unspecified number of Bitcoin and Lightning nodes throughout the globe to support the project.      As reported by CoinDesk, Zap joined Visa’s Fast Track program in 2020. Capitalizing on the Visa partnership, Strike is rolling out its own debit card in the U.S. and EU in Q1 and Q2 respectively, Mallers said. The same instant and feeless experience exists with the card.      The startup joins a number of other crypto firms, such as Fold, to launch cards with the Visa network.      The Bittrex Global partnership follows the release of Strike’s newest payroll feature that already lists professional athlete and Bitcoin advocate Russell Okung and unnamed players on the New York Yankees and Brooklyn Nets, not to mention Billboard Top 100 artists.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/01/06/bitcoin-lightning-startup-zap-goes-global-adding-multiple-fiat-pairs-stablecoins,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/517f7253bd981eb2f227e56c3e67f48064230c06-1400x1050.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405606,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAediod,1609950672,What Does It Cost to Become an FCA-Approved Exchange? EXMO Execs Explain,"The day after the U.K.-based EXMO crypto exchange was hacked last month, reportedly losing 6% of its crypto assets, the team got a call from the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).      The FCA recently put the exchange on the list for temporary registration and wanted to know what EXMO, an exchange with $117 million in daily volume, according to CoinGecko, was going to do to prevent such incidents in the future, the exchange’s COO Sergey Zhdanov told CoinDesk, providing rare details about how exchanges address regulatory requirements in the U.K.      The country has been a jurisdiction of choice for many crypto startups. “The U.K. has always been a strong hub for financial companies, whether they are crypto or not. The regulatory framework, unlike other countries, for crypto has gradually started to become clearer and I feel this clarity is what companies are really searching for,” Iqbal V. Gandham, former managing director of eToro in London, told CoinDesk.      Last year, the country got serious about taking control of the crypto industry. This past summer, the FCA told cryptocurrency service providers they needed to register to keep operating in the U.K..      Since then, multiple applications have flowed in, prompting the agency to introduce a temporary registration regime for the companies it wouldn’t be able to vet before the Dec. 16, 2020, deadline. So far, only four companies have obtained the full registration, including the Winklevoss brothers’ Gemini exchange.      The list of 95 companies that received temporary authorization includes exchanges Bitstamp, Coinfloor and eToro, and infrastructure players Fidelity Digital Assets, Galaxy Digital, among others. EXMO, a smaller crypto exchange with a largely Russian and Ukrainian team, was on the list, too.      Instead of waiting around for cats to herd themselves, the FCA reached out to the companies, which is why last January the agency contacted EXMO to remind the exchange that new regulations were coming, Zhdanov said.      “They said: ‘We’re monitoring all the crypto exchanges and wanted to make sure you know that you should be doing user verification. I was surprised that they contacted exchanges themselves,” he added.    How it started    EXMO was launched in 2014 by a team of Russian crypto enthusiasts headed by then-real estate developer Ivan Petukhovsky. “If I knew back then how challenging it [the business] would be, I probably wouldn’t even have started it,” he told CoinDesk over a call.      Even though the team initially was located in Thailand, where Petuknovsky’s real estate business was located, EXMO chose to register its headquarters in the U.K.      “Back then, nobody understood if a legal entity [for a crypto business] was needed and if it was important at all,” Zhdanov said. “But after mid-2017, after the [initial coin offerings], all the banks turned away from crypto and we realized that a legal entity was very important.”      Getting a bank account is a problem for the crypto industry; even now, only a handful of banks are serving crypto businesses, Zhdanov said. It didn’t matter that much at the dawn of the crypto industry, in 2016 and earlier, he added. Back then, partnering with payment processors was enough to provide small crypto purchases, while for large amounts of crypto people would often just pay the over-the-counter brokers with cash.      But as crypto got more attention, the need for a bank account became more urgent.      Things got slightly better over time, but not a whole lot. “In 2018, we got a lot of rejections from banks,” Zhdanov said. “Back then, 90% of banks would refuse to work with crypto. Now, it’s probably 80%.”      The other 20% or so apply strict compliance rules, he added. In Europe, as the industry is getting more regulated it’s getting a bit easier.      But even having a legal entity does not guarantee a bank would serve you, Zhdanov said. At first, EXMO got an Estonian license – one of the first registration formats for crypto businesses in the world. But that did not open the doors of banks for EXMO, Zhdanov said. Only in early 2020 did the exchange get an account with Lichtenstein’s Friсk Bank.    How it’s going    Since last year, stricter anti-money laundering (AML) rules, under the so-called AML5 directive, came into force across Europe. EXMO introduced obligatory authentication for users. Users did not like it, Zhdanov said: About 10% of EXMO’s clients left immediately. “Someone just didn’t want to get verified, someone tried, got an error and didn’t want to try again,” Zhdanov said.      However, all the big traders stayed on the platform because they had already been verified, he noted. Verification gives more control, so if an account gets compromised a verified user can ask the exchange to stop a withdrawal transaction by proving an intruder is trying to get money out.      Now, with the registration and more regulatory requirements, the compliance team of EXMO was nearly doubled, to 26 people. Overall income fell 10%, Zhdanov said, both because of the users' outflow and the new costs of more compliance officers, new software for transaction-tracing and keeping up with sanction lists.      EXMO is relying on the outsourced contractors located in Russia and Ukraine for tech support. FCA appeared to be interested in why the workforce is located in these “high-risk” countries, Zhdanov said. The explanation that it’s more “cost efficient” worked, he added.      To users in such countries, the exchange is applying an “enhanced due diligence,” Zhdanov said. EXMO is especially popular among Russian-speaking traders, and the majority of users come from Russia, Ukraine and Belarus.      However, the FCA only wanted to know how many U.K. users EXMO serves. Britain is the fourth-largest jurisdiction for EXMO in terms of users, Zhdanov said, with 500 monthly active users. “I think [FCA] needed to make sure you are working with the U.K. market at all, so they don’t have to regulate companies that aren’t even doing business here,” Petukhovsky said.      Another question was how many people are using EXMO, but there is a catch: How do you define a “user""? Someone who registered on a platform? Someone who has a deposit in an account? Someone who did at least one trade? These can be different numbers, the EXMO team said. They ended up counting how many users made at least one trade over the past year, Zhdanov said. That turned out to be 400,000 users.      The FCA asked how many of those were verified, and why not all. The team explained that some people had been trading but didn’t try to withdraw money from their accounts, so for the time being there was no risk associated with such users and no need to verify them. The FCA seemed to accept the logic because it hasn’t asked about this anymore, Zhdanov said. The agency also requested a sample of cases for users blocked for AML reasons, with the detailed reports.      Overall, despite the burden of the new regulation, FCA’s approach seems reasonable so far, Zhdanov said: “Their job is to protect users. That’s what is shaping their interaction with us.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/01/06/what-does-it-cost-to-become-an-fca-approved-exchange-exmo-execs-explain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b6db8cd206ec3786ffaf00fd353af905e9c39f27-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A third of that amount is in ether, roughly more than 300,000 ETH, according to a spokesperson from the San Francisco-based crypto exchange. Other popular cryptocurrencies on Kraken’s staking services include tezos (XTZ) and polkadot (DOT).      Kraken's users have staked about 58 million DOT (approximately $580,000,000) and 45.5 million XTZ tokens (about $22,500,000), according to data provided by Kraken.      The fast growth of the staking value reflects the many long positions of investors and traders in cryptocurrencies, according to Jeremy Welch, Kraken’s vice president of product.      ""Staking's popularity is the natural outcome of an asset class growing in maturity,"" Welch told CoinDesk. ""Whereas three years ago holders were mainly interested in securing short-term gains, many are now confident locking up tokens to earn passive income. Why? Conviction is growing in the longevity of crypto assets as a respectable new asset class.""      Kraken also provides staking services for five other cryptocurrencies, including kava (KAVA) and cosmos (ATOM), with yearly rewards varying between 0.25% and 20%.      ""Staking"" refers to locking up one’s cryptocurrencies to receive rewards for participating in transaction validation on a proof-of-stake blockchain. Many crypto exchanges offer staking services so users do not have to stake their coins directly from their wallets.      Kraken started providing the Ethereum 2.0 staking service on Dec. 3. It warned its users in a blog post at the time that staking is mostly for “long-term ether holders” because “staking ether cannot be unstaked and, along with staking rewards, cannot be transferred for an unknown period of time.”      The total amount of ether locked in Ethereum 2.0 has recently surpassed $2.58 billion, less than a month since ether's value broke the $1 billion landmark, according to data from Etherscan. As of press time, ether was trading at $1,145.22, a gain of 8.55% in 24 hours. It is close to its all-time high at $1,448.18, according to CoinDesk 20 data.

42405617,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAedj0R,1609944374,Enterprise Blockchain Is at a Private-Public Crossroads,"Looking back 12 months, our (Prysm's) review of 2019 was naive, to say the least. We cited challenges to a successful 2020 for enterprise blockchain. And, while those predictions were not far off, they were overshadowed by a global shore-up of innovation budgeting, a mountain of layoffs and just about every other form of disaster that might get in the way of a technology revolution.      To say that 2020 was a complete miss for enterprise blockchain would not be accurate. A few new networks and major corporate initiatives were announced, including PharmaLedger, Dole and a group of major Japanese maintenance companies, the Japanese government and IOTA.    Guido Molinari is the managing partner at Prysm Group, an economic advisory focused on the implementation of emerging technologies. He is a member of the Economic Advisory Committee at the Algorand Foundation and a Fellow at the Royal Society of Arts. This post is part of CoinDesk's 2020 Year in Review – a collection of op-eds, essays and interviews about the year in crypto and beyond.    But many of these projects barely grew. According to Prysm Group internal data dating back to 2016, the average enterprise blockchain consortium has gained less than one new participant beyond its founding members. There are a few outliers such as Italy’s banking network Spunta. But, for an industry whose primary purpose is to build a network adopted by other future members, this is not an encouraging figure.      2020 may have just accelerated a preexisting trajectory.      Over the last year we have seen consulting firms, technology providers and large cloud players look to better define their strategies for enterprise blockchain in hopes of trying to push the industry past the trough of disillusionment. In 2021, we see major firms at a crossroads between a private versus public approach for enterprise blockchain.      There are key differences in the way major players seek to establish themselves on the private versus public spectrum. As you can see from our chart here, some are betting on a single protocol, some are spreading their bets. The variety of strategies raises the question of who, if anyone, will be the best positioned for 2021?      Most major firms sit on the private end of the strategic spectrum. In the single protocol top left quadrant, we see dominant players such as IBM and R3 with their respective commitments to Hyperledger Fabric and Corda. IBM has seen some internal shifts and a realignment of its blockchain strategy with its cloud offering. R3 has unveiled a series of major partnerships over the year, first with ConsenSys spin-off Kaleido and then with IBM itself.      A third major player, ConsenSys, remains fully supportive of Ethereum, and with the acquisition of Quorum from JPMorgan it has cemented its position in enterprise offering. It now looks well-positioned to be involved in all initiatives surrounding the number two public blockchain network.      In the protocol agnostic bottom left quadrant, Salesforce remains focused on private initiatives for its 150,000 clients and Accenture now has alliances across the full spectrum of available private chains. This has allowed the consulting firm to spread its bets across several competing platforms and hedge against any potential losers.    Does that signal that a public approach will champion? We think that is likely going to be the case in the long run.    Deloitte, PwC and KPMG have focused primarily on building proof-of-concepts on private chains for their clients and they have yet to showcase a consortium in full production.      Amazon Web Services (AWS) has taken a user-friendly approach, allowing clients to easily launch networks on Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum with just a few clicks. While AWS has announced some initial customers with appealing use cases like Legal & General in the reinsurance business and Nestle in supply chain tracking, it has yet to show a multi-party consortium coming together, which will be needed in order to capture the economic value of this network based technology.      Others firms are embracing the public path at the crossroads, like EY with its now full commitment to public Ethereum. EY hopes the network started by Vitalik Buterin, now shifting towards its new proof-of-stake consensus model, will be able to scale and lower its transaction costs, two key hurdles that will need to be overcome in order to position the platform to become the bedrock of potentially billions of enterprise transactions.      Google has kept a mostly behind-the-scenes role with a series of public networks announcing throughout the year the Mountain View, Calif., company joining their networks as a governing council member, validator or block producer.      See also: Stephanie Hurder - Why Enterprise Blockchains Fail: No Economic Incentives      Thinking about the crossroads we are at for enterprise blockchain, the burning question is, who will win? Is it winner take all? Probably not. But one would guess there will be losers as well as winners. And with blockchain technology expected to generate $1.7 trillion in economic value in the next decade, these firms will be working to push forward their approach in attempts of grabbing a piece of that trillion-dollar pie.      As uncertainties remain of even what will take place tomorrow in the world of blockchain, it is near impossible to predict how the future will shape up in the year to come. But by looking at the history of internet development perhaps we can find some clues.      We know from this past that it was a single open internet built on the TCP/IP protocol that pushed aside many early attempts of closed networks and went on to dominate. Looking to the right-side quadrants of our chart, does that signal a public approach will win? We think that is likely going to be the case in the long run.      See also: Paul Brody - Public Blockchains Are Set to Reshape Global Commerce      We also know that rather than interoperability of many different systems, one system went on to command the market. If it is one protocol to rule them all, then is it ConsenSys' and EY’s bet on Ethereum that will pay off? If we accept their designation of the largest public network (after Bitcoin) as the TCP/IP of internet 3.0, then perhaps yes, and surely they would be well-positioned to capture the largest slice of the coveted internet of value pie.      Based on our experience working with many of the firms making these decisions, the signals seem to indicate that enterprise networks will, over time, transition to a winning open blockchain network. Looking back to our 2019 review, I remain convinced that demonstrating value, putting in place the right incentives design and an early, adaptable governance will be the three key components to take them there.

42405622,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAedj4N,1609943573,First Mover: Bitcoin Hits Record as 'Blue Wave' and 'Kimchi Premium' Look Bullish,"Bitcoin (BTC) rose for a second day, surging to a new all-time high price of $35,751, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.      The jump came as votes were tallied from Tuesday's special U.S. Senate runoff elections in the state of Georgia, where Democrats appeared on the cusp of gaining two seats that would deliver President-elect Joe Biden's party the upper legislative chamber and full control of Congress. A big loser in Georgia was U.S. Senator Kelly Loeffler, a former CEO of the Bakkt cryptocurrency exchange.      A Democratic win in the other Senate runoff election, which is where the votes were leaning early Wednesday, would usher in the ""Blue Wave"" scenario that cryptocurrency traders have been speculating over for months. Biden has pledged to increase government spending, which could lead to higher inflation as well as additional bond purchases (money printing) from the Federal Reserve.      Bitcoin is viewed as a potential hedge against currency debasement by a growing number of investors in both digital-asset markets and on Wall Street.      ""We have to expect fiscal policy to be looser than if Republicans had kept their majority,"" Ian Shepherdson, chief economist with the forecasting firm Pantheon, wrote early Wednesday in a note to clients.      In traditional markets, Asian and European shares rose and U.S. stock futures pointed to a higher open.      U.S. 10-year Treasury bond yields have climbed above 1% for the first time since March, potentially on expectation of increased borrowing by the American government. U.S. crude oil futures rose above $50 a barrel as Saudi Arabia agreed to a unilateral production cut of 1 million barrels a day.    Market moves    First Mover has written extensively about bitcoin's embrace by U.S. institutional investors, beginning in earnest last year, as a hedge against currency debasement in the face of trillions of dollars of fiscal and monetary stimulus from governments and central banks around the world.      But a story published Tuesday by CoinDesk's Muyao Shen offers a reminder that the appetite for bitcoin is also strong among retail buyers, and is geographically diversified.      According to Shen, what's known in cryptocurrency circles as the ""kimchi premium"" has returned – seen as a sign of surging interest in bitcoin from retail buyers in South Korea.      The kimchi premium is the extra price margin over global bitcoin prices that is sometimes witnessed on Korean cryptocurrency exchanges. It's named for the popular Korean pickled side dish.      And the premium has hit a two-year high, as quantified by the difference in prices on South Korean’s Upbit exchange and Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange. The kimchi premium recently hit 4.15%, according to real-time exchange data-tracking site scolkg.com, the biggest mark-up since early 2018.      The kimchi premium first appeared in early 2016, according to researchers at the University of Calgary. Between January 2016 and February 2018, it averaged at 4.73% and reached its highest at 54.48% in January 2018.      Jason Kim, chief investment officer of the Tokyo-headquartered investment firm Anchor Value, says there's a lack of institutional traders in South Korea’s crypto market, which elevates the prominence of retail customers in the country who use exchanges more frequently and tend to follow “fear of missing out” trends during bull runs.      “Korean retailers are entering the market after seeing a strong price increase of bitcoin,” Sinhae Lee, partner of Shanghai-based blockchain consulting firm Block72, told CoinDesk.      With bitcoin prices up 20% already in 2021, after quadrupling in 2020 and doubling in 2019, the kimchi premium shows that the fear of missing out, often known by the acronym FOMO, might be global and broad-based.      Read more: Bitcoin Retail FOMO Brings a Heap of ‘Kimchi Premium’ to S. Korea    Bitcoin watch    Bitcoin, often touted as digital gold, jumped to fresh record highs early Wednesday alongside an uptick in longer-duration U.S. Treasury-bond yields, potentially a sign of looming inflation, according to one expert.      The cryptocurrency printed a new all-time high of $35,751 and the yield on 10-year Treasurys crossed above 1% for the first time since March 2020, according to data provider TradingView. While there is no direct correlation between the two assets, they're both increasingly linked to investor views on inflation, according to Chris Thomas, head of digital assets at Swissquote Bank.      Bond markets are often the first to price in expectations of inflation and interest rates.      ""The latest rise in yields could be an indication that interest rates may need to rise slightly in the future because the economy is in better shape, and to help control inflation,"" Thomas told CoinDesk. ""Naturally, if we think there is inflation, then the U.S. dollar will weaken, and all assets priced in USD will naturally strengthen.""      The dollar index, which tracks the greenback's value against majors, has declined to a fresh 33-month low of 89.25. However, the oversold currency could draw bids if the ascent in Treasury yields gathers pace, since investors might begin to see value in the higher income stream. In that case, bitcoin may have a tough time maintaining its bullish momentum.

42405612,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAediwV,1609942800,ShapeShift Is Going Full DeFi to Lose KYC Rules,"ShapeShift is swapping business structures again, this time by getting rid of its entire trading desk.      The Colorado-based non-custodial exchange is now routing orders through decentralized finance (DeFi) applications in a bid to get rid of know-your-customer (KYC) regulations that gutted the cryptocurrency trading platform back in 2018.      The firm will gradually phase out its own centralized trading activity (and KYC policy) in favor of a decentralized alternative as it becomes “100% DEX-based for customers,” ShapeShift founder and CEO Erik Voorhees told CoinDesk in an email.    See also: What Is DeFi    “ShapeShift’s original model was designed to protect users, providing instant liquidity without requiring them to trust a custodian,” Voorhees said. “We had to be the counterparty – the market maker – to provide that service at scale. The decentralized protocols are now providing a superior service, so we’re embracing this evolution and helping our customers easily connect with them.”    From KYC to DeFi    Founded in 2014, ShapeShift added a KYC requirement to its exchange in September 2018 following “duress” from regulators. Usually regarded as a vocal libertarian, Voorhees said at the time that ShapeShift added the restrictions as “a proactive step … to de-risk the company amid uncertain and changing global regulations.”      Voorhees later said KYC implementation cost the platform 95% of its users.    See also: Crypto Exchange ShapeShift Is Moving Away From Its No-Account Model    Two years later the exchange has now integrated with multiple decentralized exchanges (DEX) including “Uniswap, Balancer, Curve, Bancor, Kyber, 0x, mStable and half a dozen other DEXs,” Voorhees said. According to DeFi Pulse, DeFi applications currently hold some $17.86 billion.      Bitcoin (BTC) will be available for trading via the DEX integration this quarter, he said. Cryptocurrencies and tokens from other non-Ethereum blockchains will also be available in Q1 as well.      Voorhees said the integration will not only allow U.S. customers to use the platform without needing to perform KYC onboarding, but also will let ShapeShift open up “more jurisdictions, not fewer” as the exchange “removes itself from regulated activity.”      “Because ShapeShift is no longer acting as any form of financial intermediary or counterparty, this new, frictionless [user experience] frees users from having to provide personal, private information,” a press release from ShapeShift states.    See also: How the Incoming Administration Can Fix Crypto Regulation  Counterparty no more    DEXs operate as trading systems on top of blockchains, such as Ethereum. True DEXs are completely permissionless and have eaten into centralized exchange volumes over 2020. For example, Uniswap cites itself as the fifth-largest spot-trading cryptocurrency exchange, after riding $6 billion in monthly trading volume in both August and September that briefly surpassed dominant U.S. exchange Coinbase.      Voorhees said prices on ShapeShift should benefit from DeFi liquidity as users gain more price exposure by routing orders through multiple exchanges. Indeed, the composable nature of DeFi markets has made some asset pairs more competitive than centralized alternatives such as ETH/USDC.      “By integrating a dozen new liquidity sources, the pricing of assets is even more competitive. So, there is no trade-off for pricing. These new markets are highly liquid, and in addition to great pricing customers will now enjoy much higher order size limits,” he said.

42405620,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAedj5M,1609936200,"Valid Points: New Year, New Price Gains For ETH","Bullish price activity has tipped the total value of ETH locked into Ethereum 2.0 past $2.4 billion. Find out what other network metrics have been impacted by ether’s latest price gains.      It’s safe to say that 2021 is off to a great start for Ethereum.      Since ringing in the new year on January 1, the price of ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the network, has appreciated 48% and surpassed the threshold of $1,150 for the first time since January 2018.      On Ethereum 2.0, a higher ETH price means higher earnings for validators. However, it also means a higher barrier to entry for users wanting to become new participants of the network through purchasing and depositing 32 ETH.      While rewards earned by Ethereum 2.0 validators have stabilized over the last two weeks to around 0.008 ETH/day, the market value of these earnings has continued to rise from roughly $5 to now $8/day. Bullish price activity has also tipped the total value of ETH locked into the network past $2.4 billion as of Jan. 5, 2021.      As of last Wednesday, Dec. 30, over 1,000 new validators have locked funds into the Eth 2.0 deposit contract, all of which will begin earning rewards in a few weeks time. The validator queue is currently at 17,425 meaning anyone that joins Eth 2.0 now by staking 32 ETH (worth roughly $32,646 at time of writing) will have to wait up to 20 days before they’re able to do anything on the network.      For the 51,000 validators that have already been admitted, the vast majority of these participants are taking full advantage of their roles proposing, attesting and voting on blocks. The network participation rate, which measures the percentage of eligible validators that are online and actively helping progress the blockchain, has hovered consistently between 96% to 99% since mid-December.      The CoinDesk Eth 2.0 validator is not yet among these active validators, however, we will be soon! More information to come about our setup over the next few weeks.    New frontiers    Monday, one of the bullish arguments for Ethereum as both a platform and an asset (ETH) was produced by none other than a federal regulator.      According to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), national banks and federal savings institutions can now use public blockchains as settlement mechanisms – particularly for stablecoins.      The news was front-run by not only some of the highest Ethereum gas fees in the last calendar year – which hosts the majority of dollars circulating in the $30 billion stablecoin market – but also a giant one day leap in the price of ether (ETH). The asset climbed some 30% to over $1,000 for the first time since the coin’s 2018 bull market.      So, what does that mean for Ethereum? Demand for blockspace on Ethereum is high, as is demand for ether, the asset. Some of the recent price action can be explained by institutional pressure, Antoni Trenchev, co-founder and managing partner of Nexo said in a statement.      “Ethereum at $1K is no nine-day wonder. With bitcoin’s skyrocketing prices, institutional investors are hard-pressed to diversify their portfolios,” he said.      But it’s not all FOMO. Indeed, ether has risen to parity or even surpassed bitcoin (BTC) in terms of daily settlement, according to Money Movers.      That’s good for the network even if frustrating for decentralized finance (DeFi) degenerates, as Castle Island Ventures co-founder Nic Carter pointed out in a recent CoinDesk op-ed.      To summarize Carter, using the “world computer” costs ether, which will push Ethereum towards the most productive activities. Stablecoins are likely to be one of those activities given the cryptographic advantage (such as verifiability and permissionless) each dollar-pegged token has over current digital alternatives. If it’s not able to, then either another blockchain will take its place or the idea of the private dollar will have to find another means of market entry.      A surge in stablecoin activity is one possible outcome from the recent OCC guidance. Is Ethereum ready to handle billions more dollars in assets, contracts and users from stablecoins, becoming a competitor to ACH and SWIFT?      The short answer is no. That’s why Eth 2.0 – a project begun before the Ethereum genesis block was mined back in 2015 – is so important: Ethereum cannot become a platform for decentralized applications (dapp), let alone finance, without a scaling solution.      In that sense, betting on Ethereum and Eth 2.0 is an investment in public blockchains that support various economic activities like stablecoins.      “Unlike BTC, however, ETH lacks a digital gold narrative and is instead a fresh target for a different breed of institutional investor – one interested in its long-term technological promise, revived by the launch of ETH 2.0,” Trenchev said.

42405618,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAedj1Q,1609934410,"Stellar's XLM Token Rallies to 2-Year High on XRP Woes, OCC Ruling, Ukraine","Payments-focused Stellar blockchain's native cryptocurrency XLM has surged to over two-year highs. One analyst says the rally is driven by rival cryptocurrency XRP's current misfortunes and the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency's (OCC) recent guidance on stablecoins.      XLM changed hands at $0.2990 at 11:00 UTC, the highest level since November 2018. The third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has doubled in value so far this week and has gained more than 50% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      Trading volumes have picked up along with the price rally. ""Average volumes captured by the CF Benchmarks' XLM/USD settlement price has more than doubled in the past 14 days,"" Sui Chung, CEO of CF Benchmarks told CoinDesk. Price gains backed by an uptick in volumes are considered sustainable by chart analysts.      According to Denis Vinokourov, head of research at the London-based prime brokerage Bequant, XLM is enjoying a two-fold benefit at the expense of XRP, in part, because XLM is a modified fork of XRP.      On Dec. 22, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple Labs, Ripple Labs, a San Francisco-based developer of the Ripple payment protocol and exchange network, for raising $1.3 billion over a seven-year period to retail investors through its sale of XRP. Since then, the price of XRP has halved to near $0.20 and the crypto community is speculating that funds are being rotated out of XRP into XLM.      Further, XLM seems to be benefitting from the U.S. OCC's recent decision to allow U.S. banks to use public blockchains and dollar-backed stablecoins as a settlement infrastructure in the financial system, Vinokourov told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat, while adding, ""XRP is unlikely to benefit from in the meantime as it deals with the SEC case.""  In addition, XLM is continuing to rise following Stellar's announcement earlier this week that it's helping Ukraine develop a central bank digital currency (CBDC). Even though Ukraine has since downplayed the importance of Stellar's role and that the XLM coin would play no part in the CBDC, it apparently hasn't stopped some investors from buying the token.      ""It was reported that the Ukrainian government selected the Stellar blockchain network to build its prospective CBDC,"" CF Benchmark's Chung told CoinDesk. ""This is turning into a perfect storm for XLM.""      Also read: Bitcoin Sets New All-Time High Above $35K      At press time, XLM is changing hands near $0.2850, and XRP is trading at $0.2290, down 3% on a 24-hour basis. Several cryptocurrency exchanges have delisted XRP since the SEC announced its lawsuit on Ripple. Further, Grayscale Investments has removed XRP from its large-cap crypto fund and and crypto fund manager Bitwise has liquidated its XRP holdings.

42405613,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAedivW,1609927657,Veteran Investor Bill Miller Says Bitcoin Is Cash's 'Rat Poison',"Investor Bill Miller, whose flagship mutual fund in 2020 beat the S&P 500 index for the straight second year, said he believes bitcoin could replace cash and markets are underpricing inflation risk.      ""Warren Buffett famously called bitcoin rat poison. He may well be right. Bitcoin could be rat poison, and the rat could be cash,"" Miller noted in this Q4 market newsletter, adding that the cryptocurrency has many advantages over gold as an inflation hedge.      Legendary investor Buffett referred to bitcoin as ""probably rat poison squared"" and as a gambling instrument in 2018. However, several public-listed companies such as MicroStrategy and Square diversified their cash holdings into bitcoin in the second half of 2020, boosting its appeal as a store of value.      Bitcoin has rallied by over 160% in the past three months and rose to record highs above $35,000 early Wednesday. The cryptocurrency's market capitalization now stands at $670 billion, more than Berkshire Hathaway, the company Buffett helms.      According to Miller, the current relative trickle into bitcoin would become a torrent if more companies invest in the cryptocurrency, irrespective of inflation.      So far, the cost of living in the U.S. has remained well below the Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target despite the central bank's massive stimulus measures launched to counter the coronavirus-induced slowdown. However, Miller believes the market is likely ""underestimating the risks of inflation.""      ""Savings rates are unusually high and, as the economy becomes more ""normal"" in the second half of the year, it is likely that consumption will accelerate and, with it, money velocity. Lots of liquidity and increasing money velocity could quickly put upward pressure on inflation,"" Miller noted.

The new regulation is being criticized by some in the crypto sector, who argue the ban is a setback and that retail investors should have access to the same opportunities as institutions.

42405610,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAedixU,1609916623,Former Bakkt CEO Kelly Loeffler Loses Senate Seat; Democrats Retake Senate,"Former Bakkt CEO Kelly Loeffler (R-Ga.) will not return for a full term as a U.S. Senator, AP projected Wednesday.      Loeffler, who ran against Democrat Raphael Warnock, lost her Senate seat in a special election Tuesday after serving for just over a year. She left the crypto warehousing company late in December 2019 to fill former Sen. Johnny Isakson’s seat after Isakson stepped down due to health concerns. Fellow Republican David Perdue likewise lost his seat after Democrat Jon Ossoff was projected to win later on Wednesday.      Both Democrats winning clear the way for President-elect Joe Biden to enact his agenda by creating a 50-50 split (with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris acting as tiebreaker) in the upper house.      Either Republican winning would have allowed Majority Leader Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to enjoy another two years running the Senate, where he could have controlled key confirmation votes for both Biden’s legislative agenda and Cabinet nominees, including Janet Yellen, Biden’s pick to run the Treasury Department.      Democrats controlling the Senate also mean the various committees overseeing the crypto space, such as the Senate Banking Committee, have new priorities for the next Congressional session.      Cook Political Report's Dave Wasserman projected Ossoff to win the race late Tuesday. Democrats have controlled the House of Representatives since 2018.      Earlier Tuesday night, some crypto-powered prediction markets bet on both Democrats winning. Polymarket had predicted that Warnock will win since Dec. 31, and Ossoff to win since earlier this month. FTX similarly predicted Dems would win.      Loeffler ran Bakkt since its inception in mid-2018 through her appointment to Congress. However, the senator hasn’t so much as mentioned bitcoin or cryptocurrencies since taking office, despite being a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, which oversaw the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a key regulator in the crypto space (and the one that oversees Bakkt).      Loeffler was embroiled in controversy in early 2020 after the Daily Beast reported she and her husband, Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) CEO Jeffrey Sprecher, sold between $1.3 million and $3.2 million in stock after she received a private Senate briefing on the potential spread of COVID-19 within the U.S.      An ICE statement at the time claimed financial advisoes to the two made those transactions independently.      Loeffler refused to concede early Wednesday morning, though the act of conceding is a tradition rather than a legal requirement. In doing so, she continues to follow President Donald Trump's playbook. He president has similarly refused to concede losing November's election, despite subsequently losing over 60 legal challenges to overturn several states' election results.

Bitcoin set a new all-time high of $35,106, just as this post was going live.  Throughout this price action, cryptocurrency traders starting cutting leveraged positions across the board, according to estimates calculated by cryptocurrency data provider CryptoQuant. Taking to Twitter, CEO Ki Young Ju said the change signaled traders were ""uncertain"" and ""scared"" about the markets ""next move.""  With fresh record highs, the market's direction seems a bit more clear.  ""It's rather simple I think,"" said Matt Kaye, managing partner at Santa Monica-based Blockhead Capital, talking to CoinDesk about bitcoin's price action. ""There are more spot buyers than spot sellers going into a year that is likely going to transform U.S. fiscal policy for the next decade.""

42405614,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAediyT,1609898400,Origin Brings Back Interest-Earning OUSD Stablecoin Following $7M Hack,"Origin is relaunching its yield-generating stablecoin following a November attack that drained OUSD holders of $7 million.      Starting now, users can once again exchange USDC, USDT and DAI for OUSD.      As CoinDesk reported in September, the smart contract powering OUSD was not yet audited. OUSD allowed users to deposit the most popular stablecoins that would be plugged into decentralized finance (DeFi) yield farming strategies, the returns on which would be returned to OUSD holders by increasing the balance in each wallet.    See also: Origin Debuts OUSD, a Stablecoin That Works Like a Savings Account    By November, the smart contract had $7 million locked in it, which the company argues proved demand. However, in mid-November it was drained due to a re-entrancy bug in the smart contract (the same exploit that sunk the original DAO).      ""We remain committed to our vision of a superior stablecoin for the Ethereum network. Despite the setback from the hack, we are returning with renewed confidence that we are building something important, that people really want,"" Josh Fraser, Origin CEO, said in a statement.    OUSD compensation plan    On Dec. 11, Origin released a plan for compensating users who lost funds in the attack. The first 1,000 OUSD lost for each user would be fully compensated in OUSD. After that, holders still get compensated but with a little OUSD now and a lot of Origin's governance token, OGN, later.      There have been several tokens that gain value in much the same way as OUSD. For example, Aave's aUSDT and Curve's yUSD currently boast returns of more than 10% annual yield as of this writing. Ampleforth's AMPL works somewhat differently but offers comparable passive benefits.      With the relaunch, the team released a fresh post-mortem on the attack, where they found several places where their security had broken down. OUSD contracts have now been through two audits, a better update procedure is in place and they are exploring insurance.      ""Going forward, security will be our number one priority for OUSD,"" Fraser said. ""While we will continue to strive to offer highly competitive yields, we learned the hard way that security needs to come first.""",POSITIVE,USDT | DAI | USDC,ETH | EXCHANGE | USDT | DAI | USDC,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/01/06/origin-brings-back-interest-earning-ousd-stablecoin-following-7m-hack,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/27b44c762bb7180e920a7e24436b9b964e89e0d5-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The crypto custodian has also launched Wrapped Ether (WETH) on Tron as well.    BitGo clients are already minting WBTC and WETH as TRC-20 tokens on Tron, according to the company's public orderbooks.  After a few test mints executed by BitGo in mid-December, nearly 100 BTC (roughly $3.4 million at current prices) have been wrapped and minted as TRC-20 WBTC tokens by Alameda Research and CoinList.  Alameda also minted 1 WETH on Tron Tuesday morning. The trading firm's TRC-20 WBTC and WETH mints were made to meet over-the-counter (OTC) client demand and test the new product, Alameda's Ryan Salame told CoinDesk.  BitGo announced a partnership with Tron in September with plans to bring WBTC and WETH to the Justin Sun-founded network, per CoinDesk's prior reporting. Now the project is fully operational.  ""Our blossoming alliance with BitGo has finally brought cross-chain solutions like WBTC and WETH to fruition,"" Sun said in a statement.

As the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector has cooled off, however, the supply of ERC-20 WBTC has dipped to its current level of nearly 110,000 tokens.  In September, the total value of all Ethereum-based tokenized bitcoin projects passed $1 billion for the first time.
