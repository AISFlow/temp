42397955,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEp4j,1411428606,Unisend Targets Mexico as Latest Market for Latin American Expansion,"Unisend has officially expanded to Mexico and will launch trading in the market this evening via its new website Unisend.com.mx.  The Argentina-based bitcoin exchange's domestic bank accounts were suddenly closed earlier this August, a development that temporarily halted consumer deposits and bank transfers. However, it continues to serve the market as it seeks to more broadly expand its services in Latin America.  If Unisend's goal is to become a reference point for bitcoin trading across the region, as founder Pablo Esterson indicated in a conversation with CoinDesk, Mexico is the first step in its expansion plan, which includes Uruguay, Brazil, Chile and Peru.  “We're looking forward to offering all our users an easy way to buy and sell bitcoins, always using local banks in order to keep competitive, quick withdrawals and deposit commission for local currencies,” Esterson said.  Esterson explained:  “Our plan is to have a subsidiary company and a local bank account in all the countries where we are present and allow people to operate in our Latin America global platform using a local bank to withdraw and load funds.”  Unisend said fees will be waived during the first few weeks after launch, and that registered users will receive a bonus for helping other users make their first trades.  Both those who refer new users who spend between Mex$1 and Mex$3,000 on the platform as well as those who spend this amount during the promotional period will receive a 1.5% bonus. Bonuses of 2.5% and 3% are also available to those who spend between Mex$3,000 and Mex$10,000 and more than Mex$10,000, respectively.  The exchange is open for money transfers and will integrate cash and credit card payments that enable people to buy bitcoin.  Banks vs payments solutions  Since the disruption of its banking resources this summer, the company has had to work with a payments solution provider in order to continue serving Argentina, making it harder for people to gain access to its tools and resources.  The team is now seeking to open up new bank accounts so it can increase its volume and provide a more stable service to its user base. Unisend partner José Rodriguez told CoinDesk that working with a local banking partner helps it reduce costs for users.  As a result, the company said its fees for bank-to-bank transfers within Mexico cost between US$0 and US$1 depending on the bank, a fee structure it believes gives it an edge to other payment solution providers like AstroPay, which charge between 2% and 5% of the total amount transferred.  Further, the exchange rate is higher than market price when exchanging from a local currency to USD or pesos.  “Its a solution but expensive for the user,” Rodriguez added.  Regulation threat still looms  Rodriguez went on to tell CoinDesk that Mexican banking and securities authorities have cautioned Unisend, advising that, for the time being, “bitcoin operations, payments or exchanges will not be forbidden or regulated yet”.  He explained:  “We are complying with the suggestions they have made about documenting customers and reporting future suspicious activity. With banks and SHCP (the Mexican IRS), I have been transparent about our activity.”  By contrast Argentina's postition towards bitcoin is still uncertain, neither supporting nor prohibiting companies like Unisend, Esterson said.  “That makes it a little hard for us to find financial institutions to support our operations, though we are still on our way to opening new accounts,” he added. “In the meantime we are still operating with other payment options.”  Global strategy, local approach  To begin, Unisend Mexico will operate on its own, independent of its Argentinean counterpart. However, Esterson said the company is working to integrate the two platforms into a global exchange for the whole of Latin America.  Mexico  is the largest Spanish-speaking country in Latin America and second most populous after Brazil, he added, citing such attributes along with the country's widespread access to the Internet as the main reasons to replicate Unisend’s operations there first.  Esterson said:  “With our launch in Mexico … people will have more opportunities to get into the bitcoin world, the bitcoin community will keep growing, the bitcoin industry gets reinforced and we get a large new market and expand our operations.”  Images via Unisend and Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Tanaya Macheel,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/09/22/unisend-targets-mexico-as-latest-market-for-latin-american-expansion,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dd3c249b7f8069d83320109fa7d8dbe002e2a2a1-1000x664.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397960,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEpBc,1411418144,"Mining Roundup: Litecoin's Milestone, Lab Rat's Lawsuit and BitFury's Board Boost","Does the drop in the price of bitcoin have you down? Don’t worry – if the continued rise in the bitcoin difficulty is any indication, the network isn’t going anywhere anytime soon.  This week’s Mining Roundup spans from a key moment in litecoin’s mining history to growth for BitFury’s leadership and advisorial teams. We also shine the spotlight on a discussion that many miners are thinking about these days: what does this latest price drop mean for bitcoin's future?  Litecoin breaches 1 terahash in mining power  On 15th September, litecoin – the oldest of the scrypt family of alternative digital currencies – passed an important network milestone. The network hash rate surpassed 1 Th/s after several days of significant increase, pushing the litecoin difficulty past 30,000 at the same time.  While the network hash rate has since declined – at press time, the network hashrate was roughly 740 GH/s, according to liteshack.com. The upswing suggests that there is still faith in the stature and profitability of the nearly three-year-old altcoin.  The jump in network hash rate was expected by some as more scrypt ASICs hit the marketplace. KnCMiner reportedly began shipping its Titan ASIC earlier this month, while options from other manufacturers have been available for some time. Observers say that what we’re seeing now are the first waves of the ASIC-ification of the litecoin network.  The increase may also be a result of the recent decision to merge mine dogecoin with litecoin. This could have promoted some dogecoin miners to shift their hashing power to the litecoin network, as they’d be able to generate DOGE regardless.  On the litecoin subreddit, several community members celebrated the jump as a boon for the network’s security and long-term viability. As one poster suggested, the moment is similar to when the bitcoin network surpassed 1 terahash in mining power, a key moment in that coin’s developmental history.  Others were more skeptical about the achievement, saying that the arrival of ASICs opens the network up to more consolidation of power among larger miners, particularly manufacturers that may also mine with their equipment.  BitFury adds talent to board, strategic council  Bitcoin mining company BitFury has spent the past few months making strategic investments that will support its ambitions of leading the sector’s hardware arms race. This includes raising millions of dollars in venture capital and rolling out new consumer-facing products like hosted mining contracts.  BitFury said on 22nd September that it had formed a strategic board comprised of representatives from the technology and venture capital industries.  Dr Jackson Hu  , a former chairman and CEO of Taiwan-based semiconductor maker UMC has joined the strategic board alongside Jonathan Teo, the founder of Binary Capital and a former R&D executive at Google.  The company also announced that Bob Dykes, a former CFO of VeriFone and founder of digital dining platform Tanjarine, had joined its board of directors. He will serve on the company’s budget and audit committees, the announcement said.  BitFury CEO Valery Vavilov hailed the additions in a statement, noting:  “These new members of our board of directors and advisory board will provide valuable input to ensure that BitFury is well positioned to retain its leadership role in silicon design and technology in the fast-paced and constantly evolving virtual currency marketplace.”  The addition of Teo is notable given the company’s interest in acting as a source of investment for bitcoin startups.  BitFury Capital  , formed earlier this year, will provide funding to the industry, and the Binary Capital founder could have a role to play as the investment fund begins deploying capital.  Lab Rat faces investor suit  A group of bitcoin community members and investors are suing Lab Rat Data Processing, an independent mining operation that sold a series of contracts through online bitcoin crowdfunding platform Bitfunder.  According to documents filed in the US District Court of Tampa, 12 plaintiffs are suing New Jersey-based Lab Rat and its owner, Zachary Dailey for misrepresentation, breach of contract and fraud.  The plaintiffs are being represented by Florida-based law firm Akerman LLP. In the court filing dated 26th August, it was alleged that Lab Rat tried to “coerce the Plaintiffs to relinquish their contractual and other legal rights” by presenting new contracts with reworded conditions. The plaintiffs said that the company lied about its ability to pay dividends to shareholders, resulting in approximately 2,430.35 BTC, or about $1.5m, in claimed losses.  On the company’s official Bitcoin Talk forum post, Dailey declined to comment publicly, saying that more clarification could come in the days ahead pending approval from his legal team.  He noted:  “There will likely be multiple responses before one of true importance is even worth sharing. I'll ask my lawyers if I should share or just let you guys pull from public records…”  In separate posts Dailey pledged to fight the charges. The company has also posted regular dividends from its mining operation, according to updates on Bitcoin Talk.  Difficult times coming for bitcoin’s difficulty?  Given the decline in the price of bitcoin, many hobby miners are concerned their operations may soon cease to be profitable.  While industrial-scale operations are more immune from the issue owing to their stature in the network and corporate backing, those who have invested funds and mine at home are always mindful of the fact that, ultimately, a lack of returns might drive them to power down their machines.  A recent discussion on Bitcoin Talk saw several forum members discussing at which price point the mining sector would begin to see serious disruptions in participation. The conversation also focused on when the bitcoin mining network difficulty – the measure detailing how hard it is to discover new blocks – might fall as a result of a sustained price decline. The difficulty rises and falls as miners join or leave the network, respectively.  Some argued that the price could fall as low as $150 per coin before a significant number of miners decide to unplug and the difficulty drops. Others called those estimates too generous, saying that anything below $350 would pose a long-term threat to the network.  As one forum member wrote, there is still investment momentum that will keep the difficulty rising for the forseeable future. They speculated that the difficulty could continue rising at present rates until mid-2015, saying:  “Difficulty changes are then likely to follow the value of bitcoin even if with a lag. It is the same as the amount of gold mining around the world changing as the value of gold changes. If it is profitable to mine lower grade gold you can be sure miners will appear. If it becomes unprofitable for certain gold mines they will eventually close.”  There are other dynamics that are difficult to quantify that could also shape future development, including the willingness of miners both large and small to mine bitcoins at a loss. It’s possible that, even if the price continues its current downtrend, the difficulty will keep on rising for the foreseeable future.  Got a cryptocurrency mining tip for future roundups?

42397953,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEp5i,1411414247,New Challengers Seek Election to UK Digital Currency Group Board,"A non-profit organisation in the UK that counts some of the country's more prominent cryptocurrency entrepreneurs and advocates will soon hold its first board elections.  Ten candidates will stand for five positions on the board of the UK Digital Currencies Association (UKDCA) during the election, which takes place on 26th September.  Paul Ferris, who leads the association's communications working group, said:  ""They're very important elections. They are the first elections of the board, the [current] board members have been acting so far as interim [board members] until we get the democracy side of things in place.""  The UKDCA was formed in November by about 50 individuals and businesses.  It is currently run by an 'interim board' whose members were appointed during the association's formation. From the start, the UKDCA planned to replace the interim board with an elected group.  New faces on candidates slate  The new board will shrink by two seats. All seven current board members are standing for election. They are joined by Taboola's Nadav Rosenberg, Bitnet's Akif Khan and Richard Folsom of Kemp Little LLP, newcomers who promise to intensify competition.  The 10 candidates standing for election are:  Eric Benz, GoCoin  Adam Cleary, Bullion Bitcoin  Simon Dixon, BankToTheFuture.com  Richard Folsom, Kemp Little LLP  Paul Gordon, Coinscrum  Eitan Jankelewitz, Sheridans  Akif Kahn, Bitnet  Tom Robinson, Elliptic  Nadav Rosenberg, Taboola  Adam Vaziri, Diacle.  Folsom, a technology lawyer, said in his statement of intent for the election that he participated to increase transparency within the association and that he would work to make regulators' informal guidance to the UKDCA more available to members if elected.  Khan brings a decade's worth of experience with payments processor CyberSource, which was acquired by Visa for $2bn in 2010. He said he ""speaks the language"" of players in the payments and e-commerce worlds in his statement of intent.  Rosenberg, who is general manager for Europe at Taboola, which makes content recommendation tools for publishers, also brings experience leading Groupon's expansion efforts in Europe. He is an investor in XBTerminal, the digital currency point-of-sale terminal. He said he will focus on ""demystifying"" digital currencies if he is elected.  Association furthers its cause  The 10 candidates will compete for votes from an electorate of 80 dues-paying voting members. The association also has 120 'supporter' members, who have joined for free but who cannot cast a vote in the elections.  Membership dues  at the UKDCA cost individuals £20 a year or £400 for a lifetime membership; startups £200 a year; and established businesses £1,000 a year.  According to Ferris, the group has ""not inconsiderable"" resources today, and working groups have found themselves busier than expected as the cryptocurrency landscape develops at a rapid pace.  ""There is a lot to do. If we're going to do this properly, we need people to put in more than a couple of days a month,"" he said.  While some organisations – like the Bitcoin Association, another non-profit group – have publicly stated that they will decentralise their organisations using the Ethereum platform, the UKDCA hasn't taken such a step yet. But Ferris says the group has ""wide ambitions"" to do so eventually. However, the board has to be elected before such a move can be made, he added, concluding:  ""If we said this is how we're gong to do it before the board itself is elected, that would be the wrong thing to do.""

42397959,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEp8f,1411411238,Jack Dorsey: Square Register Will Integrate Bitcoin,"Square CEO Jack Dorsey has issued new statements suggesting that the mobile payments giant may seek to add bitcoin to its Register product.  Dorsey's comments came in an interview with the CBC, in which he was asked for his response to the introduction of Apple Pay to the mobile payments market.  Noting that Square offers a terminal product that can accept a variety of payment methods, including Apple Pay, Dorsey told the media outlet:  ""We're building a register so that sellers can accept a credit card, so they can accept cash, so they can accept a cheque, so they can accept bitcoin and so they can accept any form of payment that comes across the counter including future ones and burgeoning ones like Apple Pay.""  Though the full meaning of Dorsey's statements is unclear, the integration would mark the second time to date that Square has moved to embrace bitcoin as a payment method. This March, the company added a 'Pay with Bitcoin' option to Square Market, its online merchant marketplace.  In comments to CoinDesk, Square was similarly opaque about its chief executive's message.  ""I'll just use this as an opportunity to reiterate our belief that Square sellers should never have to miss out on a sale; they should be able to accept any form of payment,"" a spokesperson said.  Notably, Square recently closed a $100m funding round, and currently offers its Register service to merchants in the US, Canada and Japan.  Square Register evolves  The statements are notable as Square's Register product currently accepts all major credit cards, including American Express, Discover, MasterCard and Visa, charging 2.75% per swipe for its processing service.  As such, the integration of bitcoin would mark a departure from what has to date been the company's core value propositions, its mobile credit card reader.  However, the potential move could also be seen as part of Square's overall evolution away from credit cards to become more inclusive in its payment methods through the addition of cash and cheques.  In addition to payment acceptance, its Register product also allows merchants to send digital receipts, accept orders online and manage analytics.  Merchant reach  The addition would also be a potential boon for bitcoin, which could gain exposure to Square's dedicated user base. Founded in 2009, Square has seen prolific growth in the US, signing up nearly 40,000 retailers for its platform as of the end of 2012.  Square has been particularly adept at gaining the support of small merchants, many of whom turn to the company to avoid more costly, traditional point-of-sale (POS) installations.  While positive for bitcoin in terms of exposure, critics of Square's handling of bitcoin integration have emerged. For example, merchants who accept bitcoin via Square market continue to pay a 2.75% transaction fee.

42397945,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEovs,1411403706,Belgian Tax Body: Bitcoin Trades Not Subject to VAT,"Belgium's Federal Public Service Finance (FPS) has issued a new statement finding that certain domestic digital currency transactions are not subject to value-added tax (VAT).  The ruling from the tax body was revealed in an email to local digital exchange Belgacoin, which was concerned it would need to pay VAT on digital currency trades.  Speaking to CoinDesk, an FPS spokesperson confirmed that bitcoin trading transactions are currently exempt from the country's VAT Code, as bitcoins are not a legal means of payment. However, the agency did suggest that this exemption may only be temporary.  FPS senior advisor and investigator Chantal Pahaut told CoinDesk:  ""The Belgian position is likely to change according to the position of the European Committee, which is trying to define a harmonization at European level.""  The clarification comes at a time when many European countries are seeking larger guidance on the issue from the European Court of Justice (ECJ) as to whether digital currency exchanges need to pay VAT taxes on service fees.  The statements also mark the first time Belgium has provided insight into its policies on the issue. Belgacoin indicated that it is not clear if VAT applies to merchant-customer transactions.  Retroactive tax unlikely  The FPS said that bitcoin trading transactions are currently exempt from VAT under Article 44 of the country's VAT code, telling Belgacoin that should the determination be reversed, a retroactive tax will not be applied.  Belgacoin said the decision removes a critical uncertainty for the company, which buys and sells bitcoin as well as a host of altcoins including litecoin, dogecoin and peercoin.  Belgacoin told CoinDesk:  ""[The email is] vastly sufficient for me – in the future, it will not be contradicted by another VAT controller.""  In its official post on Reddit announcing the news, Beglacoin indicated that the decision brings Belgium in line with the UK, which eliminated its VAT on bitcoin trading in March.  A form of consumption tax, VAT is assessed on the cost of the product, minus the cost of materials. In the case of Belgacoin, the company indicated it would need to add an additional 21% to the price of the digital currency it sells in order to cover this added expense.  Europe's VAT shadow continues  Belgium's decision highlights a current split on this issue dividing Europe.  While Belgium and the UK have taken a more progressive stance on bitcoin trading, others like Estonia and Poland have imposed 20% and 23% VAT respectively on certain bitcoin business activities.  Ultimately, experts suggest that the ECJ's ruling on VAT for EU countries may not be forthcoming. European tax lawyer Esteban van Goor, for example, told CoinDesk in August that the decision could take up to two years to be delivered.  For now, however, Belgacoin indicated that the decision will allow the company, which makes only 1% margin on transactions, to better compete against other major international exchanges.  ""It's nice for us, because we're trying to make it easier to buy for customers,"" the company added.

42377641,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX72gWL,1411392745,Greenpeace USA Signs Up for Bitcoin Donations,"Environmental campaign organization Greenpeace has announced it will start accepting bitcoin donations in its USA division via a partnership with payment processor BitPay.  The move offers cost savings for the organisation, as well as the possibility of tapping into new sources of funds.  Greenpeace  does not accept donations from corporations or governments, instead, the nonprofit relies on individual donations. This practice comes with a drawback, however, since the cost of many, relatively small, transactions can easily add up.  This largely because credit card companies and other traditional payment providers usually charge nonprofits the same as commercial organisations, about 3–4% per transaction.  Bitcoin, though, offers significant savings for charities by doing away with these fees.  Bitcoin's cost benefit  BitPay  and other payment providers like Coinbase do not charge fees for nonprofits, meaning the entire donation is delivered to the charity.  BitPay non-profit account manager Elizabeth Ploshay said the company strives to bring bitcoin to nonprofits like Greenpeace.  ""For each bitcoin donation, Greenpeace gets 100% of what is being donated, increasing the amount of each donation received,” she said.  Ben Kroetz, Greenpeace USA director of online strategy, explained why the organisation chose BitPay to process its bitcoin payments:  “BitPay’s reputation as a trusted and secure third-party bitcoin payment processor made it easy for us to begin accepting bitcoin, thus opening us up to new markets and donors.”  Unrealised potential  Bitcoin's proponents have long been arguing that digital currencies offer a range of potential benefits for charities. Bitcoin transactions can be cheaper and faster than traditional payments, while at the same time offering more possibilities for charities and donors through various escrow and multi-signature services.  However, the promise of bitcoin charities has not been fully realised yet. Although a number of successful nonprofits such as homeless outreach Sean’s Outpost were created by bitcoin enthusiasts, most mainstream charities have steered clear from digital currencies.  This is now starting to change, though. Earlier this month, United Way Worldwide, which raised $5bn last year, became the biggest privately held charity to accept bitcoin via Coinbase.  Wikipedia and a number of open-source software organisations have also decided to start accepting bitcoin donations.  Greenpeace is the most recognisable environmental charity in the world, with more than 2,400 employees and 15,000 volunteers, hence its decision to embrace bitcoin can be viewed as another seal of approval for the concept of utilising digital currencies for low-friction fundraising.

The company says it is the first online bitcoin payments system in Japan and its motto is 'Bitcoin for Everyone'. Bitbank's feature list now includes a wallet service, the 'Bitbank Register' service for local payments at local restaurants, and 'Bitbank Pay' specifically for online businesses.  Fees and accounts  Bitbank Pay is available to merchants for payments as low as ¥10 (approx. $0.10), with no monthly fees and transaction fees from 0–1.5%. There are more premium services available on its 'business' and 'premium' plans. Additionally, many fees for those plans are waived or heavily reduced during Bitbank Pay's introductory period.  There is a quick sign-up without need for documentation, and easy implementation into an e-commerce system even for non-coders.  Funding and development  Bitbank  has also just completed a second round of funding, having secured over $1.4m in total. Another round is planned in the near future.  A spokesperson from the firm, Emily Liu, said it is important for Japan to ""be more international"" and that bitcoin acceptance is a path to the future.  ""Bitbank Inc is built with very experienced people, [who] are definitely bitcoin fanatics. The fact that we are all devoted to bitcoin and each of us experienced in different fields, gives us the confidence that we will accomplish our goal of promoting bitcoin to Japan.""  The company's co-founder and CEO is one of Japan's leading bitcoin evangelists Hiroki Minematsu, a programmer with a long involvement with bitcoin and who has appeared regularly in the Japanese media to discuss digital currency issues.  The firm's other co-founder, who asked not to be named, was the first to import a Robocoin bitcoin ATM to Japan, and Bitbank plans to launch its own branded machine soon.  The need to inform  Liu said there is still a need to educate people in the country about bitcoin, but that Japanese people had a head start with a range of well-developed electronic cash systems used for transit fares and throughout the retail sector, which include Suica, Pasmo and Edy.  ""After the Mt Gox incident, a part of Japan has been doubtful when it comes to cryptocurrency, another part still doesn't know about bitcoin. People are more accepting when something is used daily or in a more common way. It is the same with bitcoin, which is why we started with these services.""  Japanese people have also embraced e-commerce as both buyers and merchants, whether independently or at vast shopping online shopping malls like Rakuten and Amazon.jp.  For those without credit cards, convenience stores sell a range of debit card solutions. Customers can also use the stores as payment/delivery points.

42377639,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX72gTp,1411385728,Netagio Becomes First UK Bitcoin Company to Meet Auditing Standard,"British precious metal and bitcoin exchange Netagio has received ISAE 3000 standard certification for its bitcoin storage following a review by professional financial services firm BDO LLP.  The news makes Netagio the first UK bitcoin company to comply with ISAE 3000.  ISAE 3000 is internationally recognized by the International Auditing and Assurance Standard Board (IAASB), and assesses quality of assurance work, report verification, internal compliance, corporate governance and other areas of corporate responsibility.  Review success  The company said it underwent the review earlier this year, which included the evaluation and testing of various control procedures employed on its platform. BDO LLP found that Netagio had put in place “adequate controls” needed to achieve the review’s control objectives.  The control procedures covered by the review were in operation as of 26th May 2014. Netagio launched its exchange a few weeks later in July.  Netagio  said its bitcoin, gold and sterling exchange was designed to “meet the highest compliance requirements and standards” of other registered financial exchanges.  Strengthened commitment  The company stressed that it adheres to the European Payment Services Directive, with stringent anti-money laundering (AML) rules, diligent customer on-boarding ‘know your customer’ (KYC) checks and continuous exchange and trade monitoring surveillance.  Netagio CEO Simon Hamblin said the company is delighted to announce its positive assessment in line with the ISAE 3000 standard.  He said:  “This latest recognition reinforces our commitment to growing our secure, peer-to-peer exchange platform on which to trade bitcoin, gold and sterling, and is a stepping stone towards maturity in the community of companies operating in the bitcoin space.”  Hamblin also said that the bitcoin economy is developing and prompting jurisdictions across the world to re-evaluate their regulatory frameworks. Any steps that can be taken to achieve internationally recognized standards will give further credibility to bitcoin in both financial and retail industries, he added.  George Quiqley, partner at BDO, said it is important for Netagio to be able to assure customers that proper controls are in place and that the company’s bitcoin storage complies with international standards.  “It is good to see Netagio leading the way for the industry by commissioning an external assurance review,” he said.

42377631,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX72gQ3,1411379815,The Student Network Taking Bitcoin to Colleges Around the Globe,"When Patrick Cines meets a fellow student on the campus of Pennsylvania State University, he'll whip out his phone to show them how quickly bitcoin can be sent from one account to another.  ""If they say they can already do that with a credit card, I tell them that they're paying to use that card, one way or another,"" he said.  Cines is an officer in the College Cryptocurrency Network (CCN), a fast-growing organisation that's trying to connect bitcoin clubs in universities around the world.  The network was formed in March and now has about 100 chapters comprising more than 1,000 students globally, although the majority are located on campuses in the United States, according to co-founder Jeremy Gardner.  The network aims to sign up student bitcoin organisations at universities as members for free. The network then organises various educational and outreach events across its chapters, pooling resources, like contacts with bitcoin companies and funding, as it does so.  For example, the network is organising an October event at Walt Disney World in Florida called Coins in the Kingdom that includes speakers such as Charlie Shrem and others.  Recruitment pipeline  The idea, according to Cines, is to raise awareness of bitcoin and digital currencies on college campuses. One of the advantages this offers to students is potentially guiding them into jobs in a hot new sector.  Cines points to banks, accounting and consulting firms who actively recruit new hires on college campuses through a pipeline of internships and placement programmes.  ""Accounting firms, they see it because they've been around for years. They're lining [students] up for a full-time job. It's just a matter of time before the bitcoin industry realises the same thing,"" he said.  The plan seems to be working. According to Cines, several members from MIT have completed summer internships at Circle, the high-profile startup founded by Jeremy Allaire that has raised $26m in funding to date.  The network's members have scored some high-profile hits already. At MIT, in particular, the club there launched a project to give out $500,000 worth of bitcoin to the student body. Dan Elitzer, who started the MIT Bitcoin Club and is CCN's treasurer, credits the network for its support.  ""Even though a lot of students look at the MIT Bitcoin Club as a prime example of a successful CCN chapter [...] if you want to make bitcoin a big thing on your campus, just reach out to CCN for resources created by other chapters to get you started,"" he said.  Sponsorship praise  The network doesn't collect dues from members, so it raises funding from sponsors. These include companies like DigitalBTC, Cines said, who pay to be associated with the group. In return, their brands get exposure to the student population at CCN events.  ""DigitalBTC sponsored CCN because we were excited about the opportunity to foster the greater take-up of bitcoin on college campuses [...] and the amazing innovation we can see when college students get their hands on new technology,"" said DigitalBTC's CEO Alex Karis.  ""So far it is going well [...] we've even asked if any of the college participants are interested in working with us part-time,"" he added.  Gardner, the network's co-founder, says activity among chapters remains concentrated on campuses in the northeastern US. This includes MIT and Harvard in Massachusetts, Rutgers in New Jersey and Middlebury College in Vermont.  One of CCN's focuses in the coming months will be to make bitcoin more visible on campuses. Cines says that ATMs are key to that mission. Cines is already working on getting an ATM placed on Penn State grounds.  ""There has to be more of a physical element to it. More bitcoin ATMs are crucial,"" he said.
