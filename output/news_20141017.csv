42377717,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73BWf,1413584410,Robocoin Customers Report Trail of Late Deliveries After Reddit Exposé,"Pioneering bitcoin ATM maker Robocoin has come under fire after an angry customer took to Reddit to publicise its grievances about how it was treated by the firm.  The customer, a company called MetaLab Design in Victoria, Canada, claimed the ATM it ordered from Robocoin was severely delayed and defective when it arrived. It said it was still waiting to be refunded after returning the unit.  Within a day of airing its grievances on Reddit, MetaLab said it got its money back from Robocoin. It proclaimed today on the message board that ""Internet justice has been served"", saying:  ""With the intense spotlight of Internet Justice focused on Robocoin, we got our $25,000 back along with a hangdog apology from [Jordan Kelley, Robocoin chief executive].""  While MetaLab no longer has to pursue its refund, its complaints are shared by several other Robocoin customers CoinDesk interviewed. These customers also said they had to wait months for delayed deliveries and described their dissatisfaction with other aspects of dealing with Robocoin.  Another Canadian operator's story  Matthew Sargent operates a Robocoin ATM in a shopping mall near the oil sands of Alberta, Canada, through his company, CoinRangers. His description of ordering a Robocoin machine is nearly identical to MetaLab's telling of events, although he says his machine was fully operational when it was delivered.  According to emails seen by CoinDesk, Sargent ordered a Robocoin ATM on 23rd November and was told his machine would be delivered in early March. A month earlier, the Bank of Canada had introduced $5 and $10 notes made of polymer, the final phase of a process to replace paper banknotes that began in 2011.  Sargent, conscious of this, emailed Kelley on 7th January to ask if his unit would work with the new notes. Kelley replied minutes later, but didn't answer the question. Sargent asked if his unit was on schedule, to which Kelley replied, ""Yessir"".  For the next two months, Kelley reassured Sargent that shipping was on schedule every time he asked. On 6th March, however, Kelley told Sargent that they were delaying their Canadian shipments until the end of the month, a few weeks off the original delivery date.  On 24th March Kelley informed Sargent that the delay was due to the new Canadian polymer notes, which required special note dispensers from Fujitsu. Three days earlier, Kelly had told MetaLab the same thing, according to the email screenshots it published on Reddit.  Similar delivery problems  On 10th June, Sargent received an email from TurnKey Kiosks, a company in Arizona that manufactures the ATMs for Robocoin. TurnKey informed him that its delivery company, UPS, was having trouble getting shipments into Canada because they were not being cleared by customs.  MetaLab's emails show that TurnKey also gave the same reasons for the delay in shipment three days later.  TurnKey's email to Sargent read:  ""We have been having issues with UPS clearing our Canadian shipments. Our UPS contact had been on vacation and returned today. But the shipments we had sent out last week are being held up in Canadian customs. For some reason UPS are not clearing these Canadian shipments. We held back your kiosk because we did not want it to be held up in customs.""  Sargent was given four options to ensure his machine made it across the border, ranging from sending it anyway and letting him clear it with customs officials at the border himself to hiring a custom broker called Geodis Wilson who would do the paperwork for him. Sargent decided to use the recommended broker, paying around CA$2,000 for Geodis Wilson's services.  MetaLab's emails show that TurnKey also gave them the same reasons for a delay in shipment three days after Sargent received his email. It also paid CA$2,000 for a customs broker.  Expenses incurred by delays  Both Sargent and MetaLab eventually received their ATMs in mid-June. Sargent got his machine on the week of 16th June, the same week MetaLab received its unit.  By the time Sargent had his machine running, he had paid CA$4,500 for three months in rent and the broker fee of CA$2,000. The delivery delay had cost him CA$6,500. MetaLab reported that it had spent CA$3,000 because of the delay.  Another dissatisfied Robocoin customer is SatoshiPoint, which ordered two machines from the firm. Co-founder Jonathan Harrison said his machines were delayed five months, despite constant reassurances from Kelley.  Harrison says he was promised the machines by January and only received them in May. Both machines arrived without defects and one is operating in East London's Old Street Underground station.  ""It has been a really bad customer experience,"" Harrison said.  Software dissatisfaction  After the long wait for a Robocoin machine, some customers remained dissatisfied with the units. The major source of frustration is Robocoin's software, Harrison and Sargent said.  Harrison said he has been resisting Robocoin's efforts to update his machine's operating system. The new software requires ATM customers to use a Robocoin wallet, but Harrison says this is a form of centralisation that he rejects.  ""They are definitely trying to coerce people into upgrading to this centralised bank 2.0 system, which is not really on. We bought an ATM not a wallet system. We don't like the high pressure we've been put under,"" Harrison said.  Kelley says that operators can ""absolutely"" choose to update their system. He added that updating the system is ""strongly recommended"" because it is more stable and provides a more consistent user experience for users of Robocoin machines. He says that the wallets generated by his machines are ""essential"" to increasing the number of bitcoin users.  ""Is it perfect yet? No. But we believe it is a valuable solution to serve the underbanked and remittance markets,"" Kelley said.  Sargent, meanwhile, said he intended to link his unit to the Canadian exchange Cavirtex. He said he asked whether this would be possible, and was told that it would be. When the machine arrived, however, he found that he couldn't link it to his local exchange. Instead, he found it was hard-coded to conduct trades on Bitstamp.  ""I spent a lot of time working with [Cavirtex],"" he said. ""I told [Robocoin] I was going with that exchange, they said it wasn't an issue at all. When I got the machine, as far as I know, they never gave me an option to change.""  Despite being the first company to launch a bitcoin ATM, Robocoin today trails market leader Lamassu in the number of operational units it has on the market. It is still in second place by a comfortable margin but new entrant BitAccess is gaining on it quickly, according to data from the CoinDesk Bitcoin ATM Map.  Satisfied Robocoin customers  One operator that reports a largely positive experience with Robocoin is Cointrader. The firm used to be known as Bitcoiniacs. It operates the first bitcoin ATM – a Robocoin unit – and was largely responsible for thrusting the ATM-maker into the spotlight, after reporting a transaction volume of CA$1m within a month of launching.  Hugh Halford-Thompson, head of Cointrader's UK operations, where it runs a Robocoin machine in the trendy London neighbourhood of Shoreditch, has a favorable impression of Robocoin and Kelley's customer service.  ""I've been working with them since April, and they've been really good for the business,"" he said.  Halford-Thompson added that delivery of his machine was delayed, but that he expected it for a new product like a bitcoin ATM.  ""It was delayed, but nowhere near that much [compared to MetaLab]. I was expecting it to be delayed a lot more because it's a new product,"" he said.  He added that he was satisfied with Robocoin's new software, even though Robocoin remotely updated the software on his machine several weeks ahead of schedule by accident.  ""I was unsure about it at the start, but it is a far more stable platform. It is more reliable and it works a lot better,"" he said.  Robocoin's mea culpa  Although Kelley responded to MetaLab's Reddit post with defiance with a now-deleted reply, he has now published an unreserved apology on the message board. He told CoinDesk that his first response was a ""judgment error"" that was committed in a moment of high emotion.  ""My intention to share my perspective came across as defensive excuses. Frankly, it did more harm and I wanted a redo,"" he said.  Kelley showed similar contrition in a statement sent to CoinDesk, again apologising to Metalab and ""the bitcoin community"", citing failures in execution and communication on his part. Ultimately, he says, ""Reddit's wrath"" forced him to recognise his mistakes:  ""It should not have taken Reddit’s wrath for me to realize the extent of my mistakes and take long overdue accountability.""",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Joon Ian Wong,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/10/17/robocoin-customers-report-trail-of-late-deliveries-after-reddit-expose,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d7fe54938a288b7a3fd9185b7e122398c75c4090-580x351.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377716,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73BVP,1413574240,AlphaPoint Raises $1.35 Million to Build Intel for Bitcoin,"AlphaPoint has raised $1.35m in new funding to expand its line of digital currency exchange solutions while bringing its products to new international markets.  The funding round included VC firms Ben Franklin Technology Partners and Robin Hood Ventures, as well as notable angel investors such as Invite Mediahttp://www.invitemedia.com/ co-founder Scott Becker and DuckDuckGo CEO Gabriel Weinberg.  Speaking to CoinDesk, AlphaPoint CEO Vadim Telyatnikov framed the funding round as one that will empower his company to help major digital currency exchanges better meet the increasing demands of their large-scale operations, while new entrepreneurs, in turn, will be able to leverage the technology to launch marketplaces in new jurisdictions.  Telyatnikov explained his company's big-picture vision, adding:  ""We see ourselves as the Intel Inside, with our clients marking themselves as their own brands and we're the technology on the back end.""  Becker told CoinDesk that he believes more exchanges will want to outsource the difficult technical components of building and scaling a complex infrastructure, and that this is where AlphaPoint can gain traction in the market.  ""Customers must put a lot of trust in their technical partner – if the technology can't keep up with volume or feature needs, their business can't operate or stay competitive,"" Becker said. ""I would put my trust in AlphaPoint. The AlphaPoint team has already built successful exchange and trading systems in both the finance and online advertising spaces.""  Telyatnikov estimates that AlphaPoint now has roughly a dozen clients all over the world, including major regional bitcoin exchanges such as Canada's Cointrader and Mexico's meXBT.  Building better bitcoin exchanges  AlphaPoint currently offers two products, the AlphaPoint Exchange Platform, which advertises that it can process 1 million digital currency transactions per second; and the AlphaPoint Exchange Remarketer, which connects exchanges for liquidity.  ""If an exchange starts up in Mexico, the buyer can easily pull liquidity from another exchange on the platform or the external exchange that doesn't use our platform,"" Telyatnikov said.  AlphaPoint believes its solutions will appeal to both new and established companies, as entrepreneurs sometimes lack the technical ability to launch sophisticated trading systems. Likewise, it argues that established exchanges may need solutions that allow them to focus on the tasks that come with running a consumer-facing platform.  Telyatnikov believes AlphaPoint is in a unique position to meet the needs of this market given the experience of its team. Founder Joe Ventura, for example, has developed high-speed software systems for financial institutions, including Deutsche Bank, Merrill Lynch and UBS.  Similarly, co-founder and VP of development Jack Sallen brings 15 years of experience in financial services, first working in automated electronic arbitrage on leading derivatives marketplace Chicago Mercantile Exchange.  Falling in love with bitcoin  Telyatnikov boasts a similar depth of experience as the company's founders. Before joining AlphaPoint as its CEO this summer, Telyatnikov founded LiftDNA, a supply side platform focused on ad sales that was later purchased by OpenX. After spending one year with OpenX, however, Telyatnikov left the company for a more entrepreneurial path.  Telyatnikov told CoinDesk that AlphaPoint is not his first bitcoin project, though others never made it passed the planning stages.  ""I left to start a hedge fund,"" Telyatnikov said. ""In August of last year, we started taking a deep look at bitcoin and actually started trading bitcoin, and started to develop a strategy. It worked really well, we were very close to launching our own fund that focused on bitcoin and digital currency, but we decided not to do it and focus on our core strategy.""  Still, Telyatnikov said that in the process he ""fell in love"" with bitcoin and its underlying technology. This passion led him to Inside Bitcoins New York this April, a conference he attended while working on a bitcoin startup with his brother. There, he met Ventura, and afterwards the two forged a new partnership.  Telyatnikov is now confident AlphaPoint is the right platform that can help expand bitcoin use globally, while capitalizing on trends in the market.  ""I think we'll see more and more exchanges, right now depending on what country you're in it's still really hard to get access to bitcoin,"" Telyatnikov said, adding:  ""Through next year and beyond we see more exchanges focused on local countries and our end vision is that anybody no matter where they are in the world, they'll have access to buy digital currency.""

42377714,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73BSt,1413562406,The Blacklist Debate: When is it OK to Meddle with Bitcoin's Code?,"A row that broke out online this month has raised an important question about bitcoin: should people be allowed to code their own rules, and even opinions, into their own versions of the software that runs the network?  The debate kicked off among users of Gentoo – a variant of the Linux operating system that prides itself on being highly configurable to suit different user requirements – when a user reported an issue on the Gentoo bug forum on 5th October.  The version of bitcoind (the official reference client for interacting with the bitcoin network) distributed with Gentoo was blocking particular bitcoin addresses, said the report, meaning that transactions with them wouldn’t work.  The posting showed Gentoo output blocking a transaction with a SatoshiDice address, which had been blacklisted.  “PEBCAK,” replied Luke_Jr (meaning ‘Problem Exists Between Chair And Keyboard'). “No sign anything is actually broken here. Looks like just a troll. Status: INVALID or WORKSFORME?""  And so the firestorm began.  'Spamming' the block chain  Luke_Jr is Luke Dashjr, a developer who runs his own mining pool and has stood for election to the Bitcoin Foundation board. He also maintains software packages for Gentoo and contributes to the bitcoin core development team.  Dashjr had written a patch for Gentoo’s version of bitcoind that specifically blacklisted bitcoin addresses used by several sites, the majority of which were gambling sites: SatoshiDice, BitcoinDice, Satoshibones, and Luckybit. It also blocked addresses operated by Mastercoin, and Counterparty. And the address discussed here as a spam attack on the network was also in the blacklist.  A code listing for the patch can be found here.  Dashjr argued that he hardcoded the blacklist into his patch because sites like SatoshiDice use bitcoin's block chain in a damaging way. SatoshiDice and some other gambling sites use the block chain to return a bet’s result. That creates large numbers of small transactions on the network, which can put it under strain.  In the subsquent discussion on the bug forum, Dashjr called this model a ""DDoS attack on the bitcoin network"". Sites that operate this way make it more expensive to run a bitcoin node by creating transactions as inefficiently as possible, he told CoinDesk. So he included the blacklist in a patch designed to nobble block chain 'spam'.  Dashjr explained:  ""While we do not have a proper fix for this issue yet, most of these can be identified by reusing specific addresses, and so I threw together a quick hack to filter them on that criteria. Obviously this hack is inappropriate for reference code, but it is a simple way to improve the spam filter in production until a better fix is implemented (which may then be proposed as a merge request and later released with the reference code).""  Disclosing changes  Dashjr’s change was a third-party implementation of the bitcoin core code. This contrasts with an ‘upstream’ change to the official reference version of the code, which can only be approved by a few members of the bitcoin core development community. Nevertheless, it provoked a mixed response.  Part of the problem, as suggested by bitcoin core developer Mike Hearn on a bitcoin developer IRC chat, was inadequate disclosure. The patch was turned on by default in the latest update to the software.  Hearn said:  “If they want to distribute a bitcoind with patches like Luke's (which change behaviour in quite some fundamental ways), then they should do a proper upstream fork with a new name, so you are always sure what you're getting.”  Dashjr conceded he could have provided better documentation of what the patch did. When users updated their Gentoo software, they would have seen a message indicating that a patch to bitcoind was being installed, he said, adding:    ""Unfortunately, it appears not all users noticed this, and some even felt deceived. Additionally, I neglected to properly document the option, so other users were unaware that it extended the spam filtering with address matching (in fact, when I was adding the patch to the Gentoo package, I had actually myself forgotten it did).      In the future, I will try to improve documentation and awareness of users to get what they are expecting.""    Dashjr posted a public apology and turned off the patch by default, in addition to separating the spam management part of it out as a separate patch. For some outraged users, all is once again well in Gentoo land.  Deeper questions  However, the discussion raised some interesting questions. Some on the Gentoo bug discussion forum mused that coding a blacklist of addresses into an implementation of bitcoin constitutes censorship, and asked where that would stop, and who would decide what was blacklisted or not.  Is it right to try and code your own rules about how something will work into a version of the bitcoin software?  That depends, said Gregory Maxwell, a member of the bitcoin core development team, explaining:  ""Some parts of bitcoin must agree exactly, bit by bit, in all nodes of the network or the system doesn't work. We call these 'consensus rules', and they cover things like 'is this block valid or not? It’s technically dangerous to the system to have any disagreement or diversity in the consensus rules.""  Other things are simply better if they're well known and mostly uniform, he added, but they don't strictly have to agree. This includes things like what transactions a node will relay.  Maxwell refers to these things as ‘policy’. Some diversity is helpful at this level, he said, because it can protect the network from large scale attack. If too much diversification occurs, it can detract from bitcoin users’ experience. “But diversity here can't break the system,” he emphasised.  Even though Maxwell personally didn't agree with Dashjr’s patch, he pointed out that’s just his opinion. People should be able to run what they like on their bitcoin nodes. After all, bitcoind is distributed under an MIT free-software license that gives developers that capability.  Looking forwards  In future, Dashjr would like to see a variable encoded into Gentoo that allowed different patches with different policies to be installed on the operating system.  He said:  “Such policies would remain patches and not be encoded directly into the reference code (which would itself become a 'vanilla' policy option).""  Dashjr is also working on an extension to bitcoin core that would move all policy decisions to a new 'class'. In the accompanying online discussion for this fork, he argues for having bitcoin nodes with multiple policies.  Mike Hearn takes a harder line on running custom code that validates bitcoin transctions in its own way, arguing that just because a license allows you to do something doesn’t mean that you should:  “Luke pushes this idea of 'policy', but there can be no policy in bitcoin transaction management. If miners or merchants diverge, then the result is payment fraud. That is not an acceptable outcome, seeing as the entire purpose of bitcoin is to block double spending.""  Dashjr argues that it can be dangerous if people modify or reimplement the Bitcoin consensus code, and gives libbitcoin and btcd as examples. He doesn't think that experiments with consensus code should be stopped, as long as people are aware of the dangers.  He doesn't view experiments with policy changes as dangerous, arguing instead that they're beneficial.  ""Policy changes in particular are expected of nodes, especially miners, and the reference code for policy is intentionally kept fairly conservative and not intended for use as-is at all really,” he said.  When recycling is bad  Perhaps they’ll have to agree to disagree, but there’s another issue at stake: reused bitcoin addresses.  Many sites that add material into the block chain, like SatoshiDice, reuse bitcoin addresses, and many developers, Dashjr and Maxwell included, consider this to be a bad thing. After all, reused addresses were what allowed Dashjr to block certain sites.  If an organisation or individual continually reuses a bitcoin address, then it makes them more easily identifiable on the network, and also makes it easier to identify people transacting with them.  That can lead to all kinds of problems, Maxwell warns, including censorship. After all, that’s how Dashjr identified the sites to blacklist in the first place.  If address reuse proliferates among bitcoiners, then censorship by patches like Dashjr’s will be the least of their worries, warns Maxwell.  He explained:  “If people use bitcoin in a lazy, easily censorable way where they are reusing addresses – which were always intended to be one-time in the design of the system – then this creates a serious systemic risk in that someone might try to order nodes, developers, and/or miners to censor the system.”  Educating people and creating better tools is one way to mitigate the issue, Maxwell suggested. But what about Dashjr’s patch blacklist?  ""I can sympathize some with the logic of getting people to fix their vulnerable usage by attacking them,” he concluded. “Maybe it will be effective, but attacking people isn't something I can support.""

42377712,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73BP7,1413560204,Crowdfunding Platform Swarm Announces First Class of Startups,"Decentralized crowdfunding startup Swarm has announced the first class of businesses that will feature on its bitcoin-powered platform.  The crowdfunding platform’s application process saw a number of groups submit applications, with a select few advancing to the video presentation stage. Entrepreneurs hoping to take part in the initiative pitched their projects, all emphasizing the importance of decentralized innovation.  The company now says that five companies and organizations comprise its first class:  Manna – a developer of smart personal drone networks  Coinspace – an operator of a decentralized cryptocurrency workplace  Swarmops – a decentralized organizational management software platform  Judobaby – a decentralized gaming platform  DDP – a “decentralized dance party”  Digital currency-focused publication Bitcoin Magazine will also take part in the inaugural Swarm class.  Leading the way  As Manna’s Eric Smalls noted in his YouTube presentation, decentralized processes represent the future of computing, as embodied in the drone network he and his organization hope to fund via Swarm.  Smalls explained that this approach can enable broader technology adoption, saying:  “We’re really exciting about building an intelligent, personal drone that can do more than one application. What’s interesting is how the mouse changed how people interact with computers, and we already have that with smartphones. We’re now building the second part of that – drones interacting with smartphones – and making that on the Internet and autonomous, instead of human-controlled, enables everyday people to use this technology.”  Swarm’s official 5th November kick-off in Silicon Valley will see the groups demo their projects and initiatives in what the company is calling the world’s first decentralized demonstration.  Decentralized processes  The groups taking part in the launch represent different types of next-generation businesses that take advantage of decentralized structures and processes, according to their developers and creators.  Swarmops creator and Swedish Pirate Party founder Rick Falkvinge explained in his video that his project came out of that political group’s efforts to create power structures that drew their authority from decentralization.  By breaking this process down and platforming it in a decentralized software format, Falkvinge argued, you can remove bureacratic headaches entirely and create a more engaging governmental process.  He explained that the inclusion of digital currency technology makes the process that much more trustworthy, saying:  “When you add bitcoin into this, the process of automatic accounting goes electric.”  Sol Lederer of Coinspace said that he wants to use his decentralized workspace concept to help cryptocurrency businesses take root in an inclusive, proactive environment. Doing so, he argued, will enable this unique class of startups to foster and grow, and that this also means using cryptocurrencies as a financial tool.  He said:  “This whole operation, we decided, will not use fiat at all. We want to showcase a place where only crypto is used. We want to be a model.”  Lederer added that Coinspace will develop its own cryptocurrency to help facilitate operations, and that bitcoin or other digital currencies will be used to pay salaries, manage accounting and facilitating other financial processes at the workspace.  Making cryptos fun  Outside of government and business structures that operate on the basis of decentralization, Swarm is supporting projects that aim to bring these principles to the areas of recreation, entertainment and culture.  DDP has thrown several crypto-themed parties and took part in the most recent Camp Dogecoin at the annual Burning Man music festival in Nevada. According to its official website, the group hopes to promote greater social consciousness by creating inclusive environments for fun and recreation.  The DDP manifesto states:  “The prime objective at a DDP is celebrating life, enjoying music and connecting with complete strangers on a deep and fundamental level – not getting drunk and being an idiot. Partying by elevating consciousness, rather than destroying it.”  When discussing Camp Dogecoin earlier this year, creator Gary Lachance told CoinDesk that the nature of dogecoin makes it an ideal vehicle for connecting with a broader audience in a decentralized, open way.  Judobaby  is the force behind a number of family-friendly video games, including Jerry Rice and Nitus’ Dog Football – a 2011 game for the Wii that received favorable reviews for its unique concept and style. The company hopes to leverage its participation in the first Swarm class to expand its existing content base and develop new projects.  According to Dan Mueller  , the firm's co-founder, small businesses like his have a real need for platforms that enable simple crowdfunding mechanisms.  “We think Swarm is going to be one of the front runners in that,"" he said.

The company said it was ""appalled"" by what happened, describing the seizure of its ATM as ""collateral damage"" in the war on gang crime.  Bit2Bit went on record to state the following:    ""The arrested individual has no relationship to Bit2Bit Holdings Pty Ltd. He is not a shareholder, either directly, or indirectly.      Rouge Coffee, and The Roastery Cafe do not own, or operate the ATM. The ATM is the sole property of Bit2Bit and is operated by us.    The ATM does not allow large volume transactions.    Bit2Bit's staff have been instructed to cooperate fully with any legal requests they get from the police.""    The company pointed out criminals cannot hide behind bitcoin's supposed veil of anonymity and expressed a hope that the ATM will soon be up and running again.      Australian police have raided a Brisbane coffee shop with ties to a biker gang, seizing a bitcoin ATM in the process.  Police suspected the gang, which goes by the name of the Bandidos, was involved in high-level drug trafficking – allegedly trafficking meth and cocaine, as well as dealing in controlled substances used in the production of certain drugs.  The raid, which was the culmination of a two-year drug investigation, was one of a series of 19 raids across Brisbane, Logan, Cairns, Ipswich and the Gold Coast.  The police operation, codenamed 'Juliet Wave', also resulted in the seizure of $2.6m-worth of drugs. A total of 61 people being charged in connection with the case so far.  The investigation was spearheaded by Taskforce Maxima, a squad formed specifically to tackle crimes involving motorcycle gangs.  Bandido ATM?  The bitcoin ATM was seized from the Roastery Cafe in South Brisbane, along with delivery vans and other objects of police interest.  Brent Carall, the proprietor of the cafe, and alleged senior member of the gang Senad Ćatić have been arrested, reports the Brisbane Times.  The seized machine, which was Queensland's first bitcoin ATM, is now in the process of being forensically investigated, according to Taskforce Maxima superintendent Mick Niland.  It remains to be established whether the ATM was indeed employed by gang members as part of their drug trafficking network.  Global operations  The Bandidos are a 'one percenter’ motorcycle gang with more than 200 chapters around the world.  Their operations in Australia are said to be extensive, with chapters located in Brisbane, Adelaide, Melbourne and more than a dozen other smaller towns and regions.  Superintendent Niland said the gang was targeted because it represents a ""significant risk"" to the Queensland community and described the Bandidos operation as a ""highly sophisticated and exclusive drug network"" operated by high-end criminals.

With the Netscape anniversary in mind, Andreessen told Chang that he anticipates more change in the payments space in the next five years than there has been in the previous 20, and that there would be two major drivers of that change: Apple Pay and bitcoin.  “What we say from our [Andreessen Horowitz’s] standpoint is that, in the long run, bitcoin is by far the most innovative and radical thing,” he said, adding:  “It’s the thing that will actually have a big impact over 20 years, but Apple Pay is the thing that’s going to have a big impact in the next three years. And the combination of those two is going to cause enormous change.”  The chicken-and-egg problem  Apple CEO Tim Cook introduced ApplePay last month, describing it as an “entirely new payments solution"". Andreessen, however, diplomatically asserted that it is anything but that:  “[Apply Pay] is innovative, but in a way [it's] very consistent with the status quo. If anything, its big selling point is it doesn't require massive structural change.”  He went on to describe the dilemma that exists in today’s payments industry, maintaining that there is a network effects problem in that no one will use a new payments system until both the merchant and consumer sides of the industry embrace it fully.  “You have to get through the chicken-and-egg problem to get to the other side of universal adoption. Apple Pay is very cleverly calibrated to skip right through that […] It sort of plugs right into the existing system.”  Bitcoin is different. It’s the exact inverse of Apple Pay, according to Andreessen, but because of the same chicken-and-egg scenario, larger transaction volumes could be a long way off:  ""Bitcoin is truly radical, Cryptocurrency, more broadly, is a truly radical, truly revolutionary, fundamental breakthrough in computer science, completely different way to do transaction processing, potentially a replacement for a very large amount of the status quo, but has the big chicken-and-egg challenge.”  Betting on bitcoin  Venture capital isn’t a batting-average business, Andreessen went on, but rather a ""slugging-percentage"" business. He remains open to the prospect that bitcoin may or may not work. For every 10 bets he takes on startups, he assumes he’ll lose five – a typically venture capitalist approach to take.  “It’s not a question of how often you’re right,” he said. “It’s a question of when you’re right – how right are you?”  Andreessen added:  “I would put bitcoin squarely in that kind of bet. I’m completely enthusiastic to take that – that’s a classic venture capital risk to take. People who understand that risk should feel very good about taking it.”  Andreessen Horowitz, he estimated, has invested almost $50m in bitcoin companies to date – including Coinbase and TradeBlock – and is actively searching for more bitcoin-focused opportunities.  Rounding off the talk, Andreessen declared his confidence in the concept of cryptocurrency and the likelihood that it would become “vitally important”.  He concluded:  “I think it will be in the form of bitcoin, but, even if it’s not bitcoin, it will be something else. Even if it’s not this year, it will be five years or 10 years. It will happen, and it will be a very big deal. From that standpoint I both do care what happens in the short term, since we have to live in the short term, but I also have tremendous faith in what’s going to happen in the long run.”",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE,Tanaya Macheel,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/10/17/why-marc-andreessen-is-long-on-bitcoin-and-short-on-apple-pay,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8cae5d77ef93179359ba8af5ef1046fc21a809fb-1424x787.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377718,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73BXv,1413505559,Digital Rights Advocacy Group Launches Campaign Against BitLicense,"Digital rights advocacy group the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is supporting privacy, free speech and innovation through a new email campaign opposing New York's proposed BitLicense.  The EFF has crafted a pre-written letter for supporters to sign and send to the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) and its leading supervisor, Superintendent Ben Lawsky. The letter argues that premature regulation stifles innovation, and that because of this, the BitLicense could adversely affect the bitcoin and digital currency industry should it pass in current form.  However, the EFF mostly asserts the consequences the passage of the law could have for society at large – not just bitcoin businesses and users.  In a post to the EFF blog yesterday, activism director Rainey Reitman expounded on the ways the BitLicense affects everyone’s financial privacy, writing:  “The NYDFS is letting the fear of money laundering drive a massive regulatory proposal forward that would affect users who are doing nothing wrong. NYDFS should respect the privacy of technology users, and limit its regulation to what is proportionate to the real threat at hand.”  The EFF is a non-profit civil liberties organisation that works on technology issues and began following bitcoin in 2011 because of its potential as a cash-like solution for digital payments.  Regulation bigger than bitcoin  Speaking to CoinDesk, Reitman emphasized the larger implications of the BitLicense, arguing that, regardless of any regulatory body's view on bitcoin, the BitLicense is problematic because it could be applied more widely to other innovations.  “We really don't know what tools will be built on the bitcoin protocol for years to come, and the proposal that the NYDFS has put forward doesn't have any carve-outs for non-financial services that are using the bitcoin protocol,"" Reitman said.  Reitman wrote that people affected by the BitLicense proposal fall into two groups: those who will require a BitLicense and those who don’t but may still be affected by it.  Although the law wouldn't affect digital currency users specifically, it would mandate affected companies keep 10-year records on all parties in each transaction, including the amount, date and time of the transactions as well as the total amount feed and charged to or on behalf of the licensee.  Reitman argues that digital currencies like bitcoin endeavor to “recreate some of the censorship-resistant and privacy-protecting attributes of cash”. However, the records each licensee will be required to keep would also include such personal data and identity information as the full names of the transaction parties, account numbers and physical addresses.  “This would, in effect, threaten the possibility of having any cash-like interactions in the digital world,” she said.  Exemptions not guaranteed  In the interview, Reitman also cautioned that certain groups within the bitcoin community should not be so confident that they might be exempt from the regulation, citing Superintendent Lawsky’s most recent remarks from Tuesday.  At the time, Lawsky expanded on the intent behind the BitLicense law, asserting that he would ensure bitcoin miners and software developers would be unaffected by the BitLicense in the next draft of the regulation.  Still, Reitman warned that members of the bitcoin community should not be “lulled” by his statements.  “We don't know what’s in the next draft of the regulation until we read the next draft of the regulation,"" Reitman said. ""What’s important is what ends up in the final versions and right now there are no good protections for software developers or frankly for miners. I think there’s enough wiggle room in the current version that miners should be concerned.”  Public show of support  Bitcoin Foundation chief scientist Gavin Andresen took to Twitter today to promote the letter campaign in one sign that the EFF's initiative has had a larger impact on the digital currency community.    The new BitLicense would force Bitcoin services to spy on their customers. Help stop it: https://t.co/2Ah70xXZNE via @eff      — Gavin Andresen (@gavinandresen) October 16, 2014      Andresen has a history collaborating with EFF. The organisation began accepting bitcoin in January 2011, later suspended that option and reintroduced bitcoin payments in May 2013.  The EFF spent some time analyzing bitcoin during its break from the technology. In that time, it returned all the bitcoin it had previously received to the bitcoin community through Andresen.  Broad criticism for BitLicense  The EFF initiative is also the latest sign that the BitLicense proposal has garnered criticism beyond the bitcoin and digital currency community.  In its formal remarks, the EFF cited a similar stance voiced by the Center for Democracy & Technology (CDT), which spoke out against the proposal this September. The non-profit, which seeks to maintain the user-controlled nature of the Internet, wrote at the time that the BitLicense threatens broader online privacy and innovation.  With their statements, the EFF and the CDT join a chorus of bitcoin companies that have issued public statements opposing the law, including Coinbase, Circle and Xapo.
