The resulting crackdown could force the closure of 201 listed startups, according to national media.  The law, passed in 2018 but only recently enforced, targets crowdfunding and electronic payments services. Over 57% of themhttps://www.endeavor.org.mx/sala-de-prensa/santander-presenta-el-termometro-fintech-los-retos-de-la-regulacion are currently battling against time to obtain permission to do business from the National Banking and Securities Commission (CNBV).  One of the biggest barriers for entrepreneurs are the high costs required for compliance, which can reach well over $35,000. The law also demands businesses to have a minimum annual profit of $100,000, some thing few startups can achieve.  The entrepreneurs are also subject to a cryptocurrency ban. A recent version of the regulation banned fintechs from exchanging, transmitting, and holding crypto.  The Struggle With Crypto  Mexico's regulators'  initial attempts at managing cryptocurrencies have changed drastically since it began the regulation process, according to Josu San Martin, Ex-Director at the Secretary of Finance and Former Director of Fintech México.  “The bar was set too high. At first they were aiming for an open, inclusive regulation. At the end, the law came out very restrictive, especially for cryptocurrencies to the point where an exchange can't work under the Mexican law,” San Martin said.  At the same time, the high costs of regulation pushed entrepreneurs to raise funds quickly, with many of them resorting to ICOs, according to Alberto Navarro, CCO of Lumit, a blockchain consultant.  ""Usually the first thing they ask us for is to create a cryptocurrency to raise funds with, which comes with a very high legal risk,"" Contreras said.  Moving Forward  Nonetheless, bitcoin adoption isn't slowing down. Bitso, Mexico's biggest exchange, became the first to obtain a license to operate in the country and now works with nearly 700,000 bitcoin customers.  According to Pablo Gonzalez, Bitso Chairman and Co-Founder, the popularity of cryptocurrencies stems from the general distrust of banks in Mexico, making his service a necessity.  ""Here we have more people using cryptocurrencies than equities. I think that's why a Fintech Law was created in the first place,"" Gonzalez said.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Diana Aguilar,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/08/05/experts-say-mexicos-regulations-raise-the-bar-too-high-for-crypto-entrepreneurs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/53aef9cdbe997c384f00e72f1ab9f22343dce5ec-900x600.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to Israeli business media Globes, Arad is suing partners and brothers Uriel and Daniel Peled, Orbs, Cointree Management Microverse, Hexa Labs, and Hexa Solutions following a failed 18-month mediation in a Tel Aviv court. Arad claims the brothers committed “conspiracy, deceit and serious fraud, as well as unlawful enrichment.” The official report accuses the brothers of breach of fiduciary duty, oppression of a minority shareholder, breach of contract and breach of commitments, theft of commercial secrets, and negligence.  Initial reports suggest that the lawsuit could reach into the tens of millions of dollars as Arad is demanding a settlement from the Elad brothers' 12 separate digital currency offerings including Leadcoin, Kin, Orbs, Sirin, and Stox.  Arad claims the brothers allocated his Cointree Capital shares towards Hexa, a non-profit blockchain foundation. From the lawsuit:  ""The respondents (the Peled brothers) exploited Cointree Capital's business opportunities to set up new companies based upon new opportunities in the new world of virtual currencies, as well as ideas and plans of Cointree Capital.""  Orbs first launched in 2017 with an initial coin offering following in May 2018. It raised $118 million. A $15 million investment followed in December from Korean firm Kakao Investments.  Interestingly, transactions between Orbs and two recent and large ICO's Kik and Sirin Labs are listed. Arad claims he was the contact point between Kik and the Peled brothers before they cut him off. Currently, Kik is under fire from the SEC for an unregistered securities offering. Earlier this year, Sirin Labs CEO Moshe Hogeg was given two months by an Israeli judge to settle an investment misappropriation charge by a Chinese investor. The current connection between Kik, Sirin Labs, and Orbs is unspecified.  Responding to the suit, Orbs says the claimant's demands are unremarkable. ""We have not yet managed to study the claim documents, which were sent to us at the same time as they were distributed to the press and media,"" they wrote. ""Unfortunately, the statement of claim did not surprise us, and follows previous attempts and threats on the part of the claimant.""  As initially reported by CoinDesk in June, Orbs was invited by White House advisor Jared Kushner to discuss prospective blockchain solutions for aid distribution in the Palestinian territories.

42382451,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rlkb,1565037644,Former Polychain Partner Ryan Zurrer Is Leaving Web3 to Start a DAO,"Nothing has ever excited former Polychain partner and Web3 Foundation executive Ryan Zurrer like The DAO – the 2016 project whose eventual loss of millions of dollars in ETH caused a fork of the ethereum blockchain.  In fact, Zurrer believes in the concept so much, he's leaving the Web3 Foundation in order to take another shot at creating a big, for-profit, decentralized company that (at least for now) will also be called The DAO.  ""With the success of the DOT sale, the success of the Web3 Summit and the Web3 Foundation in a strong position organizationally, it’s an appropriate time to step away. I will migrate and go back to what my primary passion is – deploying capital and helping early-stage teams build new concepts in the space,"" Zurrer told CoinDesk in a statement.  The Web3 Foundation confirmed his departure to CoinDesk, telling CoinDesk that it is not involved with the new DAO project.  Zurrer said that further announcements about those partnering with him will be made at the Web3 Summit later this month.  A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is able to function without a specific CEO or leader because its rules are enforced by code that governs all of its operations. The idea of the original DAO was that people could contribute funds to the DAO in exchange for voting tokens. They would then use those tokens to decide how to invest the shared pool of funds.  ""The original DAO was a clean, pseudonymous capital pool,"" Zurrer told CoinDesk in a phone call, emphasizing its design such that participants could get in and get out of their investment at any time.  Said Zurrer:  ""This is the closest attempt we've seen anywhere in the space to the ideals of that original DAO.""  New model  Zurrer shared a draft of the new DAO's white paper, currently posted on his GitHub page.  Those who join the DAO will be given DAO tokens. In order to simplify governance, they will only be asked to vote under intervals called ""mandates,"" after a set of projects have been determined by underlying leagues, described below. The white paper defines a number of principles that will govern its operations, such as clean capital, value creation and security.  One key innovation of the new version of the DAO appears to be that it builds in a variety of checks and balances into the new system. Any expenditures made under the new DAO will require sign off by three groups in its multi-signature architecture.  The three groups (called ""leagues"") are divided into venture, treasury, dev and compliance. Venture manages deal flow and vetting of potential investments.  Treasury is responsible for the DAO's portfolio of investments, depending on which assets it accepts as contributions (such as ETH, WBTC and ERC-20 tokens).  Compliance verifies that all decisions made by the other two are correct and align with the DAO's principles. It will also narrow down proposals before they are presented to all token holders for a final vote.  Bearing in mind the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's specific evaluation of The DAO following its unraveling, the white paper specifically addresses the issue of regulatory compliance:  ""At the time of conceptualizing the DAO, most of the authors of this specification are optimistic that work can be done by a well-intentioned competent Compliance League to achieve reasonable compliance without sacrificing the principles above, namely that the DAO remains a 'clean capital' pool that participants can freely enter into and leave from reasonably without discrimination.""  Dev is another league, not a signatory to expenditures, but it would provide due diligence on acquisitions, build out tools for all projects to use and update the DAO's architecture.  The white paper also presents a league called the ""original guild,"" which serves as a sort of backstop against bad actors, with power only to freeze the DAO if deemed necessary.  Updated technology  The new version of the DAO draws on work from Aragon, such as its new iteration on the DAICO concept for fundraising, and work by Protocol Labs, tracking contributions made by distributed participants.  Zurrer said, ""It uses a bunch of kind of new and elegant mechanism design that we are pretty excited about.""  While he hopes to be able to announce participation by other organizations soon, he noted that many are likely to remain anonymous. ""One of us had to make the announcement though and since I've been involved with the genesis of this DAO, I'm taking it,"" he said.  The white paper concludes:  ""We find the dream of a sustainable decentralized organization that attracts and filters for great talent, supports genuine innovation and meaningful experimentation, and delivers outlier value to its members to be so prescient that we are compelled to forge ahead with development and eventual deployment because this is the most interesting project we can imagine to be a member of.""

42382460,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rltP,1565022314,Tezos Co-Creator Commits to Donating Millions in Future XTZ Proceeds,"The Takeaway:  When the $232 million Tezos token sale took place, a Tezos Foundation was created to launch the protocol. It also committed to purchase the company that created it, Dynamic Ledger Solutions, founded by Arthur and Kathleen Breitman.  Now, Kathleen Breitman has signed a binding commitment with Founders Pledge to give 15 percent of her portion of the proceeds of that sale to charity, CoinDesk has confirmed.  It will be at least four years until Breitman has access to the full proceeds, so the ultimate value of her commitment ultimately depends on the performance of XTZ and cryptocurrencies contributed in the sale.  Estimating a present value for the commitment is complicated by ongoing legal disputes around the Tezos ICO, but if the sale had been consummated already, the value of Arthur and Kathleen Breitman's XTZ together would be $97 million.      The first thing Kathleen Breitman wants you to know is that she doesn't hold any XTZ yet. But when she does, she's giving away 15 percent of her share to charity.  Breitman, one of the co-founders of the Tezos blockchain, has signed a binding commitment with Founders Pledge to donate a portion of her initial coin offering (ICO) proceeds. Tezos raised $232 million in mid-2017 in what was the largest ICO at the time. Breitman says she's in no rush to cash out. Her eventual gifts should amount to millions of dollars, though, that depends on how Tezos and crypto perform in the next few years.  ""I haven't exercised the put option for Tezos yet, but I have signed the pledge,"" Breitman told CoinDesk. ""I think a lot more founders in the space should consider doing this.""  How lucrative the pledge may end up being is still to be determined, however.  Per the terms of the Tezos fundraising documents, the Tezos Foundation has committed to acquire the company that Breitman owns in part, Dynamic Ledger Solutions (DLS), though it will not pay the full price till a full four years have passed and the Tezos blockchain has met certain performance criteria.  If the acquisition had simply happened on the day the sale closed, the Breitmans would have earned approximately $17.7 million from the proceeds alone, plus roughly 68 million XTZ, which would be worth approximately $97 million at today's prices. The Breitmans own 90 percent of DLS, Kathleen told CoinDesk.  It is not known whether the contract calls for them to be paid in a percentage of the bitcoin and ether from the sale or in the spot value of those assets in dollars. As of now, Kathleen is the only member of the Breitman family that has made a commitment to Founders Pledge.  Regardless, Breitman has committed to giving 15 percent of her earnings from that sale.  ""I also liked the idea of credible commitments, because that's part of why blockchains are powerful,"" she said.  Breitman's causes  Founders Pledge aims to get as many entrepreneurs as possible to commit a part of their potential exit winnings to charitable purposes.  Late last year, forecasters projected that 2019 alone could see $200 billion in initial public offerings.  ""We're thrilled about Kathleen making this meaningful commitment to do good and joining the Founders Pledge community,"" Founders Pledge President Matt Hunter told CoinDesk. ""We're currently working on some big things for crypto investors and entrepreneurs which we can't talk about just yet, but we're very excited.""  Breitman tells CoinDesk she has appreciated joining the community of founders who have also taken the pledge. She likes the way fellow founders think about engaging with social change.  ""Obviously you start a company because you want to solve a problem,"" Breitman explained. ""That attitude carrying over to a charitable environment makes for really compelling conversations.""  She's still thinking about where she might put her commitment. ""I don't have to decide until I actually do it,"" Breitman said. She says she volunteered at youth services non-profit Covenant House in college and she still values their work.  ""I [also] think there's a lot of interesting progress going on in different disease categories,"" she added.  More crypto donors  CoinDesk has also confirmed that Joey Krug, one of the key creators of Augur, now at Pantera Capital, has also signed the Founders Pledge.  Krug's commitment is a little more open-ended. He plans to give 5 percent of his next exit on whatever the next company he founds ends up being. It's not clear what that will be or when, however. ""It's kind of just a no-brainer,"" Krug told CoinDesk.  As a member of the team at Pantera, he's also helped Founders Pledge get introduced to the new startup leaders he's backed. Kathleen noted that there's been talk of social good efforts in crypto, but it still tends to be a bit inwardly focused.  ""I think a lot of the cryptocurrency stuff is more centered around making cryptocurrencies an action of charity,"" Breitman said. ""I think for efficacy, my personal philosophy would be like: Hey, to whom much is given, it's better to do something more helpful in the short term""  Breitman said that she wants to ""target things where money can be spent more immediately and less moonshot-y stuff, since that is how I would define my day job.""  Krug is following a fairly similar approach. He expects he'll give about half of his eventual exit to known non-profits with a good track record of preventing death, disease or disability (such as the Malaria Foundation). He'll probably also give half to some kind of neglected basic research.  For example, Krug noted that every time the energy density of batteries leaps forward, it has broad ramifications for social good, but not a lot of people invest in fundamental battery research.  ""That kind of stuff I think is interesting to me, things that people are overlooking,"" Krug said.  Krug is currently the co-chief investment officer at Pantera Capital.  Since finishing her efforts to help the Tezos Foundation launch the blockchain, Breitman has been at work on a gaming company that will use Tezos infrastructure.  Coinbase co-founder Brian Armstrong has also signed the Giving Pledge, a similar commitment but for billionaires such as Warren Buffett, MacKenzie Bezos and Pierre Omidyar.

According to a report on Econonews, a local financial website, Terra has agreed to work with Sinsang Market, a company that links vendors at Seoul’s Dongdaemun fashion market with customers in Korea and elsewhere in the world.  The two will develop a payments system to offer end-to-end capabilities for wholesale transactions, including payments, settlement and delivery. It will utilize CHAI, a South Korean mobile payments platform powered by Terra's blockchain technology.  Dongdaemun fashion market is one of the largest fashion wholesale markets globally, with an estimated $12 billion of turnover but at present it remains fragmented and relative poorly developed in terms of logistics and payment services. The hope is to connect the many small enterprises operating there more efficiently with their target markets.  According to other local press reports, Sinsang Market works with 18,000 wholesalers carrying 28 million products.  One of Terra's core strategies is to build an alliance of ecommerce sites and operate as a payment platform for them. The Terra coin may also be offered as an incentive for those making purchases on these sites.  Terra has approximately 25 such relationships already. The list of partners includes: South Korea’s TMON, also known as TicketMonster; The Galleria, a Gangman K-fashion mall; Qoo10, a Singapore-based online marketplace which claims to be the largest of its kind in the world; and Carousell, a Singapore-based online retailer.

Speaking to the Bangkok Post, Police Major General Preecha Charoensahayanon, secretary-general of the Anti-Money Laundering Office (Amlo), said he believes that, while currently not an issue, cryptocurrency ""will be a tool of new money laundering.""  Preecha said that Amlo currently does not receive complaints around money laundering involving cryptocurrencies, but warned:  ""We may not find any clue, but that doesn't mean the wrongdoing does not occur.""  The secretary-general argued that criminals will increasingly turn to digital assets to conceal their ill-gotten proceeds.  To prepare for this shift, he told the Bangkok Post he plans to alter the country's laws to bring cryptos into the AML regime, starting with the Anti-Money Laundering Act.  Preecha indicated would add a rule requiring cryptocurrency exchange platforms to report activities to the Amlo, adding that such information is crucial to track laundered money over the internet.  The legal changes would corresponds with international standards on crypto exchange service providers, he said.  Thailand is a member nation of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) – an international money-laundering watchdog – which recently issued recommendations that cryptocurrency platforms monitor and report suspicious transactions.  It also included a controversial requirement that “virtual asset service providers” (VASPs), including crypto exchanges, pass information about their customers to one another when transferring funds between firms.

42403126,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdeoJ3,1565006435,"Lenovo, Glaxo, Nokia: Big Names Join New IBM Blockchain","IBM has launched a new blockchain project called Trust Your Supplier (TYS), with big name firms Anheuser-Busch InBev, GlaxoSmithKline, Lenovo, Nokia, Schneider Electric and Vodafone already on board.  Announced Monday, TYS joins IBM’s successful stable of track-and-trace supply chain and logistics blockchain consortia, which include Food Trust and TradeLens.  TYS is focused on supplier onboarding, an umbrella term relating to a wide and varied assortment of supplier information like ISO certifications, bank account data, tax certifications, certificates of insurance and other supplier data required for exchanging purchase orders and invoices.  Marie Wieck, general manager at IBM Blockchain, told CoinDesk:  “That onboarding cycle is typically very manual in many companies, even those with very efficient supply chains, just in terms of the vetting and validation of those suppliers. Getting a new supplier on-boarded quickly, particularly when there are new capabilities coming up every day, is critical to how rapidly you introduce new products and services.”  Renee Ure, chief supply chain officer for Lenovo’s data center group, echoed this in a statement, saying, “Through Trust Your Supplier, both buyers and suppliers will see the procurement benefits of blockchain through reductions in cost, complexity and speed.”  Stepping back, enterprise blockchain projects have a reputation for moving forward at a glacial pace, plodding from proof-of-concept to pilot and finally (if you’re lucky) to live production.  However, in this case, IBM has emerged with a fully formed live production blockchain.  Big Blue started work on the project internally with its own procurement division and is using the blockchain to manage 4,000 of its own 18,500 suppliers. IBM said it expects to see a 70–80 percent reduction in the cycle time to onboard new suppliers, with a potential 50 percent reduction in administrative costs within its own business.  TYS is currently limited to the existing participants, with plans for commercial availability in Q3 of this year. Wieck said that, for now, its footprint is confined to North America, but the intention is for a global network.  Network of networks  A key innovation at the heart of TYS is a “digital passport” for supplier identity.  One of IBM’s early blockchain partners, Chainyard, which also builds on Hyperledger Fabric, helped design this aspect of the project. Third-party validators such as Dun & Bradstreet, Ecovadis and RapidRatings provide outside verification or audit capabilities for suppliers via the passport.  Wieck said the digital passport is specifically tailored to TYS, but like most things IBM does, it has been created with pluggable open interfaces in mind.  As such, some facets of TYS could also be applicable to TradeLens, IBM’s shipping cargo blockchain ecosystem launched with Maersk back in 2018. Wieck said there are a number of document-sharing use cases that could be extended with the TYS supplier network.  She said TradeLens, for example, is working on optimizing invoice settlement, factoring and invoice dispute resolution.  Wieck explained:  “We have been talking about the notion of interoperability between blockchain networks – the idea of a network of networks which can expand these economies.”  Marie Wieck General Manager, IBM Blockchain IBM Corporation via CoinDesk archives",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/08/05/lenovo-glaxo-nokia-big-names-join-new-ibm-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cc89fa26b4d409527fcda49fd409300ade2eb6eb-2538x1544.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The rise in bitcoin's dominance rate to the highest level in over two years indicates the price rise is sustainable.  A UTC close above $12,030 would confirm the falling channel breakout and allow a rally to $13,880 (June 26 high).  The bull case would weaken if BTC closes today (UTC) below $11,120, although that looks unlikely.  Bitcoin (BTC) is eyeing a move to key resistance above $12,000, having broken out of a bearish pattern in the Asian trading hours today.  The leading cryptocurrency jumped above $11,120 at 00:45 UTC, violating the bearish lower-highs pattern created on July 20 and extended gains to $11,868 at 07:30 UTC. That's BTC's highest level since July 12, according to Bitstamp data.  With the price rise, BTC's dominance rate – the cryptocurrency's share of the total crypto market – has jumped to 67.9 percent, the highest level since April 12, 2017, according to CoinMarketCap.  Many observers consider price gains sustainable if they are backed by an uptick in the dominance rate.  For instance, Vinny Lingham, co-founder & CEO of identity protection and management startup Civic, put out a series of tweets on April 10, explaining how alternative cryptocurrencies decoupling from the BTC rally would be a sign of substance in the bull run.  With the dominance rate validating BTC's 9.5 percent price rise in the last 24 hours, further gains toward resistance at $12,030 look likely. Technical indicators are also signaling a continuation of the price rise.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $11,710 on Bitstamp.  Daily and hourly charts  BTC's move above the bearish lower-high of $11,120 (above left) is backed by a bullish above-50 reading on the relative strength index (RSI). Further, the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram continues to gain altitude, another sign of strengthening bullish momentum.  What's more, BTC has found acceptance above the 50-day moving average (MA). Also, the 5- and 10-day MAs are trending north, indicating a bullish setup.  As a result, a rise to the upper edge of the 1.5-month-long falling channel, currently at $12,030 looks likely. Supporting the bullish case is a pickup in the buying volumes (green bars), as seen on the hourly chart (above right).  A high-volume UTC close above $12,030 would confirm the channel breakout and open the doors to a retest of $13,880 (June 26 high).  The bullish case would weaken if BTC prints a UTC close below $11,120 today, leaving a daily candle with a long upper wick in its wake – a sign of buyer exhaustion.  That, however, looks unlikely, unless China's yuan recovers lost ground.  It is worth noting that China's offshore Yuan exchange rate (CNH) fell from 6.97 yuan per U.S. dollar to a multi-year low of 7.1085 per USD in the 60 minutes to 02:00 UTC today.  Meanwhile, BTC picked up a bid around $10,980 at 00:00 UTC – an hour before CNH began falling against the dollar, as seen in the chart below.  The price action seems to have convinced the crypto market community that yuan's drop below the major psychological level of 7 per USD fueled a rally in BTC's price – that is, wealthy Chinese investors rotated money into BTC amid the yuan's depreciation.  Some observers, including prominent analyst Alex Kruger, wondered earlier today whether BTC had front-run the People's Bank of China's (central bank) decision to allow the yuan to slide beyond 7 per USD.  If that narrative continues to strengthen, then BTC may become vulnerable to a bounce, in yuan, if any. However, as of now, the yuan is showing little sign of life, currently trading at 7.08 per USD.

42403131,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdeoMz,1565000405,Litecoin Just Halved Its Crypto Rewards for Miners,"Litecoin (LTC), currently the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has just reduced its block reward for miners by half.  The litecoin blockchain reached the trigger block height of 1,680,000 at 10:16 UTC on Monday, according to the litecoin explorer from mining pool operator BTC.com.  The event marks a major threshold for miners, as the litecoin network is designed to reduce its mining rewards by half every 840,000 blocks (roughly every four years).  For this ""halving,"" the mining reward for every block has been reduced from the previous 25 LTC to 12.5 LTC.  Given the block production time on the litecoin network is around one block every 2.5 minutes, roughly 576 blocks are produced in every 24 hours with a new supply of 7,200 LTC entering into the market – half the previous daily level of around 14,400 LTC.  As of press time, about 63 million out of the total issuance of 84 million LTC are effectively in circulation, leaving about 21 million LTC block mining rewards – worth $2 billion at today's prices – available for miners to compete for in the future.  Since early this year, LTC's price has seen a significant uptick from around $30 in January to as much as $120 in June, but has since then decreased to around $100.  In line with the price increase ahead of the anticipated halving event, hash rate computing on the litecoin network and the mining difficulty have both jumped by 200 percent since end of December 2019.    The halving will likely have an affect on the interest in mining participation, as several widely used litecoin mining devices will now have a tough time generating enough LTC to offset electricity costs.      According to a miner profit index from f2pool, one of the world's largest mining pools by hash rate, the three most profitable LTC miners made by InnoSilicon andFusionSilicon X6 had a profit margin of between 55 and 60 percent before Aug. 5.      Other older models such as Bitmain’s AntMiner L3, however, already had a profitability that was less than 50 percent based on an electricity cost of $0.04 per kWh and LTC’s price before the halving.      Holding everything else constant, reducing the mining revenue by half could lead to a net loss for miners with such older models, as Shixing Mao, co-founder of f2pool, said in a Weibo post:      “With an electricity cost of 0.26 yuan [$0.037] per kWh, miners like L3+ can pretty much just shut down tonight.”            Litecoin mining image via Shutterstock",NEUTRAL,LTC,BUSINESS | LTC | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Wolfie Zhao,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/08/05/litecoin-just-halved-its-crypto-rewards-for-miners,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a54ca839139b8c975bb6f9140ef433cb4aed85b4-1500x950.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

As reported by local news source PressTV, the country's cabinet ratified the bill on Sunday, approving legislation that will formally create a new industry of cryptocurrency mining, as was expected.  Mining will be allowed inside Iran as long as participant adhere to conditions listed in the bill, including obtaining industry ministry approval. Mining centres must also not be sited within a 30-kilometer (approximately 19-mile) range of all towns except the capital Tehran and major city of Esfahan where tougher restrictions will be applied, the report says.  Regarding devices used for mining, crypto miners must observe rules laid out by Iran’s standardization and communications authorities.  Mining firms also face fees on the energy used as part of the mining process, and will be charged for electricity, or natural gas that can be used to generate electricity, at the same prices as energy exports from the country, the bill reportedly says.  Miners will be taxed at the same level as industrial manufacturing firms, with exemptions for firms exporting mined cryptocurrencies and returning the revenue back to Iran’s economy.  The bill also notably lifts the illegal status of cryptocurrencies in Iran, although it stresses that trades made with cryptocurrencies in the nation are not recognized as lawful.  Further, cryptos will not be recognized as legal tender and the Iranian central bank will not guarantee their value.  The move has been prompted by Iran's increasing popularity with crypto miners due to its cheap power. The country is also reportedly eyeing the use of cryptocurrencies as a means to circumvent international sanctions.

42403119,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdeoD9,1564992009,"Cryptocurrency in China: Over the Counter, Under the Table","Dovey Wan is a partner at Primitive Ventures, a crypto asset investment fund, and a member of CoinDesk's advisory board.  This essay is presented as a part of No Closing Bell, a series leading up to Invest: Asia 2019 focused on how the Asian crypto markets are interacting with and impacting global investors. To keep the conversation going in person, register for Invest: Asia 2019 coming up in Singapore on Sept. 11-12.      There remains a great deal of confusion surrounding the legal status of cryptocurrency in China.  Between headlines like ""China Bans Bitcoin"", ""China Bans Crypto Exchanges?"", and ""China Bans Bitcoin Mining,"" it's no surprise that most people are unclear on where China stands on cryptocurrency and whether that has any real bearing on how its citizens behave.  We hope to demystify this and offer some insight into the legal status of cryptocurrency and related matters.  In law  In China, bitcoin is legally recognized and protected as virtual property. This has been the law since 2013 and the classification was reconfirmed in the recent Hangzhou court ruling.  However, this does not recognize bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies as legal currency. Hence, any use of Bitcoin as a currency is illegal. Occasional peer-to-peer OTC transactions are acceptable, as long as the behavior remains on a small scale. All mainland financial institutions are barred from any involvement in virtual currencies and foreign entities are also prohibited from serving mainland customers.  China has been progressively restricting more aspects of cryptocurrency within its borders dating back to September 2017, when it began by banning ICOs because of the financial risk and frequent fraud.  Since then, China has not hesitated to prosecute seriously offending ICOs or crypto scams, which were clearly scamming their customers, such as Hero Chain, EOSPLUS, TronDotWallet, PlusToken, MGC, and DOGX. Some of them raised a ton of money from retail and exit scammed, some disguised as wallets or high-yield quant fund. The largest among them is PlusToken, which has scammed over a whopping $3 billion in total. Core team members of PlusToken were arrested earlier this year in Vanuatu with the help of local police and are now facing decades in jail.  The ICO rules also restricted the activity of cryptocurrency exchanges domiciled in mainland China, as they are considered to be facilitating illegal fundraising and financial crimes. To preserve their businesses after the ban, these exchanges restructured and moved overseas to countries such as Japan, Singapore and registered in countries like the Seychelles and Malta.  However, some exchanges, including Huobi and OKEx, continue to conspicuously serve Chinese customers in crypto to crypto trading, and facilitate yuan to BTC/USDT exchange disguised behind a peer-to-peer OTC front.  The regulatory requirements on bitcoin mining are relatively fuzzy, the “ban” was not issued by a legal or regulatory department, but rather came from a “industry structure reform recommendation” from a state planning agency, which usually serves as a guideline instead of actual regulation. Hence, we haven’t seen any material impact on local mining facilities due to this “ban”. While many Chinese miners are currently looking for foreign sites, that is primarily due to fierce local competition rather than regulatory concerns.  In practice  The actual handling of cryptocurrency in mainland China in practice doesn't reflect the letter of the law, however.  It's no secret that Chinese citizens remain deeply involved in cryptocurrency mining, trading, and ICOs/IEOs. While official figures say that the percentage of cryptocurrency trading attributable to the yuan has dropped from 90% to 1% in the wake of the 2017 regulation, this does not account for over-the-counter trading which is where most fiat to crypto volume in China has shifted to since the regulation.  OTC options are offered by exchanges like Huobi as well as by locally managed WeChat groups. These OTC desks take the form of a marketplace where buy and sell orders are offered manually and transactions are done in a peer-to-peer manner. The platform here merely acts as a place for buyers and sellers to discover each other, rather than facilitating trades itself as exchanges do.  Payment can be handled between two parties once they have agreed on a trade through WeChat, Alipay, or banking wire, though China is attempting to crack down on that as well by blocking mobile payment platforms from processing crypto related payments. The biggest risk of peer-to-peer OTC trading is counterparty risk. If you want to buy Bitcoin from someone you have to 1) Agree on the price with that party, 2) Send RMB first, 3) Receive Bitcoin once the other party has received the payment.  For this reason, most of the OTC WeChat groups have very strict rules for dealing with new members and only deal with those who have been in the group for long enough to have a good track record.  To give you a sense of the volume that these desks handle, Huobi OTC has surpassed $100M USD in volume and WeChat OTC groups such as this one report processing a daily volume of $300k a day on average. There are thousands of similar WeChat OTC groups operating at a small scale, but together add up to a significant amount of crypto trading volume originating from China that is not accounted for by official figures.  If one has the desire, buying cryptocurrency in China is by no means difficult. There are plenty of tutorials such as this one outlining various simple ways to purchase cryptocurrencies with RMB. Local liquidity for Bitcoin and USDT are excellent, despite what the regulators' official statements might suggest.  Once traders have gotten their hands on Bitcoin or USDT, they can then freely exchange that for other cryptocurrencies on exchanges, even ones that try to block Chinese customers, by using the credentials of people from other countries. KYC materials can be obtained for a mere $75 online and allow Chinese citizens access to exchanges as well as IEOs and ICOs. Crypto-to-crypto volume on exchanges like Huobi, OKEx, and Gate.io are still very dominated by Chinese retail, and OKEx derivatives trading is also dominated by Chinese whales and traders.  As a result of the ban, different trading behaviors and selections of assets have emerged on these Chinese dominated exchanges compared to those on US exchanges like Bittrex, Bitstamp and Kraken.  After the ban, China took to using Tether ($USDT) as a substitute to yuan in trading pairs. Tether has since developed into a USD replacement in even some non-crypto cross-border business cases. This is one possible explanation for why Tether has been so resilient to negative press such as the Tether-Bitfinex $850 million cover-up and over 60% of newly issued Tether is traded in Chinese background exchanges —it is supported by the crucial role it plays in the huge amount of crypto trading that depends on it in China.  Because of the central role it plays, people in China don’t care whether it’s fully backed by reserve, as long as they remain able to exchange USDT for Yuan with local counterparties.  China's legal actions against cryptocurrency certainly had a huge impact on crypto activity within its borders. It changed the landscape of crypto trading in China and caused many crypto companies to move overseas. But the resilience and perseverance of Chinese crypto entrepreneurs are remarkable, which clearly manifests “what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger”.  Cryptocurrency is still alive and well in China.

Originally, the .bank domain was reserved for government-regulated retail banks, savings associations, national banks, or bank holding companies.  However, according to fTLD director of compliance and policy, Heather Diaz, told Mashable:  “More recently, as the financial services arena has evolved, particularly as it relates to fintechs offering financial products/services (e.g., P2P payment providers, cryptocurrency companies), we have found that some prospective Registrants were seeking domains to enhance their legitimacy to market to regulated entities and/or consumers.""  By reinstating the old restrictions, fLTD is trying to “further secure these trusted spaces,” she said. Oddly, Diaz also said the registry has never accepted a crypto company’s application for a .bank domain name.  The name costs approximately $1,000 to host per year.  Included in this potential freeze are P2P payment providers, money transfer businesses, and microloan providers. The company hasn’t formally enacted the restrictions, and has opened the decision to public comment until August 24.

According to data from mining services operator BTC.com, the average bitcoin mining hash rate over the last two weeks has reached 71.43 quintillion hashes per second (EH/s), up from 64.49EH/s on July 23. The threshold was breached as bitcoin adjusted its mining difficulty at block height 586,672 on Monday 2:52 UTC – that is a 6.94EH/s, or 10.78 percent jump since mid July.  Bitcoin mining difficulty is a measure of how hard it is to compete for mining rewards on bitcoin. Just how difficult the bitcoin software makes it to generate new blocks adjusts every 2,016 blocks – approximately every 14 days – to ensure the block production time remains about 10 minutes at the next cycle.  Assume this additional 6.9EH/s (or 6.9 million tera hashes per second, TH/s) computing power has all come from powerful ASIC miners, such as Bitmain’s AntMiner S17 or MicroBT’s WhatsMiner M20S, both of which boast a mining rate of around 55TH/s and recently hit the market.  That means more than 100,000 top-of-line ASIC miners could have been switched on within the past two weeks. Further, given these products have been sold for at least $2,000 each, this equates to some $200 million in revenue pocketed for major miner makers.  The continued interest in bitcoin mining comes at a time when the cryptocurrency's price appears to be en route to challenging all-time highs, however distantly, and amid the arrival of the rainy season in China, which leads to cheaper hydropower electricity costs in the country’s southwest provinces – a region that is reported to account for 50 percent of the global mining activity,  Miners in China estimated earlier this year that bitcoin’s hash rate in the summer would break the level of 70EH/s. To be clear, at several single points of time, bitcoin’s hash rate had already crossed that level in June and even reached 80EH/s around Aug. 1.  However, today marks the first time that the two-week average computing power has been able to remain above the 70EH/s threshold. As such, bitcoin’s mining difficulty has also set a new record of nearly 10 trillion.  Market change  Amidst this uptick in mining interest, there have been notable changes in the mining market, where top manufacturers are racing to produce more powerful equipment.  For instance, in Bitmain’s 2018 initial public offering prospectus, the Beijing-based mining giant claimed it had a 70 percent market dominance. Now, it may be facing serious competition from rival players that some believe are capable of shipping more top-of-line products with better profitability.  Michael Zhong, a former mining analyst who now operates mining farms at a startup called The Force Mining, told CoinDesk that based on his experience, the production capacity ranking among major Chinese miner makers for their flagship products have changed over the years.  Zhong explained that from 2017 to 2018, Bitmain had topped the list with its AntMiner S9 series miners, followed by Canaan’s Avalon 8 series machines. InnoSilicon, Ebang and former Bitmain design director’s MicroBT were all in the third position at the time.  But from January to June this year, the delivery capacity ranking has reshuffled, with now MicroBT’s WhatsMiner M20 series at the top, followed by Bitmain’s S17 series miners and then InnoSilicon, Canaan, and Ebang, Zhong added.  According to F2pool’s miner profit tracker, Bitmain’s flagship AntMiner S17 Pro ranks third in terms of mining profitability, following BitFury’s Tardis and MicroBT’s WhatsMiner M20S. The cost for WhatsMiner M20S is around $3,000, while that of AntMiner S17 Pro is around $4,000 each, based on the information advertised on the two firms’ websites.  Although orders for these flagship machines have queued up until November and December this year, MicroBT’s founder Zuoxing Yang told CoinDesk previously that the bottleneck of production capacity is the availability of chips from suppliers.  For example, MicroBT uses 10-nm chips for its M20 series, which are relatively more affordable with a higher level of availability compared to more advanced 7-nm chips used by Bitmain for its AntMiner S17 series equipment.  While Bitmain has always been relying on chips supplied by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), MicroBT has switched from TSMC to Samsung earlier this year for its flagship products.  Both TSMC and Samsung have estimated in their most recent Q2 earnings calls that the demand for cryptocurrency mining chips will come back in the third and the fourth quarter this year.

At 15:00 UTC on August 4, bitcoin rose above $11,000 for the first time in 21-days.  BTC's price stalled and then was retested along the $10,600 area on Aug. 4, proceeded by a breakout above $11,000, 10 hours after its most recent sell-off. BTC was last seen changing hands at $11,227 after a strong hourly candle broke above $11,050.  The move for BTC has also been accompanied by $3.9 billion in total volume traded over a 24-hour period hinting at a need for greater levels in order to sustain any further pushes to previous resistances seen at $11,400 and $11,880, but given today’s trajectory that is certainly possible.  As a result, other major names are flashing green today with Ether (ETH), TRON (TRX) and Tezos (XTZ) up between 1.7 and four percent, respectively.  Further, the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined rose by more than $9 billion over a 24-hour period, marking another consecutive day in the green and spurring on the possibility for a continuation in BTC's price.  The short-term outlook now favors the bulls, given the weekly close produced a large bullish engulfing candle with eyes now setting on the weekly resistances at $11,400 and $11,880.
