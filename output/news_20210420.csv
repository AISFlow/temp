42434240,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPAFXh,1618957800,South Korea Kicks Off New Crackdown on Illicit Crypto Activities,"The South Korean government will crack down on “illegitimate crypto businesses” as well as all forms of money laundering and scams that involve cryptocurrency.      The Office for Government Policy Coordination (OPC) announced the enforcement Monday. The authorities are targeting all “illegal activity involving virtual assets” during a “special enforcement period” from April to June. The “enforcement” is related to a crypto-related law that went into effect earlier this year.      The OPC statement is a declaration that various state agencies will be given the authority to investigate, monitor and punish crypto businesses, or virtual asset service providers (VASP). The state will also determine in the coming months which VASPs are legit and which will be deemed illegal. The law requires VASPs to register with financial authorities, which sounds simple but the screening process is expected to be rigorous.      The decision to implement such a crackdown was made on April 16 during an OPC-led meeting with representatives of various government institutions, including the Ministry of Economy and Finance, the Ministry of Science and ICT, the Justice Ministry and the National Police Agency (NPA).      The Financial Services Commission (FSC) has the authority to monitor all inflows and outflows of cryptocurrency. The FSC’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) will analyze data from exchanges and report any suspicious transactions to prosecutors, police investigators and the national tax service.      Last month, the FSC issued a “warning” to crypto traders to “check the registration status” of exchanges, advising them to use only exchanges that are “sustainable in the long term.” This was read by industry insiders as a de facto declaration that many VASPs will be declared illegitimate and shut down.      The government is also keeping its eye on arbitrage trading. Because South Korea’s kimchi premium has soared to as high as 22% in recent weeks, some traders have been sending money abroad to purchase crypto in exchanges outside South Korea, which they send back to Korean exchanges to sell and profit off the premium. The Ministry of Economy and Finance and the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS), which is under the FSC, are currently working to determine whether such arbitrage trading violates the country’s foreign exchange laws.      South Korea has been the scene of a string of pyramid schemes and scams involving crypto. Many of these scams extract cash and crypto deposits from victims by promising them extravagant returns and interest on investments. CoinDesk reported on similar scams in Nigeria. The NPA is expected to establish a separate department for investigating such crypto-related crimes.      But the legal oversight doesn’t stop there. The Fair Trade Commission, South Korea’s antitrust authority, will begin reviewing the user agreements of exchanges to determine whether or not they violate fair trade laws. Many in the local crypto community agree that most exchanges probably won’t survive the oncoming regulatory onslaught, leaving only a few giants to monopolize the market.      The Korea Communications Commission, which is modeled after the Federal Communications Commission in Washington, has been tasked with monitoring online activity for illegal crypto trading. The Personal Information Protection Commission, directed by the Office of the Prime Minister, will investigate VASPs’ personal data protection systems. The government plans will also begin building the infrastructure to enforce crypto tax laws that will go into effect in January 2022.      Koo Yoon-cheol, head of the OPC, said in the announcement that “nobody can guarantee the value of virtual assets, meaning virtual asset trading is more speculative than it is an investment.”      “With the recent scams, pyramid schemes, and other illegal activity we’ve seen, traders must be extremely careful,” he warned.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,Felix Im,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/20/south-korea-kicks-off-new-crackdown-on-illicit-crypto-activities,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e4531c1c6b5b079ad6f4059448cd70f40e471239-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434245,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPAFhh,1618953054,"Solana Bucked Bitcoin Sell-Off; Upstart Blockchain Challenges Ethereum on Speed, Fees","Solana, the native token of the blockchain backed by FTX's Sam Bankman-Fried, logged a record daily percentage gain on Sunday, defying bitcoin's (BTC) 6% sell-off.      The SOL tokens surged 30% on the FTX exchange to near $33 that day, according to TradingView. It was a staggering daily return considering that prices for bitcoin, along with most of other crypto assets, dropped to multi-week lows.      After a year-to-date return of nearly 1,600%, Solana now has a total market capitalization of more than $8.3 billion, according to Messari, just after Tron’s $9.17 billion.      Bankman-Fried said in a series of messages via LinkedIn that the factors driving Solana may have been independent from the forces at work in last weekend's crypto sell-off.      “SOL traders were probably not as leveraged long, and so there were fewer liquidations,” he said.      Crypto futures market saw a record $10 billion worth of liquidations over the past weekend, with bitcoin’s futures totaling about $5 billion, according to data from Bybt:      Whereas solana’s futures liquidations contributed roughly $18.1 million of the total crypto liquidation:      Alameda, a trading firm led by Bankman-Fried, has been heavily investing in the Solana ecosystem in a bid to promote an Ethereum alternative capable of faster transactions and higher scalability. The Ethereum blockchain has become increasingly congested, leading to an increase in transactional tariffs known as ""gas fees.""      Bankman-Fried's team chose to build Serum, a decentralized exchange (DEX), on Solana.      A representative of Solana community in China told CoinDesk via WeChat that public blockchains including Binance Smart Chain and Solana have been able to lure away more decentralized finance (DeFi) developers and projects from Ethereum due to the consistently high gas fees on Ethereum.      Ethereum currently handles about 15 transactions per second (TPS), while Solana is capable of more than 1,000 TPS, according to data from blockchair and Solana Beach.      “It is a combination of people being fed up with gas fees and comparisons on decentralization with other major non-Ethereum blockchains,” Bankman-Fried said.      As a proof-of-stake blockchain, Solana grants reward incentives for SOL token holders who are staking their tokens to help secure the network, according to Chris Bo, China lead for Solana blockchain. Another incentive for Solana validators is an inflation-related mechanism that went live in February. With an initial annualized inflation rate of 8%, newly minted tokens go to validators and stakers in proportion to their staked amounts.      The inflation rate will decrease by 15% each year until it reaches 1.5%, according to Solana’s website.",POSITIVE,BTC | SOL,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | SOL,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/20/solana-bucked-bitcoin-sell-off-upstart-blockchain-challenges-ethereum-on-speed-fees,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bdc7ca277a09244c621c38d3318049d15a7ec529-1300x768.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $56,665 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 1.6% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $53,780-$56,574 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC close to the 10-hour and 50-hour moving average on the hourly chart, a sideways but rising and trending bullish signal for market technicians.    Despite going as high as $56,574 to as low as $53,780 over the past 24 hours, bitcoin’s price is relatively sideways since 0:00 UTC on Tuesday (8 p.m. ET Monday). It’s a respite for a market that saw a deep dive during the weekend as record-high action in the derivatives market saw the price of the world’s oldest cryptocurrency drop to $53,787 according to CoinDesk 20 data.      Katie Stockon, a technical analyst for research firm Fairlead Strategies, noted in her weekly outlook that the bitcoin market is in a ""risk-off"" mode, meaning investors could be pushing the sell button to move into other assets such as cash.      “There are indications that this week will see downturns in our short-term gauges,” Stockton noted. “For one, risk-off positioning has become evident on the sector front in assets like gold and bitcoin.”      Read More: Bitcoin Traders Are Buying More Downside Protection, Options Data Shows      In the derivatives market, bitcoin funding rates, reflecting what traders pay for leverage on positions, slid to 14 basis points on Monday. That’s the lowest in almost a month, according to data aggregator Glassnode.      That means market interest in bull-oriented leveraged plays has evaporated. The lowest in the past month was 5 basis points March 26. Traders are waiting to see if the figure will get to that point.      Neil Van Huis, head of institutional trading for liquidity provider Blockfills, says last week’s excitement from the bellwether exchange Coinbase’s Nasdaq direct listing has subsided. He worries about downside risk, despite holding on to his bullish stance.      “Still looks bullish to me – breaking $38,000 or so would make me a bit more nervous,” Van Huis told CoinDesk.    Ether making moves in price, dominance    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up Tuesday, trading around $2,313 and climbing 6.3% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      Read More: Introducing CoinDesk Indexes      Darius Sit, chief investment officer for quantitative trading firm QCP Capital, doesn’t see any fundamental reasons why ether's performance was much higher on Tuesday when bitcoin traded relatively sideways. “Don’t see anything material,” he told CoinDesk.      It is clear, however, that traders are rotating out of other crypto assets and into ETH.      Ether’s market dominance Tuesday, a measure of its share of the larger crypto ecosystem, was up 3.6% today as of press time and at 13.1% overall according to charting provider TradingView.    Dogecoin Doesn’t Bite on 'Dogeday'    After jumping over 19% Monday, the canine-oriented meme cryptocurrency dogecoin (DOGE) was in the red 16.2% as of press time, according to CoinDesk 20 data. Enthusiasts were expected to rally the price Tuesday for “Dogeday”. However, dogecoin’s cryptocurrency’s volatility is more of a story than its price Tuesday, according to Greg Magadini, CEO of derivatives data provider Genesis Volatility.      Magadini’s firm, which tracks volatility metrics for 90 different altercoin’s, pegs dogecoin as the third-highest volatile digital asset it tracks on Tuesday, trailing only ziliqua (ZIL) and voyager token (VGX).      However, dogecoin is significantly more liquid than those two assets, Magadini noted, meaning there are a lot more traders and investors betting on DOGE’s spot price.      “The difference with dogecoin and these other [altcoins] is DOGE actually has a sizable market cap, so this volatility is much more significant,” Magadini told CoinDesk.      Dogecoin’s market capitalization ranks sixth overall among cryptocurrencies at around $46 billion, according to data aggregator CoinGecko. ZIL and VGX combined only make up about $3 billion.      “Right now, the way DOGE is moving risk is greatly increasing,” Magadini said.

42434243,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPAFdh,1618949968,"DOGE Army Retreats, Tail Between Legs, as Dogeday Ends With 21% Drop","Some fans of the joke cryptocurrency dogecoin had positioned Tuesday as a day to send its prices skyrocketing – to $1, or maybe just a meme-y 69 cents. On the meme-y date of April 20, or 4/20.      Prices for the eight-year-old cryptocurrency, ticker DOGE, had surged more than 60-fold this year to a market value of more than $40 billion. So it seemed like anything was possible. Social media posters dubbed it ""dogeday.""      But as of midafternoon, the joke appeared to be on the dogecoin holders. As of press time, the token, symbolized by the Shiba Inu dog breed, was down 21% on the day, to the decidedly unremarkable price of 34 cents. Earlier it had fallen to as low as 29 cents.      ""Many retail crypto traders were hoping for today to be a successful 'Dogeday' by sending dogecoin to the moon,"" wrote Edward Moya, senior market analyst for the brokerage Oanda. ""Some were eyeing the $0.50 level as an area to take some profit, with others having outlandish hopes of a skyrocketing move to the $1 mark. The current retail fervor probably won’t completely give up on dogecoin, but a sell-the-event reaction could be in the cards.""      The DOGE dump came even as at least one analyst, Bloomberg Intelligence's Mike McGlone, wrote that the cryptocurrency might be due for further gains.      “Gaining somewhat of a global cult following, we see little to stop DOGE from continuing to appreciate, at least in the near term,” McGlone, a commodity strategist known for his prescient bitcoin price predictions last year, wrote Tuesday in a report. ""Dogecoin may be casino-like fun.""      It was a shot of water in the face for DOGE fans who may have instead been looking for a treat – in the form of fast profits or instant fortunes.      A remaining question is whether this year's gains in dogecoin might draw fresh capital and labor to the project, similar to the way last year's pump in GameStop shares led to a $1 billion capital raise, a search for new management and potentially a transition to an e-commerce strategy. At one point, dogecoin had a market value bigger than the centuries-old U.K. bank Barclays.      Blockchain data shows that activity is increasing on the network: Active Dogecoin addresses have climbed to record, and transactions are at a seven-year high, according to the analytics firm Coin Metrics. CoinDesk reported earlier this year that project development on the blockchain has picked up, with top contributions from Bitcoin Core developers, based on activity on the open-source software site GitHub.      Within broader digital-asset markets, the DOGE frenzy appeared to spread to decentralized finance (DeFi), where several imitator tokens have chalked up staggering single-day gains.      The first is SHIB (get it? Shiba Inu?), a decentralized experimental token nicknamed the ""dogecoin killer,"" trading on the decentralized exchange Uniswap. The token, launched under the Ethereum blockchain's ERC-20 standard, has rallied over 5,000% in the past four weeks and rose 95% on Monday alongside DOGE's rally to record highs near 43 cents. The coin has registered a trading volume of over $200 million in the past 24 hours, Uniswap data shows.      Another coin, weed doge (WOGE), launched this week, allegedly in a bid to donate funds to people considered unjustly jailed for marijuana-related offenses. WOGE rallied 1,058% from to $0.0950 on Monday though was last seen trading near $0.0170 on Uniswap.      ""Since DOGE has been taking care of us and providing us with godly profits this bull run, we also wanted to create a meaningful coin that gives back to the people in a handful of ways,"" says a post on CryptoMoonShots Reddit page.      Most of this ridiculousness is seen as evidence of froth in cryptocurrency markets, at a time when bitcoin prices have doubled this year – ostensibly as a hedge against inflation, in the wake of trillions of dollars of money printing by the Federal Reserve and other central banks.      Bloomberg's McGlone noted that dogecoin had demonstrated ""divergent strength"" as bitcoin's price has retreated in recent days. The report was published prior to Tuesday's losses in dogecoin.      But sometimes, apparently, the DOGE doesn't come when called.",NEGATIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BTC | DOGE | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,"Damanick Dantes, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/20/doge-army-retreats-tail-between-legs-as-dogeday-ends-with-21-drop,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/343c1e7c232d725c500a0d348c031b5835a59f7c-1200x883.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434241,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPAFZh,1618946730,Bitcoin and Gold Are Complementary Investments,"In many aspects of life, we have a tendency to assume a zero–sum approach to decision-making. What is good for one side is decidedly and proportionately disadvantageous for the other: Heads I win, tails you lose. You are either a dog or cat person, a skier or a snowboarder, prefer the aisle or window seat.      But nothing is one dimensional in today’s complex and multi-faceted investment universe. The vast majority of decisions are actually non-zero-sum, especially if we consider the trillions upon trillions that comprise the global capital markets.    Russell Starr is President, CEO and Director of Trillium Gold Mines Inc., a Director of Canada Nickel Company and a Senior Advisor to DeFi Technologies. He will be speaking at Consensus by CoinDesk, our virtual experience May 24-27. Register here.    When it comes to cryptocurrencies and gold, the popular narrative is that the former is stealing the latter’s thunder – crypto's gains are gold’s losses. Again, the impulse to distill it down to an either/or scenario comes with a very costly lesson, your money. The prudent asset mix considers the maximum return for the lowest level of volatility. As in the case of gold and crypto, each fulfils a complementary function as a repository of value in a global context of uncertainty and looming inflation.      The gold market is estimated at over $11 trillion, which reflects a 2,500-year head start as a globally recognized medium of exchange and value. By contrast, bitcoin has a market cap of about $1 trillion. Even the amount of physical gold held by central banks and investors equates to many times bitcoin’s current market. In 2020, gold’s average daily volume was $125 billion, or roughly 30 times bitcoin’s daily spot volume of some $4 billion. Notwithstanding, both assets have highly liquid markets, meaning there is undeniably ample space for both crypto and gold to flourish.    Read more: Money Reimagined: Bitcoin’s Road to Gold    So, rather than view crypto and gold as competitors, an acceptable analogy might be to consider crypto as the legitimate offspring, or spinoff, with certain common markers. They both have low correlation to other families of assets, and they are inflation–sensitive, great diversifiers and alternatives to fiat issues. Gold is a reliable, age-old secure store of value, and the other a new generation that is growing and evolving, quick to react but lacking the wisdom of longevity.      While investors in the U.S. are jumping onto the crypto bandwagon – which might create the impression that gold is passé – elsewhere in the world, people long accustomed to buying gold are only now open to considering crypto.      Investors should be cautious that investing in crypto at the wrong time can result in rapid and severe losses. Anything that can appreciate unimaginably quickly may be prone to severe corrections. Nothing is guaranteed. While crypto is embraced in North America and some other countries, it is practically banned in China and frowned upon in South Korea.    An acceptable analogy might be to consider crypto as the legitimate offspring, or spinoff, with certain common markers    As a believer in both gold and crypto (particularly DeFi), I can envision gold’s reinstatement in North American portfolios at $2,200 highs. That doesn’t preclude investors from diversifying into other asset classes such as crypto. There are already signs of inflation, much more so than the feds would have you believe, and as governments continue to print money, it will continue its upward trajectory. That means the price of gold, bitcoin, ethereum and critically decentralized finance (DeFi) will all benefit.      The view held by Peter Schiff, a former chief economist and strategist of Euro Pacific Capital, that cryptocurrencies are not money and that investments in them are foolhardy, is flawed in my opinion. Inarguably, the value of anything lies in what one is willing to pay for it. The fate of any currency, digital or otherwise, is in the hands of the financial institutions and credit card companies that actualize its relevance.    Read more: Crypto Long & Short: Is Bitcoin More Like Gold or Equities?    As DeFi protocols grow, built off the back of Ethereum and Bitcoin, you simply can't argue that these digital entities have no value. Crypto’s value, driven by DeFi alone, could make it worth the value of all the traditional financial markets.      The psychology of investing has shown that reasonable and rational behavior almost never coincide. One might think that a bitcoin necklace is worthless, when in reality, it’s not. There are very astute institutional investors and savvy legendary macro investors who believe that crypto is the future because it’s creating a crypto-economy that can run without government–based monopolies that exist now.      Think of it as Facebook 2.0 or Email 2.0 – back in the mid-1990s, email (and certainly Facebook) barely existed. Email was a burgeoning novelty appreciated by few; no one expected to use email as legal tender, or was convinced the internet was safe. Yet look at where we are today. Things change before we know it, which lends credence to the notion that cryptocurrencies and destabilizing DeFi protocols are here to stay.      The benefits of crypto, DeFi and blockchain technology are immense – whether it’s Know Your Client (KYC), the elimination of terrorist financing, or eliminating proceeds of crime – cannot be underestimated. These protocols are significant advantages over gold, which can be made untraceable. Some still think the Nazi gold hordes reside in gold vaults all over the world – no one can argue these are not direct proceeds of terrorism.      If we foresee a place for gold and crypto in the future, over time I expect they will couple and correlate. That’s if the past is any indication. If bitcoin can conceivably reach $80,000–$100,000, and gold $3,500–$5,000 in the near to medium term, people will be likely to invest in both. And the DeFi protocols that grow off the Ethereum/Bitcoin and other blockchains may be worth hundreds of thousands of multiples more.      No, crypto is not likely to replace gold. They are two sides of a coin, the patriarch and progeny, each in a position to benefit from the other’s experience and perspective.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | FIAT | MARKET,Russell Starr,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/04/20/bitcoin-and-gold-are-complementary-investments,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4b28dda652b4b4b2b74eb181ffc98cab0c6768d9-1400x933.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411944,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glhEYB,1618942740,4 Ways to Stay Safe in Crypto,"Digital assets are resistant to censorship by design and give private key holders complete control over their crypto. The only caveat is that investors are solely responsible for protecting and safely storing their own funds.  The crypto community is growing at an exponential rate, with the number of users now totaling over 100 million. It’s reported that at least 14 million users are new market participants as of 2021, drawn in by the latest bull cycle excitement and eager to invest in their futures. These first-time crypto users can be easy targets for cybercriminals and scammers if they don’t follow basic online security protocols and crypto best practices.  According to recent findings from the Ciphertrace “2020 Cryptocurrency Crime and Anti-Money Laundering Report,” over $1.9 billion worth of crypto assets were stolen via hacks, scams and fraud in 2020. This figure is down from $4.5 billion the year before.  Among these, exit scams and decentralized finance (DeFi) hacks were highlighted as the leading causes of crypto theft. “Massive exit scams have dominated cryptocurrency crimes in the last two years. In 2019, the Ponzi scheme PlusToken netted $2.9 billion with its exit scam – 64% of the year’s major crime volume,” the report said. In 2020 was ""WoToken, a similar scheme operated by some of the same people as PlusToken"" that defrauded investors ""out of $1.1 billion in its exit scam – 58% of 2020’s major crime volume. While major fraud volume saw a significant decrease, it still made up 73% of 2020’s crime total.”  Last year also saw a rise in sophisticated phishing attacks – fake emails used to deliver malware or dupe victims into handing over their crypto, passwords and personal information. In July 2020, Twitter was the target of such an attack, leading to a group of hackers gaining access to more than 130 high-profile accounts and using them to promote a bitcoin giveaway scam. Apple, Uber, Ripple, Binance, Elon Musk, Barack Obama, Bill Gates, Kim Kardashian and even CoinDesk were among those affected.  So how do you protect yourself from these types of cyberattacks?  1. Be aware of the most common crypto scams  There are three main types of scams you will undoubtedly come across when starting out in the crypto space. It’s important to learn how to spot these scams before ending up a victim and potentially losing your assets.  Fake crypto giveaways  Trading bot scams  Phishing emails  Fake crypto giveaways  Crypto giveaway scams are online posts, usually on social media, that invite users to deposit crypto to an address with the promise the sender will receive double or more back. This type of fraud has been around since the initial coin offering boom of 2017 and tends to abide by a very rigid format. This makes fake crypto giveaway scams easy to spot once you know what to look for.  They use the identities of famous celebrities or business icons to promote the scam. Most of the time, this is done from fake social media profiles or imposter accounts (blue arrow.) With last year's Twitter hack, however, real accounts were used, so you always have to be on alert.  Crypto giveaway scams ALWAYS promise to send you back more funds than you deposit, but this is a completely false statement and you should never send any money to the address provided.  Scammers use other fake Twitter accounts to flood the comment sections with messages supporting the scam offer and confirming it works (red arrow.) This is just another tactic to convince genuine social media users to hand over their crypto funds. Shortly after, the fake user accounts are usually deleted.     Top tip: The best way to spot a scam is to look for subtle changes to the profile’s username. In the example above, the scammer created an account with the Twitter handle @Elonmmusk. The extra “m” is subtle and can be easily overlooked at a glance. Verified Twitter accounts also have blue check marks next to the account name to help users identify legitimate accounts.  Trading bot scams  Fraudulent trading bot websites are another classic crypto scam. These involve platforms that promise users extremely high rates of return every month. These websites operate as a Ponzi scheme – where new money entering the scam is used to pay people who are already invested in the scam. Once the creators of the platform have accumulated enough funds they usually disappear with investors’ money and close down the website.  One of the most famous examples is Bitconnect. This platform promised investors 40% returns every month as well as additional interest for people who invested larger amounts. The platform ran over two years and its native token even became a top 10 cryptocurrency before regulators eventually shut it down. Over $250 million was believed to have been stolen when the creators of Bitconnect disappeared.  Here are some telltale signs of a fraudulent crypto trading bot platform:  Crypto trading bot Ponzi schemes always promise very high rates of return.  Usually, you cannot find any information about the team behind the platform. If the platform does have a team page, check to see if team members’ Linkedin, email or Twitter accounts are connected. You can also try searching for individuals on the internet to see if they’re real people.  There is no information or documentation on how the trading bot works.  It’s common to see multiple spelling errors on the website.  Phishing emails  Phishing scams are becoming increasingly difficult to detect as malicious agents take greater care in creating seemingly real emails from legitimate companies. Many will encourage people to click on links that instantly infect the device with malware, giving the perpetrator full access to information stored on it. Other phishing emails will redirect users to imposter websites and ask them to reset their passwords, send money or reconfirm their seed words.  When faced with a suspicious email that asks you to divulge sensitive information, send payments or click on links, it’s important to remember three key rules:  Always check the sending email address.  NEVER open links from an unknown sender.  NEVER share your personal information, passwords or seed words with anyone. If you’re ever uncertain about any email, head to the official website and contact customer support.  2. Never make a digital copy of your personal crypto details  One of the biggest mistakes both first-time and experienced crypto users make is creating digital copies of their crypto wallet passwords, seed words or backup codes. Digital copies can be anything from:  Taking a screenshot using your laptop or desktop  Taking a photograph using your mobile phone  Copy and pasting the code into an email, on a notepad app or anywhere else on your device  As soon as you create a digital copy of your sensitive information, you run the risk of a hacker gaining access to it through malware, brute force attacks and other attack vectors.  The best way to safely copy and store your crypto information is either through writing it down on paper away from people and any device camera, or etching it into metal plates. Providers of this solution include:  Cryptotag  Coldbit  Cryptosteel  Simbit     3. Always enable 2-factor authentication when possible  When opening a new crypto account, it’s important to enable two-factor authentication (2FA) if the option is available on the platform. 2FA is simply a verification process that requires two or more pieces of information, usually from two different devices, to grant access to an account.  While there are several different methods to do this, including receiving an SMS or code via email, a vast majority of crypto platforms ask the user to download a third-party mobile app that links to the new account and generates a random, self-destructing, six-digit password that replenishes every 30-40 seconds. This adds a vital second layer of security to any service and makes it significantly more difficult for a malicious agent to access.  The main 2FA apps that are widely compatible with crypto websites are:  Google authenticator  Authy  To set it up, download whichever 2FA app is supported by the platform you’re using. Once that’s done, you’ll need to head to your online account settings, find the privacy settings and then click “enable 2FA.” Find the option to set up via a QR code and click it.  Then go on to your mobile 2FA app, find the “+” icon and then the “Scan QR code” button. Clicking this will open your smartphone camera. Simply aim it at the QR code that appears on your laptop screen and it will automatically add the account to your 2FA app and a password will appear.  When setting up 2FA for the first time you have to type in the password on your account settings as it appears in your mobile app. This then enables 2FA on your account. Once that’s done, every time you log into that service you’ll need to type in your login password and the 2FA password.  4. Use a different password for every crypto platform you use  So you’ve enabled 2FA on all your crypto accounts, you’ve copied all your sensitive information on paper or on to metal plates and you’re now always on the lookout for potential crypto scams. This is all great, but now let’s imagine one of the websites you’ve used accidentally leaks its customers' information including your email and password. Let’s assume you use the same email and password for all your accounts, even the ones for which you haven’t enabled 2FA. Now you have a problem.  Using different passwords for all your crypto accounts is essential for reducing the impact data breaches and leaks can have on your online security. If you have multiple accounts and can’t feasibly remember several different passwords at the same time then there is a range of free password-managing browser extensions and apps you can use that store and generate secure passwords for your platforms.  All you have to do is set a master password to access the app and all the password data stored inside. Most password managers will automatically fill out any pre-saved login details when you arrive on a platform and prompt you to save any new login details to your vault when you create them.  Leading password managing services include:  Lastpass  1Password  Dashlane  So remember, while there are plenty of lucrative opportunities in the crypto space there are also countless scammers and cybercriminals looking to steal your digital assets.

42434244,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPAFfh,1618939641,"During Bitcoin's Latest Price Crash, 'Tether Premium' Shows Where Money Went","Tether (USDT), the oldest and most popular stablecoin, diverged significantly from its peg to the U.S. dollar during bitcoin's (BTC) recent price drop.      But rather than seeing the move as a defect of the stablecoin, whose market cap stands at $52 billion, some analysts and exchange executives say the ""tether premium"" shows the token's growing use as a safe-haven asset in almost-anything-can-happen-at-anytime cryptocurrency markets.      ""During a crash, traders will race to sell their bitcoin in exchange for tether, which is similar to the U.S. dollar in that it is recognized as a temporary safe haven amidst extreme price volatility,"" Kaiko, a blockchain data analytics firm, wrote in an April 19 newsletter. ""A sudden increase in buying pressure for tether often has the effect of causing positive drift from the stablecoin's one-to-one peg.""      The idea of tether as a safe haven might seem incongruous, given the nagging questions over the stablecoin issuer's credibility and financial backing. The company behind the stablecoin published an attestation in late March to verify its assets, after agreeing to an $18.5 million settlement with prosecutors in New York state.      Yet tether's market value has more than doubled from about $20 billion at the start of the year, a sign of traders' growing embrace of the stablecoin's convenience and efficiency as the de facto form of cash in cryptocurrency markets.      Tether's price rose above $1.004 as bitcoin started falling early Sunday. That was tether's highest level since March 2020, when the likely economic damaged from the coronavirus and related documents first became apparent, triggering a sell-off in a broad range of assets from stocks to cryptocurrencies.      Robbie Liu, market analyst at OKEx Insights, said tether's price increase may also be the result of demand from cryptocurrency derivatives traders who scrambled to line up USDT as collateral to meet margin calls.      ""First, the price of bitcoin dropped, and then the tether premium started to spike,"" Liu said. ""This market behavior is consistent with the previous flash crash, seen on February 22.""      Read More: First Mover: Laser Eyes Can’t Stop Correction as Bitcoin Tumbles to $53K      Adding to the picture, tether's price in Chinese yuan (CNY) was sold at a premium on crypto exchange Huobi's over-the-counter (OTC) desk even before Sunday's market correction.      Under normal market conditions, the price of tether expressed in yuan should match that of the U.S. dollar's exchange rate with the Asian currency.      A spokesperson from Huobi told CoinDesk that the connection between the timeline of the ""tether premium"" on Huobi's OTC desk and Sunday's sell-off is not ""strong.""      Instead, the price for the tether-CNY pair has traded at a significant premium recently. That price gap suggests there was elevated demand from Chinese traders and investors, who routinely use dollar-pegged stablecoins as an on-ramp to cryptocurrency markets. Fiat-to-crypto trading, or buying digital assets with government-issued cash, is banned in China.      Du Jun, co-founder of Huobi, told CoinDesk through a spokesperson that the USDT premium over the Chinese yuan happened as many traders were cashing out their crypto profits from the sharp price runup in many alternative cryptocurrencies that occurred in prior weeks.      The recent frenzy over dogecoin (DOGE) and other altcoins has attracted new investors to the crypto market from China, Du said, helping to cause the ""tether premium"" as demand for stablecoins rose on the OTC desk.      The sudden rise of dogecoin's value this month had pushed the total market capitalization of the dog-themed joke token above that of xrp (XRP), historically one of the largest cryptocurrencies. At press time, dogecoin was the sixth-biggest cryptocurrency in the world, with a market capitalization of nearly $50 billion, according to Messari.

Both Galaxy and BitGo declined to comment.      Silicon Valley’s BitGo was last year reported to have been in acquisition talks with fintech giant PayPal. No deal was reached, but PayPal offered as much as $750 million in cash for the custody company, CoinDesk reported last month, citing two sources familiar with the matter. PayPal later agreed to acquire Curv, another cryptocurrency custody firm.      “Galaxy does not do custody so it makes sense to bring that in-house,” one of the sources familiar with the discussions told CoinDesk. BitGo also administers WBTC, a service with $8.5 billion in locked value that “wraps” bitcoin into Ethereum-compatible tokens.      The sustained buoyancy of cryptocurrencies since late last year has seen a marked increase in activity involving custody firms, a key component in the institutionalization of digital asset trading. (Fireblocks, for instance, raised $133 million and confirmed it is working with BNY Mellon to power the global custody bank’s forthcoming crypto service.)      Details of the deal are unclear at this stage, but a traditional financial firm may also be involved alongside Galaxy, said one of the sources.

Galaxy, which also conducts investment banking advisory services, recently reported that income from its trading business had increased 842% to $238.7 million in Q4.

42434251,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPAFFh,1618936818,"The Node: Dogecoin Is a Joke, Get Over It","Is the dogecoin joke really on us pundits who try to make sense of the whole thing?      That’s essentially the take from Bloomberg’s Joe Weisenthal today. The Shiba Inu phenomenon has nothing to do with decentralization or stores of value or any other high-minded crypto concept like bitcoin, he writes. It’s beyond serious explanation.    This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    “Nobody can talk with a straight face when it comes to dogecoin,” he writes. “... Really, all the talking points go out the window with DOGE.”      “Bitcoiners who have made an extraordinary sum of money in a short period of time love to talk about how they’re taking on the [Federal Reserve] or taking on the banks or enabling some kind of peaceful revolution … Basically, dogecoin is like bitcoin stripped of the virtue signaling.”      The ultimate meme-coin has jumped from less than $0.02 at the end of January to more than $0.40 last night. Its market cap is now $50 billion-plus, according to CoinDesk’s numbers. And the momentum shows no signs of slowing. Today is #DogeDay on Twitter and the coin is set to win more internet friends.      Brands are noticing. Last week, meat stick maker Slim Jim unveiled its dogecoin “strategy,” pushing another ATH. And today the Mars confectionery company is promoting its Snickers and Milky Way brands with “Dogecoinrise” labels.      There have been many attempts to explain DOGE, including on these pages. CoinDesk’s Emily Parker said it represented a victory of “collective belief” and a longing for a purer form of crypto (i.e., for bitcoin before it became a mainstream thing).      Adam Levine, our podcast editor, said last week that DOGE had become “the joke currency to beat” in light of the Slim Jim news.      “Just as bitcoin is the consensus pick for people looking for ‘predictable moneyness’ in their currency, dogecoin is looking like the consensus pick for people who want ‘meme-y wackiness’ in their currency,” he wrote.      He added: “Everybody wants to be in on the joke, which pushes up the price, which makes the joke even bigger. It’s a self-reinforcing cycle. Sort of like bitcoin but for the luls.”      See also: Michael Casey – Memes Mean Money      Weisenthal isn’t having any of this high-mindedness, because the point of DOGE is essentially anti-intellectual.      This may be hard to take for people who believe in crypto’s ameliorative potential. But Weisenthal is surely right that you can spend too much time trying to understand the mind of the internet. Dogecoin is a joke and it’s funnier because the price goes higher and more people are laughing at it. That’s it.      Whatever the long-term implications of meme-culture for companies and society (including the scary notion that memes may be as important now as, say, product development), let’s leave the intellectualizing for another time. On Dogeday, it's enough to sit back and enjoy the fun of this runaway train careering through another station.

A blog post by CEO and founder Ankitt Gaur published later in the day said the hacker had transferred out 2.98 million EASY tokens, which were worth around $25 apiece at the time, for a total of around $75 million.  Also removed was $6 million from liquidity pools in U.S. dollars, dai and tether.  The amounts were transferred to an unknown wallet on the Ethereum network.  Gaur wrote that private keys to the network admin MetaMask account had been compromised through his computer, but the EasyFi smart contracts were not exploited.

42434226,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPA7zh,1618931613,State of Crypto: Unpacking Hester Peirce's Newest Safe Harbor Proposal,"Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Commissioner Hester Peirce published an updated version of her “safe harbor” proposal last week, just ahead of Gary Gensler’s confirmation as SEC chair. The old version introduced the concept of a three-year grace period to let a project launch. The new version defines what a successful project would actually look like. I break it down below.    You're reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Safer Harbor  The narrative    Cryptocurrency startups could benefit from a three-year grace period to build and launch their projects before they have to worry about federal securities laws. At least, that’s the premise of Hester Peirce’s proposed “Token Safe Harbor.” The second-term commissioner first proposed a safe harbor for cryptocurrency startups last year, which received feedback but wasn’t adopted by the other commissioners. She introduced a revised version on Tuesday, creating some more specific guidance for how a company could verify that its project is operational.    Why it matters    At present, most cryptocurrency startups that wish to raise capital by selling tokens ahead of building or launching must register with the SEC or risk facing an enforcement action. Registration could be costly if a project doesn’t have existing funds, and selling tokens in compliance with federal securities laws carries its own set of burdens. Commissioner Peirce’s proposal would let a startup take three years to create a “decentralized” blockchain network before having to assess whether it is in compliance with securities laws or whether the token still meets the federal definition of a “security.”      In other words, the safe harbor gives projects three years of breathing room, something many founders believe would benefit them. This could let startups come to market the same way the original Ethereum network did, said Lindsay Lin, a partner and counsel at Dragonfly Capital.      “Projects with novel technologies are not free to do what Ethereum did to bootstrap the network (initial coin offering, development, marketing) lest they violate securities laws,” she noted. “This fear creates a moat for grandfathered incumbents, which may be long-term counterproductive for the industry since challenger technologies may not easily break through the regulatory barrier to entry.”    Breaking it down    The most tangible difference between the old version and the new would be the introduction of exit guidance. Under the Token Safe Harbor Proposal 2.0, companies would have to tap outside counsel to evaluate their projects and create a report assessing whether the project meets certain criteria to be considered “decentralized” or “functional.”      If a project meets neither requirement, it would have a few months to sunset and become compliant with federal laws on registering as securities issuers.      As drafted, the revised proposal would let a company continue operating if it meets either definition. In other words, a functional, centralized project could escape the registration requirements.      “You can imagine a more centralized situation where there’s still a functional network,” Peirce told CoinDesk. “I hope to get feedback on that second part because a lot of people on the initial version were really focused on ‘how do we figure out decentralization,’ so maybe people will feel strongly that that second piece should change or is not necessary.”      Her goal is to determine when a project might fall outside the SEC’s jurisdiction and, therefore, would not have to register as a securities issuer.      Still, a project might be incentivized to only become functional and not focus on decentralization, said Grant Gulovsen, an attorney who advises startups in the crypto sector.      He said crypto startups can absolutely benefit from the safe harbor proposal, though he noted that existing crowdfunding regulations (Regulation CF) allow startups to raise over $1 million provided they meet certain conditions.      “I’d be in favor of relaxing the restrictions across the board, but it doesn’t make sense to me from a public policy standpoint to create such an uneven playing field that benefits crypto startups because blockchain, especially given the low threshold required to meet Network Maturity under the Token Safe Harbor’s functional network test,” he said.      Lin told CoinDesk the revisions were mostly “wonderful,” pointing to the disclosure and reporting interval requirements.      However, she said the guidance could be more specific on the exit guidance by defining who can determine whether a project is decentralized or functional, and what might disqualify a project.      “In the end, network maturity will still be a subjective standard. Thus it’d be useful to have more info on how it’ll be judged and what factors are most important,” she said, adding, “Given the consequences are so severe, it’d also be useful to lay out an appeals process. These items don’t necessarily have to be written in the rule itself, but it’d be helpful to have guidance to provide more clarity.”      Lin said she does hope “Network Maturity” might be more clearly defined, or precedents created to more clearly establish.    Soliciting feedback    One of the most novel moves Peirce made was posting the entire updated proposal on GitHub, a popular hosting platform for software where anyone can provide feedback by way of comments or suggest changes through pull requests.      This was “a brilliant idea,” said Gulovsen, who has already posted comments on the GitHub page. “I applaud Commissioner Peirce for posting it on GitHub. It gives legal practitioners, software developers and any interested parties an opportunity to comment directly on the proposal and creates a completely transparent public record.”      The move also allows developers, lawyers and other parties to respond directly rather than have to go through lobbyists to propose suggestions, he said.      Pierce said she posted the proposal on GitHub “to really encourage people to engage with the text and think about how to improve it.”      She also hopes that it will help show new SEC Chair Gary Gensler how much engagement there is, and what issues people believe could be improved.      Peirce solicited feedback for the original proposal as well, and said the comments she received in the last year showed people do want a safe harbor.      “I think it’s just a piece of the clarity question because whether or not something has to be traded as a security matters for people in the [industry], it matters for broker-dealers,” she said. “We have a pilot program that is available now and that, too, is only available for digital asset securities so we have to be thinking about whether or not things fit within what bucket.”    Regulation by enforcement    Part of the safe harbor idea is to help the SEC move away from “regulation by enforcement,” which is when the regulator brings enforcement actions against what it perceives as wrongdoers and lets the rest of the industry try to piece together what behavior is acceptable.This approach does not provide clear guidance on what is permissible.      “There are always questions around whether we’re leading with enforcement or whether instead of doing that could we provide some regulatory clarity,” Peirce said.      Peirce said she published the proposal ahead of Gensler’s final confirmation votes, noting that he has past experience in the crypto sector.      “I hope he will be thinking about how to provide regulatory clarity with respect to crypto generally,” she said. “I’d like this to be something he considers.”    The Coinbase roller coaster    Last week, U.S.-based crypto exchange Coinbase finally went public, marking Wall Street’s most public acceptance of a crypto startup to date. You can catch all of CoinDesk’s coverage here, but in short: Trading began early afternoon, the price went up a bit, then went down a bit and it’s trading around $330 as of Monday.      The listing reverberated beyond just the U.S. as well – as my colleague Sandali Handagama wrote. Execs at crypto exchanges in different countries see the listing as a signal to the traditional financial world and its members, who may now take the digital asset industry more seriously.      Now, we get to wait and see which company is next and whether that marks a further acceptance of crypto by Wall Street – or, a further acceptance of Wall Street by crypto.    The Biden Bunch  Changing of the guard    Gary Gensler has officially been confirmed as leader of the Securities and Exchange Commission. It only took three months and three different votes. Now, to paraphrase the immortal words of Bill Belichick, we’re on to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. No official word on who might be tapped to lead the commodities regulator or the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.    Elsewhere:  Binance.US Hires Former Bank Regulator Brian Brooks as CEO: Brian Brooks is joining Binance.US. I was a bit surprised but I guess this isn't wholly unexpected. (Also, no word on where soon-to-be-former CEO Catherine Coley is headed.)  The NFT Craze Is Helping Nigerian Artists Go Global: Some Nigerian artists are minting non-fungible tokens of their art and finding that this is easier than trying to break into the traditional art market. Sandali Handagama spoke to some of these artists to get their perspective, though, as she notes, NFTs may only benefit artists with established fanbases, not up-and-comers.  US Policy Adviser Rebuts Peter Thiel: Bitcoin Won’t Undermine USD: Yeah, so the other week Peter Thiel, longtime bitcoin hodler, said China might use bitcoin to undermine the U.S. dollar. It was an odd statement, but last week Alex Wong, a member of the congressionally-funded U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, said this was unlikely.  Much Wow: Slim Jim Has a Dogecoin Strategy: So Slim Jim, a subsidiary of Conagra Brands, has a Dogecoin strategy, according to my colleague Daniel Nelson. This was somehow CoinDesk’s most-read story last week. More saliently, I’m wondering whether this is an actual sign of acceptance. Dogecoin has been treated as a meme since its creation; now, actual companies that are listed on actual stock exchanges are planning marketing campaigns around significant dates for DOGE fans. Maybe this is what real institutional adoption looks like. Or maybe I'm overthinking this and people just like memes.  Outside CoinDesk:  (Los Angeles Times) I talked about IP issues for non-fungible tokens a while back, and some of my colleagues have covered how new or less prominent artists are taking advantage of the form to sell art and make money. The Los Angeles Times looked at artists who tried, but were beaten back by industry – in this case, the comic book industry. While comic book artists have sometimes been able to sell their art at conventions and other locations with no problem, it seems that IP protections will keep them from doing the same in this particular digital format.  (Motherboard) The FBI received court approval to basically hack computers in order to remove compromised software tied to a Microsoft Exchange Server version. The move was done to protect companies from future hacks, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. I’ve got a few questions about this. Maybe the FBI believed it had no choice but to break into private entities’ computers and patch them, but the fact this was possible both technically and legally is concerning, to say the least.  (IFLR) I wrote about the revisited Financial Action Task Force draft proposal the other week. Lewis Cohen, a co-founder of DLx Law who’s well known in this industry, published a much more comprehensive analysis of what the draft proposal says and what the implications are.

42434224,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPA7vh,1618930800,A16z Leads $28M Funding Round for Data Privacy Platform Aleo,"In its effort to launch a platform for programmable data privacy, startup Aleo has received some serious financial backing in the form of a $28 million fundraising round led by venture-capital firm a16z (Andreesen Horowitz) and with participation from Placeholder VC, Galaxy Digital, Variant Fund and Coinbase Ventures, among others.      Aleo’s pitch is about developing a web platform that leverages zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), a cryptographic technique that allows two parties on the internet, such as an app and a user, to verify information with each other without sharing the underlying data related to that information.    Read more: Startup Aleo Wants to Help You Use the Internet Without Sacrificing Data Privacy    As part of that goal, the team is building a platform to appeal to developers while giving them the tools to keep privacy at the core of whatever apps they create – even if they don’t have a background in blockchain or expertise in cryptography.    The data privacy trade-off    In technology, privacy features are often at odds with convenience. Password managers have become much easier to use, but people sometimes still think it’s simpler to use the same password across most of the sites they use every day, even if doing so is much less secure.      By appealing to developers, rather than creating their own app or the like, Aleo’s platform is intended to foster further privacy applications and use cases that are easier for both developers and users to employ.      Typically, web applications run much of the quiet processes online through back-end servers (like Amazon Web Services), from identity verification to payment portals. Aleo allows developers to incorporate privacy functionality more easily into those processes. The idea is to build out a back-end ecosystem that goes beyond just creating another consumer privacy app, like a virftual private network users can download from the Google Play Store, for example.      Developers can port their apps into Aleo’s platform, which will immediately improve the privacy functionality of those apps by leveraging zero-knowledge proofs. Alternatively, they can build their apps from the ground up right on the platform.    How Aleo enhances data privacy    Rather than requiring a user to share data with a web app, apps using Aleo ensure that data is protected directly on the user's device and verified rather than shared with the service provider.      In a blog post explaining its work on data privacy, Aleo said that “rather than risk leaking a user's password, users can now hash their password on-device, without ever having to send their password over to any web service.”      Incorporating zero-knowledge proofs into apps would allow for this strategy, mitigate the impact of data breaches, keep user data private and help with regulatory compliance. These are just a few of the value-adds that Aleo sees itself as offering.      The funding is accompanied by the launch of Aleo’s Developer Preview II, a line of new tools for developers to build on Aleo ahead of the public launch of the network. Aleo’s testnet1 has successfully mined more than 200,000 blocks with block times now at 30 seconds (down from 80 seconds).    Read more: The Web Wasn’t Built for Privacy, but It Could Be    In an email to CoinDesk, Aleo CEO Howard Wu said the most important thing for people to understand is Aleo’s value proposition for both users and developers.      For users, he said, Aleo is the first platform for fully private applications. Aleo uses decentralized systems and zero-knowledge cryptography to deliver a user experience on the web that is both personal and private.      For developers, on the other hand, Aleo is a full-stack web framework for zero-knowledge applications, he added.    A16z funding    “Our fundraise is one of the largest first rounds for any ZK project to date,” said Wu.      Katie Haun, general partner at a16z, said in a statement that data privacy-preserving applications allow users to navigate digital interactions without bias, which, coupled with blockchain technology, will create new opportunities to create value.      “Aleo's tech has solved critical issues in scaling applications built with zero-knowledge technology, enabling any developer or organization to build and scale a truly private application,"" she said.      Wu said the funds will be used for community growth and for starting a developer grants program and expanding the Aleo's engineering team as it produces the first full-stack framework for zero-knowledge and prep for mainnet launch.      “This fundraise will allow us to seed a developer grants program to grow our ecosystem of Leo developers and Aleo core developers,” Wu said. “It will enable us to begin actively engaging and cultivating our ZK community and become a resource for education around various aspects of zero-knowledge technology.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | ZK,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/04/20/a16z-leads-28m-funding-round-for-data-privacy-platform-aleo,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f1ba91236e082ac5074d2e15a84d89eae5f2dd6c-2560x2011.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It’s worth noting that SDX is being built using R3’s blockchain tech, as per a long-standing agreement between the firms. However, Grant, a former R3 executive, seemed to play down the relationship.      “We use R3's blockchain for our CSD (central securities depository), and there are reasons why we made that decision a couple of years ago,” Grant said in an interview. “We’ve got to look beyond just CSD. Asset flow matters to us, and the R3 Corda ecosystem doesn't have anything like the kind of traction from an asset perspective that the Ethereum ecosystem has.”    Read more: Ethereum Hub ConsenSys Raises $65M From JPMorgan, Mastercard, UBS, Others    Once a consortia-happy, proof-of-concept playground for banks and blue chips, enterprise blockchain has turned out to be something of a slow grind.

42434213,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPA7bh,1618923600,Conflux Launches Cross-Chain Bridge to Connect Asia's Largest Crypto Exchanges,"Conflux, a public blockchain endorsed by the Shanghainese government, is launching a cross-chain bridge to facilitate easier operations among three of Asia’s largest crypto exchanges – Binance, OKEx and Huobi – as well as Ethereum.      The cross-chain bridge, called ShuttleFlow, will enable digital asset swaps between and across the Conflux network, Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Huobi ECO Chain and OKex Chain, the firm announced Tuesday. In other words, a user can take an asset on one of these networks and convert it into an asset on a different one.      The ShuttleFlow solution is the first cross-chain bridge to support Asia’s most widely used digital asset exchanges, according to a press statement shared with CoinDesk.      “The name ‘ShuttleFlow’ means allowing assets to flow between multiple public chains as freely as water,” Eden Dhaliwal, global managing director at Conflux, told CoinDesk via an email.      Increasingly more crypto firms are coming up with cross-chain liquidity and interoperability solutions for decentralized finance (DeFi). Earlier this month, decentralized liquidity network Thorchain launched cross-chain trading of cryptocurrencies. In March, Alameda Research invested $20 million in cross-chain DeFi platform Reef Finance.      ShuttleFlow’s multi-chain capabilities are twofold, Dhaliwal explained. First, it provides decentralized app (dapp) developers with solutions to integrate multi-chain asset deposits and withdrawals at a low cost, he said.      “As a project, the Conflux Foundation has historically covered all or most of the Ethereum gas fees associated with transactions, in order to facilitate the onboarding of new users who typically experiment with lower dollar amounts,” Dhaliwal said, adding that now, dapps building on Conflux can sponsor transactions with their own CFX (Conflux's native token), or open it up as a donation and let users cover the gas fees.      Since the launch of the mainnet, there have been over 5 million transactions with a combined gas cost of just $90 across the entire chain, Dhaliwal added.      Second, ShuttleFlow uses the Conflux Network as a “transit chain” to build asset bridges and other related infrastructure across DeFi blockchains, Dhaliwal said. This means the solution can facilitate swaps directly between two external blockchains like Ethereum and Binance, according to the statement shared with CoinDesk.      A testnet version of ShuttleFlow was launched in the first quarter of 2020, supporting over 49 assets including bitcoin and ether, the statement said. In September 2020, the first cross-chain multi-asset migration of digital assets (worth over $7.6 million) was completed.      Since then the ShuttleFlow protocol has moved over $120 million in assets, Dhaliwal said.",POSITIVE,CFX,ASIA | ETH | EXCHANGE | BNB | CFX,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/20/conflux-launches-cross-chain-bridge-to-connect-asias-largest-crypto-exchanges,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/379280efd55be568aa3e96533870169cb1d0854b-640x640.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42434219,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPA7lh,1618923600,Balancer Labs Offers $2M Bug Bounty to Spot Vulnerabilities,"Non-custodial portfolio manager Balancer Labs is launching a bug bounty with a 1,000 ETH or $2 million top prize.      In a statement shared with CoinDesk, Balancer Labs claimed the $2 million bounty is the largest single bug bounty in history, and that the prize will hopefully incentivize ethical hackers to discover and report vulnerabilities in the Balancer V2 Vault architecture, which will be available to developers starting Tuesday.      The V2 vault, which isn’t live yet, is a single vault that holds and manages all the assets entrusted to the platform, designed to dramatically reduce gas fees by making transactions simpler.      “What would have been multiple transactions before, each resulting in gas fees, will now be a single transaction,” Balancer Labs CEO Fernando Martinelli told CoinDesk via a written statement.      The bug bounty for the newly released V2 single-vault comes after Balancer Labs fell victim to a cyberattack that tricked its protocol into releasing $500,000 worth of tokens in June 2020. Balancer Labs is looking to reward discoveries like the draining of significant funds from the Vault, permanent locking of significant funds in the Vault or for discovering severe rounding errors where an attacker can steal funds in excess of any gas costs or swap fees, according to the firm’s announcement.      Bug bounties are increasingly becoming an attractive revenue stream for security researchers, and an efficient way for tech firms to identify weaknesses in their products. In 2020, Google announced it had paid over $21 million in bug bounties under its vulnerability reward program since 2010, spending $6.5 million in 2019 alone. In 2020, hackers from dozens of countries earned up to $40 million just by identifying system vulnerabilities for various organizations.      Decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms like Balancer Labs are increasingly vulnerable to hacks and theft. According to a report by crypto sleuth CipherTrace, in the second half of 2020 half of all targeted entities for crypto-related hacks were DeFi platforms, making up 14% of total hacked volume (amounting to $47.7 million).      In March this year, DeFi platform DODO DEX was drained of $3.8 million in a cyber attack. Last year, $25 million worth of assets were taken from DeFi platform dForce, although most of the stolen funds were returned to the platform a couple of days following the incident.      The Balancer Labs vulnerability tests are scheduled for late April, while further instructions are available on its website.      “Apart from being the largest on record, our bug bounty is innovative in that it scales as ETH goes up, in correlation with the broad crypto market and likely with the total value locked in Balancer protocol. The more there is at stake, the higher we believe our bug bounty rewards should be,” Martinelli said in the announcement.",POSITIVE,ETH,BAL | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MINING,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/20/balancer-labs-offers-2m-bug-bounty-to-spot-vulnerabilities,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b6232625a5536ece557f504e3f06d5f1061872fd-509x339.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Short-term put options on bitcoin, or bearish bets, are drawing higher prices than calls, or bullish bets. The one-week ""put-call skew,"" which measures this dynamic, has jumped to 26%, the highest since Oct. 2, according to data provider Skew. The one-month gauge has risen to a three-week high of 8%.      Bitcoin (BTC) tumbled 6.3% on Sunday, the biggest single-day decline in almost two months, after disruptions at coal plants in Xinjiang and other parts of China last week knocked out bitcoin miners in the region. The Bitcoin blockchain's hash rate – the amount of computing power devoted to securing the network – slid by 46% to 106 exahashes (quintillion computations) per second, the lowest since November.      Bitcoin was trading near $56,300 at press time after sliding as low as $53,400 earlier Tuesday, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      The put-call skew is a gauge of the value of puts relative to calls; a positive skew implies that demand for puts (bearish options bets) is outstripping calls (bullish bets).      Positive one-week and one-month skews do not necessarily mean that traders have turned bearish on the cryptocurrency. They could be buying ""protective puts"" – purchasing puts against long bitcoin positions in the spot or futures market.      ""Puts at $52,000 and $54,000 strikes for April 23 and April 23 expiry have been in demand since last week, which has caused the short-term skews to go into positive territory,"" Swiss-based data tracker Laevitas told CoinDesk.      Some institutional investors bought bitcoin on Sunday as prices dipped to $51,248.      ""Our desk has been a net purchaser over the past 24-48 hours,"" Greg Cipolaro, global head of research at NYDIG, a bitcoin-focused investment manager, wrote Monday in an email to subscribers.      Some bitcoin buyers may have bought put options for downside protection, pushing up the put-call skew. The one-week gauge has increased from roughly 6% since Sunday      While demand for short-term puts has spiked, long-term put-call skews remain well below zero, indicating continued bias for calls.      Some bitcoin miners may also have been purchasers of downside protection, traders said.      ""The trend in the hashrate does have a positive correlation with the price movement but usually on a longer-term perspective,"" Marcie Terman, COO of crypto hedge fund Panxora Group said in a LinkedIn chat. ""Our risk models use it as one of the inputs, and it has a positive correlation weight.""      Terman added that the decline in the Bitcoin blockchain's hash rate was very pronounced over the last week and easily could have triggered some selling if algorithm-powered investment funds were at a tipping point already due to other factors.

The pilot will be launched with a single stablecoin pegged to the U.S dollar, CNBC reported Tuesday, citing a person familiar with the matter.  It will be based largely on payments between individual consumers, potentially with the option for users to buy goods and services.  The Diem project is currently in talks with Swiss regulators to secure a payment license.  Originally named Libra when announced by Facebook in 2019, the project has experienced intense scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators and witnessed the departure of a string of partners.  This culminated in the Libra Association scaling back its ambitions in April 2020, pivoting to the development of a number of stablecoins pegged to different currencies, as opposed to the original plan of a global digital currency backed by a basket of national currencies.

42434250,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPA7rh,1618916906,Silvergate Execs Pressed by Analysts on Yield From Crypto Customer Deposits,"Analysts on Silvergate Bank’s Q1 earnings call pressed executives on how the crypto-friendly institution will make more money on excess cash in a low-interest rate environment, despite the company's gangbusters results.      The La Jolla, Calif.-based bank, which serves major crypto firms such as Coinbase, Gemini and Kraken, added a record 135 digital currency customers in Q1--more than it added in all of 2020. Crypto firms are often a rich source of low-cost deposits for the few banks that openly serve the sector. In Q1, Silvergate’s average cost of deposits was 0.00%. In contrast, average deposit costs for mid-cap commercial banks are normally around 0.75% to 1.25%.      However, analysts on Tuesday’s call were especially curious about what Silvergate was doing to increase interest income from customers like stablecoin issuers, the day after Circle announced that Silvergate banking rival Signature would become its primary banking partner to hold USD Coin deposits.      Silvergate CEO Alan Lane said that while Silvergate allows stablecoin issuers to mint and burn stablecoins on the Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN), the bank's fiat on-ramp for bitcoin markets, it isn't interested in being the primary bank for stablecoin reserves which would double or triple the bank’s balance sheet size.      “We're in the lowest interest rate environment in my lifetime,” Lane said. “There's not a lot of places that you can go to earn yield on that excess cash.”      Bank analysts also pushed the bankers on what they would do with the excess cash Silvergate had raked in from the rest of its digital currency customers. Lane noted that while the bank could “juice short-term earnings” by putting the deposits into high-yield, longer-duration securities, it wouldn’t be sustainable long term because crypto firms want to use SEN as a highly liquid network to use as a fiat on ramp for trading on nights and weekends.      “It’s not that we don’t have comfort in putting the cash out,” Lane said in regards to lending out deposits for crypto customers. “All of that gets calibrated in how we manage our liquidity, and I’m very confident that over time we will be generating a nice net interest income in addition to growing fee income.”      By the numbers      The tough questioning from analysts came despite big gains in fee income and transaction revenue.      The SEN processed 166,772 transactions and transferred $166.5 billion over the network during Q1, up 83% and 181% respectively. Q1 net income was $12.7 million, up 40% over Q4.      Fee income driven by cash management accounts for crypto firms rose to $7.1 million from $3.8 million in the previous quarter.      The bank’s average total digital currency deposits during Q1 were $6.4 billion, the high and low daily total digital currency deposit levels were $8.4 billion and $4.6 billion, respectively. Overall, digital currency customer deposits grew by $1.8 billion in the quarter.      The bank’s Tier 1 leverage ratio – which measures equity capital against risk-weighted assets – remained well above the regulatory threshold of 5% at 9.68%.      Lending      SEN Leverage, Silvergate’s bitcoin-backed lending business that is tied to the SEN, is another place for the bank to deploy new deposits in addition to its traditional commercial real estate (CRE) lending business. The bank processed $117.3 million in SEN Leverage loans in Q1, a 52% increase from the previous quarter and monumental increase from the $2 million in bitcoin-backed loans it did in the same quarter last year. Silvergate’s total loans--including traditional CRE--were $1.6 billion at the end of the last quarter.      Approved credit lines for SEN Leverage increased to $196.5 million in Q1, up from $82.5 million in the prior quarter. In March, the bank announced that it would be extending bitcoin-backed loans to Fidelity clients, and it already works with Coinbase Custody, Bitstamp and Anchorage. Partnering with custodians also gives Silvergate more exposure to new institutional customers who are looking for leverage, added Chief Strategy Officer Ben Reynolds.      Noninterest expense has increased by 11% quarter-over-quarter, which included research and development expenses for new products coming in the future, Reynolds added.      “Bitcoin grew by approximately $500 billion during the first quarter alone,” Reynolds saaid. “At the same time, we’re not aware of any significant new competitors that are willing to provide US dollar funding that’s collateralized by bitcoin. While the asset values of bitcoin and the demand for leverage increased significantly, the supply of US dollars for funding and leverage remain constant.”      While less than 10% of the 695 institutions banking with Silvergate are currently taking advantage of SEN, the bank does expect at least 80% of those customers to use the product over time, Reynolds said.      Lane described his intention to create a “network of custodians” so that customers don’t have to move their bitcoin when the bank is offering cash loans against it.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/20/silvergate-execs-pressed-by-analysts-on-yield-from-crypto-customer-deposits,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3896ee7d0f100ad863524781dc363b0d33add388-1500x851.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

After stepping down from the public sector on Jan. 14, 2021, crypto observers have been watching closely for where Brooks would land. In March, he joined the board of data-sharing startup Spring Labs. The Binance.US move is clearly far more significant.      Current Binance.US CEO Catherine Coley will depart the company by the beginning of May, Brooks confirmed in a CoinDesk TV appearance on Tuesday.      “Not because she hasn't done a terrific job,” Brooks said. “Generally speaking, you want to keep these things small and nimble.”      Under Brooks, the OCC published a number of interpretative letters on how national banks can interact with the cryptocurrency space, with particular attention paid to stablecoins and their issuers. Should banks take full advantage of these interpretative letters, they’ll be able to conduct payments using stablecoins, provide custody services for cryptocurrencies and partner with or acquire crypto custody providers. The Wall Street Journal first reported the news of Brooks’ hiring.      He also oversaw the conditional approval of the first federal bank charter to go to a crypto-native company, when Anchorage was granted a trust charter by the federal regulator.      “This is the company that's most likely to give the biggest incumbent Coinbase a run for its money,” Brooks said on CoinDesk TV. “It's the best opportunity to build a fully compliant, but product-diversified crypto platform in the U.S., and it's a company that has been, you know, revenue and profit positive since day one because of the resourcing [it] had got at the inception.”      Binance, which “licenses its matching engine and wallet technologies to Binance.US,” according to a Tuesday press release, welcomed the move.      “Brian is an esteemed leader with an unparalleled blend of experience across traditional financial services, government, and the digital assets industry,” Binance founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao said in a statement. “His knowledge and expertise will be invaluable as Binance.US continues to expand.”    Departing exec    Soon-to-be-former CEO Coley did not respond to a request for comment by press time. Brooks confirmed her departure from the exchange and its managing board however.      Before Binance.US, Coley was head of XRP Institutional Liquidity at Ripple, which she joined after working for Morgan Stanley Foreign Exchange desks in Hong Kong and London.      “The other thing you'll see over time is we will quickly migrate into more value-add services and be a more diversified platform not just crypto-asset trading but of other kinds of services based on our ability to access licenses and to achieve compliance very quickly,” Brooks said.      Though he did not specifically reference it, Binance (the international one, not the U.S. version) recently listed tokens representing fractions of real-life stocks, including Tesla and Coinbase. These tokens allow holders to earn dividend rewards, backed by the actual stock which Binance said was managed by a German investment firm.

42434220,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPA7nh,1618902000,Celo Network Adds Deutsche Telekom as Partner; German Telco Buys ‘Significant’ CELO Position,"Deutsche Telekom AG, Europe’s largest telecommunications company by revenue, is now wholeheartedly backing the next generation of blockchain networks having chosen Celo, the mobile-first decentralized payments network, to throw its weight behind.      Announced Tuesday, Deutsche Telekom has made “a significant purchase” of Celo’s native asset, CELO, which was handled by the Telekom Innovation Pool (TIP) and advised by Deutsche Telekom Capital Partners (DTCP). The company did not disclose the size of its investment.      The German telecommunications giant and operator of T-Mobile appears to be ahead of the blue-chip crowd when it comes to having skin in the game for proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains. Deutsche Telekom will be staking 100% of its CELO investment, using the telco’s infrastructure and with its own validators, and earning about 6% return in terms of staking rewards, said Andreas Dittrich, head of the Blockchain Solutions Center at Deutsche Telekom.      Deutsche Telekom is already one of the major infrastructure providers to Chainlink, the preferred data oracle of decentralized finance (DeFi), and has also dipped its toe into staking (holding assets on a blockchain network and earning rewards for helping validate transactions) on the Flow blockchain, built by NBA Top Shot firm Dapper Labs.      However, Celo marks the first time the telco has covered investment, infrastructure support and use case building in one go.      “It might look like Deutsche Telekom is investing a significant sum in some weird altcoin,” joked Dittrich, adding:    “We’re not doing this to make some money. We are going to be invested for years to come to support this network with a focus on infrastructure. The Celo protocol is very attractive to us as a telco because every phone number is linked to the wallet of a customer.”    There’s currently a billion dollars worth of stake securing the Celo network, and 100 validators, according to Rene Reinsberg, co-founder of Celo.    Read more: Former Citigroup Chairman Joins Board of Crypto Payments Firm Celo    The validator group with the most votes at this time is regulated custodian Anchorage, resulting in about 15 million CELO pointed at them. This works out as about $60 million worth of stake elected to be run by those validators, said Reinsberg.      “Deutsche Telekom is such a large and trusted consumer brand it's going to be interesting to see how much stake will be pointed at the validator,” Reinsberg said in an interview.    Celo’s mobile-first approach    Celo uses mobile phone numbers a bit like public keys on other blockchains in that you can send money to the phone and it gets stored in a Celo wallet. The network also uses stablecoins to facilitate payments and transfers. Celo launched a euro stablecoin on Tuesday to complement the system’s existing dollar stablecoin.      The network has been compared to the Diem stablecoin project (formerly known as Libra), but Celo is unique in its attention to a light mobile client, hence the synergy with mobile carriers, said Reinsberg.      For example, Deutsche Telekom is opening an SMS API gateway on Celo where an additional layer of SMS infrastructure will create something like two-factor authentication on top of the phone-wallet architecture, but done in a decentralized fashion.      “Two-factor authentication is a really neat feature,” said Reinsberg, “but rather than having a central service send that message, here it’s a randomly selected set of validators sending these messages to the users, allowing them to associate their phone number with their public key.”    Read more: Chainlink Supporter Deutsche Telekom Has Quietly Started Staking on Blockchains    Previously, Deutsche Telekom had been working with BaFIN-regulated custodian Finoa to handle cryptocurrency. But the telco’s blockchain staking and DeFi capabilities have since expanded to the point where it no longer requires an external partner, explained Dittrich in an interview.      “Strategically, we think this is where telcos are supposed to be when it comes to providing digital infrastructure,” Dittrich, the Blockchain Solutions Center lead, said. “We are just the first of the big ones to jump on the train. Of course, we’re happy that we can run this in a profitable way. But this is really just the beginning of the journey.”",POSITIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | LINK | FLOW,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/04/20/celo-network-adds-deutsche-telekom-as-partner-german-telco-buys-significant-celo-position,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ace30c1c0f41dd77d2e4a2b85d91cad451aca541-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
