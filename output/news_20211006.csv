42396810,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT5MW2,1633559411,"Coinbase Likely to Top Q3 Trading, Revenue Estimates on Bitcoin Volatility: Oppenheimer","Coinbase (Nasdaq: COIN) is likely to top consensus estimates for trading volume and total revenue for the third quarter due to recent volatility in the price of bitcoin, according to Oppenheimer analyst Owen Lau.  Lau estimates there is an 18% potential upside to trading volume and an 11% upside to total revenue estimates, citing the exchange’s “substantially” improved trading volume in the second half of the third quarter.  Coinbase shares had a “rough” September with the stock down 12.2% versus the S&P 500′s 4.8% dip – likely hurt by increased regulatory scrutiny, the retreat of bitcoin, the company’s move to preemptively end its Lend product, its $2 billion debt raise and macro risks associated with Evergrande in China.  “With all the news driving volatility, trading volume has substantially improved in late August and September,” Lau wrote in a note.  Lau, who has an outperform rating on the shares and a $444 price target, estimates that Coinbase has $6.5 billion in cash as of the third quarter that can be potentially used for new product development, M&A, diversification and increased balance sheet investment in crypto.  Late last month, JMP Securities was also bullish on Coinbase shares, putting a $300 price target and market outperform rating on the shares.  COIN shares are currently trading at around $250.

42410973,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggttdu,1633559360,Gensler’s Crypto Testimony: 6 Key Takeaways,"U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler was on the hot seat on Tuesday during a House Financial Services Committee oversight hearing, and many committee members – 19 of them – took the opportunity to ask Gensler about crypto regulation.  The committee’s focus on crypto revealed the fascination – and pent-up frustration – with the growing crypto industry and the SEC’s role in regulating it.  Gensler’s testimony covered crypto exchanges, stablecoins, decentralized finance (DeFi) and more. CoinDesk breaks it down below.  The SEC’s regulatory authority  Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), the committee’s top Republican, questioned Gensler about his “concerning and contradictory” statements about crypto regulation and whether the SEC has the authority it needs to regulate crypto.  In May, Gensler told Congress that the SEC would need additional legislation to regulate and define digital assets and exchanges, but McHenry pointed out on Tuesday that in subsequent interviews with the media, Gensler’s position on that has changed: The SEC chairman now posits that the SEC has the authority it needs to regulate crypto under existing legislation.  “I think that the SEC’s authorities in this space are clear,” Gensler told McHenry. “I think that Congress painted with a broad brush for the definition of ‘security’, and included 30 or 35 separate areas that are within the definition of a security to protect the public against fraud.”  Gensler told McHenry that Congress could help “fill gaps” in the coordination between the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).  Despite the seemingly brewing turf war between the CFTC and SEC over crypto regulation, Gensler was clear in his opinion that Congress doesn’t need to create another regulatory body to oversee crypto.  ”We don’t need another regulator,” he said. “There are things that can be done to ensure the smoothness between the two agencies … even if Congress doesn’t act.”  Gensler also commented on the SEC’s shrinking budget and reiterated his request that Congress provide additional funding to the SEC so that it can hire more staff and upgrade its data analytics software.  “We’ve shrunk about 4 or 5% in the last four or five years. I would have hoped that we might have grown 4 or 5% at this period of time,” Gensler said. “I know resources are tight, but it would help us to do our mission.”  Are cryptocurrencies securities?  When asked by McHenry and other committee members whether he considered cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether to be securities, Gensler dodged the question. ”I’m not going to get into any one token,” Gensler said. “But I think that the securities laws are quite clear. If you’re raising money from somebody else, and the investing public has a reasonable anticipation of profits based on the efforts of others, that fits within the securities law.”  Gensler testified that “most” of the 5,000-6,000 existing cryptocurrencies fall under the definition of a security and are thus subject to regulation by the SEC – a similar position to that of his predecessor Jay Clayton.  Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), chairman of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus and a vocal supporter of the crypto industry, pushed back against Gensler’s assertion, saying that he considers most cryptos to fall under the definition of a commodity or currency.  Rep. Warren Davidson (R-Ohio), another member of the blockchain caucus, asked Gensler what it would take for cryptocurrencies to go from being securities to being commodities or currencies, referencing 2018 statements in which Gensler said that ether could be “off the hook” from being considered a security because it had switched to a decentralized network.  “You’ve repeatedly said that you believe initial coin offerings (ICOs) are securities,” Davidson said. “Can you clarify when a token is sufficiently decentralized to no longer be a security in your view?”  Gensler refused to comment on ether or any other specific token, instead saying that any token that passed the Howey Test would be considered a security.  Gensler is coming for the exchanges  In response to a question from Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.), Gensler discussed his reasoning for focusing on regulating trading and lending platforms, including decentralized ones.  “Investors are basically giving ownership rights up. They transfer what’s called a private key to the platform … and the platforms take custody,” Gensler said.  Gensler continued, saying:  “I think that such a tremendous amount of activity happens there, and it’s a place where we could get better investor protection … even in the decentralized platforms, or so-called DeFi platforms, there is a centralized protocol. And though they don’t take custody in the same way, those are the places where we can get the maximum amount of public policy.”  Gensler repeatedly urged exchanges to register with the SEC, something he has done in past appearances, and decried the exodus of exchanges to friendlier jurisdictions.  “I think firms should just come in and register,” Gensler said. “But what’s happened over the last four or five years is they’ve either chosen not to or they’ve stood up in Singapore or Malta or Hong Kong or other countries and offered their services indirectly through a virtual private network.”  Rep. Anthony Gonzalez (R-Ohio) pointed out that simply “coming in and registering” with the SEC might not be feasible for some exchanges.  “I’ve been speaking with multiple companies in the space, and the common theme in these discussions is that they want to come in and describe their product to the SEC; however, they’re concerned that these meetings could lead to a potential enforcement action,” Gonzalez said. “This sort of friendly open door conversation is not something they believe they’re experiencing.”  When asked his thoughts on investment platforms like Robinhood that offer digital assets alongside stocks, Gensler stressed the need for crypto exchanges to register with the SEC.  “I think if we don’t get these exchanges, these lending platforms inside of the public policy framework, a lot of people are gonna be hurt,” Gensler said. “I think it’s clear that many of these projects are within the securities laws. We’re gonna use our authorities to try to get more of these projects and companies to register and be within the investor protection framework.”  Coming stablecoin regulation  Though Gensler asserted several times during Tuesday’s hearing that the SEC already has sufficient authority to regulate cryptocurrencies, he suggested that Congress could be helpful in deciding how to regulate “stable-value coins.”  When asked if he considered stablecoins a systemic risk to the U.S. economy, Gensler doubled down on his previous analogy comparing stablecoins to “poker chips” at a crypto “casino.”  “I think the $125 billion of stablecoins we have right now are like the poker chips at a casino, and I think they create risks in the system,” Gensler said. “Yes, I think if this continues to grow – and it’s grown about 10-fold in the past year – it can present those system-wide risks.”  The statements came hours after CoinDesk first revealed that Circle, a key backer of the USDC stablecoin along with Coinbase, had been hit with an investigative subpoena from the SEC’s enforcement division.  “You can see where it could start to undermine things if it continues to grow,” Gensler said. “[How it could] undermine traditional banking systems if it’s not brought inside the remit of banking.”  Read more:SEC Subpoenas USDC Stablecoin Backer Circle  Gensler, however, seemed to suggest that dollar-backed stablecoins with “clear and clean reserves” could be “different,” from what one representative called “junk coins” with unknown reserves.  “Wrapping something computer graphically around fiat money could be different, it could be directly around deposits at a bank or, at the other end of the spectrum, it could look a lot like a money market fund,” Gensler said. “It really depends on the underlying assets.”  Gensler also stressed that part of the SEC’s issue with stablecoins is that they have been used within exchanges “in part to avert laws around tax compliance and illicit activity.”  Crypto’s long-term outlook  Gensler also doubled down on previous statements he made to the Washington Post that he didn’t see a long-term future for the majority of crypto projects.  “It’s unlikely that 5,000 or 6,000 private forms of currency are gonna persist. Economic history tells us that’s unlikely. A handful might be competing with gold or silver as a digital speculative store of value … but not many of them. Most of them are speculative asset vehicles.”  Although Gensler repeatedly said he wouldn’t comment on any token in particular, he called bitcoin a store of value.  “Bitcoin … is a highly speculative asset, but it is a store of value that people wish to invest in as some would invest in gold,” he said.  No one is banning crypto (right now)  Rep. Ted Budd (R-N.C.) brought up China’s most recent crackdown against cryptocurrencies and crypto mining, and asked Gensler if the SEC was planning to implement similar bans.  After initially demurring, Gensler was forced to answer when Budd asked again directly: “But no bans that you’re interested in implementing via the SEC as China has done, really to funnel everyone through their own digital currency?”  “No, that would be up to Congress,” Gensler said.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/10/06/genslers-crypto-testimony-6-key-takeaways,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/afe824bc2a30a0ad1f83fcb63ba98f33c5a6145e-4971x3365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42424498,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2paph,1633558004,US FDIC Said to Be Studying Deposit Insurance for Stablecoins,"The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC), a key U.S. banking regulator, is studying whether certain stablecoins might be eligible for its coverage, five people familiar with the agency’s thinking said.  The discussions are preliminary, and it’s not clear what the timetable would be for making any policy decisions or how such changes would be communicated.  The agency is trying to analyze what so-called pass-through FDIC insurance might look like for the reserves that stablecoin issuers hold at banks, the sources said. Such coverage would insure holders of the tokens against losses up to $250,000 if the bank holding the collateral were to fail.  The FDIC is also looking at what regular, direct deposit insurance might look like for banks that want to issue stablecoins, people familiar with the discussions said.  “This is all part of a process by which they are trying to bring stablecoins into the banking system in a responsible manner,” one insider said. “It depends on what’s backing the stablecoins. If it’s backed by reserves at the Fed[eral Reserve] for cash then I think you just make the argument that it’s a deposit. If it’s backed by Treasurys [bonds], I think you’ll have a hard time treating it as a deposit.”  The discussions come amid a broader debate in the U.S. about potential stablecoin regulation. This week the Wall Street Journal reported (and CoinDesk confirmed) that the Biden administration would subject stablecoin issuers to bank-like regulations. Circle, issuer of USDC, the second-largest stablecoin, disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sent an investigative subpoena to the company in July.  $250K per customer  Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that are designed to trade at parity with government currencies, typically the U.S. dollar. The most popular kinds are backed by traditional financial assets such as cash in a bank or commercial paper, and are supposed to be redeemable 1-to-1 for cash on demand. The two largest stablecoins, Tether’s USDT and to a lesser degree USDC, have come under scrutiny recently over questions about their backing.  According to two other people familiar with cryptocurrency banking issues, stablecoin issuers don’t have the same kind of access to pass-through FDIC insurance that crypto exchanges have when they’re banking in the U.S. Exchanges can gain omnibus accounts where the funds that belong to each of their clients are insured up to $250,000 each but issuers of stablecoins don’t get these same kinds of protections.  “The FDIC is probably looking at whether stablecoins can count as deposits or whether someone’s ownership of a stablecoin is a deposit at the stablecoin issuer,” said Todd Phillips, a former FDIC lawyer who is now the director of financial regulation and corporate governance at the Center for American Progress, a Washington think tank.  The coverage could present challenges for issuers. Typically, these companies identify customers when they deposit cash for stablecoins or redeem the tokens for cash. But because stablecoins run on open, public blockchain networks (usually Ethereum), theoretically anyone with a crypto wallet that hasn’t been blacklisted can receive stablecoins from, and send them to, other wallets.  “One thing to remember is that each person has insurance of only up to $250,000,” said Phillips. “So, the stablecoin issuer would need to keep track of who is the current holder of their stablecoin and how many they own.”  Whatever the FDIC insures must not compromise the rest of the agency’s mission, he said.  “The FDIC basically has one overriding mission,- which is to ensure the safety of the Deposit Insurance Fund, the DIF,” Phillips said. “If the FDIC were to insure a stablecoin, that insurance would come out of the DIF and the FDIC will want to be very sure that they are on legal footing and that whatever they do doesn’t risk the DIF.”  Good Housekeeping seal  If the FDIC went ahead and provided deposit insurance for stablecoins, it would apply only if a bank that was banking a stablecoin issuer or that was issuing a stablecoin itself went into receivership. Even in this scenario, it’s rare that FDIC insurance would enter into the picture because the agency generally takes a failed bank’s assets and deposits and sells them to a healthy bank.  How the agency proceeds could potentially help protect consumers, Phillips added.  “The FDIC has strict rules as to which institutions may call themselves FDIC-insured or use the FDIC logo for advertising,” he said. “Just as how the FDIC’s logo on a bank’s website allows savers to be confident that the bank is safe, insurance of particular stablecoins and permission to use the FDIC logo would provide clarity about which stablecoins, up to the insurance limit, will not lose value.”  It’s likely that the agency will ask for public comment from the industry before any actual policy change is taken, Phillips said.  “I also imagine there are conversations going on between the four FDIC directors, since you need a majority of them to approve a new regulation,” he said.",NEUTRAL,USDT | USDC,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | REGULATION | USDT | USDC,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/10/06/us-fdic-said-to-be-studying-deposit-insurance-for-stablecoins,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/de9263e2c528788f9c16691e88a8a01579864cad-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421727,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXpGYf,1633557531,How to Talk to Your Legislator About the Crypto Safe Harbor,"Yesterday, Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-NC), the ranking member of the House Financial Services Committee, introduced a bill that would provide a “safe harbor” for crypto startups looking to raise capital through token sales. The bill is based on safe harbor rules laid out by U.S. Securities and Exchange Commissioner Hester Pierce, a longtime crypto ally.  The proposal is a nuanced attempt to square the circle at the heart of crypto network funding. The quandary goes something like this: If the token for a new network is classified as a security from the start, only institutional players and venture capitalists will be able to buy it. That makes it less likely that the network will have a truly decentralized user base or development community. On the other hand, you can’t give crypto carte blanche on securities regulation or you’ll wind up with rampant fraud, as we saw during the initial coin offering (ICO) boom in 2017.  David Z. Morris is CoinDesk’s chief insights columnist.  The Pierce/McHenry proposal would give new crypto startups three years to build and sell tokens without having them classified as securities. The goal would be to reach a level of “sufficient decentralization” during that window, allowing them to earn classification as a commodity – the conventional wisdom around bitcoin and ethereum – rather than a security. On the whole, it’s a proposal that seems very in tune with the way crypto networks grow.  But the proposal also includes a lot of the kinds of safeguards the SEC should want. In exchange for safe harbor, it requires projects to provide certain disclosures, including naming core team members. It also sets at least two key technical hurdles: Projects must have open-source code and be viewable with a block explorer. Those provisions would in themselves be huge anti-fraud measures, allowing projects to be fully community-vetted on ideas, execution and operations. Outright frauds like BitConnect or OneCoin would be unlikely to make it past the starting post.  After three years in this “safe harbor,” projects would have to evaluate their own progress toward decentralization and file a report with the SEC. If they fail to meet certain standards, such as development from outside of the core team, they then would have to register as a security within another three months. That would effectively be an admission that the growth of the system still depended mainly on the work of the core development team, meaning it would fail the Howey Test that defines a security.

Morris  Endorsements of the McHenry bill have come from industry groups, including the Chamber of Digital Commerce and Coin Center. It’s unclear what its political chances are, at least while Democrats still control both houses of Congress. But its introduction is an opportunity for politically motivated individuals and organizations to engage with their legislators on crypto. If you want to call or email, here’s contact information for the Senate and House offices.  You probably won’t get to talk to a human being (much less a senator), but the offices do track the volume of inbound comments they get on bills. Voicing support for the McHenry/Pierce crypto safe harbor proposal is one way to (maybe) help stave off what seems poised to become a much more aggressive regulatory regime under SEC Chairman Gary Gensler.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,David Z.

Recent monthly production updates from crypto miners such as Riot Blockchain and Marathon Digital Holdings show they have kept their mined bitcoins during September, when prices hovered around $40,000.  Riot Blockchain, the Castle Rock, Colo.-based miner, said in a statement Wednesday that as of Sept. 30 it holds 3,534 bitcoins, an increase of 406 bitcoins from August. Riot’s share price rose as much as 6.5% on Wednesday, before paring gains to close the trading session up about 1%.

It previously said the company held 6,695 bitcoins in August. Marathon’s stock was up 4.8% on Wednesday.  Adding to the trend, on Oct. 4, Canadian Hut 8 Mining Corp. also reported that all of its self-mined bitcoins were deposited into custody, which is consistent with the company’s strategy to “hodl” its mined digital currency. “We are thrilled with our current amount of bitcoin held in reserve as well as being ahead of schedule on our commitment to the market to have over 5,000 self-mined bitcoin by end of Q4,” said Jaime Leverton, CEO of Hut 8, in a statement.  The strategy of holding onto the digital currency is that in a bull run, doing so is likely to help miners’ balance sheets and bolster investors’ bullish sentiment on the overall sector. The miners are already enjoying continued profitability because the price of bitcoin has recovered from its recent decline and climbed about 88% this year.  Riot’s share price has climbed about 57% this year, while those of Marathon jumped 254% and Hut 8 risen 232%.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Aoyon Ashraf,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/10/06/crypto-miners-hoarding-bitcoins-as-price-surges-above-55000,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/202478585b000419ea84027e60011093dd5084b3-1024x683.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42424513,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2pbJh,1633555998,"Bitcoin Futures Premium on CME Surges, Hinting At Institutional Demand","Bitcoin’s latest breakout above $50,000 seems to be backed by renewed institutional buying.  Front-month bitcoin futures contracts based on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) are trading at an annualized premium of 12.8% to the spot price. That’s the highest level since mid-April and marks a significant rise from the discount of 0.36% seen a week ago, according to data provided by the derivatives research firm Skew.  The increase in premium “suggests that there is high demand among the CME traders to build long exposure in bitcoin at the moment,” Arcane Research’s weekly research note published Tuesday said. “The front-month contract on CME is by far the most frequently traded BTC futures contract on the exchange, and right now, bullish tendencies seem to be brewing on the institutional platform.”  The analyst community considers CME synonymous with institutions. These large entities prefer to trade futures of any product through an established and regulated exchange like the Chicago-based derivatives giant. Besides, CME’s regulated standard futures contracts trade in denominations of five BTC and require significant capital outlay typical for institutional investors.  Bitcoin was trading at about $50,650, up 5.14% for the week, after it rallied more than 10% last week. Expectations that the U.S. could soon approve a futures-based bitcoin exchange-traded fund are among the main factors powering the cryptocurrency higher.  ETF Store President Nate Geraci tweeted Monday that the first U.S.-listed futures ETF could be approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in two weeks. According to Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg Intelligence senior ETF analyst, there is a 75% chance of a futures-based ETF approval this month, most likely the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF on Oct. 18. The SEC kicked the can down the road on three physically backed bitcoin ETFs earlier this month.  “Rumors of a BTC ETF decision later in the month is spurring further demand,” Matthew Dibb, co-founder and chief operating officer of Stack Funds, said. “Bloomberg is betting on a 75% chance of an ETF this month; however, it is likely to be futures-based.”  “This rally coincides with anticipation of the Proshares ETF approval on Oct. 18,” Dibb said.  Analysts at Arcane Research said a futures-based ETF, if approved, could lead to further buying pressure on the front-month CME futures contract and a higher premium.  That’s because the ETF would gain exposure to bitcoin via regulated futures like those offered by the CME rather than buying the actual cryptocurrency. “An ETF backed by futures will simply buy the nearest dated futures contract and roll it at expiry,” Stack Funds’ Dibb said.  A continued rise in premium may entice carry traders, leading to more substantial demand in the spot market. Carry traders simultaneously enter into a long position in the spot market and a short position in the futures market in a bid to profit from an eventual convergence of the two prices on expiry. The higher the premium, the higher the return from carry trades.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/10/06/bitcoin-futures-premium-on-cme-surges-as-etf-speculation-grips-market,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9184c6563d335af66285429829f140ad07dcc003-1024x681.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42410978,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggttxk,1633555919,"Bitcoin Price Rally Fueled by Whales’ $1.6B Buy, Blockchain Data Shows","One or a group of large bitcoin buyers, also called bitcoin whales, appeared to be behind Wednesday’s price pop, based on data that showed large bitcoin purchases on exchanges during early U.S. trading hours.  But why the whale – or whales – placed bitcoin buying orders of nearly $1.6 billion in a few minutes on a centralized exchange remains unclear.  At press time, bitcoin was changing hands at $54,938.47, up 7.89% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk 20.  According to South Korea-based blockchain data firm CryptoQuant, someone or a group of people purchased the massive amount of bitcoin on the spot market on centralized exchanges between 13:11 and 13:16 UTC Wednesday.  The timing of the purchase came not long after U.S. Republicans shared favorable comments on cryptocurrencies and amid increased expectations from markets that the U.S. could soon approve a futures-based bitcoin exchange fund.  The purchase could have started on Coinbase, Ki Young Ju, co-founder and CEO of CryptoQuant told CoinDesk. He pointed out that “Coinbase premium” rose sharply around the same time before it dropped again.  The “Coinbase premium” is an indicator showing the gap between Coinbase’s BTC/U.S. dollar (USD) pair and Binance’s BTC/USDT pair involving the tether stablecoin. When the number increases, it usually reflects stronger buying power on Coinbase, the centralized exchange.  But Willy Woo, an independent blockchain data analyst, disagreed with this narrative. He told CoinDesk that the purchase mostly came from Binance, citing data from another blockchain data firm Glassnode.  According to Glassnode, the hourly charts of net transfer volume for bitcoin from and to Coinbase, or the difference in volume flowing into and out of Coinbase, has been more neutral compared with its competitor Binance, on a 48-hour moving average.  On Binance, the difference in bitcoin volume flowing into and out of the exchange has been negative since the past weekend.  I “haven’t seen any netflows coming out of [Coinbase] [and] also the buying on there is not that out of the ordinary compared to other exchanges,” Woo said. “The buying actually looked stronger on Binance ... Coinbase was net selling more than buying.”  Lucas Outumuro, head of research at Miami, Florida-based blockchain data firm IntoTheBlock, also said the purchase mainly came from Binance, citing data from his own company.  Regardless of which exchange was responsible for the large order that seemed to spur bitcoin’s spike, the bigger question is why the purchase took place on an exchange.  Large bitcoin orders are usually placed through the over-the-counter (OTC) market. In that way, the transactions won’t move prices the way they would have if the trades were occurring on the spot market via exchanges.  A large purchase on the spot market that potentially has moved the market up dramatically seems suspicious to CryptoQuant’s Ju, who suggested that whales were trying to stimulate interest among other investors by creating a price increase. These investors would then become fearful of missing out on the surge. “Sometimes, you have to manipulate the price to make FOMO (fear of missing out),” Ju said.  But Outumuro said that large buys via OTC desks can be too slow for some traders because of the current bullish sentiment on the market.  “Given that bitcoin broke out of a multi-month trendline and above a local high, I’d argue there’s a high amount of momentum trading taking place in spot markets – with high volume and conviction,” he said.  Indeed, the market’s attention is now back to bitcoin in full bullish mode: As bitcoin broke above $54,000 on Wednesday, institutional interest in bitcoin has risen significantly too.  One-month bitcoin futures contracts based on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) are trading at an annualized premium as much as 17.73% to the spot price, according to derivatives research firm Skew.  As CoinDesk reported, the increased premium on CME’s bitcoin futures contracts shows higher demand among CME traders to build long exposure in bitcoin. In the crypto market, analysts and traders consider CME synonymous with institutional investors.  “It’s rare to see BTC in the top 5% of crypto asset performers in any given 24 hours,” digital asset prime broker Genesis wrote in its newsletter on Wednesday. “Given that BTC is for many large institutions the ‘on ramp,’... this further supports the conclusion that this runup is institution-driven.” (Genesis is owned by Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk.)",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/10/06/bitcoin-price-rally-fueled-by-whales-16b-buy-blockchain-data-shows,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/488464fe6b8a87a0d56aff6ec5e0bd208ce35c0d-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42424515,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2pbPh,1633555895,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Dominance Rises as Altcoins Underperform,"Bitcoin surged toward $54,000 on Wednesday, the highest level in almost five months. The cryptocurrency is up about 8% over the past 24 hours, compared with a 3% rise in ether over the same period.  Analysts pointed to renewed bullish sentiment ahead of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) decision on a bitcoin ETF, which could occur in the coming weeks.  In the bitcoin futures market, front-month contracts based on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) were trading at an annualized premium of 12.8% to the spot price, which is the highest level since mid-April. A futures-based ETF, if approved, could bring more buying pressure for the CME futures, CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole reported.  For now, some analysts see room for continued upside for BTC as momentum improves.  “I have to say, looking at the daily chart, the rise looks healthier this time as momentum has built steadily from the $40,000 area without facing rejection before crossing $50,000, as it has done many times before,” Daniela Hathorn, an analyst at DailyFX, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  Latest Prices  Bitcoin (BTC), $54,913, +7.3%  Ether (ETH), $3,581, +2.6%  S&P 500: +0.5%  Gold: $1,765, +0.2%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.524%  Bitcoin dominance  The bitcoin dominance ratio, which measures BTC’s market capitalization relative to the total crypto market capitalization, increased to about 44%, from a low of about 40% last month. The rise in the dominance ratio reflects bitcoin’s recent outperformance versus alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) – a trend that some analysts expect will continue this quarter.  “There has been fresh spot buying activity in BTC, and looking at the price action we expect to see a fresh all-time high in the coming weeks,” Pankaj Balani, CEO of Delta Exchange, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. “We also expect BTC to outperform altcoins and the money to rotate into BTC from alts going forward.”  The bitcoin dominance ratio had declined in recent months as altcoins outperformed. During the sell-off last month, investors may have rotated out of altcoins and into bitcoin.  Ether underperforms  Ether, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is underperforming bitcoin. The ETH/BTC price ratio is attempting to break below 0.065, which provided support for ether relative to bitcoin in August. Failure to hold current support could trigger further downside toward 0.057, although oversold signals are starting to appear on the charts.  Outside of bitcoin, ether’s market capitalization continues to dominate other altcoins. The adoption of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized finance (DeFi) and other blockchain applications have helped push the narrative that ETH’s market capitalization could continue to grow, according to a report by CoinDesk Research.  Altcoin roundup  National Bank of Georgia to test central bank digital currency next year: The National Bank of Georgia, which in May said it was exploring the possible development of a central bank digital currency (CBDC), plans to launch a pilot program next year, reported CoinDesk’s Sheldon Reback. Initial testing will be aimed at retail use, Interfax first reported, citing Papuna Lezhava, a vice governor at the central bank. A digital lari is not crypto currency, but is the evolution of cash, Lezhava said. It will improve the efficiency of the Georgia’s payments system and broaden financial inclusion.  Strips Finance closes $8.5 million funding round for DeFi derivatives project: Strips Finance, a fixed-income platform, raised the funds in a token sale with participation from Fabric Ventures, Morningstar Capital, Multicoin Capital and Sequoia Capital India, CoinDesk’s Andrew Thurman reported. Strips is planning to launch in November with initial functionality that will enable interest rate swaps (IRSs) via automated market makers (AMMs), the decentralized exchanges over which much of DeFi is transacted.

42424506,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2pb7h,1633553985,Bitcoin Price Surges to 5-Month High Over $54K,"Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, surged past $54,000 to the highest in almost five months as bullishness returns to the market following the prior months’ slump.  At press time, bitcoin was trading at $54,220, up 8.7% over the last 24 hours. It was the highest price since May 12, before a crackdown by China on its domestic cryptocurrency and other negative news helped push the price below $30,000. In February, the bitcoin price had hit an all-time high close to $65,000.  The latest rally has pushed bitcoin’s market capitalization back up above $1 trillion, according to data from Messari.  “Bitcoin’s move to a five month high comes as no surprise to those who have been following this asset closely over the last few months,” said Jason Deane, analyst at Quantum Economics.  Improving sentiment  Markets often move on momentum and sentiment - especially after periods where it has been trading for a while in a price range, according to Deane. In June and July, bitcoin mostly traded in between $30,000 and $40,000, and then in August and September, the price settled into a range from $40,000 to $50,000.  Sentiment has significantly improved over the first week of October, signaling a shift away from the previous few months’ market panic. Bitcoin’s jump of more than $10,000 just since Oct. 1 works out to a gain of 25% already this month.  “If the bulls are looking for a pain point, then the next stop is $60,000, and if they don’f find a pocket of shorts to force out, then confidence will only grow,” Matt Blom, global head of sales trading at the digital-asset firm Eqonex, wrote Wednesday in a newsletter.  According to analysts for the cryptocurrency exchange Kraken, the fourth quarter has historically been bitcoin’s best, with an average return of 119% dating back to 2011. Last year, the price nearly tripled in the fourth quarter.  Denis Vinokourov, head of research at Synergia Capital, attributed the latest rally to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler’s statement to Congress on Tuesday that the SEC has no plans to ban cryptocurrencies.  “Gensler may have come across as very anti-crypto but he is not here to kill off crypto,” said Vinokourov.  “Tectonic plates have come together with the threat of a ban being removed,” said Charles Morris, founder of ByteTree Asset Management.  ‘More resilient’  Traditional markets are struggling in the current macroeconomic environment with falling stock prices, a potential energy crisis and fears over losses in the Chinese property sector, according to Morris.  “Global markets are derisking,” partly due to fears over a possible financial crisis triggered by debt repayment woes at the Chinese real estate developer Evergrande, the Kraken analysts wrote in a monthly report.  That might mean that “bitcoin is arguably becoming more resilient against traditional market turbulence,” according to the report.

The firm outlined Tuesday what it sees as key issues in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, including consumer protections, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), regulatory fragmentation and overlap as well as tax reporting, and clarity regarding certain blockchain ecosystems.  “Each of our four proposals is designed to stand on its own, but taken together, they represent the start to a comprehensive approach to supervision, oversight and taxation in a decentralized environment,” the firm said.  Specifically, a16z’s consumer protections proposal, filed in response to a call from U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) of the Senate Banking Committee, recommended creating a simple disclosure-based supervision regime under the Consumer Financial Protection Act. DAOs, meanwhile, are to be given similar legal rights to those of a standard incorporated entity, including tax requirements and being allowed to open bank accounts and sign legal agreements.  The firm suggested three ways to shore up regulatory fragmentation and overlap. Those included harmonizing areas of jurisdiction among agencies, establishing an industry self-regulatory organization and setting up a nonprofit for technical oversight. In its fourth proposal, a16z reiterated the comments it made in August about the U.S. infrastructure bill that is pending in Congress.  “The United States tax and regulatory environments are designed for centralized operations. Yet, as currently drafted, the infrastructure bill pending in Congress would impose tax reporting requirements on a wide array of actors who would have no ability to comply,” the firm said.  In August, Toomey, the Senate Banking Committee’s ranking member, issued a request for feedback in a bid to solicit ideas and legislative proposals on the best regulatory approaches to crypto and blockchain.

So this is just transformational in terms of being able to exchange crypto for fiat and fiat for crypto,” Denelle Dixon, CEO and executive director of the Stellar Development Foundation, said in an interview. “We’re trying to go as big as we can.”  The news will come as a slap in the face for Ripple, the cryptocurrency payments network whose longstanding relationship with MoneyGram wound down after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed suit against Ripple in December 2020, saying the firm violated federal securities laws.  Alex Holmes, MoneyGram’s chairman and CEO, pointed out the partnership with Stellar is an entirely different animal from the relationship MoneyGram had with Ripple, which leveraged the crypto firm’s on-demand liquidity (ODL) to facilitate foreign exchange (FX) trading.  According to Holmes, working with Stellar is larger in scope because it directly touches on consumer payments.  Leaving aside the question of whether Ripple’s native currency XRP is a security or not in the eyes of the law, the vision the firms were working on had certain limitations.  “The process worked,” said Holmes in an interview. “The challenge was we were trying to create an FX market in a different world. It really needed a lot more time to bring that to life and make it work. The other challenge was that because we were trading XRP, that, unfortunately, has volatility associated with it.”  Read more: Stellar to Add Support for USDC Stablecoin, Opening Up Dollar-Backed Remittances  Banks have typically been skittish about getting hands-on with cryptocurrencies. United Texas Bank, which will serve as a settlement bank between Circle and MoneyGram, benefits from having a progressive approach, as does Texas as a state, said Holmes.  “Texas has a fairly proactive stance on crypto and the governor has made a few comments,” Holmes said. “United Texas bank is an established bank here and very focused on the opportunities in the crypto space. Not every bank is willing to step into the crypto world, and I think it says a lot about how progressive that bank is trying to be.”  In what’s becoming an increasingly febrile regulatory climate, CoinDesk reported this week that Circle received a subpoena from the SEC. So did this feel like deja vu all over again for MoneyGram?  “I’m quite used to regulation,” Holmes said, “and unfortunately, a lot of regulation ends up being a look back. I think the blockchain world and digital asset world [have] really accelerated and now I see a lot of regulators looking to catch up.”",POSITIVE,USDC,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | USDC,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/10/06/moneygram-partners-with-stellar-and-usdc-for-blockchain-based-payments,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/779fa847dfa0e81ae3f5f0cb8cae4125d96accc2-594x446.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The disclosure came as the Ethereum community prepares for a switch from a proof-of-work consensus to proof-of-stake – the largest and most technically complex conversion of its kind in blockchain history with over $20 billion in staked ETH on the line.  StakeWise’s staff flagged the disclosure on Twitter, noting that the white hat who reported the vulnerability was Dmitri Tsumak, one of the protocol’s co-founders.  The timing is fortuitous, because Rocket Pool was set to launch its mainnet within 24 hours. The project has postponed the launch until the fix is in place.  Tsumak told CoinDesk that he has agreed with Immunefi, Lido and Rocket Pool to refrain from disclosing the exact nature of the bug while the affected platforms work on a patch, but both Lido and Rocket Pool are planning to disburse the maximum allowable Immunefi bounty of $100,000 – indicating a bug of “critical severity,” according to StakeWise co-founder Kirill Kutakov.  Tsumak initially contacted Rocket Pool about the vulnerability, and when it became clear other protocols could have the same bug, he opted to contact the bounty platform Immunefi as well as Lido.  “As soon as I reported to Rocket Pool, we chatted about who else could be affected, and in Lido’s case, they were seeing the same issue in a bit different interpretation,” Tsumak said.  A tweet thread from Lido mentioned that “under 100″ ETH was vulnerable on Tuesday, but a vulnerability disclosure published today said that upward of 20,000 ETH worth $72 million was at risk.  In both cases, the bug allowed validators or node operators to drain depositor funds – a flaw with how validators are registered with ETH 2.0.  Lido did not respond to a request for comment by press time.  “Rocket Pool is glad that its bug bounty program lead to the discovery of a serious exploit that affected multiple staking providers. Inline with responsible disclosure we worked with our bug bounty program (Immunefi) to alert the other teams quickly. We have extended our warmest thanks to Dmitri for reporting the exploit,” said Rocket Pool manager Darren Langley in a statement to CoinDesk.  Additionally, the Rocket Pool community is planning a non-fungible token (NFT) drop for the StakeWise community to commemorate the event, according to conversations on the Discord messaging app.  Kutakov said that the decision to notify the platform’s rivals was an easy one.  “We wouldn’t wish this vulnerability on our competitors, and that’s why we went with the amicable route and let them know about it before their launch,” he said.  Security review  StakeWise was able to identify the bug because it was working on decentralizing its own platform’s v2, which will include a multi-validator architecture. StakeWise allows for interest-bearing ETH deposits but uses a single-node system.  The project believes that it has has been “flying under the radar” for some time because of that centralization. Rocket Pool’s RPL token now sits at a $353.5 million market capitalization, and Lido’s LDO is at $103 million. StakeWise’s SWISE, meanwhile, has a $4 million market cap.  This bug report is just another instance of Tsumak’s open-source ethos, Kutakov said.  “Dmitri has been known in the StakeWise community for putting out things that advance the space,” Kutakov said of his colleague.  He pointed toward Tsumak’s Horcrux, an open-source tool that allows projects to decentralize a withdrawal key.  While StakeWise acknowledged that the bug report is something of a marketing coup, its end goal is to ensure a healthy launch for ETH 2.0.  “It is great to generate awareness, but we see this space as a collaborative effort with everyone working to make Ethereum’s proof-of-stake a reality,” Kutakov said.  StakeWise v2 is now under audit, with a target launch date in November.

In some cases, the universities with the best reputations – as measured by long-running generalized rankings – have the best blockchain offerings. But, in many cases, the two datasets don’t match. Several schools in our ranking “overperform” on blockchain and several “underperform” compared to their general scores.  Chart by Shuai Hao / CoinDesk  In the initial stages of the investigation, CoinDesk collected academic reputation data from USNWR Best Global Universities (2021), the QS World University Rankings (2022), the ShanghaiRanking’s Academic Ranking of World Universities (2021) or the World University Rankings (2022). This data was used to calculate an external aggregate rank for each university in the sample.  At the close of the investigation, we compared a university’s blockchain rank, as determined by CoinDesk, against its aggregate rank from outside institutions. In some cases, a university’s blockchain rank was closely aligned with their external rank. However, in other cases there was larger amounts of variation.

42424514,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2pbNh,1633550757,"Huobi a Loser in China Crackdown, Bitcoin Futures Market Suggests","Call it the Huobi discount.  Bitcoin’s move to $50,000 has revived bullish sentiment, lifting futures premiums on most major cryptocurrency exchanges. These premiums represent the difference between the price of bitcoin futures contracts traded on a given exchange and the broader spot-market price – often seen as a gauge of speculative interest.  But on the Huobi exchange, historically skewed toward Chinese customers, the premium hasn’t budged. Analysts say the relatively low premium on Huobi might be the result of the exchange’s decision to suspend services to China-based clients.  While the annualized three-month futures premium, or basis, has recently averaged around 5% on Huobi, the premium on Binance, OKEx, Deribit and other major exchanges has climbed to near 10%.  “Traders have been actively moving to other exchanges to trade perps and futures,” said Matthew Dibb, chief operating officer at Stack Funds. “Perps” refers to perpetual swaps, a type of derivative in cryptocurrency markets that serves as an alternative to typical futures contracts.  Huobi announced late last week that Oct. 29 will be the last day for derivative trading for users on the Chinese mainland. The exchange cited a “commitment to local compliance policies” and said it would “retire user accounts over the next few months.”  “Huobi’s trading volume amongst leveraged products has shown signs of weakening given the regulatory overhang from China,” Dibb said. “This is having a large impact on futures volume and basis.”  Patrick Heusser, head of trading at Crypto Finance AG, said that some traders on Huobi need to close their positions.  “This might be due to offboarding pressure by Huobi,” he said.  Arcane Research, a Norwegian cryptocurrency-analysis firm, wrote Tuesday in a weekly report that the Huobi futures contract had previously been one of the most important for bitcoin’s price discovery. “So these developments will present some interesting structural changes in the market onwards,” according to the report.  Huobi has lost significant market share to competitors Binance and OKEx since the start of the year. Huobi’s share of spot-market trading volumes has dropped to 16% from 24%, according to data from Kaiko.  The exchange’s phasing out of Chinese accounts over the coming months could impact its share of volume even more, Kaiko wrote in an Oct. 4 research newsletter.

42424508,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2pbBh,1633550232,SEC Chair Gensler: A Ban on Crypto Would Be ‘Up to Congress’,"U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler told Congress on Tuesday that the SEC has no plans to ban crypto.  When asked by Rep. Ted Budd (R-N.C.), a longtime crypto supporter and member of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus, if the SEC had any plans to follow China’s lead in banning cryptocurrency in favor of a prospective central bank digital currency (CBDC), Gensler said, “No, that would be up to Congress.”  Gensler’s assertion that the SEC does not plan to ban crypto mirrors similar remarks made by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell last week, when the central bank head told the House Financial Services Committee that the Fed had “no plans to ban” the $2.2 trillion asset class.  Questions from Congress about the SEC’s efforts to regulate crypto come amid a growing debate on Capitol Hill about how the industry and its various parts, including exchanges and stablecoins, should be regulated.  During Tuesday’s four-hour hearing, Gensler fielded questions about cryptocurrency, stablecoins, the regulation of exchanges and decentralized finance (DeFi).  Gensler mostly reiterated his previous thoughts on crypto regulation including the need for exchanges to “come in and register” with the SEC, the potential systemic risk posed by stablecoins and the need for them to be subject to increased regulation, and that “most” cryptocurrencies fall under the definition of a security.  However, Gensler also expanded on his understanding of the SEC’s authority to regulate the crypto industry.  When asked by Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.) to provide “guidance” on the topic of crypto regulation, Gensler reiterated his previous position that crypto exchanges need to register with the SEC but added that decentralized exchanges (DEXs) would also be subject to regulations.  “Even in decentralized platforms – so-called DeFi platforms – there is a centralized protocol. And though they don’t take custody in the same way [as centralized exchanges], I think those are the places that we can get the maximum amount of public policy.”  Gensler also expanded on his stance on stablecoins, which he has previously called the “poker chips” at the crypto “casino.” Gensler doubled down on his poker chip analogy during his response to several questions, adding that he viewed stablecoins as a systemic risk to the economy.  “The $125 billion of stablecoins we have right now are like poker chips at a casino,” Genser said. “I do think that if this continues to grow – and it’s grown about tenfold in the last year – it can present those systemic wide risks.”  The statement comes a day after CoinDesk first reported that USDC stablecoin issuer Circle was served with an “investigative subpoena” from the SEC’s Enforcement Division in July.  The price of bitcoin, already up on the day, appeared to jump further on Gensler’s comments, rising to as high as $51,678.20. In recent trading, the price of the leading cryptocurrency was at $51,329.82, up 4.59% in the last 24 hours.

42424497,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2parh,1633545775,"Art Blocks Raises $6M From True Ventures, Galaxy on Strength of Generative NFTs","Art Blocks, the computer-generated digital art market where chromatic squiggles have commanded millions of dollars, raised $6 million in an equity round.  True Ventures pitched in 50% of the round with major participation from Galaxy Interactive, Galaxy Digital’s entertainment-focused venture fund, and Collab Currency. Existing investors Libertus Capital and the crypto investment communities Flamingo DAO and The LAO also re-upped, Art Blocks founder Erick Calderon said on CoinDesk’s “Opinionated” podcast.  The round closed in August, before Art Blocks exploded into the non-fungible token (NFT) mainstream as a hub for so-called “generative” art created by algorithms and code.  Its geometric, sometimes psychedelic computer creations have generated over a billion dollars in trading volume atop the platform, according to data compiled by Nonfungible.com.  “It’s been a great ride,” Calderon said on the Oct. 6 episode of “Opinionated.” A “blockchain nerd” and entrepreneur who runs an artisanal tile import business in Houston by day, he said his 11-month-old hobby has completely taken off.  His own stock has risen just as fast. “Snowfo,” as he’s known, is now one of the minor celebrities of the NFT space. It’s a role Calderon said he was still coming to terms with.  “I’m literally just afraid of saying something that will trigger people into buying something or selling something,” he said. “People are very well aware of the influence that they carry in this space, and I think some people wield it very, very, very well and some people wield it I think in a scary way.”  Art Blocks on the rise  For Art Blocks, however, the focus is on growth. Calderon said in an earlier interview that the cash will fund an expansion of the engineering team. He’s targeting 10 full-time engineers by the end of the year, and perhaps double that by mid-2022.  It’s a major turnabout for a website that scraped by for its first 10 months atop a backend built on novice code, Calderon said. For half a year it was him, one full-time coder and one part-time engineer keeping the NFT platform afloat.  Art Blocks began courting the “established” artists even before it fully launched. Jeff Davis, a digital artist whose geometric pieces have been exhibited in museums, joined early and is now chief creative officer. His presence helped prompt a rush of “hundreds” of artist-applicants hoping to list their works on Art Blocks.  How it works  Their work is united through ones and zeros – and not much else. Generative artists write code in lieu of canvas and paint. When a computer reads their programs, it spits out the resulting work. The iterations are endless.  “With generative art, or algorithmic art, you might spend 40 hours building an algorithm that is shaped and tweaked and finessed into producing seemingly unlimited outputs,” Calderon said.  What makes a specific, generative project brilliant – or really the ones that stand out – are when you press the spacebar, and the entire output changes. And it’s compellingly different and still beautiful, and you still know that it belongs to that same algorithm.  Generative art as a practice predates NFTs by decades, Calderon said; Ethereum is hardly a necessity when it comes to computerized masterpieces. But the blockchain allows for digital ownership to thrive online.  He isn’t focused on these metaverse creations breaking through to the meatspace. An installation in the Guggenheim would be nice, he admits, and he thinks modern art museums will come around. But an Art Blocks exhibition isn’t the benchmark for success.  Instead, he’s focused on building up the generative art scene.  “We just want recognition that this is an art form, like, a legitimate art form, because it’s something that people have been pouring their lives into for years, and it’s just never really been a widely recognized form of art.”  Listen to “Opinionated” for the full story:  Correction (Oct. 6, 19:29 UTC): True Ventures led the round, not Galaxy Interactive.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/10/06/art-blocks-raises-6m-from-galaxy-flamingo-dao-on-strength-of-generative-nfts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/759549679a41752da52b1eebf95207f5c1e4ceb6-800x600.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42424656,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHVg1h,1633542074,Universities Are Flunking Blockchain Tech,"As higher education shifted online through the global pandemic, issues of trust, identity and fraud crippled learning and research. Blockchain technology has emerged as a potential solution to these long-standing problems and might even offer opportunities for novel and emerging use cases. However, despite being an important driver for the blockchain industry, universities have failed to realize the potential of blockchain technology for their own use.  This post is part of CoinDesk’s 2021 universities package. Quinn DuPont is an assistant professor of business at University College Dublin. He is the author of Cryptocurrencies and Blockchains (Polity, 2019).  To better understand how blockchain and innovative EdTech companies might disrupt this trillion dollar industry, through 2021, I led a team of students who surveyed the market, looked at potential use cases and separated reality from hyperbole. In our comprehensive report, we discuss many compelling use cases but found few serious players. With the exception of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), top tier universities remain conservative, neither embracing the educational and research opportunities brought about by blockchain nor utilizing the technology to better serve their student, faculty and social stakeholders.  Current challenges  Higher education is complex with well-established incumbents and important norms and traditions. While these norms and traditions are certainly barriers to innovation, companies hoping to disrupt the industry will fail if they do not pay heed to this reality. In our report, we identified four areas for potential innovation to solve real challenges: research and innovation, certification and validation, student identity, and integrated and online learning environments. While each has its complexities (which we discuss in our report), we believe blockchain technology is now mature enough to offer real solutions.  Read More: The Top Universities for Blockchain by CoinDesk 2021  Perhaps the most vexing challenge facing universities is dataset provenance. Datasets are often produced by university researchers and shared with commercial and government stakeholders. These datasets may contain the results of empirical research or training data for machine learning models. Due to the importance of these datasets, it is critical that their users know where they came from and whether they have been tampered with.  A robust software supply chain tracks datasets across their lifecycle, from creation to use, to modification and end of life. Like traditional supply chains (a use case already disrupted by blockchain technology), software supply chains need assurances of confidentiality, integrity and availability. Moreover, since some datasets contain sensitive information, access needs to be carefully managed. For example, a recent Microsoft report detailed the volume and severity of attacks to machine-learning (ML) datasets. The authors reported that “model poisoning is the top perceived threat against ML for business decision makers.” Since blockchains excel at tracking digital assets without the need for a trusted third party, they are obvious solutions for critical software infrastructures. We believe universities play a critical role in ensuring datasets are kept secure.  Read more: Do You Need to Go to College to Get a Job in Crypto? | David Z. Morris  The next most important challenge brought about by the global pandemic and now facing higher education is diploma fraud (although student identity, as the lynchpin to widespread online cheating, is a close third). When university campuses shut their gates during the pandemic, many of the traditional paper-based processes were exposed as inefficient and insecure. Diplomas and transcripts are still today issued as paper copies, and when pressed to offer digital copies universities issue insecure versions that are easily fabricated or tampered with. By securely recording unique “fingerprints” (cryptographic hashes) of digital assets and solving the challenges of managing a decentralized public key infrastructure, blockchain technologies offer a simple, turnkey solution for issuing and managing university transcripts and diplomas, while potentially lowering administration costs.  Disruptive developments  Going beyond the current state of the art, we recommend four disruptive potential use cases for blockchain in higher education: decentralized education marketplaces, educational incentivization, smart-contract test marking and reputation management. The most enticing of these opportunities is decentralized educational marketplaces. Due to the low-friction, low trust environment made possible by blockchain, federated or multi-institutional degrees might become possible, allowing students to choose best-of educational offerings (bottom-up) rather than prescribed (top-down) curricula. A decentralized educational marketplace might also enable “subscription” models for lifelong learning.  A green field  Despite these turnkey opportunities and future developments, the commercial landscape of blockchain in EdTech is a green field. We found very few serious blockchain providers in the industry and seemingly little interest from would-be buyers – that is, the higher education providers subject to disruption.  In our analyses, we found that universities have numerous ways to lock out competitors and have been effective at doing so. Market disruptors like massive online open courses (MOOCs) have come and gone, while low-cost and online universities have existed for decades. But none of those options have supplanted the perceived value of a top-flight, brick-and-mortar education. These are formidable challenges for the nascent blockchain EdTech space, but we see many opportunities for blockchain including greater access to investors, novel education and research practices and emerging uses like citizen science and other peer-to-peer models for education.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Quinn DuPont,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/10/06/universities-are-flunking-blockchain-tech,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/565aa07d41488242364da9c01c5b82c33258aab2-2048x1155.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

For as long as marketing companies have been aggregating data, a smaller group of consumers has been pushing back, and a determined set of entrepreneurs has been trying to build businesses that allow consumers to directly control and monetize their personal information. While I believe that the tools and the law are increasingly on the side of consumers who want to protect their privacy and are diligent about it, I believe there’s little chance that a new wave of blockchain-businesses will genuinely enable individual monetization.  Recently, a number of blockchain-based companies have sprung up with the vision of helping people take control of their data. They get an enthusiastic reception at conferences and from venture capitalists. As someone who cares deeply about my privacy, I wish I thought they stood a better chance of success, but they face many obstacles on the road ahead.  Perhaps the biggest obstacle I see for personal-data monetization businesses is that your personal information just isn’t worth that much on its own. Data aggregation businesses run on a principle that’s sometimes referred to as the “river of pennies.” Each individual user or asset has nearly zero value, but multiply the number of users by millions and suddenly you have something that looks valuable. That doesn’t work in the reverse, however. Companies are far more focused and disciplined in the pursuit of millions of dollars in ad or data revenue than one consumer trying to make $25 a year.  But why isn’t your data worth that much? Very simply, the world is awash in your information, and you’re not the only source of that information. The truth is that you leak information constantly in a digital ecosystem. It’s not just that the phone company knows where you are, so do social networks and your payment and airline apps. Even your takeout provider knows who you are. I counted more than 50 apps on my smartphone alone that track location. You can go and remove their location privileges, but chances are that you haven’t and you won’t.  Just think about it: Fifty companies are trying to aggregate and sell my location data. In a competitive market with an infinite supply of my location information and multiple sellers, the market-clearing price is effectively zero. The people who really make money are those who can aggregate millions of users, not because their location information is valuable, but because the aggregation is valuable.  The focus that millions in profits brings to data aggregators causes them to deploy a wide range of tools, many of which fall into the category of “dark patterns”: stealthy tricks that make doing the right thing difficult. Last week, I stayed at a hotel that required me to authenticate for Wi-Fi daily. Every day, I had to uncheck the default box that subscribed me to their marketing emails. It was infuriating. Avoiding this data collection is hard work. It’s mentally taxing.  Finally, it’s important to remember that your personal information does have value in the marketplace. It’s the original form of a micropayment. It’s buying your weather forecast, news summary and spoken turn-by-turn directions. Without these micropayments, we would need to actually pay for these services on an individual basis – and while the cost of getting a weather forecast might be less than a penny, the cost of managing that transaction is high, especially if you have to do so as a conscious choice.  All which brings me to a painful conclusion: The ship has sailed on data privacy and monetization. While there is real demand for more privacy and some consumers are likely to pay for that as a differentiator with some products, I fear it is likely to remain a luxury experience. Nor are fears of this path new: John Hegel sounded the alarm on the battle for personal information in a prescient article in 1997. However, between the low value of our own data and the path-dependency we have been on for more than 20 years, it’s hard to see how this will change anytime soon.  Although I’m pessimistic about the chances for a revolution in personal privacy for legacy ecosystems like social media, I am positive about two areas where we can make a difference. The first is properly anonymizing data sets. Encryption and the mathematics of privacy could make the privacy of a single individual much more impenetrable. That could restore a level of privacy without preventing the aggregation of data. It’s one thing to be presented with appropriate advertising, it’s another thing to be individually targeted. The difference is small but significant.  In blockchain and decentralized finance (DeFi), we have a decentralized industry based on building business around user stakes and ownership, not advertising-driven metrics like engagement. In this ecosystem, a zero-knowledge proof showing you have verified identity without breaking privacy has a good chance of taking hold. Compliance, security and privacy. All in one. That’s a future worth working toward.

42424501,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2pavh,1633525882,"Ukraine’s President Rejects Crypto Bill, Demands Changes","Ukraine’s yearlong marathon to legalize cryptocurrencies has taken a detour. Instead of signing the country’s first bill regulating digital assets into law, President Volodymyr Zelensky returned it to the parliament for changes.  According to an announcement on the president’s website, Zelensky wants the bill changed so that the National Commission on Securities and Stock Market, Ukraine’s equivalent to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, becomes the main crypto regulator. The current version has the Ministry of Digital Transformation regulating cryptocurrencies, the National Commission on Securities and Stock Market regulating digital assets backed by securities and the National Bank of Ukraine in charge of central bank digital currency (CBDC) issuance.  The version proposed by the president leaves CBDC supervision to the National Bank, but everything else goes to the securities regulator, including the licensing of the crypto brokers and other services.  “In particular, the public reports of the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) state that certain types of virtual assets contain, in their economic essence, features characteristic of financial instruments. Regulation of issuance of such types of virtual assets should be carried out by financial market regulators, as this function is specific to them,” said the president’s message to parliament, which was published on the legislature’s website.  Parliament will now have to give the bill another hearing and suggest a new version.  The bill, introduced to the parliament last summer, was created with input from the local crypto community. The document passed a second hearing in September and was sent to Zelensky for signing into law.  Ukraine is home to multiple well-known blockchain developers and startups. However, the country is struggling with its status as a risky jurisdiction on the global market. The bill, sponsored by Ukraine’s Ministry of Digital Transformation, is aimed at developing the digital assets market and attracting crypto businesses to the country.  Read more: From Risky to Promising: Ukraine’s Quest to Become a Dream Crypto Jurisdiction  Cutting out Russia  The law defines digital assets as non-material goods that have a value and are represented by “a set of data in electronic form.” Digital assets are divided in two groups: those that are backed by other assets and those are not. Digital assets can not be used to pay directly for goods and services in Ukraine.  Digital assets also include the CBDC, which the central bank can issue, according to the recently adopted On Payment Services law.  The new bill defines legal ownership of a digital asset as control over its keys, unless they were stolen or held by a custodian, either due to an agreement with the owner or a court decision. The document also details basic rules of operation for businesses working with digital assets in Ukraine.  As the bill moved through the legislative process in the Verkhovna Rada, the initial text was updated to say that no crypto company having beneficiaries or executives in the “aggressor state,” can do business in Ukraine.  By the “aggressor state” the authors mean Russia, the Ministry of Digital Transformation confirmed to CoinDesk. The country’s neighbor to the east made its presence felt seven years ago, annexing the Crimea peninsula and fueling simmering civil unrest in the eastern part of Ukraine with weaponry and unidentified troops.

42376034,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwE15t,1633523547,Securities Meet NFTs With Investment Platform Republic’s New Music Vertical,"Republic – the financial services company, not the record label – has announced the launch of “Republic Music,” a loosely defined investment product that claims to offer “an entirely new way to create, produce and share royalties from music.”  The result of a partnership with a crypto company called Opulous, Republic Music gives listeners the chance to “invest in the music they love for as little as $100 and share in the rights to royalties.”  The idea revolves around something called “S-NFTs,” or “Security NFTs.”  New path for NFTs?  NFTs are non-fungible tokens – a kind of cryptocurrency that can be attached to media files and treated as proof of ownership. Crypto companies usually argue that NFTs are not securities, since securities in the U.S. need to be regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  Republic seems to be taking the opposite tack, leaning into the idea that these S-NFTs are a kind of security – something you can invest in with the expectation of profit down the line.  “The songs are going to be placed in an LLC, and you will be a member of the LLC,” said Pialy Aditya, Republic’s chief strategy officer, in an interview. “You will have a share of ownership in that song, and a right to the royalty on the back end.”  That means S-NFTs are overseen by the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the finance industry’s self-regulatory body; investors based in the U.S. will need to comply with relevant KYC / AML (know your customer / anti-money laundering) regulations before they can get a piece of the action.  Read more: 3LAU Raises $16M to Tokenize Music Royalties for Artists and Fans  It hinges on what’s known as “Reg CF,” or “Regulation Crowdfunding,” which lets private companies raise up to $5 million from non-accredited investors in Kickstarter-like campaigns.  Republic also says it’s brought on rapper and one-time Donald Trump affiliate Lil Pump to sweeten the deal.  “As part of the first wave of planned releases, Lil Pump is offering fans and investors the opportunity to be part of his forthcoming single ‘Mona Lisa (feat. Soulja Boy)’, produced by Jimmy Duval,” a press release said.  Latest experiment  Companies have long tried to put digital music “on the blockchain” in a way that makes sense to consumers; a crypto streaming service called Audius is probably the biggest name in the space, but smaller projects like Catalog, Songcamp and Nina have also generated buzz.  More recently, crypto-conscious DJ 3LAU rolled out a similar royalties play called Royal, which bypasses the securities angle entirely.  Republic considers its music platform a “vertical” of its primary investment business; it’s planning several other verticals geared toward fractional investments in different aspects of the creator economy.  “I think in the New World Order, early supporters are going to be rewarded, the artists are going to get paid and the community is going to grow stronger,” Republic’s Aditya said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | SPONSORED,Will Gottsegen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/10/06/securities-meet-nfts-with-investment-platform-republics-new-music-vertical,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8e831dcb1c5c4a3eb5cbd98483023dfa28ba85d2-1600x1200.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42376045,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwE1HD,1633519800,How Will the Ethereum Ecosystem React to Fee Burning?,"This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum 2.0 and its sweeping impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to Valid Points here.  October marks the beginning of the fourth quarter and perhaps an end to the crypto market’s fifth annual September Dump.  More importantly, we are excited to announce the release of CoinDesk Research’s Q3 Quarterly Review, containing data-driven analysis on Bitcoin, Ethereum, DeFi and NFTs.  While digging through the aftermath of EIP 1559, I realized that the upgrade was more multifaceted than I once understood. CoinDesk columnist Nic Carter had pointed out that EIP 1559′s design changes are “inherently political’ and that they pit blockscape consumers, token holders and miners against each other. While this could be true on a case-by-case basis, I don’t believe it captures the overall sentiment of any class of Ethereum stakeholders.  Why? The changes to the fee market and the addition of a burn mechanism have wider effects on all aspects of the user experience than what appears just on the surface. Furthermore, it is likely too early for any single participant to know how the upgrade will affect them in the long run. For example, CoinMetric’s data shows us that while miners may have lost out on a majority of transaction fees, profitability in USD has remained roughly the same.  Can the newfound scarcity narrative have a long-term positive impact on the price of ether? Should miners be upset if they generate similar revenue through block rewards alone? Again, I believe it is too early to assert any final takeaways from the upgrade, which I am most likely guilty of doing myself.  If you are interested in further analysis around EIP 1559, MEV, DeFi and more (like Bitcoin), take a look through our Quarterly Review.  Pulse check  The following is an overview of network activity on the Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain over the past week. For more information about the metrics featured in this section, check out our 101 explainer on Eth 2.0 metrics.  Disclaimer: All profits made from CoinDesk’s Eth 2.0 staking venture will be donated to a charity of the company’s choosing once transfers are enabled on the network.  Validated takes  Compound’s founder, Robert Leshner, calls into question the ethos of decentralized finance (DeFi) after an $80 million dollar bug. BACKGROUND: A bug in Compound’s smart contracts allowed certain users to claim massive COMP rewards. Leshner briefly threatened to turn the receiving addresses over to the IRS, only to revoke the statement after strong backlash from the community. The incidental bug provoked questions on how the DeFi industry should be governed, if not by law.  AXS peaked at $155 after Axie Infinity’s revenues fell 40% in September. BACKGROUND: Arguably the most popular play-to-earn game, Axie Infinity announced an airdrop to long-time players, launching their governance token to new highs. AXS has an over $8 billion market capitalization, and the protocol earned $721 million during the third quarter, showing the potential for NFT-based gaming models.  Polygon flipped Ethereum in active user addresses after growing from 200,000 to nearly 600,000 during September. BACKGROUND: Users have scrambled for scalability throughout the last year as transaction fees on Ethereum’s layer 1 remain costly. Polygon has attracted over $4 billion in Total Value Locked (TVL) alongside a slew of new users shortly after announcing its merger with Hermez.  DeFi and NFTs collide as NFTfi looks to help collateralize art, collectables and more. BACKGROUND: NFTs and tokenization have helped create a liquid market for art that was once not very tradable (or valuable). Collateralized NFTs could allow for users to leverage against their NFT holdings, in what could be described as a digital pawn shop. NFT collateralization is a precursor to the tokenization of real world assets, highlighting the capital efficiency tokenizing could bring to other non-liquid markets.  The Altair Beacon Chain upgrade is set to activate on Oct. 27. BACKGROUND: The upgrade presents a low-stakes opportunity for Beacon Chain developers and client teams to prepare for the coming Merge. Altair will give the Beacon Chain “light client support, minor patches to incentives, per-validator inactivity leak accounting, an increase in slashing severity and cleanups to validator rewards accounting for simplified state management.”  Factoid of the week  Open comms  Valid Points incorporates information and data about CoinDesk’s own Eth 2.0 validator in weekly analysis.

With the latest deal, fans, collectors and fantasy soccer players will be able to play and trade with NFTs from the Bundesliga (first division) and Bundesliga 2 (second division).  After announcing a partnership with Spain’s La Liga on Sept. 9 to make NFTs of all its players, Sorare now has deals with two of the world’s “Big Five” soccer leagues, which Sorare estimates have more than 3.5 billion fans worldwide. Sorare already has NFT partnerships with many of the world’s top soccer teams.  The Bundesliga, Germany’s top soccer league, generated $4.5 billion in revenue during its 2020-21 season, more than Major League Baseball over the same period.  Last month, Paris-based Sorare raised $680 million in a Series B funding round at a $4.3 billion valuation. That occurred on the same week that rival NFT developer Dapper Labs, which has a separate contract with La Liga to create NFT collectibles, completed a $250 million funding round at a $7.6 billion valuation.  Sorare said in a press release that the partnership with La Liga will bring video content to its platform for the first time in the form of “NFT Moments.” The Moments are reminiscent of Dapper Labs’ popular NBA Top Shot product, which is centered around collectible basketball highlight videos.  “The Bundesliga is one of the best leagues in the world, home to some of the most exciting clubs and footballers on Earth,” Sorare CEO Nicolas Julia said in a press release. “We are very proud to partner with them to launch our first NFT Moments.”",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | SPONSORED,Eli Tan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/10/06/sorare-signs-second-major-soccer-nft-partnership-with-bundesliga,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/266914bd09f9c0df546a0b34292aa0efcf608fe9-1024x693.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

AstroSwap achieves that goal by exerting its first-mover prowess for a launchpad/DEX partnership. Through this effort, projects and developers can access a seamless route from development to trading on Cardano. The Rise Of Cardano and ADAPad These past few months have been rather interesting for the Cardano ecosystem. The introduction of staking and smart contracts has given the ecosystem an injection of fresh enthusiasm and desire to build new applications, products, and services. Moreover, it has allowed Cardano to become the third-biggest cryptocurrency by market cap, surpassing more &apos;traditional&apos; entrants like XRP, Binance Coin, and Tether&apos;s USDT. Such spectacular growth needs to be sustained by any means necessary. The recent addition of ADAPad as the dedicated launchpad for all Cardano-based projects seeking funding and incubational support is a crucial first step. Another significant milestone has been achieved as ADAPad will partner AstroSwap in the first launchpad/DEX partnership for the ecosystem. The potential for such a partnership is off the charts. One can only acquire the first-mover advantage once, and AstroSwap is ready to go the extra mile for it. Moreover, The AstroSwap team will organize its IDO on ADAPad come October 7.

A new report published Wednesday by the BIS Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) includes preliminary guidance on how to apply the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMI) to stablecoin arrangements.  The CPMI and IOSCO have invited the public to make general comments and answer a set of questions laid out in the document on the clarity of the report. Responses can be emailed to the CPMI (cpmi@bis.org) and IOSCO (consultation-03-2021@iosco.org) Secretariats by Dec. 1.  Financial regulatory agencies around the world are showing increasing interest in regulating stablecoins. The U.S. is working toward creating a federal-level framework for stablecoin issuers. China’s central bank is concerned private stablecoins can throw financial systems out of balance. Last month, the head of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, said stablecoins are not currencies but assets, and should be regulated accordingly.  The published guidance does not aim to create additional standards on stablecoin arrangements which, according to the European Central Bank, are payment systems “insofar as they permit the transfer of value between stablecoin holders.” The guidance applies to systemically important stablecoin arrangements and the regulators who follow BIS recommendations, the report said. Systemically important financial institutions are those whose failure can set off a financial crisis.  The report offers guidance on these types of stablecoin arrangements under four key principles: governance, risk management, settlement finality (the certainty that a transaction has been completed without risk of reversal) and money settlements.  “A stablecoin used by a systemically important [stablecoin arrangement] for money settlements should have little or no credit or liquidity risk,” the report says under the money settlement guidelines.  The report goes on to say that when stablecoin arrangements go about assessing the risk of a stablecoin, it should be noted if the stablecoin provides its holders with a direct legal claim on the issuer as well as “the title to or interest in the underlying reserve assets for timely convertibility at par into other liquid assets.”  A BIS press statement said that each jurisdiction can decide whether to permit stablecoin activity. If it does allow it, and if the arrangement is or has the potential to be systemic, then the PFMI would apply as instructed in the issued guidance, the statement said.  Noting that features and functions of stablecoin arrangements could evolve, some issues in the report could require further clarification and study in the coming years, according to the BIS statement.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/10/06/bis-outlines-how-stablecoins-could-comply-with-international-money-standards,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/104ff183e04981e5da1d6024fcc947c2b86395e7-1500x994.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Binance (APAC) Holdings, Binance (Services) Holdings and Binance Technologies were all formally established in the country on Sept. 27, according to a report by Ireland’s Independent news outlet on Wednesday,  The move follows mounting pressure from regulators against the Binance brand, including in countries such as Australia, the U.S. and the U.K.  On Sept. 10 and Sept. 13, Binance’s CEO, Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, signed registration documents for the three firms, according to the report.  Company documents list the Binance firms’ place of business as an accounting firm’s office above a sports shop in a building in Dublin, according to the report.  The firms were established on Binance’s behalf by Irish law firm Mason Hayes & Curran.  Last year, Binance (Ireland) Holdings was established under Zhao’s residential address in Malta. Malta’s financial regulator previously said the exchange didn’t fall under its purview, even though the company registered there in 2018.  On Sept. 24, the People’s Bank of China announced tougher measures on crypto trading, outlawing crypto-related transactions and services provided by off-shore crypto exchanges such as Binance.  Binance followed up on its intention to get in line with regulators in Singapore when it announced last week that it would restrict users’ access to certain services, including fiat deposits and spot trading of crypto.
