42378674,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lINL,1461702479,How Barclays Used R3's Tech to Build a Smart Contracts Prototype,"UK banking giant Barclays took another step toward positioning itself at the forefront of innovators in the blockchain sector last week with the news it had become the first to trial Corda, a new distributed ledger platform from partner R3CEV.  The prototype, demoed at the Barclays Accelerator in London last week, follows a particularly active period for Barclays, which earlier this month revealed it would provide banking services to blockchain payments startup Circle, and earlier this year, participated in a test of a private version of the Ethereum blockchain with 11 R3 member banks.  In interview, Dr Lee Braine of the Investment Bank CTO Office at Barclays, spoke to what it described as a broader need for leadership from the banking industry should the industry want blockchain technology to “reach maturity”.  Braine said that Barclays aims to devote time and expertise to the ecosystem, specifically to areas where banks have more experience than innovators. In particular, he cited Barclays and its drive to create smart contracts templates, as an example of this ongoing work.  Braine told CoinDesk:  ""What we’ve been doing in the last year, working with other banks through consortium and directly with startups, has been providing feedback around tech… In this case, we have subject matter expertise around legal documentation around the bank. Startups may not have that, so we thought by showcasing this, we’d look to encourage other banks to move into this space.""  To Braine, step one for the proof-of-concept was to determine how blockchain-based smart contracts could be connected to real-world legal contracts. This possibility, he said, could enable the simplification of legal documentation, while mutualizing costs.  Braine said that Barclays approached the challenge by devoting a full team to its incubator program for the project, during which these employees liaised heavily with internal legal teams working on derivatives.  ""We’ve taken in their preferences in order to build the interface,"" Braine said. ""The lifecycle, the workflow ... these aspects were driven by the legal document automation team.""  But Barclays is not alone in identifying this area as one where blockchain and distributed ledger tech could play a role. Industry startup CommonAccord, incubated in the BNP Paribas accelerator, has also set its sights on codifying and automating legal contracts.  Further, the efforts come amid a broader push from banking consortium R3 to reimagine blockchain-based processes as working for digital contracts, rather than digital assets.  The demo  In this repositioning, Barclays envisions the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA), a global trade association for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, as serving as a central repository for standardized, smart contract-enabled documents for use by traditional financial firms.  In an example provided to CoinDesk, Barclays illustrated how these newly created templates could be used to translate three lines of text into code executable on a distributed ledger.  Braine further manipulated fields in the documents to showcase how party names could be added to the agreements, with the contracts then being attached to trades.  ""Counterparties then review the trades. There it appears, they select it, they select the trade and affirm it. The smart contract is now set to a distributed ledger,"" he said.  In this envisioning, smart contract templates would be provided for banks to download and to use, Braine explained, with hashes of legal agreements, not the documents themselves, stored on the Corda distributed ledger.  ""Currently each bank stores its own instance [of contracts],"" Braine said. ""Therefore, if you want to look for, what are the governing documents, each bank would need to look to its own stores. There’s an opportunity to have a centralized store, as well as a replicated copy, but each of the parties to agreement would see the same set of legal documents.""  Even though banks involved would operate their own nodes on the ledger, he continued, hashes of changes would point back to the same originating document.  ""You can imagine there would be benefits in some degree of centralization around agreements. You can imagine a party upgrading their versions as they go through maturity, then a counterparty would add information or come back with comments,"" he said.  Choosing Corda  As for its choice of technology, Braine said that the test could have been replicated on other systems, and that the Ethereum blockchain was one such platform considered.  However, he said R3’s Corda platform was just maturing as it was seeking to roll out the initiative, and that an example interest rate swap had already been implemented on the platform, making it an ideal choice.  “There was a natural fit between the ISDA and what was implemented,” he said.  As for the test, Braine said it was “purely a prototype” being simulated with multiple “abstract” nodes.  “The interest rate swap was just a simulated product running on the nodes. There were indeed multiple nodes, they were communicating, but it was just a substantiation,” he said.  Interest rate swaps, Braine said, were an attractive test vehicle due to the fact that they are “one of the simpler” derivatives products. Yet, he noted that they had more complex features, such as a schedule that could be updated over time, which would allow Barclays to show the range of functionalities the technology could allow.  R3’s technology, he continued, is also unique in that, unlike existing blockchain or distributed ledger technologies, Corda could allow multiple financial firms and regulators to access a common blockchain-based data store, but with an expanded set of permissions that would respect business processes.  ""Data is not replicating to every node. Only those entitled to see it. Business logic is controlled by parameters for the templates,"" he said.  Braine showcased a demo whereby nodes were shown communicating with different classes of notes on the network, including regulators, rates services providers and time-stamping services.  Next steps  Still, Braine said that Barclays is seeking to build on the successful prototype.  For one, it aims to hold a ‘Smart Contracts Template’ summit in June with other industry stakeholders. Further, Braine said Barclays is going to continue to develop its code by improving the interface, its data repositories and exploring the use cases in more depth.  ""We’ve looked at interest rate swaps and I think we’ll look at at least two more in the coming three months, and then we’ll look to start prioritizing those,"" Braine said.  Braine said while the path ahead for the project is still uncertain, he was optimistic that the “next iteration” of the prototype would be in place by summer, at which point another demo of the technology could be made.  Braine, however, was cognizant of the challenges ahead, stating that the most challenging will come down to the “core infrastructure” around data stores for the transactions.  “For our demonstration, we went with the most standardized agreements,” he said, adding that other agreements will be more complicated, but that they will not be possible without the necessary groundwork.  Brain concluded:  ""You can imagine in the fullness of time, the scope could go beyond financial products, and for this idea, templates need to be expanded beyond that.""

42378663,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lIAl,1461693709,Vote Moves Europe Closer to AML Policy for Digital Currency Exchanges,"The European Parliament’s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs voted almost unanimously to adopt its report on virtual currencies today.  The 54-to-1 decision was one of the last hurdles for a measure that could lead to the creation of cryptocurrency task force before it is put before vote by the entire European Parliament.  Speaking with CoinDesk this afternoon, founder of the European Digital Currency and Blockchain Technology Forum (EDCAB) described the vote as part of a larger movement to regulate virtual currency exchange platforms under existing anti-money laundering (AML) controls.  EDCAB founder Siân Jones said:  ""It’s a significant step forward that signals encouragement and support whilst recognizing that there are for legislators and policy makers some challenges.""  Jones was one of three industry stakeholders to addresshttp://edcab.eu/blog/edcab-addresses-european-parliament-hearing-on-virtual-currencies members of the Parliament during a virtual currency public hearing earlier this year.  While passage of the report with near-unanimous agreement might be seen as broad support, the decision was not without effort. The original five-page document was eventually accompanied by an additional 62 pages of amendments, according to Jones.  Under terms of the report, virtual currency exchanges would fall under the purvey of existing AML controls and a new task force for overseeing other digital currency-related businesses would be created.  Despite the measures, Europe has long been thought of as having more favorable digital currency regulation than other developed nations, particularly the US.  For example, the European Court of Justice has exempted bitcoin transactions from Value Added Tax, effectively recognizing the digital currency as a means of payment on par with other currencies. By comparison, certain agencies in the US view bitcoin as property, meaning it is taxable based on the difference in price from purchase to sale, even if that sale is in a merchant transaction.  Today's development comes after the Internal Market for Consumer Protection Committee passed its own version of the report as the rules moves closer to a possible vote in a plenary session this May in front of all 751 members of European Parliament.

42378670,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lIIJ,1461685507,Brave’s Bitcoin Browser ‘Full Steam Ahead’ Despite Publisher Uproar,"In less than a month, Brave Software plans to open a bitcoin wallet on behalf of major content creators around the world so those publishers can receive micropayments in exchange for viewing specially curated ads.  Launched in 2015, Brave has raised $2.5m from private investors to build a browser that automatically blocks ads and gives users the option to replace some of those ads with those of Brave's partners as part of a revenue share program that pays both the content creator and the reader.  The problem is, many of the biggest publishers in the US, including The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal, want nothing to do with it.  On 7th April, the Newspaper Association of America published a cease-and-desist letter on behalf of those companies addressed to Brave’s CEO Brendan Eich, and threatened legal action if he continued to build his product.  Representatives of 1,200 members of the Newspaper Association of America posted the 1,000-word letter directly to the site, describing Brave’s business model as ""indistinguishable from a plan to steal our content to publish on your own website"". The publishers threatened legal action if Eich continued his work.  But in a conversation with CoinDesk, Eich said that not only has he not given up hope on someday working with those very same publishers, but that his plans to create bitcoin wallets on their behalf are unchanged.  Eich said:  ""We’ll try to get it set up so that people who have bitcoin can transfer it into the wallets we create and will be able to micropay for an ad-free experience. That’s independent of this ad-replacement idea and the legalities there of. We’re full steam ahead on that.""  The co-founder of Mozilla, and creator of the JavaScript programming language, Eich said he never actually received the letter from the Newspaper Association and learned of the threats from online media, tracking down the missive himself. The NAA tells CoinDesk the letter was sent both via email and conventional mail.  Later that same day, Eich posted his own letter addressing what he called the signatories' ""false assertions"" and ""misconcpetions about the product"", inviting the organization to have a discussion.  Eich told CoinDesk he’s yet to receive a formal response to the invitation, adding:  ""The model that they seem to have in their minds is ink on paper. It's as if you get The New York Times delivered to your doorstep and then Brave sneakily comes up before you open your door and pick up your newspaper and we've cut out the ads that they've carefully arranged to make money.""  Instead, Eich says Brave is building a tool that gives power to people who are already blocking ads to voluntarily turn some ads back on in exchange for increased power over their personal information, and what the CEO describes as a higher-quality advertising experience.  How it will work  Brave plans to replace only those ads that use third-party tracking technology that learns a user’s behavior and sells that information to advertisers — a practice Eich describes as ""dehumanizing"", adding that ""it makes the user feel like a serf, or an animal being bred for meat"".  In place of those ads, Brave plans to insert material from its own partners who don’t track personal information. For those ads, Brave plans to disperse between 55% and 70% of the revenue directly to the publishers.  The remaining funds are to be dispersed to Brave, the ad-matching partner, and if the user chooses, he or she is entitled to an optional 15% share of the advertising revenue, dispersed directly to their Brave Ledger bitcoin wallet built using technology from wallet provider BitGo.  Hierarchically deterministic, the Brave wallet can be shared with multiple systems. In this case, BitGo keeps one signature, Brave Software keeps another signature, and the third is sent to the BTC backup key provider, keytern.al.  Though Eich did briefly consider using a digital currency other than bitcoin, he decided the currency’s resiliency against attack gave it a clear advantage.  The big picture  Last year, ad blocking technology cost publishers an estimated $22bn in revenue, according a report published in partnership with Adobe by PageFair, a startup that has raised $1.2m venture capital to help counter ad blocking technology. Around the world, there are now 198 million active ad-block users, an increase of 41% over the 12 months preceding the report.  While the publishers may be understandably upset about technology designed to block the advertisements they use to pay the bills, a legal precedent is already taking shape around the world, according to a NetworkWorld report published earlier this month.  Eyeo, the company behind Adblock Plus has been sued five times in Germany and never lost.  Meanwhile, the techniques employed by some major publishers to side-step ad-blocking are also coming under increasing scrutiny.  Last month, advertisements on websites including the New York Times, the BBC, and AOL were hijacked in a form of ""malvertising"" that asked readers to pay a ransom to have their computers unlocked. In January, when Forbes asked its users to disable Adblock Plus to view the publication’s content, the site inadvertently exposed people to similar attacks.  ""Something is really out of control if these news organizations in particular can’t control the ads that get onto the user's browser,"" said Eich.  The long road ahead  To Eich’s perspective, not only is Brave not a threat to the publishing industry, it may be its savior.  ""As long as the payments were sufficient, I think we might actually be not in their sights,"" he said. ""They might actually be happy, and they might even partner with us.""  Though Eich says he’s still not received a formal acceptance of his offer to meet with the publishers, he tells CoinDesk he has ""various back-channels"" going and is optimistic that someday the publishers might actually view him as a partner.  Eich told CoinDesk:  ""I have some lines of communication open and I’ll just leave it at that. We’re hopeful that things will continue, that things will improve from there.""  However, the president and CEO of the Newspaper Association, David Chavern, is less optimistic. In a statement sent to Coindesk, Chavern wrote that his organization continues to support its members' interests as laid out in the cease-and-desist letter.  He wrote:  ""While we appreciate Brave's interest in defending its business model, and would not have expected otherwise. We continue to view their proposition as crossing legal boundaries.""  Setting a micropayment precedent  There's more at stake in this dispute than just advertising revenue for the publishing industry.  As far back as 2009 Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonym used by the person or people who created bitcoin listed micropayment fees as a way to limit the number of emails one receives and as a means for subscription sites to ensure that free trials don’t ""cannibalize"" their revenue.  In 2010 Nakamoto wrote:  ""While I don't think bitcoin is practical for smaller micropayments right now, it will eventually be as storage and bandwidth costs continue to fall. If bitcoin catches on on a big scale, it may already be the case by that time.""  While it's still widely debated if bitcoin has hit critical mass as Nakamoto put it, the digital currency has been on a steady uptick for the past couple months, currently worth about $460 each.  Last June, we wrote about how some developers hoped micropayments could be used to further increase bitcoin adoption through such products as the Lightning Network and Duplex Micropayments Channels.  Then, last month, 21 Inc launched its own Micropayments Marketplace where users can buy services ranging from speech tagging services to email verification for $0.0274 and $0.0091 respectively.  If successfully integrated into the online economy, mircopayments could be a $925bn industry by 2025, according to a Wedbush Securities report.  What’s already in place  At the moment, Eich isn’t sharing the exact number of users who have downloaded the browser. The micropayments feature isn’t yet activated and its ad-replacement service only shows placeholder ads featuring Brave’s logo and the words, ""Faster, safer ads coming soon to this place.""  On Friday, Brave launched version 0.9.2 with support for Windows 32-bit, support for 1Password integration, defenses against browser fingerprinting and the ability to set Brave as the default browser within the Control Panel on Windows.  While the 17 companies that signed the cease-and-desist letter represented 1,200 publications, the NAA’s total membership represents nearly 2,000 companies, and not all publishers are so vehemently against Brave’s business model.  Though Eich wouldn’t say which company, he told CoinDesk he is currently in discussions with an agency that he said has ""existing brand relationships"" and is interested in working with Brave. He expects the fully functioning system will be active in the next 12-to-18 months.  According to Brave’s GitHub page, bitcoin wallets will automatically be created for each publisher on 20th May so they can receive ad revenue from the company’s partners and micropayments from readers.  Eich told CoinDesk:  ""When we turn it on and test it and prove that it works with some very early test wallets, then bring it open to the public, people can start using bitcoin to sponsor sites by dropping money on them in exchange for ad-blocking instead of simply using a sheer ad-blocker.""

42378669,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lIDH,1461677805,Gem Partners With Philips for Blockchain Healthcare Initiative,"Blockchain tech specialist Gem officially launched Gem Health today, an initiative aimed at promoting collaboration in the healthcare space centered on the emerging technology.  As part of the announcement, Gem unveiled its first partner on the effort, Philips, which will assist Gem as it seeks to build out a private Ethereum blockchain for use in the development of enterprise healthcare applications.  In interview, Gem CEO Micah Winkelspecht described the effort as a way to encourage the healthcare industry to explore the potential benefits blockchain could have in the creation of wellness apps, global patient ID software and secure electronic medical records.  Winkelspecht told CoinDesk:  “We’re launching a network that will allow the healthcare companies to participate in pilots and build cross-industry applications to solve different use case. We’re helping to establish that environment with companies that have been largely working in silos.”  As part of this push, Winkelspecht said Gem is investing in communications channels and physical events aimed at the industry.  As for Gem’s role in the management of its new private blockchain system, Winkelspecht said that the startup’s intent is not to ""own the network"", but rather position itself as a consultant and match-maker for firms in the sector working on blockchain projects.  Winkelspecht framed the move as part of Gem’s larger move toward offering enterprise services following its pivot from its original positioning as an API provider for bitcoin startups. Further, he spoke in broad terms about the benefits blockchain could have for healthcare, stressing the benefits technological improvements in the sector may have on society.  Winkelspecht said:  ""This is a very large opportunity, but an important one. Healthcare affects everyone and we saw an opportunity to be able to help change an entire industry that.""
