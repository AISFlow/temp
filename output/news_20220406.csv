42395653,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASyJh1,1649289562,Cosmos-Based Juno Blockchain Pushed Offline in Apparent Attack,"Cosmos-based blockchain Juno went offline on Tuesday as the result of a suspected attack on the network.  The network remains offline as of press time, but no user funds have been impacted and the Juno core development team says a fix is in the works, according to a retweet from the project’s official Twitter handle.  A Juno core developer speaking to CoinDesk on the condition of anonymity said the network crash stemmed from a malicious smart contract masked to look like a simple “hello world” program.  The suspected attacker sent a string of over 400 transactions to the smart contract over the course of three days in a process of apparent trial and error – eventually landing on a specific combination of transactions that crashed the network.  According to the developer who spoke with CoinDesk, the attacker exploited a blockchain vulnerability that Juno planned to address via an update scheduled for a few hours after the attack. The developer says the vulnerability had been publicly disclosed, as it impacted all blockchains that use the CosmWasm smart contract platform.  This is the second major challenge Juno has faced in the past month. In March a controversial governance vote removed tokens from a “whale” accused of manipulating a JUNO airdrop – an unprecedented case of a decentralized community directly voting to cut a wallet’s token balance.  The JUNO token, which has a $1 billion market cap according to CoinGecko, has dropped 7% in the past 24 hours.  Read more: Juno's Proposal 16 Vote Is a Watershed for Blockchain Governance – For Better or Worse  As of now, the identity of the attacker is unknown.  According to Daniel Hwang, head of protocols at Stakefish, which runs a validator for Juno, members of the Juno community are trying to figure out who would have been motivated to execute the attack for no obvious financial gain. According to Hwang, token holders are pointing fingers at potential culprits ranging from competitor blockchains to bagholders on the losing end of last month’s governance vote.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | AIRDROP,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/04/06/cosmos-based-juno-blockchain-pushed-offline-in-apparent-attack,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6c468269485a845d35ee63e39e7fea011e274b91-5184x3456.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

BTC assets under management had grown exponentially in this one-month period to touch a new all-time high. This is propelled forward by the inflows that have categorized these ETPs in the last month. This has made March one of the most successful months for bitcoin ETPs as all BTC products have marked positive net flows over this time period. Bitcoin AUM At New All-Time High The total bitcoin AUM had gone up dramatically in March. Looking at the numbers show this movement to be one of the highest growth trends ever recorded in this regard. The previous one was the jump that was recorded back in November of 2021. By February, the total asset under management had been sitting at 190,165 BTC. However, by the end of March, this number had grown as high as 202,437 BTC.

Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin, ether and other major cryptos fell significantly amid continued macroeconomic turmoil and new evidence of the U.S. Federal Reserve's move to hawkishness.  Insights: South Korea's ""kimchi premium"" has largely evaporated, although the country's climate for crypto has been favorable lately.  Technician's take: BTC broke below a month-long uptrend, but the broad recovery off January lows remains intact.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis. And sign up for First Mover,our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $43,723 -4.8%  Ether (ETH): $3,216 -6.8%  Top Gainers  There are no gainers in CoinDesk 20 today.  Top Losers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Ethereum Classic ETC −12.9% Smart Contract Platform Dogecoin DOGE −11.2% Currency Filecoin FIL −10.9% Computing  Bitcoin, other cryptos slide  Crypto and equity markets haven't always been in step in recent months.  But on Wednesday they were, following another day of macroeconomic turmoil stemming from Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine and fresh evidence of the U.S. central bank's transformation into a monetary hawk.  Bitcoin (BTC) was recently trading below $44,000, where it dropped earlier in the day less than a week after soaring over $47,000. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was off nearly 5%. Ether (ETH), the second-largest crypto by market cap, fell on even harder times, tumbling almost 7% to change hands just above $3,200.  All major altcoins in the CoinDesk top 20 by market cap, were even further in the red with SOL down over 10% and ADA and DOT each down about 8% at certain points. The meme coins DOGE and SHIB were off about 12% and 9%, respectively.  Meanwhile, U.S. equity markets fell, with the Nasdaq off 2.2%, following the release of minutes from the Federal Reserve's March meeting in which governors discussed raising interest rates in half-point increments. Fed Chair Jerome Powell last week broached the possibility of a half-point hike as a way to tamp down inflation, which at nearly 8% has hit a four-decade high and could potentially increase as the conflict in Ukraine rages, sabotaging energy prices and global supply chains.  Brent crude oil, a widely regarded measure of energy prices, continued trading over $101 per barrel, a massive increase over the start of the year when it was priced at under $80 per barrel.  The U.S. and other countries that have criticized Russia's aggression took steps to impose full sanctions against Russia's largest financial services companies, including Sberbank, the country's largest financial institution. The countries had previously only imposed partial sanctions on the companies. Sberbank, which holds about one-third of Russia's assets, will now lack any contact with the U.S. banking system.  The sanctions are meant to cripple the Russian economy, which has been able to make debt payments from revenue it receives from energy sales and through limited access to foreign banking. The U.S. has urged European Union countries to ban the Russian oil and gas imports, upon which they are heavily dependent.  In an interview with CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program, Scott Freeman, co-founder and partner of financial services firm JST Capital, suggested the global unrest was hurting bitcoin's price, despite major buys over the past 10 days by Terra's Luna Foundation and MicroStrategy (MSTR), which purchased over $190 million in the crypto this week. ""It's hard to lay a finger on the movement of bitcoin right now,"" Freeman said. ""At the end of the day, we believe there are business macro themes in the environment where people are just not looking to put risk-on right now. People look for opportunities to sell and to profit.""  But, Freeman added: ""We think, longer term, bitcoin and crypto are really good places to put some percentage of your portfolio.""  Markets  S&P 500: 4,481 -0.9%  DJIA: 34,496 -0.4%  Nasdaq: 13,888 -2.2%  Gold: $1,925 +0.2%  Insights  Bitcoin's kimchi premium evaporates  Bitcoin traded at a discount of 3.2% relative to the U.S. dollar on South Korean markets last week after the launch of new crypto regulations, crypto market data firm Kaiko noted.  That's a market shift from prior years, when South Korea’s unique regulatory framework, which restricts cross-border capital transfers for foreigners, led to a “kimchi premium'' – a gap between bitcoin prices on Korean crypto exchanges compared with global counterparts. Bitcoin traded at over 20% higher at one point last year. The premium also reflects local market demand.  However, for the first time in years this premium has turned into a discount as traders anticipated the adoption of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) ""travel rule,"" Kaiko said.  The rule requires crypto service providers to collect and disclose customer information for all transactions above a particular threshold.  The Kimchi premium's recent flip to a discount might mark the end – for now anyway – of an iconic crypto arbitrage trade, one that several traders and firms, including FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, exploited in its heyday.  Crypto in South Korea has been riding favorable winds lately.  Last week, The Korean Herald reported that SK Square, the investment arm of South Korean conglomerate SK Group, would spend 2 trillion won (US$1.6 billion) in the next three years on semiconductors and blockchain.  SK Square's CEO and Vice Chairman Park Jung-ho noted the ""high growth potential"" of ""chips and blockchain,"" in comments to the newspaper. Rising demand for chips and other components that enable blockchain platforms are a sometimes overlooked benefit of the industry's rapid growth.  Separately, SK Square, part of the SK Group behemoth of 95 separate companies, has established a task force to launch what would be the first token of its kind by a South Korean top 10 conglomerate, often called a chaebol.  The country's newly elected president has promised crypto-friendly policies that include legal measures to confiscate crypto profits gained through illegitimate means and to ensure their return to victims.  Technician's take  Bitcoin Extends Pullback Toward $40K-$43K Support  Bitcoin (BTC) remains in pullback mode after failing to break above the $48,000 resistance level last week.  BTC was down by as much as 4% over the past 24 hours, which is less than some popular alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins), indicating a lower appetite for risk among crypto traders.  On intraday charts, BTC broke below a month-long uptrend. That means short-term sellers are in control, especially after the breakout level around $45,000 was rejected on Tuesday.  Recent breakdowns on the charts have confirmed negative momentum signals, although pullbacks appear to be limited. For now, the broader recovery from January lows remains intact.

The largest tech giants, including Amazon, Google and Meta Platforms, have become too accustomed to the outdated business models of ad monetization, an industry that is growing 15.7% annually.  Ad tech is still an appealing opportunity, but blockchain has a much higher growth potential.  Dusan Kovacic is the Chief Investment Officer of Rockaway Blockchain Fund, a VC investing into digital assets and infrastructure.  Traction metrics in Web 3 are growing through the roof. For example, daily active addresses on Ethereum grew from 200,000 in January 2020 to 550,000 today, increasing about 65% per year..  Revenue of Ethereum skyrocketed from $200,000 per week in January 2020 to $31 million per week today. And the rise of new layer 1 protocols shows even more impressive growth. Solana daily active addresses grew from zero in January 2020 to 550,000 now, the same level as Ethereum.  Continuing to master the 20-year-old online advertising business model is not interesting enough for top talent any more. These people – some of the smartest and most educated among us – are looking for new opportunities that Web 3 happily provides.  This trend may have started with the “creator economy” as more independent-minded people sought their own opportunities and has bled into Web 3’s “ownership economy.”  Read more: NFTs, DAOs and the New Creator Economy  We are seeing a massive inflow of technologists. The Electric Capital developer report of public GitHub repositories associated with blockchain projects shows 100% growth since last year.  It’s not only the developers, but executive talent, too. The former chief marketing officer (CMO) of Meta's wallet project, Novi, took a CMO position at Circle; the former general manager of Amazon's AWS Edge Services is now chief technology officer of Gemini, and Lyft's former finance chief and Uber's ex-director of corporate development have both joined OpenSea.  Then there's Chris Lehane, a former Airbnb executive, who left for a crypto venture capital fund, while YouTube's former head of gaming jumped over to Polygon Studios, which caters to Web 3 developers. The list goes on and on.  Add to this the immense funding that blockchain startups received in 2021 – $33 billion, which was 8.1 times the amount from the previous year.  Read more: How to Make Blockchain a New Kind of Economic Engine  The demand for tech talent in Web 3 is massive. In the U.K., job postings mentioning blockchain are at an all-time high, and according to LinkedIn, job postings in the industry saw growth of 400% since 2020.  And at Rockaway Blockchain Fund, we are seeing the interest in this technology with our own eyes. Each of our portfolio companies is hiring. At the Hacker House in Prague, which we co-hosted with Solana, there were more than 30 teams presenting on demo day, and 800 developers present from all across Europe, either building or looking to extend their teams.  We are expecting a similar turnout at the upcoming Gateway Conference and Hackathon in Prague for the Cosmos ecosystem. This is massive growth since our pre-COVID hackathon with Binance & Oasis Labs, where roughly 30 developers attended.  This data showcases the traction of the industry and solidifies our conviction as long-term, value-add investors in Web 3. Combining the incentive alignment of the ownership economy of Web 3 with top tech talent and massive funding is exactly what a venture investor looks for.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | SOL | TECHNOLOGY,Dusan Kovacic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/coindesk/2022/04/06/top-talent-is-migrating-to-web-3,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/abaffaabe3a6d67b92dbd072481d115bce2367a3-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The SEC announced the approval Wednesday in a filing on its website, adding Teucrium to a host of other bitcoin futures ETF issuers.  Read More: What Is a Bitcoin Futures ETF?  Notably, Teucrium and NYSE Arca filed the application under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, filing a 19b-4 form with the SEC. The already-approved bitcoin futures ETFs filed by other companies were under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which follows a slightly different regulatory pathway to approval.  An approval under the Securities Act of 1933, under which Teucrium's filing falls, may potentially open the door for a spot bitcoin ETF, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart said on Twitter earlier this year. Proponents of crypto ETFs have argued that ""like situations must be treated alike,"" he said, citing an argument from crypto company Grayscale, which filed to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Fund (GBTC) to an ETF. (Grayscale is a subsidiary of CoinDesk parent company Digital Currency Group).  The SEC has, to date, disapproved all spot bitcoin ETF applications, citing concerns about market manipulation and a lack of a surveillance-sharing agreement between an ETF issuer and a sizable market that trades the underlying asset. That has not stopped various companies from trying to bring a bitcoin ETF to market.  ProShares, Valkyrie and VanEck are among those approved to list and trade bitcoin futures ETFs in the U.S. so far.  Valkyrie has also filed to launch a 33 Act bitcoin futures ETF.

Meta Financial Technologies has been exploring the creation of a virtual currency for the metaverse, or “Zuck Bucks” as it’s being referred to by company employees, the FT reported, citing several people familiar with the matter.  The latest move comes not long after the company’s ill-fated move into cryptocurrency. What was left of Meta’s Libra/Diem stablecoin project was sold to Silvergate Bank earlier this year. The FT reported that Meta doesn’t envision a blockchain-based digital currency, but in-app tokens that are centrally controlled by the company.  The planning reportedly remains in early stages, and the project could be dropped or altered, or both, according to the FT. Meta is also said to be exploring a move into traditional financial services, such as small business lending.  Efforts at integrating non-fungible tokens (NFTs) into Facebook and Instagram are more developed, the report said. According to an internal memo, Instagram will soon support NFTs and there are plans for a mid-May pilot launch for posting NFTs on Facebook.  A Meta company spokesperson told CoinDesk it didn’t have new plans to share at this time.  “We continuously consider new product innovations for people, businesses and creators.

We have shifted from Web 1.0 to Web 2.0 and now Web 3.0. There have been innovations such as decentralized finance (DeFi), blockchain, the metaverse, cryptocurrencies, and even distributed ledgers. For the past few years, cryptocurrencies have been the latest hype among investors, with a market capitalization of $2.2 trillion as of December 2021. Cryptocurrencies, however, have not received the best welcome from everybody. Governments worldwide are looking to regulate them, with China and Singapore already banning crypto transactions. The reason is that they have been associated with money laundering and criminal activity. With crypto issues such as high volatility, scalability, security, and limited use cases, maybe it is about time we shifted focus to DeFi and Web 3. Changing How Finance Works With DeFi and Web3, consumers will be able to manage their finances in a whole new way. Notably, DeFi forms the basis of blockchain technology and digital assets. DeFi is a type of finance that, as the name indicates, does not rely on centralized intermediaries (such as banks) to function because everything is already on the blockchain.

So far there are no blockchain infrastructure providers in Latin America preventing slashing events and providing constant monitoring for clients such as exchanges and protocol foundations, SenseiNode CEO Pablo Larguía told CoinDesk.  Investors have been pouring capital into firms doing the dirty work of making sure nodes, the computers that keep blockchains up-to-date with the latest transactions, remain fully functional.  Blockdaemon and Alchemy are two of the largest crypto infrastructure firms worldwide. In January, Blockdaemon raised $207 million at a $3.25 billion valuation, while Alchemy became a decacorn after a $200 million equity investment at a $10.2 billion valuation.  Read more: Web 3 Infrastructure Giant Alchemy Tops $10B Valuation in $200M Funding Round  Over the past six months SenseiNode ran tests of its services and deployed 50 nodes with 11 blockchains, including Ethereum, Algorand, Solana, Polkadot and Avalanche, Larguía said. In 2022 the company plans to deploy more than 500 nodes in the region, with a major focus on Brazil and Mexico, followed by Argentina and Colombia, he added.  Fewer than 1% of nodes worldwide are based in Latin America, Larguía said, based on Ethereum statistics as of March 31. While the U.S. has 2,459, the region’s largest country, Brazil, counts only 29. The dearth of nodes, especially as Web 3 usage climbs in the region, is striking.  According to Larguía, in places like the U.S. the majority of nodes are hosted on services provided by Amazon or Microsoft, hampering the decentralization of blockchain infrastructure.  By contrast, Latin America has a “super fragmented” data center industry, providing the region with “a great competitive advantage,” Larguía said.

Meanwhile, alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) declined such as ether (ETH) by 5%, a 14% drop in RUNE and an 11% fall in DOGE.  Despite the crypto pullback, the Luna Foundation Guard continues to stack up the bitcoin. The foundation has roughly 35,767 in BTC worth about $1.5 billion in its reserve, which is larger than the $1.2 billion worth of BTC held by the electric-car maker Tesla (TSLA).

Bitcoin dominance uptick  The chart below shows a slight uptick in bitcoin's dominance ratio, or its market cap relative to the total crypto market cap, over the past 24 hours. That suggests a lower appetite for risk among crypto traders.  Still, the recent uptick does not represent a changing trend. The dominance ratio has been capped below 47% since October of last year and remains in a year-long range. A decisive breakout above 50% (bearish) or a breakdown below 40% (bullish) would signal a shift from neutral to risk-on or risk-off. For now, it appears that some crypto buyers remain on the sidelines.

As sellers flow back, the coin may dump to retest $0.19. Past Performance Stellar Lumens is free-falling at spot rates, dropping 12 percent versus the USDT in the past 24 hours. Technically, XLM remains in a bullish breakout pattern above a multi-week resistance trend line as prices bottom up. However, following today&apos;s losses, sellers are pressing lower in a possible retracement after a 44 percent surge from 2022 lows. Stellar Lumens Technical Analysis In the immediate term, sellers are in the driving seat. There are lower lows versus the upper BB as XLM prices slide below crucial support levels and the 20-day moving average. Notably, the April 6 bear engulfing bull bar reversing recent gains is with markedly high trading volumes, further confirming the losses of April 5. Therefore, as XLM trends lower in a possible cool-off, traders may find entries on every pullback towards $0.22 to unload with targets at $0.19. What to Expect from XLM? XLM is under intense selling pressure at spot rates. Although there might be an over-extension to the downside, traders may unpack on pullbacks towards $0.22.

Ethereum gained its position due to its smart contracts and its versatility in handling all kinds of transactions. This platform has gained the moniker &apos;the internet of assets&apos; due to its diverse application in multiple sectors. The platform has had diverse applications, such as the development of a cryptocurrency, ownership of assets, and project development. The diverse applications have seen the platform&apos;s value bloom over the last few years. However, this growth has recently stalled. This stalling is due to some issues that have weighed down the monolithic technological platform and competition from other blockchain platforms. As a result, changes to the platform in the form of the Ethereum Merge were announced and rolled out. This merge is considered a historical moment in the Crypto world. This article will explore the impact of ETH merge on its supply, the environment, and its holders. What is the Ethereum Merge? The term merge refers to a number of changes to the Ethereum network that will roll out from June 2022. The merge is typically a change from the proof-of-work (PoW) system currently used to the proof-of-stake (PoS) system that is common in newer blockchains.

In the 2017-19 period, when the Fed last attempted to shrink its balance sheet, the maximum reduction was capped at $50 billion, significantly lower than what the central bank is signaling this year.  With the release of the minutes this month, the Fed is laying the groundwork for its upcoming meeting on May 4-5, signaling traders what to expect in the coming months, which is why the impact of the central bank’s decisions can already be seen now.

42395644,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASyJZ9,1649271614,Top US Lawmaker Proposes Sweeping Stablecoin Regulation Framework,"A leading member of the Senate Banking Committee introduced a bill Wednesday to create a three-pronged regulatory framework for stablecoin issuers in the U.S.  Sen. Patrick Toomey (R-Pa.), the ranking member of the committee, announced the ""Stablecoin Transparency of Reserves and Uniform Safe Transactions Act of 2022,"" dubbed the Stablecoin TRUST Act for short, as part of an effort to specify how the U.S.'s different regulatory agencies could approach companies issuing cryptocurrencies whose prices are pegged to the U.S. dollar or other assets.  As written, the discussion draft of the bill would define a ""payment stablecoin,"" authorize the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to create a new license specific to stablecoin issuers, allow insured depository banks to issue payment stablecoins and address state regulatory oversight of this segment of the crypto industry.  ""Payment stablecoins"" would include stablecoins issued by a centralized entity, are pegged to and can be converted to a fiat currency (or currencies), are ""designed to be widely used as a medium of exchange,"" do not confer interest and where transactions are recorded on a ""public distributed ledger.""  Stablecoin issuers would have to choose between securing the OCC license, a state money transmitter or similar license or a traditional bank charter. These companies would be subject to a disclosure regime that would require them to secure regular attestations, detail redemption policies and specify what actually backs the stablecoins they issue.  OCC-licensed issuers would also have access to the Federal Reserve's master account system, which would give them the ability to tap the broader financial system and larger amounts of liquidity in transacting.  In remarks introducing the bill, Toomey said the bill would clarify that payment stablecoins are not securities.  ""I think there's a growing awareness that this category is not going away,"" Toomey said.  Open questions  Lawmakers in the U.S. and around the world have closely scrutinized stablecoins since social media giant Facebook introduced the short-lived Libra (later Diem) project in 2019.  The House of Representatives Financial Services Committee held a hearing earlier this year focused on the issue specifically, based on a President's Working Group on Financial Markets report addressing stablecoins from 2021.  Last month, Sen. Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.) and Rep. Trey Hollingsworth (R-Ind.) introduced a bill of their own aimed at forcing stablecoin issuers to provide further transparency about the reserves backing their circulating tokens.  On Wednesday, Toomey said he focused on his ""payment stablecoin"" term as algorithmic stablecoins (and seemingly decentralized stablecoins at large) may behave differently from the cryptocurrencies his bill addresses.  The discussion draft of a bill is meant to circulate and garner feedback, rather than be immediately introduced as possible legislation. Toomey, whose term ends at the end of the year, has announced he will not seek re-election, meaning he has roughly eight months to chart a path forward for the proposal if it is not passed by Congress by 2023.  In a statement, Toomey noted that stablecoins are currently mainly used for cryptocurrency trades, but suggested they could be used in the broader economy in future.

58090,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=487647,1649271603,Bitcoin Trading Volume Continues To Remain At Low Levels,"Data shows the Bitcoin trading volume has continued to remain at low levels this week, weakening the latest rally in the crypto&apos;s price. Bitcoin Spot Trading Volume Has Recently Stabilized At Low Values As per the latest weekly report from Arcane Research, the BTC spot volume has continued to stabilize at relatively low values this week. The &apos;daily trading volume&apos; is an on-chain indicator that measures the total amount of Bitcoin being transacted on the network on any given day. When the value of this metric goes up, it means a higher number of coins are moving on the chain at the moment. This shows that the network is turning more active as investors become more interested in the crypto. On the other hand, a decrease in the Bitcoin volume suggests market activity is dipping down. Such a trend may imply that the general interest around the coin is low right now. It can also mean investors are waiting for the price to reach a certain level before they make their move.

42394255,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvah33,1649268119,Waves Founder Blames Short Sellers for Its Woes. Here's Why That's a Red Flag,"A complex and increasingly bitter drama is unfolding at Waves, a layer 1, or base, smart-contract blockchain.  The system, an Ethereum analog with smart contract and decentralized finance (DeFi) functionality, has seen extreme price volatility in its eponymous native token over the past few days, while its algorithmic stablecoin, neutrino USD (USDN), has dramatically broken its dollar peg. The neutrino stablecoin is widely considered the main utility of the Waves blockchain, so the broken peg threatens the entire system.  The causes for that chaos are disputed, but what’s most notable is the Waves team’s seemingly unprecedented response.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in crypto news. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Arguing that short sellers are fueling the chaos, founder Sasha Ivanov is championing a proposed system change that would make it impossible to borrow large amounts of WAVES tokens through the system’s primary decentralized exchange (DEX), Vires Finance.  Because WAVES is a relatively thinly traded asset of little interest to institutions like hedge funds, traders tell CoinDesk that it is nearly impossible to borrow outside of Vires Finance. Borrowing an asset is essential to shorting, or betting its price will fall. So the Waves proposal would in essence make it very difficult or impossible to short the WAVES token.  Blame the shorts (crypto edition)  The decision to publicly blame short sellers for the Waves system’s woes may mark the first time a crypto project has pursued the same rhetorical strategy as a long list of troubled, traditional, publicly traded companies.  Many companies that attack short sellers ultimately turn out to be engaged in fraud, with my favorite recent example being Nikola, a supposed electric vehicle manufacturer that briefly threatened to sue short sellers before ultimately admitting to having faked its product demo.  More famously, Enron CEO Ken Lay blamed short sellers for the company’s problems in statements made in 2006 – while he was on trial for overseeing the biggest corporate fraud in history. To longtime finance observers, blaming shorts often comes across as the last desperate deflection of a project in denial about its own failure.  Anti-short rhetoric is common among unstable or dishonest projects because, in reality, shorts are structurally incentivized to only attack for very good reasons. In part that’s because shorting is extremely high risk, with potentially uncapped losses if the value of an asset being shorted goes up instead of down. It’s not something that any serious trader or fund does lightly, and often it’s a move made by traders who think they see something the rest of the market does not.  That means shorts often engage in public campaigns to spread awareness about their “short thesis,” or the reason they believe an asset will fall. This casts a different light on Ivanov’s allegations of a “FUD campaign” organized by Alameda Research, a sister company of the FTX exchange. Even taken at face value, a public short campaign by a firm as serious as Alameda would be a sell signal to any sane trader, and not mere “fear, uncertainty and doubt.”  But it’s not actually clear that Alameda is engaging in a WAVES short on its own account, much less a public campaign around it. On Twitter, Ivanov claimed that a $30 million borrowing of WAVES through Vires can be linked back to Alameda. A representative for Vires declined to clarify the source of that information, and some have argued the move amounts to Ivanov doxing a user.  Meanwhile, some believe these loans may represent borrowing on behalf of Alameda clients rather than the firm’s proprietary trades. Alameda founder, and FTX CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried on Twitter dismissed allegations of a coordinated “FUD” publicity campaign as an “obv bulls**t conspiracy theory.” Alameda declined to confirm or deny to CoinDesk whether it has or had a short position in WAVES.  The rest of the story  A short against WAVES would not be a particularly surprising or personally motivated move by any trading firm. In the days leading up to the current drama, there was an increasing drumbeat of criticism of specific financial decisions made by the Waves team, and clear-eyed predictions of the token’s crash.  On March 31, a pseudonymous Twitter user known as 0xHamz called Waves “the biggest [P]onzi in crypto,” claiming the Waves team was printing its neutrino stablecoin and using it to artificially pump the WAVES token. At that point, WAVES had just seen a massive and sharp price spike, nearly doubling in value. But 0xHamz predicted that the consequence of the moves would be a crash of the WAVES token and a depegging of the USDN stablecoin.  That proved wildly prescient. The neutrino stablecoin has dropped as low as 76 cents on the dollar in the days since, before rebounding to 91 cents Wednesday morning. The issuance of neutrino is one of the primary use cases of the WAVES network and token, with nearly $1 billion of the stablecoin in circulation against WAVES’ $2.7 billion market cap. That could make the de-pegging of USDN an existential threat for the entire Waves ecosystem, and the WAVES token itself has crashed back below its pre-pump level.  Read more:Waves' USDN Stablecoin Loses Peg, Drops 15% Amid Manipulation Scare  0xHamz also made the far more serious allegation, based on blockchain data, that Ivanov personally moved a massive $300 million pile of WAVES tokens to Binance, saying the move “could be an imminent dump.” In a Twitter Space organized by Waves on April 5, 0xHamz was invited to discuss his allegations directly with Ivanov.  Ivanov declined to publicly refute the claims that he is dumping WAVES tokens, instead arguing that 0xHamz was not a real person and making vague threats against the critic. “What you do is bullshit. You're a troll ... Maybe your voice is generated by AI, I don’t know,” said Ivanov. “I would be happy to meet somewhere and discuss in private. I can show you everything, my friend, and you don’t do your homework at all. What you do is crap. It’s baseless accusations.  ""And if you’re a real person, my friend you can actually have some legal problems. So I suggest you think [about] what you do.”  This sort of menacing language from corporate or crypto leaders is often a gigantic red flag. Founders so emotionally fragile they resort to threatening critics rather than addressing their questions are not reliable stewards – a realization that apparently came to Ivanov a few minutes later when he insisted that “I am not making threats.”  The big stop  Despite the surrounding drama, the proposal to cut off short sellers remains the most interesting part of the story. The proposal, which Ivanov has endorsed, opened for voting on April 5 and will run until April 10.  Currently, the proposal is barely passing. Many responses have argued that it is at best contrary to the spirit of crypto because it forecloses legitimate economic activity. And while blocking short sellers could boost the price of WAVES in the short term, experts say the proposal is likely to prove damaging to WAVES over the long term.  According to Jeff Dorman at crypto asset management firm Arca, the chaos may have already increased short pressure rather than easing it. Institutions and hedge funds uninterested in holding WAVES on its merits, he says, “are all probably scrambling right now to find a WAVES holder to get a borrow from [to enable shorting], but they are likely unsuccessful in doing so. The negative funding rate [for WAVES] on FTX, for example, is indicative of how little borrow there is, as those who want to short have resorted to selling perpetual futures.”  In other words, it’s so hard to find actual WAVES tokens to sell short that bears are willing to pay up for derivative contracts that would profit from the asset’s eventual fall.  Putting up a shield against shorts would further limit such activity, but it’s by no means a sure win for WAVES.  “Messing with free markets also has other long-term consequences, including reducing liquidity,” Dorman says. That “would make long-term holders more concerned [and] could negatively impact [WAVES’s] price.""

After the digital asset had successfully broken above $47,000, it had been subsequently beaten down by the bears. This was a result of an important resistance point that proved impossible for bitcoin to beat at the time. It continues to struggle with this point even now and has declined into the $44,000 territory. This point remains the level to beat for the cryptocurrency to once more register a bullish trend. Bitcoin Fails To Break Resistance Bitcoin establishing a bullish trend can sometimes be a tricky thing. This is due to the fact that as the price grows, the resistance being mounted by bears at various levels becomes increasingly hard to beat. This was the case at the $47,500 level where bitcoin had met significant resistance. Failure to break above this level had sent the digital asset spiraling back down and eventually landing in the low $40,000s. Related Reading | TA: Bitcoin Tops Near $47K, Why The Bulls Must Defend $45K This point is pertinent for bitcoin to beat given that it is the major resistance between the asset and the coveted $50,000 price point.

42395673,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASyONG,1649264232,XRP Army Drives Bumper Sales in Ripple Stock Despite SEC Probe,"Accredited investors are falling over themselves to grab pre-IPO equity in budding cryptocurrency unicorns like BlockFi, Dapper Labs and Kraken, according to Linqto, a firm that buys equity in young tech firms before they hit the public markets.  But out of a crypto-heavy basket of unlisted company shares, Ripple Labs, creator of the XRP token, is the stock that Linqto users are buying the most.  “We don’t act like a broker, but rather we put our money upfront and buy pre-IPO tech company shares from early founders, investors and employees that need to liquidate shares for whatever reason – that might be to buy a house or send a kid to college,” Nick Burrafato, director of digital asset sales at Linqto, said in an interview.  “We also retain ownership of a percentage of each and every investment we make until the company exits,"" he said.  It’s perhaps no surprise there’s a strong demand for private equity in crypto companies given events like crypto exchange Coinbase’s direct listing last year. Coinbase's stock was changing hands on the Linqto platform at $32 a share just nine months before it listed at over $350, according to Burrafato.  To date, more than $50 million of private equity in Ripple Labs has been sold since Linqto launched two years ago, Burrafato said. And that’s despite the crypto firm’s legal wranglings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  Ripple has long made its intentions of going public clear. In January 2020, CEO Brad Garlinghouse said an initial public offering was a “natural evolution” for the company, hinting that a listing could occur later that year. Following the SEC's action against Ripple Labs in December 2020, he said the firm would wait until the issue was resolved before going public.  “We were selling Ripple shares long before the SEC case,” Burrafato said. “Many of our members hold digital assets and they were emboldened by this case with the SEC, and decided they wanted to have a piece of Ripple equity as well as XRP.”  Linqto has a long-standing agreement with the Uphold trading platform to allow users to pay for their chosen slice of private equity using cryptocurrency, including XRP, which has a significant presence on the Uphold.  “Uphold has lots of users who are part of the XRP Army, if you will, so there’s an affinity there,” Uphold Chief Revenue Officer Robin O’Connell said in an interview.",POSITIVE,XRP,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/04/06/xrp-army-drives-bumper-sales-in-ripple-stock-despite-sec-probe,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/98368d5b0a678028753245c17809bf8c5833f62a-4287x2877.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

As the name implies, an inverse ETF is designed to perform as the opposite of whatever index or benchmark it is designed to track.  An ETF that shorts bitcoin (BTC) from Horizons ETFs currently trades on the Toronto Stock Exchange.  ProShares introduced, and won SEC approval for, the first bitcoin futures ETF trading in the U.S., the Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO). The SEC has yet to approve a bitcoin ETF that holds actual bitcoin.  The inverse product, the ProShares Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF, if approved, would also track bitcoin futures.  Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas notes the SEC rejected a similar offering by Direxion last year, but believes this ProShares product has a shot given ProShares’ track record in getting BITO approved.

The survey, conducted by Wakefield Research, showed that as of March 27 just four of the 100 cryptocurrency investors polled had filed their tax returns, according to a press release. The survey found that 74% were looking for more help from their exchanges on how to manage their crypto taxes.  With the April 18 U.S. tax filing deadline approaching, the data suggests many investors lack knowledge on how to prepare their crypto-specific tax returns. Many don’t know what constitutes a taxable event, the survey showed. As many as 40% of participants did not know that selling crypto was subject to taxation, with 48% unaware that sales of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) fell into this category.  It is “not surprising that the vast majority of cryptocurrency users are unprepared to file their taxes” because the subject is so complex, CoinTracker Chief Operating Officer Vera Tzoneva said in an email.  Holders of digital assets have to pay taxes when selling crypto or NFTs for profit, gifting crypto over $15,000, using crypto to pay for goods and services, or trading one token for another. Holding crypto for less than a year before selling makes investors susceptible to short-term capital gains taxes, whereas keeping it for over a year before a sale is considered long term and different rates apply.  CoinTracker, a digital asset portfolio manager that allows investors to view their crypto holdings across different exchanges and wallets, said it aims to use the survey to develop programs to educate users and better prepare them for filing taxes, according to the press release.  “We work in tandem with our partners to write concise and accurate tax-related content to be published on our partners’ platforms and serve their communities,” said Tzoneva, who joined the company in September from Google. “We have also partnered with various platforms to offer continuous professional education (CPE) courses for CPAs focused on crypto taxation.”  After a $100 million funding round in January, CoinTracker has formed partnerships with Coinbase, OpenSea, Intuit's TurboTax, Phantom and Blockchain.com to aid users in tax payments, according to a press release.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | SPONSORED | RESEARCH,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/04/06/cointracker-survey-shows-only-25-of-crypto-holders-are-prepared-for-tax-season,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/db2be441eccb244430363cd930e0447cb1f53d88-2047x1210.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411831,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glgDpn,1649254334,Decentraland for Beginners: How to Get Started in Decentraland,"If you’re looking to visit Decentraland for the first time, the first thing you’ll need to do is navigate to the official website and click ""Start Exploring"" in the top right-hand corner. Connect a crypto wallet that you already own, or just enter as a guest.  You will need to do this on a desktop, as Decentraland is not yet supported on mobile devices.  Avatar creation  Now comes your first chance to get creative and relive your childhood on Sims by constructing an image of a human to serve as your avatar: your personal emissary in the virtual world.  When you eventually get bored of mixing and matching mustaches and tiaras (you can and should give your character an eye patch), you just have to pick a name and you’re good to go.  Remember, you can always change your appearance inside the game by going to the start menu and looking in your backpack. So don’t worry about your shoe color too much.  You will start in the Genesis Plaza – a kind of town square. You will be surrounded straightaway by other people’s avatars, but don’t panic. A floating mentor named Alice will jump in and start offering you advice on how best to begin your journey through the virtual world.  Keyboard controls in Decentraland  The system is very familiar to most computer-based games:  Direct your gaze using the mouse.  Move around using the arrows or W-A-S-D keys.  Press V to switch between first and third-person views.  Space to jump.  If you are not familiar, or you forget any controls, just press C to bring up a reminder of them.  You can start talking to other users through the chat function, or by pressing T and talking into your microphone.  Now you have an avatar to do your bidding in Decentraland and you’re ready to start making waves.  But what waves should you make? And how? Here are some tips to keep you going.  What to do in Decentraland  The two central elements of Decentraland are LAND and MANA. LAND is the name of the non-fungible asset associated with the virtual space in the environment you are now exploring.  When you buy a ""parcel"" of LAND, you acquire a specific bit of the virtual environment. It has coordinates to identify it. You can take your avatar there. You can build virtual things on it. You can link it up with other users’ parcels to create ""districts"" and collaboratively create structures or experiences. In theory, the value of the parcels should go up as more users join the platform: The number of parcels is fixed at 90,000.  How do you buy LAND?  Purchasing LAND on Decentraland requires MANA – the native cryptocurrency of Decentraland.  The general idea is to acquire MANA through various means and then go to the marketplace and use your MANA to buy things.  The easiest way to get MANA is to buy it. Go to your profile, click the plus symbol, and you can either buy MANA using traditional currency or by swapping another cryptocurrency for it.  You’ll find you can buy MANA on the Ethereum or the Polygon blockchain – which is simpler than it sounds. Decentraland was built on Ethereum, but it has been integrating with the Polygon chain because of major potential savings on transaction costs. You can move any MANA from Ethereum to Polygon at any time.  The next easiest way to get MANA is through play-to-earn games. There are casinos within the virtual Decentraland environment as well as mini-games. There are even quests, too. If you don’t want to sink any of your money into Decentraland, you can invest your time instead.  Perhaps the most difficult way to earn MANA is by seriously working for it. If you have the right skill set, you can offer your services to other users in return for a wage paid in MANA. Or you can design assets to sell in the marketplace yourself, although you do need to put down a small amount of MANA in the first place to be able to do that.  Buy and sell items in the Decentraland marketplace  Once you have some MANA, you’ll need to go to the official Decentraland marketplace. Here you can buy LAND.  If you’ve heard of people making money through Decentraland, this is probably how they did it: by flipping parcels of LAND. If you’re clever and/or lucky, you’ll get hold of parcels of land that are in favorable locations and become increasingly more valuable over time. If you’re successful, you can sell up, lock in a profit and try to repeat the process again.  It’s not only LAND that you can buy in the marketplace. There is all manner of collectibles on offer too, all hitched to non-fungible tokens (NFTs). These are endlessly tradable, just like the LAND. That means potential profit – but only if you select desirable ones.  You can access the map through the start menu (top right corner) at any time, and you can click anywhere to teleport there instantly. There are nine plazas in total. The center of the Genesis Plaza has coordinates 0,0 and every other location is defined in relation to that.  You’ll see all kinds of things on the map such as ""Dinosaur Hunt,"" ""Fantasy World of Endless Time"" and ""Crypto Valley Art Gallery."" Go explore!

The payments company is notifying some 8.2 million current and former customers about the breach, according to a regulatory filing.  The employee had regular access to the reports as part of their job, but the Dec. 10 access occurred after their employment had ended.  Block said the reports included the customers’ full name and unique brokerage account. Some customers had more data in the report, including portfolio value, holdings and one day’s trading activity.  The reports did not include usernames, passwords, Social Security numbers, birth dates, payment card or bank account information, addresses or other personally identifiable information.  Block, whose CEO is Jack Dorsey, said the reports also didn’t include security codes, access codes or passwords for Cash App Investing accounts.  The company notified the applicable regulatory authorities and law enforcement about the breach.  Block hasn’t completed its investigation into the incident, but doesn’t expect it to impact its operations or financial results.  “The company takes the security of information belonging to its customers very seriously and continues to review and strengthen administrative and technical safeguards to protect the information of its customers,” Block said in the filing.

Sign up here to get it in your inbox each weekday morning.  Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market Moves: Bitcoin drops as bond yields continue to rise. Technical charts signal more losses ahead. Luna Foundation Guard returned to the bitcoin market with a bang.  Featured Story: Metaverse platforms struggle as user base falls short of market expectations.  And check out the CoinDesk TV show “First Mover,” hosted by Christine Lee, Emily Parker and Lawrence Lewitinn at 9:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern time.  Damanick Dantes, markets reporter, CoinDesk  Scott Freeman, partner and co-founder, JST Capital  James Czerniawski, senior tech and innovation policy analyst, Americans for Prosperity  Bilal Hafeez, founder and CEO, Macro Hive  Market Moves  By Omkar Godbole  It's dip buyers versus an adverse macroeconomic situation in the crypto market today.  As for dip buyers, after a brief hiatus, Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) – a nonprofit organization mandated to build reserves to support smart contract blockchain Terra's dollar-pegged stablecoin UST – returned to the bitcoin market with a bang.  The foundation snapped up more than 5,000 BTC worth $230 million early Wednesday. That's more than software company MicroStrategy's purchases of 4,167 BTC between Feb. 15 and April 4.  Still, bitcoin traded weak as the uptick in the U.S. government bond yields triggered a renewed aversion to risky assets. MicroStrategy bought bitcoin on price dips in the final quarter of 2021, but that didn't stop or slow down cryptocurrency's bearish trend at the time as it nosedived from $68,000 to $32,000 in three months to late February, predominantly on fears of a more hawkish Federal Reserve.  Crypto Twitter is optimistic that LFG's continued purchases to build a $10 billion bitcoin reserve eventually will help the cryptocurrency decouple from traditional markets this time around. That belief perhaps stems from LFG buying bitcoin in large quantities compared with MicroStrategy's purchases. Only time will tell if LFG saves bitcoin from the macro conditions.  According to some observers, bitcoin's next leg higher would resume once the real or inflation-adjusted yields stop rising. The U.S. 10-year real yield has risen by more than 60 basis points in four weeks to hit a two-year high.  The Fed is scheduled to release the minutes of its March policy meeting on Wednesday. The CME Group's FedWatch Tool points to a greater than 70% probability of a 50 basis points rate hike in May. The central bank raised rates by a quarter percentage point last month.  ""Now risk aversion is gradually rising, and the dollar index has reached its year-to-date highest level,"" Griffin Ardern, a volatility trader from crypto-asset management company Blofin, said. ""The liquidity contraction may be accelerating. At 2 p.m. ET, details of the March FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) meeting will be announced.""  FXStreet editor and analyst Eren Sengezer noted that ""in case the minutes show that policymakers considered a bigger rate increase but ended up voting for a 25 bps one to avoid a big market reaction, U.S. Treasury bond yields could continue to rise and provide a boost to the dollar. Market participants will also pay close attention to details surrounding the Fed’s plan to shrink the balance sheet.""  The hourly chart (above left) shows that bitcoin has dived out of a narrowing price range.  The daily chart's relative strength index has breached the ascending trendline and the MACD (moving average divergence convergence) histogram has crossed into bearish territory under zero. As a result, support at $41,780 identified by the 50-day average stands exposed. On the higher side, the 200-day average at $48,266 is the level to beat for the bulls.

Tokens for the three major metaverse protocols – Decentraland, Axie Infinity and The Sandbox – are all down year-to-date and underperforming bitcoin by a big margin.  While all three have seen significant interest from venture capitalists who have allocated hundreds of millions to the metaverse and GameFi sectors, some market observers say the number of daily active users (DAU) don't reflect that level of investment.  “There is currently no organic engagement that retains players in the game – unlike traditional games like Fortnite, GTA, Candy Crush – where players are willing to pay to keep playing,” Web 3 analyst DeFi Vader wrote in a note last August about Axie Infinity. “If one or a few of those games create organic engagement, then DAU growth may stop being mostly dependent on daily earnings.”  Read The Full Story Here: Metaverse Majors Struggle as User Base Falls Short of Market Expectations  Today’s newsletter was edited by Omkar Godbole and produced by Parikshit Mishra and Stephen Alpher.",NEUTRAL,BTC,AXS | BTC | MANA | MARKET | TRADING,"Omkar Godbole, Parikshit Mishra, Sam Reynolds",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/04/06/first-mover-americas-bitcoin-dip-buyers-versus-adverse-macro-fed-minutes-eyed,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/15b525d4906cd3018bb84ab6a21f187bd90e4734-4256x2836.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42395667,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASyOHM,1649251139,Kevin Smith to Issue ‘Comedy-Horror’ Film as NFTs on Secret Network,"Kevin Smith, the filmmaker responsible for cult classics like “Clerks,” “Chasing Amy” and “Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back,” announced Wednesday that he will be releasing his latest movie, “KillRoy Was Here,” as a collection of non-fungible tokens (NFTs).  Smith is tapping the Cosmos blockchain-based Secret Network for the launch, the same network that hosted Quentin Tarantino’s controversial ”Pulp Fiction” NFTs in November. While NFT plans for “KillRoy” have been discussed for about a year, its details are just now coming to light. A release date is slated for some time in the second quarter.  As with the Tarantino collection, Smith’s collectibles will rely on Secret Network’s “secret” sauce: That is making the content of the tokens, which includes the “comedy-horror” film itself along with bonus behind-the-scenes footage, viewable only to NFT holders.  “Everyone, especially people with fame, are using NFTs as a new way to make money,” Smith told CoinDesk in an interview. “But to me, it's a whole new creative playground. It reminds me of the YouTube revolution, where kids were able to create stuff in a whole new way. I missed it then, but I won’t miss it again.”  Each NFT in the collection of 5,555 will come with its own generative artwork, each a different twist on the film’s main character. Smith’s plan is for holders to use the characters to create content of their own and then feature the best creations as the film’s sequel.  Kevin Smith NFTs  Smith's personal interest in NFTs dates back to last April, when he made his NFT debut with “Smokin’ Tokens,” a collection based on his beloved “Jay and Silent Bob” characters. He said playing around with the new medium reminds him a lot of the indie film scene in the 1990s, which was defined by creativity and experimentation.  “My dream is for 'KillRoy' to be its own self-thriving franchise within the world of crypto and NFTs, without ever having to step outside of the blockchain,” Smith told CoinDesk.  Unlike how Tarantino's drop occurred, Secret Network will release the collection through Legendao, an NFT launchpad involving partners Semkhor and Curio.  While the non-fungible film market has actually been burgeoning in recent months, Secret Network’s unique model has yet to be recreated by competitors, which have used NFTs mainly for funding or token-gated access to content, not embedding the content in the NFTs themselves.  “I’ll put it very bluntly, I don't understand what the point of token-gating is,” Guy Zyskind, founder of Secret Network, told CoinDesk in an interview. “That’s pay-per-view, not NFTs. At the end of the day, if your NFT is just access to some centralized server, why not just do a login and password?”  At some point after the collection’s launch, Smith and Secret Network plan to distribute the film more widely, though no details have been decided on.

The new signatories – including crypto analytics firms Chainalysis, TRM and Elliptic, as well as exchanges like Gemini, Robinhood Markets, Nexo and Bitpanda – join CMIC’s 17 original members, including Coinbase, BitMEX and Solidus Labs (the founding member of the organization), bringing the total number of signatories to 30.  “We’re excited about the prominent players in this industry coming forward to join us and amplify how important market integrity is,” Kathy Kraninger, vice president of regulatory affairs at Solidus Labs, told CoinDesk. Before coming to Solidus Labs, Kraninger worked in government, most notably as the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.  To join CMIC, signatories must sign a pledge and publicly commit to ensuring market integrity and market efficiency and to preventing market abuses like fraud and manipulation. Kraninger told CoinDesk that education and training of member organizations is also a key component of CMIC’s mission.  CMIC is a proto-self regulatory organization (SRO) – what Kraninger sees as a “recognized first step” toward a potential future in which the industry can self-regulate.  CMIC isn’t the first organization to tout self-regulation. In 2018, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, the founders of Gemini, backed a short-lived aspiring SRO, the Virtual Commodity Association, that failed to get off the ground.  Galaxy Digital has backed the Association for Digital Market Assets (ADAM), another similar organization. Meanwhile, the Global Digital Asset and Cryptocurrency Association has about 40 member companies, including some white-shoe law firms and crypto companies like BitStamp and CrossTower.  Though many in the crypto community have touted self-regulation as the solution to the industry’s woes, potential SROs and SRO-like organizations like CMIC have failed to gain any real traction with regulators.  But if self-regulation is a possibility down the line, Kraninger says now as the time to gather industry participants from across the world to gather the best ideas for regulation.  “Regulators are comparing notes. That’s one benefit of being a global community, they are comparing notes,” Kraninger said. “That doesn’t mean the laws are going to be the same, but there is certainly some sharing and a lot of coordination by law enforcement that continues to grow.  “We as an industry should be coordinating and speaking with one voice as well,” she said.

Investors in the seed round were a mix of early stage venture capitalists and crypto-native firms, including RRE Ventures, Foundation Capital, Original Capital, VanEck and Circle Ventures, among others.  “Binance.US intends to go public in the next two to three years at a time that we deem is right for the business,” a company spokesperson told CoinDesk via email.  Launched in 2019, the exchange offers more than 85 tokens and 190 trading pairs for retail and institutional traders.  According to a press release, Binance.US will use the new capital to enhance its spot trading platform, develop of a new suite of products and fund marketing and education initiatives.  In November, Changpeng Zhao, the founder of the exchange’s parent company, said Binance.US was raising a “couple hundred million” in a funding round that would “close in about a month or two.”  The valuation for Binance.US is smaller than some of its local rivals. Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX.US was valued at $8 billion in a $400 million funding round in January.

42395679,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASyOQD,1649250000,Crypto Trading Firm Wintermute Launches Zero-Fee OTC Platform,"Wintermute, a cryptocurrency market maker, is launching an over-the-counter (OTC) trading platform targeting institutional investors.  The new platform, Wintermute Node, is intended to be a one-stop shop providing price discovery, trading and exposure monitoring of digital assets. The single-dealer platform will charge zero fees and allow clients to directly access Wintermute’s liquidity over API and web interface.  Wintermute Node appears to be competing against the bevy of other institutional trading platforms on the market for access to crypto order flow – including FalconX and Coinbase Prime.  “The others are charging a lot,” Wintermute founder and CEO Evgeny Gaevoy told CoinDesk in an interview. “Our platform eliminates an extra layer of fees.”  While the new platform will not charge any fees, all of the orders placed through Node will be executed by Wintermute, giving the firm access to a greater volume of order flow. Users will be shown a bid-ask spread with prices that are identical to the spreads the firm shows to its counterparties across other venues, the firm told CoinDesk.  Crypto market makers, like their counterparts in traditional financial markets, quote buy and sell prices for token pairs and profit by pocketing the spread.  “We can also do more on the structured products side,” added Gaevoy, who rose to head the exchange-traded fund (ETF) business at market making firm Optiver before launching Wintermute.  The new Node API expands on Wintermute’s existing OTC API, which first launched in June 2021.  Trading volumes surge  Founded in 2017, Wintermute has grown to become one of the largest and most active crypto market participants. According to a press release, the firm currently trades in over 60 centralized and decentralized trading venues.  “We’re connected to the most liquidity sources – that’s the main thing differentiating us,” said Gaevoy, who added that Wintermute is active in making markets for over 250 tokens.  Most recently, Wintermute was one of two market makers retained by Yuga Labs – the company behind the non-fungible token (NFT) collection Bored Ape Yacht Club – to jump-start trading for its ApeCoin token.  Since inception, Wintermute has done nearly $2 trillion in cumulative trading volume, with over 90% of that figure traded since 2021. The firm says it trades over $5 billion in volume daily.  “If you are a person or an entity active on exchanges, aggregators, brokers or borrowing-lending platforms, there is a good chance your transactions are actually executed by Wintermute,” said Gaevoy in a statement.  Vertical integration  With its new platform, Wintermute also appears to be vertically integrating its business model by building a direct pipeline to big crypto buyers and their order flow.  Wintermute has also been more active in the venture capital front, participating in over 40 seed and series A investments last year. Some of their investments include Aave, dYdX, Polygon and Paraswap.  The move follows in the footsteps of Jump Crypto and Alameda Research, other influential crypto market makers and perhaps two of Wintermute’s largest competitors in the space. Jump and Alameda both built up their trading businesses before expanding to venture capital and beyond.  “We want to cover more of the ecosystem,"" said Gaevoy. ""The more counterparties we have, the more efficient we can be.”  Read more: Jump Crypto Wants You to Know Its Name  Institutional investors are increasingly prioritizing execution quality and minimizing fees, signaling the slow-but-sure maturation of crypto markets.  “Retail is not as sensitive when it comes to execution quality, but when you talk to funds or whales, they do care,” Gaevoy told CoinDesk.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | SPONSORED | TRADING,Tracy Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/04/06/crypto-trading-firm-wintermute-launches-zero-fee-otc-platform,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5f407f2c53761305fa4380b710a2dba8738e739e-6048x4024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The price of the NEAR token started inching up on the news, trading at $15.82 as of press time.  Crypto-native investors in the new round included Republic Capital, FTX Ventures, Hashed and Dragonfly Capital, among others.  New York-based Tiger Global had $86 billion in assets under management at the end of last year and has a growing footprint in crypto investments, having backed funding rounds for blockchain infrastructure platform Blockdaemon, crypto exchange FTX, payment processor Moonpay and blockchain intelligence provider TRM Labs, among others.  Since its October 2020 mainnet launch, Near has focused on creating a user-friendly platform for developers of decentralized applications (dapps). The speedy proof-of-stake blockchain is meant to serve as an alternative to Ethereum, which has scalability issues that can cause transaction fees to spike.  The increasingly cash-rich Near ecosystem has benefited projects building on the blockchain. Last October, Near’s Aurora raised $12 million to bring Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility to the network.

42395671,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASyOKJ,1649244959,Sweden Wants to Test E-Krona Viability for Smart Payments,"The Swedish central bank says it wants to look at how a new e-krona could stimulate ""smart payments"" that some say are the future of money.  In a report published on Wednesday, the Riksbank deemed tests to integrate state-backed digital money into conventional banking systems a success – but said it was still examining claims of the promised benefits the new technology could bring.  The ability to program or control transfers – such as triggering a payment when a contract is fulfilled, or giving pocket money that can not be spent on sweets – are cited as a potential benefit of central bank digital currency (CBDC), but Swedish officials want to probe that further.  “Concepts such as programmable money, smart money and smart payments are often said to be the future of payments, and this is used as an argument in favor of the new technology,” the central bank said in the report.  Though no decision has yet been taken about the design or issuance of an e-krona, in the next phase, “we want to test and explore how such solutions can be used to create new payment services, and why they would be more effective than more traditional technologies,” the central bank said.  A trial to integrate existing intermediaries such as banks to distribute the CBDCs to regular citizens was deemed “successful” by the report, as were off-line solutions in which the asset can be stored locally on someone’s phone.  Like the European Central Bank (ECB), Sweden, which is in the European Union but does not use the euro currency, is looking at whether to allow those offline payments – which could aid privacy, but also bring the same kinds of risks of cash, like theft, or use of the funds for illicit purposes.  Because the pilot version of the e-krona verifies tokens using a transaction history, more data gets shared among participants than would normally be the case, meaning the idea could fall foul of tough privacy laws, such as the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).  “Consultation with both the Swedish and the European Data Protection Authorities may be necessary to clarify how a solution based on DLT/block chain technology relates to data protection regulations,"" the report said.  That relates to an ongoing debate on whether crypto-style blockchain technology would aid or hinder user confidentiality.  Blockchain “might ultimately be the only solution left, in terms of being able to embed privacy by design” into a potential new digital euro, Marina Niforos, fffiliate professor at HEC Paris, told CoinDesk. Cryptographic mechanisms are potentially able to ensure that data is only accessed by those who need to see it, she added.  But the Bank for International Settlement’s Hyun Song Shin warned in a webinar on Wednesday that blockchain could also lead to a free-for-all of payment data being made public.  In systems that use people’s real names, “we cannot use blockchains as in cryptocurrencies, because we don't want to post all the transactions in a public way, so that everyone can see what transaction someone has made with whomever,"" Shin said.

LFG purchased 5,040 BTC, boosting its stash to 35,768 BTC valued at $1.6 billion at the current market price of $45,100, the foundation's confirmed bitcoin address shows.  That's the first significant purchase since March 30. The foundation acquired about $125 million worth of bitcoin each day, starting from March 22 to March 25 and allocated $160 million on March 26.  LFG announced in February that it had raised $1 billion through an over-the-counter sale to build a bitcoin reserve as an additional layer of security for UST.  The reserve size was increased to $3 billion last month, with Terraform Labs founder and CEO Do Kwon tweeting plans to eventually build a $10 billion bitcoin stash.  The foundation's buying spree has put it ahead of the U.S. electric car maker Tesla (TSLA), which holds $1.26 billion worth of BTC on its balance sheet.  The latest purchase comes as macro jitters weigh over bitcoin, offering the foundation an opportunity to load up at cheap prices.  Read More: What Is LUNA and UST?

Venture capital firm a16z, Dialectic, Paradigm and Accel also participated in the round. The funds from the new round as well as Sky Mavis and Axie Infinity's balance sheets will ensure affected users are reimbursed, the gaming firm said.  On March 23, validator nodes on Sky Mavis’ Ronin network and on Axie decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) were compromised, Sky Mavis said. The attacker used hacked private keys in order to forge fake withdrawals from the Ronin bridge across two transactions and was able to drain a total of 173,600 ether (ETH) and 25.5 million USDC.  The Ronin attacker had pulled off the exploit by obtaining five of the nine validator keys that are responsible for securing the Ronin network. By holding a majority of the keys, the attacker was able to maliciously withdraw piles of cryptocurrency straight from the Ronin Bridge into a rogue Ethereum wallet.  ""We strongly believe Sky Mavis will bring a lot of value and growth for the larger industry and we believe it’s necessary to support them as they work hard to resolve the recent incident,"" Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said.  Binance also said on Wednesday that it has fully resumed deposits and withdrawals on the Ronin network after closing then partially resuming the service last week.  The attacker behind one of the biggest crypto hacks to date, had apparently moved 2000 ether to privacy tool Tornado Cash earlier this week.

However, Cardano was once in the top 5 cryptocurrencies both in terms of trading volumes and growth prospects. Maybe it had a second breath? https://www.tradingview.com/x/nU1LbNlu/ In our previous analysis, we wrote that we expect a test of $1.4. Buyers managed to realize our main scenario. After breaking the local wedge, which sellers have formed since January 2021, the ADA price quickly jumped by 60%. At the same time, trading volumes remained low. In order not to give the initiative to sellers, for buyers at any cost it is necessary to keep control over a mark of $1.1. Keeping this mark, buyers will organize a narrow consolidation range of $1.1-$1.14, which will accumulate positions to break the consolidation up. With such a positive scenario, the next target for the ADA price increase is $2. Loss of customer control over the $1.1 mark will lead to a new fall wave with the first target of $0.9. This mark will make it clear how strong sellers are and whether they will be able to continue falling to $0.7.

Tokens for the three major metaverse protocols, Decentraland's MANA, Axie Infinity's AXS and The Sandbox's SAND are all down year to date, and significantly underperforming bitcoin (BTC).  While all three have seen significant interest from venture capitalists, who have allocated hundreds of millions to metaverse and GameFi, some market observers say the number of daily active users (DAU) doesn't reflect the level of investment.  “There is currently no organic engagement that retains players in the game – unlike traditional games like Fortnite, GTA, Candy Crush – where players are willing to pay to keep playing,” Web 3 analyst DeFi Vader wrote in an August note about Axie Infinity. “If one or a few of those games create organic engagement, then DAU growth may stop being mostly dependent on daily earnings.”  In the past 30 days, the number of Axie Infinity's average daily users has dropped 30% from the previous period to about 107,240, The Sandbox's has fallen 29% to 1,180 and Decentraland has lost 15% to 978 users a day on average, according to DappRadar data.  When compared to mainstream games on Steam – a digital gaming store – these numbers barely even register against titles like Counter Strike, Dota 2, and PUBG.  For Axie Infinity, it’s impossible to determine how many of these players are there just for fun, rather than as employees of guilds playing the game to earn yield for investors. The team behind Axie Infinity seems to understand this, and acknowledges that gameplay needs to improve for the game to grow organically.  Gamers, themselves, appear to be hostile to GameFi. Gaming giant Ubisoft’s non-fungible token (NFT) efforts fell flat and an industry survey published during the Game Developers Conference showed that most studios are not interested in embracing crypto or NFTs.  It’s likely the wider industry sees the monetization of game play as unattractive to would-be participants, explains Messari in a research note, asking rhetorically if the reader has ever met anyone that finds these games fun.  “First, the ability to purchase NFTs or in-game currency effectively creates pay-to-win game mechanics, a quality that most major franchises and successful games avoid,” Messari’s Mason Nystrom wrote in a March report. “The most successful games often share an element of skill, opting to create a competitive multiplayer gaming experience and avoiding a 'spam the credit card until you win' option.”  Still, there are those in the industry who say quality gameplay can go hand in hand with GameFi and the metaverse. In an interview with CoinDesk earlier this year, Red Door Digital’s See Wan Toong sees the crypto funding model as a way to ween games off reliance on being bankrolled by major studios.  The question remains whether this view will become mainstream.

This is probably the opinion of XMR buyers, shaping the local growth trend. However, is this really good, given the current situation in the cryptocurrency market? During the trading month on the XMR market, the price rose by 23%. Quite passive growth, given its dynamics during the weekly candle of 7 March. Interestingly, with each passing XMR trading week, the trading volumes are declining. However, even under such conditions, buyers manage to push the price up to the target of $280. In the last two trading weeks, buyers have had problems near the local mark of $220. As we can see in the chart, the price for 2 weeks is at the gates of this mark. Stopping the price near the local mark signals to us the weakness of buyers and lack of strength to continue growth without correction. Therefore, in the event of an unsuccessful attempt to break the $220 mark during the trading week of 4 April, we will expect a local price reduction. The main target for maintaining growth dynamics is $190. Buyers have repeatedly kept the price near this mark since June 2021. In the case of the beginning of the local correction, it is best to buy low-risk XMR near the $190 mark. However, it is not a fact that such a correction will take place, and that is why.

42395676,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASyORC,1649236355,Observers Cautious for Bitcoin as US Inflation-Adjusted Bond Yield Hits 2-Year High,"Just when you think the crypto-native developments have put the market on solid footing, macro factors threaten to make the ground shaky again.  Specifically, the surging inflation-adjusted and nominal government bond yields in the U.S. and worldwide could complicate matters for risk assets, including bitcoin (BTC) and traditional store of value assets like gold.  According to the St. Louis Bank of Federal Reserve, the U.S. 10-year real or inflation-adjusted Treasury yield has risen to -0.38% this week, the highest since early June 2020. While the yield remains negative, it has seen a near-90 degree rise of 66 basis points in four weeks.  ""Another big leg up for gold and bitcoin will likely occur when real yields stop rising. We are not there yet,"" Jeroen Blokland, founder and research head at investment research platform True Insights, tweeted.  Kaiko Research's weekly newsletter, published Monday said, ""Typically, rising borrowing costs hurt risk assets such as tech stocks and crypto, which appear less attractive to investors than safe-haven bonds.""  Bitcoin means many things to many people. For crypto believers, bitcoin is a digital version of gold and an alternative to the U.S. dollar, a global reserve currency. However, traditional market investors largely treat it as a risk-on asset similar to stocks. That's evident from its strengthening correlation with the S&P 500 and technology stocks.  The chart above shows a lack of consistent correlation between bitcoin and the real yield. However, bitcoin's November peak coincided with a bottom in the 10-year real yield. Perhaps macro traders, who accumulated bitcoin as a store of value asset in the aftermath of the coronavirus-induced crash of March 2020, trimmed exposure, tracking the uptick in the real yield, as one observer warned last year.  Hawkish Federal Reserve expectations and a continued rise in the nominal 10-year yield have led to a sharp increase in the real yield.  The nominal yield stood at a three-year high of 2.6% at press time, accounting for a 40 basis point rise since the Fed raised rates on March 16, according to the charting platform TradingView. The yield is up more than 100 basis points on a year-to-date basis and the rally is becoming a source of worry for observers.  ""The rise in the 10-year Treasury yield is continuing in Asian trading. There've been plenty of bond market false alarms over the years, but this is beginning to look a lot like the long-feared breakout,"" John Authers, Bloomberg's senior editor for markets, tweeted.  When asked what level on the 10-year yield could start becoming a headache for risk assets, Authers replied, ""Around about now, if not a while ago. ...""  Asian stocks traded lower at press time alongside losses in the European equity futures, per Investing.com. On Tuesday, U.S. stocks fell more than 1% and the rally in yields picked up the pace after Fed Governor Lael Brainard said the central bank could resort to a rapid balance sheet runoff to bring U.S. monetary policy to a ""more neutral position"" later this year.  Bitcoin changed hands near $45,500 as of writing, according to CoinDesk data. Accumulation by Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) and an uptick in stock markets perhaps overshadowed the rising real yield and helped the cryptocurrency carve out gains following the mid-March rate hike. LFG's confirmed bitcoin address shows the accumulation has slowed this month, making bitcoin vulnerable to adverse macro developments.  ""Now risk aversion is gradually rising, and the dollar index has reached its year-to-date highest level,"" Griffin Ardern, a volatility trader from crypto-asset management company Blofin, said. ""The liquidity contraction may be accelerating.

South Korea is one of them. The nation has always been a leading force and major participant in the emerging digital asset economy. Even though South Korea operates in an isolated manner because of its strict capital control laws, its crypto market still grew to new heights, reaching a valuation of $46 billion at the end of 2021. According to a report, South Korea is home to roughly 5.58 million crypto users, accounting for more than 10% of the country&apos;s population. It is impressive how South Korea&apos;s crypto market continued to grow and advance in crypto development despite the fact that the government had imposed crypto license regulation that forced over 60 Korean exchanges to shut down and caused a dent of almost $2.8 billion to traders. South Koreans Have Always Been Early To Emerging Technologies In most countries, the younger demographic tends to explore digital assets like crypto while the older age groups shy away from high-risk asset classes. However, in South Korea, a wide range of age groups actively participate in the market. According to a survey in 2021, it is reported that nearly half the users on top Korean exchanges were in their 40s and 50s.

Will sellers retain control to reach $3? Key technical points: XTZ prices have decreased by 6.57% in the past 24 hours. In addition, the price action shows lower price rejection from the 50-day EMA. Finally, the 24-hour trading volume of Tezos is $116 Million, marking a negligible fall.

The fall came amid a global sell-off driven by hawkish comments from the U.S. Federal Reserve. Fed Governor Lael Brainard said curbing inflation was “paramount,” hinting at trimming the central bank’s balance sheet in May. This led to a sell-off in the market as investors feared a restrictive environment could lead to an economic downturn.  The S&P 500 ended 1.26% lower on Tuesday, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq dropped 2.26%. The downturn spread to Asia Wednesday morning, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 falling 1.48% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng dropping 1.15%  Weakness in the top cryptocurrency led to a broader fall in the crypto market. In the past 24 hours, ether (ETH), Solana’s SOL, and XRP fell 5%, while Avalanche’s AVAX and Polkadot’s DOT fell over 6%. Dogecoin’s DOGE was the only gainer among majors, buoyed by optimism around Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk’s appointment to the board of social media platform Twitter (TWTR), which is being viewed as a positive sign for the meme coin.  Bitcoin’s slump comes a week after the asset touched three-month highs of $48,000. It fell to $44,500 – a level that has seen buying activity – for the second time this week, breaking through which could see a drop to $43,000.  Bitcoin inflows rise  Buying activity on bitcoin continued to rise on institutional demand even as price action remained volatile over the past few weeks, analytics firm Glassnode pointed out in a note this week.  “Inflows into [wrapped bitcoin], Canadian [exchange-traded funds] and general investor accumulation on-chain has been historically strong, especially following the local price lows set on [Jan. 22],” the note read.  Data shows crypto exchanges saw significant cryptocurrency outflows, with the likes of bitcoin seeing outflows of nearly 96,000 bitcoin each month. Such activity signaled “historically strong accumulation” was taking place, Glassnode said.  Over in Canada, bitcoin ETF products continued to see inflows with total holdings increasing by 6,594 bitcoin – over $300 million at current prices – since January 2022, as per Glassnode. Canadian ETFs now hold some 69,052 bitcoin.  ETFs, or exchange-traded funds, are a type of pooled investment security that can be traded on exchanges similar to stocks, but without investors owning the underlying asset. Some said ETF demand came on the back of political tensions in Eastern Europe, such as the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war.  “The growth in the influx is evidence of the growing trust in the capabilities of bitcoin,” said Alexander Mamasidikov, co-founder of digital bank MinePlex, in a Telegram message. “The continuous growth of the Canadian ETF products is evidence of how popular bitcoin ETFs can be and the positive outlook is bound to draw more investors' funds into the digital currency to help maintain price stability or chart a mild growth in the near term.”  Others say bitcoin demand would only continue as legitimate products, such as ETFs, gain further popularity.  “Having an ETF with bitcoin as the underlying asset will definitely boost confidence for investments,” said Claudiu Minea, co-founder of blockchain crowdfunding platform SeedOn, in an email to CoinDesk. “This might have a positive impact on the most skeptical investors, that might have considered cryptocurrencies a poor investment.”  “Many public companies such as MicroStrategy [MSTR] or Tesla already own a considerable bitcoin portfolio, while others are looking into diversifying their portfolio to include cryptocurrencies as well,” Minea added.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/04/06/bitcoin-slumps-to-45k-amid-hawkish-fed-buying-activity-remains-positive,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0dcd06559309fa08e6191f690991fa3a407bdf3a-1000x681.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The strategy aims to capture growth opportunities arising globally from the development of the metaverse ecosystem over the next decade, the bank said in a statement, adding that the “metaverse is expected to become the next iteration of the internet.”  The metaverse is an immersive digital world created by the combination of virtual reality, augmented reality and the internet. In March, HSBC said it became the first global bank to enter The Sandbox metaverse, when it bought a plot of land to engage with sports, e-sports and gaming fans. The total addressable market for the metaverse economy could be as large as $13 trillion by 2030, Citi said in a report last week.

Will bears overtake trend control? Key technical points: BTC prices have decreased by 2.51% in the past 24 hours. In addition, the price struggles to sustain above the 200-day EMA. Finally, the 24-hour trading volume of Bitcoin is $34.59 Billion, marking an 11.45% fall. Past Performance of BTC The demand surge from the support trendline drove the Bitcoin (BTC) prices higher above the $45 resistance zone. The bullish breakout of the $45K resistance demanded the retest resulting in the short-term triangle formation. The retest phase shows a lower price rejection with the long-tail formation near the 200-day EMA.

Blockchain security has become a controversial topic in the crypto space due to the large amount of malicious attacks that have recently taken place. Solutions need to be created that can further advance encryption capabilities. How are blockchains secured? Blockchains are secured via a multitude of different consensus mechanisms, but virtually all, Bitcoin included, share the same underlying security protocol called cryptography. Bitcoin, for example, uses an algorithm known as SHA-256. The SHA stands for secure hashing algorithm and is an example of a common hashing algorithm used in cryptocurrency and for other encryption purposes in operating systems such as Unix and Linux. The algorithm functions such that any input into the algorithm creates an output of 256 digits that are relevant to the data inputted. Therefore if it is provided the same input, the same 256 digits are achieved every time. If any of the data were to be changed, the outcome would be completely different. Another important element is that there is no known, reliably successful method of performing the computation the other way around, meaning that by simply having the 256 bits long output, it is practically impossible to come up with the input.
