42428070,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL5sDh,1510781463,Tezos Founders Hit With Second Class Action Suit,"For the second time in less than three weeks, a lawsuit has been filed against the founders of the Tezos project.  Pursued in the U.S. District Court in Florida, the suit alleges Tezos founders Arthur and Kathleen Breitman deceptively sold unregistered securities in violation of both federal and state law when they raised $232 million in an initial coin offering (ICO) in July.  The filing names the husband-and-wife pair, the Tezos Foundation and Dynamic Ledger Solutions – the Delaware-based company that holds Tezos's intellectual property – as defendants. Further, it accuses them of fraudulently and deceptively marketing the sale of the platform's native token ""Tezzies"" as charitable contributions and then pocketing ""tens of millions of dollars"" for themselves.  ""Notwithstanding the defendants' attempts to avoid governmental and private scrutiny, it is clear that the financiers were indeed profit-seeking investors in a security and that Defendants promoted and conducted an unregistered offering of securities, not a charitable fundraiser,"" the complaint reads.  It continues:  ""[D]ue to the many misrepresentations, factual omissions and unlawful activities engaged in by the defendants – it appears [participants in the ICO] cannot, and potentially will not, see any return on their investments.""  The Breitmans' lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday, but in previous cases they have denied any wrongdoing and have signaled that they will aggressively fight back against such lawsuits.  The news marks the latest development in the ongoing controversy over the project, which broke into the public view earlier this month when the Breitmans accused Johann Gevers, the head of the Tezos Foundation (created to support development of the project), of self-dealing. Gevers, in turn, alleged that the Breitmans were seeking to usurp control of the non-profit foundation.  The new complaint filed by David Silver, a partner at SilverMiller in south Florida, echoes and expands upon allegations laid out in a separate class action suit filed in California on Oct. 25, which came just days after the dispute between the Breitmans and Gevers went public.

42428079,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL5sRh,1510778730,Brokerage Chief: Bitcoin Futures Must Be Quarantined,"A well-known electronic brokerage firm is issuing dire warnings against the CME Group's plan to launch a bitcoin futures contract next month.  But Interactive Brokers, in a comment letter dated Nov. 14, suggested a way to mitigate the risk it sees from such activity: The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), under the auspices of J. Christopher Giancarlo, should sequester systems that handle cryptocurrency derivatives.  ""This letter is to request that the Commission require that any clearing organization that wishes to clear any cryptocurrency or derivative of a cryptocurrency do so in a separate clearing system isolated from other products,"" wrote Thomas Peterffy, chairman of Interactive Brokers.  The open letter, published on the firm's website (and reportedly included in a full-page ad in today's Wall Street Journal), comes on the heels of CME's announcement that it would look to offer cryptocurrency-tied derivatives products. Earlier this week, CME CEO and chairman Terry Duffy indicated that the first product could go live as early as the second week of December.  Yet that outcome would pose a significant danger, Peterffy argued, suggesting that a hypothetical plunge in the price of a particular cryptocurrency could send CME reeling financially.  He went on to write:  ""If the Chicago Mercantile Exchange or any other clearing organization clears a cryptocurrency together with other products, then a large cryptocurrency price move that destabilizes members that clear cryptocurrencies will destabilize the clearing organization itself and its ability to satisfy its fundamental obligation to pay the winners and collect from the losers on the other products in the same clearing pool.""  Doubling down on the argument, Peterffy went on to write that ""a catastrophe in the cryptocurrency market that destabilizes a clearing organization will destabilize the real economy.""  ""The only way to protect clearing organizations and their members (and the financial system as a whole) from the unique risks inherent in clearing cryptocurrencies is to require that they be cleared in a separate clearing system, isolated from other products,"" he concluded.

15989421,http://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/can-i-buy-bitcoin,1510776002,How can I buy a Bitcoin?,"Now that you understand the basics of Bitcoin, the next logical step is to actually get some. But how? This brief guide will teach you all you need to know. At present, Bitcoins are either bought directly from other people through marketplaces, or purchased at a Bitcoin exchange. They can be paid for in a number of ways, from cold, hard cash, to debit and credit cards, to a wire money transfer, and even using other cryptocurrencies. It largely depends on where you live and from whom you’re buying your Bitcoins. How can I buy Bitcoins? Despite the popularity of Bitcoin as the world’s leading cryptocurrency, and the serious discussion of it at many financial centres around the globe, it remains surprisingly difficult to use PayPal or your credit card to purchase Bitcoins, depending on the jurisdiction in which you live. Of course, the reason has less to do with Bitcoin, and more to do with the transaction methods themselves. These sorts of purchases can be easily reversed with nothing more than a telephone call to the card company, or by raising a report with PayPal. When you’re talking about the transfer of Bitcoins, it is difficult to prove that any goods have actually changed hands. This is the reason most private sellers, and almost all Bitcoin exchanges, do not accept credit cards or PayPal for such transfers. That said, the options have recently grown for consumers in certain countries. Where do I keep my Bitcoins? Before you think about buying Bitcoins, you’re going to need to get a Bitcoin wallet. Though ‘wallet’ is the accepted terminology, you’re better off thinking of it as a sort of bank account, specifically for your Bitcoins. As with any such set-up, there are different wallets you can choose from depending on the level of security you require for your funds, with some of the higher-specification wallets attracting a higher fee to initialise and run. Some wallets act like a regular spending or current account, and can be reasonably compared to a regular leather wallet. Other accounts include the sort of encryption and security that would not seem out of place in a major financial centre, or even in the military. There are four main types of Bitcoin wallet: • A software wallet, which remains stored on your computer’s hard drive • A web-based, online wallet • A vault wallet, which protects your Bitcoins by keeping the wallet offline • A multisig (that is, a multiple-signature) wallet, which requires the use of a number of keys in order to protect the account. It is important to note that none of these options is entirely invulnerable to hacking or other forms of online theft, and each has its own downsides as far as security is concerned. How can I buy Bitcoins with a credit or debit card? If you’re based in the United Kingdom, there are three main providers who offer the opportunity to make a Bitcoin purchase with your credit or debit card – Coinbase, CoinCorner and Bittylicious. All three accept 3D secure-enabled debit and credit cards, so long as they are on the MasterCard or Visa networks. How can I buy Bitcoins with cash? This is where face-to-face (FTF) or over-the-counter (OTC) transactions come into play. The easiest way to acquire Bitcoins, provided you live somewhere that allows you do so, is to make a FTF trade with a local Bitcoin seller. It allows you to avoid any potential hassle with the banks and offers a certain amount of anonymity to you as a buyer. It should be stated up-front that you will still need a Bitcoin wallet, and that you should be very wary of a local seller who advises otherwise, or who says that they will set one up for you. Just as you would not trust another person with your bank account details, nor trust them to set one up in your name, you should make sure that the only person with the details of your Bitcoin wallet is you. There are online services, such as LocalBitcoins, where you can arrange your transaction and agree a price before meeting up with the seller. The purpose of this is to ensure that a cost of the trade can be set prior to making the payment. LocalBitcoins also operates an escrow facility (in which the funds are deposited with them to be paid out to the seller, and vice versa – the site essentially acting as a middleman for the trade). This adds a further layer of protection to the trade. Face-to-face is a slight misnomer. It is entirely possible never to meet the seller. If an amount is agreed, you can make a cash transfer from your account into theirs, or you can go to their local bank and make a cash deposit into theirs, and then provide them with a receipt. Once they have this, the seller should deposit the Bitcoins with you, for storage in your Bitcoin wallet. However, genuine face-to-face trades, where you meet the individual concerned, can and do take place, every day. As with any cash transaction involving a person you don’t know, you should have consideration of your own personal security, particularly if you are looking to trade a sizeable amount. First of all, you should always arrange to meet in a busy public place. The flip-side of this, but worth repeating, is that you should never arrange to meet in a private home, no matter how good a deal you’re getting. If the seller tries to give you some reason as to why this has to happen (that his Bitcoin wallet security is set-up in a way that it has to be operated from his home machine, for instance), then politely walk away and find another seller. The potential gains for your Bitcoin portfolio are not worth the attendant risks. In short, you should take all the precautions you would normally expect to take when walking around with a large amount of cash. Now, it’s possible that the seller will not need an actual cash transaction. An online bank transfer might be entirely acceptable to them, but they want you do do it there and then, so they can see the money going over, before they reciprocate with sending you the Bitcoins. Some sellers might even allow you to make a payment via your PayPal account, though most would be understandably reluctant to do so, preferring a non-reversible method of payment, for all the reasons mentioned earlier in this piece. If you hope to pay by PayPal, ensure that you confirm that this is OK with the seller before meeting up, to avoid embarrassment and wasting one another’s time. Depending on the person you are trading with, they might impose a premium of between 5% and 10% on top of the current Bitcoin exchange price, to allow for the convenience and privacy of a face-to-face trade (and to compensate for their time in meeting you to conduct the transfer). Any reputable trader should be willing to set the price before you meet, but many will institute a window of opportunity for whatever deal you strike, not wanting to wait for too long, just in case the value of Bitcoin takes a sudden and dramatic shift. It should go without saying that, if you're meeting someone for a face-to-face Bitcoin sale, you will need some way of accessing your Bitcoin wallet. If this involves bringing along your tablet, smartphone, or laptop, then so be it, but don’t forget the other essential component: a live and active internet connection to be able to confirm the transfer. A word of caution When considering a face-to-face purchase of Bitcoins, you would be well-advised to check that such a trade is legal in your area, before agreeing to meet. There is little reason why it shouldn’t be but, since the laws for such transactions differ from one jurisdiction to the next, it is best to be sure ahead of time. Also, there is a risk you might excite the interest of local law enforcement if you’re exchanging large sums of cash with another person in a public place. While unlikely, and easily explained, there is always the chance that a passing police officer might suspect you of trading in something a bit more illicit that cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Meet-ups Of course, one-to-one trades might not be your cup of tea, and that’s understandable. A popular form of direct trading in Bitcoins is the meet-up group. You can use a website like meetup.com and see if there is such a thing in your local area. The principle is the same as a face-to-face exchange, but in a group setting that allows for a greater feeling of safety among the individual attendees, and also allows you to learn more about the Bitcoin market from other members of the group. Bitcoin ATMs This is a relatively new concept, but Bitcoin ATMs are increasing in both number and availability across the UK. Several vendors have either released, or are experimenting with these machines: BitAccess, Genesis Coin, CoinOutlet, Robocoin and Lamassu to name but a few. The principle is simple – a Bitcoin ATM serves the same function as a face-to-face transaction, only with a machine instead of another human being. You insert your cash into the ATM and then (depending on the vendor) you either receive a paper receipt containing the relevant codes you’ll need to load your new Bitcoins into your wallet, or you receive a QR code that you will be able to scan with your mobile phone. The rate of exchange has been seen to vary wildly with these machines, and many of them add a fee for the convenience of the service, which can be as high as 8% of the transaction cost. Other ways to purchase Bitcoins Consumers in the States who are classed as underbanked (that is, they don’t have sufficient access to the sorts of mainstream products and financial services usually offered by retail banks), can use expresscoin, who have recently emerged to cater to this very market, accepting wire transfers, personal cheques, and money orders to pay for Bitcoins. No such service exists in the UK at this moment in time. What countries can I buy Bitcoins from? Bitcoin is expanding rapidly into many different markets, and it is not only possible, but expected, that a Bitcoin trader will want to buy in one market and sell in another, as the different exchanges offer different rates. With third-party organisations like CoinBase available to assist the transactions, buying Bitcoins from a different country is now easier than ever. While the spread of Bitcoin is hardly universal at this stage, every major financial centre currently operates at least one Bitcoin exchange, and analysts predict that this growth will continue into developing markets. At present, the following countries all have a trade in Bitcoins: Asia: Singapore Australasia: Australia Europe: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Jersey, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Malta, Monaco, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Republic of Ireland, San Marino, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom North America: Canada, United States of America As with any international financial transaction, it is important to make yourself aware of the various laws and conditions that might impact on your transfer, be it your payment to the seller, or your receipt of Bitcoins from them. If in doubt, it may be worth your time speaking to, or hiring, a dedicated Bitcoin broker to make the exchange on your behalf, for a fee. In conclusion Buying Bitcoins is certainly not as easy as many newcomers suspect, although the ways and means by which to do so are increasing and developing all the time. As Bitcoin continues to make its presence felt in the global marketplace, the process of making Bitcoin transactions will become ever more simple, as a way of enticing developing markets, new investors, and new consumers to the currency.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Crypto Daily,http://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/can-i-buy-bitcoin,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/15989421.jpeg

42428087,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL5sjh,1510773321,Fujitsu Eyes Cryptocurrency Trading With Cross-Blockchain Payments Tech,"Japanese IT firm Fujitsu has unveiled a new payments technology designed to facilitate transactions between blockchains.  Announced today, the ""ConnectionChain"" project is aimed at providing a way for two cryptocurrency networks to interoperate. In statements, the company – which is a member of the Hyperledger blockchain consortium and has developed several products based on the technology to date – suggested that rising activity around cryptocurrency exchanges and initial coin offerings (ICOs) is driving demand for such services.  ""Settlement between virtual currencies managed using blockchains, however, requires a reliable application to handle the currency exchange processing at the boundaries between the blockchains, and ensuring transparency in this process has been an ongoing issue,"" the company said.  To that end, Fujitsu is looking at using a dedicated ""cross-chain"" that would encompass information from other blockchains, in addition to a transaction control mechanism for organizing when transactions are timed and executed.  Here's how Fujitsu described the product:  ""Fujitsu Laboratories has now developed an extension of smart contract technology which inter-connects multiple blockchains by recording the series of related transactions on each chain in a dedicated blockchain, or a ""connection-type chain,"" to link to the currency exchange into a single transaction process that can be automatically executed. It has also developed a transaction control technology to synchronize execution timing of the transaction process on each chain.""  In statements, Fujitsu indicated that it could move to commercialize the product as early as next year – though such a move would be contingent on further testing and development, according to the company.  ""Fujitsu Laboratories will continue expanding this technology beyond currency exchange to areas such as high-trust data exchanges between companies and contract automation, while also continuing to conduct trials in a variety of fields, with the goal of commercialization in fiscal 2018 and beyond,"" the firm said.

The Dec. 6 hearing, The Associated Press reports, represents a delay intended to allow for two witnesses to attend the proceedings, a lawyer for Alexander Vinnik said. Vinnik was arrested in July and accused of laundering billions of dollars through BTC-e, which was also targeted by law enforcement officials.  The development represents the latest twist in a story that sparked global headlines in the wake of Vinnik's arrest. U.S. prosecutors had filed charges against both Vinnik and BTC-e, with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) handing down a $110 million fine against the cryptocurrency exchange.  Vinnik has since remained in Greece after local authorities acted on a U.S. arrest warrant. And while a Greek court initially backed the request to extradite him to face charges in the U.S., Vinnik is seeking to be sent to Russia instead.  As a result, both governments are pushing for their respective extradition requests to be granted, putting the decision in the hands of the Greek Supreme Court, as well as the Greek Justice Department.  In statements, Vinnik has declared his innocence in regards to the U.S. charges, though he acknowledged that he worked for BTC-e. BTC-e – which has since relaunched after having its domain seized by law enforcement – has denied any involvement with Vinnik.

Canaccord's fourth-quarter ""Crypto Quarterly,"" published on Nov. 14, provides a broad overview of the cryptocurrency space, the highest-capitalized coins and the trends expected to shape the ecosystem in the months ahead.  On the subject of token sales – or offers of custom cryptocurrencies used to bootstrap new blockchain networks – the company, which reported more than $54 billion in assets under management earlier this month, said that today's comparatively high-risk environment could become more normalized within the next 20 years.  That is, of course, if the overall cryptocurrency market becomes more ubiquitous and major players from the current financial services sector become involved.  Canaccord's analysts wrote:  ""If, over the next [one to two] decades, the coin market evolves to a more mature state such that one day most coins are attached to well-established companies and trade with sufficient liquidity so as to reduce risk, we believe the gap between ICOs and IPOs will look fairly small.

As it stands, there remains no immediate solution to renewing access to those funds – a situation which Parity acknowledged has caused ""distress and anxiety"" within the community. According to the post, there is ""no timeline"" for the release of the locked-up ETH – a move which may require a platform-wide upgrade to restore functionality to the more than 500 affected wallets.  The hack, which saw the ""accidental"" deletion of the code library which supports Parity's multi-signature wallets (those that require multiple keys to issue transactions), was due to an oversight in the wallet code, the blog post states. While the risk was identified on Github back in August, it was misinterpreted by the Parity team, and no action was taken to further secure the wallets.  As for the process of finding a solution, Parity said that it would work on ethereum improvement protocols that might offer a way to bring back access. Following the attack, discussion has been circulating as to whether updating the code to unwind the problem would constitute a ""bail-out"" akin to the DAO controversy from last year.  Regarding the potential release of the locked millions, Parity says it intends to ""follow the will of the community"" in deploying the code fixes.  The team explained:  ""Parity Technologies will handle much of the development work around these proposals and work constructively with the Ethereum Foundation team and the community towards further protocol layer development.""  Going forward, Parity argued that ""more extensive and formal procedures"" are necessary for contract security, which applies not only to Parity, but is relevant to the entire ethereum platform.  Last week's developments impacted as many as 584 wallets, according to Parity's tracker website. Some of these belonged to high-profile startups, including Parity founder Gavin Wood's Polkadot, which had $98 million in ether frozen in the attack.  To prevent any additional problems, Parity said it removed the ability for users to deploy multi-sig wallets ""until we feel we have the correct security and operations procedures in place.""

42400652,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcKJLr,1510752606,You Want Democracy? Try a Hard Fork,"Taylor Pearson is the author of ""The End of Jobs"" and writes about entrepreneurship and blockchain technologies at TaylorPearson.me.  In this opinion piece, Pearson argues that the mere option of forking not only empowers cryptocurrency users when they leave a project, but also when they stay.      Commentators often try to compare the current stage of the cryptocurrency ecosystem to the internet years. But are we in 1990? 1995? 1998?  An equally valid comparison is to ask where we are in democracy years.  The United States, the first modern democracy, ratified the Articles of Confederation in 1781 following the end of the Revolutionary War. They served as the ""operating system"" of the U.S. government until 1788 when they were replaced by the current constitution which sought to remedy problems discovered with the first modern democratic OS.  Cryptocurrency governance systems may be at a stage analogous to the Articles of Confederation era, when the country was trying a new system of governance that seemed promising, but still had major kinks to be worked out.  The questions being asked at that time in American history were not unlike the questions being asked now about bitcoin and cryptocurrency more broadly:  How much and what type of power should each branch of the federal government have? (How much and what type of power should miners, developers and users have?)  How much power should be decentralized and given to states, and how much should they cede to the central government? (Is it better to scale out through layer 2 solutions like the Lightning Network, or scale up through a block size increase?)  There are even questions we still confront today in American politics that bitcoin now faces, too.  What was the founding fathers' vision? (What was Satoshi's vision?)  Should we care about the founding fathers' vision or adjust to our own current needs? (Should we care about Satoshi's vision or adjust to our own current needs?)  An important difference with democracy, however, is that these new forms of crypto-governance bring a different mechanism to wrestle with those questions: forking.  The best revenge  Attempting to explain American democracy to other European aristocrats, Alexis de Tocqueville wrote in 1840 that elections were mini-revolutions. Instead of letting tension build up over decades and end in violent revolution, democracy created a natural release valve in the form of elections. Participants in the network, citizens, were allowed to voice their feelings and hold leaders accountable, at least in some measure.  Forking adds a new dynamic. We are now able to not just vote, but fork the constitution and bootstrap new systems of governance to see which works best.  Forking allows participants to not just voice their concerns, but create a competing network that more closely mirrors their ideals and preferences. Instead of spending resources trying to convince another party of your views, forking makes it increasingly possible for participants to just build what they believe will be a better network.  In the same way the internet enabled permissionless innovation by allowing anyone to create a website without asking permission, forking allows anyone to create their own network without asking permission. It's A/B testing on steroids.  However, one of the things we learned from the controversy over the suspended Segwit2x fork is that the possibility of forking changes how participants in the network use voice.  Empowering expression  In his 1970 treatise, ""Exit, Voice and Loyalty,"" Albert Hirschman argued that members of an organization, be it a business, nation or any other group, have two possible responses when they're unhappy with the governance of the organization.  They can exit (leave the relationship), or they can use voice (try to improve the relationship through communication).  Citizens of a country can respond to political repression by emigrating (exit) or protesting (voice). Employees can choose to quit their unpleasant job (exit), or talk to management to try and improve the situation (voice). Disgruntled customers can opt to shop elsewhere, or they ask for the manager.  Forking makes exit a much more viable option than it has been in the past. In doing so, it changes the role of voice.  An employee at, say, Google who has three other job offers on the table is more likely to stand up to management and advocate for the change she wants to see. Because the job offers make exit less costly, the offers also increase her willingness to use voice.  The increased ability to exit in the cryptocurrency community, and the increase in voice that accompanies it, may look like toxicity and confrontation on the outside. However, it is facilitating the expression and debate of the best ideas, leading to a more meritocratic outcome.  The employee at Google who is able to leave is actually more likely to create meaningful change in the organization than the one who can't leave.  The ability to fork drives adaptation both through the fork (by creating an alternative protocol that can then compete), but also through enabling participants in the network to have more voice.  What we're seeing with bitcoin cash is the former. This group of big-blockers created an alternative protocol that they are now working to build an ecosystem around and convince miners, developers and users to invest in.  What we saw with Segwit2x was the latter. The anti-2x community knew that the proposed fork could create a competing blockchain, but they were confident it would not destroy their blockchain. They weren’t shy about expressing themselves because they were in the same position as an employee who has other job offers on the table.  If 80 percent of Google could walk out the door tomorrow and take all the company's assets with them, you can be sure they'd be a lot more vocal about the changes they wanted to see. You can also be sure that management would be a lot more responsive.  We don't know how these ecosystems will play out, but the possibility of forking, and the increase in voice it facilitates, suggests we may be evolving towards a more meritocratic form of governance.

42400645,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcKJDz,1510749007,Code Name Babylon: Cobalt Is Spinning Off a New Blockchain Subsidiary,"Distributed ledger startup Cobalt believes its technology can have wider applications than it was originally designed for.  Set up to provide a platform for foreign exchange transactions, the startup is now spinning off part of its technology stack in a bid to make its immutable, shared database system more widely accessible to companies looking to innovate with blockchain.  The wholly-owned subsidiary – code-named ""Babylon"" – will provide what Cobalt co-founder Adrian Patten calls an ""immutability server"" designed to log as many as 30 million transactions per second into any number of public or private blockchains. While the server itself doesn't conduct transactions, it uses a one-way algorithm to verify the accuracy of payment instructions before a transaction is completed.  Speaking with CoinDesk at Cobalt's London offices, Patten compared the Babylon technology to a decentralized Fort Knox, stating:  ""The gold is there. People know how much is in there. We don't have to count it every single time we do something, we just need to know it hasn't moved. It's really simple.""  As a result of such simplicity, Patten believes he'll be able to provide services similar to centralized solutions, but for less than 1 cent per transaction. Further, he sees such an offering as useful in ways that exceed Cobalt's original requirements, positioning the spin-off as a way to pursue those ventures without distractions.  For example, while Babylon's first client will be Cobalt itself, the spin-off has already begun to explore use cases with clients outside its parent firm's target area by looking to log geolocation data for self-driving cars.  Swift reimagined  If successful, Babylon believes this log of payments metadata could provide a safer alternative to centralized messaging platforms like Swift and CLS.  In interview, Patten highlighted potentially competing progress being made by such centralized transaction messaging platforms as an example of how moving existing systems to a distributed ledger could bring about more efficiencies in legacy systems.  But he also argued that it will be cheaper and easier for startups like his own to build platforms from the ground up than to migrate decades-old financial infrastructures to a blockchain.  Specifically, he said that the private networks favored by many regulated companies are ""mathematically less secure"" than public blockchains, and Babylon is designed to capture the best of both paradigms.  ""It seems to me that some of the providers out there are trying to make distributed ledger technology in the same image of existing legacy infrastructure, with commercial databases and sitting behind firewalls,"" Patten said, adding:  ""I would argue that the reason bitcoin and ethereum are successful is because it's not like that.""  More certainty  Beyond just a faster, more transparent messaging platform, though, Babylon is being positioned as a more secure alternative to traditional services.  While legacy institutions worry about the security of public blockchains with unknown actors, Patten argues that private blockchains alone can't be as secure or resistant to collusion as public alternatives.  To address those concerns, Babylon hashes transactions both on its own distributed ledger and to the public ethereum blockchain. In the future, that data could also be hashed to the bitcoin blockchain or any number of permissioned distributed ledgers, according to Patten.  In theory, such a ledger could be used to verify transaction messages before they complete, making more difficult the kinds of hacks where infiltrators take on the identities of network participants.  He concluded:  ""The more ledgers you hash to, the more mathematical certainty that it hasn't been altered, because you have to hack two networks.""

42400658,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcKJRl,1510746319,"Turning Tide? Bitcoin Tops $7,000 As Price Pushes Up","Bitcoin is maintaining a bid tone today, with prices testing the $7,000 mark.  As per the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization rose to an intraday high of $7,009 at 11:25 UTC. At press time, the bitcoin-U.S. dollar (BTC/USD) exchange rate is around $7,007 levels. Data from CoinMarketCap indicates that bitcoin has gained nearly 6.74 percent in the last 24 hours.  The move marks a recovery of around 25 percent from bitcoin's recent lows near $5,000, though is still at least 10 percent short of the record highs above $7,800 hit last week.  Price action analysis suggests the tide is slowly turning in favor of the bulls, although the last major domino – the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement – is yet to fall.  Bitcoin chart  As discussed in the previous update  , bitcoin prices have moved higher after having consolidated above the key trendline level.  The chart above shows:  The 5-day moving average (MA) has bottomed out and is now curled up in favor of the bulls, courtesy of the price gains seen today.  Bitcoin is struggling to break above $6,986 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the recent sell-off).  The RSI has moved back above 50.00 (in the bullish territory) and is trending upwards.  View  Retracement levels are based on the prior move (sell-off from record highs) and alert traders or investors to a potential trend reversal.  A close above the 61.8 percent Fibonacci (Fib) retracement level of $6,986 would indicate a revival of the bull run and open the doors for a move towards the record highs above $7,800.  As long as bitcoin trades below 61.8 percent Fib level, the 29 percent rally from the recent lows near $5,000 would qualify as a ""corrective rally"" in a strong downtrend (sell-off from record highs).  Bear case scenario: Failure to close above the 61.8 percent Fib level followed by a drop below the rising trendline support (seen today at $6,555) would indicate the corrective rally has ended. Prices could then proceed to test the upward sloping 50-day MA seen today at $5,723.  4-hour chart  The price action detailed under the bear case scenario would only add credence to the bearish 50-MA and 100-MA crossover seen on the 4-hour chart above and strengthen the case for a drop to $5,750–$5,723.  Also, note that the 61.8 percent Fib level of $6,986 is closely aligned with the psychological barrier of $7,000. Thus, we can conclude that $7,000 is a ""make or break"" level to watch out for over the next day or two.

42400655,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcKJOo,1510740009,SecureKey Taps IBM Blockchain for Digital Identity System Launch,"Canadian startup SecureKey has revealed it will soon launch a blockchain-based system providing identity verification across the country.  Expected to go live in early 2018, the new digital identity platform utilizes IBM's blockchain technology, enabling consumers to prove their identity using cellphones and Windows devices to governments, banks and telecom providers, said Greg Wolfond, CEO of SecureKey.  According to Bloomberg, Wolfond said the blockchain ID system enables consumers to control and share their personal information without going through centralized systems that create ""honeypots"" of valuable information that are vulnerable to hackers.  Wolfond added:  ""This is transformational for identity. It makes it easier for me to prove it's me and harder for the 'bad guy' to masquerade as me.""  Bloomberg said that Toronto-Dominion Bank, the Royal Bank of Canada, and a number of other major financial firms have invested $30 million Canadian dollars ($23.5 million) in the scheme.  The ID system was first announced back in in March 2017, where the company explained that the IBM Blockchain tech is built on top of the open-source Hyperledger Fabric v1.0 platform.  The new system ""will help tackle the toughest challenges surrounding identity,” said Marie Wieck, general manager of IBM Blockchain, at the time.

42400640,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcKJA3,1510736404,'Shitshow' to Success? Bitcoin Gold's Launch Has Been Anything But Smooth,"An attack, a chain split and general chaos on social media aren't getting the developers behind bitcoin's latest fork down.  The bitcoin gold cryptocurrency, which split from bitcoin in October, at the time touting a new mining scheme, has had a rocky start since it launched its live network on Nov. 12.  Within the first day after its release, one of the network's mining pools, ""pool.gold,"" suffered a denial-of-service attack that took it offline for an hour and a half. Shortly after, the blockchain split when pool.gold and another mining pool called Suprnova found blocks at the same time.  Eventually, one chain was ruled as the ledger of record, but not before mining was halted on the other chain and pool.gold reset, erasing funds for some unlucky miners.  ""It's just been a mess with the opening – nodes not syncing and different heights of the blockchain and then restarting nodes and resetting and erasing miner's totals,"" said a bitcoin gold miner who wished to remain anonymous.  He added candidly:  ""[It's] just a shitshow.""  Still, observers might have a different reaction, as the difficulties appear to validate criticisms of the bitcoin gold developer team, which has come under scrutiny for deciding to set aside the first round of block rewards for the developer team.  Even MinerTopia, a crypto mining community that opened access to bitcoin gold, threw shade at the developers, tweeting, ""It's been sad since the day it launched. Very poor quality devs. They made their money now and ran and left the mess to all the pool owners and miners.""  'No pump and dump'  That said, many in the bitcoin gold community remain optimistic that these early issues will be overcome with persistence and ingenuity.  One of the main complaints in the aftermath of the pool.gold chain split, for example, came from miners wondering what happened to the bitcoin gold they had mined.  About $70,000-worth of bitcoin gold was lost in the decision to migrate to just one of the two chains, and in response, bitcoin gold developer Martin Kuvandzhiev said the miners who lost out are being given funds from the developer team's own ""pre-mined"" stake.  He told CoinDesk:  ""The miners deserve it. The decision was taken to recover all the funds because this is the way to treat this kind of situation.""  In this way, the developers behind the project argue the distribution shows their capacity to properly allocate the funds they set aside and that have proven so contentious.  Kuvandzhiev said 40 percent of the 100,000 bitcoin gold coins (less than 1 percent of the total 21 million) the development team mined before the network was opened to the public are available to be spent. And to spend any of the coins, four of six developers must sign a transaction.  As for the other 60 percent of the coins? Those are time-locked, meaning they are to be released gradually over the next three years for development costs.  ""There's no way to pump-and-dump,"" Kuvandzhiev said. ""We're taking all the measures required just to make sure we're doing the things right.""  Room for enthusiasm  And although it's had a slow start, bitcoin gold does seem to be faring relatively well.  Yavor Todorov, a bitcoin gold developer who provides support for the cryptocurrency's miners, acknowledged that, despite the ""chaos on social media,"" the network itself is stable.  More than 50,000 machines are mining bitcoin gold within a handful of mining pools, according to Kuvandzhiev. And crypto exchange HitBTC has begun supporting bitcoin gold trading, while wallet provider Coinomi has added support, hinting at early business adoption.  The bitcoin gold team also supports a core wallet, and hardware wallet provider Trezor released code that allows users to download the software to store bitcoin gold. Kuvandzhiev also expects Ledger, another hardware wallet provider, to add support in the coming weeks.  Furthermore, the development team is working with other exchanges and wallets to add support for the new coin.  According to the bitcoin gold block explorer, transactions are happening also, just not at regular intervals yet. An account that hadn't made a transaction with bitcoin for nearly seven years even claimed about $5 million-worth of bitcoin gold after its release.  Based on this early activity, the anonymous miner that spoke to CoinDesk said he expects everything to calm down and start running normally in the next few days, given what he positioned as the strength of the project's value proposition.  ""I'm sure the people that are actually excited to have a bitcoin chain that's back to mining without ASICs will stick around,"" he said.  Finger pointing continues  But first, those on the development team have to settle the confusion and contention.  And that isn't looking easy. For one, scam wallets have popped up to bilk users; in response, the development team is currently doing reconnaissance to put together a list of known scams.  Secondly, on Monday afternoon, Todorov stated on the project's official Slack channel that Suprnova had gained 51 percent of the network's mining power, a centralization that bitcoin gold launched to eliminate.  And lastly, several users are incensed by a 0.5 percent ""hidden fee"" for mined blocks that Kuvandzhiev integrated into the mining pool software he developed.  According to Kuvandzhiev, he told miners about the fee, which could be manually removed from the open-source code, in Slack chats, but because he didn't list the addition in the GitHub code repository, some thought the addition was a trick.  Kuvandzhiev suggested the outrage was caused by the one mining pool that hadn't removed the fee line in the code. Either way, he has since merged a pull request to delete the fee altogether.  To him, however, the incident just goes to show how delicate a process launching a new cryptocurrency can be, and how transparency rules on the open, public ledger.  ""For a single miner with one mining rig this [fee] is $1 per month, which is nothing I think,"" he told CoinDesk, adding:  ""I hoped people will just appreciate that I have spent this time to make a product for them.""

The Wyoming Blockchain Coalition was announced on Tuesday, aimed at advancing use of the technology within the state. The group intends to lobby for eased regulatory burdens and the creation of a more business-friendly environment for blockchain companies.  Past moves on the part of some Wyoming lawmakers suggests the group might find a warm reception. In January 2016, a group of lawmakers released a bill which sought to make it easier for companies seeking to offer cryptocurrency exchanges to operate. At the time, it was framed as an effort to win back firms that had departed previously because of the regulatory environment there.  Those supporting the effort are also seeking to advance public-sector applications of the tech as well.  ""The mission of the Wyoming Blockchain Coalition is to educate Wyoming citizens about the power of blockchain technology to cut costs, streamline administrative processes and spur entirely new businesses in Wyoming.” David Pope, the group's executive director, said in a statement.  Among the group's listed backers are former Wyoming governor Jim Geringer, current Cheyenne Mayor Marian Orr, Overstock.com CEO Patrick Byrne, Symbiont chairman and president Caitlin Long, and two deans from the University of Wyoming, among others.

42400654,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcKJMq,1510722054,Singapore's Central Bank Outlines When ICOs Are and Aren't Securities,"Singapore's de facto central bank has published new guidelines on initial coin offerings (ICOs), outlining how token sales would be viewed under its securities laws.  According to a Nov. 14 statement from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), tokens sold through the blockchain funding model may be considered securities under certain circumstances, citing Singapore's Securities and Futures Act (SFA) as well as the Financial Advisers Act.  The MAS said:  ""Offers or issues of digital tokens may be regulated by MAS if the digital tokens are capital markets products under the SFA. Capital markets products include any securities, futures contracts and contracts or arrangements for purposes of leveraged foreign exchange trading.""  The new report includes several case studies, including one detailing a token tied to a computing power-sharing platform (which wouldn't count as a security) and another that is focused on a token connected to a startup investment fund (which would count as a security).  The guidelines also shore up earlier statements from the MAS. In August, officials stated that some token sales would be subject to securities laws on the basis that the cryptographic data sold would constitute kinds of debentures or stakes in collective investment schemes.  Further, the MAS said in its new guidelines that other Singapore laws may apply to token sales, including the ones that don't ultimately come under its direct jurisdiction.  ""Digital tokens that perform functions which may not be within MAS' regulatory purview may nonetheless be subject to other legislation for combating money laundering and terrorism financing,"" the report states.  In the area of money laundering and terrorism financing in particular, the MAS said that it would move to develop a new payments service framework that would cover companies involved in ""the dealing or exchange of virtual currencies for fiat or other virtual currencies.""  ""Such intermediaries will be required to put in place policies, procedures and controls to address such risks. These will include requirements to conduct customer due diligence, monitor transactions, perform screening, report suspicious transactions and keep adequate records,"" the MAS wrote.

42400648,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcKJIu,1510716625,"Bitcoin Bulletproofed: Wuille, Maxwell and More Propose Scalable Privacy Tech","Bitcoin may be one step closer to offering users improved confidentiality.  Proposed in a new paper authored by heavyweight cryptographers including Dan Boneh, Pieter Wuille and Greg Maxwell, ""Bulletproofs"" outlines a new technique that would reduce the size of so-called ""confidential transaction"" code – long floated as a possible way to shield the transaction amounts currently public on the blockchain, the cryptocurrency's globally distributed ledger.  A rough sketch of the confidential transactions idea was first proposed informally on a popular bitcoin forum in 2013 by Adam Back, CEO of bitcoin startup Blockstream, and while the technology has been iterated on over the years, it still comes with a high cost. Transactions that use the technology take up about 16 times more space in the blockchain than normal bitcoin transactions.  Because of this, the idea has been dismissed as too bulky for the live bitcoin network, which is already facing much-discussed scaling problems.  But the new paper, co-authored also by Benedikt Bunz, Jonathan Bootle and Andrew Poelstra, contends Bulletproofs will slash the size of confidential transactions to under even that of a normal transaction.  In the announcement email, Maxwell said:  ""This cuts the bloat factor down to about 3x for today's traffic patterns.""  However, Maxwell went on to note that even though the confidential transactions idea is making progress, there are still issues to iron out. For one, the time it takes to verify a confidential transaction is still a ""bottleneck"" developers are continuing to chip away at.  And while the researchers can't yet hint when the code might go live, the strength of the team hints at the growing awareness that some public blockchains are lacking in privacy.  For example, privacy emerged as a hot topic during ethereum's annual developer conference Devcon3 this year, with the protocol looking to integrate zk-snarks, the tech behind anonymous cryptocurrency zcash. The example also serves to highlight the different approaches to the issue being taken across communities.
