Kronos Breach: Investigation Underway On Sunday, November 19, Kronos Research disclosed – via a post on X (formerly Twitter) – a security incident that involved unauthorized access to its API keys. Consequently, the company lost a significant amount of crypto funds and has halted all trading operations in a bid to launch a full investigation into the incident. A map of funds outflow by on-chain sleuth ZachXBT summed Kronos’ losses to over $25 million in Ether. In a follow-up post on X, the company also confirmed that the losses are about $26 million in crypto assets. Funds outflow from Kronos Wallet | Source: X/ZachXBT Related Reading: Yearn Finance Tumbles: Rug Pull Rumors Swirl As Token Takes A 45% Hit In its initial announcement, Kronos revealed that the potential losses are not a significant portion of its equity. Meanwhile, the trading firm said in its latest update that all losses will be covered internally, and no partners will be affected. Although Kronos has yet to provide an update on its resumption process, the company did say that it aims to resume trading as soon as possible. This $26 million attack on Kronos Research represents the third most significant crypto theft in November 2023. Before this latest incident, data from blockchain security firm Certik revealed that about $173 million had been lost to crypto attacks in November, with Poloniex’s $113 million hack being the most notable yet. How Did This Hack Affect WOO X? Interestingly, Kronos is not the only one affected by this security incident, as WOO X is another cryptocurrency entity that has had to pause its operations momentarily. WOO X is an exchange on which Kronos functions as the market maker for its spot and perpetual futures markets. In an address on the X platform, WOO X acknowledged Kronos’ security situation and announced a temporary pause on all trading to protect users’ positions from a lack of liquidity. The exchange, however, emphasized that all customer funds are safe. Related Reading: Ethereum Whistleblower Reveals When Proof Of ETH Founders’ Fraud Will Be Released As of this writing, WOO X has resumed trading in both the spot and perpetual futures markets. Meanwhile, the exchange claims that clients can now make withdrawals for all assets.

20409551,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=561423,1700412038,Hashkey-Affiliated Wallet Sells Over $90 Million ETH In 10 Days – Report,"A wallet linked to Hong Kong-based crypto exchange Hashkey has reportedly sold over $90 million worth of Ethereum in the past 10 days. This massive selling activity appears to have triggered a slight decline in the ETH market, sparking speculations on the token’s price trajectory. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Holds Ground – Indicators Suggest Fresh Surge To $2,120 Crypto Whale Conducts Massive Ethereum Sell-Off According to a Sunday post on X by blockchain analytics platform, Lookonchain, a crypto wallet with the address “0xD26e ” sold off 50,115 ETH, valued at $97.7 million, within a period of 10 days. Lookonchain notes that this wallet is related to Hashkey, having received a majority of the sold-off ETH from the Hong Kong-based exchange. At an average selling price of $2,047, wallet “0xD26e” conducted its ETH sell-off on the Binance and OKX exchanges, withdrawing $89.6 million USDT and $12.95 million USDC in return. As earlier stated, ETH dipped by over 4% in the last week, which is likely in response to such massive selling pressure. However, the second-largest cryptocurrency has now found some stability, gaining by 0.92% in the last day, as it attempts to breach the $2000 mark again. Related Reading: Ethereum ETF Race: BlackRock Wants An Ether Spot ETF What’s Next For ETH? Looking at ETH’s daily chart, it appears the selling spree by wallet “0xD26e” could be a precaution against an incoming significant decline in the token’s value. After all, the Relative Strength Index indicates that ETH just left the overbought zone and could still experience more losses in the coming days. Albeit, this downward trend is likely to be short-lived, considering the high level of investor interest currently around the altcoin due to the brimming Ether spot ETF race in the United States. On Friday, Fidelity Investments became the seventh and the latest asset management giant to join the brawl, having submitted its “Fidelity Ethereum Fund” proposal to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In addition to the Massachusetts-based company, other asset managers looking to launch an Ether Spot ETF include prominent names like BlackRock, Hasdhdex, Grayscale, VanEck, and 21Shares and Ark. It is expected that other asset managers will join the race over the next few weeks, which will lead to a rise in positive sentiments towards Ethereum. While approval by the SEC is still very subjective and uncertain, the mere influx of Ether Spot ETF applications signals an increasing interest in the altcoin from traditional finance investors, which in turn boosts investments in any cryptocurrency. For example, following reports of Blackrock’s filling on November 9, ETH gained by almost 13% to trade above the $2,130 mark in response to the buying pressure that followed. At the time of writing, ETH trades at $1,950, with a 0.34% gain in the last hour, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Meanwhile, the token’s trading volume is down by 32.64% and valued at $7. 32 billion.

Although data from CoinMarketCap at the time of writing puts XRP being up by 1.78% in the past 24 hours, a larger seven-day timeframe shows it is still down by 8.68%. On the other hand, price metrics including open interest on futures contracts and a bullish divergence with the RSI indicate the potential for a significant increase in the value of the token in the near future. Crypto Analyst Sees Solid XRP Price Action According to crypto analyst Will Taylor known as Cryptoinsightsuk on social media, XRP is showing signs of bullish momentum that could drive the price up to his target of $1.35. The analyst took to social media platform X to point out two metrics indicating a bullish price and explain their significance. Finally, $XRP.$XRP actually looks rather different to the other charts I’ve have just discussed. We had $100m+ of OI added to the market in the highlighted spike (on the day of the fake ETF news).

XRP also experienced a significant price jump of 16% to $0.75 simultaneously. However, Cryptoinsightsuk pointed out that while the crypto has since lost this price spike, the amount of open interest has stayed relatively the same. Related Reading: Dogecoin Metrics Signal Impending Breakout, How High Can The Price Go? According to the analyst, since the price of XRP has gone down, the amount of open interest on futures contracts remaining the same means they are probably short trade positions. “This shows me, there are HUGE shorts on $XRP right now,” he said. Taking a glance at the price chart that the trader provided indicates the formation of lower highs and lower lows by XRP. The recent action was a bounce up and it is now approaching the descending upper trendline formed by the lower highs. He noted that a break above the descending trendline could be the start of an uptrend for XRP. Total crypto market cap is currently at $1.3 trillion. Chart: TradingView.com This might encourage people to cover their open short positions or close them out by placing buy trades, which in turn could lead to a more aggressive breakout in the market. “This could cascade stop losses to the upside and push XRP on a fast move,” he said. Bullish Divergence With The RSI The trader also noted the recent creation of a higher low in XRP’s price created a bullish divergence with the RSI overbought/oversold indicator. This bullish divergence demonstrates that bulls are poised to regain control of the market and that bears are beginning to lose momentum. “XRP will get sent to my target range of $0.89 – $1.35,” he predicted.

20400334,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=561396,1700395246,Cardano Founder Courts OpenAI’s Sam Altman – What Does He Want To Build?,"OpenAI recently announced a shocking leadership change with Sam Altman being ousted as CEO. After five years of being at the helm of taking OpenAI from a $0 to $80 billion valuation, the AI company is now at a crossroads with Altman departing and former Chief Technology Officer (CTO), Mira Murati taking over as interim CEO. Altman hasn’t provided specifics of his next actions; however, he has posted on social media that he “will have more to say about what’s next later.” In light of this, Charles Hoskinson, the creator of Cardano, sees a window of opportunity. Hoskinson gave the former CEO a bold proposal on social media platform X to join hands in establishing a decentralized language learning model in partnership with the Cardano blockchain. Sam @sama since you have some free time now. If you are interested in doing a decentralized LLM, then hit me up. Would be a fun Cardano Partnerchain — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) November 18, 2023 Hoskinson Wants To Build A Decentralized Language Learning Model Charles Hoskinson has a vision for AI that embraces decentralization and openness. As the founder of Cardano and a former co-founder of Ethereum, Hoskinson knows a thing or two about building decentralized networks. Hoskinson’s vision of a decentralized language learning model is ambitious, but promising. Related Reading: Crypto Acceptance Grows As Fidelity Joins Race For A Spot Ethereum ETF On the other end, if there’s anyone who knows anything about language learning models, it is definitely Sam Altman. The former CEO is known for being one of the architects of the language models that power ChatGPT, which has gained widespread adoption since its launch in November 2022. Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading at $36.680. Chart: TradingView.com If Altman takes Hoskinson up on his offer, it could mark a turning point in how AI models like ChatGPT are built and how they serve users. A decentralized LLM would essentially be available to everyone and resistant to censorship, tampering, and monopolization by governments and large corporations, which is one of the concerns being raised regarding existing LLMs. Aftermath Of Sam Altman’s Removal As CEO Altmann’s removal as CEO sent ripples around the AI and crypto industries. Greg Brockman, president and one of the co-founders of OpenAI, also announced his departure from the company. As one would expect, WorldCoin reacted negatively to the news. According to data from Coinmarketcap, Worldcoin (WLD) dropped by 12.75% in the hours following the news of the CEO’s removal. However, the crypto has since recovered and is now trading at $2.38. Related Reading: Kaspa Binance Listing Sparks Frenzy: 50% Price Surge Captures Investors’ Interest According to OpenAI’s announcement, the decision to fire Altman was made by the board of directors, as they’ve lost confidence in his ability to continue his duties as CEO due to his lack of transparency in his communications. However, rumors are that OpenAI investors are looking to reinstate Altmann into his job as CEO. Cardano ADA is trading at $0.375 at the time of writing. According to a crypto analyst, ADA could spike to the $0.78 mark if it is able to break out of the current falling wedge pattern.

20396186,http://blokt.com/?p=41051,1700379053,Ledger Blue Review: Worth it? Or are Ledger Nano X and Nano S better?,"The Ledger Blue hardware wallet is an enterprise-grade device produced by French manufacturer Ledger; a specialist crypto security company established in 2014. Founded by cryptographic and tech security experts, Ledger has over 130 employees and has sold 1.5 million hardware wallets to date . Released in 2016, the Ledger Blue is one of three hardware wallets currently sold by Ledger, and unlike it’s smaller and simpler cousin the Ledger Nano S , the Ledger Blue is a futuristic and attractive device which features a large touchscreen interface and metallic body . Ledger Blue review (2023) – Is it worth buying instead of the Ledger Nano S or Nano X? Find out below. As you might expect, as one of the most premium hardware wallets available, the Ledger Blue doesn’t come cheap. In fact, it’s one of the most expensive devices on the market , six times the price of the Ledger Nano S, which has left some cryptocurrency users skeptical about its value for money. In this Ledger Blue review, we will examine the tech behind the Ledger Blue device, it’s pros and cons, and most importantly, whether it’s worth splashing out on. Note : For all the ETH holders out there, you can also check out our guide to the best Ethereum wallets , where the Ledger product range also features. Device Overview The Ledger Blue is large – one of the largest devices on the market , and more closely resembles a smartphone than a hardware wallet. Made from a Zamak metal alloy frame , with a plastic tactile back, and a full glass screen on the front , the Ledger Blue is an eye-catching device which fits nicely in hand . It’s clearly built using high-quality materials, giving an overall premium feel to the device . The Ledger Blue’s large touch screen makes transactions simple However, the bezel around the screen is disappointingly large , and there’s definitely room to expand the interface to give a more modern experience. Dimensions : 97 mm x 68 x 10 mm Weight : 90 g Connection : USB Type Micro-B CPU : ST31G480 (Secure) + STM32L476 Display : 3.5 inch LCD CurrencySupport : Over 1,000 assets SupportedOS : 64-bit Windows, 64-bit Mac OS, and 64-bit Linux. Price : ~ $300 Get Ledger Blue Ledger Blue Unboxing The Ledger Blue comes in compact packaging, and users may notice that unlike other hardware wallet manufacturers which provide tamper-proof packaging, Ledger packaging comes free from physical tamper-proofing stickers . There’s a good reason for this , which we’ll explore later, and it’s because Ledger uses a secure chip in its hardware wallets . In the box, users will find their Ledger Blue on top, with accessories underneath, including a recovery phrase sheet, a micro USB cable, and a well-made carry case to keep the device protected. However, compared to hardware wallets such as the KeepKey , which provides users with a quality woven USB cable, or the Trezor Model-T which comes with a magnetic docking station, the Ledger Blue is relatively simple despite its high ticket price. Note: For more details on the Model-T, check out our in-depth Trezor Model-T Review . Coin Support Ledger has excelled itself when it comes to coin support, with over 1,180 supported assets , and overall the Ledger Blue is no different, supporting 30 cryptos which run on their own chains, alongside all the ERC-20 tokens. That said, some assets are missing from the Ledger Blue which are supported by its cheaper counterpart , the Ledger Nano S. Coin Support Specifically, here are some of the major market cap coins which aren’t supported by the Ledger Blue, but are supported on the Ledger Nano S: EOS Cardano IOTA Monero Tezos Vechain Nano Lisk The lack of support for coins with such huge communities may explain why the Ledger Nano S has sold over 1.4 million units, compared to just 10,000 for the Ledger Blue . Pick up a Ledger Blue Staff Pick Ledger Blue Hardware Wallet Get It Security Features Like Ledger’s other hardware wallets, the Ledger Blue is based around a secure element chip, alongside Ledger’s proprietary BOLOS hardware architecture , which offers bank-grade security for your cryptographic assets. The secure chip prevents tampering, and if the device has been modified before use, the user will be alerted on set-up . Importance of Security Features – Source: ShutterStock.com Before any transaction can be processed, the Ledger Blue requires user’s manual consent to authenticate the transaction. Consent is given via the Ledger Blue device, and private keys or other sensitive data are never exposed to the computer your device is connected to . Unlike other manufacturers , Ledger doesn’t release open-source code for its devices . However, the code for individual asset apps is open-source and available on its GitHub . Set-up and First-time Use As with all Ledger products, the team has done a great job of usability and simplicity , and the Ledger Blue’s screen makes the set-up process even easier to complete. New users will download the Ledger Live platform, which serves as a plug-and-play interface for setting up, sending and receiving assets on any Ledger device. Likewise, users can set up apps for new assets through Ledger Live . To send crypto assets, users use the Ledger Live platform to launch the app for their respective asset and then launch the corresponding app on their Ledger Blue device. Users can then fill in the required fields (i.e., amount, recipient address, fees), and hit ‘send.’ The Ledger Blue will then ask users to confirm the transaction before they continue. The Ledger Live app walks users through device setup in minutes To receive assets to the Ledger Blue, the process is virtually the same in reverse, and the Ledger Live platform guides users through the process . Pros & Cons Pros Cons Easy to use UI and touchscreen Features Ledgers secure chip technology Robust and modern design Prohibitively expensive for the average user Coin support is lower than Ledgers much cheaper Nano S One of the largest and heaviest hardware wallets on market Not open-source hardware Pros and Cons Get Ledger Blue Buying the Ledger Blue Hardware Wallet So, should you buy the Ledger Blue hardware wallet? There’s no doubt that this is a striking piece of technology. As easy to use as a smartphone , with all of Ledger’s tried-and-tested security features, including their unique secure chip technology, the Ledger Blue scores highly in cryptographic security and ease of access . However, when it comes to coin support, the Ledger Blue actually has fewer supported assets than its much cheaper counterpart , the Ledger Nano S, and some popular cryptos, such as Nano, Lisk , and EOS are missing from the Ledger Blue. Considering how much time the average user will spend interacting with their hardware wallet on a daily basis, there is a tradeoff to be made between price and utility with the Ledger Blue. Buy the Ledger Blue hardware wallet If you’re a frequent user , for example, a high volume trader who likes to keep custody of their private keys in cold storage between trades, then the Ledger Blue makes the entire process of transacting cryptocurrencies quicker and easier than most other hardware wallets on the market – very helpful when time is of the essence. For the average crypto holder, who simply wants custody over their private keys while they hold for a few months or years, the Ledger Nano S would suffice, and at just one-sixth of the cost of the Ledger Blue. The Verdict Overall, the Ledger Blue is a fantastic device which really shows what hardware wallets are capable of . That said, users should ask themselves what they need the device for, and if it’s just casual use, this wallet is likely a prohibitively expensive option – which could be why the Ledger Blue has sold far fewer units than the Ledger Nano S . The Verdict Additionally, with the Ledger Nano X now on sale, featuring a bigger screen and fast Bluetooth connectivity at under half the price of the Ledger Blue ($119), many will opt for this latest state-of-the-art device.
