42416893,eB3NjBN6VPjgNZ6DbOxhb0,1377267931,Golden answers to your bitcoin questions,"Welcome to the CoinDesk Weekly Review 23rd August 2013 — a regular look at the hottest, most controversial and thought-provoking events in the world of digital currency through the eyes of skepticism and wonder. Your host … John Law  Bitcoining it, 1980s style  You may have heard of the Osborne effect. Named after early personal computer entrepreneur Adam Osborne, it describes what happens when a company kills its cash flow – and itself – by announcing a new product so far ahead of production that the drop in sales of the old product is fatal. There was a very successful Osborne 1 PC launched in 1981; the superior Osborne Executive was announced in 1982 but not delivered in numbers quickly enough to replace lost sales.  Bear that in mind when reading about Butterfly Labs' latest announcement – the Monarch – which, while it has splendid specifications, has no firm delivery date beyond ‘towards the end of the year’ ’ (at the time of the announcement - new orders placed are now stated to be delivered in February 2014 - Ed). Factor in Butterfly’s much-noted problems in delivering on its current product line, and ask yourself “Do they feel lucky, punk?”.  Butterfly might take heart from one additional fact about the Osborne effect – it isn’t quite true. While there were indeed cancelled sales and a buildup of inventory of the Osborne 1 after the Executive had been shown to journalists, they weren’t the only causes of the company’s demise a few months later. Poor quality control, trouble meeting deliveries, a decision to expensively complete some unfinished obsolete products, and superior competition. probably contributed even more to the final bankruptcy.  Hm. Perhaps that isn’t too much comfort for House Butterfly. While it’s understandable that the company wants to put up a good fight with competitors like CoinTerra promising (but also not yet delivering) very high performance mining rigs, it’s a high risk strategy when many customers are still waiting for their gear. With personal computers, it didn’t take long for designs to become obsolete, but that’s nothing compared to Bitcoin’s built-in performance degradation over time. Every day, a mining rig’s specification is worth a little less.  Add in the – shall we say, legally bold – claim by Butterfly that ‘sales are final’ and that no refunds will be forthcoming for non-delivery (in the UK at least, that doesn’t fly), and its move to only accepting non-reversible payments, and it starts to look as if there may indeed be lessons from the early days of personal computers for both bitcoin miner hardware producers and would-be purchasers.  Meanwhile, for those who may not have been born in 1982, here is a video of an Osborne Executive booting up and running some software. John Law was there at the time so can confirm that yes, this is how it was; but, at a 2013 equivalent price of some £3,000, it was not for him. In thirty years time, what will be said about the Monarch?  How to avoid tiresome questions  Bitcoin and its fellow cybercurrencies are the newest inventions in town, at least among those that you can actually use. Which is cool, and thus it’s entirely proper that people of taste and distinction should concern themselves with the whole field. The only downside with being a techno-trendsetter, as you will be all too aware, is that one’s expertise in such an exciting area leads to one’s friends, family, servants and entourage asking questions. How does bitcoin work? Will it lead to the collapse of civilisation? Can it make me insanely rich? How do you spell Nakamoto?  The first few times, such questions are charming. There is a certain gratification in guru status, in lightly reeling off the perfect answer to a complex question. Eventually, though, one realises that the endless quizzing is getting in the way of more important matters. Bordeaux: the ‘78 or the ‘85? Cigars: Bolivar Belicoso Fino or H. Upmann Royal Robusto? The offie: White Lightning or Special Brew?  Help is here. The CoinDesk bitcoin information centre – modestly labelled The beginner’s guide to bitcoin – has all the answers you need to keep the baying hordes satisfied. It’s a distillation of everything the site knows about bitcoin – which is to say, everything worth knowing – in a format that practically screams ease-of-use.  While he has the greatest respect for the toiling multitudes who keep CoinDesk on the road, John Law considers that perhaps they’ve been a little too generous here – if they’d strung out all that valuable info over a few weeks, think of all the gratuitous site traffic. But no, it’s all there all at once. One bookmark, and expert status is guaranteed.  Admittedly, the question of whether bitcoin will make you stupidly wealthy remains unanswered. Which leaves the small matter of the ‘78 versus the ‘85 slightly more difficult to resolve, without sufficient funds to buy up and consume the entire run of both vintages. Nonetheless, next time you bump into John Law in a City wine bar, do ask. Perhaps headway can be made while we’re all waiting.  A golden answer to the hardest question  There is one question that deserves a serious answer, but remains one of the hardest: what is a bitcoin, exactly? From a computer science perspective, that’s fairly simple – it’s a signed token generated by and handled through a distributed open-source cryptographic protocol. Which is as accurate and as useless as defining gold as a transition metal with atomic weight 197 and a Poisson ratio of 0.44. That doesn’t explain why nations go to war, people fall in love, and lives are spent because of the stuff.  Quite a lot of effort is being expended on behalf of bitcoin too, despite it being so new and so difficult to grasp. In that, it has something in common with gold, the oldest and most immediately physical container of enduring value mankind has devised. Is there a clue here to help with that difficult question?  The Germans think so  . While the rest of the world is caught up trying to sort out whether bitcoin is Good or Bad, to be encouraged or squelched, the harbinger of chaos or the bringer of freedom, the Germans have decided to analyse what bitcoin is first and worry about what it might do afterwards. It’s a cool, clinical and very practical approach to the issue which John Law finds enormously refreshing in a global climate more given currently to overheated politics and gut reaction.  So, Germany, what is a bitcoin? “A unit of value.” Which is to say, not a currency, nor an e-currency, a financial instrument, or any of the special monetary things which are more or less incomprehensible to non-experts. It just has value. You can create it as you wish – in the same way that you can create anything of value, by writing a book, making jam from strawberries, or digging gold from the ground – and it’s of no interest to the state except that it’s worth having, you can prove you did it, and you own it.  If you then go about trading it, whether that means turning it into Euros or swapping it for a car, then the normal state rules about fraud, tax and so on, apply. But bitcoin itself? Unthreatening, useful, worth protecting, a natural expression of man’s sense that an individual’s work can be converted to a value recognised by society.  It’s a simple definition, yet profound. Germany recognises that in the six thousand years mankind has been dealing with valuable stuff, a basic set of rules has evolved that handles most of the problems, and there’s no need to get too het up because a new way of storing value has appeared. Perhaps they could make a poster about it: keep calm and carry on.  Perhaps not. But another bottle of the ‘85? Now that’s a unit of value.

42416881,eB3NjBN6VPjgNZ6DbOxhKk,1377264042,Alydian targets big ticket miners with Terahash hosting,"Still waiting for that BFL MiniRig? In a little under a week, serious miners will be able to host Terahashes of ASIC mining power from Oregon-based Alydian – but only in large quantities.  The Californian company is preparing to host ASIC mining equipment for its customers, using yearly contracts. Its launch day pricing was $65,000 per Terahash, and mining hosting contracts are only available in 5 and 10 Th/sec blocks. So, if you're thinking of running a miner in your basement, you are not its target market.  Alydian will be going after institutional-level investors that want to move large amounts of money into bitcoins. The question is, how is it getting the capacity so early, and what will it mean for everyone else?  Alydian is the first portfolio company from Washington-based CoinLab, which is itself the brainchild of Peter Vessenes, who stepped down in July as executive director of the Bitcoin Foundation. It will be using 65 nm chips.  Fast production  The company and its incubator are capitalizing on being first. ASIC capacity is hard to come by, and aside from a couple of vendors who are trickling out boxes and boards, many vendors won’t ship until next month at the earliest.  Alydian’s $65,000 per TH/sec rate only applies to its 10 TH/sec tier. At $350,000 for a year’s worth of 5TH/sec mining, its prices are equivalent to $70,000 per TH/sec, or $70 per GH/sec. Comparatively, pricing from KnCMiner – calculated by dividing the cost of the box by its hash rate – equates to around $19 per GH/sec.  Butterfly Labs is currently trickling out miners using ASICs developed to the same 65nm process node sizes as Alydian’s. Its units offer $45-55 per Gh/sec. That’s still cheaper on paper than the Alydian solution.  But Vessenes says that to be fair, we should consider time in addition to the cost of a box when calculating the cost per Gigahash.  “Not only is there a time value of money, (mining now is worth more than waiting to mine), but also there is a calculation you must do about your terahashes,” he says. “What percent of bitcoins mined will they on average earn? Both of these, and the USD-BTC price play into the mining calculations, which is one reason it's hard to price and understand.”  Hash worth  Because hash rates are increasing all the time, and because network hash rate is directly related to difficulty, Vessenes believes that today’s hashes are worth more than tomorrow’s. “At 2%/day growth rates [he's talking about the network hash rate], an October 31 delivery from KnC at $19/GH equates to $62/GH on August 29,” he says (1.02 * 61 days = 62) “And that still leaves someone with two extra months of mining, plus of course the reduction in power costs.  He may be overestimating a couple of things, such as KnC’s delivery wait times. The Swedish firm plans to start delivering kit approximately one month, not two, after Alydian flips its own switch.  To be fair, we should also factor in electricity costs for home-operated miners. BFL’s systems run at around 5 watts per GH. If you operated one in California, which has horrendous residential energy costs, this would equate to around $7.67 per year, per GH/sec. That pushes it closer to Alydian’s pricing on a per-GH/sec basis, but assuming you got your BFL MiniRig this month and time wasn’t a factor, you’d still be churning out bitcoins for less than you’d be paying Alydian.  Vessenes suggests that these prices are a moveable feast – he is cutting deals for hash rates, he says. He adds that the premium is partly to do with convenience. “We want to provide a turnkey solution for institutional investors who don’t want to worry about it, and don’t want to go manage 72 Bitfury boxes.”  Supply chain expertise  Time is of the essence for Alydian. Will it make its deadline to fit its 65 nm chip onto boards and into boxes? Vessenes claims the chip is faster, and with a lower power consumption than its competitors. Hans Olsen, the company’s CEO, has experience in semiconductors, and Vessenes says that supply chain management is the firm’s forte.  “Hans and his team are super experienced in hardware and supply chain,” he said. “So when I look at the history of bitcoin mining firms, most of them drop the ball on the supply chain side. I think we'll see that this fall again.”  Alydian isn’t giving too much away about its backend operation. It won’t reveal its foundry, and is keeping quiet on any exchange partners. It has MSB licensing with FinCEN, but it isn't saying anything about any state-level licensing.  Assuming it makes its August 29th deadline, what happens next? Alydian is bringing 5 and 10TH/sec blocks of hosted ASIC capacity online this month, followed by 25 TH/sec in September, and 100 – 1000 TH/sec in October (that's one Petahash). Right now, the entire network’s hash rate is hovering around half a Petahash.  All this is going to push up network difficulty, and will no doubt make those who have ASIC miners currently on order a little nervous.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2013/08/23/alydian-targets-big-ticket-miners-with-terahash-hosting,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2b21a17d767bf62932d6ede85d80772750cc2f82-1000x549.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
