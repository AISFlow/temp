19132079,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=556329,1697842830,FBI Busts Indian Citizen Group For $15 Million Crypto-To-Cash Money Laundering Scheme,"In a recent crypto investigation, the US FBI successfully infiltrated a group of Indian citizens suspected of engaging in illicit activities involving the exchange of cryptocurrency for over $15 million in cash. The alleged transactions took place at various locations in Westchester County, with the group catering to customers seeking anonymity for their activities. Crypto Crime Unveiled According to recent reports, five out of the six suspects were apprehended on October 17 and subsequently charged in US District Court, White Plains. The charges primarily revolve around operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business. The investigation unfolded with the assistance of law enforcement agents who monitored 80 “cash hand-offs”. Related Reading: xDay 2023: Elon Musk’s X Competitor? xPortal Unveils Rival Features The FBI’s scrutiny began in April 2021 when they identified a suspect operating within the “dark web” criminal marketplaces. Although the individual remains unnamed in the criminal complaint, they are believed to be a co-conspirator of the arrested local suspects. Notably, the suspect offered to ship cash to customers in exchange for cryptocurrency. According to the complaint, the unidentified co-conspirator disclosed to an undercover officer in January that some of their customers were involved in drug sales, while their wealthier clients were hackers. The co-conspirator claimed to have amassed approximately $30 million over three years by exchanging cash for cryptocurrency. In February, an individual responsible for mailing packages of cash on behalf of the co-conspirator was arrested. The complaint reveals that this individual had been receiving sacks of cash from various individuals, three times a week for 18 months, at a Westchester County post office. The cash bundles ranged from $100,000 to $300,000. In a bid to receive leniency during sentencing, the aforementioned individual agreed to assist the FBI with their investigation. Over several months (from February 10 to September 27), they allegedly participated in 80 controlled cash pick-ups amounting to $15,067,000. One of the arrested individuals, Raju “Jay” Patel from Flushing Queens, played a significant role in the operation. The complaint alleges his involvement in 58 cash transfers totaling $10.8 million. Raju would collect cash from various locations in George, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and South Carolina. Subsequently, Raju allegedly coordinated the transfers with the co-conspirator and the FBI’s confidential source. On March 6, Raju allegedly arranged an exchange of $250,000 at a Tarrytown supermarket parking lot. Surveillance conducted by law enforcement agents captured Raju leaving his Queens apartment with an orange cloth bag, which he handed over to the FBI’s confidential source upon arrival in Tarrytown. The bag reportedly contained $249,715. Illicit Cash Exchange Similar exchanges took place at a parking lot in Port Chester, further implicating the suspects involved. On August 6, Shaileshkumar Goyani allegedly handed over a bag containing $114,000 to the FBI’s confidential source. Apart from Goyani, the complaint identifies Brijeshkumar “Samir” Patel, Hirenkkumar Patel, Naineshkumar Patel, and Nileshkumar Patel as additional suspects in the case. All the suspects are charged with operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business under New York and federal laws. Related Reading: Bulls Thrust Solana To $25 – What Traders Should Expect Next According to an affidavit by FBI agent Lawrence Lonergan, such unlicensed money-transmitting businesses operate as shadow banks, enabling funds to pass through without undergoing the scrutiny imposed by Congress on the United States financial system. While the allegations against Goyani’s crypto fraud remain unproven, his defense attorney, Daniel A. Hochheiser, emphasizes that his client has not been indicted by a grand jury. Hochheiser further stated that if and when an indictment is issued, Goyani intends to enter a plea of not guilty.

19129637,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=556361,1697839226,"CEO Is Super Bullish On Solana, Predicts SOL To 2X If This Pattern Is Confirmed","Raoul Pal, the founder of Real Vision and one of crypto frequent commentators, thinks SOL, the native currency of Solana, a smart contract platform, has “been extremely bullish all year.” In Pal’s assessment, the coin will likely double in the next few sessions, especially if there is a welcomed breakout above the immediate liquidation level. Taking to X on October 20, the founder noted that SOL has rallied by 171% in 2023 alone. At the same time, looking at technical candlestick arrangements, the immediate resistance level that traders should watch out for is $30. This line, Pal thinks, marks a critical liquidation level per the “big inverse head and shoulders” pattern evident in the daily chart. In technical analysis, this pattern signals that bear momentum is slowing, and the uptrend could be around the corner. Often, it forms when prices make three lows, with the middle low (the head) being lower than the other two lows (the shoulders). Related Reading: Bulls Thrust Solana To $25 – What Traders Should Expect Next Pal Is Bullish On Solana, Will SOL 2x? Even so, as Pal notes, the uptrend will be valid once there is a high volume bullish breakout above the “neckline.” In the Solana price chart in the daily chart, the neckline is at $30, a psychological level buyers have failed to break since it was registered in July 2023. This level also marks Solana’s highest price this year. While Solana struggles to overcome the strong resistance by USDT (and technically USD bulls), SOL bulls have been easing past resistance levels versus Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC). As of October 2023, SOL bulls appear to be reversing losses posted in 2022 versus the two top coins by market cap. To highlight this development, SOL is trading at new 2023 highs versus Ethereum, reversing losses and edging higher as bulls flock. SOL bulls have broken two critical liquidation zones at spot levels versus Ethereum registered in January and July. Still, Ethereum remains solid from a top-down preview, up 70% versus SOL reading from the SOLETH daily chart. Will SOL Rally Trigger “Crypto Summer” In 2024? While SOL bulls double down, the Real Vision CEO thinks the coin could lead the market to a “Crypto Summer” in 2024. The uptrend could be fanned by several developments, especially on partnerships struck in the recent past.

19127395,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=556308,1697835602,"Cardano’s Uncertain Path: Analyst Predicts Plunge, But What’s Next For ADA?","Recent analytical insights from JB, a crypto analyst from the Cheeky Crypto YouTube channel, suggest that Cardano (ADA) one of the leading altcoins in the crypto market might face a plunge before any potential resurgence. Anticipating A Downward Trend According to JB’s analysis, Cardano is possibly on the brink of a price dip. Following the cryptocurrency’s recent pullback, which was exacerbated by the unfounded news about a Bitcoin ETF approval, JB predicts ADA’s price could slide to a range between $0.2296 and $0.2185 before any possible upward reversal. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Getting Ready To Explode: Analyst Presents 16,500% Blowout JB further emphasized the broader crypto market’s sentiment, referencing the Fear and Greed index, which recently stood at 47 – a nearly neutral position. Interestingly, as highlighted by JB, this metric diverges from market expectations, as many assumed a more fearful sentiment following the unsubstantiated ETF news. Furthermore, to get a clearer picture of ADA’s potential trajectory, the analyst touched on fundamental factors concerning Cardano. Within the 24 hours leading to JB’s analysis, there were 38,256 active ADA addresses on the Cardano blockchain. Of these, 31,330 were receiving addresses, while 27,599 were sending. Moreover, during this period, ADA witnessed 55,893 transactions which accrued fees equivalent to 19,908 ADA or approximately $4,841. Another interesting observation was the addition of 4,086 blocks to the Cardano blockchain, pushing the block height past 9.434 million. When examining ADA’s holders, JB noted a 0.16% weekly increase in wallets possessing up to 10,000 ADA. This growth expanded to 0.55% over the past month. Conversely, wallets holding over 1,000 ADA experienced a 0.2% increase in the last week and a 0.08% rise over the month. Whales’ Play In Cardano (ADA) Price Movement? Another revelation by the analyst that caught attention was the plummeting number of wallets holding up to 1 million ADA. This segment saw a reduction from 2,789 to 2,773. This could insinuate that ADA whales might be partaking in a sell-off strategy. According to JB, their rationale could be to drive the price downwards, enabling them to repurchase ADA at more favorable rates, and setting the stage for more significant profit margins in the future. Related Reading: Cardano Whale Addresses Continue To Fall, What Does This Mean For ADA Price? Regardless of the analysis, ADA has experienced a notable increase in its price over the past week and has maintained a bullish trend in the last 24 hours, rising by 2.2% to a trading price of $0.251, at the time of writing. In addition, the altcoin’s trading volume has also appreciated significantly in the past week. Particularly, ADA’s daily trading volume has surged from below $95,000 recorded this last Friday to as high as above $150,000, in the last 24 hours.

One of the most prominent decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols in this ecosystem, the DEX has processed over $3 billion in trading volume, according to data from Token Terminal. Aggarwal is a validator for MultiversX, the “only non-Cosmos” network he validates. In an interview with our team, the Osmosis Co-Founder spoke about the early days of MultiversX, when the project was known as Elrond Network. Aggarwal was one of the first to see the Elrond (MultiversX) Whitepaper and has been helping as a “non-official” external consultor ever since. During the interview, the Cosmos Co-Founder spoke about the passion and the drive behind MultiversX. Speaking about the factor that makes MultiversX stand out from other blockchains, he mentioned their flagship product, xPortal. The “SuperApp” tries to offer users finances, social interactions, and payments, all using a single app. Aggarwal said: I actually think xPortal was a big one. I remember they showed me, it wasn’t called xPortal back then. It had a different name, but when they showed it to me back in 2020. At the time, it was the best mobile wallet I’ve seen. I think the work that they did around the UX and when you log in, you get a username right away. And I think that they were very early on understanding how the UX has to be done. So I think that’s a very big interesting (…).

The team believes just “Web,” or “money,” is a better message for the users. Aggarwal agrees with the message, which heavily focuses on adoption: I think the users don’t care about how the technology works. I think they care about what it does, but also they want to know, telling someone something is a cryptocurrency is not what matters, what matters is telling them it’s secure from hacks or that it’s private. That’s what matters, right? You have to sell the features that cryptocurrency gives you without necessarily having to know (the technology).

19122791,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=556252,1697828448,"Bitcoin Knocks At The Door Of $30,000, But Can Break Happen?","Bitcoin has approached the $30,000 mark with a sharp rally today, but on-chain data suggests the level could provide some major resistance. 1.49 Million Addresses Bought Around The $30,000 Level According to data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, the most significant potential resistance for BTC is at the current levels. The “resistance” here refers to not the technical resistance, but rather the on-chain one. From the on-chain perspective, levels are defined as resistance/support on the basis of the concentration of investors/addresses who bought at said levels. The below chart shows what the distribution of the holders looks like right now across the various levels of the asset: The data for the various on-chain resistance and support levels | Source: IntoTheBlock Generally, whenever the price of the asset retests the cost basis of an investor, they may become more likely to show some kind of move. If this retest happens from below, that is, the holder had been in losses prior to this, they might be tempted to sell at break-even. Related Reading: Wait For Bitcoin At $20,000? This Analyst Says No On the other hand, a decline in the price towards their acquisition price may lead to them buying more of the asset, as they might think that if these same levels proved to be profitable earlier, they could do so again in the near future. The thicker the band of investors who have their cost basis inside a specific price range, the more pronounced effects like these would be. Thus, such ranges above the price could be looked at as sources of resistance, while those below may serve as support. As is visible in the above graph, the $29,800 to $30,700 range is particularly rich with addresses right now. To be more particular, about 1.49 million addresses bought their coins here. Naturally, this means that Bitcoin could find it troubling to cross above this range, as it has already happened throughout the past year. “At the same time, 73% of Bitcoin addresses are currently in profit,” notes IntoTheBlock, as the ranges below all have thick green bands currently. While the range will be hard to clear, at least strong support below means the cryptocurrency could keep up the retests until eventually it can find a break. If BTC can indeed clear the range, it shouldn’t have much resistance at higher levels, as not many investors have their cost basis there. One positive sign for the current rally could be the fact that it’s not driven by the derivatives side, as an analyst has pointed out on X. The value of the metric has been going down in recent days | Source: @jimmyvs24 on X In the above chart, the data for the ratio between the Bitcoin open interest and market cap is displayed. The “open interest” here is a measure of the total amount of BTC contracts open on the futures market. Related Reading: This Bullish Divergence Is Once Again Forming For Bitcoin, Rally Soon?

42409554,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcKHpI,1697827765,How Economic Policy and Geopolitical Uncertainty Could Affect Crypto Markets,"In the ever-evolving landscape of cryptocurrency markets, 2023 has proven to be a year of formidable challenges. As central banks respond to inflationary pressures with rapid interest rate hikes, and geopolitical tensions cast shadows of uncertainty, the cryptocurrency world finds itself at a crossroads.  In this article, we delve into the critical factors influencing the trajectory of cryptocurrency markets: tightening monetary policies, the resurgence of the U.S. dollar, and the lingering specter of inflation. We also examine the evolving role of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, in the context of global finance and stability.  Johnny Louey is a research analyst at LTP. This article is part of CoinDesk's State of Crypto Week, sponsored by Chainalysis.  The graph below illustrates the impact of quantitative tightening by the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank in 2023. Quantitative tightening involves the selling of Treasury securities by central banks, which leads to an upward push on yields. This upward pressure on treasury yields is exacerbated by the implementation of aggressive interest rate hikes. Consequently, these yields have reached their peak levels for the year.  With long-dated treasury yields surging above 4%, capital is flowing out of riskier assets like cryptocurrencies and into these safer alternatives, strengthening the U.S. dollar and reducing demand and liquidity in the cryptocurrency markets.  Record Treasury bond yields, observed since 2008, and the steadfast strengthening of the U.S. dollar since July have exerted downward pressure not only on equities but also on cryptocurrencies. The market correction that started in July has been broad-based, coinciding with the DXY (a measure of the dollar’s value relative to other currencies) surging to a yearly high.     Following several bank crises in March 2023, the Fed implemented the Bank Treasury Facility Program (BTFP) to provide support to banks grappling with the devaluation of their treasury holdings and a crunch in liquidity. This measure has helped alleviate the liquidity crisis. Currently, the Federal Reserve's future course remains uncertain as there have been no indications of a pause in Quantitative Tightening or any plans to cut interest rates. Therefore, the lingering concern now revolves around inflation.  The graph below depicts the notable increase in both U.S. gas prices and crude oil prices, reaching their highest levels of the year.  While the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict hasn't disrupted oil supplies, concerns remain. Oil analyst Reza Falakshahi has cautioned that further escalation could interfere with critical transport routes like the Strait of Hormuz, through which more than a third of global seaborne oil exports pass daily. Any substantial supply shocks from conflicts affecting major oil chokepoints could perpetuate inflation and compel central banks to maintain aggressive interest rate hikes worldwide to combat rising consumer prices.  Presently, the state of the cryptocurrency markets reveals a decline in aggregate trading volumes since the year's outset, reflecting reduced risk appetite among both institutional and retail investors.  Several factors  The decline in trading volume can indeed be attributed to a combination of factors.  First, the intensified crackdowns and charges by the SEC against the cryptocurrency industry have created a sense of regulatory uncertainty, causing some market participants to adopt a more cautious approach and reduce their exposure.  Second, the implementation of restrictive monetary policies has led to a capital outflow from the riskier cryptocurrency markets to safer financial instruments.  Lastly, the presence of growing geopolitical uncertainties has created risk aversion, prompting investors to reduce their exposure to potentially immature assets like cryptocurrencies.  While some argue that bitcoin may eventually function as a store of value similar to gold, it has yet to establish itself as a universally accepted safe-haven asset class. Increasing institutional adoption for cryptocurrencies globally has led to bitcoin speculation outweighing mainstream usage as a store of value.  Bitcoin's demand seems primarily driven by speculative activity rather than fundamentals-based investment behavior, as evidenced by the significant dominance of derivatives trading over spot trading on cryptocurrency exchanges (the average derivatives trading volume is approximately four times that of spot trading volume in 2023). Recent price surges have been predominantly fueled by retail fervor and volatility plays, rather than stable institutional demand. Bitcoin's potential as a broad-based safe haven remains uncertain without universally recognized regulations and use cases akin to traditional currencies and stores of value.  In the short term, macroeconomic and geopolitical factors suppressing speculative flows are expected to continue limiting cryptocurrency market activity and volatility. The SEC has repeatedly delayed high-profile Bitcoin ETF applications, obstructing mainstream adoption paths. Regulatory approval is crucial for Bitcoin to become an institutional investment vehicle and a true safe-haven asset for global investors. Widespread institutional recognition and participation are essential for reducing reliance on speculative flows and enhancing its viability as a portfolio diversifier during periods of volatility.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Johnny Louey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/10/20/how-economic-policy-and-geopolitical-uncertainty-could-affect-crypto-markets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/602a032227259a307673ce075d23fdad159cabb9-1024x683.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42409536,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcKGyO,1697827483,Ripple Is on a Winning Streak (but the Game Isn't Yet Won),"Three strikes. But is the SEC out?  Yesterday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) dismissed its own case against Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Executive Chairman Christian Larsen. This is the third recent win for Ripple, the firm closely associated with XRP, in its multi-year legal battle with the securities watchdog.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Garlinghouse and Larsen were called “significant security holders” in the SEC’s original lawsuit, filed in 2020 (before Gary Genlser was in his seat as Chairman), which accused the company and principal executives of selling over $1.3 billion in an “unregistered, ongoing digital asset securities offering” of XRP. Further, Garlinghouse and Larsen personally “effected” about $600 million in illicit securities sales, it said.  To say the SEC suit has been a stain on Ripple is an understatement. In the immediate weeks after the suit was filed, nearly all U.S. exchanges delisted XRP. Ripple’s relationships with service providers seemed to suffer, and CEO Garlinghouse began to intimate the firm, founded in 2013 in San Francisco, would relocate abroad.  For a while, it seemed like Ripple may not even survive. The firm was flush enough (thank you programmatic sales, bay-bee), but no one knew what would result from what is still, arguably, the most significant regulatory action taken against a crypto company to date. Firms like Telegram and EOS were sued, they settled and were given “slaps on the wrist” (relative to amount of money involved).  But Ripple decided to fight the civil charges, which could have meant a big win or devastating loss. And it’s likely thankful it did take matters to court, at least at the moment amid a bit of a winning streak.  See also: XRP Registers Biggest Single-Day Gain in 3 Months After SEC Drops Charges Against Ripple's Leaders  The first and most significant legal victory for Ripple was tremendous, even if it was partial: Judge Analisa Torres found that Ripple had not violated existing securities laws by selling XRP to exchanges and giving retail buyers a chance to invest, but it did break the law when selling tokens directly to institutional investors.  Ripple also won recently when Judge Torres blocked the SEC’s requests for an “interlocutory appeal” — a way to speed up the trial process by appealing a particular court decision while other aspects of the case are ongoing — and stay of the trial.  It’s likely this most recent win, in the SEC dropping its case against Garlinghouse and Larsen, is meant also to speed up the judicial process. The two were set to go to trial in the spring, which reportedly would have locked up the SEC’s ability to appeal Judge Torres’ decision about institutional investors.  So, rather than wait for the conclusion of that trial, the SEC decided to throw in the towel. That’s the theory, at least — the SEC’s press release didn’t provide much of an explanation and the office hasn’t responded to a request from CoinDesk for comment.  However, the SEC also voluntarily dismissed the case with prejudice, meaning it cannot be filed again. For some, these two words signal a lot. Not only is the executives’ trial completely and permanently over, but “prejudice” tends to come up only when a judge sees the case as frivolous or a matter that could be resolved outside of court.  In either case, whether the SEC dismissed its lawsuit to appeal a different legal matter quicker, or because it knew it didn’t have a case against Ripple’s executives, the recent trial updates don’t look good for the SEC. Just optically-speaking, the once fierce and feared watchdog that sought to patrol all of crypto under its purview is now getting its nose swatted in court.  And this is exactly what the judicial system was designed for. While legislators in Congress pass laws (or in the case of crypto, delay passing anything) and executive agencies enforce them, the judicial system is meant to act as a check on both. So far, Judge Torres seems to suggest existing securities laws are sufficient to rule on crypto, and the SEC has been overzealous.  Of course, the legal battle isn’t exactly over, and decisions helpful to Ripple are still a matter that can be appealed. What happens next is Ripple and the SEC will fight over how much the crypto startup needs to pay in restitution for its $700-plus million in illicit XRP sales. While almost certainly a weight off Garlinghouse's shoulders, pretending that the SEC somehow capitulated or threw in the game is false.

XRP Milestone Could Spark A Bullish Run Due to XRP’s recent milestone, Wall Street expert Linda Jones believes that the token is very bullish following the increase in interest from institutional investors toward the XRP market. Linda Jones took to her official X (formerly Twitter) handle to express her viewpoint on XRP’s future. She noted that XRP will probably experience a bullish trend since the approval of derivative contracts enables institutional investors to trade the token with significant capital. Related Reading: Bitcoin Maximalist Calls Ethereum ‘Garbage’, Here’s Why Linda further highlighted that institutional investors’ adoption is more likely to trigger a bullish trend for XRP than with just retail investors. According to the expert, Wall Street firms, notably hedge funds, are drawn to derivative trading because it gives them the chance to take advantage of price changes in digital assets to maximize profits. Coinbase approving perpetual futures contracts for trading XRP means: 1) XRP is very bullish. If XRP’s price was not going to fluctuate or change a lot, no one would be interested in trading it. Futures contracts allow for maximum leverage and can lead to outsized profits (or… — Linda P. Jones (@LindaPJones) October 18, 2023 In the post, Linda anticipates that leading investment firms could be investigating jurisdictions that are familiar with hedge funds and offshore funds, such as the Cayman Islands or Bermuda. The introduction of institutional investors to the XRP market covers a larger connection for the digital asset’s market stability and adoption. This marks a major step for the digital asset. It indicates a growing interest and adoption of XRP in the midst of institutional investors and an increase in investment in XRP might trigger the digital asset’s overall market dynamics since institutional investors are attracted to volatile assets like XRP. The increased interest from institutional investors in the token may also trigger an increase in demand for the token from several types of investors including retail investors and businesses. Linda Jones On The Ripple IPO Linda Jones has previously commented on XRP and the potential value if Ripple were to undergo an initial public offering (IPO) and become a publicly traded company. Jones compared Ripple going public to the valuation at which Coinbase went public and presented a possible $107 billion valuation for the company. With such a valuation, the crypto firm’s stock price would be $600. The Wall Street veteran also believes that Ripple should be considered a high-value company such as Nvidia or Apple because it has what it takes. Related Reading: FTX Billion-Dollar Fraud: Expert Figures Out Where The Missing $9 Billion Went If Ripple were to be as highly valued as Jones posited, then there would be an obvious impact on the XRP price.

19118185,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=556275,1697821233,Bulls Thrust Solana To $25 – What Traders Should Expect Next,"Solana (SOL) has witnessed an impressive resurgence, climbing to $25.46, marking a remarkable 10% rally in the past 24 hours. This surge is part of a broader trend, with SOL’s price experiencing a seven-day surge of 19.4%, further solidifying its position as one of the prominent players in the crypto sphere. Solana’s remarkable journey to its current valuation is a testament to its resilience, especially considering the tumultuous events it weathered nearly a year ago. In November, the cryptocurrency faced a severe setback due to the FTX implosion saga, which sent SOL plummeting to $8. However, Solana has emerged from the ashes, and the crypto community is taking notice of its remarkable recovery. Related Reading: Why Is Bitcoin SV (BSV) Up 63% Today? Find Out Here Solana Technical Signals Point To A Bullish Momentum The recent surge in SOL’s price can be attributed to several key factors. One notable driver is the increasing network activity and substantial growth within the Solana ecosystem, particularly in the realm of decentralized finance (DeFi). This snippet is from my “Is Solana Dead” video. Despite the FTX fallout, $SOL still has a lot going on behind the scenes! If you want to see the whole video, its on my channel, I will post the link on my X profile! pic.twitter.com/De6j5aNGxx — Frankie Candles (@Frankie_Candles) October 19, 2023 The crypto world was offered a glimpse of this growth in a video shared by @Frankie_Candles, which shed light on the vibrant activity happening “behind the scenes” in the Solana ecosystem. Notably, the total value locked in Solana’s DeFi smart contracts has seen a significant upswing, soaring from $210 million in January 2023 to $331 million in October, as reported by DefiLlama. SOL TVL. Source: DefiLlama Furthermore, Solana bulls have reinforced the bullish outlook by successfully maintaining support at the $25 mark and breaching the upper dotted falling trendline. The presence of a buy signal is often considered an encouraging sign for traders, reinforcing confidence in the cryptocurrency’s upward trajectory. One key technical aspect to watch out for is the potential for a “golden cross.” A golden cross occurs when a short-term moving average crosses above a long-term moving average, typically signaling a possible bullish breakout. This could be a pivotal moment for Solana, as it may provide further confirmation of its bullish momentum. SOL has a market cap of $11.26 billion as of today. Chart: TradingView.com SOL Neckline Resistance Another significant element to monitor on the charts is the possibility of Solana conquering the neckline resistance once again. The neckline resistance represents a critical point that acts as a threshold for bullish momentum. Historically, breaking through this level has been a precursor to sustained uptrends, suggesting the potential for further gains in the near future. If Solana manages to achieve this, it will mark a strong resurgence, reaffirming its position as a strong force in the ever-evolving cryptocurrency landscape.

Formerly known as Elrond, the project rebranded in 2022 to focus on the Metaverse, one of the hottest trends in crypto. Related Reading: xDay 2023 Day 2: Google And MultiversX Join Hands, How The Big Tech Giant Will Support The Community During the event, the head of product for MultiversX’s native “SuperApp” xPortal, Sergius Biris, unveiled new features to expand the ecosystem. The project aims to onboard new users to the network by providing social interactions, a bridge with other blockchains, and more to compete with Elon Muk. xPortal Goes After Elon Musk’s Ambitions Since last year, when Musk acquired Twitter (rebranded as “X”), the entrepreneur has progressively tried to turn it into something more. The social media app allows users to receive tips, subscribe to their favorite content, and interact with non-fungible tokens. These features highlight the relevance for users to operate with a single hub. MultiversX and xPortal want to compete with Elon Musk by providing users access to these and other features announced during the conference, such as gamification, access to the metaverse, and NFTs to provide a “multifaceted digital experience.” In contrast with X and Musk’s attempts, the team behind xPortal believes they have a critical advantage: their product is live and has over 1.5 million users already transecting and interacting with the MultiversX ecosystem. Moreover, MultiversX has a vision to remove all friction from onboarding their ecosystem. Thus, xPortal announced a new fiat to crypto on and off-ramping capability and a feature enabling users to swap their tokens. For European users, xPortal will enable peer-to-peer fiat payments with the traditional banking system, SEPA and SWIFT, earlier next year. During the conference, Biris stated: The features launched today, most notably the debit cards, were a long time in the making. Today’s launch elevates xPortal from a crypto wallet to a financial super app. We thus created a bridge to an interconnected future where the lines between crypto, fiat, and emerging technologies like AI dissolve, bringing an unparalleled user experience. The new features also included tools for developers and creators to leverage the MultiversX ecosystem. The xPortal app already allows them to launch their products for users to download quickly, similar to Apple’s Appstore and Google’s PlayStore. Turning Web3 And Crypto Into “Money” The conference has been conducted under a key vision: users want to leverage the technology, so crypto projects need to focus on security, scaling, and making accessible products. Rather than “Web3” or “Web4,” xPortal is about turning crypto into “money” available for anyone. Related Reading: xDay 2023 Day 1: How MultiversX Is Bridging The Metaverse, AI, And Blockchain Under Ecosystem Sergiu Biris, Head of Product at xPortal, spoke to us during the event in an exclusive interview and shared the project’s vision: They have to be able to do anything, whether it’s crypto or fiat, they don’t have to think about Blockchain is this, blockchain is not money. We are trying to dissolve those barriers between crypto and fiat because in our vision, money, it’s just money. And that’s why we want to make it easier for anyone to do whatever they need in terms of financial needs through the app. Cover image from MultiversX, chart from Tradingview",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | EGLD,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/xday-2023-elon-musks-x-competitor-xportal-unveils-rival-features/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/19115929.jpeg

The six – Shaileshkumar Goyani, Brijeshkumar Patel, Hirenkumar Patel, Naineshkumar Patel, Nileshkumar Patel and Raju Patel – operated without an appropriate money transmitting license in New York, according to the filing.  The details, disclosed in the unsealed affidavit of an FBI agent seeking the individuals' arrest, reveal that between July 2021 and September 2023 they conducted the illegal business by using the darknet to convert bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies into cash.  The U.S. Magistrate judge has granted the conditional release of at least one of the people named, Naineshkumar Patel, according to a court document.  The filing cites an unidentified co-conspirator as saying that at least some clients ""made money by selling drugs"" and that the wealthiest clients ""were hackers."" The co-conspirator told an undercover officer that he had made approximately $30 million over three years through the exchange of cash for virtual currency.  On Feb. 7, 2023, law enforcement arrested an individual who had been mailing packages of cash on behalf of the unnamed co-conspirator from a post office in Westchester County, New York. The arrested individual would later become a confidential source and for the next eight months cooperate with law enforcement in approximately 80 controlled pick-ups of cash totaling approximately $15 million.  The filing has photographic and video surveillance evidence of the accused in the act alleging that the defendants are not registered and do not have a licensed money-transmitting business, which is required in New York.

""I’m quite hopeful that these applications will be granted, if only because they should be granted under the law,"" Grewal said in an interview with CNBC on Friday.  A spot bitcoin ETF will follow the price of bitcoin rather than the prices of bitcoin futures, giving investors direct exposure to the largest digital cryptocurrency without owning it themselves. The optimism surrounding a potential spot bitcoin ETF was started earlier this year when TradFi giants like BlackRock filed for spot ETF with the SEC.  If a spot bitcoin ETF is approved, the asset managers will need to buy, own and store the digital assets for its clients, similar to a physically backed gold ETF, potentially boosting the price of the underlying cryptocurrencies and the whole sector.  The bitcoin price could rise to between $42,000 and $56,000 if the BlackRock ETF is approved, according to crypto services provider Matrixport. Such bullish price action would also help crypto-linked stocks such as Coinbase, MicroStrategy (MSTR) and miners including Marathon (MARA), Riot Platforms (RIOT).  Grewal didn't speculate when the approvals will come but said that given some of the key TradFi firms have applied for spot bitcoin ETFs, it is only a matter of time.  ""I think that the firms that have stepped forward with robust proposals for these products and services are among some of the biggest blue chips in financial services,” Grewal told CNBC. “So that, I think, suggests that we will see progress there in short order,” he added.

Investor worries about FTX selling tokens were overblown, an IntoTheBlock analyst noted.  Rising activity on the Solana network, massive influx into digital asset funds and a recent tech upgrade also likely contributed to the rally.  Solana [SOL] is higher by another 11% on Friday, continuing to outperform the rest of the crypto market and defying worries of a potential fire sale by bankrupt crypto exchange FTX.  With today’s advance, the cryptocurrency is now higher by more than 26% this week, CoinDesk data shows. Crypto leaders bitcoin [BTC] and ether [ETH] were ahead by 10% and 3%, respectively, over the same time frame. The broad crypto market-proxy CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) advanced 8%.  ""This is some of the strongest buying activity we’ve seen since July,"" David Shuttleworth, research partner at Anagram and former managing director at Binance Labs, told CoinDesk.  Why has SOL’s price rallied?  Friday's gain adds to SOL's remarkable comeback as one of the best-performing digital assets this year with a 170% year-to-date rise. This after Solana’s future was in doubt at the end of 2022 following the spectacular fall of Sam Bankman-Fried – one of the ecosystem’s top supporters and investors.  Additionally, a U.S. bankruptcy court last month granted the FTX-Alameda estate permission to liquidate its massive crypto holdings, which included a $1.16 billion solana stash as of late August, spurring fears about SOL tokens being dumped en masse on the market.  ""The Alameda FUD turned out to be less severe than anticipated,"" IntoTheBlock head of research Lucas Outumuro told CoinDesk.  Last week, the FTX estate staked, or locked up roughly 5.5 million SOL worth $122 million at the time, easing investor sentiment.  Outumuro also noted SOL's technical breakout against ETH, which could have contributed to the rally.  Investors, meanwhile, have flocked to Solana-focused funds, asset manager CoinShares reported, with $24 million of net inflows last week. It was the largest weekly influx since March 2022, as SOL continued to ""assert itself as the altcoin of choice,"" CoinShares head of research James Butterfill said.  The Solana blockchain enjoyed increasing network activity over the past weeks, digital asset manager 21Shares researchers noted Thursday, in a report citing blockchain data by The Block.  The analysis also noted that Solana recently activated a tech upgrade that reduced validator hardware requirements, and added optional zero-knowledge-compatible encryption for transactions.

42409539,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcKH50,1697814470,Unraveling the Dark Side of Crypto,"At the Financial Times’ recent Crypto and Digital Assets Summit, the director of the FBI’s National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team (NCET), Eun Young Choi, acknowledged that “We are seeing cryptocurrency and digital assets really touch every aspect of criminal activity we investigate.” This includes illicit actors across a very broad spectrum of activity, everything from ransomware to narcotics smuggling to rogue states to terrorist financing. Cryptocurrency is now increasingly the preferred means of carrying out their dirty business.  This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's State of Crypto Week, sponsored by Chainalysis. Evan Kohlmann is the CEO of Cloudburst Technologies, a New York-based startup venture aimed at detecting and thwarting digital currency fraud.  The reason these actors have settled on cryptocurrency as a medium is hardly difficult to divine: digital currencies offer unprecedented pseudonymity and cash-out opportunities that simply do not exist within the highly-regulated SWIFT banking system. People can use crypto networks without any personal identifiers attached to their “accounts.” By building the Web3 financial universe, we have moved from a world with nearly perfect data to almost none. Nor has the open source nature of the blockchain been in and of itself enough to prevent market corruption.  Currently, without the use of expensive blockchain tools that many countries and agencies cannot afford, investigators are mostly relegated to running searches for anonymous digital wallet addresses in the blockchain and hoping to find transaction matches. There are a variety of reliable blockchain explorers available such as Chainalysis, TRM Labs, Elliptic and CipherTrace – but even if one finds a match through such a search, transaction data can be an awfully shallow pool if you are looking to answer the kind of critical questions that typically underscore a criminal investigation: the who, what, how, where and why.  Many of the critical pieces that can help unravel a criminal scheme and identify the personas involved can be gleaned from traditional Web2 cyberintelligence sources, including mediums like Telegram and Discord  In the words of Coinbase’s Special Investigations Team, “Unless you own an address yourself, it is very difficult to say with absolute certainty who an address is owned by. This is why it’s more fitting to consider blockchain analytics more of an art than science.”  Indeed, the blockchain is merely a ledger receipt, and to properly address these attribution questions other sources of data are required. If “ultimate attribution” is not possible via ledger analysis, “research shifts into the world of open source intelligence (OSINT)” — from which the investigations team at Coinbase has noted “much can be learned.” Plainly stated, illicit actors don’t organize and plan their activities on the blockchain, they do it in the deep and dark web.  Many of the critical pieces that can help unravel a criminal scheme and identify the personas involved can be gleaned from traditional Web2 cyberintelligence sources, including mediums like Telegram and Discord. There are chat rooms specifically dedicated to crypto fraud on those platforms with millions of actors present in them, illuminating in some small way the scale of the problem.  The challenge is in monitoring all those conversations simultaneously, parsing the actionable data in real time, discounting false positives and reliably locating the actors. Given that platforms like Telegram are specifically popular among fraud organizer, in part, due to their perceived security and anonymity protections, this isn’t a simple task by any means.  See also: The Crypto-Surveillance Capitalism Connection | Money Reimagined  Nonetheless, a continued reliance on blockchain data alone for conducting cryptocurrency investigations creates major knowledge gaps and leaves both the public and private sector flat-footed and shockingly blind to major contemporary financial risks. Threat intelligence should not be relegated to telling us only after the fact about avoidable risks, and verifying an individual’s involvement in illicit online activity should not be narrowly predicated on knowing their precise digital wallet address.  Such an existential question should be able to be resolved with a real name, an address and a phone number – not any different from the traditional financial universe. This isn’t a challenge that fundamentally depends on new regulation from Congress, just ensuring that the appropriate investigative tools are in the hands of those tasked with financial monitoring and enforcement. Indeed, there is a potential vast future market for cryptocurrencies among the broader public — once those currencies shake their unwanted reputation as being a means for money laundering, scams and tax fraud.

19113724,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=556231,1697814005,Shiba Inu Revival? Here’s Why A Resurgence May Be Imminent,"Shiba Inu (SHIB) has been displaying a bearish structure accompanied by a noticeable capital outflow, leading to a plunge in its value. Despite the prevailing technical indicators, there is a lingering possibility of a short-term range formation. At present, the critical resistance on the charts is identified at $0.000007. Notably, this level experienced a brief shift to support earlier in the week, but the bullish momentum was ultimately unable to sustain its grip. As of the latest update, the current SHIB price on CoinGecko hovers at $0.00000692, with a moderate 24-hour rally of 3.5% and a modest seven-day gain of 1.2%. The recent descent below the trendline support does not necessarily invalidate its strength. Frequently observed in technical analysis, assets often retest critical support levels to confirm their resilience before any substantial directional shift. If SHIB can promptly reclaim its position above this trendline, it might signal the commencement of a potentially bullish phase. Related Reading: ETH Price Watch: Impact On Price As Traders Ditch Bitcoin On Derivatives Market Shiba Inu: Struggle For Support Analyzing the four-hour chart, the market structure of SHIB took a bearish turn following the decline below the $0.00000693 mark, ultimately reaching the local lows of $0.00000673. Similar market movements were witnessed earlier this month, which led to the plotting of a set of Fibonacci levels. Notably, the 61.8% and 78.6% levels failed to witness a successful H4 trading session closure above them, despite a brief spike to the $0.00000729 mark. In the last 12 hours, SHIB bulls have managed to put a temporary halt to the prevailing bearish momentum, thereby indicating a possibility of a bounce back towards the $0.000007 level. SHIB has a market cap of $4.1 billion today. Chart: TradingView.com Evaluating the moving averages, SHIB currently lies below both its short-term and long-term averages, historically indicating the presence of bearish momentum. However, considering the broader context, this positioning could potentially signify a consolidation phase, setting the stage for an imminent reversal in its trajectory. Potential Impact Of Current Market Trends On SHIB’s Long-term Outlook The recent market trends have raised concerns regarding SHIB’s long-term trajectory, with the bearish structure and substantial capital outflow posing significant challenges for the cryptocurrency. However, market analysts continue to highlight the potential for a short-term range formation despite the persisting technical indicators. As the cryptocurrency grapples with critical resistance levels and the possibility of retesting support, investors remain cautiously optimistic about the potential for a bullish phase.

Source: Coingecko Related Reading: Bitcoin SV Climbs 22% – A Close Look At The Factors Behind The Surge Notably, the recent drop below the trendline support has added to the uncertainty surrounding SHIB’s near-term performance. However, technical analysis suggests that a quick reclaim of the position above this trendline could serve as a crucial indicator for a potential bullish phase. The recent positioning of SHIB below both its short-term and long-term moving averages has raised concerns about the persistence of bearish momentum. However, experts underline the importance of considering the broader context, emphasizing the potential for a consolidation phase that could pave the way for a reversal in SHIB’s market trajectory.

42409543,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcKHLX,1697810969,Crypto Shareholder Requirements Set Out by EU Banking Regulators,"EU watchdogs on Friday issued consultations on a range of issues set to be regulated by the bloc's landmark new crypto law, MiCA.  The proposals cover curbs on ownership, governance and bonuses for crypto companies and their staff.  Crypto company shareholders with a more than 10% stake will be vetted for previous convictions or sanctions under bank-style rules proposed by EU regulators Friday.  The rules come as high-profile crypto industry executives including FTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried, Celsius’ Alex Mashinsky and Binance’s Changpeng “CZ” Zhao fight U.S. charges that they have misled or defrauded customers, or failed to comply with federal securities laws.  New European Union laws known as the Markets in Crypto Assets regulation, MiCA, due to take effect in December 2024, require prospective crypto license holders to show owners and executives have a good reputation. MiCA authorizations – which will allow crypto companies to operate across the 27-nation bloc – can be withdrawn if executives don't meet the grade, added the consultation, which is open for comment until January.  Shareholders and board members of crypto asset service providers “must not have been convicted of offenses relating to money laundering or terrorist financing or of any other offenses that would affect their good repute,” a condition that has to be “maintained at all times,” said the EBA and ESMA, the EU rulemaking agencies responsible for banking and securities markets law.  In other parts of the financial sector, ownership curbs have been used to try and prevent former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi from owning a major shareholding in a bank. Berlusconi, who died earlier this year, had previously been convicted of tax fraud.  Under the planned measures, companies issuing stablecoins – cryptocurrency tied to the value of other assets such as fiat – would also face limits on staff bonuses as regulators seek to imitate controversial banking-sector measures designed to curb excessive risk-taking.",NEUTRAL,없음,EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | BNB,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/10/20/crypto-shareholder-requirements-set-out-by-eu-banking-regulators,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0d8ab384f5877d76e947ba285f6555f344289b47-1152x648.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

BTC, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, has experienced notable increases in value throughout the current week, with the aim of surpassing the significant threshold of $30,000. The cryptocurrency has been influenced by the operations of a spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) as investors continue to await approval to onboard institutional and mainstream exposure to the digital asset. Bitcoin Is Headed For $56,000 Matrixport conducted an analysis in its newly released report, examining the potential effects of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) on the cryptocurrency market, with a specific focus on BTC. Applications for these investment vehicles have gained momentum in recent months, with many now expecting a green light from the SEC. Related Reading: When Will The Bitcoin Bear Market End? US Mega Bank Has The Answer The report draws a parallel close to the $120 billion precious metals ETF industry. If just 10–20% of investors in precious metal ETFs diversified their holdings into Bitcoin ETFs, it would result in an influx of $12b billion to $24 billion into these investment vehicles. According to Matrixport, an approval, particularly a BlackRock Bitcoin ETF application, would see leading stablecoin USDT increase by as much as $50 billion in market cap. This, in turn, would lead to Bitcoin’s price rising to $56,000, with Tether acting as an intermediary facilitating the inflow of investments to BTC. “Our earlier reports analysed the 15,000-strong US registered investor advisor (RIA) community overseeing around $5 trillion. This group holds immense potential, and even a modest 1% allocation recommendation for Bitcoin would usher in around $50 billion in inflows,” the report said. A lesser influx of $24 billion into Tether would see BTC rise to $42,000 in the short term. With BTC currently trading at $29,370 with a market cap of $625.03 billion, this represents an increase of 90% and 43% in both scenarios. BTC readies to break $30,000 | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com What’s Next For BTC? Is A Rally Inevitable? The price of Bitcoin has always reacted to news regarding spot Bitcoin ETFs. Just news of applications from BlackRock, Fidelity, and other investment companies sent BTC surging. Recently, rumors that the SEC had approved BlackRock’s ETF application sent the industry into a frenzy, and $74 million worth of BTC positions were liquidated in just a few minutes. Related Reading: Bitcoin Maximalist Calls Ethereum ‘Garbage’, Here’s Why There’s no denying the amount of capital a spot Bitcoin ETF would unlock for the crypto industry. If approved, a spot Bitcoin ETF could unlock a massive inflow of capital from institutional investors, up to $17.7 trillion from financial institutions. According to Fundstrat co-founder Tom Lee, spot ETFs could push BTC to $150,000 or maybe even further by the end of next year.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will no longer pursue claims against Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse or Executive Chairman Chris Larsen that they aided and abetted the company in violating federal securities laws in its XRP transactions, canceling a trial scheduled for next year and giving the crypto company another victory in the agency’s long-running suit against it while moving the regulator closer to appealing a federal judge’s ruling in the case. According to a filing Thursday afternoon, the parties agreed to voluntarily dismiss the aiding and abetting charges against the two executives with prejudice, which means the changes cannot be filed again. The SEC will continue pursuing its claims against Ripple, the filing said.  Bitcoin crossed the $30,000 mark during the morning hours on Friday, extending its weekly gains to over 11% as bullish sentiment around a possible spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval in the U.S. gained momentum. Tokens formed by the forking of Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Bitcoin SV (BSV) jumped as much as 26% to lead gains among alternative tokens in a sign of possible irrational exuberance. Several ETF providers amended their filings over multiple days in the past week alongside pressure on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to soften its stance on a bitcoin ETF approval. XRP logged its best daily percentage gain in three months as the SEC dropped securities-violations charges against fintech company Ripple’s top leaders. XRP, the world’s fifth-largest digital asset, rose 6.5% to 52 cents, jumping to a high of 53 cents before pulling back to 51 cents at press time, CoinDesk data shows.  FTX’s general counsel “never approved” the crypto exchange lending customer funds to sister firm Alameda Research, he told the jury on day 12 of Sam Bankman-Fried’s criminal fraud trial. Can Sun, the general counsel at FTX from August 2021 to the time of the exchange’s collapse in November 2022, said “absolutely not” when asked Thursday whether he signed off on Alameda’s use of FTX customer funds. Sun testified he believed FTX customers’ funds were kept segregated from the company’s funds, based on conversations he’d had with Bankman-Fried. Assistant U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon walked Sun through FTX’s terms of service and other public statements supporting the Department of Justice’s thesis that FTX misappropriated customer funds.  Chart of The Day  The chart shows bitcoin has crossed above resistance at $28,754, stemming from the June 2021 low.  The latest breakout might be more long-lasting than those in April and June, thanks to the ETF narrative.

19107585,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=556220,1697803258,XRP Dominance Reveals Start Of Next Parabolic Price Move,"Crypto analyst Jaydee recently took to X (formerly Twitter), sharing another intriguing chart of XRP. The analyst presented the 2-month XRP dominance chart spanning from 2014 till today, shedding light on the cryptocurrency’s historical and potential future price actions. This examination brings to focus a falling trend line and a horizontal resistance line, which showcases a critical XRP dominance level at 2.62% that could be key for the price’s next parabolic move. XRP Dominance Sits Just Below Key Level Delving into the historical performance, the chart showcases moments when the token experienced rapid increases and furious drops in terms of crypto market dominance. There was a period where XRP underwent a staggering 39x price jump, reaching $0.39 in just 56 days in 2017. Shortly after, another surge saw the digital asset climb 17x within 28 days, marking its value at $3.31. Both times, the dominance was rejected at the yellow 5.5-year trend line. This resistance line has consistently acted as a major barrier to XRP’s dominance in the crypto market. Every approach or touch of this line led to significant price actions toward the downside. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts XRP Price To Hit $100: Here’s How To Become A Millionaire Remarkably, the cryptocurrency’s price experienced a similar situation from 2015 to 2017 when the dominance was also held below a falling trend line for more than two years. However, the breakout of this trend signaled a massive price surge as XRP dominance rose from merely 1% to above 30% in just four months in 2017. Fast-forward to today, the cryptocurrency could be in a similar situation as in 2017. It has breached the trend and is moving beyond the red trend line. However, instead of an instant surge as in 2017, XRP’s dominance now contends with the pivotal 2.62% mark. Related Reading: ‘Extra Bullish’ On XRP? Crypto Analyst Pinpoints The Perfect Timing According to the analyst’s chart, it’s currently at 2.55%, narrowly missing the critical level. Notably, over the past 14 months, dominance hasn’t achieved a close above 2.62% on the bi-monthly chart. However, if it does surpass this threshold, it might signal the onset of the next parabolic ascent, as outlined by Jaydee. Currently hitting the yellow resistance line. If we can have a full 2-month candle close above the yellow resistance line, expect the next parabolic move! Is 2024 the year? Weekly Chart: When ‘Moon’? Jaydee shared another chart on X (formerly Twitter) today, stating with regards to the weekly XRP/USD chart: “Still creating higher high (HH) in Price while lower low (LL) in RSI and SRSI on the WEEKLY, while bouncing off the 2-year trend line.” From this, he discerns three key takeaways before XRP can “moon.” First, the cryptocurrency needs to gather momentum. He suggests that it needs to break past the $0.54 mark, at least on the daily chart. Second, the Stochastic RSI (SRSI) for the weekly timeframe should cross the 20-level, indicating potential for a bullish move.

The filing alleges Lubin, a co-founder of the Ethereum blockchain, stripped ConsenSys AG, also known as Mesh, of its main assets – including crypto wallet provider MetaMask – and transferred them to ConsenSys Software Inc. (CSI), incorporated in Delaware, without bringing over the ex-employees as equity holders.  ""Lubin promised that these early employees would receive equity in ConsenSys,"" the filing alleges. ""Then he broke his word. In the process, he violated his legal commitments and duties. While Lubin got rich, Plaintiffs got nothing.""  The filing said the Brooklyn-based firm, which develops products on Ethereum, has raised $726.7 million from investors at a valuation of more than $7 billion. But instead of equity, the former employees said, they now hold ""virtually worthless pieces of paper."" They were robbed of their expectation to share in ConsenSys' success for their ""increased risk, lower salaries, and foundational efforts as early employees,"" the filing alleges.  The U.S.-based ConsenSys dismissed the allegations.  ""After two years of getting nowhere with their frivolous claims against ConsenSys Mesh in a Swiss court, plaintiffs now believe their meritless claims stand a better chance of yielding a pay day if they game U.S. courts and entangle ConsenSys Software and other unrelated parties in litigation,"" a company spokesperson said. ""We fully expect that the plaintiffs, who were never employees of ConsenSys Software, will soon find this gambit is another fruitless attempt to enrich themselves from the success of others.""

However, potential fallout from overstretched bullish positioning in technology stocks may put on the brakes.  ""Long big tech,"" or bullish bets on technology companies with large market capitalization, is the most crowded trade, according to Bank of America's (BofA) October survey of fund managers released Tuesday.  BofA surveyed 295 market participants with a total of $736 billion in assets under management. The survey was conducted from Oct 6-12.  A crowded trade is the preferred by many investors and often results complacency about the position's ability to generate profits. In such cases, even a slight dent in investor confidence can lead to sudden, large-scale unwinding of positions and disruptive market action.  Such an event concerning the crowded long-big-tech trade may have a negative impact on the crypto market, especially on ether (ETH), which many consider analogous to a technology stock. Bitcoin (BTC), in contrast, has been portrayed as digital gold.  ""According to the latest Bank of America Fund Manager Survey, the most crowded trade at the moment is still 'long big tech.'

19105460,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=556241,1697799623,XRP Price Crosses $0.53 But These Factors Suggests Rally Is Far From Over,"The XRP price saw an impressive run over the last day after news broke that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was dropping its lawsuit against Ripple’s executives. This surge carried on into Friday as the altcoin’s price was able to clear the $0.53. Naturally, there has been a pullback from this price level, but whale transactions suggest that the rally may not be over. Crypto Whales Flex Their Buying Power In the last day, crypto whales have been showing their buying power as the price of cryptocurrencies such as XRP saw a recovery. The first indication of this was a number of large USDT transactions that were making their way toward centralized exchanges. Related Reading: XRP Price Prediction: Rare Bent Fork Pattern Predicts Explosive 3000% Surge To $15 The first of these reported by whale tracker Whale Alert was $100 million in USDT transferred to Binance. Then two other transactions carrying the same amount of tokens followed suit, all headed for the Binance exchange as well. Another 50 million USDT would make their way to the exchange just a couple of hours later. Then the minting of $1 billion USDT at the Tether Treasury took place as Thursday drew to a close. What followed was a number of transactions carrying USDT in 50 million tranches headed for Binance. The transactions continued into Friday, with the most recent being two hours old, at the time of this writing. XRP remains bullish | Source: XRPUSDT on Tradingview.com What This Means For XRP Price The continuous transfer of stablecoins to centralized exchanges can often signal a willingness to purchase cryptocurrencies. Mostly, these purchases are in Bitcoin but the buying power tends to have a trickle-down effect. Meaning, that as the price of Bitcoin goes up, so will the XRP price. In this case, if whales continue to buy and push the Bitcoin price past $30,000, then the XRP price is likely to follow suit and break the $0.55 resistance while at it. However, the XRP price also faces strong resistance as whales have taken to selling. Related Reading: XRP Price Set For Massive Rally As BlackRock And JPMorgan Make Their Move As Whale Alert shows, there were a number of large XRP transactions headed toward centralized exchanges. The most notable of these are the 32.3 million XRP worth $15.79 million at the time sent to the Bitso exchange, as well as the 31.1 million XRP worth $15.2 headed to the Bitstamp exchange. These whale movements suggest a battle between bulls and bears as they struggle for dominance. But XRP price continues to show strength with 7.44% gains in the last 24 hours, and up 6.94% in the last seven days.

19103432,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=556206,1697796012,Why Is Bitcoin SV (BSV) Up 63% Today? Find Out Here,"Over the course of the past four days, Bitcoin SV (BSV) has witnessed a substantial surge in its price, marking an impressive milestone by reaching its highest point in the last 100 days. Remarkably, within this surge, BSV managed to breach the long-standing $40 horizontal resistance level, which had persisted since the month of July. This recent surge in the price of BSV has sparked considerable interest among cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors. It signifies a notable shift in the market dynamics, as BSV’s price trajectory has taken a positive turn after months of relative stagnation. At the time of writing, BSV was trading at $53.84, up 27% in the last 24 hours, and erecting a solid 63% rally in the last seven days, data from crypto market tracker Coingecko shows. Related Reading: ETH Price Watch: Impact On Price As Traders Ditch Bitcoin On Derivatives Market Bitcoin SV 100-Day High Signals Renewed Market Interest The fact that BSV has achieved a 100-day high is indicative of a more sustained and potentially significant upward trend. This suggests that the cryptocurrency has garnered renewed interest from traders and investors, possibly driven by fundamental developments or market sentiment. Bitcoin SV (BSV), which originated in 2018 as a hard fork of Bitcoin Cash with the aim of increasing scalability through larger block sizes, has experienced a notable revival. Following an extended duration of rather stagnant price fluctuations, BSV has had a substantial spike of 57% subsequent to reaching a nadir in August. This resurgence in price enabled BSV to overcome a crucial resistance level which had been a significant barrier since July. BSV has a market cap of $1.04 billion at the time of writing. Chart: TradingView.com The recent surge in cryptocurrency prices is mainly driven by the widespread excitement surrounding the potential approval of a Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. This sentiment was further bolstered when the SEC chose not to appeal the legal case involving Grayscale. However, the spike in BSV’s price can be attributed to a misleading article, which falsely claimed that the SEC had anticipated the launch of the iShares Bitcoin Trust, briefly causing Bitcoin’s value to rise to around $30,000 before rapidly declining. Binance Relaunches BSV, Leading To Price Surge Meanwhile, Binance – one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges – relaunched BSV through a USD-M BSV Perpetual Contract with 50x leverage on Friday, resulting in a 30% surge in BSV’s price and over $500,000 in short position liquidations, as reported by Coinglass. Related Reading: Bitcoin SV Climbs 22% – A Close Look At The Factors Behind The Surge This move comes after a period of turmoil that began on April 15, 2019, when Binance delisted BSV because of a dispute between Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao and BSV creator Craig Wright, primarily over Wright’s claim to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the anonymous founder of Bitcoin, which resulted in alleged attacks on critics of his identity on Twitter. Bitcoin SV’s recent price surge, pushing it to monthly highs, could propel it towards the yearly peak near $57, as it broke key moving averages in the $33-35 range and has been on an upward trend since August lows at $26. Notably, BSV has faced strong resistance from its 200-day moving average since early 2021. (This site’s content should not be construed as investment advice. Investing involves risk.

Thursday ended early after just two witnesses – former FTX General Counsel Can Sun and Third Point's Robert Boroujerdi – testified briefly. We won't be back in the courthouse at 500 Pearl Street until next Thursday, Oct. 26, when we'll resume our normal analyses. Instead, today, CoinDesk's SBF trial team is proud to present: Our favorite quotes.  You're reading The SBF Trial, a CoinDesk newsletter bringing you daily insights from inside the courtroom where Sam Bankman-Fried will try to stay out of prison. Want to receive it directly? Sign up here.  ""Believe it or not, we're just about ready."" – Judge Lewis Kaplan, after a brief delay pulling prospective jurors in. (10/03/23)  ""How close is the relationship between you and one of the –"" ""It's my husband's co-worker."" – Judge Kaplan, questioning a prospective juror about whether she really needed to fly to a wedding in Colombia. (10/03/23)  ""I don't understand the cryptocurrency, how it works … [W]hen the case first started, my son was the one that brought it to my attention. He did try to explain to me how it works. I don't actually still understand how cryptocurrency works."" – A prospective juror explaining his familiarity with the case. (10/03/23)  ""And just so we're all complete, who's Tom Brady?"" – Judge Kaplan, making sure the GOAT was on the record. (10/04/23)  ""I don't think there is anybody in the room who has never seen [a Toyota Corolla]."" – Judge Kaplan, in one of the first of his many slap-downs on lines of questioning he deemed unnecessary. (10/05/23)  ""It felt like a dorm in the sense that I was living with others but not like a dorm in the sense that it was very luxurious."" – Former FTX developer Adam Yedidia, describing his living conditions at an FTX apartment in the Bahamas, where he lived with several other executives. (10/05/23)  ""The first time, we picked a number so high that it would never be hit, the number we picked was $1 billion, and then it was hit again, and then the number picked was $65 billion."" – Former FTX Chief Technology Officer Gary Wang, explaining Alameda's line of credit. (10/06/23)  ""Microsoft's stock must be plunging."" – Judge Kaplan, after Assistant U.S. Attorney (AUSA) Danielle Sassoon said she was done presenting spreadsheets to former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison. (10/11/23)  ""One example is, when Alameda paid what I believe was a large bribe to Chinese government officials to get some of our exchange accounts unlocked."" ""Well. Let's break that down a bit."" – Ellison during her testimony, and a deadpan response from AUSA Sassoon. (10/11/23)  ""Why did you write a sad face?"" – AUSA Sassoon, reading Ellison's text messages. (10/11/23)  ""Objection your honor, this is confusing!"" – AUSA Sassoon, capping off Ellison's day after defense attorney Mark Cohen opened his cross-examination by needing several takes to correctly identify an email address. (10/11/23)  ""What he did with it afterward doesn't matter. This is like saying that if I break into the Federal Reserve Bank, make off with a million bucks, spend it all on Powerball tickets and happen to win, it was okay."" – Judge Kaplan, questioning the defense's push to mention Anthropic AI during testimony. (10/11/23)  ""I have enough binders here to go into business."" – Judge Kaplan, complaining about paperwork like so many of us would like to. (10/12/23)  ""The nicest room in the house."" – Nishad Singh, explaining which room he lived in with his girlfriend and several other FTX executives at a luxury apartment in the Bahamas. (10/17/23)  ""Hashtag Eric Adams."" – AUSA Danielle Kudla, reading a tweet that Bankman-Fried retweeted. (10/17/23)  ""If you can get that one fixed, maybe you can work on my PC."" – Judge Kaplan, after a court employee sorted a technical issue. (10/18/23)  ""Mr. Roos, can you repeat those backwards?"" ""Those are actually my lotto numbers also."" – Judge Kaplan and AUSA Nicholas Roos, after Roos introduced a copious number of exhibits into the record. (10/18/23)  ""Professor, you used the word ‘hashtag.’ Would you tell the jury what that is, please."" – Judge Kaplan, asking Professor Peter Easton after the witness described the mark preceding what looked like a crypto wallet address. (10/18/23)  ""Lest I forget it, when we're done, I would appreciate the government taking back all the used witness binders and so on which are beginning to threaten the stability of the bench here."" – Judge Kaplan, again being very relatable. (10/18/23)  — Nikhilesh De  But seriously…  Fun as it is to revisit these laugh lines during the break in trial proceedings, don’t forget that the collapse of FTX had grave human consequences. Our colleague Dilin Massand tells the tale of a heartbreaking and underreported aspect of the SBF tragedy: FTX ran a ""brand ambassador"" program in Africa that sounds like a multi-level marketing scheme; university students recruited friends and family members to put money on the exchange, money they could not longer access when FTX went kablooie. This quote hit us in the gut: ""He was crying because his referred users had invested 20 million naira because of him.""  What's more, at the end of this trial, 12 jurors are going to convene in a room and decide whether or not Bankman-Fried violated the law. If they find he did beyond a reasonable doubt, he faces decades in prison which – whatever one's personal feelings about the defendant – is a significant amount of time behind bars.  — Marc Hochstein  What we're expecting  The trial is out of session until Thursday, Oct. 26. The DOJ expects to present two, maybe three more witnesses before wrapping up late that morning. The potential witnesses are an FBI agent (who prosecutors hope they can avoid calling if they can reach an agreement with the defense), an FTX investor (who may spend 30 minutes on the stand) and a customer (who may spend 20 minutes on the stand).  The defense will begin presenting its case (should it choose to do so) after the lunch break.  — Nikhilesh De",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | RESEARCH,"Nikhilesh De, Marc Hochstein",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/10/20/the-sam-bankman-fried-trial-our-favorite-quotes-so-far,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/84d3ca7ee2a1134decf42c38bcf6e637ea645d1f-1920x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42419386,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEOCb,1697795945,SEC Likely to Approve Spot Bitcoin ETF in Next Few Months: JPMorgan,"Bitcoin (BTC) has gained this week due to increased optimism about the potential approval of multiple spot bitcoin exchange-traded-funds (ETFs), JPMorgan (JPM) said in a research report Wednesday.  The Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) decision not to appeal a recent ruling in the Grayscale case brings the approval of the applications closer, the report said. Grayscale is the manager of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), the largest cryptocurrency fund in the world.  Timing of an approval is unclear, but should happen within months, and probably before Jan. 10, the final deadline for the Ark 21Shares applications, analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote.  ETFs are traded on an exchange, like stocks, and track the performance of an underlying asset. They are popular because they allow investors to gain access to cryptocurrencies without having to purchase the underlying digital assets themselves. They are also cheaper to trade. The crypto market is hopeful that the approval of a spot bitcoin ETF will lead to a flood of mainstream money into the sector.  The bank reiterated its view that the regulator was likely to approve multiple applications at once rather than grant a “first mover advantage” to any single applicant.  JPMorgan said such a move could be beneficial for investors as it would encourage competition in regards to ETF fees.  “Grayscale will likely face greater pressure to lower fees if the trust gets approval to be converted into an ETF,” the report said.

Related Reading: xDay 2023 Day 1: How MultiversX Is Bridging The Metaverse, AI, And Blockchain Under Ecosystem On day two of the event, the MultiversX team, spearheaded by Beniamin Mincu, announced a partnership with big tech giant Google. The partners will work on driving adoption and “accelerating” the expansion of Web3 and the MultiversX ecosystem. Google Cloud Pledges Financial Support For MultiversX Ecosystem In conversation with Daniel Rood, Head of Web3 EMEA for Google Cloud, the partners spoke about the similarities in the obstacles faced by Google to reach billions of users. Mincu stated that this partnership with the big tech giant will help the network increase its adoption. The partnership will be supported by “4 pillars,” as stated by Rood. In that sense, the big tech giant announced that the data running on the MultiversX will be embedded directly into the Google Cloud infrastructure, adding an extra layer of security for the blockchain. In the past two years, MultiversX, formerly Elrond, implemented a sharding architecture capable of handling over 100,000 transactions per second. The project has focused heavily on providing its users and builders with a secure and scalable infrastructure; this partnership is another step in that direction. The MultiversX CEO stated the following about the partnership: We are excited to unveil this collaboration as part of a strategic plan meant to expand our ecosystem and bring significant opportunities for users and developers. MultiversX is in a unique position, with great potential for accelerated growth, and the additional products and services brought by Google Cloud are a key contribution to that. On the stage, Mincu expressed excitement about what the partnership represents for the MultiversX ecosystem and the nascent industry. The announcement was received with applause by the community. The MultiversX CEO emphasized their role as the “engine” driving the ecosystem. Thus, Google Cloud will also offer financial aid and pledge to create spaces like hackathons where builders can benefit from the partnership.

19101317,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=556202,1697792450,When Will The Bitcoin Bear Market End? US Mega Bank Has The Answer,"In a recent development, leading investment bank Morgan Stanley has weighed in on when the lingering Bitcoin bear market is likely to end. Interestingly, they share some similar views with analysts who have made predictions in the past. Bitcoin Halving A Major Factor In an article released by the investment bank, Morgan Stanley highlighted Bitcoin’s importance as the leading crypto and how the Bitcoin Halving, which is set to take place in April 2024, could affect its price and other crypto tokens by extension. Related Reading: XRP Price Prediction: Rare Bent Fork Pattern Predicts Explosive 3000% Surge To $15 Bitcoin halving is a deflationary measure that occurs every four years, during which the rewards of miners are ‘halved’, thereby creating scarcity. According to the bank, this event could potentially trigger a bull run as it has done in the past. The article further noted how there have been such bull runs in the past following the three halving events that have occurred and how the bull run lasted for 12 to 18 months after then. Morgan Stanley’s prediction echoes that of several crypto analysts who have predicted that the Bitcoin Halving could spark the next bull run. Specifically, the co-founder of Delphi Digital, Kevin Kell, while highlighting metrics that showed that the next bull run was close, noted that Bitcoin has broken to a new all-time high (ATH) seven months after the last two halvings occurred. Understanding The Four Phases Of Crypto While trying to avoid giving a definite time as to when to invest ahead of the next bull run, Morgan Stanley noted the importance of learning about the ‘four phases of cryptocurrency prices’ in order for one to make a conviction play as to the right time to invest. These four phases are said to correspond roughly to the four seasons of the year. The first phase is ‘Summer’ when Bitcoin experiences the most gains, which comes after the halving. The bull run is said to begin with the event and continue when Bitcoin’s price hits its prior peak. The next is the ‘Fall’ when the price “surpasses the old high.” This is the period when the bull market runs its full course after reaching a new high. Related Reading: Bitcoin Maximalist Calls Ethereum ‘Garbage’, Here’s Why After ‘Fall’ comes ‘Winter’, which is when the bear market surfaces as this is the period that investors are locking in their gains, resulting in a massive sell-off. This usually occurs between the “new peak and the next trough.” Historically, there have been three winters, with each of them lasting for about 13 months. ‘Spring’ is the last phase in the cycle and the one that potentially kickstarts the next bull run (another Summer). This is the period “preceding each halving,’ when Bitcoin’s price “generally recovers from the cycle’s low point, but investor interest tends to be weak.” By understanding these phases, crypto investors could be well-prepared to take advantage of the next bull run to make the most profits.

The worldwide Google search value for the phrase ""spot bitcoin ETF"" for a five-year window is on track to hit the peak value of 100 this week, indicating maximum interest among the general population. The value for ""bitcoin ETF"" has increased to 39, the highest since ProShares' futures-based ETF was launched two years ago. Back then, the search value for ""bitcoin ETF"" also touched 100.  In other words, more and more people on main street are scanning the web for information about bitcoin spot ETFs and how they might affect the market capitalization of what is already the world's largest the cryptocurrency. Market participants are convinced that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, having recently missed a deadline to challenge a critical legal loss, will approve a spot ETF early next year, opening the liquidity floodgates.  ""The approval of a spot BTC ETF has been an enduring theme in the crypto space and [is] often seen as a barometer of BTC's mainstreaming,"" Toronto-based crypto platform FRNT Financial, said in an email on Thursday, referring to the spike in Google search values for ETF.  Google Trends provides mostly unfiltered samples of search requests made to Google and scales their searches on a range of 0 to 100. The value represents the search interest relative to the highest point on the chart for the selected region and time. The peak value of 100 has historically marked bull market tops in BTC and solana (SOL).  A spot ETF will track the price of bitcoin rather than the prices of bitcoin futures and involves the purchase and ownership of the cryptocurrency by the provider. It's suited for anyone looking to take direct exposure to bitcoin without having to own the cryptocurrency themselves.  The spot ETF optimism gripped the market three months ago after heavyweights in traditional financial markets like BlackRock filed for one. It has insulated bitcoin from adverse macroeconomic developments, ensuring the cryptocurrency's outperformance against ether (ETH).  According to crypto services provider Matrixport, the bitcoin price could rise to between $42,000 and $56,000 if the BlackRock ETF is approved.

The judgement on Wednesday from a San Francisco district court and a subsequent SEC announcement on Thursday come nearly a year after the SEC brought charges against Thor Technologies on December 21, 2022.  Default judgments typically occur when the opposing party fails to take certain action, either failing to attend a trial or meet specific deadlines for filing documents.  The SEC had charged Thor and Chin for offering and selling ""Thor Tokens"" to fund a business of a software platform for gig economy workers and companies. The offers and sales of Thor Tokens were not registered with the SEC and were marketed as an investment opportunity, the SEC said. In April 2019, Thor announced it was shutting down its operations due to ""many regulatory challenges.""  The court has barred Thor and Chin from participating in any crypto asset securities offering and ordered a disgorgement of $744,555 with prejudgment interest of $158,638.06.

19098652,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=556192,1697787914,"Bitcoin Price Surges Past $30,000, Here’s Why","The Bitcoin price has surged to a 2-month high of $30,245 today, reflecting a 5.7% increase within the last 24 hours. While several factors could have contributed to this rally, four principal drivers appear to dominate discussions. #1 Expectations Of A Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval There’s palpable excitement within the community as rumors intensify about the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) potentially approving the first-ever spot Bitcoin ETFs. Currently, the SEC is actively engaging with prominent applicants including Grayscale, BlackRock, Fidelity, Invesco, and Ark Invest, among others. This has never happened before in the long history of Spot Bitcoin ETF rejections. It appears that the market may be starting to cautiously price in aka “front-run” the approval of a spot ETF. Just yesterday, BlackRock filed its updated ETF application, adding more fuel to the fire. As James Seyffart, a Bloomberg ETF expert, elucidated, “BlackRock filed an updated Bitcoin ETF prospectus early this morning which is likely their response to SEC comments like we’ve seen from Ark, Fidelity, and others. Just more confirmation that issuers are in talks with the SEC.” Related Reading: Bitcoin ETF Approval Anticipated To Trigger Fiat Influx Of $24-50 Billion Forecasts surrounding this potential approval are overwhelmingly bullish. Macro analyst Alex Kruger predicts a 20%+ price surge on the day of approval, while trader Christopher Inks sets his sights between $38,000 to $40,000. A recent CryptoQuant report posits that Bitcoin spot ETFs could swell the market cap by as much as $1 trillion, stating, “If $150 billion in fresh capital enters the Bitcoin market, it could increase BTC’s market cap by $450 billion to $900 billion.” Meanwhile, Matrixport’s research predicts a Bitcoin price range between $42,000 and $56,000 post-SEC’s approval of Blackrock’s ETF. #2 Jerome Powell’s Latest Speech In recent comments that have undoubtedly affected the crypto markets, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated the possibility of the central bank suspending its historic run of interest-rate hikes as long as there’s steady progress on inflation and rate hikes might be put on hold. Powell emphasized the importance of the 2% inflation target and addressed the balance between avoiding a potential recession and keeping inflation in check. While raising rates too high risks a major recession, not raising rates high enough risks another inflationary breakout. According to current market forecasts, the Fed will therefore not raise interest rates at the next FOMC meeting from October 31 to November 1 and will continue to monitor inflation data. This stance from the Fed likely provided a bullish nudge to Bitcoin and the larger crypto market. #3 Bitcoin’s Correlation to Gold Yesterday, the price of gold rose again by 1.3%, and since October 6, even by a whopping 10%. As NewsBTC reported yesterday, the gold price could be a leading indicator of the gold price. When gold rises, Bitcoin follows as a hedge against the chaos in the US government bond market and global crises and wars. Related Reading: Wait For Bitcoin At $20,000? This Analyst Says No Accordingly, Charles Edwards, founder of Capriole Investments, remarked via X (formerly Twitter) stating “The market is starting to price in the Fed’s overtightening and weakening economics. Combined with geopolitical tensions plus war, the need for QE in the future is increasing rapidly. This is causing insurance assets (Gold, Bitcoin) to absolutely rip in unison. When both of these assets move together like this, it’s often the start of something very big.” #4 Shorts Getting Liquidated According to data from Coinglass, roughly $88 million in Bitcoin shorts were liquidated in the recent move up. Thus, the futures market has played a role in this price move. Renowned crypto trader CrypNuevo stated via X, “All our liquidation levels to the upside from yesterday have been hit… Asia pumped and 12h liquidation chart is showing liquidations at the same level.” He also cautioned, “Current long-short open positions ratio is very high atm (+4 times more longs than shorts).” At press time, BTC saw a slight retracement and was trading at $30,097.

Tokens formed by the forking of Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Bitcoin SV (BSV) jumped as much as 26% to lead gains among alternative tokens in a sign of possible irrational exuberance.  Several ETF providers amended their filings over multiple days in the past week alongside pressure on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to soften its stance on a bitcoin ETF approval.  Earlier this week, four House Financial Services Committee members urged the SEC to listen to the courts and give up efforts to block bitcoin ETFs from regulatory approval in a letter to SEC Chair Gary Gensler.  Elsewhere, hopes of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) being converted into an ETF riled up some traders. GBTC is one of the largest institutional bitcoin holdings, and Grayscale is among several other asset managers who have applied for a bitcoin spot ETF. Other major firms in the race include BlackRock (BLK), Fidelity and WisdomTree (WT).  Meanwhile, traders said a ruling in Grayscale’s favor could tilt overall sentiment bullish and even set the bedrock for a broader market climb.  “Bitcoin has also been encouraged by possible ETF approval and an increasing number of ETF submissions by leading companies,” shared Lucy Hu, senior trader at Metalpha, in a message early Friday. “The SEC opted for a no-appeal on Grayscale’s ruling, and as the deadline for BTC spot ETF applications from institutions such as Blackrock looms closer, the market’s confidence in ETF approval has increased.”  “(With the) bitcoin ETF approval and halving event in April, the crypto market could kickstart a very robust bull market,” Hu added.

42419388,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEOGj,1697780412,XRP Registers Biggest Single-Day Gain in 3 Months After SEC Drops Charges Against Ripple's Leaders,"On Thursday, XRP logged its best daily percentage gain in three months as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) dropped securities-violations charges against fintech company Ripple’s top leaders.  XRP, the world’s fifth-largest digital asset, rose 6.5% to 52 cents jumping to a high of 53 cents before pulling back to 51 cents at press time, CoinDesk data shows.  In a court filing on Thursday, the SEC agreed to dismiss allegations against Ripple Chief Executive Brad Garlinghouse and co-founder Chris Larsen. The move comes months after the Southern District of New York said Ripple’s offer and sale of XRP on digital asset exchanges did not amount to offers and sales of investment contracts as alleged by the SEC.  Roughly three years ago, the SEC accused Ripple Labs, which has close ties with XRP, of violating securities laws by raising $1.3 billion through XRP sales to investors. The legal trouble kept XRP under pressure, even as the broader market surged.  Spot-led move  Buyers from the spot market likely powered Thursday’s rally in XRP. Spot-driven rallies are said to be more sustainable than those led by leverage traders.  Data from Coinalyze shows that cumulative volume delta (CVD) in spot exchanges rose along with XRP’s price, indicating net inflow into the market. Meanwhile, CVD in stablecoin and coin-margined futures markets remained flat.  A rising CVD means more buyers are in action, while a negative-sloping line implies there are more sellers.  Range breakout pending  Though impressive, Thursday’s gain fell short of ending a two-month price consolidation between 49 and 45 cents.  Range play, representing volatility meltdown, often paves the way for a big move in either direction.

Overall, Lido Finance is a liquidity staking protocol that supports the staking of multiple proof-of-stake (PoS) coins like Ethereum (ETH) without necessarily locking them up. Users can concurrently earn staking rewards while accessing their hard-earned ETH–or any other coin supported. The protocol issues another derivative, stETH, for every ETH staked to achieve this. This token can be freely traded on exchanges. It can even be used as collateral for users keen on taking trustless loans on supported platforms.

This transition was a boon for protocols that supported the first smart contract platform to confirm transactions and remain secure, especially after the activation of Shanghai in April 2023. The Shanghai upgrade allowed Ethereum validators to withdraw their staked ETH for the first time, permitting them to use alternatives, of which Lido Finance, looking at total value locked (TVL), was preferred. As of October 19, Lido Finance had a TVL of $13.913 billion, most of it being assets on Ethereum. Ethereum Centralization Concerns: How Will This Be Addressed? Lido Finance makes staking more accessible to everyone while concurrently enhancing liquidity. However, the revenue generated appears low versus the amount of staking rewards distributed to stakers, most of whom are from Ethereum. Part of the revenue the network generates is also distributed to LDO holders and node operators. Whether the liquidity staking protocol plans to increase the 10% fee charged to increase revenue earned remains to be seen.

Ethereum has been accused of being “centralized,” mainly in how it is built. Critics assert that the reliance on its co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, for endorsement and guidance could slow down development in the future.
