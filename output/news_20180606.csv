42380792,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8zSJl,1528327205,Coinbase 'On Track' to Become a Regulated Securities Firm,"Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase announced Wednesday that it was making strides toward its goal of operating a federally regulated broker-dealer.  Chief operating officer and president Asiff Hirji wrote in a company blog post that the firm is in the process of acquiring a broker-dealer license, an alternative trading system license and a registered investment advisor license. Once it has these licenses, the company intends to seek approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) to offer blockchain-based securities.  Part of this effort includes Coinbase's acquisitions of Keystone Capital Corp., Venovate Marketplace and Digital Wealth LLC, he wrote.  Hirji expanded on Coinbase's plans, writing:  ""We believe this is an important moment for the crypto ecosystem, and yet another indication of the maturation of the crypto economy. If approved, these licenses will set Coinbase on a path to offer future services that include crypto securities trading, margin and over-the-counter (OTC) trading, and new market data products.""  Beyond merely offering its own securitized tokens, Hirji said Coinbase could tokenize existing securities products, ""bringing to this space the benefits of cryptocurrency-based markets.""  These benefits would include real-time settlement, transparent chain-of-title and 24/7 trading, he said.  The move comes just weeks after Coinbase announced it had acquired decentralized crypto relay platform Paradex and that it was planning to rebrand its GDAX service as Coinbase Pro, as previously reported.  Coinbase also formally launched Coinbase Custody, its crypto storage service aimed primarily at large financial institutions, last month. As previously reported, Coinbase Custody includes a suite of products aimed at institutional investors.  Hirji highlighted what he saw as the potential for combining cryptocurrencies with securities firms in Wednesday's post, writing ""we believe this will democratize access to capital markets for companies and investors alike, lowering costs for all participants and bringing additional transparency and inclusion to the ecosystem.""

42380775,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8zS29,1528317034,Northern Trust Wins Patent for Storing Meeting Minutes on a Blockchain,"Financial services firm Northern Trust won a patent Wednesday for a method for backing up records of meetings using blockchain tech.  The method utilizes a series of smart contracts to capture data related to the meeting, including records of who is attending (sourced from devices they might carry), when the meeting took place and where. As previously reported, Northern Trust has been using a private blockchain it created with IBM to capture key data since 2017.  Northern Trust hones in on a very specific use case – event data, essentially – but it speaks to the firm's wider trend of gathering operational data through a distributed system.  As the filing explains:  ""During the meeting, a first smart contract may authenticate and record attendees in the digital meeting record based on biometric information received from the attendees' devices... a second smart contract may capture in the digital meeting record, meeting actions of each attendee, including date, time, and location associated with the meeting actions. After the meeting, a third smart contract may autopopulate post meeting documentation.""  Northern Trust won a second patent on digital identity management on Wednesday, public records further show. This second patent focuses on generating one-directional cryptographic hashes of reference documents and biometric information.  The two patents work hand-in-hand as the digital meeting records would be tied to a set of digital identity records. The meeting records would also use one or more encryption keys, generating an encrypted version of the records, that is then appended to a blockchain by the network node.  The function aims to ""integrate interactions between digital identities within the blockchain, authentication and recording processes using biometric information, document storage in a repository, and one or more smart contracts managing meeting activities in real-time.""  ""We have developed a number of blockchain innovations that may be applied to multiple business activities and product offerings, with private equity fund administration being only one example of many potential use cases,"" Justin Chapman, global head of market advocacy and innovation research at Northern Trust, said in a statement.

42380774,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8zS0t,1528311572,Secret ASICs for the People: Obelisk Reveals Plan to Fight Big Miners,"If you can't beat 'em, join 'em.  The age-old idiom may be particularly relevant for David Vorick, the co-founder of the Sia blockchain, whose new project aims to fight powerful crypto mining chip manufacturers by bringing competition to the sector. To do this, Vorick launched Obelisk, a new chip manufacturing business last year, an effort he later unveiled in a widely seen blog post in May.  As revealed exclusively to CoinDesk today, however, Vorick intends to begin developing proof-of-work algorithms for new cryptocurrencies. That project, called Launchpad, expects teams developing new cryptocurrencies to hire Obelisk to design a custom proof-of-work algorithm as well as the ASIC hardware that works on that algorithm – all in secret.  Shortly before the coin launches, Obelisk will turn the ASICs over to the team behind the cryptocurrency, who will distribute the hardware to the community so that no one party controls too much mining power, and so that most of the mining power is held by small players.  Launchpad comes at a time when many cryptocurrency communities are up in arms about the release of ASIC hardware – primarily manufactured by China-based Bitmain – to mine their blockchains. While a significant number of groups have gone to war with ASIC manufacturers, suggesting changes to their cryptocurrencies algorithms to render ASICs useless, others, like Vorick, believe all those attempts are doomed to fail.  ""You're going to end up with ASICs on your network,"" Vorick said in an interview.  Indeed, there's ample evidence for his position: in recent months, ASICs have been developed for ethereum's and zcash's mining algorithms, both of which were initially thought to be ASIC-resistant.  The contention is that ASICs (which are more expensive than the other hardware used in the operation of blockchain software) raise the barriers to entry to mining, and as such, can lead to a concentration of control in fewer hands. But these arguments also typically involve the vilification of Bitmain, a company that has become a boogeyman of sorts to the broader cryptocurrency community.  Speaking to that, Taariq Lewis, a tenured crypto developer and entrepreneur, and the leader of a project codenamed Lyra Protocols, which plans on using Obelisk's Launchpad effort, told CoinDesk:  ""We've been losing the thread of focus on decentralization. When Obelisk is first to market, our community is first to market, and that's what's important to us.""  Trust in Obelisk  According to Lewis, Launchpad will have a ""positive influence"" on many cryptocurrency communities.  That's because, by the time a cryptocurrency goes live, more than 50 percent of the network's mining power will be controlled by small mining operations with perhaps 100 machines, rather than operations that control warehouses full of mining hardware, accounting for a significant amount of hash power.  No entity – not even Obelisk – will control more than 20 percent of the mining power on these new networks, although ASIC distribution choices are ultimately up to the team.  That said, there is a kind of trade-off in that cryptocurrency teams will have to put a considerable amount of trust in Obelisk, or rather two people that work at Obelisk – Vorick himself and the company's lead chip developer.  Aside from them, no one will know the full proof-of-work algorithm to be deployed or the ASIC's design – even to the team behind the cryptocurrency itself.  While this may seem counter to the cryptocurrency community's aversion to trust, Lewis said his project is so excited about Obelisk's service, he expects users will be willing to pay a premium on typical mining equipment prices.  ""People are signaling to us that they're willing to put a premium on one, getting the chance to be first, and two, transparency and trust,"" he said.  And according to Vorick, the trust only goes as far as the coin and accompanying algorithm's launch. After that, Obelisk will be ""stubborn about being completely transparent,"" he said.  For one, Obelisk will open source the algorithm and ASIC hardware design once the network goes live. That way, community members can be first to market, beating Bitmain and other big manufacturers.  It remains to be seen whether Obelisk's cloak-and-dagger approach to taking on the big chip makers (economics of scale are tough to beat).  But for now, Lewis remains optimistic, quipping:  ""It's gonna make bitcoin great again.""

In the interview, Clayton sought to clarify the kinds of characteristics that the agency would look for when determining whether a blockchain-based token constitutes a security.  ""A token, a digital asset, where I give you my money and you go off and make a venture, and in return for giving you my money I say 'you can get a return' that is a security and we regulate that,"" he told CNBC's Bob Pisani. ""We regulate the offering of that security and regulate the trading of that security.""  And when asked if the agency would come out with a clearer statement on the matter, Clayton responded: ""Bob, I hope I just did.""  According to a transcript published by CNBC, Clayton declined to say whether tokens like ether or XRP constitute securities, as some have argued.  SEC said last summer that ""U.S. federal securities law may apply"" to ICOs that it would regulate ""various activities, including distributed ledger technology, depending on the particular facts and circumstances, without regard to the form of the organization or technology used to effectuate a particular offer or sale.""  Clayton's comments follow the appointment of Valerie Szczepanik as the agency's point person on token sale and cryptocurrency matters. Szczepanik previously led the SEC's distributed ledger working group.

Rostin Benham, a commissioner at the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), spoke during the Blockchain for Impact Global Summit, held at the United Nations Plaza on Monday. During his speech, he emphasized the major potential for blockchain to address issues in healthcare, employment and crime, among other sectors.  Calling cryptocurrencies a ""technological revolution,"" Behnam said:  ""But virtual currencies may – will – become part of the economic practices of any country, anywhere. Let me repeat that: these currencies are not going away and they will proliferate to every economy and every part of the planet ... Virtual currencies could transform the economic and social landscape.""  Benham also warned against the flip-side of cryptocurrencies if they are not properly overseen, saying, ""if we are not thoughtful, if we do not remain ever diligent to the movements within the transformation, we may unleash corruption, criminality and division on a greater scale.""  ""Blockchain could become a source for repression and totalitarianism,"" he warned.  This is not the first time Benham has expressed caution about the potential use cases for blockchain. In an earlier address last month at the FIA Law and Compliance conference, he shared concerns over the possibility of cryptocurrencies threatening the stability of the financial industry.  Still, his sentiments over blockchain remain ever cognizant of the new technology's ability to remake ""our economic, social, and political relations.""  The BFI summit was aimed at uncovering the applications of blockchain technology to sustainable development and humanitarian challenges by engaging the United Nations (UN) departments, funds, programs and specialized agencies.

Under the arrangement, VanEck will market the ETF, while SolidX will act as sponsor, according to a press release. The companies noted that both have previously filed individually to list bitcoin ETFs on various stock exchanges.  VanEck chief executive Jan van Eck said bitcoin is ""a legitimate investment option, as a type of 'digital gold' that may make sense for investors' portfolios.""

When asked by CoinDesk, he declined to provide details on what assets would be used to back the fund.  Neither SolidX nor VanEck has succeeded in launching a bitcoin ETF to date. As previously reported by CoinDesk, both companies withdrew previous attempts at launching the products at the request of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  Van Eck expressed optimism about the fund's potential, despite the regulatory obstacles they have faced, saying:  ""We believe that collectively we will build something that may be better than other constructs currently making their way through the regulatory process. A properly constructed physically-backed bitcoin ETF will be designed to provide exposure to the price of bitcoin, and an insurance component will help protect shareholders against the operational risks of sourcing and holding bitcoin.""

BNB achieved the new milestone of 0.002287 BTC at 10:45 UTC Wednesday, and was last seen changing hands at 0.0022 BTC on Binance, up 8 percent since yesterday.  The sharp rally pushed BNB's market capitalization to a five-month high above $1.9 billion, making it the 17th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.  Further, the rally is backed by a 155 percent rise in trading volume over the last 48 hours, so the stellar gains look sustainable.  Meanwhile, the binance coin-U.S. dollar (BNB/USD) exchange rate hit a 5.5-month high of $17.60 on Binance and was trading at $16.74 at press time – up 15 percent in the last 24 hours.

42380796,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8zSL1,1528293825,Ethereum Software Parity to Update After Critical Bug Detected,"A critical consensus bug has been uncovered in a testing environment used by one of the two principal softwares crucial to the operation of the world's second-largest blockchain.  Revealed last night by UK-based Parity Technologies in a blog post, the issue was found to cause those running the software to fall out of sync, meaning others using different software would not recognize their transactions. While the vulnerability was found on a testnet, the worry is that it could be exploited on the mainnet as well.  As such, Parity is now urging all users to update their software to a newly patched version.  Publicly available data  suggests the bug could have impacted roughly 30 percent of the ethereum network – those that use software issued by Parity to stay in sync with the wider network. But according to representatives of Parity, the issue was patched before it reached nodes operating the live ethereum blockchain.  Still, companies must update to the new software to remain safe from the vulnerability on the mainnet.  Speaking on Twitter, several companies, including mining pool Bitfly, have come forward to state they've updated their software to the newly secured iteration (1.10.6-stable or 1.11.3-beta).  As companies that operate on ethereum begin updating their software to avoid the issue, it has been theorized that it could still impact any blockchains that run Parity software, including users of ethereum classic (ETC).  The news of the vulnerability comes at a time when Parity has been under increased scrutiny for several similar security issues. Most notably, last November, a bug in one of the company's wallet offerings led 513,774.16 ETH, or $311 million according to current metrics, being frozen and in turn, inaccessible to its owners.  Discussion as to whether the frozen funds should be returned is ongoing, but in the interim, Parity has stated its commitment to a refined security process, writing:  ""We would like for our bugs to be a catalyst for more secure ethereum development.""  Three lines of code  Speaking to CoinDesk, Wei Tang, a Parity developer who assisted with yesterday's code patch, said that the bug is linked to a piece of code from ethereum improvement proposal (EIP) 86.  Formerly planned for ethereum's upgrade last year, EIP 86 aimed to introduce what is called ""account abstraction,"" allowing for transactions to be sent without a signature from the sender. The full ethereum upgrade to EIP 86 was postponed due to its complexity, however, Wei explained that Parity nevertheless implemented the code, possibly due to its role in ethereum's upcoming consensus switch.  According to Wei, the team in charge of implementing it within Parity's software had overlooked three lines of code that led to yesterday's consensus issue.  ""We missed a conditional check in our code that caused full node Parity to accept a block containing invalid transactions,"" Wei told CoinDesk.  Several such transactions were discovered on the Ropsten test network yesterday, and due to the transactions incompatibility with the wider ethereum blockchain, the transactions led a fork to occur between Parity and Geth (the largest provider of ethereum software accounting for 60 percent of users) clients.  Speaking in a press release, Kirill Pimenov, head of security at Parity, said that in the ""worst case"" such transactions would have resulted in corrupted blocks on the ethereum mainnet that ""would still be treated as valid by other affected Parity ethereum nodes.""  Given sufficient hashpower, such an exploit would result in a blockchain split, Pimenov continued.  ""The response to this situation was proactive, meaning we were able to prepare a fix before anyone was actually able to exploit the bug. As a result, we have managed to avert a mainnet split,"" Pimenov stated in the press release.  Wei echoed this, saying the fix, which was released mere hours ago, was simple.  ""We add those three lines of the missing conditional check in our code,"" Wei told CoinDesk, adding:  ""But yeah this three lines have severe effect. We've also got many eyes to review the code during the process.""

In a report published Wednesday, Bloomberg said that alongside the banking license, Circle – which offers a cryptocurrency wallet and investment platform, as well as an OTC crypto trading service – would also seek to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as a brokerage and trading platform.  The move from the Goldman Sachs-backed firm, if successful, would allow it to trade crypto tokens that are considered as securities in the U.S. and would also help it circumvent the complexities of registering as a cryptocurrency firm with regulators in all 50 states.  ""You're able to have a single conversation,"" Circle's chief compliance officer, Robert Bench, told Bloomberg. ""It's hard to have 50 conversations.""  Following early talks with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency over the banking registration, as well as with the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Circles said it would likely seek SEC regulation before moving to apply for the banking license, according to the report.  Jeremy Allaire, Circle's CEO, was quoted as saying in an interview:  ""To hold reserves with the Federal Reserve, ... to directly settle with other banks in other markets around the world through those networks – that can improve the efficiency of what we deliver, it can reduce the costs.""  He added that the firm would also provide regulators with a ""great guinea pig"" in explorations of regulatory frameworks as Wall Street giants move closer to adopting cryptocurrency.  The ambitious move would seem to align well with Circle's notable aim, as reported by CoinDesk in October 2017, to eventually offer a wide range of digital assets.  ""I think what we would be comfortable saying is that digital assets – which are not just digital currencies, but a broader range of assets – it's an area that has grown a lot, but that's not easily accessible to mainstream investors,"" Allaire told CoinDesk at the time.      Further supporting that aim, Circle acquired the Poloniex exchange in February to build an exchange service that will ultimately offer a host of cryptocurrencies. Sources suggested at the time that the firm put down roughly $400 million for the deal.  Investors are also seeing potential in the firm's widening scope, with Circle closing a $110 million Series E fundraising round in May. Led by China-based mining firm Bitmain, the round saw participation from Accel, Blockchain Capital, Breyer, Digital Currency Group, General Catalyst, IDG, Pantera and Tusk Ventures.

42380793,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8zSFz,1528290026,Ripple Smart Contracts Creator Targets Ethereum with New Tech Launch,"Ripple's former CTO Stefan Thomas is going up against Ethereum with the launch of a new smart contracts platform.  Well, ""new"" isn't quite right – the platform Thomas released implementations for today is Codius, an open-source project that Ripple released in beta in 2014 but shelved the following year. Now, though, having announced his departure from Ripple in May, Thomas is re-launching Codius as the technical backbone for his new company, Coil.  Using Codius, Coil aims to change the way websites monetize their content.  According to Thomas, monetizing web content has so far relied on clunky ""workarounds"" like ads, paywalls and user data harvesting (think Facebook's recent debacle). But his new project, by using Interledger, an open-source protocol that was developed inside Ripple for sending payments across different ledgers, plans to allow users' browsers to make micropayments to websites they visit.  Codius could enable use cases such as a ""revenue disbursement contract,"" which could take in revenue as people watch a movie and pay that money out to all the parties that made the movie – and not in batch payments, but little by little. Or a Codius smart contract could help news outlets and their readers interact in that it could manage readers' authorizations and subscriptions ""and act as a sort of switching board for your money,"" Thomas said.  The implementation released today comes with tutorials for uploading and hosting Codius smart contracts (uploaders pay hosts to run smart contracts on their computers), to try and push developers to start using the platform right away.  And already several developers have disclosed they'll be building on the platform, as revealed exclusively to CoinDesk.  Telindus, an Luxembourg-based IT solutions subsidiary of the state-owned Belgian telecom Proximus Group, will use Codius to ""push forward novel direct e-commerce models,"" Telindus chief architect Thomas Scherer told CoinDesk.  Josh Williams – who has previously invested in well-known game platforms Unity, Zynga and Kabam – said he'd be using Codius in new ventures, including a gaming company that is currently in stealth.  Williams told CoinDesk:  ""Teams in games and elsewhere are building on Ethereum and running into the cost and scalability issues we're all familiar with. Codius has great potential in addressing these concerns, and we are eager to work with it.""  Thomas echoed that sentiment, saying that as Ethereum has demonstrated the viability of smart contract use cases, it has simultaneously shown the world its own vulnerabilities, as Ethereum-based applications continue to run into scaling difficulties.  In contrast to Ethereum, Codius was designed to allow developers to write smart contract code in any programming language and have the smart contracts work as ""smart oracles,"" communicating with outside data sources.  As such, Thomas said, Codius has an opening.  ""The people that are reaching out to us are saying, 'Hey, we're experimenting on Ethereum. We're running into scalability issues. It's too expensive, too slow. It's not flexible enough. We don't like writing in this awkward language,'"" he said.  What's changed?  So why did Ripple set Codius aside?  While Codius generated its share of buzz in early 2015, before Ethereum's mainnet was live, according to Thomas, the idea seemed premature. Ripple engineers touted the platform as a model for interoperability at the time, saying it was able to handle not just XRP – the cryptocurrency most closely associated with Ripple – but bitcoin, ether and fiat currencies.  But the project hit snags, however.  Adding smart contracts opened up new ways to attack the ledger, and the technical architecture was cumbersome. Speaking in 2015, Thomas said that building smart contracts into a blockchain was like writing software directly into a database – difficult.  The team realized, Thomas told CoinDesk in a recent interview, that computer science had solved that problem in the 1970s by developing a three-tier architecture, in which a ""logic layer"" sits between the database and user interface layers.  Codius would serve as that middle layer, Thomas said, adding, ""You would have a bit of code that's accessing some assets on XRP ledger, that's accessing some data that's in Ethereum, and maybe it's making an HTTP call and so you have a much more flexible architecture. And most importantly you can have those kinds of contracts call other contracts as well.""  But building that kind of platform required efficient communication between ledgers, something that wasn't available at the time, and so Ripple began developing the open-source Interledger Protocol to allow for this communication.  Plus, Thomas said:  ""We just didn't feel like smart contracts was a very mature industry at that point…. Frankly, the use cases seemed somewhat dubious in value.""  As such, Codius was shelved. But now, three years later, Thomas' doubts about the value of such a smart contract platform have disappeared.  Rather, he sees Ethereum's scaling issues – expensive transactions and slow confirmation times – as signs that smart contracts are ready ""to move away from the mainframes, move away from Ethereum and go over to a more flexible architecture that involves multiple different ledgers.""  Ethereum killer?  Codius, though, is hardly the only would-be Ethereum-killer to emerge over the past couple years.  All of these projects, like Codius, tout the ability to process faster and cheaper transactions, but there's typically a trade-off involved – either in terms of security or blockchain's defining benefit, decentralization.  EOS, for instance, a delegated proof-of-stake cryptocurrency project which is currently in the midst of launching on mainnet, promises faster, cheaper transactions, because the blockchain only needs to be verified by 21 validator nodes, not by the whole distributed community of miners as in Ethereum and bitcoin.  Thomas, though, argues that Codius' design enables developers to balance their own priorities, rather than having to accept the network's compromises as a given.  ""You can choose the level of decentralization,"" Thomas told CoinDesk. ""If you upload it to four or five hosts, you'll have a decentralization level that's similar to Ethereum [and] you'll have a cost that's still orders of magnitude lower. Or you can upload it to 100 hosts, and you'll have a much greater level of decentralization than you can get with Ethereum.""  As it relates to security, Thomas argues, Codius has several advantages over Ethereum and other smart contract blockchains.  For one, the network is built on HyperContainer, an open-source project that uses Docker containers to isolate a given contract's code and minimize its vulnerabilities to attack. And secondly, Codius developers aren't locked into a nascent programming language like Solidity, which they're unlikely to know as well as JavaScript, for example.  ""I think that a lot of the issues and compromises, big hacks and so on have been directly related to the fact that these are all new languages whose security's not very well understood,"" said Thomas.  As for price, Thomas contrasts Ethereum's transaction costs – which can exceed 60 cents and even a dollar – with those of Amazon Web Services' Lambda platform, which costs 20 cents per million requests. AWS is centralized, but Thomas still expects Codius' costs to fall ""between those two extremes.""  For Thomas, rolling out Codius is the first step towards building a standard protocol for monetizing web content, as well as the ecosystem around it. Eventually, Thomas believes firms might decide to host websites on Codius rather than AWS, with Coil serving as a kind of ""Spotify, but in an open way"" – a protocol connecting consumers, internet service providers, websites and content creators.  And while the code is still ""rough,"" Thomas remains optimistic that Codius will prove a step forward for developers writing smart contracts that solve problems for today's businesses.  He concluded:  ""From a cost, scalability and security standpoint, as well as the flexibility … it's orders of magnitude more viable for mainstream use cases.""

42380759,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8zPu3,1528285237,Japan to Deny Crypto Exchange Application in Regulatory First,"Japan's financial market regulator is reportedly planning to issue its first ever refusal order to a business registration application filed by a domestic cryptocurrency exchange.  According to a Nikkei report on Tuesday, a trading platform called FSHO will likely see its registration application denied by the Financial Service Agency (FSA) due to its previous failures to comply with existing Japanese financial rules.  As reported by CoinDesk previously, although the FSA has allowed several crypto exchanges including FSHO to operate within the country in the absence of full regulatory approval, the watchdog issued two suspension orders to the firm in March and April.  The reason for the actions, as explained by the FSA at the time, was that the platform had not implemented strict know-your-customer (KYC) procedures and subsequently failed to report suspicious transactions that might indicate money laundering.  Although the Nikkei report did not indicate when the denial order might be issued, the previous FSA notice indicates that the current suspension order extends until June 7.  ""The Financial Services Agency will clarify its attitude towards rebuilding a healthy trading environment by denying a sloppy dealer,"" Nikkei said.  The reported FSA action, if true, would seemingly mark a toughening stance by the financial watchdog as it beefs up scrutiny of domestic crypto exchanges following the $530 million Coincheck hack that shocked the industry in January.

42380768,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8zQ6d,1528283441,"Treading Water: Bitcoin Bulls Await Break Above $7,780","Bitcoin (BTC) continues to operate in bearish territory and only a move above $7,780 would put the bulls back into the driver's seat, the technical charts indicate.  As of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading at $7,591 on Bitfinex. The cryptocurrency was on the defensive yesterday, courtesy of a failed breakout and a rising-wedge breakdown and looked set to re-test the recent low of $7,040.  However, sellers ran out of steam at $7,372, as indicated by a doji candle and prices moved back above $7,600 in the Asian session today.  While the exact reason behind the bear exhaustion is unclear, it fits with a recently observed pattern that bitcoin changes direction in favor of the weaker side on, or close to, the sixth day of every month.  The cryptocurrency is down more than 30 percent from the recent high of $9,990, meaning the bulls are on the back foot. So bitcoin could turn higher today, as indicated by the historical pattern.  Furthermore, the fear of getting trapped on the wrong side of the market may have forced the bears to stay on the sidelines, despite the false breakout and rising-wedge breakdown.  That said, the cryptocurrency is still treading waters in the bearish territory, as seen in the chart below.  4-hour chart  The bearish rising-wedge breakdown remains valid as long as bitcoin keeps trading below $7,780 (June 3 high). So, the downside is still in play and the sell-off could accelerate if the support at $7,372 is breached.  However, the 50-candle moving average (MA) has started rising in favor of the bulls and the 100-candle MA has flatlined (shed bearish bias), so the odds of a break below $7,372 are low.  View  A high volume break above $7,780 would add credence to the quirky ""6th of the month"" pattern and signal a bullish trend reversal. In this case, prices will likely rise to the 10-week MA, currently located at $8,310.  A break below $7,372 would put the focus back on the rising-wedge breakdown and allow a drop to $7,040.

The fund, currently worth around $166 million based on CoinMarketCap data, will be used to launch the Huobi Chain Project, which is also aimed to establish a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) on top of the proprietary blockchain, the company said at a press conference in Singapore.  The blockchain would serve as a platform for users to participate in token fundraising events (ICOs), as well as to vote for which tokens should be listed on Huobi, said Chen Guang, a director at the company's ecosystem development arm.  While the firm also envisions ultimately migrating its exchange to the blockchain system to evolve it into a decentralized exchange, such a move is still uncertain as the move would require higher levels of efficiency and security.  Even so, Chen believes the future of the blockchain ecosystem should be a combination of centralization and decentralization.  He told CoinDesk:  ""We want this to be a social experiment. The future is not likely to be entirely decentralized. As such it's important to find the equilibrium that balances the two polars, which is the ultimate goal of this exploration.""  As such, Houbi is seeking external assistance in developing the new system by providing the 30 million tokens as incentives over a number of stages. Further, Chen said, the exchange will allocate a fraction of its yearly revenue to the pool, though it is yet to disclose the exact percentage.  The development process is anticipated to be completed in the next 18 months, and will be divided into eight phases – with each being, in effect, a contest for developers to participate in and to compete for the tokens.  To guide the process, the company will first establish a committee in the next two to three weeks that will craft a policy and self-regulatory framework for the competition.  Chen indicated that the company is currently talking to up to 10 well-known leaders from open-source blockchain projects who might help form the committee, but declined to reveal the names on the list.  The committee will further nominate a list of candidates for Huobi Chain Project's potential global lead. After nomination, users will jointly vote for the preferred candidate using their Huobi Tokens. The winner will lead the project's development and fund allocation at each phase.  While the exact amount of funding to be provided for each stage remains unknown, Chen said it is expected to increase as the project progresses.  Also in today's press conference, Cai Kailong, chief strategy officer of Huobi Group, announced that the company is launching a new exchange in Australia with expectations of a launch by the end of June.

42380758,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8zPvJ,1528272020,Fujitsu Rolls Out System That Turns Reward Points into Blockchain Tokens,"Japanese IT giant Fujitsu says it has launched a blockchain-based data storage system that can be used by retail merchants to tokenize traditional promotional tools such as coupons and reward points.  According to a press release published Wednesday, the system – currently being rolled out in Japan – can be integrated with the promotional activities of merchants in shopping centers or tourism zones that traditionally allow consumers to spend coupons or digital points received from one shop at different outlets within the area.  By tokenizing such digital points and coupons, the blockchain system can process and store consumers' usage transactions in a decentralized manner, reducing the workload of a traditional data center and allowing for better data analysis, the firm says.  The ultimate goal, according to Fujitsu, is to revitalize regional economies – that's if the application can be expanded across communities where tokenized points can circulate among shops, restaurants, schools, transportations and tourism sites.  To arrive at its final product, Fujitsu conducted various field trials using blockchain technology through partnerships with different organizations, including railway, telecoms companies and convenient stores. In March of this year, the company tested the point-tokenization technology at one branch of Taiwan's FamilyMart convenient stores, where a distributed ledger platform was used to transact and store users' digital stamps in the shop.  Fujistu is no stranger to blockchain, having taken part in pilots testing the technology in money transfers and having already released a similar system for secure data sharing. More recently, the firm launched a blockchain innovation center in Belgium to facilitate research and projects around the tech.  Perhaps most notably, in March the firm revealed a new technology that it said could help to mitigate problems with Ethereum smart contracts.

42380765,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8zPz5,1528268437,The Real Reason Token Issuers Are Fleeing the US,"Scott Nelson is the chairman and CEO of Sweetbridge Inc., a blockchain tech startup.        Race to the bottom or race to reality?  The rise of initial coin offering (ICOs) – as controversial as they may be – is a signpost that the age of Industrial Era capital formation is giving way to a new paradigm of decentralized and democratized investment and customer-driven business models that expand far beyond the borders of any one country.  In this arena, entrepreneurs and companies will naturally gravitate toward the jurisdictions that allow them to raise funds from investors and serve customers around the world in a fast, safe and effective manner and with minimal friction.  Recognizing that this shift to a new Decentralized Era is underway, numerous countries are positioning themselves at the forefront of this transition so as to reap the economic, financial and geopolitical benefits that come with being the go-to jurisdiction for global capital formation.  Unfortunately, the United States is not yet among these countries, as it has instead taken a short-sighted and enforcement-heavy approach that fails to expand beyond Industrial Era thinking.  While U.S. regulators have publicly offered platitudes about being friendly to innovation and facilitating domestic entrepreneurship in the crypto space, the proof is always in the pudding.  In this case, the ""pudding"" is that serious cryptocurrency projects are faced with two unappealing choices: either issue tokens through outmoded and ill-fitting means that restrict a token's customer base and resale ability – like registering as a security or claiming a Regulation D exemption – or leave the U.S. altogether.  Race to value  As highlighted by CoinDesk, the natural and predictable consequence is that innovators are leaving the U.S. in search of friendlier jurisdictions.  To meet this demand, places like Gibraltar, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Malta and, most recently, Bermuda have been rolling out the welcome mat for token sales and structuring local regulations to balance the goals of industry development and consumer protection.  Some might eye the questionable reputations of some crypto-friendly countries and immediately conclude that there is a ""race to the bottom"" occurring whereby regulators, in search of revenue and headlines, green-light even the most fantastical token ideas without asking any questions.  In our observation, this is not happening.  In seeking to responsibly sell tokens to customers, my company, Sweetbridge, has spent a substantial amount of time in discussions with regulators from around the world -- including representatives of many G20 countries. And we've been encouraged by the thoughtful approaches and due diligence that has been demonstrated.  While there will surely be instances of this type of jurisdictional arbitrage employed by fringe actors, no serious crypto project wants to domicile in a country where anything goes.  Instead of a race to the bottom, we see a race to quality where serious projects flock to the places that offer the best overall value proposition: the best legal expertise, the best balance of regulatory controls with innovatory freedom, the best technologists and the best branding – even if cheaper (and possibly seedier) services can be acquired elsewhere.  For example, Switzerland's appeal is not just the regulatory aspect but also the talent and support ecosystems that it has developed concomitantly. Other jurisdictions like Gibraltar are going one step further by establishing not only guidelines and requirements for companies launching ICOs, but launching a fully-regulated exchange providing listing and liquidity for projects launching there.  Follow the leader  Countries large and small are beginning to heed this message.  While still grappling with the best way to tackle this new business model, many are rethinking outmoded approaches to capital formation – particularly the idea that token issuances are necessarily investment contracts.  They see an opportunity to inject fresh life into their local economies and potentially shake up the global balance of financial power.  To put it simply: they aren't stupid.  Should they wake up to see billions of dollars of real economic value being created in places Liechtenstein and Gibraltar while the U.S. chases its own tail deciding whether or not ether is a security, they're going to find a way to get in on the act – and with haste.  Royal opportunity  In Sweetbridge's view, the sleeping giant in this conversation is the United Kingdom.  The Brits have long been eager to wrestle the title of world's premier financial center away from the U.S. and recrown the City of London, and there is a growing sense within governmental ranks that blockchain and financial technology may be the ticket to doing just that.  While the U.S. lacks impetus for change, Britain is looking for relevance in a post-Brexit world. Thus, its traditionally conservative financial culture has expressed an introspective openness to new ideas.  For instance, the Fintech Regulatory Sandbox recently launched by the Financial Conduct Authority, Britain's top financial regulator, gives challengers and innovators a way to launch without prohibitive compliance costs.  The Brits also understand the consequences of failing to capitalize on paradigm-shifting economic transitions.  Despite birthing the Industrial Revolution, they grew too comfortable in their colonial Agrarian Era societal structure and ultimately forfeited dominance of the Industrial Era to the U.S. because they were unable to adapt quickly enough.  Additionally, the legal structure of the British Commonwealth is relatively amenable to new means of capital formation. It is predisposed to a ""buyer beware"" approach toward these types of products, as opposed to the paternalistic mentality of the U.S. that ensures only rich people get access to the good investment deals (unless that ""deal"" happens to be offered by a state-sponsored lottery).  Certainly, not all innovative crypto projects will abandon the U.S., but it has become disappointingly clear in recent months that there is too much inertia built up around its regulatory infrastructure for it to play top dog in the coming era of decentralized business models and global capital formation.

42380769,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8zQ5N,1528257646,Testing for Ethereum's Coming Consensus Change Is Moving Ahead,"A hotly anticipated change aimed at ridding ethereum of its bitcoin-inspired mining process is moving forward in testing, with the platform's popular software clients now participating in review.  Following on an April software release that saw the idea formalized in code, the upgrade looks to transition the world's second largest blockchain into a new way to keep those running its software in sync. However, the current iteration of the idea (called Casper FFG) finds ethereum's developers proceeding with a plan that would enable both its new and old consensus algorithms to work together to protect the network from unexpected attack vectors that may arise during the transition.  Under the proposal, smart contracts will link miners that secure the network with a new set of participants called ""validators.""  The code provides a way for mining to continue undisturbed by layering a smart contract on top of ethereum that allows users to bet on transaction histories in exchange for rewards. However, the smart contract also contains a limited amount of ether, that has been programmed to deplete- or what the devs call a ""funding crunch.""  According to the current block times, the contract is set to run dry in about two years, at which time the new consensus method, proof-of-stake, is expected to launch – and ethereum will relinquish its mining layer entirely.  But while much of that has been in the project's official roadmap, what's new is that the smart contract in question is getting tested by Parity, the second largest ethereum software client. Plus, Geth, the largest ethereum software client by users, is getting closer to launching its implementation of the code on testnet.  ""All of the major clients are working on implementation,"" author of the Casper specification, Danny Ryan, said.  The forward momentum will come as a relief to many in the ethereum community who are upset by the recent release of specialized crypto mining hardware that some believe will disturb the platform's distributed network of users.  And with the work going toward testing the smart contract – less than a year from when the Casper white paper was released – it seems clients are equally as interested in pushing proof-of-stake from concept to code.  Ryan told CoinDesk:  ""Proof of stake has been on the roadmap since day zero. Our community is very excited to take the first step with this hybrid model and to follow it up with a full [proof-of-stake] implementation soon after.""  Critiquing the contract  And there's reason for those backing the software to feel confident in their current approach.  For one, proponents argue releasing the code as a smart contract first reduces the complexity of the full proof-of-stake transition and creates a software-agnostic template for ethereum's various software iterations, or clients, to build upon.  ""The contract acts as a black box for much of the functionality and thus greatly reduces the complexity of the code that has to be replicated across clients,"" Ryan said.  As client developers implement the spec, Ryan said, they're likely to identify issues that can feed back into the initial code as well. Already an issue has been identified – a piece of code that could enable spam transactions.  Wei Tang, the developer leading Parity's integration, told CoinDesk:  ""The Casper research team is really open to those critiques.""  Tang added that his team has been proactively addressing problems as they come up, and said, ""I think Casper research team, Geth, Parity and other implementations still need to work together to agree on and improve the specifications.""  As such, it's a collaborative moment between Casper researchers and client developers, each working together to finalize the code.  Ryan echoed this, telling CoinDesk, ""Formalizing the spec in EIP 1011 really opened contributions and development up to the entire community.""  More testnets  According to Wei, Parity is using the testnet specification to test out network functionality, such as how voting happens and blocks are formed, in an effort to make sure the smart contract code behaves in conditions that mirror those of ethereum itself. Not only that, but Wei said, the testing is also about making sure the smart contract doesn't conflict with the way ethereum clients are written.  And in these tests, Wei said, both the Parity and Geth teams have made good progress.  ""I'm excited about Parity's testnet,"" Ryan told CoinDesk, ""I believe they are the first client to get EIP 1011 implemented. As more clients implement, we will either have them join Parity's net or we will coordinate a new testnet.""  Parity's current testnet won't be the only one, though.  ""The current Parity Casper testnet is certainly not the last one,"" Wei said, noting that the specification will have to be tested many times before it's finally released to all users.  He continued:  ""Casper is a relatively big change to the consensus protocol, so we need to be careful, and there are also many parameters in specifications that need to be finalized.""  Ryan said similar things about not rushing the implementation, during an ethereum core developer call on June 1.  According to Ryan, the smart contract is unlikely to be launched alongside ethereum's upcoming hard fork, Constantinople. Rather, Ryan continued, it's important to have all ethereum clients testing the code in a shared testing environment before such decisions can be made.  ""Parity's done some great work and there's some ongoing work with the side team with Geth, kind of putting all the pieces together and hopefully getting a testnet with more than just Parity up in the next few weeks,"" he concluded.  EDIT (07:30 UTC June 8, 2018): An earlier version of this article incorrectly conflated the ""funding crunch"" with the ""difficulty bomb."" This has now been corrected.
