42434663,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPsd3h,1625005815,Spain Considers Implementing a Digital Euro,"CORRECTION (June 30, 2021, 19:10 UTC): Spain's governing party has proposed examining how a digital euro would work, not a native central bank digital currency.      The Spanish Socialist Party (PSOE), the governing political body in Spain, has proposed the creation of a study group to implement the digital euro as a public digital currency.      PSOE, which holds the presidency of the country and is the leading force in the Chamber of Deputies, presented a non-law proposition (PNL) in the Spanish Congress to support the launching of a digital euro in response to decreased usage of physical cash, according to an official document cited by the Spanish newspaper El Economista.      New payment trends lead to a “purely private and more insecure money,” according to the political party, while its proposal is committed to “the recovery of money as a public good, more stable and under democratic control.”      PSOE promoted this measure after the European Central Bank (ECB) announced its intentions to create a digital euro, the report added.      Last week, the European Union designated the Bank of Spain and the National Securities Market Commission, Spain’s stock market regulator known as CNMV, to oversee crypto assets in the country.      Carlos Conesa, general director of the financial innovation division at the Spanish Central Bank (Banco de España), said this month that “the decision to launch a project on the digital euro is very close,” the article added.      According to the PSOE, a national digital currency would allow more liquidity in the system. “In the event that a monetary expansion is necessary, it allows a more direct mechanism by injecting liquidity directly into current accounts and thus transferring it immediately and without intermediaries to economic activity,” according to its proposal.      “It would be subject, as at present, ultimately to control by the representatives of the citizenry, who set its monetary policy objectives,” PSOE argued in its PNL presented in Congress, according to the report.      PSOE insisted the project would be achieved “without the nationalization of the banking system or the nationalization of credit.”      A digital currency would end the “privilege” of banks over money, according to the proposal, defining a national digital currency as “a digital public money, intangible and perfectly usable to make electronic payments, but in this case backed by the state, making it a safe money.”      Thus, “it is perfectly feasible that each individual can have his own account with his digital money directly at the central bank. A privilege, for the moment, restricted to banks.”",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET,Andrés Engler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/06/29/spain-considers-implementing-a-digital-euro,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/27c7ed2670380224ac8e4a17bd7ebe2d062f7204-1000x696.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It’d be the broadest expansion of the $25 billion stablecoin to date, potentially surpassing the eight blockchains that support Tether’s USDT, the market leader with a $63 billion market cap.      “We anticipate that in the coming months USDC will become available on Avalanche, Celo, Flow, Hedera, Kava, Nervos, Polkadot, Stacks, Tezos, and Tron,” according to a draft announcement from USDC administrator CENTRE obtained by CoinDesk.      The expansion comes as stablecoins draw increasing scrutiny from regulators, with Eric Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, specifically mentioning USDT and even the relatively obscure TITAN in a recent talk about emerging systemic risks. While Fed Vice Chair Randal Quarles followed with more positive remarks about stablecoins, it is clear the sector is squarely on Washington’s radar.      CENTRE, which is a consortium run by crypto exchange Coinbase and payments firm Circle, said expanding to other chains helps “drive individual and enterprise adoption of open blockchain technologies.”      “We anticipate that USDC on these blockchain platforms and multichain protocols will further accelerate the use of the world’s fastest growing digital dollar currency,” CENTRE said in the draft announcement.      USDC was launched on Ethereum in 2018 and expanded to Algorand, Stellar and Solana in the second half of 2020.      The potential expansion to other blockchains follows a pair of announcements showing momentum behind USDC as an interest-generating savings vehicle. Circle announced its Circle Yield and DeFi API products late last week.      In its draft announcement, CENTRE said updates on the timing of the further integrations would be issued “over the balance of the year.”",POSITIVE,USDT | USDC,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | FIAT | USDT | USDC,Zack Seward,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/06/29/usdc-stablecoin-could-soon-expand-to-10-more-blockchains,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3ff20dcdc35d547860c8ad6486814ba8fbab8d78-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Armstrong wrote that Coinbase expects to add assets to the platform more quickly, broaden its geographic focus to ship products “that work globally” and construct a crypto app store, akin to Apple's.      In the more immediate future, Armstrong wrote, Coinbase would cut the length of its legal review to evaluate asset issuers from 70 to 12 questions and create a more efficient compliance and security review process. Coinbase will also construct what he termed “an experimental zone for new assets” ensuring the company can provide a fuller picture of their risks for customers, and take steps so that users can access “most assets for basic wallet functionality.”      Armstrong promised to send more products to new international markets, while still working with regulators “in more established markets,” and that “any app built on decentralized crypto rails will be accessible to users of the Coinbase app.”      He added that customers would have “the option to do self-custody of their crypto in the main Coinbase app.”",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,James Rubin,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/06/29/ceo-brian-armstrong-flags-self-custody-defi-access-as-coinbase-priorities,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d4e78a1daadff82381303fcedd0e1c84d61e68c6-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Cryptocurrencies are in relief mode as selling pressure from May stabilizes in a tight range between $30,000 and $40,000. Traders are watching for signs of capitulation as bitcoin appears to be oversold and shorts unwind positions.      Crypto markets have been resilient despite regulatory crackdowns in China and the U.K. On Monday, Reuters reported that several companies have abandoned their efforts to register with the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority amid mounting regulatory scrutiny on the industry.      “Prices rising in the face of bad news may be a sign of the seller exhaustion we need to go higher,” David Grider, a strategist at FundStrat, wrote in a newsletter on Monday.    Latest prices    Cryptocurrencies:    Bitcoin (BTC) $36387.21, +5.74%  Ether (ETH) $2221.89, +5.27%    Traditional markets:    S&P 500: 4291.67, +0.025%  Gold: $1761.22, -0.97%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.475%, compared with 1.472% on Monday  Where to from here    “We do think this could continue to be a choppy market for a bit as prices reestablish their trend, and we could even retest the $31K level, but overall, we remain in the bullish camp over the balance of the year,” Grider wrote.      From a technical perspective, bitcoin’s long-term trend remains intact despite the loss of intermediate-term momentum. The $34,000 price level has prevented secondary support near $27,000 from becoming relevant, according to Katie Stockton, managing partner at Fairlead Strategies.      “We would view a breakout above the 50-day moving average [around $38,000] as a positive catalyst supporting a test of secondary resistance near $44K,” Stockton wrote in a report published Monday.      The big economic data point analysts are awaiting this week is Friday’s U.S. jobs report, which could affect assets that are deemed to be risky, including cryptocurrencies.      “If Friday’s employment numbers come in stronger than expected, market participants could anticipate the Fed raising rates sooner than expected,” Alexander Blum, managing partner at digital asset manager Two Prime, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.      A strong jobs report could be bearish for digital assets in the near-term, according to Blum, while a weaker-than-expected number would be bullish.    Returns collide    Bitcoin’s year-to-date return of about 20% is beating the S&P 500 Index, but trailing the Thomson Reuters Core Commodity Index.      Over the past year, bitcoin and ether had a similar risk-adjusted performance to popular U.S. stocks such as Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA).    Bitcoin cycle decoupling    The current bitcoin bull cycle has decoupled from the 2013 and 2017 cycles. This is due to a combination of factors including regulatory crackdowns, environmental concerns and an occasional tweet from Tesla CEO Elon Musk, which interrupted the 2021 bull cycle.      “It’s important to note that each cycle is ultimately unique,” wrote Coin Metrics, in a newsletter published Monday. “Every halving has effectively signaled the start of a new cycle, with the 2013 cycle peaking 370 days after the first halving, and the 2017 cycle peaking 524 days after the second halving.”      Bitcoin is currently 413 days after the third halving, which occurred in May 2020, as shown in the chart below.    Hedge funds unwind short positions    The open interest of bitcoin futures at CME Group in June is at a yearly low, with the open interest currently standing at $1.39 billion, according to data from Skew.      It shows that hedge funds are now unwinding their short positions as cash-and-carry trades, a strategy that aims to exploit differences between spot and futures market, are not lucrative anymore, according to Arcane Research.      Hedge funds were net shorting $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin contracts at its peak, and the number has fallen to $400 million, according to Arcane.    Altcoin roundup  Ethereum transaction fees: Ethereum transaction fees have dropped to their lowest since December because blockchain activity has cooled while use of Ethereum layer 2 solution protocols such as Polygon (MATIC) has heated up. Gas refers to the computational efforts required to execute specific operations on the Ethereum network. A fee, paid in ether, is required to successfully conduct a transaction on Ethereum.  DeFi Meets AI: Fetch.ai, a Cambridge, U.K.-based artificial-intelligence lab with a penchant for crypto, has launched a service to combat the risk of losses across the experimental decentralized finance (DeFi) market. The DeFi Agents toolkit can be set to automatically withdraw users’ funds from Uniswap v2 and PancakeSwap based on predefined conditions such as the exchange rate for a given token dropping to a certain level.

Some 49% of 1,103 respondents to the Investing.com survey said that “bitcoin being environmentally unfriendly"" is an issue for them as an investor, according to a summary of the results posted on the information service’s website.      The survey provides some evidence of how drastically some investors’ opinions on bitcoin changed after Musk tweeted his concerns in May, when he reversed an earlier policy of accepting the cryptocurrency as payment for Tesla's electric vehicles.      Since then, there’s been about a 40%% price drop for the world’s largest cryptocurrency, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index. Cathie Wood, CEO of Ark Investments, said at the Robin Hood Investors Conference on June 16 that the downturn was due to investors’ growing awareness of the sheer amount of electricity it takes to mine the cryptocurrency.    Read more: More Energy-Efficient Blockchains Are Possible. Here's How    Some 70% of investors who took part in Investing.com’s survey said they would favor a more “green” cryptocurrency, while 36% didn’t even realize that bitcoin had environmental implications before Musk’s comments on the issue.      According to Investing.com, 30% of the respondents sold their bitcoin last month, with one in five attributing the decision to Musk’s comments about the environment.      Musk’s tweets on cryptocurrency were seen as “annoying” by 33% of respondents, “unfair” by 22% and “entertaining” by 27%, the summary reads.      “After being hailed and crowned as king of the crypto community, Elon Musk has made himself some new enemies lately, following his recent shock about-face on bitcoin,” said Jesse Cohen, an analyst at Investing.com. “For an asset whose price is driven mostly by psychological sentiment and momentum, bitcoin could have a hard time recovering.”      When respondents were asked if Musk’s “manipulation of cryptocurrency values has changed their view of that investment,” 51% said Musk has “too much power” and 24% said they don’t believe the billionaire has too much influence.

42387209,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBltxV,1624989772,Stablecoins and CBDCs: Private Vs. Public Monetary Innovation,"“We do not need to fear stablecoins,” Randal Quarles, vice chairman for supervision at the Federal Reserve, said in a speech yesterday.      That doesn’t sound like a particularly remarkable statement. Except it came from a Fed official, who might be suspicious about stablecoins but was surprisingly bullish on them.    This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    In a statement to the Utah Bankers Association Annual Convention, Quarles said that privately issued stablecoins (or assets typically pegged to fiat currencies underwritten by a bundle of other financial instruments) could help solve some of the inefficiencies and inequalities in the current payments system. He is intrigued by the instantaneous and cross-border settlements offered by a blockchain-based technology.      Quarles' comments were explicitly framed by the debate over central bank digital currencies (CBDC) and the role of the U.S. government in fostering financial innovation. The big question: Should the U.S. undertake a massive public project to digitize cash – through an alternative consumer deposit infrastructure at the Federal Reserve – or should that be left to the private sector?      Quarles remains skeptical of CBDCs, which he described as a fad, as do many central bankers. The Fed is researching CBDCs and expects to publish a report about the topic this summer. Several senior Fed officials have raised concerns about the risks that stablecoins – which are now worth in excess of $108 billion – present.      “I read [Quarles’] speech as basically a free market-oriented person making the best case they can to let private actors continue doing what they're doing and to hold off on any public alternative,” Willamette University College of Law professor Rohan Grey said in an email. “That's what links the enthusiasm for stablecoins with the pessimism towards CBDCs, in my opinion.” (Grey has argued for an open-source approach to a digital dollar.)    See also: Will a US Digital Dollar Protect Privacy?    According to Quarles, CDBCs could put more stress on the U.S. banking system and pose cybersecurity risks. They might also limit competition between banks that benefits consumers. On a practical level, there may be a host of legislative roadblocks and administrative costs to setting one up. These are just a few of his concerns. Crypto pundits have become anxious about CBDC privacy, with some calling them state-mandated spyware.      Stablecoins are one of the fastest-growing sections of the crypto economy. It’s a financial revolution underway that also raises serious doubts. In Quarles’ own words:    “Stablecoins are an important development that raises difficult questions. For example, how would widespread adoption of stablecoins affect monetary policy or financial stability? How might stablecoins affect the commercial banking system? Do stablecoins represent a fundamental threat to the government's role in money creation?”    But Quarles’ quickly responded to his own questions: “The Federal Reserve has traditionally supported responsible private-sector innovation.” What's more, he said, “Our existing system involves – indeed depends on – private firms creating money every day.”      Although the analogy isn’t perfect, the rise of stablecoins may end up resembling the explosion of consumer credit cards. Those cash equivalents rapidly entered the market and reshaped the economy. Between 1945 and 1960, consumer credit increased from $2.6 billion to $45 billion, according to the Federal Reserve. In 1970, about a decade after Bank of America mailed the first 60,000 charge cards, it stood at $105 billion. About one in six U.S. families held one, according to the Fed.      That growth was entirely a form of private-sector money creation, giving families the ability to buy now and pay later. There are many criticisms of this debt-driven system – some even pointed to by Quarles – but it’s impossible to say it wasn’t a revolution.      Grey’s line is to advocate for strong consumer protections in face of private-sector money creation. He argues that stablecoins should be regulated as deposit takers. Moreover, a large part of the Federal Reserve's mandate has been to limit the efforts of ""shadow banks to engage in traditional banking activity without proper regulation.""      For him, there is a sense of urgency. “The problem is precisely that stablecoins aren't waiting until those concerns have been addressed, they're in circulation now,” he said.

42387194,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBlth9,1624985308,More Energy-Efficient Blockchains Are Possible. Here's How,"The past year has been one of massive growth and transformation for the entire Web 3 industry. Thanks to decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFT), and a rise in interest from traditional finance, excitement for blockchain’s potential has never been higher. With this attention, though, comes new scrutiny. Energy consumption sits right at the top of the list.      While there are differing opinions about Bitcoin’s carbon footprint, and Ethereum is making a gradual transition from a computer-intensive proof-of-work (PoW) model to a more efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) model, blockchains consume a lot of energy. And, I’d argue, for good reason. Blockchains have the ability to not only create entire new multi-billion dollar markets and drive dramatic efficiencies in existing markets. It’s much easier to move $1 million in BTC than move $1 million in gold, for example.    Medha Parlikar has been the CTO of CasperLabs since 2018, and most recently led the team through its public sale and mainnet launch. She is an advocate for greener alternatives to energy intensive blockchains and is focused on building a sustainable, future-proof enterprise network.    Our industry was built by innovators. We’ve defied what many perceive to be possible time after time, and now we must continue to push the technology forward as we face the challenge at hand: to reduce energy consumption across the board without sacrificing security, decentralization and scalability. Our ability to do so as an industry is critical to ensuring this technology can support the evolution of society as a whole.      The environmental issue is growing in importance. In May, we saw Tesla back off of its commitment to accepting BTC payments, only to then keep the door open by noting it’s open to rethinking this approach as less energy-intensive BTC mining models take hold. The Chinese government’s recent crackdown on bitcoin mining in China appears partly related to its environmental impact, at least according to official statements.      A recent power usage study conducted by developers at CasperLabs found the Ethereum and Bitcoin networks respectively account for 33.5 and 95.45 terawatt-hours annually, according to the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance. This means the Bitcoin network consumes more energy than over half of the world's countries each year on an individual basis. And that doesn’t even account for the specialized mining equipment such as custom ASIC solutions and locked GPU configurations that PoW requires that cause another layer of environmental impact that aren’t fully captured in these measurements.      The blockchain sector is just like any other industry in the sense that it’s a mix of outdated, resource-intensive organizations and forward-thinking projects that set new standards for operational efficiency and sustainability. Critics have taken environmental concerns that apply to only a handful of projects and extrapolated these across the entire blockchain industry. It’s only the networks that leverage the PoW consensus mechanism that use high amounts of energy, and it is widely understood that PoS is a more energy-efficient alternative. In fact, Ethereum is now working on transitioning the Ethereum network to a PoS model. (Reality check: Pure PoS won’t be ready until v3.0, and both Ethereum v2.0 and 3.0 have been delayed for years.)      PoW protocols have proven to be resource-intensive because of the way nodes validate network activity. PoW deserves recognition as the consensus mechanism that spurred the blockchain industry, but it’s clear PoW has triggered a never-ending, resource-intensive arms race between crypto miners, who are constantly upgrading their mining equipment to gain an edge over the competition.    Read more: Valid Points: Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake May Happen Sooner Than You Think    Within the blockchain industry, energy consumption is clearly a divisive issue. We’re sitting at a pivotal moment, where we have a choice to actively champion new standards for reducing the industry’s environmental footprint. That standard is PoS, and we need to communicate to the world that there are blockchains that are live and in production today – that leverage PoS to drive a drastic reduction in energy consumption without sacrificing the security guarantees and decentralized nature that underpins the tech.      There is a need for an environmentally friendly enterprise blockchain fully capable of supporting a high volume activity, here and now. PoS networks have stepped up to fill that void. One of the most recent PoS networks to garner attention from devs and enterprises is Casper, a network that is optimized for sustainability due to its novel consensus mechanism, enabling Casper to exceed performance of Bitcoin and Ethereum by using a fraction of the energy.      A recent performance audit demonstrated the Casper network is 47,000% and 136,000% more energy efficient compared to Ethereum and Bitcoin, respectively. Casper even stacks up favorably against other PoS blockchains such as Cosmos, which is 22,000% and 64,000% more efficient than Ethereum and Bitcoin, but only half as efficient than Casper. That is a figure that CEOs care about, and it’s my job to ensure these executives, along with their shareholders, understand how PoS networks are uniquely designed to preserve as much power as possible.      Take Casper’s Highway consensus mechanism for example – a unique variant of PoS where validator nodes certify that each newly proposed block is legitimate using a consistent, predetermined set of guiding principles. If the block is appended, each participating validator receives a reward proportional to their bond, while validators that do not contribute forgo their block rewards and are ejected.    Read more: The Frustrating, Maddening, All-Consuming Bitcoin Energy Debate | Nic Carter    And because developer communities continue to find new ways to improve the efficiency of these networks, it's critical for smart contracts to be independently upgradeable, preventing the disruption caused to regular on-chain activity when the entire network is upgraded. This is essential, as it makes it easier to introduce and scale new features – a time-consuming challenge Ethereum has faced in its transition from PoW to PoS.      Our ability to achieve measurable sustainability goals has become an urgent priority for society writ large, and industry leaders and regulators alike need to recognize that eco-friendliness should not be an optional feature to be built out later. Three-fourths of the world’s 250 largest companies now have targets in place to reduce their carbon emissions, and it’s important to continue raising awareness around this issue. Shareholders are increasingly demanding this, not just due to regulatory demands but because it’s proven to drive better business outcomes. A recent Harvard Business School study found companies that developed processes to measure, manage and communicate performance on sustainability goals in the early 1990s outperformed those that did not over the next two decades.      Blockchain proponents need to do a better job of directly addressing valid concerns as they arise, and I personally think every dev team that’s confident in what they’re doing should relish the opportunity to pressure-test their ideas in a public forum. We need to encourage everyone in a position of influence to ask the hard questions about what we’re doing to make our tech more sustainable, because the best way to hold people to higher standards is to provide specific and actionable critiques when warranted, and give credit where it’s due.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MINING,Medha Parlikar,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/06/29/more-energy-efficient-blockchains-are-possible-heres-how,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d04b66b8831490250e7da52ec56d007f9ce836ed-1400x933.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42387197,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBltkv,1624981557,Gerald Cotten and Quadriga: Unraveling Crypto's Biggest Mystery,"When Ameer and Raees Caji disappeared last week along with 69,000 bitcoins belonging to customers of their Africrypt exchange, they were continuing a time-honored crypto tradition. Since Bitcoin first appeared, there have been dozens and perhaps hundreds of “exit scams,” in which the heads of exchanges or token projects suddenly disappeared with user or investor funds.      One of the most notorious apparent “exit scams” was the collapse of Canadian exchange QuadrigaCX. In early 2019, the exchange disclosed, months after the fact, that founder Gerald Cotten had died of complications from Crohn’s disease while on a trip to India. His sudden death, according to the exchange, had cut off access to the “cold wallets” holding $145 million in customer tokens. Withdrawals were frozen and the firm eventually entered bankruptcy.    David Z. Morris is CoinDesk's chief insights columnist.    Angry customers and inquisitive journalists, naturally, did not take claims of Cotten’s death at face value. Instead, they started digging and quickly realized that Gerald Cotten had never been quite the upstanding citizen his clean-cut image suggested. Speculation quickly spread that Cotten had faked his death and emptied out the Quadriga piggy bank.      “Exit Scam” is a new podcast that pulls together all the strands of the complex Quadriga story into a compelling eight-part yarn. The show is produced and hosted by Aaron Lammer, also a host of the ""Longform"" podcast, and it offers some truly surprising insights into the case’s core question: Did Gerald Cotten really die in India from complications of Crohn’s disease? Or did he steal customer funds with plans to disappear forever?      The surprising answer that seems increasingly plausible after listening to ""Exit Scam"" is: “Both.”      “I think it’s been pretty well proven that Cotten was criminal in the way he operated his exchange,” says Lammer. “And he strategically extracted crypto from that exchange over time with the intent to defraud his users.”      According to postmortem findings by auditor Ernst & Young, Cotten used fake accounts on his own exchange to buy customers’ bitcoin using Canadian dollars that didn’t exist, and then moved those stolen tokens to take risky bets on other exchanges. Cotten had also taken flying lessons and made other preparations that would have been useful for a life on the lam. His will was signed just two weeks before the ill-fated India trip, and included C$100,000 (US$81,000) left to his two dogs. Most shocking of all, the mild-mannered Canadian had a track record of deception and theft going back to his teenage years.      And yet, according to every piece of evidence Lammer could dig up, Gerald Cotten really did die unexpectedly in India. “Exit Scam” includes interviews with journalists who retraced Cotten’s death, and found no credible evidence of forgery, body doubles or other foul play. Canadian law enforcement agencies seem satisfied, and have refused to exhume Cotten’s body for DNA testing.      What happened to Cotten’s wife, Jennifer Robertson, strikes me as the clearest evidence that his death was truly accidental. Robertson accompanied him to the hospital where he died, and so would have had to be a knowing collaborator if his death was faked. But if she was a collaborator, she didn’t get much for her trouble: Robertson appears to have walked away with next to none of the remaining ill-gotten Quadriga money that for a time fueled the couple’s luxurious, globe-trotting lifestyle. Even Cotten’s dogs wound up empty-pawed.    The happy scammer    Even if it doesn’t solve the Quadriga mystery, “Exit Scam” is worth your while for its insights into an even stranger question: What made Gerald Cotten a lifelong and passionate thief?      Cotten’s history of malfeasance, uncovered in part by investigator Amy Castor, began when he was just 15 years old. That was when he entered the shady world of online “high-yield investment programs” (aka HYIPs, aka Ponzi schemes). It was through that world that he became familiar with digital currencies: Well before Bitcoin even existed, Cotten was working with future QuadrigaCX co-founder Michael Patryn to help HYIP operators and others redeem or move their eGold, a gold-backed digital token later shut down by the FBI for its role in money laundering.      The postmortem discovery of Cotten’s long history of illicit involvements was shocking in part because the soft-spoken Canadian appeared to be trustworthy and mild-mannered to many. “Exit Scam” features interviews with longtime crypto veterans who worked closely with Cotten and found him entirely credible.      Moreover, Cotten would have had plenty of money thanks to his genuinely visionary early stake in crypto. “He was a presale Ethereum buyer,” Lammer points out. “If he’d never gotten involved in the exchange, he would have been rich.”      Some of the blame for Cotten’s dark path may lie with Michael Patryn. Patryn, a fellow Canadian whose role at QuadrigaCX had been occasionally nebulous, was one of the first threads investigators pulled after Cotten’s death. It was quickly discovered that Patryn’s real name was Omar Dhanani – he had changed it after being convicted of identity fraud and spending time in federal prison in the U.S. Patryn was an older, seasoned operator when he met Cotten on an HYIP message board, and they quickly became collaborators.      But Lammer thinks Cotten’s own thrill-seeking was just as much of a factor as any bad influence. “My read was that, on some level, Gerry was addicted to scamming,” the host says. “Addicted to stealing people’s money. This was more of a gambler’s high than a rich guy’s high … as he pursued more and more of other people’s money, the stakes went up.”      All that helps explain the seemingly implausible coincidence that Cotten died at the exact point when he stood to benefit most from disappearing. Cotten a) had a serious medical condition, and b) had been in the middle of one illicit financial operation or another for years. He could have died at nearly any moment since 2010 and been plausibly suspected of faking it to disappear with somebody’s money.    Read more: Most Influential 2019: Mystery Man (Profile of Gerald Cotten)    Gerald’s final thrill may have come from his misuse of customer funds in the months leading up to his death. Cotten created a Quadriga customer account under the false name “Chris Markay” and funded it with fictitious Canadian dollars. He used those fake dollars to buy customers’ cryptocurrencies, and then moved them to other exchanges. “He was putting money on other exchanges and doing risky, degen stuff with it,” says Lammer. Most importantly, Cotten wound up very long ETH.      That turned out to be a very bad bet: ETH crashed by more than 90% over the course of 2018, and stayed in the basement until late 2020. According to an investigation by the Ontario Securities Commission, Cotten’s huge speculative losses on bets made with stolen customer funds made up the bulk of roughly C$115 million ($93 million USD) missing from QuadrigaCX’s balance sheet in the final accounting.      Gerald Cotten’s gambling before his death, rather than a fake death enabling an exit scam, seems to be why Quadriga’s cold wallets were empty. That C$115 million “was more money than Quadriga made the entire time it was in business,” Lammer says. “That’s not just an 'L.' You can’t recover.”    Crime doesn’t pay (no, seriously)    This is how the story usually ends for habitual gamblers, of any stripe. Whether you’re pushing regulatory boundaries, hoping nobody comes after you when a pyramid scheme collapses, or just day-trading shitcoins, the thrill of winning can make bigger risks seem appealing. But of course, everyone loses eventually – and by the time Cotten started losing, his bets were more than big enough to wipe out a lifetime of gains. Though the extent of his personal crypto holdings remain largely opaque, there simply wasn’t much left to take from QuadrigaCX by late 2018.      So while it doesn’t definitively answer the mystery of Gerald Cotten, “Exit Scam” still rewrites the story we thought we knew.      “We thought we were looking for basically a rich guy who had stolen money,” says Lammer. “Now either [Cotten is] dead, or if he’s alive, he’s a gambling addict who’s broke.”",NEGATIVE,ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | FIAT,David Z.

The company has designed an orb-shaped unit that can produce a unique personal identifier from an iris scan, Bloomberg reported Tuesday.

""I've been interested in things like universal basic income and what's going to happen to global wealth distribution and how we can do that better, is there a way we can use technology to do that at a global scale,"" Altman said to Bloomberg.

The account isn’t FDIC- or SIPC-insured and functions much like other products at crypto lenders and other exchanges that regularly offer yields around 8%. The reason why Coinbase is offering a comparatively lower yield is because it doesn’t lend to “unidentified third parties,” said Thorsten Jaeckel, senior product manager at Coinbase.      Coinbase, which administers the USDC stablecoin in partnership with Circle through the CENTRE Consortium, appears to be aiming squarely for banks with its new product, touting rates “more than 50x the national average of a traditional savings account.”      The account is geared towards retail users and the yield is created by Coinbase lending out the USDC to “verified borrowers,” Jaeckel told CoinDesk via email.      It’s the second USDC savings product advertising 4% APY in as many days.

42387211,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBltyl,1624973400,State of Crypto: Inside the NRCC's Plan to Accept Crypto Donations,"The National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC) is the first major congressional campaign group to accept cryptocurrencies in the U.S. Its chair, Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) says this move comes at donors’ request.    You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Political donations  The narrative    The NRCC is among the first major political groups in the U.S. to accept cryptocurrency donations, which could signal further acceptance of virtual assets as a value transfer tool. What’s more interesting is this adoption is being spearheaded by crypto champion Tom Emmer, a congressman from Minnesota and the NRCC’s chair. He says it’s coming from because some donors want to pay in crypto.    Why it matters    Cryptocurrency adoption in the U.S. will be driven partly by how crypto is used, and partly by how it’s perceived. U.S. lawmakers accepting crypto for donations may have an impact on both these aspects. Lawmakers receiving crypto will become more comfortable with it, which could lead to more awareness and maybe even positive sentiment toward crypto usage during congressional hearings.    Breaking it down    The National Republican Congressional Committee will accept crypto donations in the near future, after having announced the move earlier this month. BitPay, a payment processor four months removed from settling sanctions violation charges, will convert cryptocurrencies into fiat before sending the donations to the campaign wing.      “This is something that I was interested in doing here at the NRCC last cycle, but really what’s happened is I started to get donors saying ‘I would contribute crypto if you take crypto,’” Emmer said of the move.      Emmer’s own campaign has accepted crypto since August 2020, after working with BitPay last year.      “We've been talking about this ever since I've had this job and my campaign started accepting cryptocurrency,” Emmer said. “In fact I think Jared Polis (D-Colo.) might have been the first member of Congress to accept cryptocurrencies for his campaign, and I'm not sure why others didn't follow suit.”      Dotting the I’s and crossing the T’s took less than a month after the final decision was made, he said.      The Federal Election Commission (FEC) has allowed political campaigns to accept crypto since 2014. Emmer said the NRCC’s team has worked with the election watchdog to ensure NRCC donations are above board.      “My understanding is that our lawyers cleared this with the FEC with ethics, that’s all been addressed. My office, we did [speak to the FEC] for my personal campaign,” he said.      Still, it’s unclear when the NRCC will actually begin accepting crypto. A spokesperson for BitPay said the committee was still being integrated.      When the feature goes live, donors can donate bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ether, XRP, dogecoin, DAI, wrapped bitcoin, USDC, GUSD, PAX and Binance USD.      These potential crypto donors want Congress to take more action on the virtual currency industry, he said.      “I've been engaging with this community all across the country now for more than just the last two years, and I would say with each month the engagement grows,” Emmer said.      He pointed to plans to provide financial services to unbanked individuals as one example.      “Frankly, the last administration had fits and starts in this area,” he said. “If we don't get moving on this, you're going to have a whole bunch of really smart entrepreneurs, and the capital that they are raising to create these opportunities, leaving the United States to start these things elsewhere.”    Biden’s rule  Changing of the guard    Nothing new to report here.

Announced Tuesday, the DeFi Agents toolkit can be set to automatically withdraw users’ funds from Uniswap v2 and PancakeSwap based on predefined conditions such as the exchange rate for a given token dropping to a certain level.      While cryptocurrency prices are weakening, DeFi innovation is booming, with lots of insurance-like projects and even DeFi-focused blockchain analytics in the offing.      Fetch.ai, which has applied its machine-learning chops to enterprise blockchain as well as public crypto, is preventing losses associated with decentralized-exchange (DEX) trading and the use of automated market makers (AMMs) by liquidity providers, the participants who deposit tokens on DeFi platforms in order to earn yields.    Read more: A16z Leads $12M Investment in DeFi-Native Crypto Tracing Firm Nansen    Currently, the DeFi Agent tool provides “stop-loss agents,” which can automatically withdraw user funds from liquidity pools. These kick in if the exchange rate between the two tokens falls to a predetermined level, according to a press release. In traditional trading, a stop-loss order is a parameter that triggers a purchase or sale of a specific asset once it reaches a given price. At launch, users will be able to create up to five agents with stop-loss triggers for all liquidity pools on Uniswap and PancakeSwap, a Binance Smart Chain-based DEX.      The Fetch.ai team plans to extend the functionality of the DeFi Agent tool to enable automatic liquidity withdrawal and deposit when token sentiment goes below a certain threshold; to move liquidity of ERC-20s or BEP-20s to a defined range if the price is breached (in Uniswap v3); and to remove liquidity if ETH fees are becoming too high in a given period of time, according to the release.      “Intelligent automation has the potential to transform the end-to-end experience of the DeFi applications we use today,” Humayun Sheikh, CEO of Fetch.ai, said in a statement, adding:    “Rather than constantly monitoring price action and having to manually withdraw liquidity, Fetch.ai DeFi Agents simplify and streamline that whole process for LPs.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | SPONSORED | TRADING | UNI,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/06/29/defi-meets-ai-fetchai-launches-intelligent-automation-for-uniswap-v2-and-pancakeswap,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/da1da00a41c3aa0534bc0a70cedb91c76c938a1a-1500x1179.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42387204,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBltsT,1624966236,Bitcoin's 'Puell Multiple' Flashes Misleading Bullish Signal as China Bans Mining,"While a key bitcoin indicator shows the currency is undervalued and ripe for a price bounce, the reading might be misleading, one observer says.      ""The Puell Multiple is flashing a buy signal,"" Ben Lilly, a crypto economist at Jarvis Labs, noted in a Substack post published on Monday. The metric, however, is tied to miners and may be distorted by China's mining ban, he said.      The multiple, the ratio of the daily issuance of bitcoin in U.S. dollar terms and the 365-day moving average of the daily issuance value, has dropped below 0.5. That indicates the value of the newly issued bitcoin daily is relatively low compared with historical standards.      A sub-0.5 reading on the indicator created by analyst David Puell has marked miner capitulation and bear market bottoms in the past, according to data provided by lookintobitcoin.com.      Daily issuance refers to the number of new coins supplied to the ecosystem by miners, who receive them as rewards for mining blocks and approving transactions. Miners mainly operate on cash and sell coins almost daily.      The latest reading may raise hopes for a bull market resumption. Lilly says it should be taken ""with a grain of salt.""      That's because the ratio's drop into the green zone follows a slide in the hash rate and the daily issuance caused by China's mining ban. It doesn't necessarily imply miner capitulation.      China reiterated its long-held crypto mining ban in mid-May and stepped up its efforts this month, ordering miners based in Sichuan and other mining hubs to shut down their operations.      As a result, the hash rate, a measure of the computational power working to secure the bitcoin blockchain network, declined from 140 exahashes per second (EH/s) to a 14-month low of 94 EH/s.      With miners going offline, the 30-day average of the daily issuance – coins mined and supplied – has declined from more than 900 BTC to 760 BTC, according to Glassnode data. According to Lilly, the average daily issuance has nearly halved from 900 BTC. Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency has traded mainly in the range of $30,000 to $40,000 this month.      The data confirm the Puell Multiple has entered the buy zone mainly because of China-based miners going offline – a move that's like to be temporary as there is evidence of miners shifting bases to other countries like the U.S. and Kazakhstan.      ""This is a one-off event, meaning most of this mining power will return, and before you know it, MORE than 900 coins per day will be mined since the hash rate will hit the network after the difficulty of each block decreases,"" Lilly noted.      Bitcoin is currently trading near $35,600, a 3% gain on the day, according to CoinDesk 20 data. While there is evidence of dip-demand for the cryptocurrency, a sustained accumulation by large investors might be needed to restore the battered market confidence and revive the bull run.

Nansen, a DeFi-native crypto tracer, has raised $12 million in a Series A funding round led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z). Also participating in the round was Skyfall Ventures, Coinbase Ventures, imToken Ventures, Mechanism Capital and QCP Capital.      Tracking crypto as it flows from wallets to exchanges and other platforms has become a whole sub-industry within the digital-asset space, with major funding rounds for Chainalysis, CipherTrace and TRM Labs in recent weeks.      But blockchain analytics is often associated with regulators and law enforcement, meaning that, perhaps unfairly, it has a boomer feel about it. Not so for Singapore-based Nansen.      “Blockchain analytics has been focused on law enforcement, government agencies, tax authorities and so forth,” said Nansen CEO Alex Svanevik. “But our philosophy has always been that people on the ground floor of crypto, the actual market participants, should have access to the best on-chain analytics as well.”    Crypto-tracking boom    Since the explosion of interest in DeFi, Nansen’s take has been to track flows of money between different smart contracts, identifying the hottest yield farming platform, for example. Currently, the platform has labeled some 90 million addresses, equating to about 70% of all on-chain DeFi volume, according to Svanevik.      “As participation in the first truly open global financial markets grows, traders and collectors of all kinds – retail novices, institutional professionals, independent experts and more – will want to understand what the smart money is doing across all blockchains,” a16z General Partner Chris Dixon said in a statement.

Deutsche Börse said its investment was in the ""moderate"" three-digit Swiss franc million range. Given that 100 million Swiss francs are currently valued at US$108.6 million, the price has to be at least that much.      The exchange said the deal extends its offering for digital assets by providing a direct entry point for investments, including post-trade services such as custody. Switzerland-based Crypto Finance offers 24/7 trading and brokerage of more than 200 digital assets in combination with in-house custody.      Through connections to a variety digital asset venues worldwide, Crypto Finance bridges the problem of liquidity fragmentation in the market, Deutsche Börse said. Professional and institutional clients can directly invest in digital assets, without having to set-up their own infrastructure and operational frameworks, the exchange said.      Deutsche Börse said its goal is to create a neutral, transparent, and highly scalable digital asset ecosystem under European regulation.

""There is increasing demand from established financial institutions who are looking to become active in this new asset class and want a trusted partner.”      Grabbing a stake in the Swiss firm is not Deutsche Börse’s first foray into cryptocurrency custody, however, as it was originally a member of the Swiss-based Custodigit consortium alongside Swisscom and digital asset bank Sygnum – but has since left the group.      The Frankfurt Stock Exchange owner has now found another road into custody, with a particular focus on Switzerland as well as Singapore, where Crypto Finance also has a presence.      Crypto Finance founder and CEO Jan Brzezek will continue to run the business.      The transaction is expected to close in Q4 following regulatory approvals.

Citing copyright infringement brought forward by nChain Chief Scientist Craig Wright, the judge had no option but to rule a default judgment because Cobra chose not to make an appearance, Wright's representation, Ontier LLP, said via a statement on Monday.      Judge David Hodge, QC issued an injunction prohibiting Cobra from infringing Wright's copyright in the U.K., either through making the white paper accessible for download on the website or ""in any other way.""      An order requiring bitcoin.org to publish a copy of the court's order was also issued while an inquiry will be established to determine the damages caused by Cobra against Wright, Ontier said.      Bitcoin.org is an independent open-source project that aims to support Bitcoin development. The website and its operator have been embroiled in a sparing of legal threats.      Proceedings were issued on Feb. 24 of this year in the Intellectual Property List of the Business and Property Courts of England and Wales. In April, Wright was granted permission to serve Cobra and sought a declaration that he owns the copyright to the Bitcoin white paper, claiming Cobra was infringing his rights.      Since at least the start of this year, the website has said that it believes Wright’s claims are “without merit” and has refused to take the paper down. Ontier said Wright did not wish to restrict access to ""his"" paper but instead he did not agree with its use by supporters and developers of ""alternative assets.""      “... To promote or otherwise misrepresent those assets as being Bitcoin given that they do not support or align with the vision for Bitcoin as he set out in his White Paper,” said Simon Cohen, senior associate at Ontier.      Wright purports to be Bitcoin's creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. Though the true identity of Nakamoto has never been revealed, Wright's attempt to threaten those disseminating the white paper runs contrary to the spirit of Bitcoin, said Cobra on Tuesday.      “What is especially concerning is when monikers like @CobraBitcoin make big, public statements about coming to court to confirm their comments about me and Bitcoin but, inevitably, then, evade the reality,"" Wright told CoinDesk via email. ""Moreover, they have also directly asked for donations to said court case. I would hope that any funds donated will be duly returned by @CobraBitcoin or at least declared as income for tax purposes.""      See also: Bitcoin.org Rebuts Craig Wright’s ‘Meritless’ Copyright Claim on Bitcoin White Paper      Cobra defended his choice not to appear in court, telling CoinDesk via Twitter:      ""Unfortunately, the court rules allowed for me to be sued pseudonymously, however, I couldn't defend myself pseudonymously. So I was put in an impossible situation of losing my privacy or losing the case in a default judgment. It sucks, but there's nothing more I could have done, really.""
