42412756,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl5x5G,1678146474,Silvergate’s Struggles Will Likely Boost Stablecoins’ Role in Crypto Trading: Kaiko,"Ailing Silvergate Capital’s decision to shutter its instant settlement service SEN, which was popular among large investors, will boost the role of stablecoins and their issuers in crypto trading, market research firm Kaiko said in a report published Monday.  Silvergate is a key banking partner to many digital asset firms, and its SEN platform has been a widely used vehicle for institutional investors to send money to crypto exchanges. As the bank delayed filing its annual report last week and warned about possible regulatory inquiries, multiple firms, including Coinbase, Circle, Paxos, Binance.US, Galaxy Digital and Gemini suspended transfers and operations with Silvergate.  “With the death of SEN, stablecoins will likely become even more ubiquitous among traders,” the Kaiko report said.  Instead of depositing dollars to crypto exchanges using banking rails, Kaiko predicts that traders will transfer money to stablecoin issuers to get stablecoins, and then deposit stablecoins to exchanges.  “The problem is, though, that stablecoin issuers still need access to a crypto bank, so the risk is now further concentrated,” the report added.  Read more: What's the Point of Stablecoins? The Reasons, Risks and Types to Know  Decline of U.S. dollars in trading  Stablecoins such as Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC have become the cornerstone of crypto markets, replacing government-issued fiat currencies such as the U.S. dollar to buy and sell cryptocurrencies. The number of fiat trading pairs has declined globally as stablecoins has grown, Kaiko said.  Of particular note, the role of the U.S. dollar in crypto trading has been dropping steadily. Last year, the number of new dollar trading pairs on exchanges fell to 326 from 400 in 2021, Kaiko data shows.  “Since the FTX collapse, USD market share has fallen consistently relative to USDT, USDC and euro trading pairs,” the report said.  For instance, USDT’s dominance in bitcoin (BTC) trading volumes has recently reached an all-time high of 93% versus the U.S. dollar, according to Kaiko, a spectacular rise from only 3% in 2017.  “For now, the dollar and dollar-pegged stablecoins remain the foundation of the crypto-economy, but growing complications with USD payment rails could upend this trend,” the report said.

The 300-edition generative art project, which opened its auction on Sunday, awarded NFTs to the top 288 successful bidders at the conclusion of the auction at 6 p.m. ET. According to TwelveFold's website, Yuga Labs reserved 12 inscriptions for ""contributors, future donations and philanthropic efforts.""  According to Yuga Labs, there were 3,246 total bidders and the auction generated 735.7 BTC (about $16.5 million).  The 288 NFTs minted will be inscribed onto satoshis, the smallest denomination of bitcoin (BTC), on the Bitcoin blockchain. One token sold for as high as 7.1159 BTC, or about $159,600 at the time of writing, while the lowest accepted bid was 2.2501 BTC, or about $50,400. A directory of all TwelveFold ordinals will be published following the inscription process.  Successful buyers needed to supply a self-custodial wallet that contained bitcoin and an empty bitcoin address to receive the art.  Yuga Labs specified that the collection will not have any future utility or interact with any other of its Ethereum-based projects. Michael Figge, co-founder of NFT studio WENEW and its popular flagship NFT project 10KTF, was the artist behind the 3D project.  Figge said in a tweet thread the TwelveFold art was inspired by ""the relationship between time, mathematics and the blockchain.""  ""Like crypto, the collection isn't so much linear but cyclical, with four different color palettes progressing throughout: winter, spring, summer, autumn. It's a nod to being optimistic whether we're in a Crypto Winter or a DeFi Summer,"" he explained.  Yuga Labs announced plans for the TwelveFold collection last week as its first foray into the Bitcoin-based Ordinals protocol. Many experts have pointed to the new phenomenon in the crypto space as a catalyst for bitcoin’s price jump.

42412750,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl5x1W,1678143777,Bitcoin Continues Trading Sideways at $22.4K as Silvergate Concerns Mount,"Bitcoin edged higher to top $22,500 early Monday before retreating slightly below that mark in the afternoon.  The largest cryptocurrency by market value was recently trading above $22,400 and squarely in the narrow range it’s occupied since Thursday when traders liquidated some $78 million in long positions amid worries about Silvergate Capital. Bitcoin (BTC) had been trading at around $23,500 for much of the previous week winding into February.  “It seems the more Wall Street positions itself for a major sell-off with risky assets, markets refuse to break,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst at foreign exchange market maker Oanda, wrote in an email.  In a newsletter Monday, Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at digital asset investment firm Arca, wrote that the crypto market’s stability in recent days suggested the drop in price late Thursday “may have been just a single seller (or small group of sellers) rather than a market-wide panic.”  ETH, the second-largest cryptocurrency, was recently changing hands at $1,569, up 0.4% from Sunday, same time. The CoinDesk Market Index, which measures overall crypto market performance, was flat for the day.  BTC and ETH have tumbled about 3.1% and 2.5%, respectively, over the past seven days. A report from crypto data firm Kaiko highlighted that the funding rates of these two assets turned negative last week, suggesting bearish market sentiment.  California-based Silvergate said in a filing last week that ​​the impact of recent events – notably the FTX exchange collapse and subsequent regulatory actions – raised questions about the bank's ability to ""continue as a going concern.” In the ensuing days, industry fallout has widened with multiple businesses including Coinbase and Paxos cutting ties with the bank. Shares of Silvergate (SI) closed down 6.2% Monday.  “Silvergate made the mistake of merging traditional banking with a centralized cryptocurrency exchange model,” Sheraz Ahmed, managing partner at blockchain consultancy Storm Partners, told CoinDesk. Ahmed sees an increasing likelihood of the crypto market contracting as the industry endures fresh liquidity crises.  “The first crypto bull market to attract institutional involvement ended not too long ago, and many still needed to prepare for a steep market drop,” he said. “Unfortunately, those that didn't are paying the price.”  On Friday, Silvergate Capital terminated its Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN), the instant payment service that allowed real-time crypto-to-fiat transfers between investors and exchanges. But in an interview with CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” Monday, Hany Rashwan, CEO of crypto investment product firm 21.co, said the closure of the SEN platform didn’t necessarily have “a material impact” on BTC’s price.  Eric Chen, CEO and co-founder of Injective Labs, the company behind the DeFi protocol Injective, noted in an email to CoinDesk that it's important to monitor whether exchanges that previously used SEN service can “smoothly integrate new payment partners” to “ensure uninterrupted settlement speed and volume.”  “It’s crucial to remember that properly capitalized and managed exchanges should be able to weather this storm with minimal disruption to their operations,” he added.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/03/06/bitcoin-continues-trading-sideways-at-224k-as-silvergate-concerns-mount,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/40a405f4304de7b04bb0d6f3b92f96b9fa65eb6d-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42412739,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl5wqI,1678143064,Hermès Asks Court for Control Over MetaBirkin NFTs,"French luxury house Hermès International has asked a New York court to block non-fungible token (NFT) artist Mason Rothschild from selling or promoting his MetaBirkin NFTs following a landmark jury verdict last month.  Hèrmes filed suit against Rothschild in January 2022 alleging that the Los Angeles-based creator stole its intellectual property to create his 100-edition non-fungible token (NFT) collection based on the house's iconic Birkin bag. After a lengthy legal battle, a nine-person jury ruled in favor of Hermès last month, awarding the brand $133,000 in damages.  On Friday, Hèrmes asked Judge Jed S. Rakoff of the United States District Court, Southern District of New York (SDNY) to permanently block Rothschild from selling, promoting or distributing NFTs that use the brand's Birkin trademark.  The fashion house also asked that Rothschild transfer control of any Metabirkin NFTs in his possession to a crypto wallet designated by Hèrmes, and that he transfer control of the MetaBirkins smart contract, MetaBirkins domain names and MetaBirkins social media handles to Hèrmes.  The brand further asked that Rothschild transfer royalties received from the MetaBirkins project to them. Hèrmes claims that Rothschild is still receiving a 7.5% creator royalty on NFT marketplace LooksRare. According to data on Etherscan, the last sale of a MetaBirkin NFT took place in November 2022 for 1.2 wrapped ether (about $1,555), while the last transfer of a MetaBirkin NFT between wallets took place in December 2022.  Rothschild's attorney, Rhett Millsaps, called the filing ""a gross overreach by Hèrmes and an attempt to punish Mr. Rothschild because they don’t like his art."" He told CoinDesk that he and his team will be filing a response on Friday.  ""This case is far from over,"" he added.

42412752,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl5x3O,1678141673,"Tornado Cash Fork, Privacy Pools, Deployed on Optimism Testnet","Privacy Pools, an open-source research project and forked successor of coin mixer Tornado Cash, was deployed on the testnet of layer 2 scaling system Optimism this past weekend.  Like Tornado Cash, Privacy Pools allows users to make anonymous transactions, but the defining difference between the two privacy tools stems from how Privacy Pools uses zero-knowledge proofs to prove that funds in the anonymous transactions are not connected to criminal activity.  In August 2022, Tornado Cash, a popular privacy tool on the Ethereum blockchain that pools transactions to obfuscate senders and recipients, was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) for its role in North Korea’s money-laundering operations. In the same week, Tornado Cash’s web developer, Alexey Pertsev, was arrested.  While OFAC sanctioned Tornado Cash, making it illegal for U.S. citizens to use the coin mixer, Tornado Cash has averaged $7.87 million in deposits and $5.97 million in withdrawals per week in 2023, “on track to anonymize ~$250M in 2023,” tweeted Ameen Soleimani, a developer for Privacy Pools.  Privacy Pools improves on what Tornado Cash couldn’t do: It allows users to prove their funds are not associated with criminal activity such as North Korea’s $625 million hack on play-to-earn gaming giant, Axie Infinity.  How Privacy Pools works  According to the protocol’s Github technical documents, “Users can voluntarily remove themselves from an anonymity set containing stolen or laundered funds … This design aims to be a crypto-native solution that allows the community to defend against hackers abusing the anonymity of honest users without requiring blanket regulation or sacrificing on crypto ideals.”  With Privacy Pools, users deposit their funds into a common pool and withdraw their funds into a new wallet address that is untraceable and unlinkable to any prior transaction history, using zero-knowledge proofs that allow for information to be verified, such as a transaction on a blockchain, without leaking specific details of the transaction.  As more people choose to opt out of anonymity sets that contain stolen or laundered funds, the number of sets available for hackers and malicious actors to use shrinks. As such, the protocol gives users “the option to help regulators isolate funds, without revealing their entire transaction history,” added Soleimani.  Privacy Pools is in its “version zero” with future iterations to come. The protocol is still experimental code and has not been audited. Soleimani said, “This is an opportunity to prove the ingenuity of the crypto community to self-regulate and to showcase the awesome power of zero-knowledge proofs.”",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | AXS | BLOCKCHAIN | MINING | REGULATION,Sage D.

42411190,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glLs39,1678138529,Crypto’s Banking Problem Is Not Ironic,"The institution of personal banking is incredibly powerful.  You don’t even need to read a research report or some harrowing personal account to prove it. Instead, just pretend for a moment that all your bank accounts are frozen. Your credit cards don’t work either.  How will you get on?  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Well, hopefully you have a stash of cash under your mattress. Or you have bitcoin and you live near enough places that genuinely participate in the Bitcoin circular economy. Maybe you live in Argentina and you can use a crypto dollar stablecoin like tether because your sovereign currency has let you down since the 1980s.  Otherwise, you’re in a tough place.  The low-hanging fruit here is a clear call to action: We need more of these circular crypto economies. Communities, counties, states, entire countries – an example being El Salvador’s Bitcoin Beach – that operate completely separate from the legacy banking system.  But while these circular economies continue to build out, banking and crypto are still intimately tied. Just look at last week’s news dominated by Silvergate Bank running into a brick wall of trouble that was punctuated by its stock (SI) losing over 50% of its value on Thursday.  Before Silvergate and after Silvergate  Silvergate is the bank for a lot of crypto businesses that tend to have problems maintaining banking relationships.  Silvergate opening up its doors to crypto is viewed as a critical juncture for crypto businesses, especially crypto exchanges. My colleague Daniel Kuhn highlighted as much in a piece published last week titled “Before Silvergate and After Silvergate” borrowing from a quote by now-disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried about how life was better for crypto companies with Silvergate in the fold.  If we look at crypto exchanges, Silvergate is so well-liked because a) it gives access to banking in the first place and b) Silvergate ran the Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN). SEN, which was recently disabled, allowed 24/7 instant settlement between Silvergate bank clients at any time, including nights and weekends. It functioned sort of like how Venmo or CashApp settles debts between friends for late-night ramen or pizza or whatever. Access to SEN attracted a lot of crypto exchange clients including Binance.US, Kraken and Gemini.  And then the FTX collapse happened, which had Silvergate customers antsy and led to billions of dollars in deposit withdrawals. Silvergate subsequently dipped into the Federal Home Loan Bank system to prop up operations.  Things were obviously tough for Silvergate (and other crypto banks, surely), and it got even tougher when U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) sent Silvergate a scathing letter while the White House was publishing blog posts about its crypto concerns. Cue even more withdrawals from Silvergate and the shutdown of the lauded SEN last week.  To be clear, the regulators and politicians didn't actually say crypto exchanges and companies shouldn’t be banked, but they injected uncertainty into the industry. And the funny thing about Silvergate is that it didn’t run into issues because it was making loans using bitcoin and crypto as collateral. It ran into issues because of a bank run. A bank run encouraged by the U.S. government.  This is where a good argument about the potential ill effects of Choke Point 2.0 comes into play, to use CoinDesk columnist and venture capitalist Nic Carter’s phrase. I’m not going to dive into the intimate details of Choke Point 2.0 (basically the idea that the government can threaten regulation against banks if they service certain companies or certain industries), but I want to tackle the banking problem in engenders.  Crypto’s banking problem is not ironic  Silvergate’s issues have made it somewhat obvious now that crypto does in fact have a banking problem. And most crypto critics see this and say: Crypto was made to skirt the banking system, it’s really funny that crypto needs banks to skirt the banking system.  Funny? Well, maybe. But I’m not laughing.  First off, banks and crypto can coexist (yes, even in a hyperbitcoinized world) and in my view they will and should. Just because the option to opt out of using a bank exists with bitcoin or some other crypto doesn’t mean that everyone will shun banks entirely. In fact, honest banking can be a net positive.  There will, of course, be (and are) a hardcore subset of self-sovereign individuals who buck third parties entirely, but there are billions of people in this world. Organization of those people is far easier with some reliance on third parties. The world that bitcoin and crypto can encourage is a world where those third parties are more honest. More honest banks in the business of keeping your money safe and providing responsible lenders access to future capital (i.e., credit) is better than fewer honest banks.  Hand-wavy, I know. But potentially true.  Lastly, crypto companies needing banks to “skirt the banking system” highlights exactly why the banking system needs to be skirted (or at least somehow broken up). Imagine for a moment there is an institution in a country that is so critically important that the simple threat of regulation against that institution for servicing a client in an undesirable industry brings that undesirable industry to its knees. But no need for imagination: This is exactly what is happening in the United States. We now see an implicit promise of future regulation from the executive and legislative branch of the U.S. government if the banks that service crypto companies don’t shape up. Whatever that means.  While I don’t think this is a good thing, it can be if not overdone. If there is a higher bar for banking access for crypto companies that leads to more thorough diligence that somehow results in fewer bad companies in the ecosystem, ultimately retail will be safer and the system less sensitive to future crypto shocks.  Maybe that is what happens. For now, I choose cautious optimism.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,George Kaloudis,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/03/06/cryptos-banking-problem-is-not-ironic,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fe99a15b25f8ecb5d7298ad90973977188379414-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to the SEC’s complaint, Green United and two individuals – the company’s founder, 46-year-old Utah resident Wright Thurston, and its main promoter, 43-year-old Utah resident Kristoffer Krohn – offered investments in $3,000 “Green Boxes,” specialized crypto mining machines that purported to mine GREEN tokens on the Green Blockchain.  Investors were allegedly told that the GREEN tokens mined supported a “public global decentralized power grid” – all while generating a handsome 40% to 50% monthly return.  Investors were also allegedly told the success of their investments depended on Green United maintaining control of their “Green Boxes,” which would be remotely hosted at a Green United-controlled data center. GREEN tokens generated by their machines would be distributed to investors.  However, according to the SEC, Green United’s mining machines never mined GREEN, because GREEN was not a mineable crypto asset and the so-called Green Blockchain didn’t exist. Instead, Thurston allegedly created GREEN tokens himself on the Ethereum blockchain and distributed them to investors’ wallets “several months” after he and Krohn started selling the machines to investors in April 2018.  In addition, contrary to Krohn’s representations to Green United’s investors, the SEC alleges that GREEN tokens never increased in value. They were not tradable on a secondary marketplace until the fall of 2020 – and the current price of $.004 is far below the promised initial value of 2 cents per token.  Green United’s real scheme, according to the SEC, was to dupe investors into buying S9 Antminers – bitcoin mining equipment – dressed up as “Green Boxes.” The investors’ purchases were functional, and “mined [bi]tcoin, which the investors did not receive.”  The SEC is seeking permanent injunctions against Green United, Thurston and Krohn, as well as disgorgement and civil penalties.  The suit is not Krohn’s first brush with the SEC. In 2012, the SEC obtained injunctive relief against the promoter for violating federal securities laws “due to misrepresentations he made in connection with a real estate investment program.”  Read more: SEC Files Emergency Action Against BKCoin for Running $100M ‘Ponzi-Like’ Scheme",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | REGULATION,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/03/06/sec-accuses-utah-based-green-united-of-running-18m-crypto-mining-scam,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/38e061c17a9cbd16049502c12c0189c74998b2c5-4800x2700.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411199,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glLsaD,1678137115,Bitcoin Mining Is Good for the Energy Grid and Good for the Environment,"This week, the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works (EPW) will hold a hearing on digital assets and the environment. This hearing will almost exclusively focus on the energy use from Bitcoin’s proof-of-work mining process.  At its simplest, Bitcoin data centers (also known as miners) use computers to secure the Bitcoin network and process transactions. For this work they are rewarded in bitcoin (BTC). Critics have highlighted the large amount of energy use of bitcoin miners and argued that governments should either clamp down on bitcoin mining or force miners to switch away from the proof-of-work protocol and operate in a less energy-intensive fashion.  Dennis Porter is the CEO of Satoshi Action Fund.  This critique lacks important context, such as the fact that more energy is lost in transmission and distribution of electricity than the entire Bitcoin network uses annually. Having governments clamp down on Bitcoin’s energy usage or attempting to switch how transactions are processed would not only undermine the Bitcoin network but also impede energy innovation, positive environmental outcomes and economic opportunity in America.  Bitcoin can drive renewable energy innovation  Bitcoin has the potential to expand renewable energy generation. Renewable energy currently struggles with reliability, cost and use of electricity throughout American power grids. Bitcoin mining provides a solution to each of these issues.  Solar and wind energy are intermittent because they only produce energy when the sun is shining and the wind is blowing. Much of this energy is generated when demand is low, and if this energy is not stored in batteries it is simply wasted or “curtailed.” Currently, the state of California is on track to curtail 5 million megawatt hours by 2030. This is more energy than the bottom 36 nations use combined. Bitcoin miners stand ready to purchase excess energy from wind and solar farms, improving the revenue for renewable generation and preventing taxpayers from subsidizing the generation of energy. A win-win.  Miners can also smooth out the intermittent generation of renewables by participating in grid-balancing services. Miners not only will consume excess generation from wind and solar generation, but also then reduce their energy consumption neary to zero when ratepayers and other key sectors, like hospitals and businesses, need power. Miners regularly reduce their consumption in states that allow this kind of grid participation, ensuring grid operators have the ability to keep the lights on and power prices low.  Miners aren’t just good for renewables. They can also make use of stranded methane, a potent greenhouse gas, that is often uneconomical to bring to market. Methane is frequently vented or flared from landfills, abandoned wells, and oil and gas operations.  Because bitcoin miners can operate anywhere, they can turn stranded methane gas into electricity and use it to mine bitcoin, generating both a monetary and environmental benefit. Former Greenpeace activist and researcher Daniel Batten has stated that it would take “around 50 mid-large sized landfills in the U.S. fully combusting their methane … to make the entire Bitcoin network carbon negative” – a feat which is nearly impossible for any other industry to accomplish unless they do so through the purchase of carbon credits.  These use cases highlight just a few ways bitcoin mining can reduce overall emissions while encouraging the buildout of America’s energy resources. Bitcoin mining should be viewed as an effective tool for a lower emissions future, not a contributing problem.  The perils of proof-of-stake  Despite these benefits, many have pressured those in the Bitcoin industry to move to another way to create new blocks of transactions, specifically a mechanism known as proof-of-stake. Rather than using specialized computers, proof-of-stake relies on users locking up their cryptocurrency for a period of time in a process known as “staking.” This allows users to generate a passive income while contributing to processing transactions and securing the network. While this process does use less energy, it comes with other complications.  Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler recently sat down for an interview where he argued that every cryptocurrency, other than bitcoin, was a security and therefore under the jurisdiction of the SEC. The interview came just days after the SEC filed an enforcement action against the cryptocurrency exchange Kraken for letting its U.S. customers use their Ethereum tokens – ether (ETH) – to participate in “staking” to validate the Ethereum network. This enforcement action included a hefty fine and a cease-and-desist order.  On top of these actions, Gensler has commented separately that any cryptocurrency using proof-of-stake could be a security and therefore fall under the SEC’s regulatory jurisdiction. By maintaining its current proof-of-work structure, those in the Bitcoin space can avoid such complications.  The Bitcoin community should continue on its current path and look to empower renewable energy, mitigate methane emissions and utilize stranded energy to improve both the network and America’s power generation. EPW’s core mission is balancing fundamental American needs such as energy reliability alongside environmental stewardship. Bitcoin can help America achieve this.  With this in mind, we should be embracing bitcoin mining and fostering its growth across the nation to ensure the U.S. leads the globe in the next wave of energy and environmental innovation.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | MINING | REGULATION,Dennis Porter,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/03/06/bitcoin-mining-is-good-for-the-energy-grid-and-good-for-the-environment,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f6d9ac15d4bf1f75fcda356deaafc3151a702e04-3945x2218.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Trading volume for both fell below their respective, 20-day moving averages, reflecting a market that is showing little conviction in any direction.  BTC and ETH are both trading less than 1% above their respective 50-day moving averages, and have yet to dent the 4% and 5% declines of the prior week.  Negative sentiment continues to overhang markets following the unraveling of crypto-focused bank Silvergate’s asset base. The specter of contagion landing on counterparties (i.e., Coinbase, Paxos and Galaxy Digital) has markets understandably concerned.  Still, given Monday’s relatively flat trading, investors seem to simply be re-pricing risk within crypto assets, rather than abandoning markets. If investors were departing, the decline following the Silvergate development would be more pronounced on significantly greater volume.  A look at BTC and ETH’s daily chart shows the opposite, with little price movement and diminished activity.  An important gauge in the coming week will be BTC and ETH’s 20-day moving average, and the extent to which both assets recapture (or don’t) that level.  Following Friday’s decline, bitcoin traded above its 20-day moving average for 16 consecutive days. ETH accomplished this in 15 out of the prior 16 days. A recapture of the 20-day moving average would suggest that investors have adjusted to, and moved on from the Silvergate news. A decline would suggest the opposite.  Markets may be quieter than usual ahead of U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s testimony this week before the U.S. Senate Banking and House Financial Services committees.  Observers of U.S. monetary policy widely expect Powell to reiterate the bank’s commitment to lower inflation through hawkish interest rate hikes, citing concerns about an overheated jobs market that has put pressure on organizations to raise wages.

USDT’s market share among stablecoins surpassed 54% on Monday, data from CoinGecko shows. This is the largest market share Tether’s stablecoin has reached since late November 2021, after the crypto bull market reached its apex.  Tether’s gain came mostly at the expense of rival Binance USD, which has been in rapid decline since its issuer, Paxos, announced on Feb. 13 that it would halt minting new BUSD tokens due to pressure from the New York Department of Financial Services, the state’s top regulator. Since then, BUSD has shrunk below $9 billion from a $16 billion market capitalization.  USDT’s market capitalization has grown some $5.3 billion this year so far to $71.6 billion, with $3 billion of the gains after mid-February. Circle’s rival stablecoin, USD coin (USDC), has also gained $3 billion since the Paxos announcement; however, its $44 billion market cap is still lower than at the start of 2023.  Stablecoins have become the backbone of the crypto economy in recent years, ballooning to a peak market capitalization of$188 billion in May 2022.

42412742,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl5wu2,1678133437,U.S. Banking Watchdog: You Can’t Trust Crypto Firms Until They Get Federal Oversight,"It may be difficult to trust a crypto company that isn't federally supervised, a key bank regulator said Monday.  As it stands, there’s no way for people to know which crypto firms they can rely on, said Michael Hsu, the acting head of the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC).  “We won't be able to know which players are trustworthy and which aren't until a credible third party, like a consolidated home country supervisor, can meaningfully oversee them,” Hsu said in remarks prepared for delivery at an Institute of International Bankers event in Washington, D.C. “Currently, no crypto platforms are subject to consolidated supervision. Not one.”  Hsu said the FTX mayhem last year reminded him of former international bank, Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) – a cautionary tale in supervision of a “complex web” of cross-border activity with no single regulator in charge of the big picture. The bank's 1991 implosion offers “striking similarities” to FTX, Hsu said, and a lesson for governments to insist that a single regulatory entity can see a whole institution.  He noted that international standard-setting organizations, such as the Financial Stability Board, are working on comprehensive global frameworks for supervising the sector.  “Trust is a fragile thing,” Hsu said. “We have learned this the hard way in banking. I believe it contains useful lessons for crypto.”  Read more: White House Is 'Aware of' Silvergate Situation, Spokeswoman Says",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/03/06/us-banking-watchdog-you-cant-trust-crypto-firms-until-they-get-federal-oversight,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4fa65ef0e9c34a692a100851abbcbd70a5cf3f74-3412x1919.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The SEC's complaint accused Kang and his Miami-based fund of using a portion of the ~$100M it raised from at least 55 investors (from October 2018 through September 2022) to make ""Ponzi-like payments and for personal use."" BKCoin and Kang promised investors that their money would be used mostly to trade crypto through separately managed accounts, said the SEC, which was granted emergency relief by the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. Instead, BKCoin and Kang commingled investor funds and used over $3.6M to make payments to other investors. In addition, the SEC alleged that Kang misappropriated at least $371K in investor funds for his personal use. He ""attempted to conceal the unauthorized use of investor money by providing altered documents with inflated bank account balances to the third-party administrator for certain of the funds."" BKCoin apparently also misrepresented to some investors that one of its funds had been audited by a ""top four auditor,"" when in fact it never received an audit, the SEC said. The complaint is seeking permanent injunctions against both BKCoin and Kang, in addition to disgorgement, prejudgement interest, and a civil penalty.

The suit was filed in the Court of Chancery in Delaware. It also asserts claims against Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein and Grayscale owner Digital Currency Group (DCG) and its CEO, Barry Silbert.  DCG is also the owner of Coindesk.  According to Alameda’s complaint, Grayscale has extracted exorbitant management fees for its management of the Grayscale Bitcoin and Ethereum trusts, and has allowed those trusts’ shares to trade at roughly a 50% discount to their net asset value.  The complaint asserts that if Grayscale reduced its fees and allowed redemptions, FTX Debtors shares would be worth at least $550 million, or roughly 90% more than their current value.  ""We will continue to use every tool we can to maximize recoveries for FTX customers and creditors,” said John J. Ray III, CEO and chief restructuring officer of the FTX Debtors, in a statement. “Our goal is to unlock value that we believe is currently being suppressed by Grayscale's self-dealing and improper redemption ban.”  In an email to CoinDesk, a spokesperson for Grayscale called the lawsuit ""misguided,"" adding that ""Grayscale has been transparent in our efforts to obtain regulatory approval to convert GBTC into an [exchanged-traded fund] – an outcome that is undoubtedly the best long-term product structure for Grayscale’s investors.""

42387962,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQzcNj,1678126219,GBTC Discount Narrows to 42% Ahead of Grayscale’s ETF Hearing Tuesday,"The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) discount to net asset value has fallen to its lowest level in a month ahead of oral arguments in federal court on Tuesday related to Grayscale's lawsuit against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  Grayscale is appealing the SEC’s decision to deny the conversion of the trust into an exchange-traded fund. The company said it’s preparing to argue that the SEC inappropriately treated its ETF bid differently than its earlier decisions to approve bitcoin futures-based ETFs, according to the Grayscale legal team.  Known in crypto markets as the ""Grayscale discount,"" this key metric has narrowed to 42% at press time after hitting levels of 47% in mid-February. According to data from TradeBlock, this is the trimmest discount since Feb. 7.  GBTC has been trading at a mostly steadily widening discount to NAV for nearly two years, but some investors are hopeful that the discount will continue its recent narrowing should the courts be receptive to Grayscale's ETF arguments.  “There are many investors waiting for the green light from the SEC to convert GBTC into an ETF because it will narrow the current gap,” GenTwo analyst Pablo Jodar told CoinDesk.  Jodar added that he is seeing some investors buying GBTC ahead of the hearing on Tuesday. “There are investors buying GBTC now to play the positive scenario from the lawsuit,” Jodar said, noting that it's the equivalent of buying bitcoin (BTC) at a discount to its current price. “However, it is a risky bet for sure,” he added.  Laurent Kssis, a crypto trading adviser at CEC Capital, said that with GBTC trading at such a discount, it makes sense to hold some of the shares, although traders must be brave if bitcoin’s price continues to slide. Kssis said that he isn't hearing of investors buying more GBTC shares on Monday ahead of Tuesday's hearing, but he is seeing most investors hedging against a possible drop in bitcoin’s price.  “There is room for more unwelcome news that could push bitcoin further down,” said Kssis.  “This could be a good opportunity to capitalize on any potential discount convergence to net asset value ahead of the final decision,” said Sean Farrell, vice president of digital-asset strategy at Fundstrat.  “We are seeing the market put this into practice already as GBTC is up approximately 3% against BTC this morning,” Farrell said. “While far from a certainty, it is our view that the market is underpricing the likelihood of a Grayscale victory.”",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/03/06/gbtc-discount-narrows-to-42-ahead-of-grayscales-etf-hearing-tuesday,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/203ae0960c1c58db25f13b6865f6096bd34fed10-1374x773.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Rather, he attributed recent price levels to macroeconomic factors.  “We don’t see too much of a material impact on the price [of bitcoin] from Silvergate,” Rashwan told CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” on Monday. “I would obviously concede that it’s one of several factors that’s driving the price right now.”  Last week, California-based Silvergate said it would be suspending its 24/7 crypto exchange service, citing contagion concerns from the implosion of FTX and further regulatory scrutiny. The platform, which allowed its client to make transactions at any time, was used by major crypto players, including Kraken, Gemini and Binance.US.  Silvergate’s story has yet to be defined, Rashwan said, but bitcoin's price performance is now being influenced by macroeconomic factors, including inflation, which he said “is still both rampant and here.”  Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is set to testify before a Senate committee Tuesday. Whether the Fed will increase interest rates again is likely, according to Rashwan. But pinpointing the connection between inflation and an asset like bitcoin “remains to be seen.”  “I don’t think we’re out of the woods yet,” he said. “We will continue to see these [interest] rate rises,” he added, but whether the market has priced that in “it's really difficult to show right now.”  Additional macro factors, including China’s loosening of its COVID-19 restrictions, could also drive a rally in the digital asset moving forward, Rashwan said, adding that “it’s definitely helpful.”  “A lot of East Asian traffic was subdued for quite some time due to a number of factors, both economic and political,” Rashwan added.  Nonetheless, China’s “opening up is clearly bullish, and sending a lot of buy signals,” he said.

42411193,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glLsGN,1678125419,Nigerians’ Rejection of Their CBDC Is a Cautionary Tale for Other Countries,"In Nigeria, citizens have taken to the streets to protest the nation’s cash shortage, further objecting to their government’s implementation of a central bank digital currency (CBDC). The shortage came about due to cash restrictions aimed at pushing the country into a 100% cashless economy. Yet, instead of adopting the CBDC, Nigerian protesters are demanding paper money be restored.  The country’s experience strongly suggests the average citizen understands that CBDCs present a substantial risk to financial freedom while providing no unique benefit.  Nicholas Anthony is a policy analyst in the Cato Institute’s Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives.  It is no secret that CBDCs have been growing in popularity among central bankers, policy makers, and consultancy firms in recent years. Yet, for citizens it’s been another story. When the U.S. Federal Reserve solicited comments on CBDCs, more than two-thirds of the commenters were concerned about the risks to financial privacy, financial freedom and the stability of the banking system.  Further, CBDCs really don’t add anything novel to the market in terms of benefits for consumers. To the extent people want it, many currencies are available in digital forms through debit cards, payment apps and even prepaid cards. That much should be clear from the abysmal adoption rate in Nigeria, where less than 0.5 % of Nigerians have used the CBDC. To put that number into perspective, more than 50% of Nigerians have used cryptocurrency.  CBDC adoption incentives in Nigeria have failed  The Nigerian government has unleashed a flurry of tricks to spur adoption but none has proven effective. To its credit, the Nigerian government initially tried to encourage use through modest measures. In August 2022, it removed access restrictions so that bank accounts were no longer required to use the CBDC. Then, in October, it offered discounts if people used the CBDC to pay for cabs.  Yet, neither effort proved to be fruitful. Put simply, Nigerians prefer cash.  Read more: Why Nigerians Aren't Turning to the eNaira Despite Crippling Cash Shortages  Unfortunately, the Nigerian government doubled down and moved to more drastic measures by restricting cash itself. In December the Central Bank of Nigeria began restricting cash withdrawals to 100,000 naira (US$225) per week for individuals and 500,000 naira ($1,123) for businesses.  To make matters worse, the Nigerian government also chose to redesign the currency during this time in a “move aimed at restoring the control of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) over currency in circulation” and to “further deepen the push to [a] cashless economy,” according to a CBN press release.  So not only are citizens limited in how much they may withdraw, but the commercial banks also don’t have the cash to give out because many are still waiting for the newly designed cash to arrive.  With these restrictions in place, the Nigerian government managed to drain the economy of cash and set the stage for the CBDC to finally have its moment in the spotlight.  ‘You can’t legislate a change in behavior’  And yet, it didn’t work. Stories of Nigerians struggling with the cash restrictions quickly spread across Twitter posts, TikTok videos and other social media. Rather than turn to the CBDC, Nigerians took to the streets to protest the restrictions and cash shortage.  The new notes will, it is hoped, arrive soon, but even then Nigerians are unlikely to find relief. Central bank Governor Godwin Emefiele said, “The destination, as far as I am concerned, is to achieve a 100% cashless economy in Nigeria.”  The company that designed the Nigerian CBDC called the cash restrictions a creative use of marketing and said other countries could be expected to take similar steps. Yet, Nigeria should serve as a cautionary tale for other countries looking to launch CBDCs.  Ayokunle Olumbunmi, head of financial institutions ratings at Agusto and Co. in Nigeria, put it well when he said that the central bank “doesn’t want us to be spending cash. They want us to be doing transactions electronically, but you can’t legislate a change in behavior.”  CBDCs may be popular among central bankers, but money is ultimately a tool for the people. So long as the risks outweigh the benefits, it's unlikely any CBDC will gain traction in Africa or elsewhere.",NEGATIVE,없음,FIAT | MARKET | SPONSORED,Nicholas Anthony,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/03/06/nigerians-rejection-of-their-cbdc-is-a-cautionary-tale-for-other-countries,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1332decfd25d15812aefce1de5f184ca9b10383c-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to regulators, BKCoin and Kang raised $100 million from over 50 investors, and used a portion of investor funds to make “Ponzi-like payments” and for personal use.  BKCoin and Kang promised investors their money would be used to trade crypto, and that funds would be held in separately managed accounts, said the SEC. However, Kang and BKCoin allegedly commingled client money and used at least $3.6 million to make payments to other investors.  The SEC’s action comes five months after BKCoin’s core legal entity, BKCoin Management LLC, filed suit in a Florida circuit court alleging that Kang had “improperly diverted'' $12 million in cash and other assets out of BKCoin’s multi-strategy funds.

In its arguments, the Trustee said an independent examiner could look into whether those responsible for mismanagement at FTX are still part of the company.  A bipartisan group of U.S. senators had also called for an independent probe.  On Feb. 15, however, the Delaware-based U.S. bankruptcy court's Judge John Dorsey – who is overseeing the winding down of FTX – agreed with the company’s new management that an independent examination would represent costly delay to any resolution of the case.

The platform, jumper.exchange, traverses a bevy of trading venues as well as bridging to find the cheapest and fastest path to swap tokens and blockchains. It works across much of the Ethereum Virtual Machine ecosystem and plans to go further, CEO Philipp Zentner said in an interview.  While there are already plenty of bridge aggregators and DEX aggregators out there, Zentner said that “the user journey is just not good.” LI.FI’s combined platform is a noncustodial setup that doesn’t introduce more risk into the equation and in fact vets bridges and decentralized exchanges to make sure they’re safe to use, according to Zentner.  “We take off that huge research overhead you have as a user to navigate across the 70 bridges that are out there – so many bridging projects and new ones coming up,” Zentner said. “And they all have different security models, trust assumptions, attack vectors. It's just hard to really go deep enough in the details to understand them and to make your own decision.”  Zentner said LI.FI does not charge a fee for retail users. “We are first and foremost a B2B company,” he said, explaining LI.FI provides APIs to other companies. The new retail-facing bridge and swap aggregator is free, he said. An API allows a third party to use a standard programming call to access data on a given platform.  “We tried to get this week to $100 million in volume,” Zentner said here during the ETHDenver conference.

42387970,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQzcz9,1678120831,ETHDenver 2023 Ran a Profit. Will Members of Its DAO Get Some of the Returns?,"DENVER — The organizers of this year’s ETHDenver have a good problem to tackle now that the world’s biggest Ethereum conference has wrapped: What to do with its first modest profit.  For the first time in its history, SporkDAO LCA (Limited Cooperative Association), the Colorado collective that owns ETHDenver LLC and a handful of other Ethereum-focused entities, made enough surplus cash from its flagship conference that it might even return some of the money to members of the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).  In an interview, Conference Chief John Paller told CoinDesk the “back of the napkin math” indicated ETHDenver 2023 is around to $500,000 to $1 million in the black. That’s no small feat given this year’s edition was the largest, most expensive production in ETHDenver’s six-year history and one that happened during the throes of a bear market.  The surprising surplus means that SporkDAO’s members – conference attendees, sponsors, speakers and volunteers who opted into joining this “decentralized autonomous organization” and receiving its $SPORK tokens when they secured their tickets – could receive a slice if SporkDAO’s nine-person board decides to do a “distribution,” Paller said.  In the past, ETHDenver “was profitable, but only to the extent that we had enough runway to get to the next event,” Paller said. The organization’s board now has the right governance in place to manage the money, either paying it out to $SPORK-holding members or reinvesting it into future conferences, he said.  Crypto conferences are multimillion-dollar affairs that pump revenue and name recognition into the dozens of organizations that stage them annually. Nearly all of them are managed by centralized entities: crypto “protocols,” media companies, investment firms and others. ETHDenver, which this year attracted 20,000 people, is the only one of its size owned by a DAO.  After losing $700,000 in last year’s far smaller edition, ETHDenver’s unpaid nine-person board retooled their planning for this event, board member Dani Osorio said. That included hiring a chief operating officer and “skeleton staff” who could manage planning and raise sponsorship dollars year round. It worked.  Getting cash from top sponsors is critical for staging an event that’s free for the vast majority of attendees. As long as you’re a member of SporkDAO (you opt into membership when claiming a ticket and have to renew once a year), your attendance is on the house. You can attend ETHDenver without being a member, but you have to pay $599, Paller said. Some companies took this option rather than having to think about what it would mean to join a DAO.  DAO or something else?  SporkDAO LCA isn’t technically a DAO, though there’s not really a set-in-stone rule defining what is and isn’t this anti-centralization form of distributed governance. Still, the ethos of a DAO is a community-owned and governed organization, and for now Paller said Colorado’s cooperative laws provide the closest legal fit for SporkDAO to “eat its own dog food” as it moves more and more power to the community.  “We call it a digital co-op,” Paller said. “We do call it an ‘event DAO’ if we want to pander to the Web3 folks just so they understand. Because Web3 people like it. They like ‘DAO,’ but nobody else gets it. You have to kind of be able” to speak to both.  DAO or not, the organization does have a crypto token that could be poised to accrue value for its owners who belong to SporkDAO. SPORK is an incentives token that provides potential exposure to the rewards of all SporkDAO endeavors, including the conference and also bets made by the collective’s early-stage startup incubator, Bufficorn Ventures.  Wholly owned by SporkDAO LCA, Bufficorn Ventures writes small checks to “really, really early” crypto companies to help them get going, Paller said. Bufficorn has easy access to this pre-seed landscape given its proximity to ETHDenver’s builder community, hackathons and speakers, some of which have become rocketing successes after attending the conference. The future returns of Bufficorn Ventures’ investments could also be distributed to patrons, Paller said.  “Obviously, not all of them are going to be successful,” Paller said of the startups into which Bufficorn plans to invest. “But when they're successful, the people holding SPORK tokens become benefactors of that. So if I'm a sponsor who put 30 grand [into ETHDenver] and I get a bunch of SPORK tokens back for that patronage – now I kind of look at it as an investment.”  Read more: ETHDenver Teases Spin-off Plans as Conference Winds Down",POSITIVE,ETH,BUSINESS | ETH | REGULATION | TRADING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/03/06/ethdenver-2023-ran-a-profit-will-members-of-its-dao-get-some-of-the-returns,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7873b8ee6459616bae07eacf033f85fd16b08d60-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The scheme first appeared in Egypt in August, promising investors large profits from crypto mining and trading.  Crypt trading in 2018 was declared forbidden in Egypt under Islamic law. While that religious decree was not legally binding, a de facto ban has been in place thanks to prohibitive banking laws introduced in 2020.  However, crypto interest remains high in the country, which has been experiencing severe economic woes in recent years, with the Egyptian pound having depreciated nearly 50% against the dollar since March 2022.

It is growing at a fast click and also increasing profitability. Now could be the right time to invest in emerging markets, especially Brazil. Company Overview Nubank ( NU ) is a recently IPO'd company operating in Brazil and a few other South American companies. This ""neobank"" jumped into the scene by offering consumer credit cards. While this may hardly seem like an innovation, we have to understand that a large population of Brazil has been underserved in this sector. Wealth inequalities are large in South American countries, and a large part of the population, traditionally, did not have access to financing options like credit cards. The bank makes most of its income from interest charged on its credit cards but has expanded its offerings into other banking segments, such as regular loans and insurance. There's a lot to like about NU since it is growing at a fast rate and increasing its profitability. On top of that though, I am particularly fond of the bank's crypto-friendliness and the fact that Warren Buffett owns this stock. Nubank has its own cryptocurrency in the works, Nucoin. It is currently being beta tested but will serve in the future as means to extend discounts and other offerings to its customers. While I don't think this is anything revolutionary or game-changing, Nubank is making the right moves in a market that could really benefit from a more modern, democratic, and accessible form of banking. Recent Results The company has just released its fourth-quarter results for the year, delivering a revenue beat and showing very promising trends in customer growth, revenue, and profitability. Revenue, costs and profits (Investor slides) Nubank posted a 112% YoY revenue growth on an FX-neutral basis and a 137% increase in net profit. The company actually posted a Net Income of $58 million, though this includes the adjusting for a ""one-time non-cash recognition of the 2021 CSA termination in the amount of $355.6 million."" NU Financial Summary (Investor slides) Not only did Nubank increase its number of customers, but it also managed to increase the activity rate of its customers, and deposit growth even outpaced customer growth. The increased activity is reflected in how Nu has been able to successfully cross-sell its products, increasing Average Revenue Per Active User in the process. NU ARPA (Investor slides) We can see that Nu customers are using other products with time and that monthly ARPAC is growing. It's also worth mentioning that Monthly Average Cost to Serve Per Active Customer remained flat at $0.9 on a YoY basis. NU operating leverage (Investor slides) And not only that, but the company has also substantially increased its Net Interest Income Margin, which speaks volumes of just how profitable Nubank could become. Outlook and Valuation Nubank is in a great position right now. It has found itself a spot in the market and is using that to expand its offerings to the rest of Latin America. Let's not forget that Brazil has a population of $214 million, and Nubank is expanding into Mexico and Colombia, finding similar success so far in those markets. Banking-as-a-service in LatAM is expected to deliver a 20.2% CAGR from 2023-2027, so Nu has plenty of growth to top into. Current EPS estimates show that the company should begin turning a profit in 2023. NU EPS ((SA)) Estimates also show that revenue growth over the next three years should average almost 30%. NU revenues ((SA)) Nu currently trades at a P/S ratio of 12, but the forward price ratio seems a lot more reasonable. Using these revenue estimates, assuming that by 2024 Nu can command a P/S of 6, the price target would be $10.14 by December 2024. I believe this would be a fair multiple since it is reasonable to believe that the multiple should contract but still reflect the fast growth of revenues. Technical Analysis If we look at a possible Elliott Wave path for Nu, a $10 price tag also seems quite achievable in the coming years. NU TA (Author's work) This type of analysis is harder to do on companies with a short price history. However, if NU manages to hold the lows it made at $3,40 then we could argue that the stock has put in an I-II structure, which could be the beginning of an impulse that could take us north of $11 in the large degree wave III. For now, I think we could see a significant retracement in wave 2, so I will set some buy orders around the $4,5 area, just above the 50% retracement of the recent rally. Risks and Other Considerations Now, we can't finish this article without addressing the elephant in the room. Nu operates mostly in Brazil, a country which has been troubled by political instability and inflation. If Nu was an American company, buying it would be a no-brainer, but it is not. Having said this, there is reason to believe that Brazil's economy could perform well in the coming years. Politically, the country has just undergone a tumultuous transition of power, but the worst is behind us. Lula is now president, and though some investors could view this as bad news for the market, the Brazilian Central Bank has come out vigorously in defense of its fight against inflation, despite this going against Lula's intentions. In what could be described as a bold move, the president of the Central Bank gave a long interview on TV to address the public's concerns. In a rare two-hour television appearance, Campos Neto, 53, took a battery of tough questions from six reporters and walked a diplomatic tightrope. He expressed a desire for good relations with Lula's economic team while refusing to cave on two of its central demands: to cut interest rates and raise the inflation target. Based on the positive market reaction the following morning, his gamble paid off. Source: bnnbloomberg.ca The Brazilian real has stood strong against the dollar, and with Brazil's interest rate at 13.75%, inflation should continue to cool off. Overall, I believe the dollar will weaken in the coming months, following a strong rally in 2022. This should help emerging markets, which seems to already be a consensus trade in 2023 , with investors pouring $1 billion into them. Takeaway In conclusion, Nu is showing promising results and taking the right approach in a key market in Latin America. Nubank is bringing banking to the people, and it is not afraid to make use of new technologies, like blockchain and crypto in the process. Brazil is a risky bet, but one that could pay off well.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | ICO | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4584867-nu-holdings-im-buying-buffett-fintech-play?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/10340642.jpeg

The company expects to have about another 8,000 rigs energized in coming weeks, bringing capacity at the Pennsylvania-based Nautilus facility to 1.9 EH/s by May, according to a Monday press release.  Nautilus will significantly lower TeraWulf's energy costs, with the company having secured a power agreement for 2 cents per kilowatt hour (kWh) of power for five years, which will bring its average energy cost down to about 4 cents/kWh across its two facilities. That's much lower than the U.S. industrial average of 9 cents/kWh that the Energy Information Administration reported in December 2022, as well as the variable rate TeraWulf pays at its New York site, which averages 5 cents/kWh.  Along with its mining peers, TeraWulf has struggled mightily during the crypto winter as declining bitcoin prices teamed with rising energy costs. The Maryland-based company had to embark on a series of cost-cutting initatives in November and raised $10 million in new capital in December to repay some of its debt. However, both crypto and energy markets have improved somewhat in early 2023, and the mining industry is showing early signs of recovery.  The Nautilus mine is ""the first behind-the-meter bitcoin mining facility of its kind, directly sourcing reliable, carbon free, and 24x7 baseload power from the 2.5GW Susquehanna nuclear generation station in Pennsylvania,"" according to TeraWulf.

Delays to the deal are costing the company $10 million per month, a filing Sunday with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of Voyager said. The firm expressed surprise at the delays and evolutions in the SEC’s position on the matter and urged a speedy resolution to its bankruptcy case. Voyager filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in July.  Voyager “disagree[s] with any assertion, by SEC staff or otherwise, that VGX is a security, and the debtors’ view is supported by a legal opinion from a nationally recognized law firm,” according to a statement by Mark Renzi, Voyager’s financial adviser.  Renzi cited CoinDesk reporting of remarks by the SEC’s William Uptegrove, who first on Thursday declined to take a position on VGX’s status and then on Friday told the court the SEC's staff believe Binance.US is running an illegal securities exchange because financial instruments should be registered with the regulator. The statement didn't reflect the views of the SEC commissioners, Uptegrove said.  “This supplemental statement from the SEC’s counsel was a surprise to the debtors,” Renzi said. He added Voyager had given the regulator information on VGX on the topic around one and half years ago and hence might reasonably have considered the matter closed.  “The debtors are burning more than $10 million a month” until the deal is completed, the filing said, and so a longer legal process means less funds to distribute to creditors. “The debtors cannot responsibly delay any further to accommodate the SEC’s apparent evolving deliberative process.”  Although bankruptcy court Judge Michael Wiles on Thursday said he was “absolutely shocked” by the vague nature of the SEC’s objection, Renzi has now proposed modifications to the exact wording of the deal, which he said were too minor to warrant another vote by creditors.  In December, Binance.US said it would acquire Voyager, but in response to SEC revelations at recent hearings, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao tweeted that he might “pull out.”  Shortly after that tweet, Zhao clarified in another tweet that he is “still in support of the deal and helping returning funds to users as quickly as possible, if allowed to do so.”  The court hearing to approve the deal enters its third day on Monday.",NEGATIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | REGULATION | BNB,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/03/06/voyager-denies-sec-claims-vgx-token-is-security-as-binance-us-decision-looms,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e72d57d6fb2b1781d60a59349bdac5c116085135-2047x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Although the government hasn't given a timeline for bringing in crypto legislation, last month it said it would release a consultation paper about the issue the middle of this year.  In a document dated last August, three months after Anthony Albanese defeated Scott Morrison's coalition to become Australia's prime minister, the Treasury revealed how some stakeholders might be disappointed with a ""perceived delay in implementing a licensing regime"" but viewed the concerns as ""somewhat mitigated"" by the collapse of several crypto companies and market crash earlier in the year.  The Australian Financial Review, which reported on the papers earlier, said the Treasury's timetable for consulting with industry and designing new legislation stretches well into next year.  ""Final submissions to cabinet are not expected until towards the end of this year,"" AFR said, leading some industry observers to suggest that ""legislation would probably not come until well into 2024 or 2025.""  Also last August, Treasurer Jim Chalmers said Australian ""regulation is struggling to keep pace and adapt with the crypto asset sector,"" and introduced token mapping as a potential way forward. ""The Albanese government is taking a more serious approach to work out what is in the ecosystem and what risks need to be looked at first.""  ""While recognizing the need for action, Treasury sees the opportunity to take more time to better understand the emerging innovations and risks,"" according to one of the documents, which also reveal that the Treasury has established a crypto policy unit.

Decentraland’s MANA token gained 5% Monday, going against the rest of the crypto market which traded down.  A U.S. Securities and Exchange official said that agency staff believe Binance.US is operating an unregistered securities exchange in the U.S. and that staff believe the sale of VGX tokens by Voyager Digital violated federal securities laws. Speaking at a bankruptcy hearing to determine if Voyager should be sold to Binance.US, William Uptegrove, an attorney for the SEC, said he was responding to Judge Michael Wiles of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for Southern District of New York who said at the outset of the hearing that the SEC had provided little guidance or specifics about its objection to the Voyager sale. Voyager, a crypto broker, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy last July.  Crypto exchange Bybit on Saturday announced it is suspending U.S. dollar (USD) deposits. ""We have temporarily suspended USD deposits via Wire Transfer (including SWIFT) due to service outages from our end-point processing partner until further notice,"" the exchange said, adding that withdrawals will be stopped from March 10. Users, however, can continue to deposit and withdraw crypto to and from wallet addresses and fund purchases through credit cards and other payment methods.

The lender froze withdrawals last June, citing ""unusual liquidity pressures"" following a market downturn that spawned out of the $60 billion collapse of the Terra network.  Babel has filed a moratorium extension that would prevent creditors from making claims for at least another six months, according to a press release. The filing, according to Bloomberg, alleges that co-founder Wang Li racked up $524 million in proprietary trading losses, with another $224 million being lost after lenders liquidated collateral that underpinned loans issued to Babel.  Yang Zhou, co-founder and sole director of Babel Finance, has teamed up with several former employees to build Hope - a DeFi platform that will feature a stablecoin of the same name.  According to a proposal, the hope stablecoin will be backed by bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), which will see it maintain its peg to $1 as traders can benefit from arbitrage opportunities when the value dips below or rises above the peg.  It draws comparison with the terra USD (UST) stablecoin that prompted the market collapse last year, because that token was also backed with crypto as opposed to fiat currencies and equivalents like USD coin (USDC) and tether (USDT).

The project, which was conducted with the help of the central banks of Israel, Norway and Sweden, used a so-called ""hub-and-spoke"" method to connect between the countries' different national CBDC systems. A retail CBDC is a digital currency issued by a central bank that can be used for payments by consumers.  In the hub-and-spoke process, a cross-border transaction is broken down into two domestic payments facilitated by a foreign-exchange provider active in both countries. That gives central banks almost complete control over their CBDCs, while allowing competitive quotes for the exchange rate to be submitted to the hub so that end users can benefit from the best rate.  ""This competitive setup mitigates the risk of insufficient liquidity in the desired currency pair, which can drive fees up and even delay the transaction,"" the BIS said. ""The project also demonstrated that the hub-and-spoke model can reduce settlement and counterparty risk by using coordinated payments in central bank money; and complete cross-border transactions within seconds.""  Many central banks are looking to issue a CBDC within 10 years. Nigeria, Bahamas, Eastern Caribbean and Jamaica have already issued one, and China is further ahead than most countries with its CBDC trials. The Group of 20 industrialized nations has made exploring cross-border payment systems a priority, and Project Icebreaker was a response to G-20's call to action, the report said. The BIS has conducted other successful CBDC cross-border experiments, such as Project Dunbar, which focused on wholesale use, or money transfers between banks. .  For the hub-and-spoke model to work, every CBDC system involved needs to operate 24/7 and have a hash time-locked contract, which is a form of smart contract, a program that automatically execute transactions when triggered.  “Implementing the Icebreaker model in the real world would require a range of technology, policy and legal considerations to be addressed,” the report said. “Policy considerations could include the governance arrangement, the viability of the business model, liquidity provision, privacy, AML/CFT ( anti-money laundering/ combating the financing of terrorism) compliance and monitoring, and payment initiation-related standards.”",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Camomile Shumba,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/03/06/bis-says-hub-and-spoke-cross-border-transfers-offer-benefits-for-retail-cbdc,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1af05c542b6db05791a734533f4f8f59a944424c-4240x2385.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42387977,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQzdVt,1678098893,Does Bitcoin's Weekly Death Cross Pattern Call for Caution?,"An ominous-sounding technical pattern has appeared on bitcoin's (BTC) weekly price chart for the first time on record. Analysts, however, are split on what it means for cryptocurrency.  Bitcoin's 50-week simple moving average has crossed under its 200-week SMA, confirming a ""death cross,"" a bearish indicator suggesting the short-term price pullback could become a more sustained downtrend.  Even though the moving average-based death cross represents what happened in the past, many consider it a forward-looking indicator.  ""The death cross formed on the weekly time frame makes for a cautious view of the near-term outlook and keeps the potential for a return to the $18,000-$16,300,"" Alex Kuptsikevich, a market analyst at FxPro, said in an email.  One could argue that the death cross has come at the right time for bears, considering the crisis at crypto-friendly Silvergate Bank and surging interest rate expectations across the advanced world.  Bitcoin fell nearly 5% last week as Silvergate said it was evaluating its ability to survive as a going concern. The leading cryptocurrency ran into offers around the 50-week SMA for the second straight week.  ""Technically, the 50-week moving average continues to act as a valid resistance from which the selling intensifies,"" Kuptsikevich said.  Some observers, however, don't see the death cross as a reliable indicator, because it is based on backward-looking moving averages and lags prices and has proved to be a contrary indicator in stock markets.  ""A death cross is a nonevent. A weekly death cross means the 50-week average dropped below the 200-week average. They are *lagging* indicators that definitionally occur after a rapid decline,"" Timothy Peterson, investment manager at Cane Island Alternative Investments, tweeted last month.  According to Peterson, the death cross has been unreliable as a standalone indicator in traditional markets.  ""For the S&P 500 going back nearly 100 years, there have been 9 such occurrences: 1938, 48, 58, 63 , 70, 74, 78, 2001, '08.,"" Peterson said. ""Within 50 days, the average gain was 22% and the average loss was -9%. Within 200 days, the average gain was 46% and the average loss was -11%. Those are great risk/return odds.""",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/03/06/does-bitcoins-weekly-chart-death-cross-call-for-caution,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6ae1c11fbaed1f2f590c540eec86e7d635c5e32e-3026x1514.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

PancakeSwap, like other DEXs, relies on smart contracts to allow users to swap cryptocurrencies without intermediaries, earning revenue on each swap and distributing a cut of that revenue to liquidity providers in the form of rewards.  V3 will be available only on BNB Smart Chain (BSC), which is known for its fast and low-cost transactions. PancakeSwap also is deployed on the Aptos and Ethereum networks.  The upgrade adds features such as improved liquidity provisioning, competitive trading fees, trading incentives and yield-farming tools.  Such products are expected to attract more capital, increase protocol revenue, and ultimately bolster PancakeSwap's value proposition among investors.  The DEX held over $2.4 billion in locked tokens as of Monday. It has processed $438 billion in trading volume since its April 2021 launch, making it among the most widely used decentralized-finance (DeFi) protocols. Its native cake (CAKE) tokens have a market capitalization of $670 million.  PancakeSwap burned $27 million on cake tokens in a planned event during European morning hours on Monday. Burns refers to the permanent deletion of tokens from the total supply, which may contribute to price increases if demand outstrips supply.

London-based BCB, which was the first crypto company to receive a payments license from U.K. regulator the Financial Conduct Authority, provides fiat-to-crypto rails for currencies, including sterling, euros, Swiss francs and yen in Europe, particularly to institutional players such as crypto exchanges Bitstamp, Gemini and Kraken and financial-services firm Galaxy Digital.  Banking has been a dicey issue for crypto companies, many of which see the reinvention of traditional finance as their ultimate goal. Recent collapses and scandals have prompted a scattergun response from regulators in the U.S., and what could be viewed as a kind of choke point operation on crypto banking, at least as far as Silvergate Capital (SI) is concerned.  BCB launched its instant settlement network, the BCB Liquidity Interchange Network Consortium, or BLINC, in mid-2020. That's a real-time settlement system that does for euros, British pounds and Swiss francs what SEN did in the U.S. until recently for big crypto clients transacting in dollars.  New York-based Signature Bank’s (SBNY) Signet, an equivalent to SEN, has to date been the next largest network for USD instant settlement and stands to fill some of the demand. That said, a BLINC dollar component has been in the works for about a year and is getting ready to launch, Landsberg-Sadie said.  “Obviously, I’m going to try and bring that forward as quickly as possible,” he said in reference to news that Silvergate’s network is no longer running. “I’d like to say it could be live by spring, so we’ll do whatever it takes to make sure those who are stranded by SEN get some sort of continuity given the huge overlap of BCB and Silvergate clients.”  Unlike SEN, BLINC is multicurrency and isn’t tied to a single credit institution, such as Silvergate or Signature Bank, Landsberg-Sadie said. It wasn't designed to take deposits, he added. Rather, it was built as a payment institution to provide on-ramps to banks in places like the U.K., Switzerland and Europe.  “It’s a decentralized model,” said Landsberg-Sadie. “What you have with Silvergate and Signature is a credit institution solution applied to what is primarily a payments problem. Silvergate’s troubles started when they allowed long-term bitcoin bets against short-term cash deposits, an impossible position to unwind in 2022’s crazy markets. BLINC funds are 1:1, unleveraged, un-rehypothecated, always precisely 1:1 with safeguarded funds.”",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/03/06/crypto-banking-firm-bcb-readies-us-dollar-payments-to-plug-silvergate-gap,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cf67e10afc331ce029da77525e078919498c0e62-968x544.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

""We have temporarily suspended USD deposits via Wire Transfer (including SWIFT) due to service outages from our end-point processing partner until further notice,"" the exchange said, adding that withdrawals will be stopped from March 10.  Users, however, can continue to deposit and withdraw crypto to and from wallet addresses and fund purchases through credit cards and other payment methods.  ""The payment gateway interruption is limited in scope and does not involve other fiat or cryptocurrencies and/or account funding channels. Users can still buy cryptocurrencies in USD using their debit and credit cards through other channels. We are closely urging our partners for alternative solutions and will keep our users and stakeholders posted as soon as there are further developments,"" Bybit's spokesperson told CoinDesk.  Bybit's move comes a month after Binance, the world's largest digital assets exchange by trading volume, halteddollartransfersand amid a crisis at Silvergate, a California-based lender famous for offering traditional banking services to crypto firms, including exchanges. Last week, Silvergate said it's evaluating ""its ability to continue as a going concern"" and delayed filing its annual report with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

42387973,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQzdDB,1678086679,EOS Blockchain Plans Second Innings Ahead of April’s EVM Launch,"A blockchain that raised $4 billion in its initial coin offering (ICO) with little to show in its early years is aiming for crypto glory once again – years after almost being written off by skeptics.  EOS, whose native eos (EOS) tokens once reached a market capitalization of $14 billion at a lifetime peak, is gearing up for a complete resurgence in network activity and growth with extensive support planned for application developers.  That is thanks to the efforts of EOS Network Foundation, whose CEO, Yves La Rose, is leading plans for a consensus mechanism upgrade, an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) system and an overall renewed growth strategy, per crypto research firm Messari.  The EVM mainnet is slated for April 14 release, with updates and improvements planned in the weeks and months to follow.  “Combining the performance of EOS with the familiarity of Ethereum, Solidity developers are in for a treat,” Rose tweeted last week. “At 800+ swaps per second, $EOS EVM will be BY FAR the fastest EVM, benchmarked 3x faster than Solana + BNB and 25x faster than Avax.”  EVMs refer to the environment in which all Ethereum accounts and smart contracts live, serving as a virtual computer utilized by developers for creating decentralized applications (dapps). When deployed on other blockchains, EVMs can allow developers to build dapps and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications similar to how they would on Ethereum.  EVMs are a large part of EOS’ future plans.  “Many of the developers who have left EOS have done so not because they want to, but because Ethereum, for all its deficiencies, is where the action is,” the foundation said in a January post.  “EVM compatibility is essential to the potential of EOS, not just technically but also from a business perspective. Ultimately, it is essential that we welcome more Solidity developers and users to EOS, and an EVM on EOS is an excellent bridge to do just that,” it added at the time.  A grants program will fund developers working on such applications, starting from $10,000 to over $50,000 based on criterias such as the size and scope of the initiative. Grants can be provided to builders of wholly new products, or to fund maintenance and upgrades of existing tools.

42387965,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQzcbl,1678064764,First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Is Stuck Between Silvergate and China,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin had a flat weekend as the market continued to digest Silvergate, and also readied what will likely be positive economic data from China this week.  Insights: Like any good punk or hip hop show, this year's Colorado event for coders will feature events that will ""scare away normies,"" CoinDesk Chief Insights Columnist David Z. Morris writes.  Prices  Silvergate Woes and Likely China Improvement  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 1,044 +2.1 ▲ 0.2% Bitcoin (BTC) $22,463 +131.6 ▲ 0.6% Ethereum (ETH) $1,569 +2.3 ▲ 0.1% S&P 500  4,045.64 +64.3 ▲ 1.6% Gold  $1,859 +11.7 ▲ 0.6% Nikkei 225  27,927.47 +428.6 ▲ 1.6% BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices, as of 7 a.m. ET (11 a.m. UTC)  Good morning Asia, here’s what’s driving markets today.  Both bitcoin and ether are starting the week off flat, with the world’s largest digital asset at $22,463, up 0.6% on the day, and ether at $1,569, up 0.1%.  Observers say the market is at something of a precipice right now. While it’s no longer the depths of crypto winter, the market has to decide how much it will continue to price in Silvergate’s crypto failure while also accounting for positive economic data from China.  “It doesn't look like the Silvergate issue is leading to broad contagion. And we may have seen most of the drop associated with that news already,” Matt Weller, Forex.com’s global head of research, told CoinDesk TV on Friday. “I wouldn't be surprised to see bitcoin retrace back down to $20,000, maybe even $18,000, to sort of retest those lows. But … it does look like the depths of the winter are behind us.”  At the same time, economic data from a re-opened China, which rapidly dropped all COVID-19 restrictions at the start of the year, might bolster the “China narrative” that fueled late February’s mini price rally. This coming week is set to be a busy one with economic data releases from the country, including Balance of Trade, foreign exchange reserves and inflation-rate data expected.  “China’s opening is a positive factor for the world’s economy, which infers that certain animal spirits are back in Asia,” said March Zheng, the co-founder and managing partner of Bizantine Capital, in a note to CoinDesk.  These so-called animal spirits, Zheng said, could lead to an increase in appetite for assets like crypto.  “We are of the view that it will counterbalance the continued, persistent fears in the U.S. equity markets as well as rising rates,” he said.  Insights  EthDenver Shows That Ethereum Has an Actual Community  This weekend marks the culmination of ETHDenver, probably the most important annual gathering for smart contract and decentralized finance (DeFi) developers right now, on Ethereum and beyond. I wish I could be there this year, but I’m still recovering from a pretty intense four months of making cool things and exposing bad guys.  Fortunately, plenty of people are sharing clips from the event so I can enjoy it vicariously. Unfortunately, many of these posts express something between innocent confusion and sneering takedowns of the supposedly lame ETHDenver goings-on.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  But that attitude, to paraphrase the fugitive philosopher-thief Do Kwon, is a great formula for getting rekt. It may look like silliness and disorganization to you, but ETHDenver’s rough edges are actually strong signals that a real community has been drawn together by shared interests to build something together from the ground up. That’s the kind of community that has and will weather slow periods of crypto growth like what we’re going through right now.  See also: Tensions Erupt Between Aptos, Sui Blockchains in Denver  It’s hip to be cringe  It’s true that compared to a lot of crypto conferences ETHDenver and certain related events can seem just the slightest bit slapdash, and more than the slightest bit bizarre. Take, for instance, the annual contributions from Jonathan Mann, aka “The Song a Day Guy.” He has created and performed goofy, slightly amateurish tunes for the event for a while now – and every year people on Twitter take the opportunity to dunk on him.  But let me tell you, a goofy song is barely the only thing at ETHDenver that might make you uncomfortable!  When I attended last year, ETHDenver was held in a refurbished parking garage, where the bathrooms were partly or entirely broken for much of the event. You couldn’t see the main stage from roughly a third of the ground floor seating, and people talking at the back of the room halfway drowned out the speakers. Every once in a while, someone would drop 500 pizzas on an upstairs table, resulting in massive queues that made it nearly impossible to move.  And you know what? It was awesome.
