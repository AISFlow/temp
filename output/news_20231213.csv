Whether you want to know: how to create a cryptocurrency coin, how to create a cryptocurrency wallet, how to create a cryptocurrency exchange or a digital wallet, this guide is your comprehensive resource for turning your digital currency idea into reality. Understanding Cryptocurrency Creation The creation of a cryptocurrency is a complex endeavor that intertwines technological savvy with an understanding of market dynamics. At its core, cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency secured by cryptography, making it nearly immune to counterfeiting or double-spending. But beyond its security features, creating a cryptocurrency involves a series of strategic decisions and technical developments. First and foremost, understanding the blockchain technology that underpins most cryptocurrencies is crucial. This decentralized ledger records all transactions across a network of computers, ensuring transparency and security. When you set out to create a cryptocurrency, you’re essentially developing a new blockchain or modifying an existing one to support your new coin. The process starts with a clear purpose: What problem is your cryptocurrency solving? Who is it for? The answers to these questions will guide the design and functionality of your currency. Following this, a detailed whitepaper is typically crafted, outlining the project’s goals, technology, and mechanics. This document is vital for attracting investors and users. Choosing a consensus mechanism is another critical step. It’s the protocol that confirms transactions and adds them to the blockchain. Popular mechanisms include Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS), each with its own benefits and trade-offs in terms of security, energy consumption, and speed. How To Create A Cryptocurrency: Key Steps Creating a cryptocurrency is a venture that requires meticulous planning and a strategic approach. It’s not merely about coding or technical aspects; it involves a clear vision and a roadmap to bring that vision to life. Here are the core steps to guide you through this process: #1 Specify The Purpose Of Your Cryptocurrency Before diving into the technicalities of cryptocurrency creation, it’s crucial to define the purpose of your digital currency. What gap in the market is it filling? Is it aimed at enhancing privacy, improving transaction speed, or maybe serving a specific community or industry? Your cryptocurrency’s purpose will not only guide its technical development but also help in marketing it to the right audience. A well-defined purpose serves as the foundation of your cryptocurrency project, ensuring that every subsequent step aligns with this overarching goal. #2 Create A Whitepaper A whitepaper is an essential document in the world of cryptocurrency. It serves as a comprehensive guide that details your cryptocurrency project. The most famous example is the Bitcoin whitepaper. This document should include: Introduction: A brief overview of the cryptocurrency market and the specific problem your coin seeks to solve. Technical Details: Explain the technology behind your cryptocurrency, including the blockchain, consensus mechanism, and any unique features or innovations. Use Cases: Clearly articulate how your cryptocurrency will be used and its benefits to potential users or investors. Roadmap: Provide a timeline of development stages, from inception to launch and beyond. Team: Introduce the team behind the cryptocurrency, highlighting their expertise and roles. Legal Considerations: Address any regulatory aspects relevant to your cryptocurrency. A well-crafted whitepaper is not just a technical document; it’s a marketing tool that can attract investors, partners, and early adopters. It should be clear, concise, and compelling, effectively communicating the uniqueness and value proposition of your cryptocurrency. #3 Blockchain Architecture: Choose A Consensus Mechanism The consensus mechanism is a fundamental component for anyone looking how to create a cryptocurrency, serving as the protocol to validate transactions and maintain the integrity of the network. There are several types of consensus mechanisms, each with its own advantages and trade-offs: Proof of Work (PoW): Used by Bitcoin, Dogecoin and others, this mechanism requires miners to solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain. It’s secure but energy-intensive. Proof of Stake (PoS): Unlike PoW, PoS involves validators who are chosen to create new blocks based on the number of coins they hold and are willing to “stake” as collateral. It’s more energy-efficient than PoW. Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS): A variation of PoS, where coin holders vote for a small number of delegates who then validate transactions and create blocks. Proof of Authority (PoA): In PoA, transactions and blocks are validated by approved accounts, known as validators. It’s fast and efficient but less decentralized. Proof of Space (PoSpace): This mechanism allows users to utilize their unused hard drive space to participate in the blockchain network. Your choice of consensus mechanism will impact the scalability, security, and decentralization of your cryptocurrency. Consider your cryptocurrency’s purpose and requirements when selecting the appropriate mechanism. Design Your Blockchain Architecture Designing your blockchain architecture is a critical step in creating your cryptocurrency. This involves making key decisions on various aspects of the blockchain: Public Vs Private: Decide whether your blockchain will be public, accessible to anyone (like Bitcoin), or private, restricted to certain participants. Permissioned Vs Permissionless: In a permissioned blockchain, only authorized users can participate in certain activities, while a permissionless blockchain allows anyone to join and contribute. Block Time: Determine the time taken to mine or create a new block in your blockchain. This affects transaction speed and throughput. Consensus Algorithm: Implement your chosen consensus mechanism. Smart Contracts: Decide if your blockchain will support smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms directly written into code. Interoperability: Consider how your blockchain will interact with other blockchains and systems. This is crucial for wider adoption and functionality. Scalability Solutions: Plan for future growth in transaction volume, possibly incorporating solutions like layer-2 protocols or sharding. Each decision in designing your blockchain architecture should align with the overall purpose of your cryptocurrency, ensuring that it meets the intended use cases and target audience’s needs effectively. The Blockchain Trilemma In the world of blockchain and cryptocurrency, the “Blockchain Trilemma” is a crucial concept that addresses the challenges of balancing three key properties: decentralization, security, and scalability. Understanding and navigating this trilemma is essential for anyone looking how to create a cryptocurrency, as it directly impacts the effectiveness and potential success of the digital currency. Decentralization: This refers to the distribution of power and control away from a central authority. A decentralized blockchain allows for more democratic and equitable control, but achieving this often requires trade-offs in terms of scalability and sometimes security. Security: The integrity and safety of the blockchain are paramount. A secure blockchain protects against attacks and fraud, ensuring that transactions are irreversible and the network is reliable. However, heightened security measures can sometimes hinder scalability and require more centralized control mechanisms. Scalability: This is the ability of the blockchain to handle a growing number of transactions. For a cryptocurrency to be widely adopted, it must scale efficiently, but increasing scalability can compromise decentralization and security. When designing a cryptocurrency, it’s essential to strike a balance among these three aspects. Each decision made in the blockchain architecture, from the consensus mechanism to the network structure, influences this balance. For instance, choosing Proof of Work (PoW) might offer excellent security but can limit scalability and lead to centralization through mining pools. On the other hand, Proof of Stake (PoS) can improve scalability and decentralization but might present different security challenges. #4 Code It Or Copy It? When it comes to the actual development of your cryptocurrency, you’re faced with a crucial decision: should you code your cryptocurrency from scratch or utilize an existing blockchain as a foundation? Each approach has its benefits and challenges, and the choice largely depends on your technical expertise, resources, and specific goals for your cryptocurrency. How To Create A Cryptocurrency Coin? Copy It Using an existing blockchain as a foundation to create your cryptocurrency is a practical choice, especially for those with limited coding expertise or resources. This approach offers two options: copying the code of a blockchain or creating a token on an existing blockchain, like Ethereum, Cardano or Solana. For the latter option, we have already written an extensive guide: How To Create A Crypto Token. Here are the essential steps to do so (in short): Choose A Platform: Select a blockchain platform that supports the creation of new tokens. Ethereum, for instance, is popular for its robustness and flexibility, thanks to its ERC-20 token standard. Understand The Standards: Familiarize yourself with the token standards of your chosen platform. These standards define the rules for creating and managing tokens. Customize Your Token: Utilize existing templates or tools provided by the platform to customize your token. This includes defining the token’s properties, such as supply, divisibility, and how it can be transferred. Deploy The Token: Once your token is designed, deploy it onto the blockchain. This usually involves interacting with the blockchain through a smart contract. Test And Launch: Thoroughly test your token to ensure it functions as intended before officially launching it. This method is less time-consuming and often more cost-effective than building a blockchain from scratch. However, it offers less flexibility and customization in terms of the underlying blockchain technology. Create A Cryptocurrency From Scratch Creating a cryptocurrency from scratch involves building a new blockchain or modifying an existing open-source blockchain. This approach is more complex but allows for greater customization and innovation. The steps include: Define The Blockchain’s Properties: Decide on the key characteristics of your blockchain, such as block size, consensus mechanism, and reward system. Develop The Core Blockchain Code: Write the code for your blockchain or modify existing open-source code. This step requires significant coding expertise and understanding of blockchain technology. Test The Blockchain: Rigorously test the blockchain to ensure its security, scalability, and functionality. Launch A Node Network: Set up a network of nodes to maintain the blockchain. This network can be centralized or decentralized, depending on your project’s needs. Release The Coin: After thorough testing, release your coin on the blockchain for public use. Creating a cryptocurrency from scratch offers maximum control and the ability to tailor the cryptocurrency to specific needs. However, it demands significant technical skill, time, and resources. It’s best suited for projects that require unique features or high levels of customization not offered by existing platforms. #5 Audit Your Blockchain After developing your cryptocurrency, whether from scratch or by using an existing platform, the next critical step is auditing your blockchain. A blockchain audit involves a thorough review of the cryptocurrency’s codebase and network operations to ensure its security, functionality, and overall integrity. Here’s how to conduct an effective blockchain audit: Code Review: Engage expert developers to scrutinize your blockchain’s code for any vulnerabilities, bugs, or inefficiencies. This is crucial for identifying potential security threats like exploits or weaknesses that could be targeted by hackers. Smart Contract Audit: If your blockchain involves smart contracts (self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into lines of code), have these audited as well. Smart contract audits focus on ensuring the code performs as expected and is free from security flaws. Performance Testing: Conduct stress tests on your blockchain to assess its performance under different conditions. This includes testing scalability, transaction processing speed, and network resilience. Security Assessment: Employ cybersecurity experts to perform a comprehensive security assessment. This often includes penetration testing, where ethical hackers attempt to exploit any vulnerabilities in your system. Audit Report: The final step is to compile an audit report detailing the findings, including any vulnerabilities discovered and recommendations for addressing them. This report is valuable for improving your blockchain and building trust with users and investors. A thorough audit not only ensures the security and efficiency of your cryptocurrency but also enhances its credibility in the market. #6 Verify Legal Compliance Cryptocurrency operates in a rapidly evolving legal landscape, and ensuring compliance with relevant laws and regulations is essential. Legal compliance not only protects you from potential liabilities but also instills confidence in your users and investors. Here are steps to verify legal compliance for your cryptocurrency: Understand The Regulations: Familiarize yourself with the laws and regulations pertaining to cryptocurrency in your target markets. This includes knowing the rules around anti-money laundering (AML), know your customer (KYC) policies, securities laws, and tax obligations. Engage Legal Experts: Consult with legal professionals who specialize in cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. They can provide tailored advice on how to structure your cryptocurrency to comply with legal requirements. Compliance Mechanisms: Implement necessary mechanisms to ensure compliance. For instance, if your cryptocurrency is classified as a security, you must follow the relevant securities regulations, which may include registering with governmental bodies and providing disclosures to investors. Regulatory Reviews: The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies is constantly changing. Regularly review and update your compliance strategies to stay in line with new laws and regulations. Transparent Communication: Be transparent about your compliance measures with your users and investors. Clear communication about legal adherence can build trust and legitimacy. Verifying legal compliance is not just about avoiding legal issues; it’s about establishing a foundation of trust and reliability for your cryptocurrency in the long term. How Long Does It Take To Create A Cryptocurrency?

This rally was not exactly out of the blue as activity had begun to pick up once more on the Avalanche network. During this time, the open interest has risen rapidly as well, eventually touching a new all-time high. Avalanche Open Interest Rises To $413 Million On Tuesday, the Avalanche open interest rose to the highest level since its launch following AVAX’s surge to $40. The open interest reached $413 million on December 12 after continuously rising for over a month. The surge happened in tandem with the price surge and has made daily highs almost every day in December. Related Reading: Here’s How Much You Would Have If You Bought Bitcoin When Jim Cramer Said Sell The surge began in October after trailing around $70 million for the better part of a month. However, in November, there was a noticeable change in the open interest as traders began to take their positions in the digital asset. Source: Coinglass Between November and December, the AVAX open interest has risen by over 400%. On Tuesday alone, the open interest grew another 19%, bringing the total Avalanche open interest across all exchanges to 11.43 million AVAX. 73% of the total open interest is actually coming from only two exchanges; Binance and ByBit. According to data from Coinglass, Binance accounts for 44% of the total OI at $184 million (4.54 million AVAX), while ByBit accounts for 28.8% of the OI with $119.67 million (2.95 million AVAX). BingX, OKX, and Bitget make up the rest of the top 5 with $50.37 million, $43.7 million, and $41.8 million, respectively. Token price retraces to $36 | Source: AVAXUSD on Tradingview.com Rise In OI Sending AVAX Price To $100? While the Avalanche open interest has soared to a new all-time high, there is still a long way to go for the AVAX price before it reaches its all-time high of $146. Nevertheless, the rise in open interest is still incredibly bullish for the price. Related Reading: Bitcoin Vulnerability Discovered By A Developer Has Been Flagged By The US Government As proven by historical performance, the price of AVAX has often risen whenever the open interest has been on the rise. This was the case between 2021 and 2022 when the price of the altcoin rose above $100 before eventually crashing in 2022. If the Avalanche open interest continues to rise from here, it is expected that AVAX will follow through. A break in OI over $500 million will no doubt see the altcoin clear the coveted $50 level once more. However, $100 still looks to be a long way from here and will likely be reached sometime in 2024.

While the U.S. central bank officials left the Fed funds rate at 5.25%-5.5% on Wednesday concluding the December Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, they projected the rate would come down to 4.6% by the end of 2024, indicating roughly three 25 basis point cuts.  Bond yields and the U.S. dollar index (DXY) fell sharply on the Fed's dovish projection, supporting a broad-market rally for risk-assets including stocks and cryptocurrencies.  BTC, the largest crypto asset, surpassed $43,000 by late U.S. afternoon hours, climbing almost 5% from below $41,000 earlier in the day.  Large-cap tokens of Avalanche [AVAX], Cardano [ADA] and Injective [INJ] posted near 10% gains, making the CoinDesk Smart Contract Platform Index [SMT] the best-performing among CoinDesk's crypto sectors.  The CoinDesk Market Index [CMI], which tracks a weighted basket of almost 200 digital assets, was up 3.8% over the past 24 hours.  Crypto-related stocks also bursted higher. Crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) closed the trading session almost 8% higher, while Michael Saylor's MicroStrategy (MSTR) gained 5%.  U.S.-listed bitcoin miners Marathon Digital (MARA), Riot Platforms (RIOT), CleanSpark (CLSK) – often seen as a leveraged bet on BTC – were up 8%-16% through the day.

42409233,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcEsXd,1702506814,CFTC Pushes FTX-Inspired Rule to Protect Customers' Money,"The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission took a step toward requiring derivatives clearing organizations, a key type of intermediary in the industry, to keep their customers' money segregated from their own funds.  The CFTC's move is at least partially inspired by FTX's collapse last year, designed to prevent derivatives firms from meddling with money belonging to their clients. In FTX's case, billions of dollars of customer money was stolen.  In a vote Wednesday, CFTC commissioners voted to publish the proposal for public feedback, a key step in the process to enact a rule that would apply to any companies under the commodities regulator's umbrella. If a DCO faces a liquidity crunch, such as a crypto exchange facing high number of withdrawal requests, customer funds would be protected, according to the proposed rule's goals.  ""It's an important proposal because I think there are a lot of outstanding questions about policy risk and the law,"" said Chairman Rostin Behnam, who voted for the proposal. ""In the past two or three years, we've seen an advent of new market participants with new ideas about how markets function and what they view as the most efficient sort of execution models for for their business, whether it's in traditional finance or obviously we're seeing this in a lot of the crypto space.""  The proposal would allow DCOs to commingle ""proprietary funds"" from different clearing members, referring to any funds or property held by a DCO on behalf of a clearing member, but the regulator would not let any commingling of proprietary funds, customer funds or the DCO's funds.  The collapse of FTX – the company whose one-time LedgerX affiliate tried to blaze a trail at the CFTC in clearing customer transactions without middlemen – was a ""significant motivation"" for this proposal, said Commissioner Kristin Johnson, who offered ""a full-throated"" vote in favor of the proposal.  Johnson said FTX illustrates ""the magnitude of losses that customers may experience in the absence of regulation that prohibits commingling of customer funds or member property.""  Commissioner Summer Mersinger, who cast one of the two ""no"" votes, said during her round of questioning that she would have liked more time to review some of the issues in the proposal and expressed concern that some issues hadn't been addressed. She would have liked to have seen a discussion comparing the proposal's requirements with existing DCOs, as well as a cost-benefit analysis for the proposal.  ""Customer protection is foundational to the work we do here at the CFTC, but that does not absolve us of our responsibility to perform a cost-benefit analysis,"" Mersinger said.  Read more: Ex-FTX Unit LedgerX in Gray Area Beyond CFTC Proposal on Customer Funds: Commissioner  Commissioner Caroline Pham, who voted to concur (essentially an abstention that supports the majority of the votes cast), opened her statement by saying the agency ""already has extensive rules in place"" for protecting customer customer funds at futures commission merchants – essentially, a broker in the derivatives industry – and warning that the regulator must be careful in how it changes existing regulatory frameworks.  ""If the commission anticipates this type of DCO clearing model to proliferate, we should step back and consider all issues these direct clearing DCOs raise,"" she said.  Commissioner Christy Goldsmith Romero, who also voted against the proposal, commented on how the actual crypto investors using a platform would be the members of a clearing organization that did not have FCMs as intermediaries, rather than customers as they would typically be defined in CFTC regulations.  ""We're basically sort of putting these regular people – in, like, retail – in the role of an FCM,"" she said, referring to the disintermediated companies seeking to cut futures commission merchants out of the process. ""Do you think that the regular people, the individuals who are involved in these matters, understand that they're not a customer, they don't have this access to to all the customer protections?""",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,"Nikhilesh De, Jesse Hamilton",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/12/13/cftc-pushes-ftx-inspired-rule-to-protect-customers-money,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e0dc1e8b4cca5037925d0ee312f42162a65fcbb7-4032x2268.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42409252,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcF2jA,1702506438,Anonymous Crypto Interests Bombard Key Senator Sherrod Brown With Political Ads,"U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, is arguably the most important lawmaker currently standing in the way of a crypto regulation bill, and industry interests have paid for a new campaign in his own back yard to nudge him.  The brand new Cedar Innovation Foundation – a crypto-backed organization that won't identify who is funding it, according to an official there – is pushing videos at younger voters in Ohio's metro areas, which suggest the Securities and Exchange Commission run by Chair Gary Gensler is forcing technology jobs overseas and stifling innovation to favor his friends on Wall Street.  ""Tell Sherrod Brown to stand up to Gary Gensler,"" one of the ads implores. ""Fight for Ohio jobs.""  Brown has been highly critical of the consumer dangers in the cryptocurrency sector, and he isn't moving significant crypto legislation through his committee so far, despite several of his members from both parties having authored bills. When he addressed crypto oversight at the SEC, he praised the agency's aggressive enforcement posture and encouraged it to keep going.  Cedar said it had made a ""six-figure"" state-wide digital ad buy and added that it's prepared to devote millions more through 2024. With its shadowy funding, the nonprofit will sponsor ""educational workshops, networking receptions, and training seminars throughout the year for all congressional staff and policymakers.""  The campaign to influence Brown is the first foray.  ""SEC Chair Gary Gensler is protecting the big banks, stifling American innovation and willing to ship critical American technology and jobs to China,"" according to the organization's website. ""Senator Sherrod Brown needs to use his power as Chair of the Senate Banking Committee to stand up to Gensler and fight for Ohio jobs.""  Brown, who's been in office for 16 years, faces a reelection battle that's expected to be tight. In the 2020 presidential election, Ohio strongly favored the Republican candidate, former President Donald Trump.  Spokespeople for the SEC, where Gensler often speaks in his own informational videos that routinely warn about the risks of digital assets, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on the campaign.

Whale Transfers Over $780 Million Of Stablecoin To Binance,"Data Nerd Data on December 13 shows that over the past 24 hours, the wallet “0xea8” moved 200 million BUSD from Binance, the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchange by client count. The whale transfer caught the attention of keen crypto users, who also noted that the transfer was soon followed by a deposit of 99.95 million FDUSD, a stablecoin supported by the exchange. Whale Address Accumulating FUSD Stablecoin On Binance That the address is shuffling and accumulating large amounts of stablecoins is noteworthy. Data Nerd Data shows that the address has transferred over 781 million FDUSD to Binance in the last four months. During this period, from around September, the crypto market has been recovering, edging higher on the back of improving fundamental factors. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Bucks Bearish Trend: Large Holder Netflow Rises 1079% To 4.68 Trillion SHIB The accumulation of over $781 million of stablecoin by the wallet controlled by an unknown individual or entity is overly bullish for crypto and Bitcoin prices. It could suggest that a large institutional investor or group of investors is amassing stablecoins, potentially preparing for a significant market move. Historically, large movements of stablecoins into centralized exchanges have often preceded major bull runs. Stablecoins are vital for crypto, ensuring there is enough liquidity. Since most are pegged to the USD and can be backed by fiat, these tokens, mostly minted on Ethereum or Tron, are often used as a gateway to crypto. Therefore, their accumulation can signal increased institutional interest and potential buying pressure. Is A Mega Bitcoin And Crypto Rally In The Making? That the wallet address is fortifying its FDUSD base reinforces the notion that institutional investors, ahead of the possible approval of the first batch of Bitcoin ETFs in the United States, could be increasingly warming up and preparing for leading coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum to extend gains in 2024. When writing on December 13, Bitcoin and top altcoin prices are relatively stable. To illustrate, Bitcoin is trending higher, stable above the $41,000 level after pulling back from 2023 highs of around $44,000. Crypto participants are bullish and expect Bitcoin prices to float even higher in 2024 before halving. Binance will stop supporting BUSD in 2024. The exchange has also delisted USDC. Accordingly, USDT and FUSD are popular on Binance. However, the exchange continues to be on the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) crosshairs.

42409246,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcF2Ii,1702503392,The Tether Killer? A True Stablecoin Would Enhance Banking and Crypto,"On Tuesday, ratings agency S&P published a report examining eight of the leading stablecoins, finding many are deficient.  Arguably, a pegged U.S. dollar stablecoin would not only safely increase the money supply, but actually improve the money supply. In fact, it would enhance U.S. economic growth by splitting our money supply in two.  One part – the pegged stablecoin – would be used to transact faster and cheaper. The other part – the U.S. dollars held in bank accounts – would be used to lower the cost of borrowing USD.  Daniel Wheeler (www.thefintech.lawyer) is an entrepreneur and a lawyer who advises banks, fintechs, and crypto startups.  Only a specific kind of stablecoin would yield these economic benefits. Any coin that promises “yield,” “earnings” or “dividends” is presumably a security and any transaction with that coin would trigger capital gains tax.  Even if the stablecoin was structured like Tether (which S&P negatively assessed) with no yield promised to holders, there likely would be little benefit to the U.S. money supply and economy if the stablecoin's portfolio of assets was not strictly limited to dollars in a bank account.  The serious, potentially fatal flaw with a stablecoin like Tether is the potential for a “run on the bank.” Any stablecoin that invests in anything other than U.S. dollars in a bank account cannot assure its holders that they can redeem their stablecoin at any time, all at once, and receive 100% of the face value of the stablecoin.  A coin like Tether depends upon the black swan event never happening. A true stablecoin can be sold and redeemed for exactly $1 and is assumed to never fluctuate in value. It does not pay yield and does not appreciate. There is no reason to “hodl” such a stablecoin.  However, it is assumed that stablecoins are faster and easier to transact with and more valuable for transactions than fiat currency. This superior functionality would drive demand, meaning a stablecoin issuer/sponsor could profitably operate the stablecoin by retaining the fiat currency yield paid by the custodian bank for the U.S. dollar deposits.  At the same time, a true stablecoin would not chase the same goods and services as fiat currency because it would be high velocity money only used to transact. The dollar deposits held in a bank account to back the stablecoin would be stable long-term deposits that would allow the bank to lend at lower rates.  Therefore, a true pegged stablecoin would (1) expand the money supply without causing inflation and (2) lower the cost of borrowing fiat currency.  Such a stablecoin presents none of the problems of a central bank digital currency (CBDC). It fits easily into existing law, does not harm the banking system and prevents the government from using currency as a weapon of surveillance and control.",NEUTRAL,없음,FIAT | REGULATION | USDT,Daniel Wheeler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/12/13/the-tether-killer-a-true-stablecoin-would-enhance-banking-and-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d31629581c4d4f8d6cc95d29632609547664c3a2-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This correction understandably shook up some investors in the market, who rushed to panic sell in order to avoid more losses. Once the selling began to die down, the price of the cryptocurrency has been on a slow but steady recovery. Amid this, one crypto analyst has predicted that there could be further upside to come for Bitcoin. Bitcoin Price Could Retest $69,000 Currently, $69,000 is the holy grail when it comes to price targets for Bitcoin because this remains the asset’s all-time high price. While the price is only at $40,000, it is important to note that it will only take another 70% move from here for the price to reach a new all-time high. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Gain Slows Down: Glassnode’s Fair Value Models Puts The Crypto At $36,000 On the topic of reclaiming this all-time high price, crypto analyst Weslad took to TradingView to share their most recent analysis of Bitcoin. According to Weslad, the Bitcoin price could be gearing up for a retest that could take it back to $69,000. This retest is confirmed by the appearance of a cup and handle pattern that suggests a further upside for the price. As the crypto analyst points out, Bitcoin completed a neckline breakout of a cup and handle pattern when it surged above $31,800 and continued to rise. This completed the cup and handle pattern, and is “now serving as immediate support and demand,” Weslad explained. The completion of this pattern is also a major factor for an upcoming rally. This is because the pattern is yet to complete the breakout and has not reached its final target yet. As the chart shared by the analyst shows, the current correction is expected and the final target for this pattern sits somewhere around $69,000. BTC price sitting at $41,200 | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com BTC Price Could Go One Of Two Directions While the possibility of a Bitcoin breakout does remain high due to the completion of the cup and handle pattern, there is still more than one scenario that could play out from here. Naturally, the two possible scenarios here are either bullish or bearish. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Rally To $0.0001? Shibarium Transaction Count Breaches 90 Million Milestone Weslad presents two scenarios with the first one being an upward rally. The analyst explains that this rally, marked Scenario A, could come as a result of the sustained support at the Handle’s target zone. In this case, there is resistance for the BTC price between $48,000 and $50,000. Moving on to the next scenario, Scenario B is the bulls failing to surmount the expected resistance at $48,000 and $50,000. In such a case, the analyst suggests that the Bitcoin price could correct further down, going as low as the Neckline at $31,000, which currently acts as a critical support zone.

21355479,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=565287,1702497633,"Bitcoin Price Surges On Positive News: FASB’s Fair Value Recognition Reignites $42,000 Support Recovery","The Bitcoin price experienced a notable downturn as selling pressure intensified, resulting in a decline of over 4% from its annual peak of $44,500. This downturn was further exacerbated by the loss of the crucial $42,000 support level. However, the largest cryptocurrency in the market received a substantial uplift from the US Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), which has spurred a rapid 1.8% surge in BTC’s value within the past two hours. As a result, Bitcoin has successfully recovered the $42,000 support level. FASB’s Fair Value Recognition Brings Clarity To BTC? In a significant development for the cryptocurrency industry, the FASB has announced new accounting rules that require companies, including prominent entities like MicroStrategy, Tesla, and Block, to measure their cryptocurrency holdings at fair value. These rules, set to go into effect in 2025, allow businesses to capture the real-time highs and lows of their Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) assets, providing a more accurate representation of their holdings. Related Reading: OKX DEX Loses Over $400,000 To Hackers – What Happens To Customer Funds? Under the previous accounting practices, companies were only allowed to record the lows, resulting in a one-sided accounting treatment that often led to reduced valuations and diminished earnings for businesses holding cryptocurrencies. The highly volatile nature of crypto values further exacerbated the issue. The FASB’s new rules address these concerns by mandating the recording of cryptocurrencies at fair value, a measurement technique aimed at reflecting the most up-to-date value of these assets. Changes in fair value will now be recorded in net income, allowing companies to account for fluctuations in the value of their crypto holdings more comprehensively. The positive news for BTC lies in the fact that the new FASB rules provide greater transparency and accuracy in assessing the true value of cryptocurrency assets. By capturing fluctuations in fair value, companies will have a more realistic representation of their holdings, enabling better decision-making and financial reporting. Bitcoin, being the most widely recognized and valuable cryptocurrency, stands to benefit significantly from these changes. The recognition of its fair value allows companies to showcase the true worth of their BTC holdings, potentially boosting investor confidence and attracting further institutional interest. Turbulent Times Ahead For Bitcoin Price Following these recent developments, the Bitcoin price has successfully rebounded to previously lost levels, demonstrating heightened volatility after a brief consolidation phase just below $42,000. However, according to CoinGlass’ liquidation heatmap, Bitcoin’s price may be facing further volatility that could lead to a significant amount of liquidation of both long and short positions. The liquidation heatmap from CoinGlass highlights substantial indications of liquidation leverage exceeding $200 million both above and below the current Bitcoin price. Of particular concern is the thick liquidation leverage below $41,000, as seen in the chart above, which, combined with the prevailing trend, could become a probable target for the Bitcoin price in the coming days. Related Reading: Santiment Points Out Trigger Behind 65% Cardano Rally Conversely, following BTC’s correction, additional liquidation leverage has emerged in CoinGlass’s heatmap, particularly in the $42,000 and $43,000 range of short positions. This added selling pressure has contributed to the retracement of the Bitcoin price. This potential scenario suggests a potential price swing up and down before a stable continuation of either the downward or upward momentum. The outcome remains uncertain as to which side will give way first and what prevailing trend will shape the latter part of the year.

42409244,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcF2FP,1702497409,Ethereum's Buterin Floats Prospect of Taking Some Layer-2 Functions Back on Main Chain,"Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, who argued three years ago for pushing more of the blockchain's computational load onto affiliated networks known as ""layer-2 networks"" or ""rollups,"" has just outlined a plan to take some of the functions back onto the main chain.  His idea for an ""enshrined zkEVM"" could prove disruptive, since prominent layer-2 projects, including ""ZK-rollups"" from Polygon, Matter Labs and Scroll, have invested heavily in fulfilling the earlier roadmap. The new networks are already up and running, and the project leaders have been working to recruit developers and already attracted billions of dollars in user deposits.  The acronym ""zkEVM"" is a mash-up of ""zk,"" which stands for ""zero knowledge,"" a type of cryptography that is seen as the leading technology for powering future generations of blockchains; and ""EVM,"" which stands for Ethereum Virtual Machine, the programming environment that most Ethereum applications run on.  The new rollup networks from Polygon, Matter Labs and Scroll each have some version of a zkEVM baked into their systems. The networks work by bundling up transactions from users – to lessen the load on Ethereum and speed things up for end-users. They pass the bundled transactions back down to the ""layer 1"" Ethereum network with a cryptographic guarantee, called a zero-knowledge proof, that they have been recorded correctly.  In his latest blog post, posted on the Ethereum Foundation's website, Buterin wrote that so-called ""light clients"" – a skimpier and less data-intensive way to read and verify data on a blockchain, as opposed to hardware-heavy full nodes – will get ""more and more powerful"" over the next few years. Ethereum's light clients will ""pretty soon get to the point"" where they can use zero-knowledge cryptography to fully verify transactions executed on the layer-1 chain.  ""At that point, the Ethereum network will effectively have a built-in zkEVM,"" Buterin wrote. ""So the question arises: Why not make that zkEVM natively available for rollups too?""  What's left for layer-2 blockchains?  Buterin's comments come as ether [ETH], the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, has lagged behind tokens from rival blockchains as digital-asset markets rallied this year. Ether has climbed by 84%, while Solana's SOL has jumped more than eight-fold in price and Avalanche's AVAX has tripled. Bitcoin, the biggest cryptocurrency, has gained 153%.  According to Buterin, who has for years pushed Ethereum down a ""rollup-centric"" roadmap, there would still be a role for the layer-2 networks under his new plan.  ""The EVM verification functionality, which layer-2 teams currently implement by themselves, would be handled by the protocol, but layer 2 projects would still be responsible for many important functions,"" he wrote.  It gets pretty technical, but those would include ""fast pre-confirmations,"" ""MEV mitigation strategies,"" ""extensions to the EVM"" and ""user and developer-facing conveniences,"" according to Buterin.  ""Layer 2 teams do a lot of work attracting users and projects to their ecosystems and making them feel welcome,"" Buterin wrote. ""They are compensated for this by capturing MEV and congestion fees inside their networks. This relationship would continue.""",NEUTRAL,ETH | SOL,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MATIC | SOL | TRADING,Bradley Keoun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/12/13/ethereums-buterin-floats-prospect-of-taking-some-layer-2-functions-back-on-main-chain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b193e3c791a6f1444659e4ebe59141b6a145953b-999x562.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

As highly regulated U.S. banks are unable to hold bitcoin themselves, this set-up would enable the likes of JPMorgan or Goldman Sachs – firms with some of the largest balance sheets in the world – to act as APs to BlackRock's ETF.  China to Verify Citizens' Identities With New Blockchain-Based Platform  KuCoin to Pay $22M, Exit New York to Settle State Suit  Ordinals Inscriptions Have Generated $148M for Bitcoin Miners  Loyal readers of The Protocol will recall our riff in last week's issue, headlined ""Bitcoin Censorship, or Just 'Spam Filtering?'"" The gist of the story is that some Bitcoin purists are trying to keep the oldest and largest blockchain free from non-financial transactions – such as the text snippets and images that some people are ""inscribing"" onto the blockchain via the Ordinals protocol, launched late last year. The drama ratched up recently when Ocean, a new bitcoin mining pool backed by Jack Dorsey and co-led by a longtime Bitcoin developer, the pseudonymous (and feisty) Luke Dashjr, set up software that would ""filter"" out the Ordinals inscriptions. A lot of users of the blockchain, however, say a few people shouldn't be deciding how the Bitcoin blockchain gets used; let the market decide, the thinking goes. That really amounts to a bet that Bitcoin miners, who ultimately decide which transactions to include in new data blocks and which ones to leave out, will choose to maximize self-interest, er, profits. And that makes them more likely to keep including these Bitcoin ""inscriptions"" because, you know, why leave money on the table? The chart below, courtesy of Dune Analytics, shows just how much in fees have been generated to date by inscriptions-related transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain – $147.7 million.  Fees (in dollars) paid to Bitcoin miners for Ordinals inscriptions. The green vertical lines (legend on left) show fees paid on a daily basis, while the black line (legend on right) shows cumulative fees since December 2022.

Why This Halving Could Be Different,"Summary Bitcoin has rallied over 20% in the last month, suggesting the bottom is in, and the bull market is approaching. Previous halving cycles have shown a similar price action, with Bitcoin rallying after the halving and reaching new all-time highs. However, with everyone expecting a halving rally, it's possible that the market may not behave as expected, and the final Bitcoin price target could be lower than anticipated. Thesis Summary Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has rallied over 20% in the last month, creating a strong confirmation for many that, indeed, the bottom is in and the bull market approaches. A lot of investors are now expecting Bitcoin to behave as it has done in many of the previous cycles, rallying into and after the halving. And most pundits also seem to believe Bitcoin will break above triple digits in this cycle. While this is an argument I have made myself before, I can’t help but wonder: Could this time be different? It’s unusual for markets to do exactly what everyone is expecting, and Bitcoin is no exception. What if we don’t rally after the halving? What if we don’t break above $100,000? In this article, I expand on this scenario. Keeping Up With Bitcoin Back in October, as Bitcoin broke above $35,000, I covered a few of the recent catalysts that had pushed Bitcoin up and discussed possible price targets for the coming bull market. Bitcoin has continued to confirm a bull market is underway, as it has soared past $45,000 in the last month. Bitcoin price chart (TradingView) Over the last 24 hours, however, Bitcoin has fallen close to 5%, which could be partly attributed to Elizabeth Warren’s latest crypto bill , which seeks to crack down on Bitcoin and self-custody. Nonetheless, a pull-back after this relentless rally seems like a necessary step before Bitcoin can continue higher. Overall, Bitcoin has so far followed the path laid out in our previous article: BTC TA (Author's work) Though we have not really seen a substantial sell-off until now, we have rallied into the $40,000-$50,000 region, which has always been a clear area of resistance. So Far So Good If we actually look at the long-term Bitcoin price history, this is playing out exactly as we would expect based on previous halving cycles. BTC cycle (Author's work) Bitcoin’s block reward gets halved every four years, with the next halving scheduled sometime around March/April 2024. In previous cycles, we have observed a very similar price action around the halving. Bitcoin rallies very strongly following the halving. It then tops and enters a bear market, giving up a lot of the bull market gains and leaving a lot of later investors underwater. Bitcoin then experiences a few months of consolidation ahead of the next halving. Bitcoin tends to bottom well in advance of the halving, but it doesn’t really take off until after the event. This is the period inside the orange box. In the chart above, I have also drawn three identical trendlines, going from the top of the bull market, which in the two previous cycles have limited the upside before halving. Quite interestingly, we reached this level in the last week, and we have now begun a reversal. Based on previous halving cycles, we might expect Bitcoin to move sideways or even sell off from here without breaking the previous low. Then, around March-April 2024, Bitcoin would rally after the halving, and most would expect it to reach new all-time highs, probably surpassing $100,000. Expect The Unexpected With that said, now that everyone is expecting a halving rally, it’s hard to imagine that this will play out exactly like everyone expects. When has the market been that easy to read? Once a narrative is expected and accepted, it is likely the opposite that happens, and one just needs to look at the past two years to understand this. Back when Bitcoin was at $60,000, everyone was expecting it to break above $100,000 too. Back when the S&P 500 was bottoming at 3600, everyone was expecting it to go even lower. When inflation was peaking at 9%, everyone was expecting this to continue, just as it reversed. This time could indeed be different, and there are other factors at play here. The Bitcoin ETF release has everyone excited, but much like the halving, this news is already getting priced in. Some believe a spot Bitcoin ETF could be approved as early as January. It seems like the spot Bitcoin ETF could come in some time around the Bitcoin halving. But with these two catalysts gone, what will propel Bitcoin higher? Indeed, I believe this could be a “sell the news” type of event. At the very least, even if the halving cycle does play out, it could happen a lot faster since everyone is expecting it, and the final Bitcoin price target could be a lot lower, leaving some unfortunate investors holding the proverbial bag. Technical Analysis Ultimately, it is impossible to know with 100% certainty what will happen, especially in the short term. I have shared before various possible price targets for Bitcoin based on different Elliott Wave targets. I share below the most conservative target. Bitcoin TA (Author's work) The Guideline of Equality says that two of the motive sub-waves in a five wave sequence will tend toward equality, which is generally true of the non-extended waves. This means that, when Wave 3 of an impulse wave is the extended wave, Wave 5 will approximately equal Wave 1 in price. This is useful for potentially projecting the end of Wave 5 in an impulse if you recognize Wave 3 as an extended wave. Source: StockCharts We could definitely make an argument that the previous Wave 3, the rally that took us north of $60,000 was “extended”. In other words, the Wave 3 was in a nine-wave structure. Bitcoin TA (Author's work) This means that a reasonable target for our Wave 5, the next leg up in Bitcoin, could be somewhere around $68,000, which is where Wave 5 would be equal to Wave 1. Now, this is just a guideline and is not an imperative. Wave 5 could, in fact, also be extended. However, it would definitely take a lot of people by surprise if Bitcoin, in fact, topped just above the last cycle high. And in markets, surprises seem to be more likely. How Do We Play This? We have strong confirmation that a bull market is in play. The question is, how can investors best profit from it? The actions each investor takes will very much depend on the investment style one wishes to apply. Long-term investors would do well simply holding Bitcoin and accumulating it, not even bothering about the Bitcoin cycle. However, those wanting to try to take profits at the top, should be looking at selling earlier. But how do we know if this time, the Bitcoin cycle will be different? One indication will be the resistance line I have shown above. BTC cycle (Author's work) If we break above this resistance level before the halving, it would be a strong indication that Bitcoin might be getting ready to rally before the halving rather than after. On the other hand, investors must keep an eye on other important factors that move Bitcoin, which I discussed in my last article, such as the news and liquidity. In any case, it looks like the $70,000 area would be a good spot for a reversal, even within a larger structure that does take us north of $100,000. Risks Most people are now discounting the regulatory risk, since a spot Bitcoin ETF looks like a done deal. However, the recent bill introduced by Warren shows that Bitcoin is still under attack by many governments. On the other hand, since Bitcoin is so tied to liquidity, I don't think it will be immune to a deflationary recession, something which is becoming more likely in the past few months and could hit in 2024. Takeaway We will have to wait and see how things play out next year. For now, the recent dip does indeed seem like a reasonable place to add. I do expect Bitcoin to go much higher, but perhaps sooner than most expect and less high than they anticipate.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4657731-rally-or-retreat-why-this-halving-could-be-different?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/21353166.jpeg

21352860,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=565226,1702490457,"Crypto Pundit Predicts That XRP Price Will Rise “Dramatically,” Here’s When","Crypto analyst Austin Hilton is the latest to give his opinion on the future trajectory of the XRP price going forward. Specifically, Hilton noted two events that will spur XRP’s price to go up “dramatically.” The analyst also outlined other metrics that present a bullish sentiment for the XRP ecosystem. Major Events That Will Cause XRP Price To Rise In a video shared on his YouTube Channel, Hilton singled out the approval of Spot Bitcoin ETFs and the upcoming Bitcoin Halving as the two events that will cause XRP’s price to go up “dramatically.” He mentioned that the XRP price could rise to over $1.50 when the SEC approves these funds. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Cardano Price Will Rise 6000% To $33, Here’s The Timeline Bloomberg analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas currently predict that there is a 90% chance that a Spot BTC ETF will get approved by January 10. Although he had his reservations about that, he seemed optimistic that the SEC would approve these funds soon as the Commission is “running out of reasons to say no.” Once that happens, he expects his price prediction of $1.50 or over to materialize. He had referred to an article where another analyst predicted that XRP would hit this price level in March. However, he believes that it could happen in January or February, depending on how things go. Hilton was quick to point out the fact that these events (BTC Spot ETF & Bitcoin Halving) do not exactly relate to XRP. However, he stated that XRP, being a blue chip, will move up when the overall market moves up. Major altcoins have so far been beneficiaries of Bitcoin’s metric rise on the back of a possible Spot BTC ETF approval. As such, that could explain Hilton’s position on XRP’s rise. XRP bulls struggle to retain control | Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview.com On-Chain Metrics Suggest Bullish Sentiments For XRP The analyst also noted that on-chain metrics suggest a bullish outlook for the XRP ecosystem. These metrics include the number of daily transactions and wallet addresses on the XRP Ledger. According to him, this suggests that there is a “fair amount” of liquidity flowing into the ecosystem. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Rally To $0.0001?

42409260,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcF36J,1702488864,Why 2023 Is Like 2020 and Bitcoin Is Set to Head Towards $50k,"Bitcoin has recently achieved new highs in 2023, but there's a question lingering: Is the market over-extended, and have we reached the pinnacle of enthusiasm? We can gain insight into these inquiries by examining the positioning of the crypto options market.  The most apt comparison to Q4 2023 is the rally we saw in Q4 2020. In fact, by superimposing BTC returns for both years, we can discern a strikingly similar narrative unfolding.  (BTC spot performance 2020 [green] and 2023 [orange])  At present, the implied volatility of options (which represents an investor's bet on BTC's future realized volatility) is hovering near its 2023 peak, primarily driven by the buying of call options. This could indicate the market is already factoring in the explosive upside potential we're all hoping for.  Nevertheless, when we look back at the implied volatility of BTC over the past four years, it remains relatively subdued, implying that BTC hasn't yet demonstrated the explosive rally it is historically capable of. When BTC surged in Q4 2020, the accompanying option volatility peaked at around 150%, whereas today it stands at approximately 50%.  (BTC implied volatility for “at-the-money” options)  We can also draw a comparison between the historical futures basis today and that of January 1, 2020. Back then, the futures basis on Deribit was 20% annualized, equivalent to 17 times the 10-year risk-free rate. Today, the futures basis is around 10% or 2.4 times the equivalent risk-free rate. These substantial disparities between now and 2020 don't necessarily forecast higher spot prices, but they do suggest that potential buying power is still largely on the sidelines.  Finally, it's crucial to note that the implied volatility option traders are willing to pay is closely tied to the actual volatility that BTC is experiencing (realized volatility), which has hit new lows in 2023. This connection is often referred to as the Variance Risk Premium (VRP), and it has been widening since mid-October. Recently option traders have consistently been willing to pay a significant premium over realized volatility in BTC, anticipating the possibility of explosive movements.  (BTC “at-the-money” implied volatility Term Structure)  We’re currently witnessing an especially pronounced implied volatility “kink” higher for the January option expiration month. This reflects the anticipation that the Securities and Exchange Commission will approve/deny spot Bitcoin ETFs, causing markets to move.  The forward volatility (the actual implied volatility differential priced between the Dec. 29 expiration and the January contract) currently resides around 57%, a 12-point premium of about 30-day realized volatility of 45%.  This situation either suggests that option buyers are making incorrect and overpriced bets, or that substantial volatility in BTC will not only continue, but grow larger.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Greg Magadini,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/12/13/why-2023-is-like-2020-and-bitcoin-is-set-to-head-towards-50k,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cce8386001841d822cc8db9af3b6a46c7ee43eac-4749x3166.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

I expect short-term price volatility in Q1 2024, with uncertainty around the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF. The SEC's market manipulation concerns may delay the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF. Introduction What a year 2023 has been for Bitcoin USD ( BTC-USD ). The biggest crypto by market cap is up ~150% YTD. Mostly thanks to the widespread anticipation of a spot Bitcoin ETF approval, the sentiment and momentum for Bitcoin have been positive and strong for several months. This momentum has spread to other cryptocurrencies, like Solana USD ( SOL-USD ) and Avalanche ( AVAX-USD ) recording double-digit percentage gains for the first time since the FTX fiasco. Bitcoin kicked off the year with a new NFT ""hype"" and smart contract capabilities, made possible by the Ordinals protocol, with NFTs on the protocol seeing increasing floor prices. Mid-year, the world's largest asset manager BlackRock tipped its toes into crypto by applying for a spot in the Bitcoin ETF. Though this is not the first spot Bitcoin ETF application with the SEC, BlackRock's reputation in getting successful ETF approvals gave the crypto community and investors ""some guarantee"" or hope that a spot Bitcoin ETF will be approved sooner or later. The anticipation of this spot ETF approval coupled with the coming halving event have been the main catalysts propelling Bitcoin's price forward. Amidst the ETF approval euphoria and constant fervor generated by crypto influencers and crypto news websites, maintaining a steadfast focus on essential considerations becomes imperative for sound decision-making and risk mitigation. A Volatile Q1 2024 Looms Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval Deadline (Bloomberg) I am bullish on Bitcoin in the long term, but I believe short-term price volatility (amidst price correction) is imminent. Going into Q1 2024, the dates for the next deadlines for the spot Bitcoin ETF approvals are key dates to watch. I think that certain segments of the crypto community and influencers may be overly optimistic, displaying undue confidence in the swift approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF, particularly with high expectations for a potential ETF green light by January 5 - 10, 2024. Some industry watchers put the spot Bitcoin ETF approval odds at 90% by January 10, 2024. The prevailing speculation and confidence in the approval of a Bitcoin ETF by January 5 - 10 lack substantial basis in explicit data. The speculation is largely driven by the ETF applicants' meetings with the SEC, updates to their ETF prospectuses, and listing prospective spot Bitcoin ETFs tickers on the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation ((DTCC)). While these are noteworthy advancements in the ETF approval process, they are also standard procedures, and they do not guarantee a spot Bitcoin ETF approval by the widely anticipated dates. Analysts and crypto news outlets often sensationalize SEC meetings with the Bitcoin ETF applicants, framing them as attention-grabbing headlines. It is important to recognize that these meetings and updates to ETF prospectuses are standard procedures and should not be sensationalized beyond their procedural nature. There's no data of any kind except for analytics relating to crypto speculation, which is inherently suspect (e.g., the reported 90% likelihood of the SEC's approval of a bitcoin spot ETF, which is absolutely absurd). - John Reed Stark , Former Chief, SEC Office of Internet Enforcement On October 23, BTC saw an over 14% single-day price surge on news that BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ticker was listed on DTCC. Again, the DTCC listing itself is a standard procedure and a routine step in ETF preparation, related to clearing and settlement services for ETFs, indicating that the infrastructure for potential trading is in place. Though the DTCC listing reflects a certain level of regulatory progress and readiness for trading, this, however, does not mean the ETF shares creation and redemption mechanisms have been set up by the DTCC. The SEC's approval of the ETFs is not contingent on the DTCC listing and the listing is not a direct factor that would influence the SEC's approval decision. Fidelity's Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust ETF also got a DTCC listing some days ago, under the ticker FBTC. Market Manipulation Concerns Could Linger Looking beyond the SEC's meetings with the ETF applicants, the listing of spot Bitcoin ETF tickers on DTCC, and the ongoing adjustments being made by applicants in their S-1 filings, it is imperative to emphasize the challenge of market manipulation, like wash trading , within the underlying asset, Bitcoin. This challenge remains a thorny issue that will take time to overcome. I believe that the level of market oversight sought by the SEC before greenlighting a spot Bitcoin ETF would take a gradual process to achieve. This, in my view, raises skepticism regarding the SEC's likelihood of expeditiously approving a spot Bitcoin ETF by January 5 - 10, 2024. The recent developments at Binance, with former CEO Changpeng Zhao stepping down and pleading guilty to criminal, could potentially reinforce the SEC's inclination to defer the approval of a Bitcoin ETF and raise apprehensions about the integrity of the crypto market. While the newly appointed CEO, Richard Teng, has expressed a commitment to collaborate with global regulators, it is worth noting that Binance Global is not a US-based exchange, and the exchange currently holds the largest share of the crypto and Bitcoin spot trade volume . Coordinating uniform regulatory standards across diverse jurisdictions is complex. New Updates to ETF Prospectuses In-Kind Redemption (BlackRock) In-Cash Redemption (BlackRock) In the ongoing dialogue with the SEC, spot Bitcoin ETF applicants are making strides in allaying the SEC's concerns regarding spot Bitcoin ETFs. Previous updates to the ETF filings have touched on issues like custody, and valuation, and contained certain risk disclosures. In a late November revision to its ETF application, BlackRock presented the Bitcoin ETF redemption workflows to the SEC, detailing the technical process of the spot Bitcoin ETF redemption using either the in-kind or in-cash redemption process. In the in-kind model, when retail investors redeem their ETF shares, they receive the equivalent value in Bitcoin directly from the ETF issuer, like Black Rock or Fidelity. Subsequently, investors can convert this Bitcoin into cash through a broker-dealer or other means. The in-kind model involves the direct transfer of the underlying asset (Bitcoin) during redemptions, allowing investors to receive ownership of the actual cryptocurrency. In the in-cash redemption model, when investors redeem their spot Bitcoin ETF shares, the ETF issuer would need to sell the Bitcoin from its holdings or cold storage, convert it into cash, and then provide the cash to the redeeming investors. BlackRock and other applicants favor the in-kind redemption model as it shields them from immediate BTC to cash conversion risks. Conversely, the SEC reportedly leans towards the in-cash redemption model. It's important to note that the SEC's preference for in-cash redemptions doesn't assure imminent approval. Expressing preferences is part of an ongoing regulatory dialogue between the SEC and applicants. Such preferences reflect discussions aimed at addressing regulatory concerns and aligning ETF structures with established standards. Revised In-Kind Redemption (BlackRock) BlackRock has subsequently proposed a revised version of the in-kind redemption model in its meeting with the SEC on November 28. The detailed workflows of the revised in-kind model can be found in this memo . Takeaway I'm more focused on the Bitcoin halving event, and I consider it the main catalyst for Bitcoin into the imminent bull season. Getting a spot in Bitcoin ETF approved by the next deadline stands at a 50-50 chance. If the ETFs don't get approved, there will likely be some serious price volatility and market shakeout in Q1. I'm maintaining a hold rating for BTC because my outlook is bullish for the long-term (at least post-halving event) irrespective of the likely short-term volatility. I believe that even if the ETFs do not get approved by their Q1 2024 deadlines, the dust (price volatility and price correction) will settle, and the subsequent reduction in block rewards and the post-halving market dynamics are poised to take effect. I'm skeptical about an ETF approval by Q1 and anticipate short-selling opportunities around the ETF dates.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4657708-bitcoin-short-term-volatility-looms?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/21351413.jpeg

Ethereum is also back above $2k, while smaller tokens play catch up to the mega caps, and just in time for the holidays too.  Ah, the rollercoaster that is the crypto market. It’s a wild ride that keeps us on our toes and glued to our screens, doesn’t it? Protocols and projects are forged and refined in the fire of market cyclicality, with lesser ideas falling the wayside or exiting through the dramatic jumps and falls of the market.  These cycles are rooted in some tangible factors that stem from a mix of demand dynamics driven by investor psychology, regulatory developments, and technological advancements meeting the supply demands of halving schedules, protocol forks and ICOs. When these factors align favorably, demand skyrockets causing prices to rocket higher, often fueled further by hype and the ubiquitous propellent known as FOMO (fear of missing out). That’s the halcyon days of the bull market where we bask in general euphoria, with the focus of fear being on further upside surprises.  You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  But with every cycle there is a duality, a yin for every yang. Enter the infamous ""crypto winter."" This icy period kicks in when sentiment gets overly bullish and investors excessively leveraged, resulting in a self-correcting market — prices plummet, investors panic, and the mood gets frostier than a New York winter bomb cyclone. Indicators of this chilling season? Prolonged price declines, increased market volatility, reduced trading volumes, and a general feeling of despair among investors who bought in during the hype and try to ignore the stress of unrealized losses.  So, where in this cycle are we now, and why are we waving goodbye to crypto winter and stepping into warmer times?  (Source: CoinDesk Indices)  Bitcoin’s up by a solid 18% month over month, while the broader CoinDesk Markets Index (CMI), which tracks the wider market, is up 21%. The outperformance of CMI over bitcoin shows the preference for lower cap altcoins, a positive cycle indicator due alongside positive Bitcoin and Ether Trend Indicator values and the buzz around spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) continues to heat up. We’re seeing a surge in inflows into crypto investment funds, and even meme-coins are making a comeback — yeah, they’re back in the game. Plus, the end of Sam Bankman-Fried’s trial gives the crypto world a fresh start.  Why are we out of the deep freeze? Well, it’s all about a shift in the narrative. Wall Street is entering the scene big time, talking billions in investments through ETFs. They’re spinning a tale of mainstream institutions swooping in to save the day, making crypto safer and more transparent for investors.  The focus now? More regulated crypto exchanges, building broader and more sustainable products like ETFs, tokenized securities, and stablecoins — not the frothy inside joke stuff of meme coins and overpriced NFTs we saw in the COVID frenzy.  This shift might ruffle some feathers, straying from crypto’s original ethos as an alternative to mainstream finance. But, hey, it’s what’s revving up excitement again. And it’s not just Wall Street driving this. Macro factors like the potential end of the U.S. interest rate hiking cycle, Middle East tensions and the specter of long-term inflation are nudging investors toward safer harbors, including crypto, as BlackRock’s Larry Fink’s “flight to quality,” comment suggested. Funny how a former crypto-skeptic like Fink is now singing Bitcoin’s praises on national TV, huh?  Assuming we’re now out of the deep crypto freeze, where are we in this new cycle? From an analysis of previous Bitcoin cycles using the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX), we can see that we could be well on our way to the next cycle highs.  From an average of previous cycles, it takes about 700 days between previous cycle lows and new cycle highs, with drawdowns averaging some -80% across cycles. Assuming November 21, 2022 was the previous cycle low, this would imply a new cycle high sometime in Q3 of 2024, with new highs exceeding previous cycle highs (November 9, 2021 was Bitcoin all-time-high of $67k) by a multiple of 2-7 times, assuming the averages of a small sample size of Bitcoin cycles hold and history repeats itself.  (Source: CoinDesk Indices)  Massive cycle analysis caveats aside, it appears that we’re out of another crypto winter, with the support of a broader institutional adoption narrative and a favorable macroeconomic backdrop.

Cardano Observed A Sudden Loss Of Wallets Prior To Rally As explained by Santiment in a post on X, ADA witnessed a large number of small wallets clear themselves out last month. The relevant indicator here is the “Supply Distribution,” which keeps track of the total amount of Cardano wallets that belong to the different groups in the market. The wallets or investors are categorized into these groups based on the number of tokens that they are carrying in their balance. For example, the 1 to 10 coins cohort includes all holders owning at least 1 and at most 10 ADA. Related Reading: Dogecoin Sell Signal Goes Off: Analyst Predicts Targets If the Supply Distribution is applied to this group, it would (among other things) total up the number of wallets satisfying this condition right now. In the context of the current discussion, Santiment has discussed about the Supply Distribution of two groups: 10 to 100 coins and 0 to infinity. The second one here is naturally a combination of all the wallet groups in existence, as there is no upper bound. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the indicator for these two Cardano groups over the last few months: Looks like both the metrics have observed a large plunge | Source: Santiment on X As displayed in the above graph, both of these Cardano groups observed a plunge in their wallet count back on November 17. In total, the addresses carrying some ADA balance dropped by almost 35,000 on this day. Generally, this kind of mass exit can be a bearish sign for the cryptocurrency, as it indicates a selloff is taking place. However, the finer details about which groups exactly have taken part in such selling can affect the outlook of the asset. Interestingly, as Santiment has noted, 98.1% of the wallets involved in the aforementioned selloff belonged to the small holders. This would suggest that the larger entities like the sharks and whales only saw a minimal amount of exit during this plunge. “A drop of addresses this size or smaller often indicates capitulation, and a potential price turning point,” explains the analytics firm. It would appear that the retail investors may have fallen prey to fear and sold off their holdings, which the big money investors potentially scooped up.

The move will benefit companies with crypto on their balance sheets, like MicroStrategy (MSTR). Under the existing rulebook, companies have to report a loss if the crypto they hold is worth less than the purchase price, even if they haven't sold the assets. Under the new rules, companies will have to report the fair value, cost-basis and types of assets they're holding.  Stakeholders providing feedback to FASB said the existing guidance did not provide useful information for investors or other parties, the update document said.  ""Accounting for only the decreases, but not the increases, in the value of crypto assets in the financial statements until they are sold does not provide relevant information that reflects (1) the underlying economics of those assets and (2) an entity’s financial position,"" the document said.  The new rules were adopted unanimously by the board and will take effect after Dec. 15, 2024, the document said.  A section explaining how FASB got to the point of adopting new guidance said it received a vast amount of feedback supporting a new approach to digital assets.  ""Stakeholders’ feedback, including respondents to the 2021 FASB Invitation to Comment (ITC), Agenda Consultation, indicated that improving the accounting for and disclosure of crypto assets should be a top priority for the Board,"" the document said.

42409250,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcF2Vw,1702483130,"S&P Faults Biggest Stablecoin, Tether's USDT, as It Debuts New Industry Ranking","Credit rating agency S&P reveals new stablecoin ranking system that gives the biggest one, Tether's $90 billion USDT, a poor score.  The system is designed to ""evaluate a stablecoin's ability to maintain a stable value relative to a fiat currency,"" which is the core job of a stablecoin.  Tether's $90 billion USDT, the world's largest stablecoin, was critiqued by S&P Global Ratings for being worse than rivals at doing its core task: being valued at $1.  S&P, famous for its long history in bond and credit ratings, just introduced a system for evaluating stablecoins, which serve as a key piece of the cryptocurrency ecosystem by acting as a bridge between crypto and the conventional financial system. They serve as a stand-in for traditional currencies like the U.S. dollar or euro, and are linked to a fiat currency. (USDT is pegged to $1, others are pegged to 1 euro, etc.) When investors cash out of crypto investments, they can receive that in the form of stablecoins, rather than fiat currencies, and stablecoins are also used as a form of digital payment.  The ratings agency's new Stablecoin Stability Assessment rates stablecoins on a 1 to 5 scale, aiming to ""evaluate a stablecoin's ability to maintain a stable value relative to a fiat currency,"" according to S&P. A score of 1 means a given stablecoin is ""very strong,"" while 5 means ""weak.""  Tether's USDT, the most popular stablecoin, got a score of 4 (meaning ""constrained""). The second-largest stablecoin, Circle Internet Financial's $24 billion USDC, got a 2 (""strong"") – the best rating any stablecoin got, an assessment it shared with Gemini dollar (GUSD) and Pax Dollar (USDP).  Stablecoin asset quality  ""The quality of the assets backing the stablecoin is a critical driver of the final assessment,"" S&P said in a statement introducing the system. ""Weaknesses in other areas, including regulation and supervision, governance, transparency, liquidity and redeemability, and track record, contributed to those stablecoins with lower assessments.""  Whether this assessment from a stalwart of traditional finance will steer investment decisions is an open question. For highly regulated TradFi firms, a group accustomed to listening to the likes of S&P, USDC is already a more transparent option than USDT, as it provides more information about the makeup of its reserves and published more frequent reports on its holdings.  On the other hand, users of USDT – and there are many – have already shown they don't really care by sticking with that stablecoin in the face of years of questions about the quality of the assets it holds to back USDT.  Read more: Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick Is a Bitcoin Maxi and Tether Fan  If there are $90 billion of USDT in circulation, then there should be the same amount of assets stashed in something – preferably a safe, stable asset like cash or the equivalent. It has never published an official audit, but does release quarterly ""attestations"" that describe the assets it holds. Tether said that at the end of the third quarter, it had $86 billion of assets ($72.6 billion of which were U.S. Treasuries, widely considered among the safest investments in the world) backed $83 billion worth of USDT.  Concerns were intensified when Tether and Bitfinex, its corporate sibling, agreed to pay $18.5 million in 2021 to settle allegations from New York state, which said: ""Tether's claims that its virtual currency was fully backed by U.S. dollars at all times was a lie.""  'Lack of regulation'  Of Tether and USDT, S&P wrote: ""Unlike some other issuers of stablecoins, Tether Ltd., which is incorporated in Hong Kong and wholly owned by British Virgin Islands-registered Tether Holdings Ltd., is not subject to regulation or supervision of an authoritative body. This contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), and are required to follow rules set by the NYDFS' stablecoin guidance. We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.""  None of the eight stablecoins that S&P evaluated scored a 1. In addition to USDT, Dai (DAI) and First Digital USD (FDUSD) also got 4s. The lowest rank of 5 was assigned to TrueUSD (TUSD) and Frax (FRAX).  ""As we look to the future, we see stablecoins becoming further embedded into the fabric of financial markets, acting as an important bridge between digital and real-world assets,"" Lapo Guadagnuolo, a senior analyst at S&P, said in a statement. ""Nonetheless, it's important to acknowledge that stablecoins are not immune to factors such as asset quality, governance, and liquidity.""  USDT is the third-biggest crypto after bitcoin [BTC] and ether [ETH], according to CoinGecko.  Several stablecoins depegged from their intended value in March, when a banking crisis gripped the U.S.  Circle's USDC sank to 87 cents, a harrowing moment for the crypto industry. Tether's USDT depegged, too, but not in the scary way S&P's report might imply was likely: It surged to $1.06 or so.  Read more: USDC Stablecoin Depegs, Crypto Market Goes Haywire After Silicon Valley Bank Collapses  Last month, the Bank for International Settlements – the global organization of central banks – said that most stablecoins have not managed to stay stable. To serve as a medium of exchange, stability is essential, the bank said. The BIS cited concerns over ""transparency regarding the availability and quality of these reserves,"" an issue echoed by S&P.  Tether had not responded to a request for comment by publication time.

42409258,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcF2wO,1702481994,"Argentina's Milei, So Far Shunning Bitcoin, Devalues Peso by More Than 50%","Argentina's recently elected president devalued the nation's currency by more than 50% and announced spending cuts, but, possibly to the dismay of cryptocurrency enthusiasts, Javier Milei did not – yet, at least – turn his enthusiasm for bitcoin [BTC] into an official government policy.  In slashing the peso's value to 800 per U.S. dollar from less than 400, Milei is mostly bringing the government's official valuation in line with that of private markets, where the peso lately has often traded at more than 1,000 to the dollar. Notably, though, the Milei administration has done nothing to lift the capital controls imposed by the previous government that allowed it to cap the official rate at about 400.  Among the moves to lower government spending, the administration announced that contracts of less than a year will not be renewed, reduced subsidies for public transportation, electricity, gas and water, and canceled government advertising for one year.

The IMF praise is sure to raise the antennae of bitcoin fans who hoped the libertarian Milei might prove friendly to BTC and perhaps even go as far as pushing to make it legal tender in that country.

It’s still unclear how restrictive the new laws might be, but it hasn’t spooked adoption even at the institutional level. This week, two of Turkey’s largest banking groups announced crypto initiatives.  On Monday, the investment arm of Akbank announced it had acquired local crypto firm Stablex, with a top official at Ak Investment saying the group wanted to be a key player in the digital asset space.  Garanti BBVA, another leading bank, launched its crypto wallet app the following day. The application has a cold wallet feature and allows users to send and receive assets like bitcoin [BTC], USD Coin [USDC] and ether [ETH].  Turkey ranks among the top 20 countries in Chainalysis' Global Crypto Adoption Index 2023. The country also hosted Ethereum conference Devconnect this year.  However, the government has not been a fan of unchecked adoption. In 2021, the country’s central bank prohibited the use of crypto for payments, although officials ruled out a total ban on digital assets.  In November, a government official said crypto legislation will soon come to Parliament.

The company has operational capacity in three locations, with access to low-cost, fixed-price power, setting it up for profits at higher Bitcoin prices. CIFR plans to expand its operations and increase its capacity, but its valuation is relatively expensive compared to other alternatives in the sector. I believe CIFR could be a good buy on dips, but I deem it a ""hold"" at these levels. Cipher Mining Inc. (CIFR) is a company that specializes in developing and operating Bitcoin mining data centers. CIFR's operations are based in Texas, fueled by low-cost fixed-price power. As the cryptocurrency market is bracing for the halving's shake-up, CIFR's strategy is to acquire assets at cyclical lows, maximize the use of power using efficient mining equipment and cost-effective power sources, optimize trading with participation in the energy market, and improve production pre-halving. My valuation: A Mining Operation: Business Overview Cipher Mining is a company that runs Bitcoin mining data centers in three locations in Texas: Odessa, Alborz, and Bear and Chief facilities located near Andrews. These data centers have operation capacity of 207 MW, 40 MW, and 20 MW, respectively. The number of mining bitcoins YTD through October 2023 is 3,531 in Odessa with an average electricity cost per Bitcoin of $8,390, 603 in Alborz with an electricity cost per Bitcoin of $6,794, and 421 in Bear and Chief facilities with an electricity cost per Bitcoin of $10,448. Approximately 96% of the CIFR's facilities use low-cost, fixed-price power. The CIFR operational efficiency is based on the low cost in the industry at roughly $0.027 per kilowatt hour. Naturally, electricity costs aren't the only variables pertinent from a business perspective, but evidently, CIFR has access to cheap electricity, which sets it up for profits at higher Bitcoin prices. In November 2023, CIFR completed the Odessa data center, leading to a hash rate capacity of 7.2 exahash per second [EH/s]. Moreover, the company signed an agreement to buy a new site in Texas with the approval of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas [ERCOT]. ERCOT schedules power distribution and manages the energy market in Texas. The new facility, Black Pearl , is expected to be functioning by 2025 with 300 MW of energy. The monthly sale of Bitcoin covers CIFR's operating expenses and CapEx. They aim to build their bitcoin inventory with the surplus while investing in growing its infrastructure. Additionally, CIFR can sell back electricity to the grid on the Odessa site, and they report it as a Bitcoin equivalent. CIFR invested in 1.2 EH/s of S21 rigs to be delivered in the first half of 2024. The Odessa facility achieved a high site hash rate of 6.24 EH/s . The company plans to expand its operations and increase its capacity to 23.5 EH/s by the end of 2025. CIFR's acquisition of computational power at a competitive price will improve its efficiency and Bitcoin mining output, which is essential, especially near the halving that will reduce the block reward from 6.25 to 3.125 Bitcoins. Source: Cipher Mining Business Update Presentation, November 2023. The next halving will be in April 2024, and it will affect a company like CIFR due to the reduced revenue per block and the intensification of competition because each miner will try to be more efficient. In the last halving, the Bitcoin price rose to a maximum of a year or a year and a half after. This price increase counteracts the negative effect of the diminishing block reward. However, the CIFR position will depend on its efficiency and market condition. On the other hand, the impact of the next halving remains to be seen and may differ from previous ones because the current economic circumstances are different from those in the last halving. Halvings are huge events in crypto, and their consequences are highly unpredictable. The generally accepted view is that halvings reduce the Bitcoin mining rewards by half, reducing the selling pressure on Bitcoin. As a result, the price rises after halvings due to the lower supply, which has been the case historically . However, from a mining perspective, there's a lag between the price increase and the immediate rewards being cut in half. This period creates uncertainty for miners as they have to perform the same amount of work for half the pay, and relying on prices doubling to make up for the reduced rewards is inherently speculative. Moreover, Bitcoin's hashing rate has consistently trended higher over time, meaning miners must keep up with their processing power or see significant losses. CIFR's Solid Cash Flow and Crypto Shifts In the Q3 2023 Earnings Call, the CIFR executives were pleased with the performance during the first full summer operating in Texas despite the challenging environment with record heat and power reduction by the provider they achieved to optimize the performance. Heat is a big factor for mining companies as computers and processors wear down quickly due to heat. Generally speaking, the warmer the environment, the faster the equipment will wear down. This is why mining companies tend to prefer colder locations because the heat generated from mining is offset by the room temperature, prolonging the useful life of the mining equipment. So it's promising to see that despite the recent hot weather, CIFR managed to perform satisfactorily. Moreover, Q3 2023 was solid related to cash flow and liquidity. The Odessa site was fully running and generated $30.3 million for the three months ending September 30, 2023. The cost of revenue was $13 million due to power costs. Additionally, they reported sales of power at $2.7 million. Source: Cipher Mining Business Update Presentation, November 2023. Furthermore, from August to October 2023, some events had an incidence in the Bitcoin market, its price, and its hash rate. On August 29, Grayscale won an SEC lawsuit for its Bitcoin [ETF] review. Grayscale aims to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust [GBTC] into a listed Bitcoin exchange-traded fund ETF. Theoretically, if GBTC converts into an ETF, it'd unlock its Bitcoin at market prices. This is potentially a big event as GBTC holders would quickly realize the discount to NAV, which currently stands at around 13.71% . This means that this particular discount to NAV is also an indicator of the likelihood of the ETF conversion being approved. The lower the discount, the higher the possibility, as the market judges. It's generally accepted that a Bitcoin ETF would create a seamless investment vehicle for investors in traditional markets, bringing additional demand for Bitcoin and supporting higher prices. Accordingly, on September 28, the deadline for Bitcoin ETF approval was delayed to early 2024. On September 22, the Financial Accounting Standards Board [FASB] ruled on digital assets with guidelines for companies to account for cryptocurrencies on their financial reports. These guidelines can build confidence in investors, bringing transparency to how these assets are measured in financial statements. This ruling also gives regulatory legitimacy to crypto assets. Finally, the hash rate grew due to the increment of computational power with the development of new technologies. These positive developments paint a potential turning point for the crypto markets after a dismal crash in 2022 . Analysts expect CIFR to generate roughly $141.7 million in revenues in 2024. (Seeking Alpha.) Still Expensive: Valuation Analysis From a valuation perspective, one of the most telling slides from CIFR's investor presentation was their Bitcoin-mined target. They claim that pre-halving, they can mine 14.9 Bitcoins per day. We can infer that post-halving, they'll likely mine half of that, or 7.45 Bitcoin daily. We don't know what will be the Bitcoin price by then, but if we assume that Bitcoin rises to $50,000 in the long run after this halving as it has done in previous halvings, then that'd imply a daily revenue run rate of $372,500, or roughly $136.0 million. CIFR trades at a $629.8 million market cap , implying a 4.63 P/S ratio. This is relatively expensive as the sector's median P/S ratio is about 2.82, or roughly half of CIFR's multiple. Naturally, if Bitcoin rises much above $50,000, this valuation multiple would improve proportionally, though that ventures into highly speculative territory. In my view, CIFR trades at a high multiple, and given that there are other alternatives in the sector at better valuation multiples, I think that makes CIFR a ""hold"" for now. Despite CIFR's recent pullback, it trades at a relatively high multiple. (TradingView.) Conclusion Overall, CIFR is a relatively simple business with its Bitcoin mining operation. There's nothing particularly special about the firm other than its high-potential EH/s. In the long run, bitcoin mining companies should do well if Bitcoin continues to increase in price. However, if the price remains relatively stable or stagnates over many years, the hashing rate required to mine Bitcoin and the Bitcoin reward itself will pressure CIFR's business over time. Thus, this is why I believe it's vital to invest in miners only at highly favorable valuation multiples, and currently, CIFR seems rather expensive. Therefore, I believe CIFR is a ""hold"" for now.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4657682-cipher-mining-remains-relatively-expensive?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/21349660.jpeg

42409254,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcF2t5,1702478168,First Mover Americas: Revised BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Filing Invites Participation From U.S. Banks,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  A change to the mechanics of BlackRock's proposed spot bitcoin (BTC) ETF opens the door for Wall Street banks, which face restrictions holding cryptocurrencies, to play a key role. BlackRock recently made it so authorized participants (APs) – a vital part of the ETF ecosystem – will be able to create new fund shares with cash, rather than only with cryptocurrency. As highly regulated U.S. banks are unable to hold bitcoin themselves, this set-up would enable the likes of JPMorgan or Goldman Sachs – firms with some of the largest balance sheets in the world – to act as APs to BlackRock's ETF. (Whether they want to is another matter.) The cash APs use in this process can then be exchanged into bitcoin by an intermediary and warehoused by the ETF's custody provider, as per a memo filing relating to a Nov. 28 meeting involving the Securities and Exchange Commission, BlackRock and Nasdaq.  Binance, Binance.US and Changpeng Zhao argued that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) did not meet the requirements of the “Howey Test” in its suit against the two companies and their founder in a new filing Tuesday. Binance and Zhao filed a reply to the SEC alongside Binance.US, which submitted its own separate but similar filing arguing the SEC did not show that the exchanges’ U.S. customers had any contracts that would meet the definition of an “investment contract,” or that other elements of the Supreme Court case were met. It’s the latest bid to dismiss the lawsuit filed by the federal regulator in June, when the SEC alleged that Binance and Binance.US allowed the general public to buy and trade unregistered securities by listing certain cryptocurrencies and offering a staking service.  Crypto mogul Justin Sun has said that assets held on HTX and Poloniex are “100% safe” after last month’s hack that saw more than $200 million siphoned out of the exchanges.  Both exchanges have opened withdrawals for certain assets, although several altcoins remain locked. Bitcoin (BTC) and Tron (TRX) are the two digital assets that can be withdrawn. This led to both tokens trading at a premium on Poloniex over the past few weeks, which meant users would have to take a haircut of up to 10% to liquidate their asset and withdraw another.  The freeze came after hackers stole $114 million out of Poloniex’s hot wallets on Nov. 10; this was followed up by $97 million being stolen from HTX and blockchain protocol Heco Chain.

This time around, it is large holders who are driving the bullish return. Specifically, these large holders have increased their positive net flows by more than 10x. Shiba Inu Large Holder Netflow Jumps 1079% According to the on-chain data tracker IntoTheBlock, the Shiba Inu large holder net flow has seen a significant rise. These large wallets saw their net flow ( the total difference between inflows and outflows) rise an outstanding 1079% starting from December 10. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Cardano Price Will Rise 6000% To $33, Here’s The Timeline In total, the net flow of these large wallets came out to a whopping 4.68 trillion SHIB. Now, this is important when placed in comparison to the numbers from the previous days which the tracker shows to be just under the 287 billion SHIB mark. A logical explanation for this massive uptick in net flows is that these whales are looking to take advantage of the low SHIB prices. On December 10, the SHIB price was still trading above $0.00001, which is when the net flows were under 287 billion. However, as the SHIB price began to drop, the net flows of these large accounts began to rise. The further the price dropped, the more the whales added to their wallets. This shows a clear intent to accumulate tokens with the belief that the price is poised to bounce back again. SHIB price falls below $0.00001 | Source: SHIBUSD on Tradingview.com SHIB Investor Sentiment Turning Bullish The decline in price has understandably eroded investors’ bullishness to a certain degree. But this seems to be short-lived especially as metrics begin to turn toward the upside. The first of these is the SHIB burn rate seeing an uptick in the last day. Related Reading: XRP Price Prediction: Crypto Analyst Expects 200% Jump As Critical Support Forms Data from Shibburn highlights a 49% increase in the burn rate of the meme coin over the last 24 hours. This comes as a total of 2.88 billion tokens were burned by the community at this time. Usually, this happens as investors expect a turning point in the price. Additionally, the Shiba Inu Fear & Greed Index has also managed to maintain a neutral level. This suggests that there is still a good level of bullishness left after the price decline. As long as metrics continue to improve, there could be a turnback toward recovery soon.

42409248,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcF2cY,1702476000,Sam Altman Is Bringing Worldcoin's Controversial Eye-Scanning Orb to Reddit and Microsoft,"Worldcoin, the crypto startup co-founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, announced a major expansion to its eye-scanning identity platform on Wednesday, including integrations with major tech firms and a new multi-level verification system for the World ID ""digital passport.""  Tiago Sada, the head of product at Tools for Humanity, the company behind Worldcoin, said in an interview that World ID 2.0 marks a ""monumental upgrade"" for the protocol that combines ""ideas that were originally laid on the white paper"" with ""feedback that we've heard from developers.""  This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. Also please check out our weekly The Protocol podcast.  Sada said Worldcoin will begin offering on-site onboarding into its proof-of-personhood service in Singapore and Mexico. Additionally, he said the protocol has added integrations with Shopify, Mercado Libre, Reddit, Telegram, and Microsoft's Minecraft among others. The integrations could eventually enable some users to log in to these services using a World ID.  The 2.0 upgrade will help these companies by making it ""easier to distinguish between bots and verified humans online,"" Tools for Humanity said in an emailed statement.  An eyeball-scanning orb  It's impossible to talk about Worldcoin without mentioning the orb – the retina-scanning sphere that one must peer into in exchange for a World ID passport. A basketball-sized chrome globe, the device scans eyeballs to authenticate first-time users. It does this to guarantee that all World ID-holders are verifiably unique, which could prove useful for online services looking to suss out bots from real humans in the increasingly uncanny age of AI.  The eerie intimacy of Worldcoin's chosen authentication method has sparked concerns about user privacy: For a vocal corner of the privacy-obsessed, anti-corporate blockchain industry, the idea of handing one's biometric data to a shiny metallic orb built by a Silicon Valley startup has inevitably rung dystopian.  But Tools for Humanity says Worldcoin doesn't save its eye scans and only uses them for first-time authentication of users. Tools for Humanity also pitches the World ID service as a more privacy-preserving alternative to traditional authentication systems. World ID holders can ""verify to an app or service that they are human without disclosing their identity,"" Tools for Humanity said in its statement.  On Reddit, for example, the moderators of a subreddit can use World ID to ""give people that have been verified as humans specific roles or special permissions,"" said Sada. Or on Shopify, merchants that give out discount codes can use World ID to ""make sure that you only get that discount once,"" he added.  With World ID 2.0, ""new verification levels"" have been added to accommodate users who opt to give different amounts of verification data. In addition to the standard orb-based World ID, a new base-level World ID forgoes the retina scans and allows users to authenticate themselves on their own devices. This lower verification tier can help expand IDs to people without access to an orb authentication site, and it can be used to sign into apps with less stringent proof-of-personhood requirements.  On the opposite end of the verification spectrum will be another new – and stricter – tier called Orb Plus. App-makers can identify users using this option if they want orb-authenticated users to re-verify themselves on-device each time they sign in with a World ID.  Altman's OpenAI ouster  Tools for Humanity says ""nearly five million people"" have scanned their eyes in exchange for World IDs since Sam Altman unveiled the orb in 2021. The number ""includes more than 1% of the population of Chile, 1% of the population of Argentina, and more than 2% of the population of Portugal,"" said Sada. Worldcoin's main product today is a crypto wallet app that anyone can use, and which offers special access to verified ID-holders.  Sada says Altman remains actively engaged in major product and strategy decisions at Worldcoin, and he claims he learned of the AI luminary's surprise firing and rehiring from OpenAI on the news like everyone else.  That debacle sparked public speculation around Altman's commitment to AI safety – one of the founding principles upon which OpenAI and Worldcoin were both founded. ""Sam has clearly been at the middle of the spectrum"" between techno-optimism, which seeks to accelerate the development of technology like AI, and effective altruism, which is more concerned with AI's existential risks, remarked Sada. ""If anything, he's more on the safety side.""  ""Worldcoin was started because the world is changing, and we need the tools to make the most of this new era,"" said Sada.  Correction (Dec. 13, 16:56 UTC): The companies that have integrated World ID are not ""partners,"" as originally written.

The bitcoin infrastructure firm raised $5.075 million for its Blockstream ASIC (BASIC) note Series 1 in September, of which it will allocate $4.876 million to acquire Antminer S19k Pro ASIC mining machines.  The target for Series 2 is as yet undisclosed, according to a Blockstream spokesman.  Blockstream is aiming to capitalize on ""historically low prices"" for mining hardware ahead of 2024's bitcoin halving, according to an emailed announcement on Wednesday.  BASIC is a bitcoin-denominated investment vehicle to accrue gains from the price of ASIC mining equipment, which Blockstream anticipates will rise post-halving.  A pitch for the notes describes the investment strategy like this: ""Leveraging Blockstream's long track record, leading market position, substantial scale, broad expertise and strong relationships across the ASIC supply chain, the BASIC structure plans to acquire and warehouse new and unused ASICs at attractive prices, and to eventually strategically sell them back into the market as the industry rebounds within the next 12-24 months.""

Both exchanges have opened withdrawals for certain assets, although several altcoins remain locked. Bitcoin [BTC] and Tron [TRX] are the two digital assets that could be withdrawn; this led to both tokens trading at a premium on Poloniex over the past few weeks, which meant users would have to take a haircut of up to 10% to liquidate their asset and withdraw another.  The withdrawal freeze came after hackers stole $114 million out of Poloniex’s hot wallets on Nov. 10; this was followed up by $97 million being stolen from HTX and blockchain protocol Heco Chain.  “Right now, Poloniex and HTX have recovered from the hack, and we are resuming the tokens one by one,” Justin Sun, an investor in Poloniex and an advisor for HTX, told CoinDesk. “I think for HTX, we have already resumed 95% in terms of USD worth of assets. On Poloniex, we have resumed around 85% in terms of the USD value of the assets.”  “And also be aware, since we have already covered all of the loss of tokens in the platform, on HTX and Poloniex, 100% of assets are 100% safe,” Sun added. “Even though in terms of exchanges itself, we need to basically earn those profits in the future. But for customer assets, it’s 100% safe.”  An HTX spokesperson told CoinDesk, “The recent outflow represents a small fraction of our total reserves, and HTX remains in stable, healthy operation.”  To remedy the fears of users holding funds on both exchanges, HTX and Poloniex have announced an airdrop valued at $1 worth of tether [USDT]. A snapshot will be taken, and users will receive one airdropped token for every U.S. dollar worth of tokens they hold on the exchange.  HTX has facilitated $1.6 billion in trading volume over the past 24 hours; Poloniex, meanwhile, has racked up $843 million, according to CoinMarketCap.  Justin Sun became a significant player in the crypto industry when he founded the Tron blockchain, which raised $70 million in a 2017 initial coin offering (ICO). Tron is now the 11th largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $9.1 billion; it is also the second largest blockchain in volume, with $7.9 billion in total value locked (TVL).  Sun’s rise to success with Tron came alongside regulatory scrutiny; the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against Sun, alleging that TRX was a security earlier this year. Sun’s legal team was granted an extension to respond to that lawsuit earlier this week, according to court documents obtained by CoinDesk.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Oliver Knight,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/12/13/htx-poloniex-assets-are-100-safe-says-justin-sun-after-200m-hack,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2dee615715bcf7e043922f7a5f98cf3224106ff6-1353x761.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The world’s largest crypto has had incredible growth this year, with a special surge starting in the middle of October. However, after hitting a yearly high of $44,500 on December 8, the price of Bitcoin has pulled back about 6% as some investors look to be taking profits. According to on-chain data provider Glassnode, several of its on-chain pricing models suggest Bitcoin’s fair value is currently between $30,000 and $36,000. Bitcoin’s Price Rally Pauses As After A Resistance At $44,500 Bitcoin’s price appreciation this year led to a 150% gain which pushed it above $44,500, but on-chain data shows the hot streak has cooled off a bit after forming a resistance at this price level. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Rally To $0.0001? Shibarium Transaction Count Breaches 90 Million Milestone This has led to many short-term investors taking profit from their holdings. According to data from Whale Alerts, there have also been various instances of large BTC transactions into crypto exchanges in the past few days, suggesting some whale addresses might also be participating in the selloff. 🚨 🚨 658 #BTC (26,893,152 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to #Binancehttps://t.co/QzyF0MRiHT — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) December 13, 2023 A short-term correction was inevitable, according to crypto data firm Glassnode’s fair value models. Their analysis based on the investor cost basis and network throughput suggests the fair price is lagging behind the current market spike. A metric cited was the Active Investor Realized Price, which monitors the degree of HODLing across the network. According to this model, Bitcoin’s spot prices are currently trading above its realized price (fair value). Taking a look at historical trends shows it has taken between 14 to 20 months between the realized price and the creation of an all-time high. The path to the creation of a new ATH has also always involved major spot price fluctuations of ±50% around the Active Investors Realized Price. Source: Glassnode The crypto asset is now 11 months into the break, with spot prices fluctuating between -38% and 21% of the realized price. If history repeats itself, we could see another few months of movements around the current fair value of $36,000. This price point correlates with a social media post by crypto analyst Ali Martinez. While noting IntoTheBlock data, the analyst noted strong support between $37,150 and $38,360, backed by 1.52 million addresses holding 534,000 BTC. In case of a deeper correction, #Bitcoin finds solid support between $37,150 and $38,360. This zone is backed by 1.52 million addresses holding 534,000 $BTC. Also, watch out for two resistance walls that could keep the #BTC uptrend at bay: one at $43,850 and another at $46,400. pic.twitter.com/NGm1XpMOLf — Ali (@ali_charts) December 11, 2023 BTC bulls try to recover losses | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com Another technical pricing model cited by Glassnode was the Mayer Multiple. The Mayer Multiple indicator is now at a value of 1.47, close to the 1.5 level which often forms a level of resistance in prior bull cycles. Related Reading: Crypto Expert Explains Why The Bitcoin Price Crash To $40,000 Is Not A Bad Thing Glassnode’s report also looked at various other pricing models, including the NVT Premium indicator which evaluates the utility of the network throughput in terms of a USD value. According to the NVT Premium, the recent rally is one of the biggest spikes since Bitcoin’s all-time high in November 2021, suggesting an overvaluation in relation to the network throughput. What’s Next For Bitcoin? Bitcoin is trading at $40,963 at the time of writing. Although the crypto is now down by 6% in a 7-day timeframe, it is still monitoring gains of 8.5% from its December open of $37,731. The $44,500 level is now a crucial level for the asset, as the industry continues to wait for a bullish run after the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US. The crypto market is still in bullish sentiment, with Coinmarket’s Fear & Greed Index pointing to a 73 greed. A power through $44,500 would signal the resumption of the bullish trend for Bitcoin. Another resistance level to watch after the break would be the $46,400 level.

While most prominent gaming tokens have followed suit, experiencing a decrease in value since late Sunday, this pattern highlights the interconnected nature of digital assets. Despite market volatility, the IMX token fights the downward pressure and continues its previous upward trajectory, demonstrating a unique resilience and potential decoupling from cryptocurrency correlation. Related Reading: Injective (INJ) Trains Guns On $30 After Hitting An All-Time High Of $27 – Details Immutable’s IMX Hits $2 Milestone The trajectory of Immutable’s IMX token has been characterized by a rapid and substantial increase in value since October. This upward movement reached its zenith today, as the IMX token breached past the key $2 level. At the time of writing, IMX was trading at $2.01, up 42% in the last seven days, data from CoinMarketCap shows. Such a peak represents a significant milestone for the token, as it marks a level that had not been reached since April 2022. This extended duration underscores the significance of the current price surge, suggesting a notable departure from the historical price trends of the IMX token. IMX seven-day price action. Source: CoinMarketCap With a market valuation of more than $2.8 billion, Immutable X is one of the largest layer-2 networks globally. It is a network that is essential to the non-fungible token (NFT) and gaming industries. The organization has collaborated with some of the major names in the gaming sector in the last few years. Companies like Merit Circle, Illuvium, Unity, Ubisoft, and StarkWare are a few of the most renowned partners. In an effort to transform gaming on Beam in the future, the network has partnered with Merit Circle DAO and GameStop, two of the biggest American retailers. IMX market cap currently at $2.599 billion. Chart: TradingView.com In order to establish Transak as the “principal payments partner” for Immutable Checkout on the zkEVM network, Immutable established a new partnership with the payments processor on Monday. Because of Immutable X’s low transaction costs, Ethereum-grade security, speedy transaction rates, and user-friendliness, developers adore it. Additionally, it contains all the tools required by developers to create scalable games, including Orderbook, Marketplace, Checkout, and Passport. IMX Price Prediction With 18 of the 30 (or 60%) green days and 11.72% price volatility over the past 30 days, Immutable X is still attracting the interest of investors. Likewise, Immutable’s future appears bright as 27 technical indicators are glowing green. IMX price forecast. Source: Coincodex The CoinMarketCap ranking of the IMX token has increased to 29th. The spike is in reaction to VanEck’s claim that the introduction of new blockchain-based video games, such Illuvium, which is due out next year, may raise the value of the IMX token. Immutable has also been trying to fix many of the technological pain points that have hampered the success of Web3 gaming thus far, according to VanEck. Meanwhile, Coincodex’s current Immutable price prediction indicates that this week’s price of Immutable will fall by -7.18% to $ 0.003929.

However, it appears that the market is currently in a phase of rest and consolidation, with investors cautiously hopeful yet reluctant to drive prices much higher at the moment. The overall trading activity has decreased from its recent peak, leading to a reduction in market volatility. Despite this, the price of INJ has experienced a 12% increase in the last day, currently trading at $25. Related Reading: Bitcoin Speed Bump: A Week’s Surge Crumbles In Just 20 Minutes Injective Inks 50% Price Rally One of the things to consider as the token searches for more growth is what has propelled it to a record high. So, is there a chance that this rally will last, or will bears ruin the bulls’ Yuletide celebration? Injective’s native token has experienced a price explosion of over 50% in the previous 30 days, and the steady climb since the lows hit in December 2022 has featured a parabolic rise of over 1,500%. Positive news about the ecosystem and the general bullish mood have driven INJ higher in recent weeks. INJ seven-day price action. Source: Coingecko Just the last day saw a 40% spike in INJ’s trading volume to $508 million. The price of INJ has fluctuated by around 15% during the last day, indicating high intraday volatility as well. Traders need to get ready for further volatility in the near future. Related Reading: Hold Your Horses: Bitcoin Could Fall Back To Under $38,000, These Analysts Say Now that Injective has a new ATH set, it is in unexplored terrain and might rise swiftly. INJ currently has a market cap of $2.07 billion. Source: TradingView.com In the event of a decline, the nearest area of support is at $24, and then $20, which corresponds to the Fibonacci 0.382 retracement level. Just below that, at $16 and $15, respectively, you can find support at the 0.5 and 0.618 Fib levels. If INJ’s rally hits a wall, the stock might retrace to these levels before continuing its ascent. INJ’s $65K Burn Boosts Weekly Surge Injective’s weekly token burn has been one of the major triggers for the previous few days. The most recent of these saw the burning of over $65,000 worth of INJ, eliminating them from circulation forever. Injective saw a notable increase in the total amount of INJ staked during the burn auction. There have been almost $1 billion worth of tokens staked thus far, based on on-chain data. A bullish continuation might see buyers target prices above $30. A bearish turn in tandem with a wider market decline may signal a possible decline to $20–$18 range support.

21334157,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=565113,1702440028,Is Trader Joe (JOE) A Hidden Gem Poised to Outperform Uniswap (UNI)?,"In decentralized finance (DeFi) and trading, Uniswap has long reigned as a dominant force. However, a recent analysis by Lark Davis, a Bitcoin (BTC) investor, seems to suggest Trader Joe, a decentralized exchange (DEX) on Avalanche–a highly scalable blockchain and Ethereum’s competitor, could eventually emerge as a formidable competitor, even overtaking Uniswap. Is Trader Joe Undervalued Relative To Uniswap? In a post on X on December 12, Davis noted a discrepancy in the relative valuation between JOE and UNI, which serve as governance tokens of Uniswap and Trader Joe. Specifically, the investors noted that Trader Joe’s handles around $300 million daily trading volume on Avalanche alone. On the other hand, Uniswap processes approximately $1.6 billion in daily volume across the Ethereum mainnet and Arbitrum, the largest layer-2 platform by total value locked (TVL) by Ethereum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Speed Bump: A Week’s Surge Crumbles In Just 20 Minutes Davis further noted that despite this “small” difference in trading volume, Trader Joe’s has a market capitalization of only $238 million. Meanwhile, Uniswap has a market cap of $3.6 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data. Even with relatively narrow average trading volume, the huge difference in market capitalization suggests that JOE is significantly undervalued relative to UNI. Accordingly, this gap will likely be narrowed in the future, with JOE appreciating versus UNI, possibly benefiting holders. JOE Yields Versus UNI’s Governance: Which Token Has An Edge? Davis also pointed out JOE’s potential, saying the token rewards holders with USDC yields. This is different from UNI, where holders can vote on proposals and nothing else. In the investor’s preview, besides the undervaluation, this feature could further enhance JOE’s appeal, even contributing to its upside potential. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Cardano Price Will Rise 6000% To $33, Here’s The Timeline As the crypto market recovers, Avalanche might also present additional advantages to traders and, therefore, Trader Joe. The modern blockchain is scalable and has relatively low fees regardless of network activity. With crypto prices expanding, Ethereum gas fees have been rising in tandem, discouraging mainnet transfers. This has rerouted activity to layer-2s like Arbitrum and competing platforms, including Avalanche.

Binance and Zhao, more commonly known as “CZ,” filed a reply to the SEC alongside Binance.US, which submitted its own separate but similar filing arguing that the SEC did not show that the exchanges’ U.S. customers had any contracts that would meet the definition of an “investment contract,” or that other elements of the Supreme Court case were met.  It’s the latest bid to dismiss the lawsuit filed by the federal regulator in June when the SEC alleged that Binance and Binance.US allowed the general public to buy and trade unregistered securities by listing certain cryptocurrencies and offering a staking service.  Binance, which recently settled different charges with the U.S. Department of Justice, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Office of Foreign Asset Control and Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, filed to dismiss the SEC lawsuit in September, arguing the regulator was overreaching its authority (it made a similar argument in a filing to dismiss a CFTC suit in July).  In Tuesday’s filings – which are responding to the SEC’s own reply to the motion to dismiss – both Binance and Binance.US argued that the regulator hadn’t shown there were any obligations to the exchange’s users after they purchased certain cryptocurrencies, suggesting there was no investment contract as needed by the Howey Test.  DOJ settlement  Binance also pushed back against the SEC, adding the exchange’s guilty plea with the DOJ and consent order with FinCEN, or Zhao’s own DOJ plea, in the ongoing case.  The SEC argued that the settlements showed that Binance was well aware it was operating in the U.S., serving U.S. customers and otherwise tapping infrastructure within the U.S. for transactions.  “Zhao’s and Binance’s plea agreements and the Consent Order provide further grounds for this Court to deny the Joint Motion [to Dismiss],” the SEC said.  In another Tuesday filing, Binance argued that securities laws wouldn’t apply like the Bank Secrecy Act or International Emergency Economic Powers Act (two laws governing the charges Binance and Zhao settled) did.  “Jurisdictional admissions under the BSA do not bring any of the SEC’s claims within the reach of the securities laws,” Binance and Zhao claimed.  The filing also argued that the settlements and consent order didn’t implicate securities laws.  “That facts in the plea agreements with the Department of Justice show that BHL and Mr. Zhao violated the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) does not say anything about whether there was fair notice of the SEC’s theory that the crypto assets at issue were securities under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act,” the filing said.",NEUTRAL,없음,COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | BNB,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/12/13/sec-hasnt-met-legal-requirements-to-sue-binance-says-in-latest-bid-to-dismiss-lawsuit,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3bb493ad5430f73912182503114c7ab3aceba601-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

21332896,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=565109,1702436438,Token Spotlight And Next Run Predictions: Analyst’s Weekly Altcoins Watchlist Unveiled,"Cryptocurrency analyst Miles Deutscher has provided insights into potential altcoin opportunities as the crypto market experiences a sharp correction and many altcoins consolidate after recent gains. Deutscher’s analysis focuses on several altcoins that he believes could be poised for significant upside movement. BTC, AVAX, And INJ Stand Out Amid Market Correction Bitcoin (BTC), although not an altcoin but the largest cryptocurrency on the market, is one of the coins Deutscher mentions, noting that it is currently retesting the break of an ascending channel on the daily chart. Deutscher suggests that the recent market correction was necessary to flush out over-leveraged positions and sees the price action as reminiscent of previous bull market environments. Related Reading: Bitcoin Speed Bump: A Week’s Surge Crumbles In Just 20 Minutes Another altcoin that Deutscher highlights is Avalanche (AVAX), which he describes as one of the clear altcoin leaders. Despite the market downturn, AVAX quickly recovered from the dip, and Deutscher expects further continuation. However, the analyst points out that the risk-reward ratio for AVAX is diminishing, and suggests considering other rotation plays that have not experienced a significant price appreciation. Injective Protocol (INJ) is another standout performer mentioned by Deutscher. Despite the broader altcoin market downturn, INJ has remained in the green, showing a 17% increase over the past 24 hours. Deutscher praises INJ’s performance over the past few weeks and suggests accumulating on major pullbacks. Deutscher also draws attention to Celestia (TIA), a coin that has displayed resilience during the recent market correction. The analyst notes the strong “Solestia” narrative surrounding TIA, with several significant projects set to launch soon, indicating potential insider interest. Immutable X (IMX) is highlighted as a leading altcoin in the gaming sector. Deutscher mentions its push towards the next resistance level at $2.60 and emphasizes its strong fundamentals, with over 400 games launching on the platform. PrimeDAO (PRIME) is one of Deutscher’s top gaming picks. The popularity of their game, Parallel, is growing, and the upcoming Coinbase listing for retail traders is viewed as a significant catalyst. Deutscher suggests that PRIME is currently in price discovery mode, and further upward movement would not be surprising. Undervalued Altcoins To Watch Moving on to altcoins that have not experienced as significant price appreciation, Deutscher mentions Sei Network (SEI) and Sui(SUI). Deutscher suggests that these two altcoins could potentially have their time to shine in the current market conditions. Near Protocol (NEAR) is another coin that Deutscher believes could have a breakout moment. The analyst notes the lack of significant resistance on the way to $5, indicating the potential for substantial price movement. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Cardano Price Will Rise 6000% To $33, Here’s The Timeline Deutscher also discusses Arbitrum (ARB), suggesting that people are considering it as a potential rotation play. Deutscher speculates that the launch of a meme coin and the upcoming Coinbase Futures listing of Arbitrum could attract liquidity and initiate a mini Layer 2 (L2) season. Within the Solana ecosystem, Deutscher highlights the recent airdrops of Pyth Network (PYTH), Juggernaut (JTO), and Jupiter (JUP). Deutscher mentions the buzz surrounding airdrop farming and suggests that opportunities may still exist within the ecosystem. Deutscher concludes by mentioning Frax Share (FXS), noting the upcoming halving, the launch of Fraxchain in Q1 2024, and the potential release of frxETH V2. Deutscher believes that FXS is currently undervalued and hints at the possibility of a future airdrop.

Amid these fluctuations, the flagship cryptocurrency has been intensely scrutinized. Despite its decline from the recent peak of $44,000, a crypto analyst urged the community not to “succumb to panic.” The current market situation reflects a typical correction phase rather than a long-term bearish trend. According to Ali Charts, a prominent crypto analyst, Bitcoin has established a “robust” support zone between $37,150 and $38,360. This critical range is bolstered by the activity of approximately 1.52 million addresses that collectively purchased roughly 534,000 BTC at that price point, as indicated by Ali. Related Reading: Market Jolt: Bitcoin Falls Below $42,000 As Short Term Holders Rush To Cash In The analyst suggests that the significant accumulation forms a “strong” foundation, potentially preventing further declines in Bitcoin’s value. Bitcoin’s Resistance And The Road Ahead Despite the recent market downturn, Bitcoin’s potential for recovery and continued growth remains a subject of interest. Ali has also identified two key resistance levels at $43,850 and $46,400 that could challenge Bitcoin’s upward momentum. These points represent significant thresholds where selling pressure may intensify, potentially hindering Bitcoin’s ability to reclaim its recent highs. In case of a deeper correction, #Bitcoin finds solid support between $37,150 and $38,360. This zone is backed by 1.52 million addresses holding 534,000 $BTC. Also, watch out for two resistance walls that could keep the #BTC uptrend at bay: one at $43,850 and another at $46,400. pic.twitter.com/NGm1XpMOLf — Ali (@ali_charts) December 11, 2023 Meanwhile, the past 24 hours have seen Bitcoin’s price dip by 0.3% with a price below $42,000, continuing its retreat from the $44,000 mark. This reduction in value is mirrored in the crypto’s trading volume, which has fallen from $37 billion to $21 billion. This decline indicates a decreased trading activity, suggesting a cooling-off period following the recent market rally. The Positive Side Of The Bitcoin Pullback Amid concerns over Bitcoin’s price fluctuations, experts like William Clemente, co-founder of Reflexivity Research, offer a different perspective. Clemente emphasizes that the current pullback, potentially bringing Bitcoin’s price to around $40,000, is not necessarily a negative development. Clemente argues that this correction is essential for “shaking out weak hands” and reducing leverage in the market, ultimately laying a more solid foundation for future growth. Related Reading: The Bitcoin Spot ETF Boom: VanEck Forecasts $2.4 Billion Inflows In Q1 2024 The Co-founder of Reflexivity Research further noted that “Bitcoin’s volatility is a feature, not a bug.” BTC just ~doubled in 2 months with no pull backs, a correction is not that surprising. Corrections shake out “weak hands” and leverage, allowing for a stronger foundation for eventual moves higher. Bitcoin’s volatility is a feature, not a bug.

FTX Challenges IRS’s $24 Billion Tax Bill According to court filings and FTX’s response to the IRS’s claims, several key arguments challenge the basis of the tax bill. Firstly, FTX highlights that its operations spanned three years, never distributing dividends or earnings. Secondly, the exchange’s defense attorneys claim that the company incurred substantial losses rather than generating income that could support the IRS’s “exorbitant” tax claim. Thirdly, the lawyers argue that FTX is currently in liquidation and is not engaged in any ongoing business activities apart from those required for the liquidation process. Finally, the company emphasizes that the recovery sought by the IRS would ultimately come at the expense of FTX’s victims, as the funds would be redirected away from their rightful recipients. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) 50% Rally Sets Stage For A Merry Christmas – Details As the court hearing approaches, FTX asserts that proceeding with a court-supervised estimation process would demonstrate the company’s significant losses during its operational period, rendering the IRS’s claim “baseless.” FTX emphasizes that any forced payment would harm the victims of the FTX fraud, many of whom are already grappling with “profound losses.” FTX’s administrators have managed to recover approximately $7 billion in assets, including $3.4 billion in cryptocurrencies. These figures underscore the complex financial landscape surrounding the IRS’s claim against FTX. As the courtroom showdown ensues, the case outcome will undoubtedly have significant implications for the future of crypto taxation and the recovery prospects of FTX’s creditors. FTT’s Bullish Trend Holds Strong As the cryptocurrency market experiences a significant correction following a bullish surge led by Bitcoin (BTC), FTX’s native token, FTT, has seen a decline of over 5% in the past 24 hours, adding to the company’s legal concerns. After a three-month accumulation phase that kept FTT trading in a range between $0.9 and $1.2 from September to the beginning of November, the token witnessed an impressive surge in the last month, reaching its highest price of the year at $6.042, a level not seen since November 2022. However, the token has retraced to its current price mark of $4.8, with the next support level at $4.45 in case of further downward movement.

Furthermore, since the beginning of November, FTT has consistently recorded higher highs and higher lows, forming an uptrend pattern. This trend has been observed three times, with the token experiencing an uptrend, followed by a pullback for a support test, and then a continuation to reach new highs. Assuming this trend continues and the legal developments do not have a significant impact on the price of the token, FTT may be poised for a significant rise in the coming months, given the remarkable uptrend pattern seen on the daily chart.

21329006,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=565035,1702425654,Dogecoin Sell Signal Goes Off: Analyst Predicts Targets,"A Dogecoin sell signal has appeared on the weekly price chart. According to an analyst, here are the targets the coin could potentially dip to. Dogecoin Has Observed A TD Sequential Sell Signal Recently As explained by analyst Ali in a new post on X, TD Sequential has flagged a sell signal for DOGE. The “Tom Demark (TD) Sequential” here refers to an indicator in technical analysis that’s popularly used for finding points of probable tops and bottoms in any asset’s price. There are two phases involved in this metric. During the first, candles of the same polarity are counted up to nine, and at the end of these nine candles is a potential reversal point for the asset. This phase is called the “setup.” If the candles leading to the setup’s completion were green, then the TD Sequential would give a sell signal for the chart. On the other hand, if they were red, the signal would be a buy one. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rushes To Exchanges, But This Sign Remains Positive For The Bulls The other phase is the “countdown,” which kicks off as soon as the setup is complete. This phase is thirteen candles long; at the end of these thirteen, another probable top or bottom occurs for the price. Dogecoin has seen its weekly price complete a TD Sequential setup recently. Below is the chart shared by the analyst that highlights this pattern in the memecoin. Looks like the asset has recently seen nine green candles | Source: @ali_charts on X As is visible in the graph, the TD Sequential has completed the setup phase on the weekly chart of Dogecoin with green candles recently. This could indicate that the coin may reverse towards a downtrend from here on out. “This comes as DOGE faces a key resistance level that has repeatedly thwarted its climbs in the past,” explains Ali. “A correction could see prices dip to $0.085 or even $0.078.” The former target would mean a decrease of about 11% from the current cryptocurrency price, while the latter would suggest a drawdown of more than 18%. Not all hope may be lost for Dogecoin, though, as the analyst notes, “if DOGE can surge past $0.11, the bearish scenario gets negated.” A few days ago, Ali also shared this chart that showed the on-chain support and resistance map of the memecoin: The cost basis distribution of the asset | Source: @ali_charts on X In on-chain analysis, support and resistance are defined based on the concentration of investors who bought at a particular level. Price ranges hosting the cost basis of many addresses provide strong support/resistance when the asset’s spot price retests them. Related Reading: Crypto Market Crashes: Traders React With “Buy The Dip” Calls The chart shows that the $0.094 to $0.097 range is the strongest support zone for the asset out of all the listed ranges. Dogecoin has declined into this zone recently, so it’s a test of whether on-chain support can hold against the technical sell signal that has recently formed. DOGE Price At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at around $0.096, up 7% in the past week.
