42383136,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uEEx,1578162592,"How Libra Failed, and How It Could Succeed in 2020","This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Richie Hecker is an entrepreneur, and management consultant at Traction & Scale.      2019 was the year of Libra rising – an attempt led by Facebook to create a new form of digital currency and banking system. Transformative in potential and huge in aspirations, Libra was the seminal crypto event of 2019. Yet, like most of the ICOs that predated it, Libra is doomed to fail in its current form. There, I said it.      Yes, I’m a big believer in the transformative power of technology for the underbanked to make it easier to save money and build credit. Unfortunately, Libra in its current form is not the solution because it offers an overcomplicated approach that will make it extremely difficult to execute. For background on where I am coming from, I have run a community with 100 million users and spent many years in financial services including working on bank acquisitions.      Facebook could create a global payments network, which can benefit users around the world. With its billions of users and experience with scaling systems, Facebook already has the basic infrastructure in place to create a transformative payments system. If you add in all of the partners lined up as shareholders of Libra, it covers the gamut of global payments and commerce and should be able to succeed.      This opportunity exists because the current banking system is closed. There are a host of regulatory licenses needed to hold, send and store money. Regulatory scrutiny is meant to ensure safety and security, to protect citizens from fraud and to prevent money laundering. But too often these controls kill competition and raise prices, leaving room for improvement in the system.      Often, consumers cannot send wires on weekends and it can take days for global payments to clear between banks. The banks themselves are developing a real-time commercial payments platforms but they are not quite there yet. Banks have Zelle for real-time peer-to-peer payments and it works well, but you need to be a bank to use it. PayPal has Venmo, which works for individuals. The banks also have a B2B RTP network through The Clearing House that is live.      It is nascent but it exists and the Federal Reserve is also developing its own real-time payments network called Fed Now for 24/7/365 payments. This will eventually come to life. This may make it difficult for a startup to compete long term.    Libra good and bad    So what is Libra and why is it doomed to fail?      Libra creates a digital token representing a basket of assets and a payment system designed to make it easy to send money around the world. According to the white paper, “Libra’s mission is to enable a simple global currency and financial infrastructure that empowers billions of people.”      In a way, it is Venmo with its own currency running on a new real-time payment system. This payment system would be open 24/7, as opposed to the current banking system that is only partially 24/7 – those connected with Zelle and RTP.      Libra creates a phantom payment network on top of existing currencies. The phantom currency represents traditional assets like dollars and transfers instantly, and then the actual assets can settle later.      Libra says it will be backed by a basket of assets, but is not clear on exactly what assets will be inside of a Libra. This lack of clarity over what assets it will comprise will likely lead to regulatory jurisdiction vs jurisdiction hell. Every regulator touched by Libra will begin investigating it. It is not clear if it is a currency, a derivative, a security, a commodity pool, and so on. Thus, it isn’t clear which laws apply. Jurisdictions will likely disagree with each other on this point, as they do already in defining digital currencies at home. Nation-states could easily fight over the aspects over digital money, as there does not appear to be any enacted international trade agreements that govern this type of financial arrangement.      Even after Libra works outits legal jurisdiction, it will still be very hard to create the desired benefits for its stated use-cases. Libra’s stated goal is to provide digital banking for the 1.7 billion unbanked; provide a way for people in volatile markets to hold a stable asset; and offer a cheap way to exchange money worldwide. But these benefits will be extremely difficult to achieve.    Many of these issues can be addressed by learning one big lesson from the father of payments networks – Visa.    In Libra’s proposed system, banking the unbanked will still require full due diligence and adhering to “Know Your Customer” regulations to combat money laundering, which could result in that signing up for Libra will be similar to dealing with any bank today with similar challenges. The on/off ramps are different but the regulations are similar.      The expensive part of instituting a currency exchange is the “last mile,” which Libra cannot solve without building its own in-person network or partnering with existing retail and ATM networks. M-PESA, the East African mobile money transfer system regarded as a top system addressing the underbanked, partners with Western Union and other incumbent networks, so users can make it easier to send and receive money. M-PESA has 28 million active customers and facilitates 50 pertcent of Kenya GDP. M-PESA’s customers will now be able to send money to anyone in the 200 countries in which Western Union operates.      Libra could set up similar partnerships to withdraw cash, or enable digital transfers and simply do it at a lower cost, by introducing itself as competition. In some countries, replicating local withdrawal networks will prove challenging. The cell networks are the key gatekeepers for mobile money in the developing world. It will be hard to compete with the carriers that have an existing most and user trust. However, a new offering could lead to a price war that could help customers or to Libra taking losses to subsidize growth. This is the equivalent of Western Union lowering its fees to add more value back to its customers. This could be greatly add value.      The real cost of sending a payment is low and the cost of wholesale currency conversion is low so it is possible to do lower cost payments. If Facebook can create an internally coherent payments and consumer ecosystem, it will incur fewer on/off ramp costs. The big opportunity for Libra, aside from developing a wallet, is working with retailers and others to sell consumers products based on their net worth and spending habits. This it can do with the in-network money without worrying about consumers breaking back to fiat.      Most countries with volatile currencies have currency controls, which they will place on Libra, essentially making it money laundering to create an inflation hedge. For example, a government could make it illegal to buy or transfer more than a government-mandated threshold of Libra each year, and therefore converting out of the local currency would be a crime. Chinese nationals are able to transfer up to only $50,000 per person per year out of the country. China could easily pass a law to say any financial asset or cryptocurrency would fall under the rule as well.      Even if Libra figures out a way to launch and achieve its stated goals, it will likely be crushed by fraud. Libra does not have a clear policy and process for fraud prevention engine or a simple mechanism to solve fraud disputes. Essentially, it creates a wild west free for all. So the lack of fraud controls will likely lead to a bad actor immediately creating an app to defraud people into sending their Libra to the scammer. Mobile bankers in Kenya sometimes keep all of their savings on their phone and routinely get scammed into giving up their passwords.      Libra has great promise but has serious challenges to overcome. Many of these issues can be addressed by learning one big lesson from the father of payments networks – Visa. Visa started as Bank Americard, inside Bank of America, as an internal credit system. Then it became a system licensed to other banks and finally an association owned by its members and a public company. This staging approach allowed it to grow steadily and avoid undue regulatory and political burdens until it was ready to take over.    How to make Libra work    Follow the same path of Visa.One, back Libra initially with only U.S. dollars or another single currency. This will enable Libra to launch within the current U.S. banking regulatory framework. If it launches inside the U.S. banking system, it will be respected everywhere, with the possible exception of China. There are clear ways to set this up, so it would pass all regulatory scrutiny. By including other assets, Libra brings a host of potential regulatory conflicts on itself, so even if it wins regulatory approval, that approval will be expensive and time consuming.      Two, the network should centralize administration so there is an anti-fraud system in place and a clear body to communicate with for regulatory scrutiny. What Libra proposed is essentially centralized anyway, with a single database to run the system.      Facebook has such a large network that implementing a low-fee payment system would be a huge first step. It can invite others onto the platform and finally turn it into a consortium once the bugs are removed and it has passed regulatory scrutiny. In fact, Facebook already has the infrastructure for this – payments inside of Messenger. It already has an anti-fraud system and it is tied to your Facebook ID.      Three, after that, Facebook can enable people to build applications on top of the existing payments system. This step likely won’t require much additional regulatory requirements. Facebook mastered apps many years ago.      These steps, implemented properly, will make it easy for Libra to launch and avoid being shut down by regulators. The cost of these steps will be steep. They would require almost total centralization and be a continuation of their existing business. But the benefit could be fast, fair global banking.

42383129,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uE7P,1578151800,Professor Ben Noys: What Crypto Sees in Accelerationism,"This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Benjamin Noys, a professor at the University of Chichester, in the UK, invented the term ""accelerationism"" for a philosophy that says technological progress should be greatly sped up.      In his book Malign Velocities: Accelerationism and Capitalism (Zero Books, 2014), Benjamin Noys defines accelerationism as the idea that capitalism should be pushed to ever-dizzying speeds to bring about a new future. Markets, technological progress and intelligence are all attributes of the same engine of history, which sometimes proceeds at the expense of humanity. Adherents argue the process of disrupting traditions, uprooting ecosystems and alienating individuals cannot be stopped. The only response is to accelerate.      Five years on, Noys is now looking to uncover the links between this fringe philosophy, which exists mostly online, and the emergence of internet-native currencies. I recently spoke with him by phone. During our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity, we discussed what the alt-right sees in crypto, how accelerationism has entered mainstream discourse and the mystical experience of holding money.      Can you describe your research into cryptocurrency?      What interests me are the political aspects and debates around cryptocurrency, particularly in the way it’s been embraced by figures on the extreme right. I look at cryptocurrency as embodying a paradox. On the one hand it’s the most virtual form of money, entirely digital, and on the other hand it embodies stability in that it’s encrypted beyond government and other forms of interference. This dual perspective allows you to embrace both a desire for dissolving institutions and forms and embracing capitalism at its most extreme while preserving hierarchies between those who possess value and those who don’t.      How does a decentralized system preserve hierarchy?      Bitcoins are extremely deterritorialized, they belong to no one except their owners, and are not subject to any form of central control. This preserves the idea of value associated with those that possess monetary value. In some of the more extreme neo-reactionary movements, this hierarchy gets reinvented as the “the wealthy are better than the rest.” So those who embrace risk, speculation and the digital become the new lords or overlords.      It’s an argument by analogy? Because monetary hierarchies exist that validates other hierarchies – like racial or gender inequalities – for the extreme right.      Figures like Nick Land, and other neoreactionaries, do embrace or come close to embracing racialized positions, while at the same time hedging by saying ‘we only embrace pure capitalism.’ So they put a distance between themselves and traditional rightwing politics, but to me, they still embrace rightwing traditional values of racial and social hierarchies. It uses a hierarchy of value to dictate social value.      It seems like some of Nick Land’s support for bitcoin borders on the metaphysical. I was wondering if you’ve grappled with any of that?      I’m interested in the philosophical implications of crypto. There’s an argument that the birth of philosophy as a discipline runs parallel to the explosion of monetary economies in ancient Greece. That’s a speculative argument, but there are some interesting links between money as an abstract speculative medium and philosophy as an abstract speculative mode. That’s why I’m interested in how this particular form of digital currency aligns, can link with or generates political or social fantasies.      Are there larger societal implications of having censorship-resistant currencies?      We don’t know what the implications will be. This is what some people are celebrating. It’s an experiment and the consequences of the experiment are very unclear. The notion of currencies that are free from government or forms of social control offers many political possibilities. It doesn’t necessarily have to be rightwing or reactionary ones. At the moment, it’s interesting how the agenda of freedom from government tends to be pitched in a rightwing direction. Probably often by people that haven’t used cryptocurrencies. They’re kind of an object of fantasy.      Could you discuss how these reactionary ideas have entered into political discourse or wider culture?      Accelerationism is a broad church of different thinkers and ideas that emerged in the last ten or so years – obviously triggered by the financial crisis of 2008 and by the dominance of the internet – to try to deal with the question of how do we deal with technology today. The broad definition is the embrace or accelerate certain forms of technology or social reforms to push through our current capitalist state to a new future.      It can take left-wing forms, where a post-capitalist future would not be based on a current capitalist market but would still use current technologies like the internet to distribute wealth, or use cryptocurrencies to encourage a more egalitarian social order. And there are right-wing forms that want to accelerate capitalism into a purer form. There are also reactionary or even high-fascist forms: people who want a kind of combo between capitalism coupled with fascistic forms of authority.      Do you have an answer of how to appropriately deal with technology?      The irony is I’m a critic of accelerationism, but they have an answer: accelerate, engage more, speed things up. My answer is more critical or negative. We need to think through our approach to techno-social forms. But I don’t think my idea is to slow down or embrace technology. The answer isn’t to become a Luddite or an accelerationist.      Are you also critical of the idea that technological process is outside the control of humanity, like opening Pandora’s Box?      There have been ideas about singularities or technological determinism. Now it’s, ""AI will realize itself whether we like it or not."" I’m critical of it, but we have given up a lot of potential ways in which we could control or manage or develop technologies. That’s part of the social context in which we work: These things are left to the quote-unquote market. There is a tendency to say we have no control, you just have to deal with the consequences of progress. That speaks to a limit of our political imagination. We can’t imagine taking control or regulating.      What do you make of states embracing cryptocurrencies? This past year China, the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank have all said they are experimenting with their own coins.      It’s an interesting pattern of what Deleuze and Guattari have called re-territorialization. Tech gets reintegrated, so people who are using crypto to escape state control are caught up. States aren’t stupid. They know they will have to develop their own. States want or need to have a monopoly over money, in the same way they have a monopoly over violence. So it doesn’t surprise me states are experimenting with crypto. They are presumably working on artificial intelligence as well. It’ll be part of the future struggle over money.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/01/04/professor-ben-noys-what-crypto-sees-in-accelerationism,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/940e07fa4fd8ba21a4fa90dcfaed25d7eca25b9d-750x672.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383130,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uEBB,1578146400,"While We Wait for Laws, We Need Better Interpretations of Existing Regulation","This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. William Mougayar is the author of “The Business Blockchain,” producer of the Token Summit and a venture investor and advisor.      When it comes to U.S. cryptocurrency regulation, one school of thought says it’s worth waiting for congressional action to deliver a friendlier regulatory environment, resulting in a re-energized blockchain market and underlying entrepreneurial activity.      Another viewpoint, which I share, says Congress provides no magic pill or panacea due to the long time it takes to pass new acts and bills. Instead, we need to seek modernized interpretations of current regulations, especially securities laws under the Security and Exchange Commission’s purview.    Few new acts since 1933    There is little hope in seeing a new cryptocurrency- or blockchain-related act emerge from the House or Senate in the next 12 months, if not longer. This is an election year, so the public attention span is elsewhere. Also, we need to factor in the ongoing distractions on omnipresent geopolitical, economic or social agenda items within the United States and beyond. The blockchain faces all of these preceding and competing priorities.      In eight decades of history, the SEC has been moved by a relatively small number of new pieces of legislation. From the independent agency’s web site: the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939;Investment Company Act of 1940, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940;,the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012.      Since the Securities Act of 1933, there have been only seven other acts, four of which came before 1940, followed by three more after 2002, and none for more than 60 years in between. That’s an average of one act per decade. Based on this, it is hard to imagine a dedicated financial blockchain act emerging in 2020.      There is a common pattern to these acts: they tend to be reactionary outcomes to significant incidents. The Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 were born of the severity of abuses that led to the crash of 1929. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 was prompted by the Enron scandal. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 was concocted in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis.    Libra    The Facebook-Libra mid-2019 announcement caused a blip in the political attention scale. After Congressional Hearings July-October, the House of Representatives proposed a new Bill to establish the treatment of managed stablecoins under the 1933 Securities Act, titled “Stablecoins Are Securities Act of 2019.” This bill was squarely aimed at limiting the wingspan of the Libra project. However, it faced immediate criticism. It was rushed and resulted in also being a potential threat to other existing stablecoins. This proposed bill was throwing out the baby with the bathwater.      Since 2013 there have been approximately 100 blockchain- or FinTech-related legislative proposals, not including state bills (Source: Digital Asset Affairs). The five that passed mentioned blockchain in minor ways. In fact, proposed bills have an average success rate of 2 percent to 5 percent. There is a lack of support required to muscle in legislative change, despite the valiant efforts of industry organizations such as the Coin Center, Blockchain Association and Digital Chamber of Commerce. Bills and acts are forever dying on the proverbial Capitol Hill vine.    Why no rulemaking for blockchain?    A quick scan of the SEC’s Rulemaking Index for 2019 points to a long list of 36 Proposed or Final Rules for amending or updating a variety of activities on topics such as Accredited Investor Definition, Cross-Border Applications for Security-Based Swap Requirements, Exemptions from the Proxy Rules for Proxy Voting Advice, Payment Methods Modernization, Modernization of Regulation S-K items, and several other subjects.    There is a lack of support required to muscle in legislative change.    These were very specific and prescriptive updates, some of them going as far as including updates to the EDGAR filing manual.      The sad irony of this finding is twofold. First, none of these rulemaking updates included anything about blockchain or cryptocurrency. Second, this activity seemingly took place without an attachment to new legislation, i.e. the SEC acted on its own, based on market feedback and the desire to continuously modernize their oversight processes.      Sadly, the SEC has not shown a similar degree of willingness to create modern interpretations for cryptocurrency with the same vigor and intensity they have given other aspects of the securities laws.    Nothing new here    Instead, the SEC resorted to occasionally releasing haphazard guidance statements that were not even consistent with each other, initiating dozens of investigations and launching a few lawsuits or enforcement actions. All and all, the SEC gradually left the industry craving for more clarity or prescriptive guidelines that could have taken into account the innovative implications of token-based projects who were gasping for air and clamoring to see the light of day under a friendlier regulatory climate.      Regrettably, no added insight, clarity or lessons have resulted from this enforcement-led strategy and agenda. The SEC kept implying there was nothing new here, that the existing securities laws were good enough and that companies should line up to follow these rules.      But companies did not line up to spend $2 million in legal fees to follow a Reg A+ process, as the SEC might have wished. Instead, the majority of U.S.-based projects either folded their ambitions or fled to more clement international jurisdictions.    Companies did not line up to spend $2M in legal fees to follow a Reg A+ process.    We learned in 2019 that Reg A+ is not the model. Only two companies filed under that process, Blockstack and YouNow; only Blockstack has launched an offering. Fast forward to now and Blockstack’s token value is trading at one-third of its offering price, having lost money for consumers who were investors.      Ironically, filing under the SEC rules was an argument used by the SEC to pinpoint the lowering of risks and losses. This shows that even if you followed the (expensive) SEC regulatory process, consumers would not be immune to potentially losing their money. Of course there are many other success factors in play, but the SEC is not so attuned to these nuances. This also suggests that cryptocurrency and blockchain technology deserve their own share of rulemaking.    Is Hester Peirce our only hope?    It would be wrong to assume everyone at the SEC is oblivious about the blockchain. Commissioner Hester Peirce has been a breath of fresh air, and perhaps the only visible hope that the SEC might one day improve its position.      Through her many speeches, Commissioner Peirce has given the industry hope and a glimpse of what a blockchain-friendly SEC could be doing.      For example, this short passage from a recent speech entitled Broken Windows: Remarks Before the 51st Annual Institute on Securities Regulation, sums up the somber reality we are in:      “I am concerned about how the SEC has regulated this space because I believe our lack of a workable regulatory framework has hindered innovation and growth. The only guidance out of the SEC is a parade of enforcement actions and a set of staff guidance documents and staff no-action letters…Of particular concern is that these enforcement actions and guidance pieces, taken together, offer no clear path for a functioning token network to emerge.”    What the SEC could have done    Many individuals in the blockchain industry would rejoice at the thought of Hester Peirce becoming the next SEC Chair, along with the anticipation that a change of leadership would usher a positive shift in U.S. regulatory strategy.      We shouldn’t hold our breath for new congressional action on cryptocurrencies. But while we are still stuck with a complacent SEC stance, we could dream a little about what a better regulatory climate for cryptocurrency could have looked like.      Here is a list of potential actions that could have been undertaken by the SEC:    Introduce new filing processes with defined disclosure criteria and details tailored for blockchain technology projects.  Institute a Safe Harbor policy with specific terms and conditions to relieve qualified projects from the burden of unnecessary compliance requirements.  Restrict the amounts to be raised during token offerings as a way to limit the potential downsides.  Provide more prescriptive and precise guidance that entrepreneurs can apply without guesswork and with less legal resources.    As well as making concrete action, the SEC needs to answer two vexing, but fundamental questions, which it mostly avoids:      Why are there no modernized rulemaking updates for cryptocurrency and blockchain technology?      Why are the recommendations and ideas behind many of Hester Peirce’s speeches not being followed up by the SEC?      The blockchain novelty aspect is staring the SEC in the eye but it remains in a state of denial that something is new here.      The world was expecting the U.S. to lead on regulatory guidance for blockchain technology, but the SEC has not answered the challenge. Instead, we are faced with a panoply of local regulatory positions from 130 countries that are as diverse as their peoples, while being difficult to reconcile for the average entrepreneur who must think global.      There is no point “HODLing” hope for new congressional legislation, but we can wish for a new chapter of more enlightened SEC leadership.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,William Mougayar,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/01/04/while-we-wait-for-laws-we-need-better-interpretations-of-existing-regulation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8c55ef9a0745c043d097f3bd91a265ad4958eedc-2000x1083.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
