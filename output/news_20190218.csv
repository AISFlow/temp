42381562,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9nLJH,1550529392,Privacy Crypto Beam Gets Funding from 'Japanese LinkedIn' Recruit,"Privacy-oriented cryptocurrency startup Beam has secured an undisclosed amount of funding from Japan’s equivalent to LinkedIn, Recruit Co., Ltd.  Recruit announced the news Monday, stating that the investment was made through its $25 million RSP Blockchain Tech Fund, which was set up last November. Beam confirmed the investment in a Tweet the same day, stating that Recruit invested prior to its mainnet launch last month, adding:  “This investment helps Beam fulfill its mission in Japan too when it comes to deploying a compliant, scalable, and confidential cryptocurrency.”  Recruit said the reason it backed the firm was because Beam provides a blockchain that prevents the exposure of transaction data to third parties, thus protecting user's information.  Beam went live back in January and became one of the first cryptocurrencies based on Mimblewimble, a protocol that makes transactions confidential and reduces the size of the overall blockchain. Since launch though, the project has faced some technical difficulties. Most recently, its network stopped for a a number of hours before operations were restored.  Through its RSP Blockchain Tech Fund, a venture between Recruit and its subsidiary Recruit Strategic Partners, Inc. (RSP), Recruit said it aims to invest in “promising” blockchain companies.  Besides Beam, Recruit has also invested in four other startups in the blockchain space, according to its website. These include crypto debit cards provider Shift Payments, blockchain identity startup ShoCard, blockchain payments provider Veem and Japanese bitcoin exchange BitFlyer.

42381569,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9nLPZ,1550523341,Blockstream Releases Test Code for Proposed Bitcoin Tech Upgrade Schnorr,"Schnorr signatures, a code change likely to be one of the biggest coming upgrades to bitcoin, have now gone from a theoretical idea to real code courtesy of technology startup Blockstream.  Announced Monday  , Blockstream has added a technology known as ""MuSig"" to its test cryptographic library, making it possible for developers to tinker with the Schnorr signature scheme and potentially find bugs.  That the code is being opened up to the public to test is an exciting step because, if Schnorr is one day added to bitcoin, the new digital signature scheme could add privacy and bitcoin scalability improvements down the line. As such, developers have been eyeing the technology for quite some time.  Blockstream mathematician Andrew Poelstra wrote in the announcement blog post:  ""We’ve been turning MuSig from an academic paper into usable code, and this week we merged that code into secp256k1-zkp, a fork of secp256k1, the high-assurance cryptographic library used by Bitcoin Core.""  It's been a theoretical upgrade for years, with cryptographers making mathematical progress last year necessary to ensure the scheme's security. This will be the first time the code opened up for testing.  ""To address these concerns, we started an initiative to design a new signature scheme, and a significant practical engineering effort to implement it in a robust and antifragile way,"" Poelstra added.  Most bitcoin developers think it's a positive upgrade and some have already started thinking about what new technologies can be built on top of it. For instance, developers have theorized how it could help anonymize lightning transactions, considered to be a more feasible and speedy system of payments on bitcoin.  ""As the bitcoin community is exploring the use of Schnorr signatures in bitcoin we hope that our code will eventually be merged into the upstream library secp256k1 used by bitcoin core and many other projects,"" Poelstra added.  To that end, he invites developers to play around with the code, which can be found on GitHub and to give feedback.

The number of long positions on bitcoin's US dollar-denominated exchange rate (BTC/USD) jumped to 38,237 BTC at 04:10 BTC - the highest level since March 30, 2018 – and were last seen at 36,176 BTC.  While long positions have risen by 35 percent in the last three weeks, short positions have remained largely unchanged. As a result, the long-short ratio, a barometer of market sentiment, has improved to 1.5 from 1.18.  The market mood has indeed turned bullish but hasn't reached extremes, as long positions are still at least 8 percent short of the record high of 40,193 registered on March 26, 2018.  That said, BTC's rally to 5.5-week highs above $3,900 has likely opened the doors to a convincing move above $4,000. That would only attract buyers, pushing BTC/USD longs to fresh record highs.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $3,912 on Bitfinex, the highest level since Jan. 10. The cryptocurrency would become vulnerable to ""long squeeze"" – a sudden pullback in prices due to an unwinding of long positions – if and when the bullish sentiment reaches extremes.

Announced Saturday, the beta app Tippin has released a new Chrome Extension available to Google browser users. Over Twitter, app users can send bitcoin payments via the Lightning Network, considered a way to make bitcoin transactions feasible at a large scale for the first time.  With the extension enabled, a little lightning bolt symbol pops up inside every tweet next to the more familiar ""like"" and ""retweet"" buttons.  [video width=""1920"" height=""1080"" mp4=""https://www.coindesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/tippin.mp4""][/video]  Video from Tippin  It builds off an old idea that small payments are one of bitcoin's selling points. (Bitcoin app ChangeTip was once a popular way to send payments over social media, but it died out in 2016.)  Tippin engineer Sergio Abril told CoinDesk:  ""In my opinion, tipping is going to be incredibly popular with lightning network; It’s the first time we can send small amounts almost at no cost, and we can do it incredibly fast.""  All a user needs is a Twitter account and to install Tippin to receive tips. As such, Tippin hopes to capitalize on crypto Twitter power users to drive growth.  ""Tippin started as a personal side project a couple of months ago, so I could understand lightning network a bit more, and of course help push adoption, but it’s starting to get big,"" Abril said.  Abril has ideas for expanding the app into the future, including adding support on other social media platforms. Also, for now, the app is custodial, meaning users don't have complete control over their funds, because, according to Abril, the app is much easier to use this way.  But he has plans to look into non-custodial options as well.  Abril added:  ""Of course, lightning network itself is still in beta, so we have time to make this happen until it’s fully ready.""

42381566,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9nLN3,1550502057,Will Crypto Torch Jamie Dimon?,"Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk’s advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.    ___________    Will the crypto community torch Jamie Dimon?  Now, before I get “deep-stated” off social media, I need to clarify that I am most definitely speaking metaphorically here. Actual violence is never an option, kids.  I am referring to twin occurrences in the world of blockchain technology that offer competing visions of how it will develop.  The first was the widely reported news that that JPMorgan, whose CEO is the notoriously anti-bitcoin Dimon, will issue a JPM-branded digital currency, managed by its own permissioned distributed ledger, for use by its large-scale corporate and institutional clients operating within the bank’s $6 trillion daily wholesale payments operations.  The second was the growing interest within the crypto community around the Lightning Torch, an experiment launched on January 19 that’s revealing aspects of both the technical and social functionality of the nascent Lightning network. As communicated over Twitter using the hashtag #LNTrustChain, users who receive the torch’s growing pool of bitcoin are asked to add 10,000 satoshis (0.0001 BTC, or approximately 35 cents) and pass it onto someone who they trust will send the torch to someone else.  After 199 hops and only a few snafus, the torch on Friday afternoon was still alive in the hands of Meltem Demirors, Chief Strategy Officer at CoinShares, and it contained 3.35 million satoshis. Once the total reaches a hard limit of 4.39 million satoshis, or around $156, the community has resolved to donate the funds to a charity.  A tale of two 'crypto' projects  There you have it: One centrally managed, corporate initiative to improve global transfers for a business that moves the equivalent of almost a third of U.S. GDP every day, and a second, separate project that’s led by a decentralized community, and which, after almost a month, is yet to reach its top value of $156.  Naturally, what JPMorgan is doing is getting more attention in the mainstream press, not just because of the sums involved but also because the apparent disjuncture between Dimon’s disdain for bitcoin and the bank’s embrace of what it’s calling a “cryptocurrency” makes a good headline. (For the record, I concur with Coin Center’s Jerry Brito: JPM Coin is not a cryptocurrency.)  But notwithstanding the sophisticated cryptography and protocol design behind JPMorgan’s Quorum distributed ledger system and this digital currency implementation, I’d argue that the Lightning Torch users are working on a much bigger and more important problem.  They are mapping out the framework for a radically different peer-to-peer, instantaneous payments system that involves no intermediaries. It’s a model for global, digital cash.  That’s a much bigger deal than a bank using a distributed ledger, one that it controls, to enable large institutions it already works with to more efficiently shift money around within the same intermediated banking system.  Don’t get me wrong: what JPMorgan is doing may well unlock a huge amount of value in the massive, friction-filled world of cross-border fund movements. For the time being, multinational businesses will continue to use what they are used to: dollars and banks. When one of the biggest banks comes up with a more efficient way to send and receive dollars, why wouldn’t they use it?  But, let’s face it, trillions of dollars or not, JPMorgan, by building a system that intrinsically depends on its own intermediation, is not doing anything nearly as radical as peer-to-peer transactions in bitcoin over the Lightning Network.  The proof of that, ironically, lies in the fact that Lightning Torch is dealing in in small amounts. The overhead-heavy, trust-intensified, middleman-laden infrastructure of the banking system makes it prohibitively costly to send tiny amounts through it, regardless of whether the instrument of exchange is digital or not.  But people, if not large corporations, need to send small amounts to each other, all the time. The same will go for billions of devices on the Internet of Things. Efficient, decentralized, electronic micropayments will be vital to the online economy of the future.  It’s one reason why Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter, sees bitcoin eventually being the “native currency” of the Internet and why, as an investor in Lightning development company Lightning Labs, he was one of the participants in the Lightning Torch relay.  Why Lightning Torch matters  There’s no guarantee of success for Lightning, a so-called “Layer 2” solution to bitcoin’s scaling and cost challenges that achieves greater efficiency by opening smart contract-controlled, peer-to-peer payment channels operated off-chain. Some worry that the only way the technology can foster a viable global network of interlinked payment channels is for profit-making companies to take charge of ever-growing hubs in what would be a de facto centralizing solution.  That’s why experiments like the Lightning Torch relay, as trivial as they might seem to outsiders, are vital. People involved in Lightning’s development need to experience real-world functionality. This has always been the case for the evolution of bitcoin itself, which, beyond finding bugs in the code, also required community leaders and entrepreneurs to figure out the social and economic components of the overarching exchange system.  No wonder people have drawn comparisons to this event and past community initiatives to test bitcoin’s real-world value, such as Laszlo Hanyecz’s 2010 purchase of two Papa John’s pizzas for 10,000 BTC. (There’s even a nod to that with a new Lightning app that lets you buy pizza.)  These kinds of low-stakes transactions matter, both because they are a risk-minimizing way to demonstrate real-world functionality and because engaging people in all the complex aspects of exchange systems can help designers come up with better solutions. Andreas Antonopoulos told CoinDesk that because payment routing is not yet automated, as the size of the torch gets larger, users have been challenged to find workable routes to get money to new recipients through their interlinked networks of payment channels. This will help people unearth bugs in the system until it can be more automated, he noted.  Bitcoin’s initial success in building out a real-world community of users on the basis of similarly small-scale experiments is what ultimately put cryptocurrency, and later blockchain technology, onto the radar of the world’s banks, and led them to explore aspects of that technology for their own usage – albeit by stripping out the more threatening, decentralized components.  There’s a straight line from Hanyecz’s bitcoin pizza purchase to JPM Coin, in other words.  As a community of users emerges around Lightning’s decentralized payments model, how will banks and other incumbent institutions respond?

The new ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit), called the BM1397, is said to provide improvements in performance, chip size and energy efficiency for mining proof-of-work cryptocurrencies based on the SHA256 algorithm, such as bitcoin (BTC) and bitcoin cash (BCH).  Made using a 7nm FinFET process from Bitmain chip supplier Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the BM1397 will gobble up less electricity than previous Bitmain offerings, offering an energy consumption to computing ratio ""as low as 30J/TH,"" according to an announcement Monday.  Bitmain said:  ""This is a 28.6 percent improvement in power efficiency in comparison with Bitmain’s previous 7nm chip, the BM1391. To achieve this, Bitmain’s engineering team has thoroughly customized the chip design to optimize its architecture, circuit and economics.""  The new ASIC will feature in new Antminer mining devices – the S17 and T17 – that Bitmain said it will detail at a later date.  The announcement comes soon after the mining giant revealed its most recent Antminers – the S15 and T15 – in November, both powered by the BM1391 ASIC.  Bitmain also launched ASIC miners for the cryptocurrencies zcash and ethereum last year. The development prompted ethereum's open-source development community to tentatively agree in January to implement a new algorithm that would restrict ASIC mining on the network, pending further testing of the required code, ProgPoW.  ProgPoW was delayed earlier this month, however, in favor of conducting audits to gauge the effectiveness of the method.

The Commodity Futures Trading Regulatory Agency (Bappebti), an agency under Indonesia's Ministry of Trade, announced the new rules Monday, stating that cryptocurrency futures exchanges must be registered and approved before operating.  The agency has also confirmed that crypto assets are officially recognized as commodities that can be traded on the country’s futures exchange – a decision first reported last June.  The agency's chief Indrasari Wisnu Wardhana said in Monday’s statement that the regulations have been put in place to provide legal certainty to the crypto futures sector, as well to protect consumers and investors.  In a document detailing the full rules and registration requirements, Bappebti said that futures exchanges and clearing houses dealing in crypto assets must have paid-up capital of at least 1.5 trillion Indonesian rupiahs ($106 million) and must maintain a closing capital balance of at least 1.2 trillion Indonesian rupiahs ($85 million).  They are also required to have ""good level of system security"" and a minimum of three employees who are Certified Information System Security Professionals (CISSP). They must also undergo a risk assessment process, the agency said, including confirming anti-money laundering (AML) and combating the financing of terrorism (CFT) compliance.  Bappebti has also set out rules for futures traders and storage services providers of crypto assets, stating that both must also be approved before operating and both must maintain minimum paid-up capital of 1 trillion Indonesian rupiahs ($71 million) and a minimum closing balance of 800 billion Indonesian rupiahs ($57 million).  The agency clarified that the new rules do not apply to initial coin offerings (ICOs). Using cryptocurrencies as a means of payment is reportedly still barred in the country.  According to Reuters, the country's crypto traders are unhappy that the watchdog has set the minimum capital so high, arguing it will hold back development of the nascent market.  The CEO of digital asset trader Indodax, Oscar Darmawan, told the news source that the “very large” capital requirement is above what is required for launching a rural bank and far higher than the 2.5 billion rupiah ($177,000) minimum paid-up capital for futures traders of more traditional commodities.

42381582,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9nLdP,1550487612,"Bitcoin Price Passes $3,700 to Hit One-Month High","View  Bitcoin jumped to one-month highs earlier today, validating the falling wedge breakout seen in the 4-hour chart on Friday.  The outlook as per the daily chart remains neutral, as the cryptocurrency is still trapped in a symmetrical triangle. That said, a break above the upper edge of the triangle, currently located at $3,760, looks likely as an inverse head-and-shoulders breakout on the 4-hour chart has opened up upside toward $4,030 (target as per the measured height method). More importantly, the rally to one-month highs is backed by strong volumes and a rise in long positions.  A symmetrical triangle breakout, if confirmed, would imply a bearish-to-bullish trend change on the daily chart.  A failure to cross the triangle resistance at $3,760 would weaken the bullish case. The focus would again shift to the recent lows near $3,300 if the support at $3,530 (low of the left shoulder) is breached.  Bitcoin's high-volume move to one-month highs could be the start of a stronger rally to above key resistance near $3,760.  The leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization rose to $3,727 at 07:00 UTC, the highest level since Jan. 19, according to Bitstamp data, validating Friday's falling wedge breakout.  With a move to levels above $3,700, bitcoin has also witnessed an inverse head-and-shoulders breakout on the 4-hour chart – indicating a bearish-to-bullish trend change – and has opened up upside toward $4,000.  On the way higher, however, BTC could encounter stiff resistance near $3,760 – the upper edge of a contracting triangle (higher lows and lower highs) carved out over the last eight weeks. A failure to take out that hurdle would weaken the short-term bullish case.  That said, BTC is likely to cross that resistance this week, as the rally to one-month highs is backed by a pickup in both trading volumes and long positions (bullish bets).  Bitcoin's 24-hour trading volume has jumped to highs above $8 billion for the first time since Dec. 20, according to CoinMarketCap data.  Further, BTC/USD longs on Bitfinex rose to 38,237 BTC earlier today – the highest level since March 30, 2018. Notably, long positions are still down at least 7 percent from record highs above 40,000 BTC witnessed in March last year. Therefore, the probability of a “long-squeeze” – a sudden price drop due to the unwinding of long positions – is quite low.  So, the odds of BTC confirming the contracting triangle breakout with a move above $3,760 appear high. As of writing, the cryptocurrency is changing hands at $3,700 on Bitstamp, representing a 3 percent gain on a 24-hour basis.  Daily chart  A bearish-to-bullish trend change on the daily chart would be confirmed if prices see a UTC close above the upper edge of the symmetrical triangle, currently at $3,760.  That looks likely as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) is currently located at 61.00, the highest level since September. Further, the 5- and 10-day moving averages (MAs) are trending north indicating a bullish setup.  4-hour chart  The inverse head-and-shoulders breakout seen in the 4-hour chart indicates scope for a rally to $4,030 (target as per the measured height method).  Key averages are beginning to align in favor of the bulls too. The 50-candle MA is now sloping upwards and the 100-candle MA looks set to cross the 200-candle MA from below forming a bullish crossover.  The RSI, however, is reporting overbought conditions. Hence, a minor bout of consolidation or pullback could be seen before the contracting triangle resistance at $3,760 is breached.

42381559,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9nLGl,1550483101,Craig Wright Claims to Be Satoshi in Critical Response to CFTC on Ethereum,"NChain chief scientist Craig Wright has criticized ethereum to a top U.S. regulator, while again claiming to be bitcoin's pseudonymous inventor, Satoshi Nakamoto.  In a response to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s (CFTC) request for input on crypto asset mechanics and markets, the Australian entrepreneur briefly set out his case that he is Nakamoto on Friday, saying:  ""My name is Dr. Craig Wright and under the pseudonym of Satoshi Nakamoto I completed a project I started in 1997 that was filed with the Australian government in part under an AusIndustry project registered with the Dept. of Innovation as BlackNet.""  Wright first put forward the case that he was bitcoin's creator in late December 2015, offering up documentation to back up the claim. Initial support from some quarters soon gave way to skepticism however, and he later said he would provide further evidence by moving bitcoin mined by Satoshi in the earliest days of the cryptocurrency. Days later he said he would not do so.  His claim remains controversial and is yet to be proven to the satisfaction of many in the crypto industry.  In his reply to the CFTC, Wright went on to make a strident critique of the technology and governance of blockchain and smart contract platform ethereum.  He said:  “Ethereum is a poorly designed copy of bitcoin designed with the purpose of completing the promise of smart contracts and scripting that were delivered within bitcoin but which were hobbled by the core developers of bitcoin who sought to enable anonymous transactions to exist within the system.”  Wright’s response follows a request for input from the CFTC in December, in which the agency is seeking public feedback on different questions about ethereum, ranging from its technology to how it’s used.  Wright further said that the ethereum network cannot scale and it has “already reached its computational limits,” adding:  “[It] is effectively only being used to raise capital using illegal bucket shops that are designed in such a way that they can deceive nontechnical parties.”  Bitcoin network, on the other hand, he said, can be set up in a way that allows “infinite scaling.” Bitcoin can “leave simple verifications on chain allowing a system that scales globally and delivering a distributed computational method,” he wrote.  The only way ethereum can scale is to alter its model to copy bitcoin, he added.  He also hit out at the governance model of ethereum, saying it's “controlled by one central group, who uses misleading statements saying that they are decentralized to cover up the fraudulent creation of a digital security.”  Wright also argued that decentralization is a myth, as the control of either bitcoin or ethereum is “limited to those who run nodes and these are people running at large data centers and not home networks.""  He concluded by saying he was ""willing to testify under oath"" as to his claims.  Twitter is, of course, buzzing about the CFTC response, with many skeptics calling for Wright to indeed prove his claim by moving Satoshi's bitcoin. A few suggest they believe Wright is indeed Satoshi.  Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson tweeted about Wright's latest Satoshi claim Sunday, writing:  ""So Sad; So Panda :(""  Last year, ethereum's inventor Vitalik Buterin called Wright a ""fraud"" during a South Korean event at which both were appearing.  Crypto exchanges Coinbase and ErisX and ethereum-focused startup Consensys, among others, have also recently responded to the CFTC's call for input.  Wright is currently fighting a lawsuit alleging that he misappropriated billions of dollars’-worth of bitcoin from the estate of a former business partner. The Australian is being sued by Ira Kleiman on behalf of the estate of his brother, the late Dave Kleiman, a forensic computer investigator and author, who passed away in 2013 following a battle with MRSA.

Inspired by a pre-existing scaling solution called plasma, Monoplasma is different in that it focuses specifically on “one-to-many payments"" in which users would need to ""repeatedly distribute value to a large and dynamic set of ethereum addresses,” explained Henri Pihkala, CEO of Streamr.  Speaking to CoinDesk about use cases for the technology, Pihkala said Monoplasma isn’t just about revenue sharing. Rather, the technology is envisioned for open-source decentralized applications (dapps) looking to incorporate “dividend distributions, staking rewards, repeated airdrops,” and more.  Demonstrating the power of Monoplasma on stage, Pihkala showed how the tool can be used to drop small amounts of fake ""unicorn"" tokens into 100,000 addresses on a test version of the ethereum blockchain.  Marketed as a ""special-purpose off-chain scaling solution,"" Shiv Malik, head of communications for Streamr, likened the technology to ""broadcasting money.""  ""You can receive money, but you can't send back the other way. That would be like trying to send a message to your TV,"" Malik said.  As such, no double spends – where tokens are essentially counterfeited – are able to occur on a Monoplasma payment channel. “On the side channel, you can only earn money,” emphasized Pihkala.    Unidirectional Monoplasma payments system. Image courtesy of Streamr.    Streamr intends to use the technology to crowdsell user data on a blockchain. Once data from users is sold to a bidding company, payment will directly be pushed into users’ ethereum addresses.  Revealed last May, Streamr has partnered with a number of tech conglomerates including Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Finnish telecom company Nokia.  Now, all ethereum developers are encouraged to try out Monoplasma by downloading the public code repository on GitHub.  Pihkala concluded:  “If someone else finds use in [Monoplasma] that's awesome, that's what makes us happy. But at the very least, we're going to build on top of it – meaning [Monoplasma] is going to be well maintained. It's not about to be abandoned anytime soon.""

42381577,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9nLYN,1550466053,"Brock Pierce, Mark Karpeles and the War of Words Over Mt Gox's Future","Brock Pierce wants Mt. Gox creditors to receive 100 percent of whatever they're owed – or so he says, anyway.  Weeks after announcing Gox Rising – his ambitious effort to unite the long-defunct exchange's creditors, submit a civil rehabilitation plan and relaunch the Mt Gox exchange itself – Pierce, a prominent crypto-entrepreneur, is walking back just how concrete these plans are.  He's also fought with former Mt Gox CEO and majority shareholder Mark Karpelès on Twitter about the feasibility of his plan and whether it's even legal.  Gox Rising was launched as an alternative to Mt Gox bankruptcy trustee Nobuaki Kobayashi's civil rehabilitation effort. Billed as a way to ensure creditors receive as much of their money as possible, the organization has published a proposed planhttps://goxrising.com/doc/Gox-Rising-CR-Pillars.pdf on its website, alongside a list of goals.  Two points, in particular, stand out: under the Gox Rising plan, no further bitcoins from Mt Gox's estate would be sold, and ""equity [holders] will make no claim on any of the cash held by the trustee,"" according to the proposal (more on both later).  Gox Rising comes after years of bankruptcy proceedings for the Mt Gox exchange, which collapsed in 2014 after the theft or disappearance of nearly a million bitcoins (though some 200,000 were later recovered).  Before its fall, Mt Gox was the world's first – and at one point, its largest – bitcoin exchange, conducting some 70 percent of all crypto transactions at its peak. When it first announced the loss of customer funds, the price of bitcoin tanked from $850 to $681, a nearly 20 percent drop at the time.  The exchange's shutdown did not help what was turning into a bear market, which saw bitcoin's price fall well below $400 over the next year, not beginning to recover until 2015.  Following Mt Gox's collapse, Japanese prosecutors indicted Karpelès in 2017 on charges of fabricating information about the exchange and embezzling $3 million in customer funds to his own account at the end of 2013. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges, with a verdict expected sometime next month. If convicted, he could face as much as a decade in prison.  Last year, the exchange shifted to civil rehabilitation proceedings rather than outright bankruptcy, meaning creditors will receive bitcoins distributed directly on a pro-rata basis, instead of a cash equivalent based on bitcoin's price at the time of the collapse.  Road to reopening  The crux of Gox Rising's plan is to create a central store of information for Mt Gox creditors, ensuring that they receive accurate information about its civil rehabilitation as proceedings progress, said Pierce.  ""Gox Rising is an initiative or movement to ensure creditors get what we believe is rightfully theirs. It’s an organization that’s selecting all of the information related to Mt Gox’s bankruptcy proceedings, aggregate that information so people know what’s going on,"" he explained in an interview.  He told CoinDesk that the plan begins with an effort to acquire the Mt Gox brand. Gox Rising has yet to submit any bids to do so, but Pierce claims his organization has been working with the Japanese bankruptcy court overseeing the exchange.  He initially intends to buy Mt Gox's ""intangible assets,"" meaning its domain and brand, pending court approval.  After that, Pierce has a three-part plan. The first part is to take stock of how much remains in terms of fiat and bitcoin holdings and share that information with creditors, as well as distribute funds as quickly as possible. Part two involves relaunching the exchange itself, giving creditors some level of ownership.  It's the final part that is by far the most ambitious: an effort to try and recover somewhere between 650,000 and 850,000 BTC that remain missing.  ""The question is can any of those coins be recovered. Maybe? We certainly have better tools today than we previously had to track down those coins,"" Pierce said, though he did not go into detail when asked if his team has had any success in tracking the missing bitcoin thus far.  Who's the boss?  However, questions remain over who actually owns the Mt Gox platform and its assets.  As of the beginning of 2014, the exchange's two shareholders were Karpelès, who owned 88 percent of the company, and Jed McCaleb (who would go on to co-found Ripple and then Stellar), who held the remaining 12 percent. Pierce claims he bought them both out, but Karpelès insists neither purchase was legally finalized.  In the case of McCaleb's shares, Karpeles argues the sale required approval from Japan's bankruptcy courts. Pierce denies this.  ""Jed McCaleb is of the opinion that we own the 12 percent, that is his current position as of this week. That has not changed over the past five years, there is no dispute,"" Pierce said, adding:  ""The sale was done prior to the courts so the courts may just have bad info. If Jed McCaleb is saying 'yes, I haven’t owned these shares in five years and yes, I sold them to Brock,' the courts can say whatever they want. We just haven’t bothered to go file anything.""  McCaleb did not respond to a request for comment from CoinDesk by press time.  While Karpelès did sign a letter of intent outlining terms for a possible sale of his Mt Gox shares to Pierce, he later sent a second letter rescinding the first, citing the fact that the Tokyo District Court did not approve any sale. Pierce did not sign the second letter.  Still, on Twitter earlier this week, Pierce said Karpelès ""knows"" he sold his 88 percent of Mt Gox to Pierce (Karpelès disputed this assessment).  However, Pierce was less certain when speaking to CoinDesk, explaining that while his U.S. counsel was confident that Pierce owned Karpelès' shares in the exchange, he was waiting for his Japanese counsel to confirm.  For his part, Karpelès told CoinDesk via email that ""the trustee confirmed to me [Mt Gox's ownership] hasn't changed and [is] still the same,"" meaning Tibanne, Karpelès' company, owns 88 percent of Mt Gox shares and Jed McCaleb owns the other 12 percent.  Kobayashi did not respond to a request for comment by press time.  Despite his insistence that he is the sole owner of Mt Gox, Pierce emphasized repeatedly that ""we don't care who owns the equity of Mt Gox,"" but only ""that the creditors get 100 percent"" of their funds back.  Surplus funds  Part of the fight stems from a potential surplus of funds which may benefit shareholders. This surplus was created by selling bitcoins at their market value during the 2017 bull run, well above what they were worth when Gox was still in business. (The trustee ceased these sales after Gox entered civil rehabilitation.)  As a result, Pierce told CoinDesk, Karpelès might receive $700 million through the Tibanne bankruptcy, as it's the bankruptcy trustee's job to ""get that money."" He's repeated this claim online as well.  ""We want to make sure Mark Karpelès doesn't get any of it,"" he added.  Karpelès, on the other hand, said he does not anticipate getting any funds paid through the Tibanne bankruptcy.  ""Expecting money from a bankruptcy as a shareholder is typically nonsense, and the possibility only appeared because of the very unique circumstances the Mt Gox bankruptcy was in,"" he said. Given that Mt Gox is now in civil rehabilitation, rather than pursuing bankruptcy proceedings, ""there is definitely no chance"" of shareholders receiving any funds.  Pierce did acknowledge that the change in status might affect whether Karpelès receives any funds, saying that ""the bankruptcy trustee publicly stated that the owner of Mt Gox would be entitled to whatever the surplus was ... now that it's in civil rehabilitation, that may not be the case.""  He further added, however, that Karpelès is the ""only person who cares about who owns"" Mt Gox, saying:  ""From our perspective it's irrelevant ... Karpelès is the one bringing it up and he cares a great deal because you know, he might be going to prison for 10 years, his sentencing is in March, and I imagine he'd be much more comfortable in prison with $700 million to his name than nothing.""  Goxcoin?  Still, if Pierce is granted control of the Mt Gox brand and domain, he hopes to relaunch the platform with creditors' buy-in.  In the interview with CoinDesk, Pierce outlined how creditors would sign up and share in profits from the exchange.  ""It would start out as a contract and it would most likely end up as a security token,"" he said, noting his previous work with the asset type. ""I started the first-ever security token at [Blockchain Capital] and I used to run a top 10 syndicate on AngelList … I know quite a bit about security tokens.""  He likened the prospective token to one issued by Bitfinex after that exchange was hacked in 2016. At the time, Bitfinex issued customers debt tokens representing their losses, which it bought back over the next year.  Further down the line, the token's structure may change (to something more similar to Binance's BNB token), though details are still to be determined, Pierce said. Despite his plans, however, he said he does not know when he might file a bid, though he hopes to have a clearer timeline in the coming days.  The delay stems from the fact that he has counsel in the U.S. and Japan trying to coordinate, he said. The vastly different time zones are effectively slowing down proceedings, though Pierce hopes to file his bid for the Mt Gox domain ""soon.""  As for the ongoing civil rehabilitation efforts, ""hopefully [the current plan under the bankruptcy trustee] will cover all the things that matter,"" he said, adding:  ""So unless we have a reason to believe that plan is not going to provide creditors with with they should have, there’s no reason for us to file a CR plan. The only reason is if there’s a problem with the CR plan.""  Karpelès was less confident about Pierce's motivations, saying he ""doubt[s]"" that Pierce does not also see a benefit for himself.  In particular, Pierce's belief that there is ""some sort of surplus payout"" for shareholders makes Karpelès think that Pierce is keeping something behind, and ""that it's probably not going to be good for creditors.""  ""Creditors have done an extraordinary job of putting Mt Gox in civil rehabilitation and are still fighting for their rights by proposing changes to the trustee's rehabilitation plan, and I do not believe they need someone to step in now and claim all the credit while trying to profit from the situation,"" he said.

Read his latest remarks here.    --------    Ethereum core developer Afri Schoedon is taking a step back from the project due to an onslaught of online criticism.  Tweeting  Sunday that he will ""no longer respond on Gitter, Skype, Discord, Slack, Wire, Twitter and Reddit,"" Schoedon said that for the foreseeable future he would no longer answer contribution requests or general technical questions directly from the public. He later said that this effectively marks his exit from the project entirely.  Having contributed to the ethereum codebase since 2015, the comments have inspired responses from other developers who are outraged over the actions that led to his decision.  ""I'm so angry and disappointed in the Ethereum community. You ran out one of our best contributors for the dumbest reasons. More people should have spoken up in support and there needs to be less vitriol,"" stated community relations manager for the Ethereum Foundation Hudson Jameson on Twitter.  The comments follow Schoedon's frank remarks Thursday in which he compared ethereum scaling technology Serenity and blockchain interoperability protocol Polkadot.  He wrote on Twitter: ""'Polkadot delivers what Serenity ought to be.' Change my mind.""  Taken by some as a targeted attack against ethereum that undermines the blockchain platform's value, Schoedon was called out on Twitter and Reddit for what some perceived as a ""conflict of interest.""  Schoedon is the release manager for an ethereum software client managed by blockchain startup Parity, the company concurrently building Polkadot. Denying allegations of any malicious intent, Schoedon tweeted on Friday: ""I want to clarify that I put out this tweet to stir discussion, not to cement a narrative.""  All tweets by Schoedon since June 2017 have now been deleted, save for the two he posted Sunday explaining his future absence from ethereum.  Since then, director of developer relations for the Ethereum Classic Cooperative Yaz Khoury warned on Twitter that ""this mob behavior against Afri and Parity [Technologies] is the result of toxic tribalism,"" adding:  ""Ethereum is a technology with many implementations and visions ... The diversity of networks is powerful.""  Correction: Schoedon's contributions to ethereum as reflected on Github dates back to 2015, not 2017 as originally stated.

42381570,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9nLQp,1550455234,"Crypto Securities Are Years Away from Mainstream, Technologists Say","Despite a growing mainstream interest in the use of crypto assets and blockchains as a way to replicate and represent securities, some of the use case's earliest innovators say sky-high expectations may not be in line with reality.  For example, during a panel discussion at the ethereum conference ETHDenver this weekend, Tal Elyashiv – co-founder and managing partner of blockchain venture capital firm SPiCE VC, one of the first to release a crypto security under existing U.S. securities laws as a way to offer immediate liquidity for its venture fund – said the concept still remains very much ""in its infancy.""  Elyashiv remarked that when it comes to tokenized securities, the infrastructure in place to see it reach its full potential has not yet fully developed.  ""We're going to start to see major pieces of the business infrastructure coming within the next few years ... We'll start to see institutional investors coming in this year,"" said Elyashiv.  Joined by COO of security token advisory firm Satis Group Shala Burroughs, director digital asset services of crowd equity platform Republic Frederick Allen and CPO of security tokens trading platform OpenFinance Thomas McInerney, Elyashiv was not alone in asserting a more cautious projection.  ""When you talk about a security token, it's a token representing a security. It's not just a name. It means not just what the token is but how the whole process is managed ... throughout its lifetime,"" added Elyashiv.  Regulatory uncertainty regarding how such tokens could be issued at scale, Elyashiv says, will likely persist for ""give or take a year"" as government officials at the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) come to a clear distinction between security tokens and other forms of crypto assets that, like bitcoin, function as commodities.  Until then, Burroughs cautioned investors greet with caution any exaggerated statements on the present maturity of the security tokens industry.  She said:  ""If you're seeing articles that are reporting this vast ground swell of money into this industry, that's not really in line with exact reality. It'll take a few years for us to get there.""
