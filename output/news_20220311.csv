Yuga Labs and Larva Labs made a joint announcement on Twitter on Friday evening.  ""We now own the brands, copyright in the art and other IP rights for both collections, along with 423 CryptoPunks and 1711 Meebits,"" reads Yuga Labs' blog post.  Larva Labs says it will retain the rights to its other big non-fungible token (NFT) collection, Autoglyphs, ""as well as a group of our favorite Punks and Meebs.""  Bored Ape Yacht Club is the most valuable NFT collection in crypto; CryptoPunks are the second most valuable.  Yuga Labs also says it plans to grant the commercial rights to all CryptoPunk and Meebit images to their respective owners. The company has already done this for Bored Ape owners – Yuga Labs owns the Bored Ape Yacht Club, but each token holder is free to monetize their specific ape. Holders have used that idea to spin off their own NFT collections based on particular apes, or to sign their apes with major record labels.

In a FAQ on whether Russia-related sanctions extend to virtual currency, the department wrote that “U.S. persons, including virtual currency exchanges, virtual wallet hosts, and other service providers, such as those that provide nested services for foreign exchanges, are generally prohibited from engaging in or facilitating prohibited transactions, including virtual currency transactions in which blocked persons have an interest.”  The FAQ said that U.S. persons are also barred from engaging in or facilitating prohibited transactions by a non-U.S. person, “including virtual currency transactions involving the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, National Wealth Fund of the Russian Federation, or the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation.”  U.S. financial institutions are also generally prohibited from processing transactions, including virtual currency transactions, involving targeted financial institutions.  The Biden administration and G7 group of nations said earlier on Friday that such guidance on crypto transactions with respect to sanctions would be forthcoming.  The new guidance comes shortly after after U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) announced she was drafting a bill to prevent Russian oligarchs or President Vladimir Putin from using crypto to evade sanctions.

One of these is WhaleAlerts, a bot that tracks large transactions across various blockchains and recently, a number of large transactions have shown whales may be accumulating.

13400409,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/?p=229273,1647039608,Curve Protocol : Leading DEX for Stablecoins,"USDC, USDT, BUSD, PAX, TrueUSD, and DAI are all examples of stablecoins that have recently gained popularity. They have an issue with price stability and liquidity (particularly decentralized stablecoins). When MakerDAO reduced its stability charge to 5.5 percent, many customers of Compound (which had an interest rate of 11 percent at the time) decided to stay because they had taken out a loan in DAI and changing DAI to USDC is a costly procedure. At the same time, many DeFi users are eager to lend their stablecoins in exchange for a 5% APR, which is far higher than what traditional banking gives. Users would be hesitant to provide the same money to trading firms that guarantee profits. Curve Finance addresses the issue of lack of liquidity while trading Stablecoins and high costs. Introduction Curve Finance uses liquidity pools and bonding curves to enable high-efficiency stablecoin trading and low-risk rewards for liquidity providers. When trading from one stablecoin to another on Curve, customers are not vulnerable to the price slippage on DEXs. Curve, unlike Uniswap, lends assets on Compound when they aren&apos;t being traded and pays liquidity providers interest on those loans. Curve was created as an alternative to trading stablecoins on general-purpose DEXes like Uniswap, which have algorithms that aren&apos;t designed for such transactions. Curve&apos;s debut resulted in increased liquidity and more competitive prices for stablecoins...",POSITIVE,DAI | USDC,BLOCKCHAIN | TRADING | UNI | DAI | USDC,,0,0,Cryptoknowmics,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/curve-protocol-leading-dex-for-stablecoins/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png

Speculative assets such as stocks, cryptos and commodities have experienced sharp price moves over the past month, indicating a high degree of uncertainty among investors.  Bitcoin (BTC) rose as much as 7% during the London trading day after Russian President Vladimir Putin said there was “positive movement” in negotiations. Still, price gains were short-lived as warfare between Russia and Ukraine intensified on Friday.  Regulatory crackdowns on crypto also added to a sour mood among traders. On Friday, Reuters reported that several crypto firms based in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have been hit with a flood of requests by Russian clients to liquidate billions of dollars' worth of digital assets.  Also, the White House and Group of 7 industrial nations announced fresh sanctions against Russia Friday and specified that guidance on using crypto to evade sanctions will be released soon.  ""Near-run uncertainty will stay elevated until a lasting Ukraine cease-fire is in sight. This is directionally bearish for equities and credit, but conditions are hitting oversold levels,"" MRB Partners, an investment research firm, wrote in a report this week. MRB expects a relief rally in stocks if war-related conditions ease.  Bitcoin could eventually follow a recovery path in stocks given the rising correlation between those two kinds of assets.

The underperformance of ETH and several other alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins), which are more volatile than BTC, indicates a lower appetite for risk among crypto investors.  ""The ETH/BTC cross has continued to trend lower to 0.066. Since early February, we have seen an 8% decline in the ETH/BTC cross, which we often use as a risk barometer for crypto assets more broadly,"" Coinbase Institutional wrote in an email on Friday. ""What it seems to be telling us is that risk appetite away from the perceived 'safe havens' of the asset class (mainly BTC) is still somewhat low.""  The chart below shows that the ETH/BTC price ratio is below its 40-week moving average, which is similar to what occurred during the 2018 crypto bear market.  Altcoin roundup  Big short on tether: Fir Tree Capital Management, a hedge fund with $4 billion in assets under management, has made a sizable short bet against the stablecoin tether (USDT), according to a Bloomberg report on Friday. The position was structured as an ""asymmetric trade,"" meaning the downside risk is small and the potential payoff is large, the firm's clients say. Read more here.  Altcoin trading volume dips: Trading activity on the Coinbase has been concentrated among ""safe haven"" tokens such as BTC and ETH over the past week. ""Further out the risk curve – even in higher profile coins like SOL and ADA – demand has dropped off as they are still trying to find viable support levels,"" Coinbase wrote in a report on Friday. The exchange also noted that trading activity in meme coins such as SHIB has declined along with weak social media engagement.  LUNA's good week: Terra's LUNA token is up 11% over the past week, outperforming some larger cryptocurrencies amid the war in Ukraine. ""It's the third week in a row that LUNA has secured double-digit positive returns, prompting investors to wonder how sustainable this rally is,"" Guillermo Avilés, an analyst at Messari, wrote in a Friday newsletter. LUNA is down 5% over the past 24 hours, indicating a loss of upside momentum.

42395787,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASzTfr,1647032893,Evmos Looks to Get Back on Track After Failed Launch,"Numerous bugs and false starts have tarnished the luster on one of the most eagerly anticipated chain launches in recent memory, but the team responsible is hoping to right the ship.  Last Wednesday, Evmos – an EVM-compatible chain allowing for cross-blockchain transactions between Ethereum and Cosmos – launched their mainnet featuring an ambitious token airdrop and token-economic structure.  Read more: Evmos Looks to Jump-Start Ethereum–Cosmos Interoperability With Airdrop, Mainnet Launch  The launch was riddled with bugs, however, with many users reporting problems due to the unusually large number of hardware and software wallet integrations that the chain can theoretically support.  Additionally, two days after the launch of the chain, a “critical security vulnerability” forced the Evmos team to rush a fix that validators failed to properly implement, ultimately leading to a chain pause on Saturday.  Evmos – which Zaki Manian, former director at Cosmos developer Tendermint Labs, noted in an interview with CoinDesk is entirely community-funded and a largely community-run effort – still has an opportunity to recapture the excitement with a functional second launch, Manian argued.  “I suspect the momentum story is the same. My sense of things, observing the repos and being part of the triage groups, this is still exactly what Cosmos needs,” Manian said.  Gradual breakdown  Even before the full chain failure, Evmos’ launch was plagued with problems related to the unusually high number of integrations the team needed to facilitate.  “We have a few user experience bugs that got in the way of the airdrop and the launch. And there were users that were following incorrect guides for claiming, and their funds got stuck – that was on us because we should have been preparing for users using [blockchain wallets] Kepler and Ledger,” said Evmos founder Frederico Kunze Küllmer in an interview with CoinDesk.  The primary problem reared its head shortly before the weekend, however.  “On Friday afternoon, I got a message from the core IBC team at Interchain saying that there was a potential vulnerability in the code, and that we should not create LP pools on Osmosis because of this vulnerability,” said Kunze Küllmer.  The team was working on upgrades to the UI bugs at the time and initially assumed that the vulnerability was related to these comparatively minor issues.  The next day, however, when the IBC team sent over additional information, Kunze Küllmer recognized it as a “critical security vulnerability” that would require a planned upgrade with network validators.  The team developed a fix and distributed the upgrade to validators on Sunday, but the implementation of the upgrade failed, causing the current chain freeze. According to a postmortem, the validators and the team collectively decided to halt efforts to restart the chain on Monday.  “I think we underestimated the importance of testing against all of these tools. We’re trying to create this unique user experience, bringing Ethereum into Cosmos and Cosmos into Ethereum, and because of this we had a larger surface area to cover – not just the chain having multiple bugs, but for the tools being ready to handle both ecosystems at the same time,” said Kunze Küllmer.  Market reaction  Prior to the failed launch, Evmos was widely anticipated to be a success, even in currently adverse market conditions.  As a result, the social media backlash to the botched start has been harsh.  However, among the Cosmos developer community, there have been signs of optimism.  “To non-Cosmos people, this looks like a mess. To Cosmos people, this was a near miss,” Manian said. “This was an opportunity to dive in and see what was actually going on, what was built and how this thing was actually supposed to work, and I think most people’s response has been, ‘Oh, this was 95% there.‘”  Indeed, in spite of the airdrop claim failures and chain halt, there is reportedly a thriving OTC market for Evmos tokens.  Kunze Küllmer told CoinDesk that the team has been “shocked” by the amount of interest in the currently useless asset.  The market is even playing into a key decision the team now faces: whether or not to restart the Evmos chain from scratch, or attempt to salvage the chain history.  The team is currently analyzing legal liabilities as well as performing forensics on whether or not the existing history has any bugs or flaws, and the expectation of economic finality from traders is playing into the decision making process.  “It’s not the ethos of a blockchain – the immutability of code-as-law. It’s also going to affect OTC trading, the history of transactions that weren’t able to claim. We’re outlining all the pros and cons right now,” said Kunze Küllmer.  In the end, however, there’s a risk current traders will be left in the lurch.  “There’s 45,000 EVMOS sitting on Cosmos right now – if they reset the chain state, owners will have a cool collector’s item, Evmos Classic,” Manian quipped.  Next steps  Currently the team is working through a lengthy list of remediation items outlined in the disclosure blog post.  Additionally, Kunze Küllmer said that one current focus is creating guides for complex Cosmos chain upgrades “to ensure no other teams across the ecosystem suffer this again.”  Kunze Küllmer also said that he believes a successful relaunch can recapture the initial excitement percolating around Evmos, and Manian likewise said that the product still fulfills a major need in the Cosmos ecosystem.  “This is almost there – we have a lot of confidence this is the thing that Cosmos wants, which is an EVM on Cosmos,” Manian said. “The number of teams that have tried to climb this mountain and given up – in some senses this project is five years old, and we believe Evmos is going to be the team that conquers this mountain.”  While Kunze Küllmer declined to venture a possible timeline for the relaunch of the chain, Manian said that it could come as early as next week.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | MINING | AIRDROP,Andrew Thurman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/03/11/evmos-looks-to-get-back-on-track-after-failed-launch,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/74101dcc7e5bdc0207b4af653b290c083c5bed5e-720x406.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A close above $14.5 may accelerate the recovery, pushing prices towards $20 in the medium term. Past Performance It has been a challenging three months for Chainlink bulls as per the LINKUSDT candlestick arrangement in the daily chart. At spot rates, LINK has reversed all gains posted in H2 2021, shrinking 65 percent from 2021 peaks. Although bears appear to be in control, Chainlink has been flat-lining at around $12, tethering at near 2022 lows. Chainlink Technical Analysis After deep retracements, sellers are still in control, pinning Chainlink prices at 2022 lows. The immediate support is at $12. While LINKUSDT consolidates horizontally, there must be a sharp close above the middle BB—the 20-day moving average—and $14.5, confirming gains of March 9 for possible bullish resumption. A close above $14.5 may trigger demand, lifting LINK towards $16 and later $19 as LINKUSDT bottoms up above critical liquidation levels.

42410920,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggtGlV,1647029593,"Bitcoin Miners’ February Production Fell on Shorter Month, Winter Storm","North American crypto miners mined a lower number of bitcoins in February compared to the previous month, mainly because February is a shorter month and because some mining operations had to curtail operations due to winter weather, according to data compiled by CoinDesk. A higher hashrate and difficulty also dampened the output.  Among the top seven North American publicly traded miners, on average, bitcoin production fell about 8.6%, with Marathon Digital (MARA) lagging its peers. Meanwhile, the group of miners continued to increase their hashrate in February. According to the February data, the miners increased their hashrate by about 6% in February from the previous month, with Riot Blockchain (RIOT) adding the most among the group.  Marathon Digital said in a statement that main reasons for the decline was “network difficulty, continued fluctuations at the power station in Montana, and voluntary curtailment of our miners in Texas to support the grid during a recent storm.”  However, the miner noted that it expects monthly production to improve as the company diversifies its miners’ deployment across new locations and forecasted that it would remain on track to reach its hashrate goal of 23.3 exahash per second (EH/s) by early 2023.  Fewer days to mine  One of the main reasons for the lower bitcoin production in the U.S. was that there are fewer days in the month of February. For example, miner CleanSpark’s (CLSK) bitcoin production fell about 10% to 276. The miner said it reached a production rate as high as 10.15 BTC per day, which indicates that at such a production rate, the total would’ve been close to January production of more than 300, if there were 30 or 31 days in the month.  Another miner, Hive Blockchain (HIVE), also saw about an 8% reduction to 244 BTC in February. The miner said that it was producing an average of 8.7 BTC per day and at that rate, if the month had 30 or 31 days, it would have been able to reach production similar to January's.  “North American public mining companies mined ~2,890 new BTC in February (~11.6% share of total BTC mining network), ~9.7% less than in January,” Jefferies analyst Jonathan Petersen wrote in a March 9 research note. “The decrease in mining was due almost entirely to February having 28 days vs. 31 days,” he added.  U.S. winter storms take a toll on bitcoin mining  In February, miners were also hit by winter storms in the U.S., which saw several companies, mainly in Texas, curtailing some of their operations to help stabilize the power grid. Marathon Digital, Riot Blockchain, Rhodium, Argo Blockchain (ARBK) and other miners curtailed some of their U.S. operations to help the power grid stay online during the winter storm.  Recently, Argo and privately held Gem Mining both said the curtailing of operations to support community needs for extra power lowered their production in February, among other reasons. Meanwhile, seasonal energy curtailment programs in Quebec, Canada, also hampered the monthly bitcoin production for Canadian miner Bitfarms (BITF). “As planned, seasonal energy curtailment programs at our farms in Quebec affected production in February, but to a lesser extent than in January,” said CEO of Bitfarms, Emiliano Grodzki, in a statement.  The disruption of business by the winter storm is not new to this year for the miners. In fact, last year’s outage left about 4.5 million homes and businesses without power and led to nearly $200 billion in property damage. At that time, bitcoin miners’ operations also went offline, but it was unplanned. This year the situation was much better as miners helped stabilize the power during the storm with their planned shutdowns.  Hashrate and difficulty  The third event that hurt the miners’ production in February was the rise in the Bitcoin network’s hashrate and difficulty. “On February 1, Bitcoin’s 7-day average hashrate was 191 EH/s. By February 17, this would leap to 220 EH/s, a 15% increase,” according to a blog post by Hashrate Index, Luxor Technologies’ data platform.  This rise in hashrate resulted in about a 4.8% increase in difficulty for February, according to their data. “Bitcoin miners were hashing under an all-time high difficulty for roughly half of the month, so they were earning fewer bitcoins per unit of hashrate,” the blog post added.  Subsequently, the difficulty declined in March by about 1.5% and hashrate was around 192 EH/s, according to Hashrate Index data, which is potentially a positive development for the miners for this month.  Hashrate race and bitcoin profitability  Even though the miners earned less bitcoin in February, the race to grow hashrate by the miners hasn't subsided. In fact, they continued adding more mining rigs, as evidenced by the February data, and will continue to do so to stay competitive.  In February, Riot raised its hashrate the most out of the group, by about 15% to 3.9 EH/s, as it has deployed approximately 5,800 S19j Pro miners in its immersion-cooled building since January. The miner said it expects to have a total of 12.8 EH/s by January of 2023.  The largest miner by hashrate in North America, Core Scientific, also increased its self-mined hashrate by 9% from January and indicated that it will see its total (self-mined and hosted) hashrate rise from 40 EH/s to 42 EH/s by end of 2022.  Adding more overall mining power to secure Bitcoin is likely to continue, as miners have already committed to grow their hashrate over the course of this year. “We expect this rate of growth for the network hashrate (~8-9% monthly) to continue through FY22 despite the recent dip in BTC price because most of the larger mining companies have already placed the orders for the equipment they intend to deploy this year,” according to Jefferies’ Petersen.  He added that the average network hashrate increased by about 14 EH/s in February, and he expects about 5 EH/s to 10 EH/s of mining power to be brought online each month on average, if the North American public miners meet their 2022 hashrate targets. “However, it's also possible we could see even higher hashrate growth as certain technical innovations in the space come to fruition during the year,” he noted, citing new technologies such as immersion cooling and updated mining chips.  On the other hand, given the supply-chain constraints currently plaguing the industry, miners could fall short on reaching their expected hashrate addition this year, Hashrate Index cautioned. “With recent supply chain constraints and new power expansion delays among many of the public miners, though, there are no guarantees these companies will be able to achieve their promised hashrate expansion targets in 2022,” blog post said.  However, despite rising competition, network difficulty and bitcoin price off its peak, mining remains a very profitable business.

42394545,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bwBXhX,1647028492,How Authorities Track Criminal Crypto Transactions,"One of the biggest draws of transacting value using cryptocurrencies versus fiat currency like the U.S. dollar is the pseudonymity crypto provides. While all transactions sent over the blockchain are completely transparent, immutable and accessible to everyone, the identities of the people making those transfers are often presented as a string of alpha-numeric code known as a crypto wallet public key.  This makes forensic investigation difficult for government agencies, sub-contracted cybersecurity firms or anyone trying to isolate the senders and recipients of crypto assets from nefarious activities.  Just as the crypto market has matured over the years, so, too, have the techniques and tools used to track down the owners of specific crypto wallets.  How do criminals hide their crypto transactions?  Because of the transparent nature of the way crypto transactions are stored on public blockchains, the only option available to cybercriminals is to try and complicate the process of ascertaining wallet addresses and crypto funds, or offload their assets as quickly as possible.  This can be done using a variety of different methods.  Crypto mixers  Crypto mixing services allow users to deposit their assets into a pool and withdraw the same amount out. During this process each user will receive a mixture of different coins than what they deposited, obfuscating the origin of their funds.  Centralized mixers like Blender.io take users’ deposits and hand them back the same amount of funds in exchange for a fee, whereas decentralized mixers like JoinMarket will utilize mixing protocols like CoinJoin and allow users to mix their coins among each other.  Layering transactions  Layering refers to the practice of disguising funds by sending hundreds of transactions through multiple intermediary wallet addresses. These eventually combine into a final single transfer. In some instances, creating an entanglement of addresses like this can slow down the identification process, buying the criminal time to withdraw funds before their addresses are blacklisted. You can think of layering as creating a haystack to hide a needle.  Peer-to-peer transactions  A popular way of cashing out stolen crypto is to sell the funds for cash via a peer-to-peer arrangement. This circumvents the know-your-customer and anti-money laundering checks present on centralized exchanges and payment platforms and offloads the tainted crypto funds onto someone else.  Peel chain  A peel chain is a process whereby a criminal initiates a string of transactions. Each time funds are moved from one intermediary wallet to the next, a small portion of the funds is “peeled” away from the overall amount and cashed out or exchanged for a different cryptocurrency using different centralized exchanges.  Let’s say 100 bitcoin (BTC) have been stolen via an exchange hack. A peel chain could be initiated whereby 0.01 bitcoin is peeled each time the funds are sent along to the next wallet address. In this way, it would require 10,000 transactions before the original amount was completely withdrawn.  Cashing out small amounts of crypto avoids arousing suspicion with centralized exchanges and will be less likely to trigger reporting requirements.  How illicit crypto transactions get traced  According to New York-based private investigation agency Hudson Intelligence, there are two main forensic techniques involved in pinning down the owner of a particular wallet address or set of wallet addresses:  Identification of common spending patterns  Address reuse  Both techniques focus on a similar objective – isolating specific crypto wallet addresses that are assumed to belong to the culprit from a sea of other crypto wallet addresses.  Common spend  Common spend refers to the process of using several different crypto wallet addresses to send a single transaction to a recipient address. You can think of it as paying for a meal in a restaurant using 10 different credit or debit cards.  Just as it’s unlikely nine people would lend their debit or credit cards to a tenth person to use, it’s assumed the multiple input wallet addresses all belong to the same person.  Using multiple input addresses in this manner typically requires shared access to their passwords, or private keys. People rarely relinquish their private keys to strangers, for the same reasons they protect their login credentials for online banking.  To expedite the process of identifying these types of layered transactions – which would otherwise take considerable effort to do manually – blockchain analytic firms like Chainalysis and CipherTrace have created tools that scan for common spending patterns automatically.  By using this technique it is possible to ascertain how many wallets a criminal controls from a single transaction that might’ve occurred after a hack, rug pull or any type of unlawful cyber activity was perpetrated. Not only does this help narrow down the focus but, in certain circumstances, exchanges or payment providers may be called upon to blacklist the addresses to prevent the stolen assets from being withdrawn into fiat currency.  Address reuse  Another way of attributing cryptocurrency addresses to an individual is by scanning the blockchain for reused addresses – that is, crypto wallet addresses used more than once in a string of transactions.  Sometimes, digital assets will be transferred multiple times from one wallet to another in a loop-like cycle and a particular wallet address will be reused as the output address to complete the transfer. Identifying the reused output addresses allows a blockchain investigator to hone in on a perpetrator’s wallet address. It’s also assumed several wallets used prior to the output address are also likely to be under their control.  These addresses become reference points and help filter out external addresses which might belong to mixing services, exchanges or payment providers.  What happens when illicit crypto funds are withdrawn into fiat?  In the event the person(s) under investigation successfully withdraws the stolen crypto assets into fiat currency, it then becomes a matter of co-operating with exchanges and law enforcement to identify key personal information that can assist with apprehending the culprit(s).  “When proceeds from illicit activity are found to have been deposited into customer accounts at major cryptocurrency exchanges, law enforcement will notify the exchanges in an effort to freeze accounts and recover funds.” Says John Powers, president of Hudson Intelligence LLC.  “Law enforcement frequently obtains other useful information from exchanges, such as a list of linked accounts (including bank accounts used for external transfers), or copies of passports and identity documents provided by the customer when they created the account.”  This allows law enforcement to freeze bank accounts, block passports and track any vehicles linked to the target(s).  Despite the advancements in technology and tracing techniques, the process of identifying and preventing criminal crypto activity remains incredibly difficult. Improved cooperation among centralized platforms and greater regulatory oversight over mixing services and peer-to-peer trading platforms will be paramount in tackling the laundering of illicit funds through blockchain networks.

42375152,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw5qlP,1647022486,Biden's Executive Order on Crypto Receives Bipartisan Praise,"U.S. lawmakers across the political aisle are praising President Joe Biden’s executive order on digital assets.  Biden unveiled the sweeping directive on Wednesday, ordering different parts of the federal government to coordinate their efforts to craft guidance for the rapidly growing industry, but refraining from setting specific policy objectives beyond consumer protection, responsible innovation and financial stability.  White House press secretary Jen Psaki described the order as “the first-ever whole-of-government approach” to digital assets, noting that it also focuses on climate and national security concerns.  Read more: Here's the Full Text of Biden's Executive Order on Cryptocurrency  Both Democrat and Republican lawmakers have praised the effort.  Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), the ranking member on the Senate Banking Committee, said he was “encouraged” by the administration’s acknowledgement of the sector and its growth. “As the White House itself stated, the U.S. must maintain its leadership in this space, which is why lawmakers and regulators should do nothing to harm America’s long-standing tradition of fostering technological innovation,” he said.  Toomey further noted that the order directs departments to report their findings on certain issues to Congress, which “underscores the need for [the legislative branch] to enact a regulatory framework specific to digital assets.”  Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), chairman of the banking committee, similarly praised the order, saying it is “imperative we strengthen our financial resilience and national security right now."" Preventing bad actors from using cryptocurrencies to evade the law is one such priority, he said.  “The president is right to take a whole-of-government approach to addressing cryptocurrencies and considering a central bank digital currency,"" Brown added. ""I look forward to working with the administration and my colleagues in Congress to protect consumers, expand financial inclusion and safeguard our national security.""  Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, called the directive “an important step” in understanding how the digital asset sector might shape the financial system and American society. She praised the call for further research into a central bank digital currency in particular, saying that people turned to crypto as an alternative to the financial system during the COVID-19 pandemic.  “With working families across the country looking to rebuild from the pandemic by turning to financial alternatives like cryptocurrency, ensuring that people are not vulnerable to fraud, manipulation and abuse is imperative,"" she said, noting also that her committee has already held a number of hearings on digital assets.  Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), the ranking member on the House committee, echoed Toomey’s comments on Congress’ role in regulating digital assets. He called for bipartisan policies, saying that lawmakers from both major political parties have already begun looking at these issues.  “As Congress contemplates regulatory frameworks for digital assets, we must also fully acknowledge their benefits – like the important role they have played in ushering aid to Ukrainians – and their underlying technologies, which is largely missing in this announcement,” McHenry said.  He also pushed back against claims that crypto might be used by the Russian government or oligarchs to evade sanctions.  Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), a member of the Senate Banking Committee, has called on the Treasury Department to clarify how it will prevent crypto from being used as a tool to evade sanctions. In response to Biden’s executive order, she tweeted that she had “been ringing the bell on crypto,” reiterating these concerns.  Regulators respond  Regulators who will be entrusted with actually implementing the executive order broadly spoke to the need for either supporting “responsible” innovation or preventing malicious actors from defrauding the innocent.  Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman Rostin Behnam, who has lobbied Congress to give his agency crypto spot market oversight authority, said the order will “ensure greater cooperation” among independent market regulators, prudential (bank) regulators and cabinet departments.""  “With increased adoption and growth in the digital asset market comes the need for increased education and outreach to protect against new and emerging risks,” he said. “President Biden is right to emphasize the need for increased customer education and consumer protection, while combating illicit activity and safeguarding financial stability.”  Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler tweeted a more restrained statement, merely saying he looked forward to working with his colleagues to address some of the concerns posed by the growth of the digital asset sector.  Rohit Chopra, director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, said his agency “is committed” to lowering the risks that digital assets may pose and protecting individuals from theft and fraud.  The Department of Homeland Security tweeted that Biden's executive order will “further our work to enable financial innovation” while lowering risks, and he said that the Secret Service – which operates under Homeland Security’s auspices – leads the department in those efforts.  U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said in a statement that the order will “promote American leadership” in the field. She echoed other regulators' comments on the potential risks to the financial system, but said the U.S. can promote the system’s resilience.  “I particularly welcome President Biden’s direction to engage with industry, civil society and other interagency partners in developing a framework to promote U.S. economic competitiveness by leveraging digital asset technologies,” she said. “[I] remain eager to hear what we can do to promote the secure and inclusive development of this growing part of our financial services system.”  A Commerce Department spokesperson didn't return a request for comment on the agency's next steps.  Secretary of State Antony Blinken tweeted that digital assets can “benefit consumers and businesses if deployed correctly.”  In a joint statement attributed to National Economic Council director Brain Deese and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, the White House said the directive intensifies the U.S.' efforts to oversee the crypto sector.  “Fundamentally, an American approach to digital assets is one that encourages innovation but mitigates the risks to consumers, investor and businesses, broader financial stability and the environment,” the statement said. “We are clear-eyed that ‘financial innovation’ of the past has too often not benefited working families, while exacerbating inequality and increasing systemic financial risk. This history underscores the need to build robust consumer and economic protections into digital asset development.”",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/03/11/bidens-executive-order-on-crypto-receives-bipartisan-praise,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5c4f54019a5711cea27e0f3ec020574a424df7cd-5000x3335.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42375138,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw5qXZ,1647022283,Biden’s Executive Order Draws Mixed Reactions From Global Crypto Community,"The global crypto community has mixed feelings about U.S. President Joe Biden’s much-anticipated executive order on digital asset regulation. While many welcomed the administration’s initiative to regulate crypto in a comprehensive way, others were disappointed with a lack of clarity and detail in the order itself.  The first-of-its-kind order directs federal agencies to work together to mitigate the risks of the digital asset sector by looking at issues from consumer protection to potential impact on financial stability. Earlier this week, local industry heavyweights welcomed Biden’s order with some relief because they were expecting broad crackdowns on crypto.  Governments and regulators worldwide are calling for the urgent regulation of digital assets, particularly over heightened concerns that targeted parties in Russia may attempt to evade sanctions through the use of cryptocurrencies. The European Union (EU) and the U.S. have imposed heavy economic sanctions on Russia following its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.  Read more: Here's the Full Text of Biden's Executive Order on Cryptocurrency  In February, the president of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, said it was critically important that EU lawmakers vote on the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework, the comprehensive regulatory package aimed at governing crypto assets across all 27 member states.  Meanwhile, India is on the verge of passing a proposal that would levy a 30% tax on any income generated from crypto transactions, and the country has plans to introduce a central bank digital currency (CBDC), or digital rupee, by the end of the year. When it comes to regulating crypto, the world is watching carefully what the U.S. is doing, according to Du Jun, co-founder of Huobi, one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges founded in China and now based in the Seychelles. Biden's executive order is an official acknowledgment of crypto and a step in the right direction for encouraging mass adoption of digital assets, he said.  “We can also expect Biden’s executive order and subsequent regulatory actions to have a global impact. As more countries around the world pass laws to legalize and regulate cryptocurrencies, we can expect to see global adoption rates grow in tandem,” he said in an email to CoinDesk.  Global impact  Vikas Ahuja, the CEO of the Indian arm of the U.S.-based crypto exchange CrossTower, echoed Jun’s statement, saying regulation that quashes innovation could have significant consequences for the U.S., including missing out an opportunity to capitalize on the expansion of blockchain technology.  Naveen Surya, chairman of India’s Fintech Convergence Council says the order aligns with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's “protective and progressive” stance on crypto. Earlier this year, Modi called for global cooperation in enforcing crypto regulations.  “To fight this, every nation, every global agency needs to have collective and synchronized action,” Modi said at the time.  Charles Tan, the head of marketing at Coinstore, a Singapore-based exchange, said other countries, including Singapore, may be looking at the U.S. for inspiration on financial regulations. That’s why all eyes have been on the Biden administration.  According to Tan, the move towards comprehensive regulatory action will help in “flushing out the bad actors” as more countries jump in.  Influencing competition  Sharan Nair, the chief business officer of Indian exchange CoinSwitch, said that, among other things, the order promotes equitable access to financial services and economic competitiveness.  Stefan Berger, a German politician and EU parliamentarian in charge of the MiCA regulatory framework, said it was a good sign the U.S. has chosen the path of innovation as opposed to prohibition. Biden’s order might influence further adoption of innovation-friendly regulation around the world.  “For competitive reasons alone, Europe should get crypto-friendly regulation off the ground and become part of the global crypto family. The fact that Europe is now going to launch MiCA is an important step that the U.S. and other countries around the world will be watching closely,"" Berger said in a written statement shared with CoinDesk.  Light on details  Industry players outside the U.S. noted that the order was light on details and did not specify any positions the administration wants government agencies to adopt.  “Concrete actions are hardly recognizable but ministries and authorities have been instructed to develop policy recommendations and regulatory measures,” said Philipp Sandner, economist and head of the Frankfurt School Blockchain Center.  Michael Charles Borrelli, chief executive officer at U.K. consulting firm MCBorelli Advisors Limited, called the order a “lighthearted attempt at regulating crypto assets without having substance to address systemic issues in the industry.”  Sandner added that the White House is seeking to clean up the distributed responsibilities across multiple authorities. As things stand, responsibility over crypto assets is spread out across a number of agencies, including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). It’s unclear whether or how agency oversight over digital assets may be consolidated.  Some were disappointed by the Biden order. Shivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, one India’s largest crypto exchanges, suggested the order didn’t go far enough.  “Since U.S. citizens are leading the world in crypto asset adoption, formal regulation is the need of the hour. Clarity on taxation, a monitoring body similar to the SEC will be seen as a good start,” Thakral said. “We’re expecting coordinated efforts to maintain consumer protection and at same time to combat illicit financing issues stemming in crypto.”  A digital dollar  In the order, Biden also called for the urgent study of a CBDC, or digital dollar.  A CBDC is mentioned as a strategic tool for developing the future of the U.S. dollar, Sandner said. He added that with China having launched pilots for testing its own national digital currency, the eCNY, work on a digital dollar will bring significant changes to the dynamics in the world of CBDCs.  “The U.S. is seeking a [higher] profile in the CBDC arena than it currently has. The Executive Order is a very clear call to action,” wrote Nilixa Devlukia, founder of Payments Solved and a member of the digital euro market advisory group to the European Central Bank.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,"Sandali Handagama, Amitoj Singh",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/03/11/bidens-executive-order-draws-mixed-reactions-from-global-crypto-community,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5732b647371ab5d971e7a0c5700d82b2afce166f-1024x683.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411500,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOSML,1647021497,We Can Vote Away Your Money for Free: The Implications of Juno Prop 16,"A layer 1 blockchain called Juno is on the verge of doing something radical: taking away tens of millions of dollars’ worth of a holder’s tokens using an on-chain vote by other users.  Juno, a smart-contract layer 1 in the Cosmos ecosystem, was allegedly the victim of a Sybil-like attack in which one user faked multiple wallets to receive a disproportionate share of a recent airdrop. The wallet alleged to belong to the airdrop gamer now contains more than 3.1 million JUNO tokens with a market value of just over $122 million.  A new Juno proposal, Proposal 16, would draw down the “Whale Wallet” to 50,000 JUNO tokens, which the proposal describes as a “fair share” of the airdrop. The proposal argues that, beyond a matter of simple fairness, the reversal is an existential necessity for Juno, because the whale now has a huge share of the network’s voting and economic power (“half of quorum,” according to the proposal).  Proposal 16 is open for voting between March 10 and March 15. Though it’s hard to be certain, it appears this would be the first major instance of a blockchain community voting tokens out of the hands of a fellow holder. (The closest precedent may be the removal of voting rights from some tokens during Justin Sun’s attempted takeover of STEEM. Sun is the founder of the Tron blockchain.)  There are immense implications to discuss here, but they’re discussions we’re going to continue having for a long time, so I’ll keep it short.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  First, it’s useful to compare this to the fallout from the hack of The DAO in 2016. In that case, a contract bug allowed the draining of an Ethereum-based investment fund that at the time contained 15% of all the ETH in existence. The core leadership of Ethereum blockchain decided that the scale of the hack would threaten the long-term health of the ecosystem, and so they campaigned for a fork of Ethereum that took the hacker’s money away. That’s the fork that most people consider “Ethereum” today (This definition of Ethereum is even hard-coded into wallets like MetaMask.)  The fork that let the DAO hacker keep the money is now known as Ethereum Classic, and it has a relatively small but significant community to this day. Those allegiances are philosophical as much as anything: Sticking with ETHClassic after the DAO recovery fork was at the time a rallying cry for the “code is law” crowd that saw the heavy hand of founders including Vitalik Buterin in pushing for the fork as a betrayal of blockchain neutrality. Most users at the time instead saw the incident and its correction as mere growing pains (Ethereum had barely launched), and most current users have probably never even heard of the DAO hack.  However you view it, the debate about such deep intervention changes considerably when it’s happening via on-chain voting, rather than through a fork. A fork is a fundamentally social and nebulous process, often initiated by people with power and influence, but requiring public persuasion to make sure miners continue extending the “correct” chain. On-chain voting, by contrast, is both more rigorous and more opaque: Proposals lay out clear outcomes, but as Buterin himself has pointed out, it’s quite easy to buy votes or manipulate the process in various ways.  Whether it winds up being manipulated (the hacker certainly has the funds to buy votes), the scary part about Juno’s Proposal 16 is something more fundamental. In a very loose sense, it undermines the core cryptocurrency value proposition that if you control your own private cryptographic keys, you have total control over your tokens.  Instead, it shows that blockchains, too, involve social as well as technical consensus. The airdrop Sybil attacker, after all, didn’t break any obvious government laws; he or she just abused an open system so badly that other users had to take action to defend it. For some, this response will be seen as an upside and even an evolutionary path – a significant step, in particular, toward decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) that have real enforcement power and are willing to flex it.  Even if you’re focused on the upside, it will be important and difficult to create a stronger distinction between systems with this sort of on-chain capability, and those that offer true irreversibility. Bitcoin, Ethereum and most other major chains don’t have on-chain proposals or governance mechanisms that would make this possible. Unfortunately, that’s a distinction likely to be lost on the general public and even on most crypto speculators.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETC | MARKET | AIRDROP,David Z.

42410916,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggtGOM,1647020504,Now You Can Try 'Teleporting' Bitcoin for Greater Privacy With CoinSwaps,"Developers have long been working on making Bitcoin more private because every bitcoin (BTC) transaction ever sent is stored in the blockchain, which anyone can see. Last week, Bitcoin privacy programmer Chris Belcher released an alpha version of Teleport, an implementation of privacy technique “CoinSwap,” in an effort to improve bitcoin privacy by making transactions ""invisible.""  The first version of the open-source project is not ready for real funds because it needs more testing, Belcher said in the announcement on the Bitcoin developer email list. It's also missing the key features needed to fully make transactions invisible. But the release shows CoinSwap, a long-standing idea – first described by cryptographer Gregory Maxwell on the Bitcointalk forum in 2013 – finally coming to life.  Read more: CoinSwap and the Ongoing Effort to Make Bitcoin Privacy 'Invisible'  Belcher believes Teleport’s CoinSwap has advantages over CoinJoins, the main privacy-preserving mechanism used today by projects Wasabi, Samourai and JoinMarket. ""Imagine a new privacy tech for bitcoin, like CoinJoin, but can't be blocked [because] the [transactions] look exactly the same as regular [transactions],"" Belcher wrote on Twitter.  Why 'teleport' your bitcoin?  Today, privacy-conscious users take advantage of the wallets Wasabi and Samourai to execute CoinJoins, which scramble a user's bitcoin with many other users' bitcoins, obscuring the coins' tracks.  The problem is that even if CoinJoins obscure where a user's bitcoin is sent, fooling blockchain surveillers, it's still obvious from a glance at the bitcoin blockchain that a CoinJoin has taken place.  If done the right way, CoinSwap transactions, on the other hand, can't be detected on the blockchain. They look just like normal transactions.  ""Imagine a future where a user, Alice, has bitcoins and wants to send them with maximal privacy, so she creates a special kind of transaction. For anyone looking at the blockchain her transaction appears completely normal with her coins seemingly going from address A to address B. But in reality her coins end up in address Z, which is entirely unconnected to either A or B,"" Belcher writes. In a sense, the transaction is being “teleported” elsewhere, hence the project’s name “Teleport.”  Even users who don't use CoinSwap can benefit from it.  ""If even a small percentage of transactions were actually created by this software, anybody doing analysis on the blockchain would always have a niggle in the back of their mind: 'What if this transaction I'm looking at was actually a CoinSwap? How would I know? What if these coins have actually disappeared into the mist?''"" Belcher writes.  ""The doubt and uncertainty added to every transaction would greatly boost the fungibility of bitcoin and so make it a better form of money,"" Belcher added.  ""Fungibility"" is an important property of money, meaning that each unit can be exchanged for any other unit for exactly the same value. We take for granted that a dollar is worth just as much as any other dollar, for instance. Privacy is crucial to preserving fungibility because without it some bitcoins can become ""tainted"" if they are used as part of criminal activity, for example. Then, there's a possibility that an unwitting, non-criminal user receives the tainted coins, only to discover they are harder to trade (and therefore worth less) because of their historical association with a criminal or sanctioned event.  Next steps for 'invisibility'  While it's now possible to execute CoinSwaps using Teleport, the software doesn't make the CoinSwap transactions look like normal transactions just yet.  That's the next ""really big task"" on Belcher's to-do list. The cryptographic technique ECDSA-2P can be used to make these transactions look like normal ""single-sig"" addresses, which are ""overwhelmingly common out there and so provide an enormous anonymity set,"" he writes.  When it comes to Taproot implementation, however, Teleport will have to wait. The Taproot upgrade to Bitcoin, which happened in November 2021, adds Schnorr signatures as an option beyond ECDSA signatures, which are how most transactions are signed today.  Read more: ‘People Will Get Burned’: Matt Odell on the Long Road to Bitcoin Privacy  While Schnorr signatures can do the same thing as ECDSA-2P in an easier way, Belcher argues that Schnorr isn’t suitable for CoinSwap. “This is because the anonymity set for ECDSA would be much greater. All addresses today are ECDSA and none are Schnorr,” Belcher explained when he originally announced the project in 2020. As such, Belcher suggested it might take years before there would be enough of a dataset to make the use of Schnorr in CoinSwaps practicable. But Bitcoin users need privacy much sooner than that.  This alpha release isn't ready for prime time, but developers are invited to test the open-source software if they want to help battle-test it, by using dummy coins on the test and signet networks. ""It is possible to run it on mainnet, but only the brave will attempt that, and only with small amounts,"" Belcher writes.  Longer term, when the project is ready for real funds, he hopes users and wallets will take advantage of the improved privacy it provides.  ""My aim is that the Teleport project will develop into a practical and secure project on the bitcoin mainnet, usable either standalone as a kind of bitcoin mixing app, or as a library that existing wallets will implement allowing their users with the touch of a button to send bitcoin CoinSwap transactions with much greater privacy than was possible before,"" he said.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Alyssa Hertig,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/03/11/now-you-can-try-teleporting-bitcoin-for-greater-privacy-with-coinswaps,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/61c586c6f7aa1565365472869aa0e8584574ef2c-6000x3368.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

On a mysterious new website, Yuga Labs is asking users to provide sensitive personal information – everything from passport numbers to countries of residence – for a shot at access to the company’s next big venture.  Read More:What Is KYC and Why Does It Matter For Crypto?  The relatively sparse site, “somethingisbrewing.xyz,” is designed as a kind of tease; Yuga Labs won’t say exactly what it’s up to.  Clicking the “register” button will direct you to another site called Blockpass, which runs identity verification processes for crypto services. Here, you’ll need to provide your passport, your national ID or your driver’s license, along with proof of residence. There’s also a list of banned countries: If you live in China, Russia, Cuba, Iran or any of 28 other blacklisted nations, you’re out of luck.  On Twitter, the company described the new project as a collaboration with the Hong Kong-based crypto company Animoca Brands, which was recently valued at around $5 billion. Yuga Labs was also recently valued at around $5 billion on the strength of the Bored Ape Yacht Club – now far and away the most successful non-fungible token (NFT) collection in crypto.  The request isn’t an issue in and of itself. The irony is that Yuga Labs has been embroiled in a month-long controversy around privacy norms in crypto, advocating strongly for the position that anonymity should be respected at nearly all costs.  Know your ape?  Last month, Buzzfeed News revealed the identities of Yuga Labs’ core founders, Greg Solano and Wylie Aronow, previously known only by the pseudonyms “Gargamel” and “Gordon Goner.” The reporter Katie Notopoulos dug up the information in publicly available business records. (Solano had incorporated the company under his own name.)  Solano and Aronow framed it as “doxxing” – a word that’s come to mean something like “making your personal identity known” in crypto, but specifically connotes harassment outside of the space (much has been made about whether or not it’s the appropriate term for this particular situation).  “Got doxxed against my will,” tweeted Aronow after the Buzzfeed article went up. “Oh well.”  Yuga Labs CEO Nicole Muniz, who confirmed the founders’ identities to Buzzfeed, then did a 25-minute video interview with a new media outlet called D3 Network, which framed the revelation as “dangerous.” The video is structured as a kind of cable news-style sit-down with someone who’s been wronged.  Crypto enthusiasts and privacy advocates tended to see it that way, too. On the other hand, reporters from traditional media outlets mostly saw it as an extremely normal act of business journalism. I wrote an op-ed to this effect; their names were in public documents, and a reporter dug them up. It is, I and others argued, in the public’s interest to know who’s at the helm of this $5 billion enterprise.  And yet now, after making all this fuss, here they are, asking for your personal information. Oh, and they’ll take a headshot, too.  Yuga Labs may have no choice but to require this information, since financial regulations require companies to collect it in many circumstances.  The culture of crypto values anonymity, but even more than that, it values being early. Yuga Labs’ implicit bet is that the desire to get in early on the next Bored Ape Yacht Club will override the messiness of these KYC (know your customer) requirements.  “We don’t like KYCs either,” the firm wrote on Twitter, “but we think you’re going to want to be a part of this.”",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS,Will Gottsegen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/03/11/after-doxxing-fracas-bored-apes-team-starts-asking-for-customer-id,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d7c0f80f770e9d97cb7ad7974bcdc332024af14b-4288x2680.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

For the first time, these sanctions will include crypto-specific guidance.  Concern over whether Russian oligarchs or the government could use cryptocurrencies to avoid the financial hit imposed by a broad-ranging sanctions regime have grown in recent days, with U.S. lawmakers and European officials all expressing concern over the potential. Officials with the U.S. Treasury Department and industry participants have said this is an unlikely possibility.  Friday's announcement by the White House seems to focus more on reiterating for crypto companies that they should comply with sanctions rather than addressing any usage of such sanctions so far.  ""The Department of the Treasury, through new guidance, will continue to make clear that Treasury’s expansive actions against Russia require all U.S. persons to comply with sanctions regulations regardless of whether a transaction is denominated in traditional fiat currency or virtual currency,"" according to a fact sheet published Friday. ""Treasury is closely monitoring any efforts to circumvent or violate Russia-related sanctions, including through the use of virtual currency, and is committed to using its broad enforcement authorities to act against violations and to promote compliance.""  Treasury spokespeople did not immediately return a request for comment on what the guidance will say or when it will be published.  G7 weighs in  A joint G7 statement also published by the White House specified that this guidance will target the Russian government as well as its proxies, in addition to the oligarchs who are already on multiple sanctions lists.  ""We commit to taking measures to better detect and interdict any illicit activity, and we will impose costs on illicit Russian actors using digital assets to enhance and transfer their wealth, consistent with our national processes,"" the joint statement said.  Ari Redbord, head of legal and government affairs at TRM Labs, told CoinDesk earlier this week that crypto may not serve well as a sanctions-evasion tool for a number of reasons, including liquidity concerns.  ""It's hard"" to move billions of dollars worth of crypto, Redbord noted. It's possible some oligarchs might turn to crypto, but that may not be their first choice. Redbord, who was with the U.S. Treasury Department prior to joining TRM, said crypto could be part of the sanctions-evasion playbook, but oligarchs already have a complex set of tools they might turn to first to preserve their wealth, including the use of shell companies and purchasing high-end art.  A senior administration official similarly said they did not see crypto as being a ""viable workaround"" for the Russian central bank or its economy during a press briefing previewing a sweeping executive order on digital assets.  Friday's news comes days after U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) announced she was drafting a bill to prevent Russian oligarchs or President Vladimir Putin from using crypto to evade sanctions.

Restitution, disgorgement, civil monetary penalties, permanent trading and registration bans, and a permanent injunction against further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and CFTC rules are among the remedies sought by the commission. &apos;This case illustrates how fraudsters never tire of devising schemes to separate people from their hard-earned money, and digital asset frauds are no exception,&apos; said Acting Director of Enforcement Vincent McGonagle. Golden, Patel, and Egerton reportedly ran the websites Empowercoin and Ecoinplus, which they used to defraud victims out of more than $23 million in bitcoin, according to the lawsuit. Meanwhile, Golden, Patel, Aggesen, and a co-conspirator ran the JetCoin website, which raked in almost $21 million in bitcoin.

42411503,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOSWG,1647018349,Elizabeth Warren and the Mysticism of the Crypto-Skeptics,"Hello readers, David Z. Morris here, pleased to be filling in for Michael this Friday.  This week saw the unveiling of the Biden administration’s promised executive order on cryptocurrency regulation. By most accounts, the order appears to be cautious and balanced, largely a call for more research and debate toward a coordinated crypto strategy across U.S. agencies and regulators.  There are a lot of unanswered questions about what a more centralized approach would mean, given that U.S. financial regulators are engaged in a constant internecine cold war for jurisdictional power. But a simple executive demand for clarity feels welcome after nearly a decade during which regulators targeted individual crypto entities for enforcement, without doing much to update or clarify the rules of the road for a radically new technology.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The order also, optimistically, arrives at a moment when the public perception of crypto is primed for a major shift. Russian President Vladimir Putin’s barbaric invasion of Ukraine has showcased in quite clear terms the positive utility of open finance, in the form of close to $100 million in cryptocurrency donated to Ukrainian defense from around the world. Those tokens arrived much faster than some aid from allied governments and went directly to supplies like bulletproof vests and rations for Ukrainian fighters.  Meanwhile, there has been broad consensus among experts that blockchain networks don’t provide a meaningful way for Putin’s Russia to evade economic sanctions intended to punish Russia for the invasion. That’s partly for reasons of scale – even a midsized economy like Russia’s is too big to entirely run on crypto today – but mostly because of crypto’s inherent traceability.  These real-world events undermine the dark narrative that has shadowed cryptocurrency over the years and that seems to inform many regulators now. Early association with darknet markets like Silk Road, and spectacular instances like its use by North Korean ransomware attackers, created an early default consensus that crypto is useful primarily for bad actors. Some political theorists were also very quick to extrapolate from the libertarian values of its cypherpunk founders to argue that cryptocurrency was inherently antisocial.  But the real impacts of crypto in Ukraine contradict that story. The preponderance of benefits, at least in this moment, seems to be accruing to the good guys and helping bind together a global pro-democracy community in ways that would be impossible if it didn’t exist.  The crypto-skeptic fallacy  Unfortunately, as the development of the Biden crypto framework ramps up, some high-profile U.S. officials still do not seem to be paying attention to this real-world complexity. Instead, they are hanging on ferociously to early interpretations of cryptocurrency as inherently criminal, illicit or anti-democratic. Two notable examples of that are Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and, at least in one strange bit of recent testimony, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.  Warren is a longtime and almost mechanistically predictable opponent of cryptocurrency. Now, in the teeth of Russian aggression and a humanitarian crisis on the ground, Warren’s focus has been proposed legislation to prevent crypto-based sanctions evasion – despite assurances from within Treasury itself that further rules aren’t necessary.  A similar disconnect from reality was visible in recent comments by Powell. Ronald Pol, a banking researcher and reformer, recently highlighted several remarks where Powell called for tighter crypto regulation while acknowledging a lack of evidence of the abuses he wanted to stop.  “Ultimately what's needed is [regulations] to prevent… cryptocurrencies from serving as a vehicle for terrorist finance and just general criminal behavior – tax avoidance and the like,” Powell said during March 2 testimony before the House Financial Services Committee. He also admitted, however, that “I don't really know the extent to which it's happening, although you do hear that and read it in the paper.""  Pol described the thrust of the hearing as “unelected elites demand[ing] laws, uncritically accepted by lawmakers, based on mystical incantations and unfounded beliefs.”  Much about this mystical essentialism can be laid at the feet of realpolitik – that is, people saying things they don’t mean in service of other goals. A mandarin like Jerome Powell, for instance, must be thinking of the threat to dollar supremacy posed by any fragmentation of today’s monolithic payments and banking system. That poses a huge risk to U.S. global power in the long term. If hand-waving about theoretical Russian sanctions evasion helps fight off the broader threat, Powell will wave those hands.  Elizabeth Warren’s hostility to crypto, meanwhile, is tied to her long-standing concerns about consumer fraud, which also led her to build the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) after the 2008 financial crisis. Investing fraud and hacking thefts are seemingly the most widespread kinds of crime that involve crypto, and so there’s certainly some meat on that bone.  But I also have a pet theory that hinges on Warren’s midlife conversion from a “diehard conservative” Republican into a left-leaning Democrat starting in the mid-1990s (when Warren was already nearly 50). Her hatred of crypto is performed with the zeal of the convert and affirms her belonging in her adopted tribe, since Democrats are much more likely to support crypto regulation than Republicans. And those are not fact-based positions themselves – one recent literacy survey found that less than 4% of Americans actually have a handle on how crypto works. That would seem a reasonable prerequisite for having an opinion on its social value.  Tribal belonging, realpolitik misdirection and “mystical incantations” are hardly the basis for sound policymaking. Powell and Warren essentially argue that they have crypto’s number, without the need for actual numbers. Despite mounting evidence that crypto is inferior to dollar bills when it comes to even the pettiest of crimes, Warren in particular seems to be convinced that crypto is For Bad Things, period. It is a corrupting force, practically a demon written in code, not dissimilar to the way Renaissance religious authorities regarded “the devil’s chord,” a discordant tritone that was occasionally banned in religious music.  Jerome Powell, meet Jean-Paul  Obviously, a guitar chord can’t actually summon the devil, just as Bitcoin wasn’t built for sanctions evasion. In fact, another group of more technical crypto critics often deride blockchain technology as “a solution in search of a problem” – and you know what, that’s actually correct. More on that shortly.  At the very least, it’s more correct than a quasi-religious certainty that crypto is first and foremost a tool of criminals due for a huge crackdown, despite evidence that legitimate use is growing six times faster than crypto-crime. Such stances reflect a pattern of thought that is not just medieval, but literally ancient – and one whose overthrow has enabled all the social and economic progress of the modern age.  It is convenient, if inevitably reductive, to describe the arc from superstition to reason in terms of two individual thinkers. On the one hand, we have Plato, whose Theory of Forms argued that every actually existing object in the world was just a pale echo of some pure Type that existed far away, in the unseen heavens. That idealism broadly mirrored the prehistoric transition from animistic or shamanistic religions to theistic belief systems like Christianity and Islam, which installed a “higher truth” invisible to lived experience.  It took two millennia for a contrary set of ideas to regain widespread social currency. In opposition to Plato’s belief that the Forms were the highest reality, 20th-century French thinker Jean-Paul Sartre argued that “existence precedes essence.” The gist of the aphorism is that a thing in the world does not have a fundamental nature and that its significance is instead emergent, or discovered through actual events and real-world interactions.  Sartre’s main concern was human nature, which he argued was infinitely flexible, rather than being defined by God or any other outside force. His views were key to the broader movement known as Existentialism. Sartre was borrowing from predecessor Ludwig Wittgenstein, and more broadly from the sweeping revolution of the Enlightenment. Though his relationship with rationality was complicated, Sartre was fundamentally indebted to the Enlightenment’s insistence on evidence and experience, rather than on dogma.  Bitcoin and crypto deserve to be analyzed through a similar lens, though that’s not easy. Bitcoin did, after all, emerge out of a highly politicized “cypherpunk” community, many driven by a strain of digital libertarianism.  But just like a great novel or symphony, the meaning of a revolutionary system isn’t defined in advance by its creators. In fact, the Bitcoin white paper focuses on a strictly limited and purely technical goal that seems universally valuable on its face: enabling digital payments without a third-party intermediary. In the decade since “digital cash” became a reality, the crypto community has been trying to anticipate what that radical innovation actually means.  The emergent nature of crypto is very much baked into its design. A basic proof-of-work token like bitcoin is intended from the start to change over time, both on a daily basis as incentives change the demand for miners and on a longer time scale as a social open-source development process updates the code. That basic template can also be forked or re-engineered for entirely new blockchains and consensus mechanisms.  Much of the collective project of finding ways to leverage blockchain and crypto has been theoretical, but a great deal has been practical – most crypto projects or startups have been effectively laboratories for small-scale testing of ideas that might become bigger in the future. We’re already seeing real uptake of some of the more truly radical use cases, such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), which have incredible potential to transform realms like art and civil society.  Some of those applications – particularly DAOs – could easily wind up fed into the wood chipper of hasty regulation. It’s a common refrain that overregulation quashes innovation, but it’s acutely true in this case. Crypto will continue to change, and crafting rules based on even accurate beliefs about its current state would be a mistake.  Crafting them based on an idealized, Platonic vision of what a financial system “should” be, and who should control it, would be a disaster.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,David Z.

42394539,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bwBXCl,1647016457,Why Invest in Cryptocurrency?,"Everybody comes to crypto investing with their own agenda, whether swift and deliberately or slowly over time. Investing in crypto might seem like a no-brainer compared with the day-trading heavyweights who buy and sell assets during stock market hours (by comparison there’s no time limit on when you can make a profit in the decentralized finance world). And for younger consumers, crypto may even seem inevitable for our social media-driven future.  “A lot of people thought at first dogecoin was a literal joke,” said Randi Hipper, an 18-year-old influencer known as Miss Teen Crypto, in a late 2021 conversation with CoinDesk. “But then people like [Tesla CEO] Elon Musk started tweeting and it got serious. Then [entrepreneur] Mark Cuban got in and started accepting DOGE for payment for the [Dallas Mavericks pro basketball team]. DOGE is serious now.”  But most crypto investors aren’t only in it for popular meme coins like dogecoin. In fact, everyone from hobby traders to institutional investors like JPMorgan Chase are starting to see cryptocurrency, Web 3 and the metaverse as an opportunity-filled trifecta.  Ahead, we introduce a few common reasons why people get hooked into crypto but, more importantly, why they stay.  Speculative Investing  Perhaps the most common reason why people invest in cryptocurrency is to speculate on the price in the hope the asset will be worth more in the future.  Everyone from Twitter thought leaders to institutional wealth managers have made guesses as to when bitcoin will hit $100,000. Adding a speculative sprinkling of crypto to one’s portfolio – somewhere between 1% and 10% – is a common way of gaining exposure to volatile yet potentially lucrative assets while protecting the rest of your money.  In the past decade, we've seen the meteoric rise in the value of coins like bitcoin and ether (the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain) as well as many others. While the rates of return may not match the growth that has occurred over the past few years, many investors are still bullish on the growing place of cryptocurrency in our world.  If you believe in the crypto industry, in other words, making calculated speculative investments is a way to put your money into the future you hope to see.  Just be sure to take a holistic view: “If you need 90% of your assets to live a comfortable retirement, we manage 90% and you take 10%,” says Michelle Brownstein, a certified financial planner and senior vice president of the Private Client Group at Personal Capital. Brownstein often recommends that her clients protect the bulk of their retirement portfolios. Most qualified fiduciaries would make a similar recommendation in order to help clients mitigate emotional decision-making and taking on too much risk.  “That's trying to find that happy medium,” she says.  Investing in crypto as an inflation hedge  Known as “digital gold,” bitcoin specifically was known as an inflation hedge for years thanks to its built-in scarcity. Minting of bitcoin will stop once the number of coins in circulation reaches its hard cap of 21 million. Due to rapid mainstream adoption, bitcoin's value is projected to grow as demand increases.  Read more: How Bitcoin Mining Works  “It's a hedge against inflation because there can't be any more of it,” Gemini’s Dave Abner told CoinDesk in December. “I actually think the biggest thing driving prices is probably sentiment around fears of inflation and diversification of portfolio holdings. It's not about it becoming a currency that people will use in their daily life.”  However, not all cryptos are treated equally. While bitcoin has scarcity coded into its algorithm, other coins are inflationary, meaning there is never going to be a maximum amount minted. Dogecoin, for instance, falls into this category: 10,000 new doge tokens enter circulation every minute, and will continue to do so in perpetuity (unless developers step in to cap the supply.)  Invest in crypto as a store of value  While volatile cryptos like bitcoin aren’t the best holders of stable value, there does exist a type of coin designed for just that very thing: stablecoins.  Stablecoins are crypto assets pegged to fiat currency or other types of assets. They are starting to be used as currency more and more with the help of crypto rewards cards and digital DeFi wallets. People worldwide can transfer money instantly to friends, family or even fellow gamers in a digital world like Splinterlands and Skyweaver.  That said, all cryptos hold value of some kind, even if it’s hard to predict. Once you buy, sell and/or trade your crypto on an exchange to someone, you can store it in either a hot wallet or cold storage device until you want to use it. Even if it’s offline, its value will continue to mature or fall based on the market.  Take part in decentralized banking  A big reason why people love crypto is for the decentralized ethos of peer-to-peer, permissionless banking. Onboarding a new generation of consumers to a digital economy of algorithmic money theoretically eliminates the need for central banking institutions, along with their fees and oversight.  In particular, smart contracts make such a decentralized world possible. Their instructions are enacted according to a coded, open-source algorithm that everyone can see on blockchain.  However, the U.S. government, along with governments abroad, is keeping a close eye on blockchain developments, leaving some to question how long crypto can actually remain decentralized. President Joe Biden just announced he will sign an executive order in March 2022 outlining the federal government’s potential regulatory changes.  Invest now to be part of future technology and infrastructure  Despite crypto’s reputation for being the Wild, Wild West, most can recognize blockchain’s potential as a new technological infrastructure that will one day have real-world value, as laptops, iPhones and cloud storage do already.  “When you think about the technology behind crypto – blockchain technology – there's a ton of other applications for it,” says Michelle Brownstein, a certified financial planner and senior vice president of the Private Client Group at Personal Capital. “So maybe it is the future of some other industry no one's even thought of yet.”  For instance, the enterprise blockchain company CasperLabs launched in 2018 to further research and development based on Ethereum’s smart contract technology. Built off the original specifications designed by Ethereum developers, the Casper Network blockchain was developed to scale crypto technology for widespread enterprise use, according to Medha Parlikar.  “What my co-founders and myself realized is there really wasn't a blockchain built for businesses,” Parlikar says. “Enterprises and organizations are really beholden to regulatory bodies, investors and customers. The Casper protocol is positioning itself as a big stepping stone to help companies kind of go from where they are to transitioning through to implementing and adopting blockchain. We believe that through that process, consumers will ultimately reap the benefits of that.”  According to Parlikar, blockchain technology has the potential to help businesses maintain more secure records, protect customer privacy when handling sensitive information and verify identity more seamlessly.  Sources in the blockchain space also claim the tech can solve headaches across multiple industries and be instrumental in creating better processes for uses like voting access, supply chain transparency, reservations, concert ticket and VIP membership communities, identity protection and more. Investors with the right risk appetite and desire to support burgeoning projects may therefore want to get in on the action by purchasing tokens from a specific project, company, application or ecosystem they believe will be relevant in five to 10 years.  But as with any individual stock purchases – let alone an asset as volatile as crypto – financial planners like Brownstein still recommend caution: “You don’t necessarily have to be in [crypto] today to meet your financial goals,” she says.  Invest in crypto to earn passive Income  Learning to buy and hold crypto in what are known as DeFi positions can result in passive income yields.  Through lending, staking, pooling, and trading, decentralized finance (DeFi) investors can earn interest for allowing their crypto to be part of the overall ecosystem. You typically have to “lock” it up for a time period in order to earn periodic interest on your positions, but DeFi strategies are popular among people with the time and discretionary cash needed to participate.  Earnings vary greatly between platforms, but users can expect to earn anywhere from 3% to 14% APY by staking leading cryptocurrencies. In some instances, specific DeFi investing strategies known collectively as “yield farming” can return significantly higher interest rates.",POSITIVE,DOGE,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | DOGE | TECHNOLOGY,Megan DeMatteo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/why-invest-in-cryptocurrency,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3170b6622413dc6d9004972d496a70798679ffd3-2119x1415.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42375158,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw5qqR,1647015974,Fed's Powell Set to Remove Punch Bowl That Lubricated Crypto Party,"""Economics is the science which studies human behavior as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses,"" the British economist Lionel Robbins wrote in 1932.  Put simply: Every choice comes with tradeoffs that might not be so savory.  It's the position the Federal Reserve finds itself in as the U.S. central bank's monetary-policy committee prepares to convene next week. The dilemma here is whether to fight inflation, risking the possibility that doing so triggers a recession, or to tolerate higher prices and keep the momentum going. Making a choice is easier said than done, with the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war raising the specter of stagflation – a combination of low growth and high inflation.  Observers say Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues will kick-start the tightening process with an interest-rate hike of 25 basis points (0.25 percentage point) next week while also signaling that they will push hard against inflation for the rest of the year. As always, they are expected to preserve their flexibility to adjust the pace if needed.  ""Barring a very sudden tightening of financial conditions, as per February/March 2020, the Fed sticks to plan A, i.e., hike rates by 25 basis points next week,"" Marc Ostwald, chief economist and global strategist at London-based ADM Investor Services International (ADMISI), said in an email.  ""I think the Fed is very much going to echo the European Central Bank in trying to offer an element of predictability in what are very uncertain circumstances, while retaining optionality and flexibility,"" Ostwald added.  Futures contracts on Fed funds imply a 25 basis point rate hike is already baked in to the market; it would be the first rate increase since December 2018. Two years ago, the central bank cut rates close to zero and launched an open-ended, liquidity-boosting, asset-purchasing program to counter the adverse economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic.  Fed's dot plot to signal more rate hikes  Traders will look to Powell and the Fed statements for clues on how fast rates might rise in the coming months. The focus will be on the ""dot plot"" – a pictorial representation of Fed officials' projections for the central bank's key short-term interest rate. The officials also try to project the so-called terminal rate, which is the theoretically neutral interest rate that would both maximize employment and maintain stable prices.  In December, Fed officials contemplated 75 basis points of tightening for 2022 and a terminal rate of 2.5%. According to Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex, these numbers could be revised higher next week.  ""In the middle of December, 10 of the 18 officials expected that 75 basis point in hikes would be appropriate this year. Consider the terminal rate. In December, five officials expected that the Fed funds target at the end of 2024 would be above where the median viewed at the long-term equilibrium rate of 2.5%,"" Chandler said. ""The median is likely to rise by 50 basis points and maybe 75 basis points for this year.""  In other words, the Fed officials were behind the curve – or else the dynamic shows just how worrisome inflation has become in the past couple months. At press time, the Fed fund futures were anticipating a total of five quarter percentage point rate hikes for this year.  While some in the market fear that the Russia-Ukraine conflict will bring stagflation and force the Fed to hike aggressively, Michael Englund, principal director and chief economist at Action Economics LLC, suggests otherwise.  ""Our assumption is that the updraft in commodity prices will diminish into mid-year, and base effects will finally allow an emerging downtrend in the year-over-year inflation metrics,"" Englund told CoinDesk in an email. ""This should diminish pressure on the Fed to address inflation, and should allow for quarter-point hikes at just every other meeting, leaving five hikes for 2022 overall (in March, May, June, September and December).""  Risk assets typically drop when a central bank is expected to hike rates. That's because, while on the one hand, rate hikes bring down inflation, on the other, they weigh over individual and corporate spending, leading to an economic slowdown.  That said, the impending rate hikes may be old news, as the Fed has been preparing markets for the same since November. Bitcoin has declined over 40% since mid-November, predominantly on Fed rate hike fears.  ""The interest rate market has already priced in as many as six rate hikes, and the crypto market is only pricing in more,"" Griffin Ardern, a volatility trader from crypto-asset management company Blofin, said. ""In my opinion, investors have not fully priced in the possibility of an early shrink of the balance sheet or quantitative tightening, say starting in April.""  Focus on quantitative tightening  Quantitative tightening (QT) is the process of balance sheet normalization, also a way of sucking out liquidity from the system.  The Fed's balance sheet has ballooned from $4 trillion to $9 trillion in two years, thanks to the asset purchase program, known as quantitative easing, terminated on Thursday.  The process allowed the central bank to print money out of thin air and increase the supply of bank reserves in the financial system hoping that lenders would pass on the excess liquidity to the economy in the form of loans, bringing economic growth.  With inflation running hot, the central bank intends to reverse the process via quantitative tightening. It essentially means reducing the supply of reserves.  With the Fed likely to begin the hiking cycle next week, more details of quantitative tightening may emerge, as recently signaled by Powell.  ""The process of removing policy accommodation in current circumstances will involve both increases in the target range of the federal funds rate and reduction in the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet,"" Powell said in his recent testimony to Congress.  ""As the FOMC noted in January, the federal funds rate is our primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy. Reducing our balance sheet will commence after the process of raising interest rates has begun and will proceed in a predictable manner primarily through adjustments to reinvestments,"" Powell added.  There are many opinions on how and when the Fed should start quantitative tightening and the pace of the unwind, with consensus ranging from $100 billion per month to $150 billion per month.  According to ADMISI's Ostwald, the Fed may prefer gradual unwinding of the balance sheet. ""My guess is they may opt for a tapering into QT to give themselves extra flexibility, though with larger increments, $25 billion then $50 billion, $75 billion and then $100 billion,"" Ostwald said. ""Their big challenge is that they want to have a strong element of predictability, but the current circumstances are very much antithetical to this.""  Bannockburn's Chandler said, ""the Fed will take the passive approach and allow the balance sheet to shrink, which means extinguishing some reserves by not reinvesting all of the maturing proceeds.""  Last week, Lorie Logan, executive vice president at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said the principal payments on Treasury bonds coming due range from about $40 billion to $150 billion a month over the next few years and average about $80 billion. There's also an average of around $25 billion per month of mortgage-backed securities maturing for the next few years.  Risk assets may face selling pressure if the Fed hints at aggressive rate hikes or an early start to quantitative tightening. The Fed discussed QT in December and then pushed out the great balance sheet unwinding to the third quarter just before the war broke out in Europe.  ""The hawkish risk is that the Fed's statement wording is more aggressive than assumed, with little risk of either a larger rate hike and the start of quantitative tightening,"" Action Economics' Englund noted.  Will the Fed hold fire?  The obvious dovish outcome would be the Fed standing pat on interest rates and offering few clues on quantitative tightening. ""Risk would rally if the Fed were not to raise rates,"" Bannockburn's Chandler said.  Many in the crypto community seem convinced that the Russia-Ukraine war and the recent asset market volatility would deter the Fed from raising rates. Some experts suggest otherwise.  ""The Fed put is certainly out of action, above all because they are behind the curve on inflation, as they have implicitly admitted, and because of the asset price bubble that they have been feeding for so long (again indirectly admitted when talking about stretched valuations),"" ADMISI's Ostwald said.  The ""Fed put"" is the notion that the central bank will come to the rescue if assets tumble. The firm belief was evident in 2021 when retail investors consistently bought the dip in stock markets.  However, the Fed is unlikely to halt tightening unless signs of liquidity stress emerge in the global financial system.  ""If financial conditions deteriorated sharply and suddenly in the context of other headwinds or risks materializing, yes, I think the Fed put, which means trying to offset the undesirable deterioration in financial conditions, broadly understood, is still there,"" Bannockburn's Chandler said.  ""It says nothing about a 10% or 20% fall in a major equity index in absolute, but the recent drop, the Fed judged, in the current context not to adversely or unfairly tighten financial conditions,"" Chandler added.  The above chart by Goldman Sachs shows that while financial conditions in the U.S. have tightened somewhat in recent weeks, the overall situation is still much better than the March 2020 crash.  It simply means the Fed is unlikely to hold fire next week.  ""As long as there is no threat to the banking system, they [Fed] will not be unhappy seeing some of the leverage squeezed out of markets, but would certainly step back in (Fed put style), if feedback loops from the tertiary/shadow banking sector start to threaten the primary banking sector,"" ADMISI's Ostwald quipped.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/03/11/feds-powell-set-to-remove-punch-bowl-that-lubricated-crypto-party,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/20436e40b2d4bbfea24bd109ddedd4022b258937-856x468.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411515,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOSwi,1647015841,Safeguarding Our Privacy in an Age of Transparency,"First we had personalized Geocities sites and AOL Instant Messenger profiles. Then we had MySpace accounts, quickly followed by the Facebook page. Now we have Web 3 wallets.  People are increasingly using their Web 3 wallets as a way to signal who they are to others. Wallets are no longer just abstractions representing ownership. They are digital profiles that share our tastes, beliefs, values and, yes, trading history.  Jill Gunter, a CoinDesk columnist, is co-founder and Chief Strategy Officer of Espresso Systems.  If you use an Ethereum Name Service address (or something similar) or if you have a non-fungible token (NFT) linked to your Twitter profile picture, you are broadcasting your data to the world and, whether consciously or not, making a statement about yourself. If you curate and showcase your NFTs, collect proof of attendance protocol (POAP) mementos, brag about your trades and investments to fellow degens (with the block explorer receipts to match) or donate to causes you care about from your crypto wallet, then you are using your wallet in this manner.  All of this transparency is one of the really compelling features of blockchains and the products they enable. Leveraging this transparency to create a portable online profile is a delightful and novel application for users.  Unlike personal websites and Facebook profiles, your blockchain wallet is permanent. It can be manipulated without your consent through people sending or airdropping your tokens. It showcases not only who you are but also what you own, when you acquired it, what you traded it for and all manner of potentially sensitive financial data.  Read more: Dan Jeffries – The Trojan Horse of Privacy  This is a problem in all kinds of obvious ways. Your tastes might change over time and you might someday be horrified at the NFTs you spent so much money on, but there will be no way to scrub them from your history. The causes you donate to and how much you donate might come under unwanted scrutiny. One of your investments might skyrocket in value and you might suddenly be uncomfortable with everyone knowing how much money you’ve made.  There are more subtle ways the public wallet-profile can become a problem. Unwanted airdrops are a good example. Last year, Vitalik Buterin became a target of several such airdrops to his wallet as the creators of various dog-related meme coins sent billions of dollars’ worth of the tokens to the Ethereum co-creator's wallet. This is an uncomfortable and burdensome situation.  Web 3 applications can empower builders to be intentional about who sees their users’ data.  Other ugly scenarios are also imaginable. Spammers may blast you with unwelcome, inappropriate content in the form of NFTs. Competitive traders can work to manipulate markets to move against your positions. You could become the target of a “$5 wrench attack,” wherein an adversary extorts you by threatening you physically, knowing how much cryptocurrency you own.  Today, we are in a golden age of enjoying on-chain transparency for all it offers us. I predict, however, a time when we are no longer comfortable with having all of this personal and financial data on permanent display, particularly as the tools to view and analyze blockchains become ever more sophisticated and ubiquitous.  There are options available to those who want more privacy when it comes to their Web 3 existences. One approach is to use multiple wallets and work diligently to keep them unlinked from each other, protecting the privacy of at least a subset of your holdings by keeping that wallet address to yourself. This option is operationally complex when done right and, when executed imperfectly, offers only a superficial level of privacy.  For those wanting more complete privacy for their Web 3 applications, there are options like Zcash, Monero, TornadoCash and Aztec’s zkMoney. Generally, the way that these products are used is for full anonymity and masking of amounts being held and moved. But Zcash’s view keys and TornadoCash’s compliance tool, touch upon something more interesting: the ability to selectively reveal data about what you are doing to someone else.  Most crypto and Web 3 applications today offer full transparency all the time, while a select few default to the fullest privacy possible. Neither of these options reflect how users tend to actually conceive of their needs and desires around how they share their data.  Read more: David Z. Morris – The Privacy Boom Is Going to Change Everything  The technology industry loves to debate whether people actually care about privacy or not. This is rarely an informative or fruitful discussion because it is so vague. Privacy from whom? About what? Under what circumstances? It is a rare person who does not care about their privacy whatsoever! Those who say users do not care have not adequately defined in what ways their users care. Privacy is not black and white. It is a spectrum that is ripe for Web 3 developers, asset creators and entrepreneurs to explore to meet their users’ needs.  The future of crypto assets and Web 3 applications can empower builders to be intentional about who sees their users’ data. Espresso Systems, the company I am working on, is unlocking these possibilities for asset creators with our Configurable Asset Privacy protocol. Other projects including Mina, Aleo, and Secret Network are also tackling the problems presented by the blanket transparency of blockchains.  These platforms all have the promise to yield the next generation of Web 3 products that will lean into transparency where users want it and guarantee privacy where users demand it. They will have the ability to educate users about their options and drive users to a place of more well-informed consent about what data they share and with whom.  We can imagine all manner of new offerings that better protect users and their data while continuing to provide the benefits of real-time transparency. Stablecoins will be designed to offer users privacy from public view while also aligning with the risk management needs of the issuers, unlocking their use in payments for retail and businesses alike. Asset managers will be able to protect their investment strategies from public view while maintaining the ability to audit the history of their holdings. Mainstream consumers will be able to use their wallets as their profiles while being able to choose who can see the monkeys and witches in their wallets – without displaying their income, investments or donations for all to see.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | ZEC | ENS,Jill Gunter,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/03/11/safeguarding-our-privacy-in-an-age-of-transparency,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5560126fb647146b5d19b57db3a04ac21d0d554f-5836x3891.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In our last article, we wrote about the weakness of buyers in the range of $2. Several weeks have passed and we see that the nature of the EOS fall and the level of investor interest has not changed. The price continues to fall slowly at low volumes. Like many other cryptocurrencies, the volatility of the EOS cryptocurrency has significantly dropped. The price movement continues in a falling wedge. In our opinion, the maximum period of such passivity of buyers is possible till the end of March. If during the first month of spring we do not see aggressive actions by buyers and attempts to test the mark of $2.9, in April there will be a tragedy. The essence of this tragedy is a new growth wave with the first target of $1.65. But, this is not the worst case scenario. EOS investors really need to start panicking after unsuccessful attempts by buyers to regain control of the $2 mark. In this case, you should think carefully about whether you need to keep such a cryptocurrency in your investment portfolio. However, the above scenario is an alternative for us. Given the long wave of fall without any local upward correction, we still expect consolidation in the range of $2-$2.9.

One such example is Bitcoin which fell 5.9% to $39,432 when writing these words. The bitcoin market is still bearish, with prices dipping below $40,000 today. This comes after a slew of positive news about US President Joe Biden&apos;s executive order that will likely focus more on the crypto sector. The crypto markets were not looking very promising today, with Bitcoin declining heavily and many other coins dropping as well. For example, Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, fell as much as 4.4% to $2,589.

Bitcoin rose as much as 11% on Wednesday following an executive order from Biden that appears to frame digital assets in a positive light. However, those gains proved fleeting, and traders soon realized the news didn&apos;t live up to their expectations.

Although big studios dominate the landscape, individual creators have found a home on OnlyFans and similar platforms. Unfortunately, those platforms can easily prevent creators from distributing their content, and they charge exuberant fees on top. Adult Content Remains Booming Business One cannot deny the appeal of platforms like OnlyFans. Content creators can custom-tailored content packages for their fans and explore revenue streams. Moreover, it enhances the interaction level between creator and fans, which would not be possible otherwise. However, the downside of such platforms is how they charge up to 40% per transaction, reducing the amount of money going back to the creators. Additionally, OnlyFans shocked the world by trying to move away from adult content in 2021. It was a very curious decision - which was ultimately reversed - but it also highlights how these platforms can censor content on a whim&apos;s notice. That poses a significant threat to adult content creators. For now, OnlyFans still allows this type of content, but nothing prevents them from changing their mind yet again.

The position was structured as an ""asymmetric trade,"" meaning the downside risk is small and the potential payoff is large, according to Fir Tree clients, Bloomberg reported.  The hedge fund had started to explore taking a short position on USDT last July, according to the report.  The firm reasoned that much of the $24 billion in commercial paper backing the token is tied to Chinese real estate developers, some of whom are struggling, and so if the paper loses value, that would potentially lead to a big drop in both Tether's reserves and the coin's price.  Fir Tree is betting its trade will pay off within 12 months, the Bloomberg report said.  The firm is also mulling setting up a separate fund just for shorting tether if there’s enough client interest.  Fir Tree didn’t immediately respond to CoinDesk’s request for comment.

The SEC had extended its review period to receive and review comments on NYDIG’s spot ETF product, and has now concluded it didn’t meet sufficient criteria, citing concerns around fraud, manipulation and valuation methodology.  The rejections come as no surprise as SEC Chair Gary Gensler has indicated multiple times that he prefers to see a bitcoin futures ETF over one that holds bitcoin directly.  The SEC has recently rejected applications for spot bitcoin ETFs from Fidelity, First Trust, Kryptoin, Van Eck and WisdomTree.

Sign up here to get it in your inbox each weekday morning.  Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market Moves: Ether-bitcoin implied volatility spread suggests investors are focused on macro factors. Bitcoin shorts surge on Bitfinex.  Featured stories: U.S. yield curve signals recession.  And check out the CoinDesk TV show “First Mover,” hosted by Christine Lee, Emily Parker and Lawrence Lewitinn at 9:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern time. Today’s show will feature guests:  David Gan, founder and general partner, OP Crypto.  Pavel Kravchenko, co-founder, Distributed Lab.  Market Moves  By Omkar Godbole  Major cryptocurrencies traded in familiar price ranges while traditional risk assets picked up a bid early Friday after Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly said there were some ""positive shifts"" in talks between Russia and Ukraine.  While bitcoin bounced 1.3% to nearly $40,000, it remained locked in a six-week triangle pattern identified by Jan. 24 and Feb. 24 lows and Feb. 10 and March 2 highs. Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, also traded similarly.  The spread between the six-month ether and bitcoin implied volatilities fell to a two-year low of 13%, perhaps indicating that the cryptocurrencies' fortunes are more strongly tied to each other than before. Implied volatility refers to investors' expectations for price turbulence over a specific period.  Perhaps, the common force driving the two could be the next week's Federal Reserve meeting. The central bank is expected to lift borrowing costs by 25 basis points and offer more clues on when and how it plans to shrink its balance sheet.  The long-short ratio on Bitfinex, one of the top 10 crypto exchanges by trading volumes, tanked nearly 70% to the lowest since July 2021, as the number of bearish bets surged.  Some investors took it as a warning of an impending drop, while others anticipated a potential short squeeze that would send bitcoin higher.

A curve inversion is when short-term borrowing costs rise above long-term borrowing costs.  In a note published Thursday, Goldman Sachs warned of a U.S. recession next year, putting the probability at 35%, according to Bloomberg. Further, the investment bank downgraded their growth forecast for 2022, citing soaring oil prices and economic fallout from the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war.  Recession fears may bode well for assets with a safe-haven appeal. While bitcoin's link with the real economic activity is still relatively weak, the cryptocurrency tends to move or less in tandem with risk assets, mainly high-beta stocks, as discussed in Tuesday's First Mover edition.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,"Omkar Godbole, Parikshit Mishra",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/03/11/first-mover-americas-ether-bitcoin-volatility-spread-slides-bitfinex-shorts-surge,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f61c61c257346a9a6579febc3f8b9a48111a0674-612x415.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The landmark figure was reached nearly 15 months after Eth 2.0 staking went live in November 2020 following a consensus vote.  Eth 2.0 is the Ethereum network’s multi-stage shift to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, which validates transactions using nodes run by “stakers.” This is in favor of the current proof-of-work design, which relies on centralized entities called “miners” for validating transactions on the network.  The current design has resulted in a slow and expensive network, with fees reaching exorbitant prices of $250 and above, during periods of congestion.  The Eth 2.0 deposit contract initially required 524,000 ether to launch but was oversubscribed by over 400% in the days closer to the launch after a slow start.  The data shows that 67,040 unique depositors have contributed to the staking contract. The contributed ether is locked and inaccessible but stakers are earning 4.81% in annual yields, data from Staking Rewards show.  This month saw a spike of ether deposits to the Eth 2.0 contracts after a relatively lean period in January and February this year, charts show.  Eth 2.0 is currently in the so-called ‘Kintsugi’ testnet stage before rollout. Testnets run atop and mimic the activity of the core blockchain, or mainnet, without affecting it. They allow developers and the community to test applications and features in a controlled setting.  Ether saw nominal gains of 2.9% in the past 24 hours as the broader crypto market remained flat.

The draft, published on the bank's official website on Thursday, says banking corporations have to conduct risk assessments and set out policy and procedures for transfers coming from or going into virtual currencies.  For licensed crypto firms or financial asset service providers, banks will be ""required to examine each case on its own and will not be allowed to issue a sweeping refusal to the service provider.""  Banks will also be required to clarify the source of the money used to purchase crypto, and track the path of movement as virtual currency passes hands ""from the time of its purchase until its conversion to fiat currency and deposit into an account with the banking corporation.""  The draft aligns with anti-money laundering (AML) rules that took effect in November. Crypto advocates in Israel told CoinDesk at the time that banks had typically taken an ad hoc approach to accepting deposits involving crypto, and they were hopeful new rules would help banks onboard crypto users more easily.  The proposal is open for comments, after which final guidelines will be formulated.  Regulators worldwide are ramping up AML regulations and compliance to prevent the use of crypto for money laundering.

Most of the dApps that are developed in the Ethereum blockchain are hosted as ERC-20 tokens which are in their hundreds of thousands. Presently, transactions in the tokens are carried out by using ether in buying the gas fees. What is Ethereum? Ethereum is a cryptocurrency that was co-founded by Russian Vitalik Buterin with other cofounders like Gavin Wood, Charles Hoskinson, and others in 2013. It raised over $18.3 million through its public sale of 60 million Ether in 2014 at an initial coin offering price of $0.311. It uses the Solidity programming language that is highly secured to ensure that assets stored in private wallets are saved from attacks. Ethereum is a community-driven coin that wants to ensure that everyone in the world can transact with ease and also launch their projects on the platform. The native token Ether attained an all-time high price of $4,891.70 on November 16th, 2021 during the bullish run of some of the top 100 cryptocurrencies.

Operators must be registered with the FCA to offer ATM services and comply with money laundering regulations, the FCA said in a statement on Friday.  As none of the 27 fully registered crypto firms have been approved to offer ATM services, any crypto ATMs in the U.K. are operating illegally. According to data by Coin ATM Radar, there are 81 bitcoin ATMs/tellers in the U.K.  The FCA made reference to Gidiplus, a firm providing crypto ATM services, which had its registration application rejected by the financial watchdog.  The firm took its case to court in order to continue its services pending its appeal. The case was dismissed as the judge determined there was a ""lack of evidence as to how Gidiplus would undertake its business in a broadly compliant fashion.""  As of March 7, 106 firms have applied for registration with the FCA to offer crypto services. Of those, 27 are now fully registered with 56 refused or having withdrawn their application.  The remaining 23 form the FCA's Temporary Registration Regime (TRR), which allows them to continue to operate while their applications remain under assessment. The deadline for their application approval is March 31.

The AXS price is still at a critical point, from which it can both fall sharply and grow sharply. Sellers managed to push the AXS price out of the trend growth channel. However, all this happened on low volumes and now the price is very close to the bottom trend line of the channel. Much more important is the fact that buyers keep the $47 range. But, looking at the weekly timeframe, there is no certainty that buyers have enough strength for a long siege. https://www.tradingview.com/x/mARsVFiZ/ Since the beginning of February, sellers have managed to lower the price without much effort. So the AXS price fell very slowly, but what will happen when sellers add aggression? The positive scenario for the AXS market at the moment is the continuation of local consolidation in the range of $47-$68. This scenario will allow buyers to gain time and gain the right positions for a new growth wave with a target of $112. In our opinion, this is the main interest of sellers in selling this cryptocurrency. Though, if the $47 mark does not stand during March, at best the lazy AXS fall will continue with the final target of $20.

Key technical points: XRP coin price is soon to outgrow the triangle pattern. The altcoin price moves along the 50-day EMA. The 24-hour trading volume of Ripple is $2.09 Billion, marking a 20% fall. Past Performance of XRP The XRP coin price takes support at the ascending trendline of the triangle pattern, indicating the possibility of a bullish reversal. However, the bottled-up triangle pattern may fail to hold the bullish reversal, but the 3.84% bearish candle diminishes the case of a high momentum reversal.

Will the trendline bring a trend reversal? Key technical points: ADA coin price moves close to the descending trendline The 50-day EMA provides a dynamic barrier The 24-hour trading volume of Cardano is $807 Million, marking a 16% fall. Past Performance of ADA The ADA coin price fails to surpass the 200-day EMA despite the 44% rise from the support trendline. The reversal creates a downtrend that continues with the descending support trendline. It accounts for a discount of 50% from the rejection at $1.60 within two months. Source-Tradingview ADA Technical Analysis ADA coin prices may generate a sell signal with closing below the descending trendline, potentially resulting in a price fall to $0.72. However, a reversal from the trendline will create a buy signal if the prices close above the 50-day EMA at $1. After the death cross from the 50-day, EMA provides a constant dynamic barrier to keep the bullish growth in check. Therefore, the breakout of the mobile border will generate an excellent buying spot.

The short-term depends on the reaction at $2k and $1.6k—a critical support level—in the near term. Past Performance Maker and DeFi tokens are still recovering after posting deep losses. When writing, MKR prices are within a $400 zone defined by $1.6k on the lower side and $2k on the upper side. Additionally, MKR is within a descending triangle, finding support from around the H1 2021 level at $1.6k. Maker Technical Analysis Although there are hints of strengths and possible pullback from 2022 lows, Maker bulls are struggling. The inability to confirm gains of March 9 and push above $1.92k may slow down the momentum in the short term. A break above the resistance trend line and the descending triangle is critical for buyers expecting prices to bottom up to retest March 2022 highs of $2k. In the near-term, losses below $1.7k may heap more pressure on Maker sellers, a move that may see MKR slide below $1.6k posting new 2022 lows. What to Expect of Maker (MKR)? DeFi tokens, including Maker, are struggling in the current bear run. However, a close above $1.92k may spark demand, lifting the coin above March highs—a round number at $2k.

BTC is at risk of more downsides towards the $37,200 and $36,600 levels. Bitcoin started another decline below the $40,000 and $39,000 levels. The price is trading below $39,000 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $39,000 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair might continue to move down unless the bulls able to push the price above $39,550. Bitcoin Price Extends Decline Bitcoin price struggled to stay above the $40,000 support zone. As a result, BTC extended decline below the $39,550 support zone and the 100 hourly simple moving average. The price traded below the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the main increase from the $37,160 swing low to $42,550 swing high. It is now showing a few bearish signs below the $39,200 and $39,000 support levels. Bitcoin is also testing the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the main increase from the $37,160 swing low to $42,550 swing high at $38,430. If there is a minor recovery wave, the price might face resistance near the $38,850 level. The first major resistance on the upside is near the $39,000 zone. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $39,000 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair.

Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin settles below $40,000 after a drop late Wednesday; most other major cryptos are in the red.  Insights: Foreign investors have been fleeing India the past two weeks; Singapore reinforces its status as a crypto hub.  Technician's take: Pullbacks could stabilize into the Asia trading day.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.

Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $39,530 -6%  Ether (ETH): $2,613 -3.6%  Top Gainers  There are no gainers in CoinDesk 20 today.  Top Losers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Cosmos ATOM −6.6% Smart Contract Platform Bitcoin BTC −6.0% Currency Solana SOL −5.6% Smart Contract Platform  Cryptos falter  The glory was temporary.  Little more than 24 hours after bolting past $40,000 as the release of a U.S. presidential executive order approached, bitcoin (BTC) was on its way down past the psychologically important barrier. By early Thursday the largest cryptocurrency by market value had settled at around $39,500.  Ether (ETH) and almost all other altcoins in the CoinDesk top 20 by market cap spent much of their day well into the red.  Cryptos and other assets continued to receive a buffeting from Russia's escalating military campaign against neighboring Ukraine because of the economic fallout and from inflationary pressure. In the latest horror story, Russian forces bombed a maternity hospital in the besieged port of Mariupol, a key target on the Black Sea coastline. Russia hopes to take the city to establish a pathway to the Crimea peninsula, which it annexed eight years ago, freeing more of its force to focus on Kyiv and other major cities to the north.  The price of Brent crude, a key measure of global oil supply, was selling near $110 per barrel, well off its high of $130 earlier this week but well over its range just a month ago. In the U.S., inflation accelerated in February to a fresh four-decade high, signaling supply and demand imbalances were little improved amid soaring gas prices. The Consumer Price Index rose 7.9% over the past 12 months, the fastest since 1982, the U.S. Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Thursday.  Yet, 3iQ Digital Assets President Chris Matta told CoinDesk TV's First Mover hosts that the recent combination of events were encouraging for crypto. ""When you look at this holistically – the macro environment, the regulatory updates, it legitimizes the space, and it's showing maturity in the crypto asset class that institutions can't ignore,"" Matta said.  He added: ""When we talked about what that background looks like, it's super positive for Bitcoin. Traditional assets are potentially going to struggle, inflation is going to continue to be elevated, and we're going to see more interest from institutional investors.""  Markets  S&P 500: 4,259 -0.4%  DJIA: 33,174 -0.3%  Nasdaq: 13,120 -0.9%  Gold: 1,996 +0.2%  Insights  The flight of foreign investment from India  India, one of the world’s biggest crypto markets by trading volume and users, has seen an exodus of funds from foreign investors. Some $2.9 billion worth of foreign capital left Indian shores last week, and this week already saw $1 billion worth of sales on Monday and Tuesday each.  Earlier this week the rupee fell to lifetime lows of 77.11 against the dollar, causing further stress in a market reeling from the ill effects of increasing crude oil prices. India imports over 85% of its fuel from Russia and other countries, with sanctions pushing prices of oil to as much as $140 a barrel earlier this week.  While noting the likely toll of the war on the Indian economy over the next six months, at least one financial advisor told Bloomberg in an interview on Wednesday that foreign investors could return as the conflict wound down.  What this means for crypto investment in the world’s second-largest country by population is unclear, although in a positive sign earlier this week, Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said she expects the nation's central bank to launch a central bank digital currency (CBDC), or digital rupee, “this year.” The statement accelerate the timetable from an earlier pronouncement that the CBDC would launch between 2022 and 2023.  Singapore grants Paxos a license  Singapore reinforced its status as a cryptocurrency hub on Thursday, granting a license to crypto trading and custody platform Paxos, CoinDesk’s Ian Allison reported.  Paxos became the first crypto firm to receive regulatory approval in both New York and Singapore, the company said.  Crypto companies of a certain size tend to shop for licenses on an ongoing basis, especially in strategically important financial centers like the U.S., Singapore and Switzerland.  Paxos, which holds a limited purpose trust charter for digital assets in the U.S. and was one of the first crypto firms to be regulated by the New York Department of Financial Services, has had a presence in Singapore since 2012, said Rich Teo, co-founder and CEO of Paxos Asia.  “It’s almost 10 years actually since we were first incorporated and established in Singapore, so throughout history we’ve always been a little bit New York, a little bit Singapore as well,” Teo told CoinDesk.  Attaining a crypto license from the MAS is no easy task, with 100 or so applicants having been turned away, Nikkei Asia reported late last year. So far just a handful of firms have gained crypto licenses, including DBS Vickers Securities, which is a unit of Singapore's DBS Bank.  Asia indices on a downward trend  U.S. equity markets aren’t the only ones that have been suffering.  The Hong Kong Hang Seng Index reached its lowest point since July 2016 amid concerns about the escalating Russian invasion and Beijing’s COVID-19 restrictions and tighter oversight of companies. The Hang Seng offers a snapshot of the Hong Kong trading market, which is one of the world’s largest.  China’s CSI 300 Index rose 1.6% on Thursday, but is nursing a 13% loss since the start of 2021. Indices tracking equities in South Korea and Japan are down about a similar 10% in the same period.  Technician's take  Bitcoin Returns to Range Below $40K; Support at $35K-$37K  Bitcoin (BTC) turned lower after approaching resistance near $40,000. The cryptocurrency remains in a tight trading range, although support between $35,000 and $37,000 could stabilize pullbacks into the Asia trading day.  BTC traded around $39,000 and is down 6% over the past 24 hours.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the four-hour chart declined from overbought levels, which preceded a pullback in price. On the hourly chart, the RSI is oversold, suggesting brief periods of buying activity could occur.  Still, negative momentum signals on the monthly chart points to limited upside for BTC. The current range could persist until a decisive breakout or breakdown is confirmed.

42375146,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw5qf7,1646958252,OnlyFans Donated 500 ETH to DAO Supporting Ukraine,"The popular video subscription platform OnlyFans says it donated 500 ETH (roughly $1.3 million) to UkraineDAO, a decentralized autonomous organization raising funds to support Ukraine during its war against Russia.  A representative of OnlyFans told CoinDesk the donation is a part of the company’s larger charitable effort to support Ukraine, led by OnlyFans’ Ukrainian-American owner Leonid Radvinsky.  The company says it has now sent over $5 million to various humanitarian efforts supporting the country, with an additional $1 million donation planned to be sent March 15.  “These tragic events have had a terrible impact on individuals including members of our creator community,” Ami Gan, CEO of OnlyFans, said in a statement. “Given our strong personal ties to Ukraine, we wanted to support in a way which felt true to who we are at OnlyFans and which focused on getting aid and support to the Ukrainian people.”  UkraineDAO has been a leading crypto contributor to Ukraine’s government in recent weeks, which has now received over $50 million in crypto donations since tweeting out its ether (ETH) and bitcoin (BTC) addresses in February.  The DAO was formed by Russian art collective Pussy Riot and non-fungible token (NFT) studio Trippy Labs, with its largest single donation coming from a $6.5 million crowdfunded NFT sale on March 2, to which OnlyFans’ 500 ETH donation contributed.  At the point that OnlyFans made the 500 ETH donation, the DAO was stalled at about half of the 1,000 ETH reserve amount, a representative said. The OnlyFans donation pushed the amount over the top, and from that point on more donations began to pile in.
