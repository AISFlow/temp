Released today, the video finds Tapscott reviewing points from his most recent book, ""Blockchain Revolution,"" published earlier this year and co-authored by his son, Alex Tapscott.  In remarks, Tapscott sticks to discussing the technology broadly and in terms that seek to communicate what he views as the coming wave of innovation spurred by the creation of the bitcoin blockchain and digital assets.  Tapscott said:  ""For the first time now people everywhere can trust each and transact peer to peer. Trust is established not by some big institution, but by collaboration, cryptography and by some clever code.""  Tapscott is currently hosting a blockchain workshop in Ontario, Canada, with Hyperledger's Brian Behlendorf, ConsenSys' Joe Lubin and about a dozen others.  A video of that presentation has just been published to TED's website and is now making the rounds on social media.

42427025,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJyerh,1472151314,Ethereum Wallet Update Sparks Debate Over 'Corporate' Integration,"One of ethereum's best-known wallets released new updates today, though one drew outsized attention due to the perceived preferential treatment it gave to an industry startup.  Perhaps the most notable Mist update was the integration of a widget created by startup Coinbase that allows users to purchase up to $5 worth of ether, ethereum's cryptocurrency. As the feature allows for the instant buying of ether through the wallet, many in the community view it as an upgrade that could appeal to newer ethereum users.  But because the Mist wallet is sponsored by the non-profit Ethereum Foundation, the update stirred up concerns that the project's senior members were giving Coinbase an unfair advantage.  The crux of the debate can be summed up by this tweet by Anthony Di Iorio, in which the project co-creator suggested the foundation was ""picking winners"". The discussion continued on social media, where Di Iorio, who founded his own ethereum wallet Jaxx, expanded on his case.  ""[The Ethereum Foundation] should be remaining neutral and focus on education, protocol, security, performance and things like scaleability [sic],"" he wrote.  Currently in beta  , Mist is meant to serve as a wallet for smart contracts that functions like a browser and that allows users to manage custom tokens.  Discussion furthered  Other ethereum users don’t see the integration as favoritism, but as a way to advance the project by offering an easier way to buy ether, which is meant to power decentralized applications on the platform.  Reddit user cryptopascal argued that it's ""unfair"" to call the move favoritism because Coinbase is one of the only services to allow users to exchange traditional currencies for ether.  Di Iorio's comments also prompted a discussion about how best to add features without suggesting preference of a certain company.  Another user added: “I have nothing against the foundation collaborating with commercial parties, but they should do it is in such a way that they remain neutral and offer the same opportunities and visibility to everyone.""

In an order issued yesterday, US District Judge Kenneth Marra approved a request by plaintiffs for class action certification, originally filed on 27th July.  According to the order, the certification covers all Cryptsy account holders as of 1st November, 2015. Specifically, it includes anyone ""who held bitcoins, alternative cryptocurrencies or any other form of monies or currency"" prior to that date on the exchange.  The lawsuit dates back to January, when after months of growing problems with withdrawals, Cryptsy abruptly closed amid claims it had suffered a debilitating hack a year and a half prior. At the time, the exchange said that it had millions in outstanding customer liabilities.  CEO Paul Vernon, one of the defendants named in the class action suit, said at the time that customers were misled about the health of the exchange in order to avoid a ""panic"".  In yesterday's court order, Marra further wrote:  ""The Class claims are the conversion, negligence, unjust enrichment, specific performance, FDUPTA, fraudulent conveyance and civil conspiracy claims contained in counts I-V and VII – IX of the Amended Complaint.""  The certification comes months after the court approved a receiver, handing over control of Crypty's assets in the process.  A recent report from receiver James Sallah alleged that Vernon had misappropriated millions of dollars in user funds, an allegation Vernon later denied in an email to CoinDesk.  Despite denying the claims, Vernon, who is believed to be residing somewhere in Asia, has yet to formally respond to the suit in court.

42427038,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJyfDh,1472139617,Majority of Global Exchanges Now Testing Distributed Ledger Tech,"A global trade organization for financial exchanges released a new survey today on distributed ledgers, highlighting views held by industry incumbents regarding the technology.  Twenty-four firms, constituting exchanges, central securities depositories and central counterparties, collectively dubbed ""financial market infrastructures"", or FMIs, took part in the survey, published by the World Federation of Exchanges (WFE).  In total, there were 25 participants, and of those services, 21 said that they were actively exploring applications of the technology. Firms who participated in the survey include Nasdaq, CME Group, the Australian Securities Exchange, LCH.Clearnet and the Japan Exchange Group, among others.  The report largely mirrors similar publications in the past, outlining how market incumbents are exploring the technology and developing proof-of-concepts while at the same time expressing regulatory and cybersecurity concerns.  The WFE report states:  ""In most cases FMIs are focusing on applications which aim to create process efficiencies and cost savings, though some are also pursuing new service lines and revenue opportunities. Given the relatively nascent state of the technology – particularly as applied to capital markets – FMIs are uncertain about the extent to which the technology will live up to its promise.""  Further, the survey highlights how market incumbents have largely favored group settings, naming the Hyperledger blockchain project and the Post-Trade Distributed Ledger Group in particular.  The WFE, founded in the early 1960s, includes more than 60 exchange services among its membership.  Industry progress detailed  Broader implications aside, the report goes on to offer details about the current status of R&D in the market infrastructure space as it relates to distributed ledgers.  For example, seven exchanges survey said that they have budgeted for work in this area, with an additional 13 indicating that they are likely to do the same.  The report also suggested that some survey participants envision a product-to-market timeline taking shape over the next three years.  ""While the majority of respondents were not prepared to commit to a specific timeframe, 10 FMIs put their expected time to rollout at less than three years,"" the report said.  However, the participants were reportedly quick to temper expectations about such rollouts.  As the report notes:  ""This timeframe should not, however, be read as a blanket endorsement of the viability of DLT for the use cases under investigation. As mentioned above, FMIs are still evaluating the extent to which DLT technology will live up to its promise, and identified concerns about security, scalability, throughput capacity, and the ability to ensure data privacy.""

42427021,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJyejh,1472137283,Bitcoin Privacy Tool 'CoinShuffle' Sees First Transaction,"A type of anonymous transaction that bitcoin enthusiasts have been awaiting for years has finally been tested successfully on the network.  Sent on the bitcoin test network earlier this month, the transaction is the network's first implementation of CoinShuffle, a proposal that first generated excitement in April 2014 for building on existing privacy techniques in a way that doesn't rely on third parties.  But on 15th August, developer Daniel Krawisz sent what he believes is the first transaction utilizing this tool on bitcoin. (The transaction type was previously implementedhttp://bitcoinist.net/nxt/ on the blockchain platform NXT).  The big idea behind the technique is that it guards sensitive user information that may otherwise be visible on bitcoin's public blockchain, but the short-term goal is to incorporate the technique into the bitcoin wallet service Mycelium, which is sponsoring the project. Launched in 2013, Mycelium recently released a roadmap with CoinShuffle scheduled for ""phase 5"", or the final step, of its development plan.  Krawisz, who’s been working on Mycelium's CoinShuffle implementation since late last year, chose the name Shufflepuff for the project as a way to soften the stigma that anonymizing bitcoin techniques often carry due to their abuse by illicit actors.  Krawisz told CoinDesk:  ""It’s open source, I hope that eventually lots of wallets will use it.""  Anyone can now experiment with the tool and run it on their own computers, but so far there’s no way of bringing wallet users together to ""join"" their transactions, or mix them together so they can be anonymized.  So, adventurous users need to find other participants to ""join"" with by their own devices. Another caveat is that Shufflepuff is alpha software, so Krawisz advised it's not something users should trust with very much real money.  Technical details  Created by researchers at Saarland University, CoinShuffle is an implementation of CoinJoin, a way of mixing multiple transactions in order to confuse the details of each.  Invented by bitcoin developer Greg Maxwell in 2013, it has inspired implementations in DarkWallet, Dash, NXT and JoinMarket. But CoinShuffle is unique because it uses CoinJoin without a third party mixing the transactions in an attempt to reduce trust.  Shufflepuff is a real-world implementation of it using the programming language Java.  There are several other privacy-minded bitcoin techniques and projects out there, such as Confidential Transactions or alternative cryptocurrencies like Zcash, but CoinJoin doesn’t require changes to the bitcoin protocol, potentially making it a more practical way to bring about privacy than deeper protocol changes that could take a longer time to test and implement.  It works by combining inputs and outputs of two or more transactions into one. (Not even the recipients will know from which address the transactions originated).  But some implementations of the transaction style have problems in the eyes of those who believe in decentralization.  Since mixing the transactions means gathering other transactions to mix them with, many applications require a third party to conduct the transactions. Some believe this could compromise privacy and control over the funds, and that's what Shufflepuff helps to solve.  Big future plans  But while the first transaction is an achievement, there’s still a ways to go for the project.  As join transactions will need to unite multiple users, Krawisz is currently working on a registration system so that users can more easily link up with others, one he hopes to soon make available to more developers.  He also wants to add support for end-to-end encryption to further secure transactions.  The project is open source for wallets and other services to pick up as they wish, but how services ultimately incorporate Shufflepuff can affect the level of privacy, Krawisz argued.  He’s also outlined a plan for a model of stronger anonymity for possible implementation in Mycelium.  To that end, Krawisz called on others to contribute to the project and to write Shufflepuff in other programming languages so that it can more easily be implemented in other wallets and services.  Update: This article has been updated to specify this the first implementation of CoinShuffle on the bitcoin network.

42427043,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJyfHh,1472131297,Why the Winklevoss Brothers Are Still Waiting for a Bitcoin ETF,"Update: The Securities and Exchange Commission has extended the deadline to make a decision regarding the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust to 12th October 2016.      The Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust may be inching closer to becoming the first bitcoin ETF listed on a major stock exchange, but that potentially historic date could be further off than some might think.  Announced three years ago by investors Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust continues to draw attention, despite delays. As it would trade baskets of shares tied to real bitcoins, retail investors have long seen its approval as a boon for the price of bitcoin and the ecosystem as a whole.  It turns out, though, that even in spite of imminent deadlines that suggest approval may be forthcoming, a real decision could still be months away.  After spending two years trying to get listed on Nasdaq, the effort picked up momentum in June when the Winklevoss brothers filed to move their application to the BATS exchange. Within two weeks of that change, SEC assistant secretary Jill Peterson opened a comment period as part of the approval process.  A 45-day period that started with that filing is set to elapse at the end of this week.  But according to analysts, the publication of the form on the Federal Register didn't kick off a 45 day ""clock,"" but a 240-day countdown during which the SEC has any number of options.  ARK Invest analyst Chris Burniske told CoinDesk:  ""It’s a long and winding road and there’s a big pot of gold at the end of it and we have no idea when we’re going to get there.""  The clock  According to the notice, the SEC had an initial period of 45 days to approve or disapprove the filing. At this point, the financial regulator has the option to expand the period another 45 days, and after that, another 90 days.  At any time during this total 180-day period, the SEC staff have the authority to approve the rule-change that would lead to the trust's formal listing. But that’s just the beginning of the ""clock"" analysts say is ticking.  If the SEC staff are unable to reach a decision by the end of the 180-day period, there’s another 60-day extension during which the request may still be approved by the commissioners themselves.  In this case, that’s exactly what Burniske expects will happen, contrary to the sense on social media that the decision was imminent.  Speculation about the approval date first emerged on Reddit shortly after the initial filing. In the post, the commenters suggested a decision on the ETF itself should have happened as early as yesterday, 22nd August.  Delays and deadlines  However, since the form wasn't actually filed with the Federal Register until 14th July – six days after the SEC filing — the actual first deadline is 28th August.  If the SEC is unable to reach a decision by that date, it could extend this particular deadline to 12th October.  But Burniske says he expects the clock will tick down to a commissioner decision months from now. The decision is just too ""contentions,"" he says, given the newness of blockchain-based assets.  The fact that the SEC is currently reviewing multiple digital currency applications, and the uncertainty following Bitfinex’s decision to try to recoup the losses of a $65m hack by selling securities, he said, will also likely influence the decision.  ""The SEC will allow this to go forward when they feel comfortable and not a second before,"" he said. ""It would be a gold seal of approval for the birth of bitcoin as a new asset class.""  Bitcoin boost  Some may question the importance of the ETF, as technically, anyone who wants to invest in bitcoin already can.  But for institutional investors, there's frequently restrictions that they can only buy registered investment securities, according to Spencer Bogart, a bitcoin researcher at Needham & Company and a former analyst at ETF.com.  Bogart told CoinDesk that a bitcoin ETF would let institutional investors buy bitcoin while still complying with mandates that prohibit non-registered securities.  Two things are worth noting about this advantage. First, another key differentiator is that unlike other OTC investment opportunities, ETF investors don't need to be accredited. Second, unlike those OTC investments a bitcoin ETF wouldn't have a lengthy time commitment, and the premiums would likely be lower.  The ""knock-on effects"" of the presence of those new potential investors could include increased liquidity, which when coupled with a more diversified investor base, could reduce day-to-day volatility.  Bogart said:  ""If a Bitcoin ETF brings additional capital to bitcoin, it would likely push the price higher and drive an increase in hashing power and funding for development – both of which would serve to further improve network security which, in turn, further enables all the use cases that make bitcoin great.""  Potential risks associated with a bitcoin ETF include trust in a third-party to manage private keys, in the case the ETF custodian, according to Bogart.  ""Of course, that in itself would not be new,"" he added.    Comments closed        Other concerns related to the potential bitcoin ETF were expressed during a comments period that officially ended on 8th August.  In total, five comments were submitted, none of which called for an outright refusal of the Winklevoss application. But, each presented its own concerns.  Senior Bloomberg LP software engineer and Hyperledger project contributor, Erik Aronesty, proposed that the SEC either require the assets be insured or that the public be allowed to give daily audits of the funds.  Other comments expressed concerns about the auditability of the trust; compared it to penny stock and Ponzi schemes; and inquired as to whether it will be insured.  But those comments aren't the only reservation still being expressed by market observers.  The head of technology research at Wedbush Securites, Gil Luria, acknowledges with a strong hint of skepticism that the ETF could ""broaden the addressable market for buying bitcoin"". Yet, he sees additional waiting ahead.  He told CoinDesk:  ""The efforts to list such an ETF have been going on for three years, with no signs that any of issuers seeking approval are any closer than they were back then.""  A representative of Winklevoss Capital declined comment when reached about the timing of the SEC's decision, citing regulatory restrictions. The SEC and BATS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

42427031,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJyezh,1472124655,The Bitcoin Patent – Only A Matter Of Time?,"Ira Schaefer and Ted Mlynar are partners in the Intellectual Property practice at Hogan Lovells in New York, where they advise on patent and intellectual property issues relating to blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies.  In this opinion piece, Schaefer and Mlynar discuss whether bitcoin could be patented, and whether it would be enforceable if it was.  Bitcoin is a technological marvel that has revolutionized financial systems.  The birth of bitcoin came in 2008 in a paper entitled ""Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System"" by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto. The genesis block – the first block of transactions – was created the following year, and the network has continued ever since.  Given that no person (or group) has credibly claimed authorship of the 2008 Nakamoto paper or the bitcoin transaction method it describes, not surprisingly, no patent based on that original work has appeared.  However, that does not stop us from imagining what a patent claim on the bitcoin method might have looked like if a patent application was filed in the US before the Nakamoto article was published.  While patent claims are written to pass muster at the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), we have taken the liberty of drafting our proposed claim in simple English. We could draft broader claims to capture individual features of the bitcoin method, but find a claim focused on a collection of key features to be more useful for the purposes of discussion.  Noting that the Nakamoto paper does not use the term ""blockchain,"" but rather describes a ""chain of blocks,"" our proposed claim implements that same terminology:  A method for peer-to-peer electronic currency transactions comprising the steps of:  Creating a hash value for a prior transaction;  Combining the hash value, transaction data and the public key of a transaction recipient;  Digitally signing the combination to form an electronic coin;  Broadcasting the electronic coin to peers with a time-stamp;  A subset of peers collecting electronic coins to form a transaction block  Each peer in the subset creating a solution to a proof-of-work problem for its transaction block  Each peer in the subset broadcasting its transaction block and the solution to peers  Obtaining consensus that a transaction block is valid  Adding that transaction block to the existing chain of blocks.  Bitcoin is just that simple. It is a series of steps implemented on computers connected the internet.  If the proposed claim was filed in 2007, it should have issued in a patent by 2011, passing through the window for business method patents opened by the State Street decision we discuss below.  Legal background  Prior to 1998, it was understood that even though you could get a patent on a process, machine or manufacture, there was a ""business method"" exception. That exception would prevent you from patenting a method for performing a financial transaction. It was ineligible subject matter.  That all changed in 1998 when the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (the appellate court for patent cases) ruled in State Street Bank & Trust Co v Signature Financial Group that a claimed investment structure for use as an administrator/agent for mutual funds was, in fact, patentable.  Regarding the ""business method exception"" the court explained, ""We take this opportunity to lay this ill-conceived exception to rest.""  The State Street decision ushered in an avalanche of business method patents and, in particular, patents directed to implementing business methods with a computer connected to the internet. That avalanche was not well-received by many. Patents issued covering ""computerized"" versions of a multitude of well-known business methods.  In 2014, the Supreme Court took action in Alice Corp Pty Ltd v CLS Bank Int’l. It held that a patent directed to a computer-implemented method for mitigating settlement risk by using a third-party intermediary was not eligible subject matter for a patent.  Rather, the claimed method was an abstract idea that could not be patented. The court also specifically singled out financial business methods that implement a ""fundamental economic practice"" as being likely unpatentable abstract ideas.  But the Supreme Court left the door open by making an exception for business methods that include ""technological"" advances. Subsequent Federal Circuit decisions explained that improving the functionality of a computer qualified as a suitable ""technological"" advance.  Would a bitcoin patent be viable?  Of course, the idea of recording the exchange of currency in a ledger has been a ""fundamental economic practice"" for more than a thousand years.  The Nakamoto article admits that hashing, digitally signing, time-stamping and solving a proof-of-work problem were all known processes in 2008.  However, it cites no precedent for (a) the particular combination of processes it describes, nor (b) specifically using a hashed chain of transaction blocks as a currency transaction ledger. Viewed as providing an improved computer data structure, our proposed bitcoin method claim should be precisely the type of improvement to computer functionality that is still patentable under Alice.  By applying for the bitcoin method patent after State Street, “Satoshi Nakamoto” should have succeeded in obtaining a patent. Based on recent court decisions, it appears that patent would be eligible for enforcement today.  A patent carefully camouflaged by using terminology difficult to detect but covering some aspect (or application) of bitcoin nonetheless, very well could have issued and be enforceable. Although the open-source community has enthusiastically embraced bitcoin, ""Satoshi Nakamoto"" has not expressly returned the embrace.  That reality should give us all pause for thought and reason to be cautious. Given the incentives, let's not be too surprised that when the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto is finally revealed... along with holding a million bitcoins, *someone* holds a handful of bitcoin patents as well.
