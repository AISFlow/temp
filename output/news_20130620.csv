42424974,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHXJBh,1371740433,Thomson Reuters publishes white paper on digital currencies and money laundering,"Thomson Reuters has published a white paper detailing the challenge for law enforcement with digital currencies and how they can be used for money laundering. The paper is mainly an educational article and serves as an introduction to the problem of money laundering and digital currencies.  The paper starts by quoting the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), which is an international group involving 36 countries that money laundering is at the level of between two and five percent of global GDP, i.e. $1.38 trillion to $3.45 trillion. This is a rough estimate as, by the definition of the problem, much money laundering goes undetected.  The white paper also details the history of legal action against digital currency handlers. For example, the demand by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) of Dwolla, a mobile payment service, to cease exchanging funds with Mt. Gox, and the closure of Liberty Reserve.  The white paper also points out that criminals are not only using the relatively new digital currencies to transfer funds. The virtual currencies of online games, such as World of Warcraft, have been used to buy valuable in-game items that have then been auctioned off to other players.  Other methods for money laundering include prepaid credit or gift cards. To tackle this, it says that FinCEN is exploring ways to regulate their use, such as requiring ""travellers to declare prepaid cards in excess of $10,000 to customs officials"" (according to Personal Finance Digest magazine, April 4, 2013).  It is also reported how law enforcement personnel are struggling to keep up with the bewildering array of technology available to move money around, including but not limited to bitcoin. Thomson Reuters took a survey of fraud examiners and found that only 10% of those surveyed have worked on a fraud case involving digital currencies, and 61% feel that digital currencies will change the way they conduct their investigations.  The paper also quotes the Wall Street Journal from March 2013 when it was said that FinCEN would regulate firms that issue or exchange digital currencies. However, as we reported recently, firms are still having to ask FinCEN for guidance and clarification as those regulations have not yet been forthcoming.  In terms of tackling money laundering, the paper recommends educating law enforcement and pursuing increased pattern recognition for suspicious transactions.  It also points out how hacktivists are a ""wild card"" element. Groups such as Anonymous have a history of both battling criminals and thwarting law enforcement to protect digital civil liberties.

42424973,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHXJ9h,1371736192,Bitspend ceases trading due to frozen accounts,"The bitcoin payment system, Bitspend, has been forced to stop operations after its bank accounts were frozen. Bitspend is a service that acted as a bridge between those who held cash in the form of bitcoin, and merchants who did not accept bitcoin payments.  According to the firm, its banks (Chase and another unnamed bank) both told it that they regarded businesses which trade in bitcoin as ""too high risk"". The banks allegedly did this without notice.  Initially, Bitspend was told that its funds would be returned by cheque within 30 days. However, the firm reported, via Reddit that an employee of Chase bank told them:  ""Your account will be reviewed to decide whether the source of deposits (exchanges) is legitimate, and we will decide within 30 days if we will be returning any or all of your money""  Furthermore, Chase bank has also closed the personal accounts of the firm's owner.  If true, this represents a heavyhanded approach by assuming that businesses dealing with bitcoin payments are automatically suspicious.  The company stated that it will honour orders as soon as it can, but with the current state of affairs it cannot pay its own credit bills even though money is being deposited from exchanges.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | FIAT | TRADING,David Gilson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/06/20/bitspend-ceases-trading-due-to-frozen-accounts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/93f9c20649f455e603397b31a01e3ebb38cb7768-500x240.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42424964,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHXIth,1371726008,Bitcoin blockchain grows to 8GB,"The blockchain has now reached a portly 8GB in size. For those who don't know, the blockchain is the ledger of all bitcoin transactions, which contains the cryptographic proof-of-work of all transactions. All full bitcoin clients must download this file in order to be a bitcoin node on the network.  The obvious question is where will this end? However, if you're just using the bitcoin client to look after your wallet, there's no need to run the official bitcoin app which downloads the full blockchain. If you're just an end user, check out Electrum or Multibit as light bitcoin clients. Alternatively, you can use blockchain.info to read the blockchain in a browser.  It's likely that miners who have their rigs set up to be nodes are also on fast Internet connections, and so downloading this file will not be a serious problem, even if it increases in size several more times. However, home users who are not mining should think twice about avoiding the long download by using a light client as mentioned above.  The historical size of the blockchain can be seen on Blockchain Charts. Over the past two months, the growth has been approximately linear. However, expanding the chart to 'All time' reveals that the growth has actually been exponential. That growth rate raises questions of how quickly the blockchain will grow in size as bitcoin enjoys greater adoption.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,David Gilson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/06/20/bitcoin-blockchain-grows-to-8gb,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/401cda5ba1c1b992b26ed85e03258929464c37b0-981x537.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42424972,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHXJ7h,1371723926,Mt. Gox temporarily suspends USD withdrawals,"Mt. Gox has just announced it is temporarily suspending withdrawals of US dollars. It states it has had to take this measure in response to a growing volume of deposits and withdrawals from what it calls ""established and upcoming markets interested in Bitcoin"".  In turn, it says this has made it difficult for its bank to process the corresponding transactions in a timely manner.  The announcement from the bitcoin exchange goes on to say improvements are being made to the way USD transactions are processed and that the current suspension will last for just two weeks.  Furthermore, the company states it is still accepting USD deposits and will continue to honour withdrawals in other currencies.  Mt. Gox  has faced a tumultuous time of late. The US Department of Homeland Security recently prevented the mobile payment service Dwolla from exchanging funds with Mt. Gox. It has also faced mounting pressure from both legal and hacker sources and was the subject of a recent hoax involving a fake email referring USD transactions.  Despite all that, Mt. Gox appears to be optimistic about the future, given the exchange's recent advert in the G8 Summit magazine.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,David Gilson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/06/20/mt-gox-temporarily-suspends-usd-withdrawals,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/13f5307d4587bc62ac23d1e3c6ce5ac26816ca78-1024x768.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42424971,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHXJ5h,1371718847,Binary option brokers bet on bitcoin,"There is a new sign of bitcoin acceptance in the financial world. Two so-called binary options brokers – SetOption and TradeRush – have begun offering trades in BTC. In the press releases from both companies, there is a clear reaction to the volatility and building value of the digital currency.  On first glance, it would seem this is good news that bitcoin is a step closer to gaining mainstream acceptance. Stockbrokers are seeing the value in trading between BTC and fiat currencies. Those brokers will no doubt include the basics of bitcoin in their education pages, and thus more traders will be exposed to the digital currency.  It is telling that the stock brokers have seized upon bitcoin's volatility as a point in its favour, while many find this to be something that counts against adopting bitcoin.  In its press release, TradeRush stated:  Bitcoin trading values private currency and its rate is constantly changing and experiencing significant increases. It is for this reason that bitcoin trading has gained such recent popularity in the markets.  This confirms the idea that many people are using bitcoin as a speculative commodity, rather than a reliable currency. This in itself could harm the currency. How could someone rely on the value of a currency that is changing so frequently?  Stock brokers already handle fiat currencies, and so we cannot denounce them for speculating on bitcoin. However, bitcoin needs balance to both reward traders and to give confidence to merchants and consumers.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | SPONSORED | TRADING,David Gilson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/06/20/binary-option-brokers-bet-on-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fc52c5901da3d5d8dc6aa244096d7d7a8ec96943-496x299.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42424975,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHXJDh,1371712677,KnCMiner readies ASIC customer list,"The ASIC miner wars heated up this week, as another entrant prepared to announce who will get its first ASIC units. Swedish company KnCMiner said this week that it will be informing the first customers of their place in the delivery queue for its two mining units, named Jupiter and Saturn.  These devices will produce up to 350 GH/sec, according to the firm.  KnCMiner had allowed people to register in a queue to purchase the units, but only opened up its payment gateway earlier this month, offering people in the queue seven days to secure their place with a payment. Those paying during the first 48 hours were entered into a lottery. Three winners would get free machines.  The payment rush caused problems with its PayPal account, said the firm, slowing down the processing of payees. It has almost resolved the issue, it said this week, enabling it to announce final queue positions.  Those who didn’t get into the queue will be able to take preorders for the units on a first-come, first-served basis.  KnC  promises delivery at the end of September, which is later than its competitors. The interesting thing about KnCMiner, however, is its fabrication technology. It will produce 28 nm ASIC chips, compared to Butterfly Labs' 65 nm versions. BitSyncom, which produces the Avalon chips used by TerraHash, produces 110 nm ASICs. Chips with a higher density are more power-efficient.  KnCMiner was founded this year. The company is a joint venture between IT consulting firm Kennemar & Cole AB, and ORSoC AB, which specializes in full development services for FPGA and ASIC systems.  The two companies announced the partnership in mid-April, with ORSoC AB taking on product design, production and testing.  The key problem for companies producing ASIC chips isn't so much the design as the fabrication. Other companies that have begun negotiating ASIC designs for themselves report that it can be difficult obtaining a slot at one of the few fabrication plants available.  ""The amount we were quoted was between $1.5 million and $2 million,"" said Emmanuel Abiodun, CEO of UK-based hosted mining firm Cloudhashing. ""The foundry where you have to get your chips done needs a slot for you, and you need to make a certain number of chips to make it profitable.""  Both Butterfly Labs and TerraHash have seen their ASIC schedules slip.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/06/20/kncminer-readies-asic-customer-list,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9701d4e579b1dbde98f0bb68e47a091c41045cc9-1024x768.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
