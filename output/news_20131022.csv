42397285,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaoCMV,1382457266,"BIPS enables Bigcommerce's 40,000+ merchants to accept bitcoin","Payment platform BIPS has announced support for the ecommerce cart platform Bigcommerce, which is used by over 40,000 merchants across the globe.  The new development means businesses can sidestep credit card transaction fees by using the easy, private and cost effective payment solution that is bitcoin.  Kris Henriksen, CEO at BIPS, believes that passionate bitcoin enthusiasts will use the Bigcommerce integration to further expand the BTC economy.  “Our company mission is to provide a comprehensive carrier-grade technical platform that enables our merchants to receive cryptocurrencies as payments for their products and services online,” he said.  Merchants can use BIPS’ system for accepting bitcoin payments by inputting an API key into their Bigcommerce configuration settings. Then the business can customize certain elements, such as the bitcoin payment icon that appears via their BIPS account. The complete instructions are located on the BIPS helpdesk resource.  BIPS' bitcoin support for Bigcommerce is now up and running, but it is not actually officially sanctioned by the ecommerce cart platform. “We don't officially support bitcoin at this time. Please vote for this on our ideas site,” a company rep tweeted in response to a query from CoinDesk.  Travis Skweres, CEO of the cryptocurrency exchange CoinMKT, believes that continued adoption akin to the BIPS integration will lead bitcoin to become a major payment method someday in the future. “With 40,000 new merchants able to accept bitcoin and consumers having more options than ever, bitcoin is finally becoming the world currency we know it can be.”  Utilizing bitcoin over traditional ecommerce payments such as credit cards also opens up the opportunity for merchants to think about different products or services and various payment methods.  Ankur Nandwani, lead developer behind the BitMonet BTC microtransactions payment system, believes integrations like that now offered by BIPS could entice merchants to sell digital items for small fees. “I think it would be really interesting to see if that happens. I can see that happening for [things like] virtual goods,"" he said.  As for Henriksen, he believes bitcoin is a system of payment exchange that is much more fail-safe than credit cards and he hopes merchants will soon come to realize this too.  “The infrastructure, p2p money, and no central authority to keep this 'system' up and running, means no single point of failure,” he explained.  Other payment processors are building integrations with ecommerce platforms too – BitPay, which has over 10,000 active merchants currently accepting bitcoin, has 14 plugins available for different ecommerce and content management system (CMS) platforms. Henriksen realises he faces strong competition from BitPay, but believes BIPS' product is his company's major advantage, having undergone three years of development.  What do you think about bitcoin payment processing platforms? If merchants accept bitcoin as a method of payment, will customers actually use it? Let us know in the comments.

42397279,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaoCGb,1382450428,Hunger for bitcoin grows in Scandinavia as regulatory approach evolves,"This week sees perhaps Scandinavia’s biggest bitcoin event yet. The Stockholm School of Economics (SSE) will host a conference discussing the future of the cryptocurrency, and 250 people have reportedly signed up. Just how healthy is the Scandinavian bitcoin community?  The Scandinavian region (encompassing Sweden, Denmark and Norway) is seeing its fair share of action, both from regulators and from startups.  Michael Grønager, COO of Payward (which is the company behind Kraken), is located in Denmark, which also plays host to bitcoin payment processing firm BIPS. That country has its own exchange, Bitcoin Nordic, and the Danes are also organizing the pan-Nordic bitcoin conference, on 28th November. Even some politicians are serious about it; the Liberal Alliance party, which has nine parliamentary seats, is now accepting bitcoin donations.  Sweden has the Safello exchange, along with Kapiton, and mining hardware firm KnC Miner is there.  In Norway, Coincloud is hoping to launch a bitcoin-based cloud storage service, while bitcoin exchange Justcoin is running a zero trading fee promotion that will last until the end of the year, said CEO Klaus Bugge Lund.  Scandinavian countries have a rich history of technological innovation and economic stability. This is especially true if you include Finland, which, while strictly speaking isn’t part of Scandinavia, has close historical ties to Sweden (having been part of that country for centuries). It has some bitcoin success stories, including Helsinki-based LocalBitcoins, and at least one Finnish company stepped up to support the cryptocurrency by offering to pay employees in bitcoins.  “Finland is normally considered to be on the forefront of bitcoin,” says Lesse Birk Olesen, founder of BitcoinNordic. He added:  “Their FSA very early on declared bitcoin to be legal. My impression is that Sweden and Denmark may share the second and third place while Norway seems to have been lagging behind in bitcoin infrastructure.”  In Finland, the tax authority introduced a guide to taxing virtual currencies last month, which imposed capital gains tax on bitcoins, and taxes bitcoins produced by mining as earned income.  Other regulatory bodies across the region seem either benign, or willing to work with bitcoin. Few seem actively inhospitable to virtual currencies.  Norway currently falls into the ‘benign’ category. “As in most other countries, digital currencies and trading with them are currently not explicitly regulated. It seems like Norway does not want to be the frontrunner,” said Bugge Lund.  However, in Sweden, the Finansinspektionen financial regulator classified bitcoin as a means of payment late last year, requiring anyone who wants to create an exchange to register with it and meet the requirements faced by other financial institutions. Bitcoin.se suggests that the tax authorities in Sweden may also be ready to make a ruling on sales tax soon.  “Of all the Scandinavian countries, Sweden has a long standing history of dealing with truly disruptive technologies with companies like Skype, Spotify, Klarna and of course The Pirate Bay,” said Frank Schuil, CEO of Swedish exchange Safello, which went live with its website in August. “This has created a regulatory landscape that is very responsive and helpful towards companies like Safello. Innovation is embraced rather than rejected.”  Safello received some angel funding from Ludwig Öberg, an advisor to Safello, who is also behind IceDrill, an ASIC mining project that went to market on BitFunder this summer. IceDrill is orchestrated through Digimex, a British Virgin Islands-based firm, but managed by Öberg, who is based in Sweden. The company, one of several projects in the Scandinavian market, is waiting for ASIC mining hardware from HashFast.  “A basic definition and rule book was set early for bitcoin, and that combined with the strong banking system that is willing to work with bitcoin companies make it a great place to start a bitcoin startup or company,” says Öberg, who now serves as an advisor to Safello. Safello says it is working with two of the four biggest Swedish banks in its vow to do “everything by the book”.  Scandinavia’s regulatory approach to the cryptocurrency is evolving, but some countries are ahead of others. All of them could still benefit from a connection with the Bitcoin Foundation. ""We are in talks with folks from Sweden, Denmark and Finland, but nothing has formally materialized as of yet,"" said a foundation spokesperson. Nevertheless, its strong history with technology disruption (including mobile hardware), and its relatively level-headed banking system, put it in a good position to take advantage of bitcoin as things develop.

42397287,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaoCPS,1382436927,Win bitcoins by betting on the hash rate with Futureblock,"Volatility seems to be a key component of bitcoin. It’s still early days, but the unregulated nature of this decentralized currency contributes to its price volleying up and then down.  The same can be said about bitcoin hash rates, a measure of the currency’s overall network strength. This statistic also does its fair share of bouncing around, and although most people don't notice it, it is rather capricious like pricing can be.  Will hash rate betting gain traction?  Bitcoin’s hash rate volatility is a risk to miners who are trying to profit from solving calculations in order to create new bitcoins and confirm transactions, which results in earning a small fee. But a new site called Futureblock offers a way to bet on future hash rate volatility.  It would seem as if betting on hash rates would be a very tiny fraction of the ever-growing BTC gambling market. Ardon Lukasiewicz, who is working on a project called Bitmarkers to allow gamblers to use bitcoin in real casinos, finds it hard to see how Futureblock could be attractive to the masses.  “The site looks nice. [But] the betting isn't fast-paced enough for online gaming. I don't like these ‘binary bet’ websites in general. This subject is far too niche and complex to attract any mainstream attention. Where is the excitement in hash predictions?”  Origins of the Futureblock idea  The concept of betting on where hash rates are going will not leave the average gambler salivating, but bitcoin gambling is becoming a large market for network transactions. Betting is actually not the point here, though, since Futureblock is more about bitcoin mining than anything else.  One of Futureblock’s founders, who wishes only to be referred to as 'James', said: ""We've been watching bitcoin for a while. We bought a small ASIC miner to see what it’s like.”  After looking at the mining market, it was clear to the founders that something like Futureblock could prove to be useful. “Miners are all using the same spreadsheets when investing in mining equipment. If they are doing this, they have all gotten it wrong. It is not increases in hash rate that are wrong, it's in predicting it.”  Paramutuel betting  Various spreadsheets offer different calculations regarding the future of mining difficulty and hash rates. According to James, miners are following these predictions even though they are often incorrect, which makes it hard to actually make timely investments in mining, specifically in the hardware infrastructure.  James believes this is why Futureblock can be used as a tool for miners. The site offers something called parimutuel betting, which is sometimes also known as the tote.  Parimutuel betting pools all bets together, and odds are then calculated via all the winning bets that are in the pool. “Pooled betting means limited advantages in hedging,"" said James.  Hash rate volatility  One of the reasons that many don't notice how hash rates fluctuate is that it is more of statistic that miners pay attention to than anything else. Pull up a thirty-day chart of these numbers and you'll see just how much they change.  It's hard to understand this dynamic when looking at a one year graph of bitcoin hash rates, since that amount has increased at a fierce pace due to the advent of ASIC mining hardware.  The founders of Futureblock don't have a specific answer as to why hash rates are not more stable. ""There's so many factors in play, it's very hard to say,"" says James. ""Hash rate volatility is probably because of the mining equipment. It's based on the problems being solved, and all the machines pool together."" A combination of thousands of machines and numerous pools likely cause the rate to be in a constant state of flux.  In the end  No matter what the reason for all of the volatility, Futureblock wants to simply give miners the ability to hedge. The end goal is not just betting on hash rates, but hedging against the unknown future risks of mining. As the network difficulty goes up and mining equipment becomes more expensive, there are substantial financial liabilities in mining bitcoin.  ""The idea of this platform is not based on volatility, but more on mining. Corn futures, for example are not volatile. But corn futures are used to hedge against future prices. Our concept is to working to protect miners,"" said James.  Miners probably need it. The revenues generated from these processes that support the Bitcoin network are falling. And much like farmers, they need to be able to better plan for the future. Futureblock is a tool for that, and there is interest in this concept. During the initial launch, the site had 10,000-15,000 unique daily visits. Now it sees traffic around 2,000 per day, signaling that there is a crowd that wants to profit from pooled betting on bitcoin hash rate performance.  What do you think about hash rate volatility? What are some reasons that you think it behaves in this way? Let us know in the comments.
