42380608,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8yQL5,1524844817,SEC Official Defends 'Balanced' ICO Oversight in Congress,"A U.S. Congressman called for a ban on initial coin offerings (ICOs) during a hearing on Thursday.  The remarks from Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.) came as William Hinman, the director of the Securities and Exchange Commission's Division of Corporation Finance, was speaking before the House Financial Services Committee's Capital Markets, Securities, and Investment Subcommittee. Hinman had told the committee that his division is ""striving for a balanced approach"" when it comes to cryptocurrencies and ICOs.  Yet Sherman argued against that line of thinking, asserting that token sales are detrimental to the economy.  ""The reason for securities markets is to provide jobs in the real economy,"" Sherman remarked. ""An IPO [initial public offering] does that, an ICO does the opposite. It takes money out of the real economy.""  When Hinman began to argue that the blockchain technology that underpins ICOs ""may have some promise,"" Sherman cut him off:  ""I'm not saying ban blockchain, I'm saying ban the ICOs.""  Hinman, in turn, pushed back by saying: ""Some folks are finding that the ICO instrument allows for a different type of enterprise, one that's more decentralized, and which they think has some value.""  During his opening remarks, Sherman struck a critical tone toward bitcoin in particular, remarking that ""bitcoin is a security in that it is an investment.""  It's a notable comment, given that it's one that the SEC is unlikely to agree with – Hinman's boss, SEC chairman Jay Clayton, suggested in November that while ICO tokens likely qualify as securities, bitcoin does not.  ""When you depart from the bitcoin or the ethereum, and you get into the tokens, the hallmarks become pretty clear,"" Clayton told the Wall Street Journal.  Speaking to CoinDesk Friday, Digital Asset Research senior analyst and counsel Matt Gertler said bitcoin does not meet the Supreme Court's definition of a security.  ""The first prong of the Howey Test is an investment of money,"" he said via email. ""Considering that all bitcoin was mined and not sold for money at issuance, it is unclear how bitcoin would satisfy the Howey Test.""  Not all negative  The reception to ICOs at the House subcommittee hearing wasn't entirely hostile, however. Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) criticized his colleagues' ""ignorance about how special this area is.""  Emmer's enthusiasm for cryptocurrencies is not new – he told CoinDesk in March that the U.S. must avoid overregulating the sector.  The lawmaker asked Hinman at Friday's hearing if there were circumstances in which a token sale would be ""something other than a securities offering.""  ""It's quite hard to have an initial sale without having a securities offering,"" Hinman replied, ""which is why the chairman has noted that the initial sale of these may require compliance or exemptions.""  Emmer then asked about utility tokens, which ICO proponents argue should not be regulated as securities because they are designed to facilitate the usage of a blockchain-based network, rather than act as investments.  ""We certainly can imagine a token where the holder is buying it for its utility and not as an investment,"" Hinman responded.  Hinman went on to suggest that the SEC would take a token's circumstances into account, ""especially if it's a decentralized network.""  ""The issues around whether a particular coin offering may be a security are somewhat complex,"" Hinman told committee chairman Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-Mich.). He went on to say that his division's goal is to ""not stifle innovation.""

In late March, Bank Itau and state-owned bank Banco del Estado de Chile informed exchange Buda.com that its account would be closed. Eight other banks in the country also dropped crypto exchanges without explanation around the same time.  This prompted Buda.com to sue all 10 institutions for ""the abuse of dominant position,"" the company's CEO, Guillermo Torrealba told CoinDesk in an interview.  After the initiation of the lawsuit, Torrealba said the banks claimed that they terminated the accounts due to a ""lack of regulation, which is a very bad excuse,"" he added, since, ""they're not the ones that decide what should be regulated and what [should] not.""  The banks later shifted their position and cited concerns over money laundering.  On Wednesday, though, the exchanges achieved a victory – if only a temporary one – when the country's Free Market Court ruled that Bank Itau and Banco del Estado must reopen Buda.com's accounts until the lawsuit concludes.  The decision is a ""good sign of what the trial is going to be,"" Torrealba said, adding that the ruling has importance for Chile more broadly:  ""Basically the industry will continue to develop and it's also very important for the country, not only for the cryptocurrency industry because banks here have too much control over everything. So the fact that they can just kill an industry – a whole industry, a whole technology – just because they didn't like it is very risky for a country.""

In a speech at a fintech event in Sydney on Thursday, John Price, a commissioner of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), told the audience to expect updates that will focus overseas ICO fundraising projects targeting the country's investors.  ""We will highlight that Australian corporate and consumer law might apply – even if an ICO is created and offered from overseas. This is an important point given the international nature of this sector,"" Price said during the event.  The remarks stem from concerns over the current perception that ICOs can bypass the regulator's oversight by registering overseas.  ""I cannot stress enough that if you are doing business here and selling something to Australians – including issuing securities or tokens to Australian consumers – our laws here can apply,"" Price said.  ASIC first issued formal guidance for ICOs in September 2017, seeking to define the circumstances in which tokens should be treated as financial products and hence regulated by Australia's Corporate Act 2001.  Price said, however, that the regulator still has concerns over the emerging space's low threshold for immature businesses to enter, which drives a ""certain level of opportunism.""

The French Council of State, the body that advises the government on legal matters and acts as the supreme court for administrative matters, announced Thursday that profits arising from cryptocurrency sales should be considered as capital gains of ""movable property"" – a decision that will see the tax rate levied drop significantly, according to a report from Le Monde,  Currently, gains from the sale of cryptocurrency trading are normally considered ""industrial and commercial profits"" (BIC), while those from occasional transactions are treated as ""non-commercial profits.""  This means that tax on crypto gains can be as high as 45 percent for higher-band taxpayers, and that's also in addition to the country's generalized social contribution (CSG) of 17.2 percent, the report says.  Classifying cryptos as movable property (as the name suggests, these are assets that are not fixed in place like buildings), however, brings a flat CGT liability of 19 percent, plus CSG.  Le Monde adds, however, that the Council of State said certain types of transaction may however ""fall under provisions relating to other categories of income,"" and that proceeds from cryptocurrency mining as well as commercial activities related to the technology will still be taxed at the BIC rate.

42428998,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLr19h,1524830439,Bigger Blocks and Smarter Contracts: What's In Bitcoin Cash's Next Fork?,"Bitcoin cash's next software upgrade may be even more ambitious than its first – and that's no small feat given last time it broke off from bitcoin in acrimonious fashion.  In fact, the update, announced in November and slated for May 15, packages together a number of features that all seem about helping the network process more transactions than the original bitcoin (while adding more variety to features). Perhaps most notably, the change will quadruple bitcoin cash's block size parameter from 8 MB to 32 MB, allowing for vastly more transactions per block.  But while that might sound aggressive given bitcoin's more limited approach, those who have been following the cryptocurrency might be surprised that such an aggressive shift wasn't pursued sooner.  After all, last fall, bitcoin cash's developers chose to ignore the protests of bitcoin's more seasoned developers, who had long argued that increasing the block size and moving the cryptocurrency forward too fast could jeopardize the more than $157 billion network.  But that contrarian mentality has proved, at least partially, attractive – one bitcoin cash is going for a little less than $1,500 a coin, making it's market cap more than $24 billion.  Indeed, Joshua Yabut, who contributes to the bitcoin cash protocol's main software implementation, BitcoinABC, said he doesn't expect any protest at all when users are finally given the choice to upgrade software.  Yabut told CoinDesk:  ""Block size increases are kind of non-controversial at this point, but it's nice to see on-chain scaling happen.""  Another area where the upcoming bitcoin cash hard fork looks to scale up is through the increase of the ""OP_RETURN field,"" where users can store added data on the blockchain, from 80 to 220 bytes.  It's an easy change, but one that bitcoin cash developers say could have positive consequences, as the OP_RETURN function has been traditionally used by services that require time-stamping, asset creation, rights management and other use cases that expand the capabilities of blockchains  Return of the smart contracts  Not only did bitcoin cash developers pack in features, but they've also added back some of the old capabilities that bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto stripped from the protocol early on.  The most notable here is the addition of new kinds of smart contracts, or dynamic if-then programming statements that can give added functionality to how bitcoin cash tokens can pass between users.  In this case, the specific smart contracts in question were deactivated after Satoshi Nakamoto realized they could provide an attack vector, but bitcoin cash developers believe they've had enough time to seal up the holes.  ""Essentially out of an abundance of caution and lack of time to fully explore and fix the edge cases that needed to be addressed, the decision was taken to simply disable any opcodes around which there were doubts or even hints of doubts,"" said nChain developer Steve Shadders, in a blog post describing the features in bitcoin cash's hard fork.  It's notable that bitcoin cash is rolling these out now since bitcoin contributor Johnson Lau proposed re-adding these same smart contracts to bitcoin in February, a context that adds a bit of competition to the mix.  ""Seven years have passed and the edge cases around these opcodes are much better understood now. Additionally, the decision to disable them was taken hastily and under duress,"" Shadders continues in the blog post. ""The [bitcoin cash] community now has had the luxury of time to address these issues thoroughly.""  Yet, since there are still potential vulnerabilities in some of the smart contracts, bitcoin cash will only be unveiling a few of them this time.  Yabut told CoinDesk:  ""It's the first step for enabling smart contracts with the protocol which will allow us to compete with ethereum later on.""  The future of bitcoin cash  But while most of the bitcoin cash community is excited about the change, there has been some pushback - or at least skepticism - from a minority of users.  Much of those concerns stem from the fact that these sweeping changes weren't put to a community-wide vote before being coded. As such, some worry about the ""governance model"" of bitcoin cash, a term that denotes how developers and the miners of the cryptocurrency organize around the future upgrades.  Users, this group says, are simply not getting a chance to debate on the merits of specific changes.  Even still, the bundle of code changes doesn't seem to be so controversial it puts bitcoin cash in any danger from something serious like the network split that created it.  All software implementations of bitcoin cash, including bitcoinABC, bitcoin unlimited and bitcoin classic, have agreed to upgrade. And there hasn't been a huge uproar from miners, node, exchanges, wallets and other services, which will also need to upgrade to the new software to support the changes.  One of the reasons many feel good about this hard fork is that the developers decided to eliminate several features that were potentially more contentious.  For instance, OP_GROUP, a change aimed at launching features for asset creation on bitcoin cash, was thrown out when it became known that competing proposals for these features might be on the horizon. Yet, if those proposals don't make it to the protocol relatively quickly, bitcoin cash developers don't plan on waiting – putting the opcode up for consideration on the cryptocurrency's next hard fork, slated for October.  Meanwhile, some bitcoin cash users wonder whether the block size parameter needs to be much (much) bigger to make room for an onslaught of data-heavy bitcoin cash projects, such as Memo, a recently launched censorship-resistant social network.  As such, bitcoin cash might continue to display ambition that can't be slowed down.

The new pilot program will use the blockchain-based Food Trust Framework to track international shipments to China from Australian healthcare supply firm Blackmores and New Zealand dairy product maker Fonterra via Alibaba's T-Mall e-commerce arm, according to a ZDNet report Friday.  The news follows the platform's year-long technological development since Alibaba Australia first announced a partnership with PwC and Blackmores in March 2017 to develop the system to counter the spread of counterfeit products.  Touting supply chain transparency as a primary benefit of the framework, Alibaba said the pilot – if successful – could lead to wider adoption across the supply chains for its global markets.  The exploration marks Alibaba's latest move to harness blockchain's potential in the fight against food fraud – criminal activity that the company estimates costs the global food industry $40 billion each year, the report said.  Alibaba's T-Mall platform has already started to adopt blockchain technology in partnership with logistics firm Cainiao in its cross-border supply chains.

42428985,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLr0rh,1524824120,PBoC Researcher Touts More Centralized Approach to Blockchain,"Giving up absolute decentralization could solve many of the problems facing blockchain technology, according to Yao Qian, the People's Bank of China's digital currency research lead.  In an opinion article, published by Chinese business news site Yicai on Friday, Yao summarized the current state of development of bitcoin and blockchain technology and offered his view on how the future of the tech should play out.  While praising blockchain's key features of traceability and smart contract functionality, the research director restated his belief that blockchain's current bottleneck lies in how to achieve greater scalability while maintaining consensus with well-established community governance.  With that in mind, Yao wrote that the industry shouldn't be too rigid in sticking to fully decentralized governance, instead arguing for a more flexible approach.  The research director said:  ""We anticipate in the future there will be a new area between the two polars of centralization and decentralization. Every blockchain system will have a different level of non-centralization in order to meet the demand of different use case scenarios.""  A major issue with decentralization in public blockchains, he continued, is that there is no way to pause or shut down the system when facing an emergency requiring technological updates.  For instance, he argued that The DAO project, which experienced a notorious hack in 2016 due to coding bugs in its ethereum smart contracts, exposed a problem where decentralized systems must resolve technological issues through what he called ""chaotic"" hard or soft forks.  As such, Yao envisioned that an alliance of blockchains forming a non-centralized network, with each acting as a center of control, as a viable way for blockchain technology to grow in future – something he said is necessary for risk control and technological changes.  Yao's remarks align with statements made by other executives from China's central bank around its potential use of blockchain technology, including developing a state digital currency.  As reported by CoinDesk, at a high level, both Yao and the PBoC's vice governor Fan Yifan have previously expressed the belief that, while a central bank-issued digital currency could be inspired by cryptocurrency, it would be centrally managed and only visible to the government.

42429010,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLr1Th,1524819630,"Pullback Over? Bitcoin Retakes $9K, Eyes Further Gains","Having recovered from a five-day low hit yesterday, bitcoin (BTC) has potential for a move higher towards major resistance at $9,880, the technical charts indicate.  The cryptocurrency moved back above $9,000 in the Asian hours after the pullback from the recent high of $9,767 ran out of steam around the ascending (bullish) 4-hour 50-candle moving average (MA).  As of writing, BTC is trading at $9,251 on Bitfinex, representing marginal losses over the previous day's close (as per UTC) of $9,270.  A bearish follow-through to Wednesday's bearish outside-day reversal would have been bad news for the bulls, but BTC instead appreciated by 4.5 percent on Thursday, keeping them in the game. Had BTC closed yesterday below $8,765 (Wednesday's low), the bears would have had the upper hand for the short-term.  Daily chart  The above chart also shows the 5-day MA and the 10-day MA are trending north, indicating a bullish setup. The fact that bitcoin found takers below the 10-day MA yesterday and jumped above the 5-day MA only adds credence to the bullish nature of the moving averages.  Moreover, pullbacks tend to be short-lived as long as the short-term averages are trending north, unless there is a major negative fundamental news.  4-hour chart  BTC bounced off the 50-candle MA yesterday, establishing it as a strong support. The major moving averages – 50, 100, 200 – are trending north in favor of the bulls.  View  The pullback seems to have ended at $8,652, leaving bitcoin set to scale the resistance at $9,280 (double top neckline) and rise towards the 200-day MA located at $9,878.  Bear scenario: A failure to take out $9,280 and a drop below the previous day's low of $8,652 would establish lower highs and lower lows pattern (bearish setup) and would strengthen the case for a deeper pullback to $7,823 (April 17 low).

42428997,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLr1Dh,1524816034,"After Millions Raised, the SAFT Is Alive But Who Knows How Well","Risky and rational.  That about sums up the state of U.S. token sales in the wake of new dialogue on whether the mechanism, by which startups are issuing custom cryptocurrencies to raise funds, is compliant with the law. Lost in the dialogue, however, has been that there are many more specific types of token sales.  In fact, when developers have an idea for a distributed project, they often raise money with what's come to be called a ""simple agreement for future tokens"" or a ""SAFT."" (A method that's often synonymous with initial coin offerings, in which tokens are minted and sold directly to the public).  More broadly, the SAFT is an idea that a company that wants to build a service platform that runs on tokens can raise money by selling contracts to receive those tokens once it has been built. The contract is a security, everyone agrees, but the thinking is that the token wouldn't be once the platform is live.  Of course, crypto startups could also raise money by selling equity to venture firms, but that takes away some of their upside, and that's how the SAFT has perhaps pulled away from other competing standards.  Mark Radcliffe, a partner at the law firm DLA Piper, told CoinDesk:  ""If you want non-dilutive financing, your choices are a SAFT or try to stay outside of the US.""  Still, a lot of SAFTs have been showing up in legal filings in the U.S. of late. Intangible Labs raised $133 million in a SAFT. Privacy protocol Orchid has stated its intention to sell $125 million in SAFTs.  There have been others, too, and that's notable given the current climate.  Aaron Wright of Cardozo Law School, for example, has made a detailed case arguing that the SAFT is itself a security, from contract to token, an argument that looked prescient when earlier this year rumors began to swirl that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was going after lots of initial coin offering (ICO) projects.  In fact, many people believed the SAFT was the common thread across the cases regulators were building.  This perception that the SAFT continues to linger, even though those close to the creation of the idea have denied it. And it seemed somewhat like the token space had started to go quiet thereafter, a trend that might have boosted perception that something was amiss  Material changes did take place. Public sales to U.S. investors dwindled, for example. Even giving tokens away to regular people turns out to be a pain. The funds raised these days in pre-sales come from accredited investors only. In fact, many limit their efforts to veteran investors and funds.  But the SAFT?  ""I don't think the SAFT ever went away,"" Radcliffe said.  Judgement unknown  And key to that realization is that despite the tone of many mocking media articles, U.S. regulators have not yet publicly rendered judgement on the SAFT yet.  There's been no guidances. There's been no cases filed. There have certainly been no cases brought to trial. All we know for sure is the chairman of the SEC has expressed concerns several times in public remarks.  ""Can you convert something that's a Reg D offering into something that's not a security? It's an untested theory,"" Radcliffe said.  Like a farmer who buys a futures contract for corn. The contract is a security but the corn itself isn't when the farmer takes delivery. Can that work for tokens? Courts haven't said.  Former Commodities Futures Trading Commission Chair Gary Gensler confirmed the same this week, stating clearly that this matter remains undecided:  ""Can you put a packaging around a token, and so the package is a security and so the token later on is not. Is that alright? The SEC has not yet spoken on that, and there's controversy around it.""  So, the short answer is the industry doesn't know. Some number of ICO projects may be in negotiations with regulators now over their past offerings, but the facts and circumstances have yet to emerge.  And as we previously reported, even if that's underway it's going to take a long time to sort cases out. But considering the fact that most of these projects are served by the same relatively small group of large law firms, it is telling that SAFTs keep moving forward.  Tepid steps  So, where does this leave aspiring entrepreneurs? The first place to start in talking about the risk of SAFTs is to discuss the risks of not doing it.  Industry veteran Caitlin Long spent much of this year working to get legislation passed in Wyoming that recognized the legitimacy of utility tokens at the state level. In the course of working that campaign, she talked to companies that left the U.S. because they couldn't stomach the regulatory uncertainty here.  ""They are leaving out the entire U.S. market and that's the deepest capital market,"" she said.  Raising money just gets much harder elsewhere, Long said, never mind the other benefits of having the oldest and most entrenched tech sector in the world.  One very new startup with plans for a modest $5 million token sale to develop a more affordable type of mining chip has announced its intention to operate from Wyoming following the new laws.  Founder Charles Dusek told CoinDesk he had considered locating offshore, but he decided to try remaining here after seeing one state endorse the business model.  ""We are betting there's going to be a movement to open it up,"" he said.  The downside  So, what's the risk if the SEC does come down on this funding approach? Radcliffe and Long both agreed that criminal action was very unlikely for companies operating in good faith.  ""The nightmare scenario would be a categorical classification from the SEC that all tokens are, in fact, securities,"" long-time crypto startup entrepreneur Ryan Selkis wrote on the Messari blog recently, after news came out that major investors had met with the SEC about this new industry.  In that case, the SEC might require companies to return all the money raised. This might be an extreme analysis, though.  ""I think that the risk of the SAFT is not in the SAFT contract, but rather that the tokens upon issuance are securities which would dramatically limit their value in running a network,"" Radcliffe said.  Long added that lawsuits by investors following such a finding might be the larger risk than any specific punishment regulators might impose, but she also argued that the SEC still has some important thinking to do.  Because the ICO market has started to look like venture capital and initial public offerings' kid sister going through a growth spurt, Long argued that it's very unlikely that the SEC will make a move that would stifle this entire new industry.  Assuming a project is well-intentioned making a good faith effort to be compliant with the law, she said:  ""I think those who are taking a little bit of regulatory risk are going to be fine.""  The SEC declined to comment for this story.

42428999,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLr1Fh,1524810627,Singapore to Speed Up Blockchain Patent Approvals,"Singapore's Intellectual Property Office announced an initiative to expedite the patent-granting process for fintech-related applications such as blockchain-based payments.  According to a statement from the Office, the FinTech Fast Track initiative seeks to shorten that process from about two years to as little as six months. The program was announced during the 2018 World Intellectual Property Day on Thursday by Low Yen Ling, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Ministry of Trade and Industry and Ministry of Education.  In defining how an application can fall under the fintech category, the IP office suggested in an appendix that a technology that utilises blockchain to facilitate banking payments will be eligible.  The statement said:  ""The incorporation of blockchain technology to improve the security and efficiency of clearing and settlement across borders for transaction and payment is deemed as a Fintech invention.""  The Office also requires the blockchain patent applicants to file documents first in Singapore with less than 20 claims in one application in order to be eligible for the fast-track initiative, among other criteria.  The move marks yet another notable effort taken by the Singapore government to promote the application of blockchain tech as part of its wider push for the city-state's fintech development.  Currently, the Monetary Authority of Singapore – the de facto central bank – spearheads a cross-border payment system concept built on a blockchain platform called Project Ubin, in partnership with its Canadian counterpart.

42428988,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLr0vh,1524801624,IBM Reimagines Proof-of-Work for Blockchain IoT,"IBM is seeking to patent a method for ensuring that a network of connected devices can securely execute blockchain-based smart contracts.  As the tech giant explains in a patent application published Thursday, ""one example method of operation may include determining a proof-of-work via a device and using a predefined set of nonce values when determining the proof-of-work, storing the proof-of-work on a blockchain, and broadcasting the proof-of-work as a broadcast message.""  The problem of how to connect Internet of Things (IoT) devices using blockchain has drawn the attention of a number of developers, startups and companies in recent years – indeed, that was the central concept behind IBM's ""ADEPT"" proof-of-concept, created in partnership with Samsung and unveiled in early 2015.  An IoT-focused blockchain network couldn't engage in the kind of competitive ""mining"" that powers the bitcoin network, largely because a smart toaster or lightbulb can't harness the power of a warehouse full of specialized computers. At the same time, a large-scale blockchain mine could conceivably have an easier time of attacking a network of IoT devices and, thus, potentially compromise it.  IBM's proposed solution – described in the application – wouldn't ditch bitcoin's proof-of-work system. Proof-of-work adds a block of data – transaction data, in bitcoin's case – to the blockchain by running it through a hash function. This is a simple process; the ""work"" comes from the requirement to obtain a hash that meets certain parameters, which calls for running the hash function again and again.  Essentially, IBM explains that it would limit the number of nonces, or one-time-use numbers, within a defined range that the IoT-connected devices can employ when updating the conceptual blockchain.  That way, IBM's patent application says, ""the complexity of constructing a PoW [proof of work] can be adjusted dynamically, such that there is no incentive for any IoT device to use computing power beyond a determined threshold to increase its chances of a successful completion of a PoW.""  This system, the application argues, has the dual benefit: it averts competition among the network's devices for greater and greater computing power, and it prevents an outside actor with a high hash rate from being able to take control of the blockchain. It should, in other words, ""provide equal chances of successful completion of proof-of-work to all IoT devices in the network.""  IBM envisions applying this invention to smart contracts, with use cases such as ""peer to peer (P2P) energy networks, logistic networks, crowd-sourced weather networks, and the like.""

42421801,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXtomT,1524794117,What Crypto Investors Can Learn from Billionaire George Soros,"Tanzeel Akhtar is an independent British journalist whose work has been published in the Wall Street Journal, CNBC, FT Alphaville, Investing.com, Forbes, Euromoney and Citywire.      Recent news that George Soros' $26 billion family office is entering the cryptocurrency market has many investors speculating about the likely impact.  But one of the billionaire’s most famous ideas might be even more important to understanding how the market functions, with or without his participation.  For those unfamiliar with this powerful palindrome: In the world of economics and finance, Soros is feared and known as “the man who broke the Bank of England” when he made $1 billion in one day, September 16th, 1992 (known as Black Wednesday). This is one institutional player with the ability to go large and make or break a currency … even a digital one.  Soros has attributed his success in part to his understanding of what he calls reflexivity. In simple terms, this theory states that investors base their decisions not on reality but on their “perception” of reality.  According to reflexivity theory, there are two realities: the objective and subjective. Soros explains that the subjective aspect covers what takes place in the mind and the objective aspect is what takes place in external reality.  Reflexivity connects any two or more aspects of reality, setting up two-way feedback loops between them. In this way, actions resulting from each reality, the objective and the subjective, will affect investors’ perceptions, and therefore prices. Soros has cited the global financial crisis of 2008 as an illustration of the theory.  Markets, he reckons, are in a constant state of divergence from reality and far from accurately reflecting all the available knowledge, instead representing almost a distorted view of reality.  “The degree of distortion may vary from time to time,” Soros once wrote, adding:  “Sometimes it’s quite insignificant, at other times it is quite pronounced. Every bubble has two components: an underlying trend that prevails in reality and a misconception relating to that trend.”  He goes onto explain that when positive feedback develops between the trend and the misconception, “a boom-bust process is set in motion.” This is tested by negative feedback along the way, and if it is strong enough to survive these tests, both the trend and the misconception will be reinforced.  'Near-religious'  So, how does his theory apply to the crypto market? For starters, we do see these feedback loops.  The more people form a positive view on bitcoin, the more the price will soar, and vice versa. This is what happened late last year: when the price of bitcoin jumped, it attracted more users, which further juiced the price, which brought in more people.  Crypto markets are just as prone to the phenomena of irrational exuberance, bias or opinionated actors as any other market, said Omri Ross, assistant professor at the University of Copenhagen and CEO of Firmo Network, a smart-contract startup.  Further, the community’s famous cultishness amplifies these effects, he said.  “The reflexivity of economic actors is confirmed by the proliferation of subcultures and fan groups emerging around various projects,” Ross said. “In the young and volatile crypto markets, near-religious beliefs about price appreciation with references to various intrinsic valuation models can be observed daily.”  Another area where reflexivity applied, for a time, is in the initial coin offering (ICO) sector, where momentum drove up prices, said Shane Brett, co-founder and CEO ofGECKO Governance, a regtech startup. But it lasted only so long.  “Recently, however, discussions around compliance, not to mention fraudulent ICOs, have caused some investors to retreat,” Brett said. “Conversely, institutional investors are keen to invest in the market, but in the absence of compliance, are remaining on the sidelines, contradicting this theory.”  Nobody really knows what the long-term effect will be of Soros’ entry into the crypto markets, only months after he joined other elites at Davos in calling bitcoin a bubble. Things are about to get more interesting.  But we can learn from his insights about the circular relationship between cause and effect, and the role of cognitive function in a new, developing and volatile market.
