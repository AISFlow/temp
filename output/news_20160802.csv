42399209,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbibfr,1470178484,Bitcoin Drops Nearly 20% as Exchange Hack Amplifies Price Decline,"The price of bitcoin fell sharply today exacerbating an already ongoing decline as global market participants reacted to news that one of the largest digital currency exchanges had been hacked.  Earlier this afternoon, Hong Kong-based exchange Bitfinex halted trading after discovering a security breach, which included taking its website offline and pausing all withdrawals and deposits. Representatives from the exchange told CoinDesk engineers were seeking to uncover issues at press time, though the company had confirmed roughly 120,000 BTC (more than $60m) was lost or stolen via social media.  In response, bitcoin prices fell to $560.16 by 19:30 UTC, $530 by 23:30 and $480 at press time, CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) data reveals.  This price was roughly 20% lower than the day’s opening of $607.37 and 27% below the high of $658.28 reached on Saturday, 30th July, when the digital currency began pushing lower.  Arthur Hayes, CEO of bitcoin leverage trading firm BitMEX, emphasized that this event had a clear and measurable effect on bitcoin prices.  He told CoinDesk:  ""A high profile hack is not good for sentiment and curtails the ability for market makers to keep an orderly market.""  Market observer and trader Jacob Eliosoff provided similar input, telling CoinDesk that the event had sparked a new wave of uncertainty.  ""The big question will be how much was stolen and whether Bitfinex will make customers whole,"" he said.  Market participants traded more than 600,000 BTC via Bitfinex during the 30 days through 2nd August, Bitcoinity data reveals. This figure represented represented 1.6% of the more than 39m BTC transacted through various exchanges during the 30-day period.  The halving's impact  However, the price decline does not appear to be the sole result of the issues at Bitfinex.  Bitcoin prices experienced a gradual, downward movement over the course of several days, with market observers pointing to the halving of rewards on the bitcoin network as the cause. This event – which saw a 50% reduction in the mining subsidy on the network – generated significant visibility when it took place 9th July.  At the time, there was no major change in bitcoin prices, despite expectations that such a move may have been probable.  ""It looks like traders got a bit ahead of themselves thinking that the price would go in a straight line after the halving,"" said analyst Tuur Demeester. ""The halving is real and will have real effects.""  One such effect is profit taking. Petar Zivkovksi, director of operations for full-service bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub, spoke to this development, noting his belief this trend was ""in full effect"" after the halving.  Still, he suggested the impact could be limited due to existing market support.  ""There are still plenty of ‘stubborn’ longs open,"" he added.  Search for meaning  The drop below $600 may also indicate a change from the bullish sentiment that has so far characterized 2016.  For example, Joe Lee, founder of leveraged derivatives trading platform Magnr, stated that bitcoin's drop below $600 could indicate that the currency's long-term fundamentals are weak.  He emphasized that market observers would be watching bitcoin prices ""to see how much of bitcoin’s steady growth has come from long-term holders"".  Going forward, market observers also offered predictions on where bitcoin prices will go next. Now that the digital currency has breached $600, it will test $550, its low before the Brexit vote, said Hayes.  Tim Enneking, chairmain of cryptocurrency investment manager EAM, interpreted the recent price decline as evidence of a post-halving fallback, further stating that bitcoin will find support above $500.  Zivkovksi told CoinDesk that the digital currency’s decline below $600 “could signal the start of a medium term bearish trend powered by a strong long squeeze and a lull in bitcoin interest by the general public.”  While these analysts pointed to future weakness in the digital currency and potential declines, Demeester emphasized that not only did he not ""see any sign why this bull market is over,” but he expected the price would ""go a lot higher over the next 12 months"".

Designed to allow developers to quickly create environments in Azure, DevTest Labs seeks to help companies control costs associated with development work. Other features include reusable templates, so developers don't have to design virtual machine environments from scratch, and artifacts, which tell apps what actions to take once deployed.  The add-on already supports 26 blockchains and allows developers to create and test blockchains with lower costs than a production platform.  Microsoft’s director of business development and strategy Marley Gray described it as an easy-to-use blockchain testing environment.  He told CoinDesk:  ""With the Azure DevTest Labs integration, Microsoft has made it even easier for developers to get blockchain lab environments up-and-running.""  Blockchain projects currently supported by Azure include MultiChain, Eris, decentralized file-storage platform Storj and prediction market Augur, among others.  Using Azure DevTest Labs, developers can create ""labs"" to experiment with private, permissioned, public or consortium blockchains, functionality that reflects Microsoft’s ambitions to add ""every"" blockchain to the platform.  The DevTest Labs offering was originally available in ""preview"" mode, meaning it was excluded from features such as warranty and customer support. Offerings in preview are also able to be discontinued without notice, according to an Azure support page.

42399210,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbibgq,1470165089,Bitfinex Offline as Customer Bitcoin Reported Stolen,"UPDATE (3rd August 2:40 UTC): Bitfinex representatives confirmed 119,756 BTC (more than $60m) has been lost or stolen from the exchange.      According to a statement posted on its website, Bitfinex has suspended trading, deposits and withdrawals. Both the number of customers impacted and the exact amount lost in the breach are unclear at this time.  Bitfinex said:  ""We are investigating the breach to determine what happened, but we know that some of our users have had their bitcoins stolen. We are undertaking a review to determine which users have been affected by the breach. While we conduct this initial investigation and secure our environment, Bitfinex.com will be taken down and the maintenance page will be left up.""  The exchange, which trades a number of digital currencies, said that only its bitcoin accounts were impacted. Further, Bitfinex indicated that it may move to settle certain financed trading positions that were active when the breached reportedly occurred.  ""As we account for individualized customer losses, we may need to settle open margin positions, associated financing, and/or collateral affected by the breach,"" the statement read. ""Any settlements will be at the current market prices as of 18:00 UTC.""  Bitfinex said that it ""will look at various options to address customer losses later in the investigation"", according to the statement.  The exchange suffered a security incident last May, when its hot wallet – a wallet containing bitcoin funds connected to the Internet – was targeted. This year has thus far seen other exchange services, including ShapeShift and Gatecoin, experience losses as a result of security breaches.  Bitfinex did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  CoinDesk is monitoring this developing story.

42399201,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbibYy,1470164780,Bitcoin Smart Contract ‘Federation’ to Launch With 25 Startups,"Bitcoin smart contracts are getting their own cooperative.  Announced today, a group of international bitcoin companies have signed a letter of intent to form a federation that would find them supporting and contributing to the development of a smart contracts platform that would utilize the bitcoin blockchain.  Unveiled today, the RSK Federation is built around the RSK smart contract network created by Buenos Aires-based startup Rootstock.  Rootstock co-founder and CEO Diego Gutiérrez Zaldívar described the federation to CoinDesk as ""a huge signal from the bitcoin ecosystem"" and a validation of how companies can leverage sidechains, a technology developed by bitcoin startup Blockstream to add functionality to the bitcoin network.  He told CoinDesk:  ""The whole extension of bitcoin, and solving some of its biggest challenges with richer scripting, will solve a lot of shortcomings of bitcoin in the coming years while protecting the intrinsic value of bitcoin.""  Included among the 25 companies announced today are Hong Kong-based Bitfinex; San Francisco-based BitGo; Dubai-based BitOasis; Atlanta, Georgia-Based BitPay; Luxembourg-based Bitstamp, Shanghai-based BTCC, Toronto-based JAXX; and Palo Alto-based Xapo.  Described by the company as the first Turing-complete platform to run smart contracts secured by the bitcoin network, RSK uses a ""hybrid"" security model that combines elements of both proof-of-work (popular among fans of bitcoin’s public blockchain) and a private network.  ""The federation is going to provide several key elements and services to develop real use cases of smart contracts,"" Rootstock co-founder Gabriel Kurman told CoinDesk.  Some of the larger companies who signed the agreement will also operate oracles that would validate contracts and provide data to the network.  RSK launched its initial testnet, called Lotus, in May 2016, but is still almost a year away from having an enterprise ready solution available, according to their own timeline.  Member support  To bridge that gap some of the federation partners are getting involved beyond just signing the letter of interest.  The founder of bitcoin wallet provider Xapo, Wences Casares, told CoinDesk he believes that once RSK’s enterprise version is ready it will surpass the abilities of ethereum by providing the same smart contract functionality on top of the more robust bitcoin blockchain.  To help make that happen Casares said Xapo is ""doing as much as Rootstock is letting us do"". So far, that means signing the letter of interest, offering to provide wallets for the RSK tokens and making available the assistance of multiple employees.  Casares told CoinDesk:  ""We are their soldiers in this battle. So we take orders from them.""  While all the companies involved can accurately be described as bitcoin companies, not all of them work only with bitcoin. JAXX, for example, makes a wallet designed to work with any cryptocurrency, and BitGo provides security services across blockchains.  More than cryptocurrency  With the timing of the launch following ethereum's struggle to execute a hard fork, the announcement could easily be seen as an opportunistic play to strike at an ostensible competitor.  But Kurman said the timing is coincidental, pointing to multiple companies who plan to join the federation and also offer ethereum services.  ""Our target is to enable financial services for the poorest people in the world,"" he said. ""Going out in a rush or profiting from someone else's nightmare is not our way to do things.""  In interview with CoinDesk, JAXX CEO and ethereum co-founder Anthony Di Iorio said that building smart contracts on bitcoin would allow for a ""more robust"" blockchain ecosystem to flourish.  BitGo co-founder and CTO Ben Davenport also confirmed that his company is participating in the federation. ""Our decisions for what blockchains to support are largely customer-driven,"" Davenport said. ""But we like the Rootstock team, and the general idea of what they're trying to do.""  Kurman concluded:  ""The strong message here is that the bitcoin community is aligning behind a single goal. This is the first time in a long time that we’ve seen the whole ecosystem align in this way.""  Tumeric is the next version of the testnet, which the company expects to release by the end of September 2016. This will be followed by the launch of its ginger production network during the first quarter of next year.  While the initial letters of interest in the RSK federation have already been signed, Rootstock said the final documentation to recognize the group is expected to be completed by the end of this year.

42399214,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbibio,1470157459,PwC Blockchain Project Creates Living Audit for Wholesale Insurance,"PwC has released details on a new proof-of-concept (PoC) it says successfully created a real-time audit process for policy creation in the wholesale insurance market.  The professional services firm launched the project earlier this summer in partnership with think tank Z/Yen’s Long Finance initiative, describing it at the time as a ""high-level policy placement flow"" that would reimagine how policies could be accepted by prospective clients.  Within the proposed network itself, node participants include insurers, brokers and regulators. PwC used the Multichain platform, developed by Coin Sciences, as a basis for the PoC.  The report details:  ""An insurer can view policies on the blockchain, and make offers to back risk on a particular policy, with the broker having the ability and control to accept or decline these offers. This communication and negotiation between parties takes place all within the blockchain. When a policy is fully backed, a formalized insurance contract is created and again shared on the blockchain.""  Included in the publication was a diagram of project's design, showing the broker, insurer and regulator nodes connected to the conceptual network.  PwC indicated that the test helped yield insight into how blockchain applications can cut down on physical paperwork, streamline regulatory reporting structures and create what is essentially a real-time audit trail.  The project is one of a number of application tests being conducted both within the professional services industry as well as the broader finance world.  The past year and a half has seen projects focused on concepts ranging from fantasy sports share markets to blockchain-based banks.

42399195,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbibV2,1470138344,Why PwC's New FinTech Director Won't Rock the Blockchain Boat,"PwC's new US FinTech director plans to change little about her company's plan of attack on blockchain.  The 'Big Four' accounting firm has officially tapped former American Stock Exchange director Geraldine Balaj to help head its efforts after another blockchain director formally left last month. Joining the firm in March, she brought 22 years experience in capital markets and a drive to continue what she characterized as her firm's success in the new sector.  In conversation with CoinDesk, Balaj said blockchain services have so permeated PwC’s financial services department that it's almost hardly worth making the distinction between blockchain and other efforts.  She further laid out her vision for the future now that blockchain is well advanced in transforming the operations of her new employer.  According to Balaj:  ""I’ve lost count of how many people from capital markets and capital markets tech are involved at this point. It's fully imbued.""  Balaj led the blockchain practice at her previous employer, financial services consultant Capco, and says that in spite of the progress PwC has made, the demand from clients is requiring a new strategy.  Cross-industry clients  Balaj couldn't share the names of current clients, but noted that service providers, asset managers, financial institutions and clearing firms are all now doing business with PwC.  In particular, she said that a wide range of vendors have sought her out for advice on how they might better integrate with clients on Wall Street already building with distributed ledgers.  A general theme Balaj mentioned was the idea of ""coopetition"", where companies that might otherwise be competitors are faced with greater benefits by coming together to build distributed networks.  Balaj said PwC itself has become better at looking to non-traditional partnerships, and that her company is advising its clients to follow a similar path.  Working with competitors  Balaj says it's important for those in the industry to be able to work well with other players in the field. For example, PwC partners include Blockstream and Digital Asset Holdings, which are members of cross-industry consortium Hyperledger.  ""In many instances we’re sort of gluing the different parts together to really come up with that collaborative approach,"" said Balaj.  But Balaj says there's a possibility for the formation of an entirely new consortium dedicated specifically to accounting in the future, one that could unite PwC with the other 'Big Four' firms that have been at the forefront of developing blockchain.  She concluded:  ""There’s a lot of coopetition going on. We’ll see.""  Correction: A previous version of this article stated that Blockstream is a member of R3.
