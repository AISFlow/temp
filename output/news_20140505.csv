42425637,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIeedh,1399326619,Wisconsin Politician Forced to Return $100 Bitcoin Donation,"A politician from the US state of Wisconsin has returned a $100 bitcoin donation following guidance from the Government Accountability Board (GAB), a state-level campaign finance watchdog.  As first publicised by the Wisconsin Reporter, Alderman Mark Clear, who is running for a seat in the state legislature, returned the donation after the GAB decided to wait for a forthcoming decision from the Federal Election Commission (FEC) as to the legality of such contributions.  The FEC announced in late April that it had postponed its decision on bitcoin donations until its next meeting on 8th May. Several FEC board members have voiced support for the acceptance of bitcoin contributions under the same rules as cash and with a limit of $100.  When asked about the reason behind the state-level regulatory delay, GAB spokesperson Reid Magney told the Wisconsin Reporter:  “The Board did not believe it needed to set a policy on bitcoin because bitcoin is not one of the forms of negotiable financial instruments authorized by state law for campaign contributions.”  Roadblock for bitcoin contributions  In an interview with Wisconsin Reporter, Clear remarked that the GAB approach to bitcoin was misguided, stating:  “I think the GAB needs to focus on the important parts of public disclosure. What the public wants to know is who the person is making a contribution and how much (rather than the method of transaction).”  It’s not clear whether or not the GAB will make a decision on state-level bitcoin donations until after this election cycle.  Complicating the matter is the GAB’s lack of action on bitcoin. Some members of the board commented at the organization’s March gathering that a decision may not be necessary regardless of the nature of any decision by the FEC.  Bitcoin’s evolving role in US politics  It remains to be seen whether or not the FEC green-lights the expanded use of bitcoin for campaign donations. In the meantime, however, several US politicians have begun to immerse themselves in the world of digital currency.  Other US politicians that have already announced the acceptance of bitcoin donations classify them as 'in-kind' donations. Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, who is running for the Texas governorship, is one such candidate.  This policy toward bitcoin donations mirrors a decision by the FEC last year allowing bitcoin in-kind donations.

The release  comes amid ongoing controversy about the status of Moolah's business and requests by site users for more information about its exchange business.  The evaluation shows that Prelude had approximately 160m dogecoins (about $72k at press time) on its service, roughly 158m of which are customer funds. The company provided a link to the dogecoin block chain verifying that the funds were under Moolah’s control.  The audit was conducted internally, and according to the company, a separate third-party assessment is forthcoming.  Moolah originally confirmed it would conduct an audit of its Prelude exchange service last week via r/dogecoin and Twitter.    We will have a full audit and transparency procedure in place by May 5th. :-)      — Moolah (@moolah_io) April 30, 2014    Moolah also froze USD deposits on its service today, but indicated that this was part of a scheduled transition to its new banking provider.  The company expects USD deposits to resume within 48 hours.  Increasing transparency  In addition to the preliminary audit, the forthcoming third-party audit will reevaluate Prelude's DOGE balances. Further, a bitcoin audit of the site's funds is expected on 6th May.  Though no timeline for the third-party audit was given, Moolah CEO Alex Green told CoinDesk that the company has ""reached out to a number of key individuals to replicate the process"".  Green said that the audit has been in the works for some time and that this type of practice should become standard among digital currency exchanges. He has also promised to issue more regular updates regarding its account holdings, adding:  ""I feel personally that all exchanges should be doing this, simply to further build trust in digital currencies. People have been burned a lot in the past 12 months, and it is up to each and every exchange to regain their trust.""  Inquiries spark audit  The release of the audit was partly in response to questions raised on reddit by some of the site’s users. The postings focused on alleged irregularities in the company’s public statements and information regarding its financial health.  However, follow-up reports led to suggestions that the posting could have been part of a campaign to impact Moolah's legitimacy.  Subsequent posts on the bitcoin and dogecoin subreddits sparked a heated debate, which drew in Green and other prominent members of the dogecoin community.  Green later apologized for his statements in a blog post, and told CoinDesk:  ""I released a large quantity of information in response to the post (a Q&A), and would be the first to admit that my first reaction may have been construed as childish.""  About Moolah  Though the announcement is a step toward transparency for Moolah, which closed its second seed round in March, there are still questions about its long-term business model.  For example, the company does not charge for its services, though it says it is exploring various ways to monetize. Nonetheless, Moolah has styled itself as a competitor to Coinbase that emphasizes the popularity of dogecoin.  The audit notably coincided with Moolah's announcement that it would add ACH (Automated Clearing House) support in the US and UK.

The event, held in the auditorium space at the Plug and Play Technology Center in Sunnyvale, California, was an opportunity for job seekers to learn more about the growing digital currency industry and the varied positions the sector now supports.  Scott Robinson, who heads bitcoin projects for Plug and Play and organised the fair, said that the attendance numbers alone show a growing amount of interest in digital currencies, adding:  ""The Bitcoin Job Fair exhibited a growing ecosystem with a large contingent of the community present today.""  Major bitcoin employers  Some of the biggest bitcoin companies in the industry were on hand looking to hire talent, including Circle Internet Financial, Blockchain and BitPay.  Many of the companies at the fair were looking for software development talent, but there was also a demonstrated need for marketing and sales skills as well.  Alain Meier, co-founder of automated regulatory compliance solution provider BlockScore, told CoinDesk that his startup was looking for data engineers and developers.  By comparison, Danny Bocanegra of bitcoin wallet and secure storage provider Xapo said that it was searching for business development and marketing people to promote its consumer and investor bitcoin services.  According to Robinson, the gathered employers told him that the job fair would result in the hiring of individuals:  ""Many [companies] felt like they would be making a number of hires in the coming weeks as a result of the event.""  Increasing variety  Many of the job seekers at the fair came equipped with software development experience. But as the industry matures, positions are now available to more than just those with coding expertise.  Sarah Hody, a lawyer from the Washington, DC, area, was an example of someone from outside the coding discipline with an interest in digital currencies. At the fair, Hody spoke with companies about her legal skills and why bitcoin was a good fit for her career goals:  ""It’s an intersection of my passions, which are business, finance and international law. I see bitcoin technology changing the future of all of that.""  Dan Roseman, founder of bitcoin jobs site Coinality and a key figure helping get the job fair off the ground, said that an understanding of bitcoin's potential is key for non-developer jobseekers in the market:  ""You should know the basics, you should probably have interacted with bitcoin at some point, so you know how it works and you know what it feels like. Other than that, just be good at whatever your skill or trade is.""  Future job fairs  Roseman told CoinDesk that the idea for the job fair came from a tweet to Andreas Antonopoulos, who then put his name behind the effort and spoke briefly at the event.  The organisers are now considering holding a quarterly job fair in Silicon Valley going forward, as well as possible other similar events on the East Coast, and perhaps even in Europe.  Coinality now has more than 280 jobs on its site, many of them technical. But there is significant growth in other roles as well, according to Roseman:  ""When I started Coinality, it was almost entirely technical people. [Companies] looking for block chain experience. Now I’m starting to see marketing and sales coming in, and I see legal and regulation experts are needed.""  ""That’s like the last piece of the puzzle, I think. Once you’ve got developers and legal and then admin, now you’ve got the full spectrum of services that a company employs,"" he added.

42425633,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIeehh,1399315862,China's Bitcoin Ecosystem Undeterred by FXBTC Exchange Closure,"Despite optimism that the recent struggles of China's bitcoin ecosystem had been put behind the industry, the situation took what many in the West believed may have been a more grave turn last week when bitcoin exchange FXBTC announced it would cease operations due to what it called ""unprecedented pressure"" from the People's Bank of China.  In a statement released on its website, the China-based exchange made the case that it was a successful operation buoyed by community support, but that it could simply not compete given actions by the country's central bank that caused it to suffer ""long-term losses"" and impaired relations with financial partners.  Since the end of March, there have been continued rumours that China is looking to discourage digital currency businesses from interacting with its existing financial ecosystem, a development that has caused a decline in the price of bitcoin internationally and resulted in most major China-based exchanges reporting issues or ending relationships with financial providers.  However, speaking to CoinDesk, members of China's bitcoin community suggested that the loss of FXBTC would not be as impactful to the local ecosystem as some have feared.  Community response  Eric Gu  , co-founder of China-based VC firm Bit Angels Club, told CoinDesk that the exchange's upcoming closure has gone virtually unnoticed by the domestic community, and suggested that its demise could be positive for the local ecosystem:  ""I didn't even hear any complaint from any of my dozens of [online bitcoin groups] groups. I think FXBTC had been long forgotten.""  500 Startups investor Rui Ma further contextualized the news, telling CoinDesk that FXBTC had a ""mixed reputation"" in the community.  Gu said FXBTC traded around 20,000 BTC daily, what he called a ""decent daily volume"", though like other notable China-based exchanges it had been accused of faking these figures.  A broader market retraction  Other notable names in China's bitcoin industry suggested that the announcement was perhaps part of a retraction in a market that had spawned too many new entrants at the end of 2013.  BTC China  CEO Bobby Lee explained how FXBTC fits into this narrative, telling CoinDesk:  ""FXBTC was the first of the new crop that opened in 2013, followed by another half to one dozen. I wouldn't be surprised to see another half a dozen close shop in the next one to two years.""  By comparison, Lee indicated that only five to six exchanges, including BTC China, went online in China over the previous two years.  Further, although he expects more small exchanges to close in China and abroad, Lee expressed optimism that FXBTC would handle its shutdown in an orderly manner, adding:  ""Let's hope customers don't lose any money or [BTC] this time around at FXBTC.""  China's Global Bitcoin Summit nears  The news that FXBTC would cease operations comes ahead of China's Global Bitcoin Summit, taking place in Beijing on 10th and 11th May, and amid reports that the PBOC may still be looking to more tightly enforce its regulation of the industry.  Ma suggested that a growing pessimism is taking hold in China, and that some are starting to question the ability of major exchanges to function long term – although others like Lee remain unconcerned.  Given that FXBTC is indicative of the challenges facing these major bitcoin businesses and of the ongoing regulatory battle or digital currency in China, there is likely to be more talk at the summit, where members of OKCoin, BTC China and Huobi are all listed as speakers.  So far, the event itself is still scheduled to take place as planned, though rumors have surfaced that speaker changes may be forthcoming.

42425648,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIef5h,1399311665,Ripple’s Susan Athey: Too Much Focus on Bitcoin Exchange Rate,"TechCrunch is currently hosting its Disrupt NY 2014 conference, spiced up with a hackathon and an interesting ‘battle’ between 30 startups. Of course, no disruptive tech event would be complete without digital currencies, so TechCrunch obliged.  Ripple’s Susan Athey and Blockchain’s Peter Smith took to the stage at the event to share their thoughts on cryptocurrencies and the current state of bitcoin.  Media obsession  Athey cautioned against the media’s incessant focus on the bitcoin exchange rate.  “I think the focus on the exchange rate is a little overrated. I mean it’s fun to watch the price move around, but if I wanted to send funds to you, say, in Japan, I only care about the bitcoin exchange rate for about 10 minutes,” she said. “The level of the exchange rate is really irrelevant for its use as a transaction medium.”  We have heard similar statements from bitcoin execs in the past, but the focus is slowly shifting toward matters generally considered more important, such as VC-funding of bitcoin companies and the real-life applications of cryptocurrencies and block-chain technology.  Athey pointed out that even gold has a premium on top of its intrinsic value. As bitcoin has no intrinsic value, it’s value is solely premium, she said, explaining:  “You can think of the number of bitcoins like a pipe of fixed dimension. If I want to put a lot of dollar value through that pipe, the exchange rate of bitcoin has to grow to accommodate that volume through the pipe. If you look at the volumes and exchange rates, they track each other reasonably closely.”  She further said there were some deviations from historical trends, but it is possible to imperfectly predict the value based on the transaction volume.  Exchange warning  Asked to comment on the demise of Mt. Gox and its effect on bitcoin, Peter Smith said the overall impact will be relatively small.  However, he also used Mt. Gox as a cautionary tale, as an example of why bitcoin startups should not centralize their operation – namely their bitcoin storage. Smith said Blockchain never takes possession of the funds, always keeps its software open source and works to decentralize trust rather than centralize it.  Smith explained that centralized exchanges are vulnerable and that almost all services that have ‘centralized trust’ have suffered significant security breaches and incurred losses, adding:  “If you go out and buy bitcoins on an exchange with centralized trust, you should immediately transfer these bitcoins to a service where you can manage public and private keys.”  Smith went on to criticize the basic concept of centralising trust.  “I don’t think that business models that take away the core value proposition of the bitcoin protocol are a good idea,” he said.  The bottom line is, Smith believes startups that centralize trust are doing it wrong.

42425644,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIeezh,1399307705,"At MIT Bitcoin Expo, a Digital Currency Economy Takes Shape","Amid the frenzied construction and polished towers of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, more than 300 students, faculty and community members gathered to hear about what many at the MIT Bitcoin Expo called the world's first bitcoin economy.  The Expo was organized by Jeremy Rubin and Dan Elitzer, who raised more than $500,000 in bitcoin to distribute $100 in bitcoin to each student at the beginning of the 2014 fall semester. HackMIT, the College Cryptocurrency Network and the MIT Society of Women Engineers also contributed and will play a role in the broader bitcoin project beginning this fall.  The 3rd May event was intended, in part, to immerse attendees in the tools and know-how needed to contribute to what Bitcoin Foundation chief scientist Gavin Andresen referred to repeatedly as an “experiment” during his address.  As Elitzer told CoinDesk:  “We were aiming to make students aware of the tools and resources available to them so they can start working on projects related to bitcoin, whether that is building some sort of new product or service, contributing to an open source project, or joining up with an existing venture.”  Establishing bitcoin’s fundamentals  The first half of the day was comprised of panels focusing on a wide range of topics surrounding bitcoin. This includes the digital currency’s technical aspects, the current legal environment, and the nature of the bitcoin marketplace as it relates to consumers and investors. Following each panel, the floor was opened to questions that ranged from open enthusiasm to pointed criticism.  Alan Reiner, founder and CEO of Armory Technologies, Inc., started the day with a talk on the fundamentals of digital currency, the functions of the decentralised network and the steps of transaction authorization. Later, representatives from Armory passed out paper wallets containing $2 of free bitcoin for attendees.  Circle Internet Financial  co-founder and chief technology officer Sean Neville laid out the process by which digital currency can become more mainstream with businesses and consumers. He used the early days of the Internet to draw his analogy during the panel.  Part of Neville’s talk focused on existing global payments infrastructure outside of bitcoin. The goal, he said, is to contextualize the place of bitcoin in the wider financial ecosystem.  Getting started in the bitcoin ecosystem  Many of the panels explored topics relevant to those thinking of contributing to bitcoin projects or, at more advanced stages, starting their own digital currency businesses.  Marco Santori, chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation’s regulatory affairs committee, walked the group through the legal complexities of bitcoin, including what defines a money transmitting business and the broader regulatory environment regarding digital currencies.  Other discussions explored the elements of coding for bitcoin projects and provided insights into some of the platforms and tools available.  Andy Ofiesh, senior software developer for Armory Technologies, and Bitpay software engineer Ryan X. Charles were among those who gave talks on the more granular, technical aspects of bitcoin.  Coding and more technological involvement  Gavin Andresen's panel centered on major open-source bitcoin projects. At its opening, he expressed hope that some in the audience would one day get involved and later suggested that a good way for students to get involved is to help the developers review code.  His discussion contained a few interesting anecdotes as well as technical information, such as the fact that, by his estimates, just 30% of bitcoin software creator Satoshi Nakamoto’s existing code still exists in its original form.  Andresen later fielded a number questions that covered a wide-range of topics including alternative proofing systems such as proof-of-stake and the challenges facing new implementations of the Bitcoin protocol. He was also asked about past outages in the network and how the core development team has evolved since that time.  At the end of the question-and-answer segment, Andresen touched upon the idea of experimentation and how it relates to the MIT bitcoin distribution and digital currency as a whole. Said Andresen:  “If an experiment fails, it was an experiment, right? I think as long as you’re clear about expectations, it’s okay to take risks.”  A full recording of the MIT Bitcoin Expo can be found here.

42425636,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIeelh,1399305492,VC Fred Wilson: Block Chain Could be Bigger Opportunity than Bitcoin,"Speaking at TechCrunch Disrupt on 5th May as part of the conference's opening fireside chat, Union Square Ventures founder and bitcoin enthusiast Fred Wilson opened up about the kinds of digital currency investments that he and his firm are currently considering.  Despite a suggestion that Wilson may be interested in some of the larger names in the space like Coinbase, the MIT and University of Pennsylvania graduate indicated that what is perhaps most intriguing to him is the long-term impact of the bitcoin block chain.  While he did note that his interest remains strong in bitcoin and related companies and services, he said that the bitcoin protocol has perhaps far bigger ramifications in key fields like Internet identity:  ""Right now you need someone to be the arbiter of identity – either Facebook, Twitter or Google – somebody who developers can use for login and other information sharing. I think you could do the same thing with a block-chain architecture, where there is no third party, there is no clearinghouse of identity information.""  More details  While he did not release any new information about prospective projects, Wilson was confident that a worthy player would emerge from the digital currency community to disrupt the online identity space.  Notably, one company that received a namecheck was OneName, an open-source platform provider that uses both the bitcoin and namecoin block chains with the end goal of providing a new kind of identity service to developers.  That project launched in late March and gained more publicity for its primary use case, simplifying bitcoin addresses with usernames.  Mitigating expectations  Though Wilson has been one of the more outspoken VCs about the potential of bitcoin and the wider industry, at the conference, Wilson moved to downplay expectations that he would perhaps be seeking to encourage growth through upcoming investments.  Rather, Wilson indicated that Union Square Ventures would continue its current approach to the wider tech space with the bitcoin industry by refraining from early seed-round investments:  ""We're not going to invest until we see real uptake.""

42425643,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIeexh,1399289783,Australian VC Company Future Capital Launches $30 Million Bitcoin Fund,"Australia-based VC firm Future Capital has launched a US$30m global investment fund for bitcoin companies called the Future Capital Bitcoin Fund (FCBF).  The firm – which is led by Domenic Carosa, a tech entrepreneur turned investor – says it is Australia’s first dedicated investment fund for the digital currency.  The FCBFhttp://www.futurecapital.com.au/ is expected to go live this month and it is currently accepting investments in AUD, USD, RMB and BTC. Future Capital is also looking for companies interested in receiving funding.  “Bitcoin has the potential to dramatically alter the manner in which transactions take place across the globe and the power to create new modes of financial connectivity, seamlessly across borders,” said Carosa.  Impressive track record  Although the firm is new to the world of bitcoin, the fund is staffed by experienced investors with a good track record in the tech space.  Future Capital says its team has over 50 years of collective investment fund management experience and that it has been involved with more than 100 start-ups in previous funds, which have received more than $150m in investment. The team now hopes to replicate that success in the field of digital currencies.  Applicants will be managed by Holger Arians and Remco Marcelis, seasoned investors and tech company executives.  Arians said cryptocurrencies are the most disruptive innovation he has witnessed in the last decade and that bitcoin could change the way people live, travel and do business.  “We view the emerging bitcoin ecosystem as an investment opportunity that has transformative potential across a raft of social, technology-based and cultural applications and we see great scope for the broader adoption of bitcoin and its related applications to redefine the global payment status quo,” Carosa added.  The team will promote the fund at the Global Bitcoin Summit in Beijing from 10th-11th May and the European Bitcoin Conference in Amsterdam from 15th-17th May.  Why Australia?  Future Capital says Australia was chosen due to low sovereign risk and its globally recognised financial system. Carosa argues that an Australian-based fund is an exciting opportunity for global investors interested in the bitcoin ecosystem.  The Australian financial sector has a relatively good reputation and the country’s legislative framework has a lot in common with other Western systems. Australia is in a rather exotic location, perhaps, but it is regionally adjacent to major Asian financial hubs. Relative proximity still matters, even in a digital economy.  As a result, the FCBF is not exactly the first bitcoin-related investment operation in Australia.  Earlier this year Macro Energy acquired Digital CC and became the first bitcoin company listed on the Australian Stock Exchange. However, Macro Energy is not an investment fund; instead aiming to make its money on mining operations and retail-focused bitcoin solutions.

42425646,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIef3h,1399282681,Localbitcoins Shrugs Off Security Breach,"Digital currency exchange Localbitcoins suffered a security breach over the weekend, but was quick to respond by taking the site offline and reassuring clients that their bitcoins and user data are safe.  The exchange described the attack as “very dangerous” and said it targeted the site infrastructure.  The breach occurred on Sunday and allowed the intruder to briefly gain access to the server console.  Hosting weakness  The attack appears to have been carried out with some good old-fashioned social engineering. Localbitcoins explainedhttp://localbitcoins.blogspot.com/2014/05/attack-against-localbitcoins.html:  “Localbitcoins hosting received a request to restart the LocalBitcoins.com website server and give access to the server console (root) on Sat May 3 13:32:27. Localbitcoins team did not initiate this request. For now, it looks like the request was made using spoofed email addresses and other weakness in the hosting provider support system.”  The Localbitcoins team was quickly alerted and the attacker had root access for about 40 minutes. Data was not compromised, however, as it is encrypted and manual actions are required for access.  “It is very unlikely that the attacker gained access to any data; Localbitcoins is still performing full investigation on the matter,” the company said.  All bitcoins stored in the Localbitcoins hot wallet and cold wallet are safe and are hosted on a separate server.  The team apologised for the outage and said it would take about 24 hours to resolve.  Popular targets  Bitcoin exchanges are a big, juicy target for hackers. Running a successful bitcoin service is a bit like painting a huge bullseye on your business, so, like most bitcoin exchanges, Localbitcoins has been down this road before.  The exchange faced a PR crisis back in April, when one user reported a wallet breach. Following an extensive investigation, Localbitcoins concluded that the attack was carried out only after the attacker gained access to the user’s mobile device – apparently via malware – not through the exchange.  This time around Localbitcoins was indeed the target, but the company's safeguards seem to have foiled the attack.

42425639,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIeeph,1399264366,Department of Defense to Investigate Bitcoin's Terrorism Potential,"An office within the US Department of Defense is conducting a study into bitcoin and other technologies as a potential terrorist threat, according to news reports.  The move is part of the Combatting Terrorism Technical Support Office (CTTSO) programme aimed to assist the military in understanding if and how various new technologies might be used to threaten US national security.  The news first appeared on investment consultant Bruce Fenton's blog on Friday, with a link to CTTSO's request for vendors to apply as information sources.  Before bitcoin fans get too alarmed, however, the CTTSO's list of technology keywords is over 250 lines long and includes Android, Motorola, social media and virtual reality.

Bitcoin as a terrorist aid is a familiar trope in regulatory circles by now, to the point where it is mentioned almost as casually as 'Silk Road' in reports wishing to highlight digital currency's downsides.  The idea of an instantaneous, almost-anonymous and difficult-to-trace payment network is bound to get attention from any government that uses payment surveillance as a crime-fighting tool.  The strict KYC and AML (know your customer and anti-money laundering) rules governing the world's financial institutions, and attempts to stamp out other near-anonymous transfer systems such as hawala, are proof that comprehensive international payment tracking is something the authorities value highly.  Treasury investigations  The Department of Defense is also not the first US government branch to take an interest in how terrorists might use digital currencies. The Department of the Treasury has conducted its own investigations into bitcoin, but downplayed any threat both in November and March.  Bitcoin, it said, was too volatile in value and limited in utility to be of use to terrorists, who generally preferred 'real' money anyway.  Since these factors are also a barrier to widespread bitcoin adoption in the mainstream economy, governments will likely be watching digital currency developments for some time to come.

42425616,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIebbh,1399259842,Fidor Becomes First Bank to Use Ripple Payment Protocol,"San Francisco-based decentralized payment network provider Ripple Labs has announced that German Internet direct bank Fidor is now using the Ripple protocol as part of its transaction infrastructure.  With the announcement, Fidor has become the first bank to integrate Ripple's payment protocol, allowing its customers to instantly send money in any currency in any amount through the bank's money transfer products at a lower cost.  The move is significant as it will allow Ripple to showcase how its unique open-source approach to payments can be used by banks to replace many of the common intermediaries in the industry, thereby passing on savings to partner institutions, and by extension, their clientele.  Matthias Kröner, CEO of Fidor Bank, elaborated on the benefits of the new partnership, stating:  ""Ripple enables us to securely and instantly send money anywhere in the world at no additional cost and through the same customer facing products and relationships we offer today.""  The news follows Ripple's most recent high-profile addition to its team, when it revealed in April that Stanford professor of economics Susan Athey would join its board of directors after previously serving as an advisor.  More details  With the move, Fidor customers will continue to engage with Fidor and its products in a similar manner, as they are not required to hold separate Ripple accounts. Fidor offers its Fidor Smart current account, a product that incorporates traditional bank account functionality with Internet payments and banking services.  On the business side, Fidor will also harness Ripple's protocol for intra-bank payments between its German banks and partners in other countries to lower the costs associated with settlement and foreign exchange risk. It says the move will have the long-term benefit of allowing it to more seamlessly interact with other banks utilizing Ripple's network.  The German bank has been lauded for its focus on e-commerce and the mobile Internet, and has openly spoken about its efforts to distance its offerings from traditional banks.  Boost for Ripple  The move can also be seen as a boon for Ripple, which has taken a different approach to bringing the benefits of bitcoin-like technology to payment and remittance networks and exchanges, building a community of developers, investors and financial companies that are focusing on creating a currency-agnostic payment mechanism rather than an alternative currency.  Speaking about the announcement, Ripple Labs' CEO Chris Larsen also suggested the move is a validation of his company's approach to open-source payments:  “As an innovator and leader in the banking industry, Fidor is using Ripple to define a new standard for what a bank can be and how it can serve its customers.”  To learn more about Ripple labs, its architecture and its role in digital currency ecosystem, read our most recent report on the company here.
