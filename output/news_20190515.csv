42430489,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMvGzh,1557951014,2020 Presidential Hopeful Andrew Yang Says Regulators 'Owe' Clarity on Rules for Crypto Industry,"Presidential contender Andrew Yang took the stage at Consensus 2019 on Wednesday, facing a friendly (if not slightly boisterous) crowd as he discussed bitcoin, blockchain and his bid for the White House.  Amid jokes about a possible YangCoin, Yang essentially pitched himself as a sympathetic friend of the crypto community in an appearance that came weeks after his campaign issued a policy statement on digital asset regulation.  He also opined on the declining influence of traditional media, the threat of climate change, his Freedom Dividend pitch, and current U.S. president Donald Trump (""The opposite of Donald Trump is an Asian candidate who likes math."")  As CoinDesk reported in April, Yang promised ""clear guidelines in the digital asset world so that businesses and individuals can invest and innovate in the area without fear of a regulatory shift,"" a position that he reiterated during his onstage conversation with Coin Center's Neeraj Agrawal.  He argued that the current framework in the U.S. is unclear and unfair to people working with the technology, saying:  ""If you’re a builder it’s just ‘look, tell me what the landscape’s going to look like and we’ll figure it out from there’ but no one knows what the landscape will look like.""  For the record, Yang told CoinDesk after his talk that he doesn't own any crypto but that he has some funds in a vehicle which has some crypto holdings.  On regulators' practice of setting policy through enforcement actions rather than issuing guidance, Yang told CoinDesk:  ""I think it's unfair to folks and I think it's a clear emblem of the U.S.'s approach, and [customers] ask 'what the heck' ... It's one thing that they [regulators] come down when there's clear guidelines [but there aren't in crypto]. So the regulators owe us some degree, owe the community some degree of clarity.""  Similarly, Yang acknowledged the digital privacy concerns that motivate many crypto users, telling the audience: ""I'm sympathetic to members of the community who want to have more of these transactions occur in a non-monitored manner or context.""  Yang also offered some more light-hearted advice for crypto advocates. ""Don't eat, sleep and breathe [crypto] too much. Every once in a while go on a hike,"" drawing laughs and a response from Agrawal: ""I guess I should do that.""  'One of the key technologies'  Looking ahead to his possible occupancy in the White House, Yang called blockchain ""one of the key technologies"" that he envisions forming part of a next-generation economy, and reiterated that he would be a friend to the industry should he prevail in the 2020 vote (not to mention the crowded Democratic Party primary, which begins in earnest this summer when the official debates begin).  ""The work you're doing is difficult...but it is the future,"" he said. ""If I'm in the White House oh boy are we going to have some fun.""  In the follow-up interview, Yang also highlighted the question of how tokens are classified (whether they're commodities, securities, or something else), and reckoned that his push for clarity would in part focus on this area specifically.  Speaking to CoinDesk after the appearance, Agrawal struck a positive note about Yang's perspectives on the technology and the regulatory hurdles the industry faces.  ""It was remarkable to see a candidate think through the cryptocurrency policy issues as deeply as Andrew Yang has, and I think this bodes well for cryptocurrency leadership,"" he said.

42430486,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMvGxh,1557948617,Study Finds Most Ransomware Solutions Just Pay Out Crypto,"A study by ProPublica found that most ransomware solutions providers have one weird trick for getting rid of hackers - paying them off.  Ransomware activity is growing weekly according to experts at Coveware . The result? Companies who just want to pay the ransom and move on.  According to Coveware, ransomware attacks were up in Q1 2019:  In Q1 of 2019, the average ransom increased by 89% to $12,762, as compared to $6,733 in Q4 of 2018. The ransom increase reflects increased infections of more expensive types of ransomware such as Ryuk, Bitpaymer, and Iencrypt. These types of ransomware are predominantly used in bespoke targeted attacks on larger enterprise targets.  Once hackers encrypt an infected computer, however, the real question is how to unlock your data. ProPublica found that many data recovery firms simply pay the ransom and then charge a premium for their trouble.    Proven Data promised to help ransomware victims by unlocking their data with the “latest technology,” according to company emails and former clients. Instead, it obtained decryption tools from cyberattackers by paying ransoms, according to Storfer and an FBI affidavit obtained by ProPublica.      Another U.S. company, Florida-based MonsterCloud, also professes to use its own data recovery methods but instead pays ransoms, sometimes without informing victims such as local law enforcement agencies, ProPublica has found. The firms are alike in other ways. Both charge victims substantial fees on top of the ransom amounts. They also offer other services, such as sealing breaches to protect against future attacks. Both firms have used aliases for their workers, rather than real names, in communicating with victims.    Going up  Ransomware is getting worse.  After US Attorney General traced and indicted two Iranian hackers for releasing ransomware called SamSam, authorities hoped the prevalence of attacks would fall. Instead, it rose, beating 2018 levels considerably.  The reason, many believe, is because ransomware is so lucrative. Hackers can launch an attack and then, when the victims discover the hack, they negotiate briefly with companies like MonsterCloud and others to unlock the computers. However, many of these companies offer recovery methods and many security researchers work on free methods this one for the popular WannaCry ransomware.  Unfortunately, the hacks are getting worse and the software necessary is getting more complex.  Coveware admits  to actually negotiating with scammers. They've found it to be one of the simplest methods for getting data back. The concern, however, is that these efforts are inadvertently funding terrorism. Further, they write, it is taking longer to decrypt hacked computers, thanks to new versions of the ransomeware. In Q1 2019, wrote Coveware, the ""average downtime increased to 7.3 days, from 6.2 days in Q4 of 2018.""  Pattern recognition  Coveware CEO Bill Siegel has found that the average ransomware recovery isn't really a negotiation with ""terrorists"" as US Government officials believe. They've negotiated a ""few hundred"" ransomware cases this year and find that each hacker is different and often just frustrated.  ""Our sense based on our study of the industry and experience is that the vast vast majority are relatively normal people that don't have legal economic prospects that match their technical abilities,"" Siegel said. ""They also live in parts of the world that are beyond the jurisdiction of Western law enforcement, and are ambivalent about stealing from the West.""  Their process for talking with the hackers is also quite precise.  ""We study their communications patterns so that we can build up a database of experience. There is a surprisingly small group of threat actors that are active at any given time, so identifying them is relatively straight forward. From there, we have scripts and tactics that we have honed over our experience. We draw on those to develop a negotiation strategy on behalf of our client. We know the hackers based on the profile and patterns they exhaust. We don't communicate with them outside of representing our clients in a negotiation. All of the data exhaust we create from our cases is provided to law enforcement on a quarterly basis as well.""  Zohar Pinhasi of MonsterCloud said his company worked hard to use both methods - recovery and ransom.  The recovery process varies from case to case depending on the scope and nature of the cyber attack. Our methods for achieving data recovery and protection are the product of years of technical experience and expertise and we do not disclose the process to the public or to our customers. That is communicated clearly up front. However, what I can tell you is that we are a cyber security company, not a data recovery company. We have vast knowledge and experience dealing with these criminals, and we spend countless hours staying atop their evolving methods in order to provide our clients with protections against all future attackers, not just the one infiltrating their data at the time they come to us. We offer a money back guarantee to any client if we are unable to recover their data, and to date we have not had a single client report a follow-up attack from the same criminals or any other attacker.  While sending a few thousand BTC to a strange address might not sit well with many victims, it still looks like the best way to reduce downtimes. After all, it's the organization's fault for catching the ransomware bug in the first place. Prevention, as they say, is often better than the cure.

42430488,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMvGvh,1557938465,Bitcoin Cash's Scheduled Hard Fork Tripped Up By Software Bug,"A system-wide upgrade otherwise known as a hard fork appears to have split the bitcoin cash network in two.  Bitcoin Cash is the fourth largest cryptocurrency in the world and possesses a market capitalization of over $6 billion. The chain split occurred after the bitcoin cash network tried to upgrade to new software at block number 582,679, according to data from BitMEX Research's Forkmonitor tool.  As noted by a user on Reddit, one version of the software by bitcoin cash developer group – Bitcoin ABC – carried a code bug affecting the bitcoin cash mempool that was unrelated to the upgrade itself.  Similar to the bitcoin blockchain, bitcoin cash requires miners to validate transactions and append new blocks. The mempool consists of all pending transactions on the blockchain awaiting approval by a miner.  As stated by Reddit user ""FerriestaPatronum"":  ""Looks like there was a small bug in the mempool-acceptance rules for after the [hard fork]...From what I currently understand, it looks like the operation count was being validated with the old rules, not the new one.""  Since then, however, developers have released new code to fix the bug. According to data from CoinDance and comments from observers, the bug resulted in a string of empty transaction blocks prior to the fix.  Vin Armani – CTO of bitcoin cash application CoinText – reaffirmed to CoinDesk: ""Blocks were going in empty for about an hour and a half. Now the mempool is clear and transactions are going into blocks normally. All is back to normal.""  Yet it is unclear at this time how many nodes – that is, computer servers running Bitcoin ABC software – have upgraded to the fixed software.  In response to the issue, crypto exchange Poloniex announced that it was pausing withdrawals and deposits in light of the hard fork issue.  To this, Poloniex Exchange tweeted:  ""BCH had an issue with the planned hard fork scheduled for today. As a result, we have disabled deposits and withdrawals for BCHABC until further notice. BCH core developers are working on it. Thank you for your patience.""  A form of centralization  According to the R&D team of mining and pool operations for blockchain startup Navier, the majority of bitcoin cash miners use Bitcoin ABC software as opposed to other bitcoin cash software implementations such as Bitcoin Unlimited (BU).  “The majority of bitcoin cash miners use the ABC client rather than the BU client, so people were creating transactions and submitting them to the mempool faster than they could be written to a block and most of those blocks were empty, “ explained David Steinberg, the vice president of Navier.  Steinberg emphasized that having a diversity of software implementations could prevent similar glitches in code from tripping up the blockchain network.  Steinberg told CoinDesk:  “Having a single type of node is a form of centralization - you're trusting the codebase from the node type you've selected to keep working as expected. Ideally, miners would have multiple types of node available to submit to in case something like this happens again.”  Having “singularly popular protocol implementations,” according to Steinberg, are especially dangerous during hard forks.  “The fact the introduction of this bug coincided with the hard fork exacerbated the issue, since you must upgrade your node to participate in the fork,” explained Steinberg. “For normal incremental updates, not every node will be up to date as quickly, so a problem like this is more likely to affect only a small number of miners.”  As such, Steinberg concluded:  “I'd say the biggest takeaway here is that programmers make mistakes, and that even decentralized systems can be affected in unexpected ways by the tiniest bits of centralization, like relying on a single codebase.”  This is a developing story and will be updated. The excerpt of this story has been updated to clarify that the code bug was unrelated to the hard fork code itself.

42430484,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMvGth,1557936079,World's Fifth-Largest Electrical Company Is Using an Ethereum Dapp,"One of the world's largest electrical companies is teaming up with ethereum app iExec on a new test.  EDF, the fifth largest electrical utility company with a $33 billion market cap, has launched its visual simulator software GPUSPH on iExec, a decentralized application that operates on ethereum mainnet. With this, EDF can test how the program operates on a blockchain rather than a more normal computing environment.  Specifically, the simulator explores a field called ""smoothed particle hydrodynamics"" for modeling fluids. It's technical in nature, but the general idea is that the GPUSPH application is useful for studying all sorts of things, like water dams, for example, or even lava cooling. EDF is trying to determine whether ethereum adds any benefits to the simulator, which typically runs on a GPU.  As EDF blockchain engineer Gilles Deleuze told CoinDesk:  ""In a wider perspective, [...] development of distributed computing is a credible scenario for the future, and blockchain may be a nice lever in this scenario. So, let’s explore it.""  Originally an extension of a decade-old research project, iExec is one of the longer-running ethereum apps, launched in 2016 to explore the concept of cloud computing on the blockchain. While the world of cloud computing is currently dominated by large companies, like Amazon, they're trying to decentralize the form of computing on ethereum.  iExec head of innovation and adoption Jean-Charles Cabelguen argued to CoinDesk that the advantages of using iExec for GPUSPH are many, including clear monitoring of the state and computational power of the app and increased ""resilience"" of the app, as it's running on a decentralize network.  But perhaps one of the most pressing problems ethereum faces is that it doesn't scale well, at least not yet. But iExec argues they've come around with their own scaling solution to at least ensure their dapp is scalable.  ""The heavy computing is done off-chain and does not overwhelm ethereum. Afterward, blockchain is used to reach a consensus on the validity of computation’s results. A hash of this result is stored on the blockchain,"" Cabelguen said.  That said, EDF thinks the technology is worth exploring. Deleuze even added that EDF plans to launch other experiments on iExec in the future, stating:  ""The plan is to continue with other open scientific codes requiring possibly other types of workerpools.""

42430494,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMvH9h,1557935435,Blockchain Project Thundercore Releases Code for 'Pala' Consensus Protocol,"Public blockchain platform provider ThunderCore has just released proof-of-concept code for a new consensus protocol, dubbed Pala, on GitHub.  According to Elaine Shi, chief scientist for ThunderCore, the work represents ""a dream consensus protocol.""  As stated on the newly released GitHub page:  ""Pala is a byzantine fault tolerant consensus protocol...It can achieve low latency and high throughput in a partially synchronous network setting.""  In layman terms, for blockchains that use a system of block creation and transaction validation known as proof-of-stake (PoS), Pala is way in which to switch out certain bad actors from the network without sacrificing speed or liveness.  ThunderCore was previously reported by VentureBeat to have raised $50 million in their pursuit of a highly-scalable PoS blockchain. The startup's public blockchain network, also called ThunderCore, launched this month and is fully compatible with applications running on the world's second largest blockchain platform, ethereum.  The ThunderCore blockchain also leverages the ethereum network for chain finality.  On the newly released ThunderCore blockchain, bad actors in the PoS system are detected and switched out by leveraging finality on the ethereum blockchain. The ethereum blockchain essentially acts as a network for the ThunderCore blockchain to fall back on should consensus be broken.  However, confirmations of blocks and transactions on the ethereum blockchain takes roughly 10 minutes to generate, according to Shi.  ""When we want to use the slow chain for the fall back detection...we are going to suffer from slow chain confirmation times,"" said Shi. ""This is what ThunderCore is doing right now.""  With Pala, ThunderCore is able to rotate out bad actors without touching the ""fallback"" chain. Shi emphasized that Pala will be integrated into ThunderCore's mainnet network once fully tested.  Shi told CoinDesk:  ""Open-sourcing the Pala protocol is an important milestone for us. It means other projects can use the protocol for other blockchain platforms if they need fast consensus.""

In an on-stage discussion at CoinDesk’s Consensus 2019 event on Wednesday, Armstrong was asked by panel moderator and Wall Street Journal reporter Paul Vigna about the status of institutional involvement in the cryptocurrency industry.  Armstrong replied:  “We launched our custody 12 months ago, we’ve just crossed $1 billion AUM or institutions, 70 institutions have signed up, adding about $150 million AUM a month, so, to a large degree that has been a success.”  He added the institutions are not merely interested in having their funds sit idle while in custody either.  “They want to be staking and voting, doing governance on-chain,"" Armstrong said. ""I think that will grow rapidly.”  He also noted bitcoin is still the main asset of interest for institutions, but the interest for other cryptocurrencies is growing, too, so Coinbase currently offers services for 30 coins for institutions, including staking-as-a-service for some.  Both panelists, Armstrong and Union Square Ventures partner Fred Wilson, noted the institutions involved are not necessarily the big, traditional players most are familiar with, such as BlackRock.  “The token funds and venture funds will make up the first two big institutional funds,"" Wilson said. ""For them [traditional institutions] to take their chips and go all in, I don’t see that in the next year or two.”  Wilson added:  “When people read in the Wall Street Journal that institutions are coming to crypto they think Goldman is coming, but in reality, maybe 100 token funds in the U.S. and 100 in Asia are all in so far.""  The Coinbase trading platform geared toward more advanced traders, Coinbase Pro, is seeing notable institutional involvement as well, Armstrong said, with more than half of its trading volume now coming from said institutions.  “Sixty percent of our trading volume is from institutions,” Armstrong said.  While so far a success, Coinbase being the sole custodian of user funds is not the exchange's end goal.  Armstrong envisions users themselves taking a more active role in the custodial process, stating:  ""I would love to be in a world where people could self-custody ... and still participate in exchanges, we're talking to people at StarkWare about that.""

The app will allow users to issue and manage security tokens on top of the Liquid Network.  ""Businesses around the world are racing to take advantage of the tokenization of securities,"" Blockstream CSO Samson Mow said in a statement, adding:  “Unfortunately, blockchain platforms like ethereum are failing them due to issues with scaling, privacy, and reliability. [...] Now, with the launch of Liquid Securities, businesses can quickly issue Liquid-based security tokens with the click of a button, and establish sophisticated rulesets to conform with their regulatory requirements with no engineering experience required.”  A few partners are lining up to launch coins on the platform already, including BnkToTheFuture, TokenSoft, Zenus Bank, and Pixelmatic.  You might think you have to be a coder to launch a token. But the Liquid Securities platform will provide a web interface, like the one you're on right now, on which businesses can issue and monitor tokens. To create one, instead of coding up the rules, the app will feature options to set up the rules, such as regional restrictions and ""investor accreditation.""  Under the hood, they'll be enforced by bitcoin's multi-signature smart contracts.  And to deal with the question of regulation, especially seeing as regulators are starting to crack down on tokens in the space under securities regulations, Blockstream will also offer a Liquid Securities API for ""additional compliance and legal services.""

InfStones, which was founded in 2018 and operates as a full node and block producer for PoS blockchains, said it will use the new equity financing to expand its existing five-person team and bring its service to additional PoS chains.

Currently, the firm is a block producer for nine PoS blockchains including EOS, Tron, Cosmos and Tezos. The company aggregates PoS token holders’ votes to participate in the block producing process of PoS chains in order to receive mining rewards.  InfStones then distributes these rewards to holders who cast votes but takes a 10–30 percent commission, depending on the design of the different chains.  For instance, ranking data for the EOS blockchain shows InfStones' full node has over 90 million votes, staking over $450 million worth of EOS on its node, based on the current price of EOS.

The firm said Wednesday that the investments have been made mainly via its subsidiary Dunamu & Partners, which was launched in March 2018. At the time of the launch, the firm announced a three-year plan to invest 100 billion won ($84 million) in the blockchain industry.  The investments have been into companies that are focused on developing core blockchain solutions, as well as those related to fintech and games, Dunamu said, which also operates the Kakao Stock trading app.  Portfolio companies now include stablecoin-based payments network Terra, fintech startup Rainist and gaming software firm Dalcom Soft, according to the announcement. Peer-to-peer lending platform Honest Fund, online travel agency Tide Square and blockchain-based investment platform Finhaven have also seen investments from Dunamu.  Ryan Lee, CEO of Dunamu and Partners, indicated that the firm will continue to invest in blockchain and fintech startups this year, regardless of their size, stage and region.  “Our goal is to contribute to the healthy growth of the blockchain ecosystem by actively investing in startups with world class technology and services with potential for real-life implementation,” said Lee.  In particular, the firm will focus on companies that will help drive mainstream adoption of blockchain-based services and mobile fintech services, as well as those centered around individual content creators, according to the announcement.  Indeed, earlier this year, Dunamu backed a $3 million seed round for blockchain startup Band Protocol, which incentivizes reliable content producers with token rewards and staking.  The firm added Wednesday that it also partnered with games developer Neptune in April 2018 to set up a 100 billion won ($84 million) fund to invest in blockchain-based gaming companies.

Following the upgrade, Binance published an update saying that trading will recommence at 13:00 UTC.

Following the breach, CZ said in a blog post that the exchange would make “significant” changes related to its application programming interface (API), two-factor authentication (2FA) and withdrawal validation to reduce the risk of future hacks.  The exchange did not disclose full details regarding these efforts due to security concerns, but did say it's also improving risk management and know-your-customer procedures to fight phishing, among other measures at the back-end.

42430483,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMvGph,1557923428,Free Markets and the Future of Blockchain,"J. Christopher Giancarlo is Chairman at U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the agency of the US government that regulates futures and options markets.      This will be the last time I speak to you from the CFTC.  Nevertheless, before I go, I wanted to share some thoughts, which I have been saving. My five years at the Commission have been an immense privilege. In the time that I have served, I have learned a lot about the issues facing America’s farmers, ranchers, producers, energy firms and other users of commodity futures who depend on the CFTC-regulated markets for their risk management needs.  It has also been my honor to work on so many issues close to the hearts and minds of the crypto community, not least of which are: virtual currencies, distributed ledger technology (DLT) and fintech broadly. I am appreciative for the time I had to serve as chairman and especially humbled by the moniker of “Crypto Dad” that I was given by this fantastic community of vibrant, bright, ambitious people.  I look back on my time at the Commission since first being sworn in back in 2014, and I marvel at the swift pace of change in issues facing the agency. When I first joined as a Commissioner, the CFTC was just coming off five intense years of feverishly writing Dodd-Frank rules to reform Wall Street in the wake of the biggest financial crisis in America in more than 70 years.  I could not have predicted at the time that virtual currencies, DLT and fintech would become such a major part of the conversation for our agency. I feel fortunate to have been at the helm during this time to be a voice in government to quiet some of the fears and calls to dismiss or squash this new technology.  I recently identified several factors that are challenging the work of regulators: the extraordinary pace of exponential technological change, the disintermediation of traditional actors and business models, and the need for technological literacy and big data capability.  I said that the CFTC’s response to rapidly changing markets and technological developments, including blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies, is built upon the following four cornerstones:  Adopting an ""exponential growth mindset"" that anticipates the rapid pace of technological innovation and the need for an appropriate regulatory response  Becoming a ""quantitative regulator"" able to conduct independent market data analysis across different data sources, including decentralized blockchains and networks, without being reliant on self-regulatory organizations and market intermediaries  Embracing ""market-based solutions"" to determine the value of technological innovations, as we witnessed with the launch of crypto-asset-based futures products  Establishing an internal fintech Stakeholder to address the opportunities and challenges that fintech presents and manage the ever-present tension between innovation and regulation.  Pace of change  With this audience, I never needed to make the argument that the 21st-century digital transformation is well underway – you already knew that, because you are the leaders of this change.  Therefore, it comes as no surprise to this audience that, just as our lives are being transformed, so the world’s trading markets are going through the same digital revolution from analog to digital, from human to algorithmic trading and from stand-alone centers to interconnected trading webs. Emerging digital technologies are impacting trading markets and the entire financial landscape with far-ranging implications for capital formation and risk transfer.  It has been a core belief during my tenure as Chairman that in order for the CFTC to remain an effective regulator, it must keep pace with these changes, or our regulations will become outdated and ineffective. I am pleased to say that over the last two years, the CFTC has been no bystander to the digitization of modern markets.  Many of you have already met with LabCFTC, the initiative we launched to put our agency at the forefront of the digital transformation so that we could be more accessible to market innovators, as well as more proactive in our understanding new technologies. Since it was launched two years ago, LabCFTC has had over 250 separate interactions with innovators big and small. It conducts “lab hours” in places where innovators work: from Silicon Valley, California to Silicon Hills, Texas and from the South Bank of London to Singapore Center.  LabCFTC is not a “sandbox.” It does not try to pick winners from losers. Instead, LabCFTC provides us both an internal and external technological focus. Internally, it means explaining technology innovation to agency staff and other regulators and advocating for technology adoption. Externally, that means reaching out and learning about technological change and market evolution, while providing a dedicated liaison to innovators.  I am proud to say that LabCFTC has become a category leader. Every U.S. federal financial regulator has either created or is creating a program similar to it.  In a few more weeks the world will mark the 500th anniversary of the death of Leonardo Da Vinci.  One of the powerful lasting figures of the Renaissance his cross-disciplinary genius gave us art, architecture and invention. Da Vinci was uniquely gifted and positioned in history to be present at a time when people’s thinking around life moved from something that had to be short and brutish toward something that could be enjoyable.  The Renaissance was a time of education and study when people attempted to improve the world through the power of ideas. I do not think I am being too bold when I say that we are in such a time again. A boldness to innovate is at the center of the technology revolutions of big data, DLT and AI.  The combination of these technologies and others still yet unimagined will standardize and distribute data to market participants and regulators while bringing tremendous efficiencies. These technologies will also bring amazing advances to other areas of our world as well, such as international trade, charitable endeavors, health care, social services and more.  Protecting Free Markets  I believe we are at a tipping point, where innovation will help us rise to meet our greatest challenges.  As we consider potential solutions to these great challenges, I think it’s important to view them through the prism of an enduring ideal, which is the value proposition of free market capitalism.  The proposition is that broad and sustained prosperity generally occurs wherever in the world there are open and competitive markets, free of political interference, combined with free enterprise, personal choice, voluntary exchange and legal protection of person and property. Free markets and innovation are natural partners in this respect.  Under free market capitalism, well-regulated and well-ordered trading activity is considered a forum of human self-expression and economic advancement. Freedom to act in the marketplace is a part of freedom itself. Billions of consumers, following their own self-interests and individual needs, make the decisions that direct the future, not have it directed for them.  For an emerging generation fascinated by crowdsourcing, free capital markets are the ultimate in crowd-sourced decision making. Free market capitalism is not a source of misery and oppression; free market capitalism is the antidote. It is unmatched in alleviating global poverty and unlocking human potential.  We must disabuse ourselves, our peers, and future generations of the notion that there is anything attractive or aspirational about political control of markets and human enterprise. Everywhere it has been tried, it has been a fraud and a failure. It crushes human liberty and society. It steals power from individuals and families and gives it to government and government elites. It enables abuse by a select few who exercise unbridled power over many.  For innovators, controlled economies are dream destroyers. Free markets should be the natural choice of today’s innovators, who today are striving to build bright and better futures.  I personally hope that we can renew faith in free markets for ourselves and our children. We must not be intimidated, but be confident. With the proper balance of sound policy, regulatory oversight, private sector innovation and a little bit of courage, new technologies and global trading methodologies will lead our markets to evolve in responsible ways, and continue to grow the economy and create a future of untethered aspiration, a future where creativity and economic expression is a social good in its own right, a source of human growth and advancement.

42430491,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMvH3h,1557921613,Congressman Emmer to Reintroduce Tax Bill Focused on Crypto Hard Forks,"U.S. Representative Tom Emmer plans to reintroduce a bill that would benefit taxpayers who hold cryptocurrency resulting from blockchain network splits, or hard forks.  Emmer revealed his intention to reintroduce the “Safe Harbor for Taxpayers with Forked Assets” bill, first announced in 2018, during a panel on the relationship between government and technologies at Consensus 2019 on Monday.  The Minnesota congressman was joined on stage by Chamber of Digital Commerce president and founder Perianne Boring, Fidelity Investments deputy general counsel David Forman, and CoinDesk advisory board chairman Michael Casey.  For his part, Emmer reaffirmed his commitment to supporting the development and use of blockchain tech and cryptocurrencies, and bemoaned the complex network of regulators that the industry must navigate, pointing to the CFTC, the SEC, and others who “all have bits and pieces” of the regulatory picture, but have failed to provide regulatory certainty.  He indicated that Congress’ job is “getting government in line” such that the blockchain industry can generate new opportunities and innovations.  In practice, the certainty that Emmer and his Blockchain Caucus, co-chaired by Representatives David Schweikert and Darren Soto, have sought to provide has come in the form of measures like proposing that crypto miners should not be classified as money transmitters.  CoinDesk has further learned that the Safe Harbor for Taxpayers with Forked Assets bill would prevent the IRS from penalizing unreported crypto assets gained through hard forks until the IRS issues clear guidance on their regulatory treatment. The bill may also include airswaps, which were not covered in the bill’s earlier iteration.  However, Emmer noted that Congress still has some work to do before it could effectively advocate for the blockchain industry.  “You have members who have quite frankly a range of understanding and backgrounds, and there isn’t a lot of range when it comes to blockchain technology,” he said. “A lot of them have these preconceived notions, all they’ve ever heard of is the Silk Road.”  During the panel, Boring contended that the U.S. government lags behind other areas of the world in its exploration of blockchain. The EU, for example, has already invested 80 million euros in blockchain initiatives, she said, adding that they plan to invest 340 million euros by 2020.  Boring also pointed to China as being at the cutting edge of blockchain development, citing a state media report which called blockchain “10 times more important” than the internet.

42430503,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMvHRh,1557918760,"Bitcoin Price Rally Stalls As Ether, XRP Shine","View  Alternative cryptocurrencies are flying high while bitcoin is having a breather above $8,000.  Notably, ether (ETH) has hit a seven-month high of $235 and looks set to extend gains further toward $256 (Sept. 22 high) in the near-term. XRP, meanwhile, has confirmed a bull breakout.  With hourly chart indicators diverging in favor of the bears and the daily relative strength index (RSI) reporting overbought conditions, bitcoin is looking increasingly vulnerable to a price pullback to the key rising trendline, currently placed above $7,200.  Bitcoin could challenge Tuesday's high of $8,335 and possibly break toward $8,500 if the lower highs pattern seen on the RSI is invalidated.  With bitcoin (BTC) price rally showing signs of exhaustion above $8,000, investors have begun diverting money into relatively cheap alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins).  The world's leading cryptocurrency by market value jumped to a 10-month high of $8,335 in the early European trading hours on Tuesday. The rally, however, stalled with BTC witnessing a minor pullback to lows near $7,600 in the U.S. trading hours.  As of writing, BTC has returned to levels just below $8,000, representing little change on the day.  While bitcoin is showing signs of bullish exhaustion, the altcoin market is a sea of green with prominent coins like ether – the second largest cryptocurrency by market value – rising to $235 on Bitstamp, its highest level since Oct. 1, 2018.  At time of writing, ether is trading at $232 – up 12 percent on the day – having witnessed a golden crossover, a bullish cross of the 50-day and 200-day moving averages (MAs) last month.  Even ether's strong performance, however, is being overshadowed by XRP, which is the best performing top cryptocurrency of the last 24 hours.  The price of a single XRP jumped to $0.45 earlier today, the highest level since Dec. 24, confirming a double bottom breakout (a bearish-to-bullish trend change) on the three-day chart. As a result, the third largest cryptocurrency could rise further toward $0.50 in the near-term.  While major altcoins have found some love, the flow of money is also heading towards lesser-known cryptocurrencies, as seen in the chart below.  The surge in altcoins has pushed their total market capitalization to $95.65 billion – a level last seen on Nov. 8, 2018.  BTC 4-hour and hourly charts  The lower highs on both the relative strength index (RSI) and the Chaikin money flow (CMF) on the 4-hour chart (above left) indicate that bullish momentum for BTC has weakened. The cryptocurrency could see a price pullback, possibly to the ascending trendline support, currently at $7,300.  The case for a deeper correction would strengthen if the 50-hour moving average (MA) support is breached. That average, currently at $7,872, has reversed pullbacks twice in the last 24 hours.  The case for a rally to $8,500 and higher would strengthen if the hourly chart RSI (above right) violates the falling trendline, representing bearish divergence. The bulls, however, may have a tough time holding onto gains above $8,500 (July 2018 high), as the daily RSI reporting extreme overbought conditions.  Ether 3-day chart  Ether's rise to seven-month highs validates the ascending triangle breakout (bearish-to-bullish trend change) signaled witnessed in the three-days to May 12 (previous 3-day candle).  The cryptocurrency has violated the 16-month-long falling trendline, while the 5- and 10-candle moving averages (MAs) are trending north, indicating a bullish setup.  Prices, therefore, could challenge the immediate resistance at $256 in the near-term. The bullish outlook would be invalidated only if prices fall back below the high of $187 registered in the three days to April 10.

42402927,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAddfgp,1557915617,"SEC Slaps Blockchain Author Alex Tapscott, Firm With Fines Over Securities Violations","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has fined blockchain author Alex Tapscott and his investment firm NextBlock Global over securities violations.  The SEC says that Canada-based NextBlock had been offering securities that were not registered with the SEC ""in any capacity"" and that false misrepresentations were made about the firm when soliciting investors. The agency has therefore ordered Tapscott, co-author of the book “Blockchain Revolution,” to pay a $25,000 penalty and also issued a cease-and-desist on further securities violations by him or his firm.  The SEC said it had taken into account the remedial acts ""promptly undertaken"" by Tapscott and NextBlock when agreeing the terms of the settlement. It also said that, following the firm's payment of a 700,000 Canadian dollar (roughly US$520,000) administrative penalty, it had not imposed a further civil penalty on the company.  NextBlock was launched in 2017, raising $20 million via convertible debentures – a type of debt instrument – at the time to invest in blockchain and cryptocurrency companies, the commission said.  The SEC further said that, in order to solicit funds from investors in the U.S., Canada and elsewhere, NextBlock and Tapscott falsely claimed that as many as four “prominent” individuals in the blockchain industry were serving as advisors to the firm.  NextBlock and Tapscott also initiated a second funding round and hired two Canadian investment banks as advisors for the effort, as well as to help list the firm on the Toronto Stock Exchange, according to the order. However, due to media reports of misrepresentations to investors, NextBlock canceled the round and its initial public offering plan.  Later, NextBlock voluntarily initiated court proceedings in Ontario to wind up operations and liquidate its existing digital asset holdings, and return the funds to debenture holders with principal investment plus profits (approximately 140 percent as of March 2019).  Tapscott has voluntarily surrendered his right to collect his share from NextBlock’s profits worth over $2 million, an amount that was retained by the firm and formed part of the distributions to debenture holders, the order states.

42402922,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAddfct,1557914423,"Bitcoin in Space? It Helps Connection Woes, Says Blockstream's Adam Back","Adam Back, CEO of bitcoin technology startup Blockstream, dove into the lesser-known uses for beaming bitcoin from space during a presentation at Consensus 2019 on Tuesday.  The startup launched its cryptocurrency-focused satellite product nearly two years ago with the primary goal of giving people who don't have an internet connection another way to download a bitcoin full node, the most secure form of connecting to and using the network.  But while that's the reasoning they give out for the most part, Back went into some other use cases where a satellite connection can have value, first pointing to ""political disruption,"" when people are stuck in the middle of political mayhem that's out of their control.  Back said:  ""One of the first things that happens in a coup, like in Arab Springs, is that [those in power] disconnect the internet.""  In this scenario, satellites offer an alternative way to connect to the bitcoin network. Along those lines, mostly when talking about technology satellites, advocates emphasize that the technology has the ability to onboard people who are less fortunate, maybe living in a part of the world that doesn't have easy access to the internet.  But Back actually made the case that it can provide user cases for people in luckier situations, too.  First, and perhaps most practically, Back argues that this is actually, in some ways, cheaper than a normal internet connection. You can save on the bandwidth costs of a normal internet connection by outsourcing a satellite to download bitcoin updates for you.  Then there's the privacy angle. If you aren't careful, anyone can glimpse online to see the IP address associated with your node. But with a satellite connection, it's much harder to see who's connecting to it to grab the full node data.  ""It gives you a great deal of privacy. By using satellite to receive a full node, no one knows you’re participating in the bitcoin network,"" Back said.  Finally, downloading a bitcoin full node by satellite also offer an alternative in the case of outages, which exchanges and merchants are all privy to as they need to run some form of node to connect to the network This bad for miners, who can lose money, as they won't be able to mine so-called ""block rewards"" – each of which is worth $87,000 at current market prices – for however long they lose their internet connection.  ""I’ve heard firsthand stories from mining farm operators that they’ve been forced to run a farm on a cell phone signal for a week,"" Back said, arguing that a satellite is a much cheaper form of backup.

42410989,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ghle0q,1557910855,The Blockchain Paradox,"Pindar Wong is the chairman of VeriFi (Hong Kong) Ltd and a member of CoinDesk’s advisory board. An internet pioneer, he co­founded the first licensed Internet Service Provider in Hong Kong in 1993.  The following article originally appeared in Consensus Magazine, distributed exclusively to attendees of CoinDesk’s Consensus 2019 event.     From ethereum’s conflicted handling of The DAO attack to bitcoin’s block size ""civil war,"" to the new staking, baking and voting models for upgrading protocols and electing delegates in more recent blockchain projects, “governance” has long been a heated topic in blockchain communities  As pressure for capacity upgrades has grown along with blockchain adoption, communities have struggled to find an idealized “decentralized governance” model for agreeing on code changes and software forks. The difficulty is understandable. After all, the very idea of blockchain governance can seem like a paradox wrapped in a dilemma. The paradox: “How do you change something which is ‘immutable’?”  The dilemma: “In choosing between a hard fork or soft fork: do you split the very value of using a blockchain in the first place?""  I used to characterize the distinct approaches to these fundamental questions as either “on-chain” governance, where code change negotiations are baked into the protocol’s consensus mechanisms (Decred, DFINITY, EOS, Tezos), or “off-chain” governance (bitcoin, ethereum), where upgrade proposals are negotiated offline before being implemented. (Within the latter  camp I also saw further division, as some, particularly in the bitcoin community, forswear any form of off-chain governance at all.)  I say “used to” because I no longer think it’s productive to address this puzzle in purely ‘decentralized’ or ‘governance’ terms. Learning from the confusion and heartache of the past 20 years in which governments – the traditional, offline kind – have struggled to understand who “governs the Internet,” I think we need to change the taxonomy.  I suggest substituting “polycentric” for “decentralized,” and “stewardship” for “governance.”  Decentralized governance: ‘Polycentric stewardship’  While authorities took years to understand what ""Internet Governance"" meant, billions of hosts and multiple “stakeholders” continued to come online worldwide. This meant that, much like blockchain technology, the Internet had its own “scaling issues.” We didn’t run out of block weight or block gas limit, but we did run out of numbers to name each network interface  (IPv4 address exhaustion).  In addressing these challenges, a complex ecosystem of stewardship emerged, almost organically. The Internet’s governance came to comprise many independent but interrelated groups, each managing the development of distinctly different but equally important protocols.  The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) stewarded the core internet protocols that connect hosts on the network (TCP/IP, BGP, HTTPS); the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) stewarded the standards for the Web (HTML); and the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) stewarded the Domain Name System (DNS), to name but a few groups.  Today, the Internet is not a single complex legal protocol agreed to by 195 nation states, but a mix of technical protocols that are voluntarily adopted by over 70,000 Autonomous Systems(AS): each of which independently operates its own network.  This complexity in the stewardship ecosystem evolved as the demand for online commercial services generated it’s many scaling challenges. But while it meant there would be no single centralized body responsible for all the policies and protocols that Internet users’ rely upon, it did leave a concentration of authority within each group. Each organically evolved its own  distinct culture and community norms, its form, to follow its unique function and pursue a common goal of stewarding the development of specific protocols and policy standards.  Together, these groups now comprise a “polycentralized” ecosystem, having many centers. I see blockchain protocol development following a similar trajectory, with complexity growing as networks become more layered (e.g. the Lightning Network), as different consensus algorithms develop, and as different kinds of specific blockchain hardware such as hardware wallets are deployed. While it’s true that the overall blockchain ecosystem is “not centralized” – that it lacks an overarching center of power or control – I would argue that it is already polycentralized.  As such, it’s not helpful to fixate on a “decentralized” ideal.  Immutability and immunity  How then can we also frame and simplify reasoning about the different roles, and complex interests, within a single family of blockchain protocols? For example, between bitcoin’s multiple stakeholders: developers, exchange operators, full-node operators, miners and end-users.  One lesson I learned from helping organise the 2015 “Scaling Bitcoin” workshops was that thoughtful protocol designers gave careful attention to the overall sustainability of an immutable blockchain. They sought to address not only classic computational “space and time” tradeoffs, such as how to process an “optimally malicious block,” but also more specific concerns with how transaction costs are externalised to the network -- for example, how to manage the unspent transaction output (UTXO) set.  In 2016, I shared my learning at the MIT Bitcoin Expo, but at that time I still felt that the rough and tumble of divisive debate and stressful challenges to the network would only make the bitcoin protocol and community more robust and immune to future challenges. Drawing parallels with the evolution of biological systems and the herd immunity they develop in response to persistent threats, I concluded that bitcoin’s “antifragile” framework was working.  Unfortunately, I didn’t then have a more thorough way of reasoning what a “healthy” – i.e. sustainable – network should look like. There was no mathematical theory for measuring an ecosystem’s sustainability. So, I wasn’t seeing the overall picture and missing some of the ecosystem’s more fundamental governance challenges.  I now believe that the foundational work of Nobel economist Elinor Ostrom and euro architect Bernard Lietaer, both recently deceased, may point the way forward, to better frame discussions so that we can ask the right questions at the right time, measure what should be measured and respond accordingly.  Blockchain: A common-pool resource  Ostrom, who passed away in 2012, studied what economists call ‘common-pool resources’ (CPR), such as pastures for grazing or water for irrigation, all of which risk contention and overexploitation if overused. I think it is helpful to consider blockchain transaction capacity, the blockchain itself, and other related resources such as computation power in the same vein, as CPRs.  Before Ostrom’s research, it was thought that the only way to sustainably steward such resources was either by establishing private property rights or with government regulation. After studying hundred of cases of sustainable CPRs worldwide, Ostrom found that complex systems aren’t necessarily “chaotic” by default. She found sustainable CPRs – in Maine lobster fishermen’s common governance of their fishery, for example -- and discovered a third way was possible. She identified eight helpful common ‘design principles’ for managing sustainable CPRs, together with two frameworks for reasoning: the Institutional Analysis and Design (IAD) and the Social-Ecological Systems (SES) Frameworks.  I find Ostrom’s frameworks fruitful for thinking about the tradeoffs between different blockchain CPRs: collective bandwidth, memory, disk and computational capacity, etc. Though the mapping is not exact, or one-to-one, I believe it can help future researchers develop common design principles in blockchain incentive design.  Ostrom’s IAD and SES frameworks are not enough alone. They might help us ask the right questions and compare the sustainability of different blockchain ecosystems, but how does one actually measure it for a blockchain network? Here the late Bernard Lietaer has much to offer.  Blockchain: A complex adaptive flow network  Lietaer, who died earlier this year, co-designed and implemented the European currency system’s convergence mechanism, making him, in many respects, a key architect of the euro.  He was a monetary scholar and wrote four books on the future of money. He also did pioneering work in the pre-cryptocurrency field of “complementary currencies” and in 2017 was named Chief Monetary Architect of the Bancor Protocol Foundation, which oversees the ethereum- based Bancor liquidity network for token convertibility.  Lietaer’s definition of money as “an agreement within a community to use something standardized as a medium of exchange"" is among my favorites. Most importantly, he and Robert E. Ulanowicz developed a single metric for measuring the sustainability of “complex adaptive flow networks,” such as those that exist in flows of nutrients in nature or financial flows in economic networks.  The practical takeaway from a lifetime of studying real-life ecosystems is that there appears to be only a small “window of viability” between optimizing a sustainable network for greater resiliency and greater throughput. In the case of a “monoculture in money,” the implication is that a small handful of different kinds of money are needed for optimal sustainability.  This bodes well for the wider adoption of cryptocurrencies.  A new rulebook  Like a sixth sense, I see ‘dead’ governance models everywhere, all laid waste by the collision of two worlds: the world of borderless networks, as embodied in the Internet, and the world of bordered nations. From Facebook’s crisis, which prompted its CEO to cry that “The Internet Needs New Rules,” to the UK’s Brexit crisis, it’s clear that a new stewardship rulebook is required.  With their capacity to automatically enforce rules across a borderless network, blockchain protocols offer potential solutions to these deep-seated problems. But if their own governance challenges prevent them from scaling beyond their current capacity limits, that opportunity will be lost.  When addressing such challenges, we need to design blockchain ecosystems as sustainable common-pool resources. It’s this third-way approach to negotiating complex competing interests – neither chaos nor centralized control – that will allow blockchains to sustainably scale into becoming a vital element of humanity’s economic future.  Our future is decentralized not disorganized, our future is polycentric.

42402928,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAddffq,1557906642,Hacked Cryptocurrency Exchange Cryptopia Goes Into Liquidation,"Cryptopia, the cryptocurrency exchange hit by a major hack in mid-January, has gone into liquidation and suspended trading operations.  The news was announced Wednesday by Cryptopia’s assigned liquidator, professional services firm Grant Thornton New Zealand. Cryptopia confirmed the news on Twitter, as well as on its website.  Possibly signaling changes afoot, Cryptopia website went under maintenance yesterday without any message to the public on its social media platforms. It was first noticed by a Redditor who asked whether the exchange had been hacked again.  Back in January, Cryptopia went offline for a couple of days before stating mid-month that it had “suffered a security breach which resulted in significant losses.” A blockchain data analytics firm estimated after the attack that as much as $16 million in ether and ERC-20 tokens could have lost. Later, in March, the exchange restarted trading services, but still had banking issues.  Grant Thornton said the hack had a “severe” impact on the company’s trade, and despite the management’s efforts to reduce cost and return the business to profitability, it was decided that liquidation was the best path forward for all stakeholders.  David Ruscoe and Russell Moore from Grant Thornton will help Cryptopia secure its assets “for the benefit of all stakeholders,” according to today's announcement.  “While this process and investigations take place, trading on the exchange is suspended,” Grant Thornton said, adding that the complex investigation will take “months rather than weeks.”  Commenting on Cryptopia's Twitter announcement, numerous customers have expressed frustration that they were not allowed to withdraw funds since the hack, with some also calling for creditors to organize and take legal action against the exchange.  Ruscoe said:  “We realise Cryptopia’s customers will want to have this matter resolved as soon as possible. We will conduct a thorough investigation, working with several different stakeholders including management and shareholders, to find the solution that is in the best interests of customers and stakeholders.”  Grant Thornton is expected to file an initial report on the case next week on the New Zealand Companies Office website.
