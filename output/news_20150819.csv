42398609,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbcJ5q,1440005199,Bitcoin Up For Discussion at Commonwealth Virtual Currency Meeting,"The Commonwealth Virtual Currencies Working Group will meet for the first time next week to discuss the management of cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin.  The specialist group, formed by the Commonwealth – a voluntary association of 53 independent countries, almost all of which were formerly under British rule – is made up of members from the Commonwealth Secretariat, Australia, Barbados, Kenya, Nigeria, Singapore, Tonga and the UK.  Along with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, intergovernmental organisation Interpol and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), members at the event held in London will explore the risks associated with virtual currencies, the existing legal frameworks, regulatory responses and potential benefits of use in developing countries.  A spokesperson for the Commonwealth Secretariat commented on the purpose of the meeting, telling CoinDesk:    ""Recognising both the associated benefits and risks, the group will meet to design technical guidance for member states on potential regulatory and legislative measures to effectively respond to virtual currencies.""              She continued: ""The meeting will also be an opportunity to hear from a range of experts about the latest developments in the sector. Participants will also share findings from a recent Commonwealth survey which shows innovative use for legitimate business opportunities but also warns an absence of regulations is exacerbating criminal exploitation.""    The event  , will feature Alden Pelker of the FBI's Money Laundering Intelligence Unit and Joe Mignano of the US Department of Justice, among others. It is taking place on 24th and 25th August.  Alden Pelker is also speaking at CoinDesk's inaugural event, Consensus 2015, in New York on 10th September.

42398613,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbcJ8n,1439988428,Bitcoin Price Falls 14% Following Bitfinex 'Flash Crash',"UPDATE (20th August 17:56 BST): Comment added from Zane Tackett, BitFinex's director of community and product development.      Bitcoin's price fell 14% in a period of just 30 minutes following a 'flash crash' on exchange Bitfinex yesterday night.  The CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index had been holding steady between $250 and $255, but dropped to a low of $214.36 just before midnight (UTC). In the same period, the Bitfinex price sunk 29% to $179.35.  Bitfinex, which claims to be the most liquidhttps://www.bitfinex.com/pages/features exchange in the world, told CoinDesk the 'flash crash' was triggered when several leveraged positions were forcibly closed in close proximity to each other, adding:  ""The surprisingly small amount of liquidity on the book below $225 made it possible for the market to spike lower before recovering to prevailing prices on other exchanges.""  Alongside a regular buy/sell orderbook, Bitfinex offers margin trading, meaning users can borrow funds from the platform's lenders – known as 'peer liquidity providers' – at a rate of interest to trade bitcoin. These users place 'long' or 'short' bets on whether bitcoin's price will rise or fall.  When the price shifts suddenly, as it did yesterday, 'long' users who have borrowed funds may see their account equity drop to zero – at which point Bitfinex will automatically liquidate their positions.  This can exacerbate price movement, as these positions add to sell-side pressure on an already crashing market.  Circuit breakers  There are ways to mitigate against such drastic movements – some traditional exchanges put a 10% limit on price movements from the previous day's close for example.  Zane Tackett, BitFinex's director of community and product development, told CoinDesk the exchange does have such 'circuit breakers' in place for orders that will move the market beyond a certain percentage, however they were not triggered as it wasn't any singular order that caused the 'flash crash'.  He said:  ""We are still examining the conditions surrounding the price action to ferret out any deliberate price manipulation, but so far we see nothing more than supply exceeding demand and, of course, areas for improvement in our price stability mechanisms.""  In an interview with members of the 'Whale Club', Bitfinex's Phil Potter indicated the platform had experienced a number of technical difficulties, including a lag in its live engine that updates positions.  Margin trading  While a familiar part of most markets, margin trading is a relatively recent phenomenon in bitcoin, with two exchanges adding it in the last two months alone.  Timo Schlaefer, CEO of derivatives trading platform Crypto Facilities, told CoinDesk margin trading on spot exchanges destabilises the price and has lead to ""numerous"" flash crashes over the years. Last August, instances on Bitfinex and BTC-e were blamed for a 10% price decline.  ""You need to make a decision if you want to be a robust spot exchange (ie no margin trading) or something else, but you cannot be both,"" he said, adding:  ""This is bad for bitcoin as it shows that the market is still immature and unreliable and there seems to have been little progress in that regard over the last year or so.""  However, not everyone agrees. A bitcoin market maker who wished to remain anonymous said flash crashes are not unique to markets with margin trading.  ""You can do margin trading without it actually being offered by the platform itself, nothing prevents you going and borrowing money to fuel a gambling habit.""  He claimed the ""gambling mentality"" in the bitcoin space, with traders happy to put a lot of money on the line with lot of leverage, exacerbated price moves. Meanwhile, the current uncertainty and ""public bickering"" over the Bitcoin XT fork is bound to affect the price negatively, he added.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Grace Caffyn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/08/19/bitcoin-price-falls-14-following-bitfinex-flash-crash,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6d8d8f5e8efac4b6b50815fd1c3b7800eb6e84d8-1496x689.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42398605,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbcJ0v,1439981563,Spanish Authorities Clarify How Tax Applies to Bitcoin Losses,"The Spanish tax authorities have clarified how the country's existing tax laws should be applied to losses incurred by the collapse of a bitcoin exchange, the result of a scam or a situation of insolvency.  Spain's Dirección General de Tributos (DGT) received a question from a bitcoin enthusiast who claimed to have lost a large part of their savings after investing in bitcoin.  According to the question  , the person deposited their bitcoin in a third party loan service in 2013. At the end of the year, the website's administrator – identified only by nickname and a public key – announced the bitcoin had been stolen and, as such, customer deposits could not be returned.  The bitcoin enthusiast was then offered a refund amounting to 5% of their deposited bitcoin, in exchange for dropping claims for a full refund and not proceeding with legal action.  Suspicious that the website had been running a pyramid scheme, the bitcoin aficionado refused the offer and presented his case to the Spanish police and the relevant authorities of the country where the website is thought to have been registered. These, however, were unable to help because the claimant was Spanish and fell under Spanish jurisdiction.  Clarification  In response to the question, the DGT noted these kind of situations were covered by the existing Personal Income Tax Law and that, in order for the losses to be considered a capital loss for tax purposes, one of the following conditions must apply:  The reduction of the debt has been approved by a judge.  The debtor is in bankruptcy and there is a reduction of the debt during the procedure; or the credit is not recovered after the bankruptcy procedure.  The non-recovered credit is still outstanding a year after formal proceedings have began.  Alejandro Gomez de la Cruz, lawyer and founder of Law and Bitcoin, told CoinDesk:  ""I think the current law has been interpreted correctly. Whether it is positive or not, I think that these kind of interpretations will be welcomed by the community.""  When asked about the wider implications of the DGT's clarifications, the lawyer said it could help bitcoin companies see the Spanish state was bitcoin friendly, by clarifying doubts and guaranteeing a certain amount of judicial security.  More from Spain    This is not the first time the Spanish authorities have spoken out about bitcoin.    Earlier this year, the country's bitcoin community celebrated confirmation by Spain's Ministerio de Hacienda that the digital currency was exempt from Value Added Tax.  Hat tip: Law and Bitcoin.

42398615,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbcJAl,1439974723,The 8 Steps to Becoming a Bitcoin-Savvy Bank,"William Mougayar is a Toronto-based angel investor and four-time entrepreneur who advises startups on strategy and marketing. In the first of this three-part series, he discussed how banks dealt with the emergence of the Internet and how blockchain technology is causing these institutions a whole new headache. In part two, Mougayar looked at why banks should start embracing blockchain technology. Here, in part three, he explores the steps banks should take to make sure they lead the blockchain-banking revolution.  What should banks do?    Don’t just do pilots that automate old processes. Rather, launch major reengineering efforts across all processes and ask the important question: What could Crypto-Tech enable now if we reinvented it?      Here is a list of potential actions:      1. Hire or promote a leader      Hire or promote a real leader from within, and give them the title of “Blockchain Czar”. That person should have experience in banking operations and know about reengineering business processes via technology implementations. Tough to find that person? Find them. Let them be your spokesperson in the marketplace, not an analyst in your research department or someone in charge of innovation.      That person will be responsible for removing obstacles within your organization, education, best practices, and project managing the various implementations. This job is a tough one, but it involves finding and obliterating old processes, instead of blindly automating what you are currently doing.      2. Mine cryptocurrency      How about getting your feet wet with some mining action? Buy a few extra computers and mine bitcoin or other currencies so you can learn what it’s like be in the cryptocurrency waters. Here’s why Banks and Brokerages Should be Mining the Blockchain.      3. Train staff      Send the top 10% of your IT staff to courses on cryptocurrency platforms, tools and technology. Let them learn the bitcoin blockchain and its various overlay technologies, Ethereum’s contract languages, and many other ready-to-use crypto technologies.      4. Don't invest      Don’t invest in blockchain startups. Become one (if you can). Investing is not a spectator’s sport. You need to get involved, and not just watch. If an investment allows you to participate in the actual outcome of the technology solution, that’s one thing. But if your investment is so-called for learning purposes, you’re wasting that money.      Invest in direct learning and by doing stuff, and not by watching others. Operating like a technology startup is very different from operating inside a bank. Yes it is about culture, and a bank doesn’t have a startup culture, nor does the word innovation mean the same thing to a nimble startup that is hungry and ambitious, as compared to what it means to an overhead-laden bank.      5. Buy a bitcoin exchange      Immediately. The good thing about the proliferation of bitcoin exchanges around the world, (and there are at least 50 viable ones) is that there is one for each large bank out there. The merging of bitcoin trading inside banks is inevitable. Most of these exchanges have already developed the basic technology, but the biggest pain has been how new users fund and connect their wallets with their banking accounts.      If you merge online banking with bitcoin trading, you automatically eliminate the friction that currently exists for onboarding new users. OK, you’re afraid, I can tell. So, why not limit bitcoin conversions to $1,000 or something like that. Bitcoin to fiat conversions should be real-time.      You know how to handle customer relationships. The bitcoin exchanges have technical capabilities, but their CRM and customer support are not great. One of the big banks will blink first and buy one of the fledgling bitcoin exchanges and delight their existing customers. Why not you?      6. Re-invent trading and capital markets      Remove the delays and intermediaries. Delays means more costs. Real-time levels off inefficiencies. Remove the steps that are not need during the settlement and clearing stages.      7. Offer remittance services      Offer free (or really cheap) cross-border remittances services. Abolish wire transfer fees. That’s a tough one, and I’m sure you’re not going to do it. But if you used the bitcoin network instead of SWIFT, I can guarantee your transfer costs will decrease by orders of magnitude.      8. Create a cryptocurrency task force      You like task forces and committees. Create an internal cryptocurrency task force with members from each functional group, and let them have weekly meetings to share initiatives, projects, and learnings. Even better, get them all on a Slack group and invite anyone in the bank to participate in it.    A strategic roadmap    Most banking executives probably don’t even have a bitcoin account, nor have used a bitcoin wallet; yet they are in charge of their organization’s future when the future is staring them in the face with the word “blockchain” in it. This isn’t unlike the early Internet and email days, when corporate executives were laggard users and had their secretary print their email for them.      It is so important to get a first hand feel with a bitcoin account in order to experience the flexibility, speed and innovations that are built-in. For example, you can send money to anyone in the world by just knowing their email address or bitcoin address, without a banking relationship, and without going anywhere physical. That’s pretty awesome in itself. You can convert from fiat to bitcoin and vice-versa, including wiring money to a fiat account for free.      It is absolute freedom in terms of money movements, and it happens almost instantly and at the peer-to-peer level. Granted you can’t pay bills, and can’t easily use bitcoin at the cash register, but these aren’t show stoppers for now.      When every asset has a blockchain linkage, it puts it at par with bits that travel at Internet speeds. And that comes with a built-in trust layer that transports the transaction’s history and validation with itself. That’s a powerful capability (also called smart property), and it will free financial assets and instruments from the latency and inertia of legacy clearing and settlement processes and usher in efficiencies, speeds and innovations.      At the end of the day, it’s about financial services, not the blockchain. The blockchain is just an enabler.      If you can disrupt your business successfully, then you can also disrupt your competitors, but if you just focus on protecting your business, you’re really living in the status quo. Internal disruption is always more benign than an external one, especially if it is done pro-actively and on your own terms. It’s better to shoot yourself in the foot, rather than having someone else shoot you in the head.      But the road to disruption is paved with some casualties. Because the blockchain is a value disruptor, it will change the role of existing intermediaries. Some will get replaced, others will see their powers, influence and usage diminished. In the trading space, some of the current intermediaries at risk include SWIFT, CCP, FIX and the DTCC.    The first blinker    So, who will blink first? That first blink means buying a bitcoin exchange and totally incorporating its wallet into online banking. I know some libertarians will say that’s not what bitcoin was about. Bitcoin is about freedom to be your own bank. They are right, and with the passage of time and further sophistication, that might be possible. But in the meantime, you are the Bank, and you have a chance to keep that customer relationship going.      This revolution isn’t happening at Money 20/20, Finovate or Sibos. It’s happening elsewhere. It’s happening at the grass root levels in meetups, in stealth startups, accelerators and Github repositories.      [post-quote]      And user-initiated blockchain apps are coming. They will look like SaaS apps that users can launch without anyone’s permission. Wow, that’s a lot of change. If you’re a banking executive, maybe I’ve got more of your attention, now.      The banks have an opportunity to re-engineer themselves. They missed doing that when the Internet came along. It’s not about bitcoin. It’s about exposing openness, decentralization, and speed. Consumers and business users want that.      The meaning of trust and transactions changes with the blockchain. Every centralized and manual process is up for grabs due to what the blockchain enables: self-enforcement of trust and smarter transactions with longer end-points.      The blockchain has a diverse stack, and I hope that a bank can touch it at many levels.      Bitcoin isn’t easy to use, blockchains are difficult to program, most merchants aren’t accepting cryptocurrency, and it does sound risky to rely on computers and mathematics to govern a currency, but so what?      If you don’t take bitcoin, blockchains and cryptocurrency seriously, I can predict that bitcoin will be to banks what the iPhone was to BlackBerry. Yes, it was not perfect when it came out, and didn’t have a keyboard, didn’t have apps, and wasn’t “secure” for corporates, but so what?      The blockchain is not perfect, but it is that perfect catalyst for business process changes, and this type of opportunity doesn’t present itself that often. The last time it came was with the Internet. Let’s hope the banks see this as a big opportunity for change, not just a small one.      The possibilities that are enabled by the blockchain have a transformational impact, once you put them together.      You can go slow and be left behind, or you can go deep and leapfrog. It is a case of experimentation, but also of determination.
