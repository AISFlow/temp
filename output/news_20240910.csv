The latest purchase brings Metaplanet’s total holdings to 398.832, with a total aggregate cost of 3.75 billion yen ($26 million), averaging slightly above $65,700 per BTC. Related Reading: Research Firm Predicts Bitcoin Game Theory In Global Adoption Race Bitcoin price is up 3.4% in the past 24 hours, trading at $57,159 at press time. Notably, the US Federal Reserve is expected to embark on its rate-cut cycle next week, with many expecting the injection of liquidity into the economy to benefit risk-on assets such as Bitcoin. According to data from Google Finance, Tokyo-listed Metaplanet’s stock was exchanging hands at 1101 yen ($7.7), surging by 5.87% in today’s trading session. On the contrary, the Nikkei 225 index dipped slightly by 0.16%. Yesterday, Metaplanet disclosed that its management will exercise the 11th series of stock acquisition rights. The total proceeds from exercise warrants are expected to be around 299.7 million yen ($2.10 million). The company noted that these proceeds will be used to purchase more BTC. Close followers of the crypto industry would remember that it was back in May 2024 when Metaplanet first made public its plans to embrace BTC as its strategic treasury reserve asset. At the time, the company emphasized its new “Bitcoin-first, Bitcoin-only approach,” akin to the strategy adopted by MicroStrategy. In July 2024, Metaplanet increased its BTC holdings by 20.195, purchased at about $1.2 million according to prevailing market prices. Over the past few months, a series of Bitcoin purchases has brought Metaplanet’s total holdings to almost 400 BTC. Following In The Footsteps Of MicroStrategy Metaplanet’s decision to adopt Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset isn’t a new practice among publicly listed companies. US-based MicroStrategy has championed Bitcoin’s reliability unlike any other institution. Related Reading: MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor Calls Bitcoin An Institutional-Grade Asset Destined For $1 Million On August 8, 2024, MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor revealed that he owns more than $1 billion worth of Bitcoin and has no plans to sell it anytime soon. According to the current market price, this is not to be confused with MicroStrategy’s own Bitcoin holdings of 226,500 BTC worth almost $13 billion. Most recently, Saylor predicted that Bitcoin price could soar as high as $13 million per BTC by 2045. Given the reasoning behind this ambitious price target, Saylor said that currently, BTC only represents about 0.1% of the global capital. Once this proportion rises to 7%, BTC could be worth $13 million per unit. That being said, it’s probably wise not to think too far ahead and consider some of the immediate challenges that Bitcoin might face. For instance, all eyes will be on the US Federal Reserve next week as there are fears that slashing the interest rates by too much, too quickly, might adversely affect BTC prices.

33436726,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640921,1726002051,"Bitcoin Sees 2 Consecutive Heikin Ashi Signals On The Weekly Chart, What This Means","Crypto analyst Jesse Olson has highlighted the second consecutive Heikin Ashi signal on the Bitcoin (BTC) weekly chart. This comes despite Bitcoin’s recent rise to as high as $58,000, which suggests that a bullish reversal might be on the horizon. What The Heikin Ashi Signal Means For Bitcoin While highlighting the second consecutive Heikin Ashi on Bitcoin‘s weekly chart, Olson also noted that there was no wick to the upside, which suggests that the downside trend is likely to continue. The crypto analyst had also previously explained how the absence of a wick to the upside signals a strength in momentum to the downside. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Dogecoin Will Rise 3,600% To $3.7, Here’s When Based on Olson’s accompanying chart, Bitcoin could suffer further downward pressure and drop to as low as $40,000. This bearish analysis comes amid Bitcoin’s recovery as its price rose to $58,000 in the last 24 hours. Although it remains to be seen whether it is a relief bounce or a bullish reversal, Olson’s analysis suggests that it is more likely a relief bounce. However, crypto analyst Daan Crypto has suggested that Bitcoin needs to successfully break above $60,000 to achieve a bullish reversal and aim for new highs in this market cycle. Meanwhile, contrary to Olson’s bearish analysis, crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto has provided a more bullish outlook for Bitcoin. In an X (formerly Twitter) post, the crypto analyst stated that Bitcoin has completed the bullish diamond formation. In line with this, Mikybull Crypto remarked that he believes the bottom is in for Bitcoin if the bull market is still on. In another X post, Mikybull Crypto highlighted a bullish divergence recently formed on Bitcoin’s chart, similar to one in September 2023. Following the bullish divergence in September 2023, BTC experienced a significant rally, which ultimately paved the way for reaching a new all-time high (ATH) in March earlier this year. As such, something similar could happen again as Bitcoin tries to reach new highs. BTC’s Price Rally Could Begin After September Considering Bitcoin’s historical bearish trend in September, the crypto community is optimistic that BTC could begin its long-awaited price rally once this month is over. In a recent analysis, crypto analyst Rekt Capital explained why the flagship crypto would likely record massive gains in October. Related Reading: Ethereum Forms Falling Wedge Pattern That Could Send Price To $3,000 The crypto analyst noted that Bitcoin’s only monthly losses in October were in 2014 and 2018, when it recorded monthly losses of -12.95% and -3.83%, respectively. He added that those were bear markets. However, Bitcoin is in a halving year, historically ushering in the bull market. As such, BTC could enjoy a bullish ride in October and even to the end of the year, especially with the upcoming US presidential elections in November. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $56,600, up over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

The largest crypto's price was nearing $58,000 late in the U.S. trading session, up 1.7% in the past 24 hours and higher by nearly 10% from last Friday's low. Ether {{ETH}} and solana {{SOL}} each advanced 1.5% over the past day.  Toncoin {{TON}}, Artificial Superintelligence Alliance {{FET}} and Internet Computer {{ICP}} were the biggest gainers among altcoin majors, advancing 5%-8%. The broad-market benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index climbed 1.3% to 1,835, with 16 out of its 20 constituents advancing during the day.  Chances are low that crypto gets a mention during tonight's U.S. presidential debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, but the striking contrast between the two parties' approach on digital assets, and what their leadership would mean for prices, nevertheless lends importance to the event.  Uncertainty around the election will likely weigh on crypto prices until November, said Aurelie Barthere, principal research analyst at Nansen, but today's debate ""could bring a small breather [as] Harris’ lead in the polls might erode somewhat as the tailwinds of the Democratic National Convention fade.""  While investors are still fearful of further downside, one reliable metric foreshadows a significant rally in the coming weeks and months, a Tuesday market report by K33 Research said.  The 30-day average funding rates for perpetual swaps slid to negative levels, which has only happened six times since 2018, according to the report.  ""In the past, monthly funding rates hitting negative levels have coincided with a market bottom,"" K33 analysts Vetle Lunde and David Zimmerman wrote.  Based on the previous occasions when the metric flipped negative, the average return in the following 90-day period was 79% with the median 90-day return being 55%, the report said.  Open interest for derivatives, meanwhile, gradually climbed to the highest level since late July as shorts piled in. This, combined with persistent negative funding rates, leaves the market for potential short squeezes, according to the report.

42417275,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTXq7J,1725997813,"Bitcoin ETFs Are Fine Despite Suffering Their Worst String of Outflows, Says Expert","U.S.-traded spot bitcoin ETFs saw $1.2 billion in outflows between Aug. 27 and Sept. 6.  This marked the longest streak of outflows since the launch of the funds, but it signals nothing but healthy growth, an expert said.  The recent plunge in the price of bitcoin {{BTC}} was accompanied by a sizable amount of net outflows from the 12 U.S. spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). While on its face, that might appear worrisome, it's more likely a sign of healthy growth.  “This is going to be two steps forward, one step back,"" Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, said. ""That’s the way many ETF categories are born and mature,” he added. “Nothing goes up in a straight line – flow-wise – ever because ETFs service long term investors and traders.”  The funds bled roughly $1.2 billion worth of bitcoin between Aug. 27 and Sept. 6, according to data from Farside Investors. At eight, that was the most consecutive days of net outflows that the ETFs have experienced since launching on Jan. 12.  The $1.2 billion represented roughly 3% of total assets in the funds, which, according to Bianco Research, stood at $46 billion after the outflows. Balchunas said a worrisome number would be more like 15%-20%.  The ETF issuers have mostly been blessed with sizable amounts of cash flowing into their newly-opened funds. In their first two months of trading, the ETFs saw net inflows totallng $12 billion, according to Bianco Research. Not as bullish on the funds as Balchunas, Bianco noted that the pace of inflows has since slowed, with just $4 billion of new money over the next six months, including only $1 billion over the past three months.  “The key to building a category isn't so much taking in money when there's good times, but it's limiting the outflows at bad times and I've seen these Bitcoin ETFs do a great job in the latter,” Balchunas said, referring to recent large price sell-offs associated with Mt. Gox and the German government, during which the ETFs quickly reverted to inflows after seeing only modest exits of money..  “The [ETFs have] really done a good job keeping bitcoin out of the abyss,"" said Balchunas.

33434076,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640958,1725996653,Will Polkadot Accept This Major Request From A RWA Platform? DOT Down 65%,"Centrifuge, a real-world asset (RWA) solution and a Parachain, has a plan for Polkadot, a smart contracts platform. In a proposal, the RWA platform suggests that the newly created Polkadot Community Foundation allocates $3 million USDC to their T-Bill pool. This pool is held within the Anemoy Liquid Treasury Fund and aims to serve multiple objectives. Centrifuge Wants Polkadot To Invest $3 Million In T-Bills In their proposal, allocating the $3 million to T-Bill as an investment will benefit the broader ecosystem. Of note, it will help boost the long-term sustainability of the Polkadot Treasury. This is because the T-Bill pool will generate stable yields from real-world assets, thereby further increasing the financial health of the Treasury. Related Reading: Cardano Foundation Reports Massive Growth In These Key Metrics – ADA Price Soars 3% Though the funds will be from the foundation, Centrifuge argues that injecting the $3 million USDC into the T-Bill pool will help increase the network’s total value locked (TVL). Subsequently, this will also expand the Treasury’s assets. The foundation might consider investing in RWAs, as proposed by Centrifuge, as it could foster the growth of this technology within Polkadot, pushing adoption and growth as a result. Laying out their proposal, Centrifuge said if the foundation decides to invest, it would align with their previous investment in the Anemoy Liquid Treasury Fund. In turn, this may offer a unique opportunity for Polkadot to diversify and expand its investment basket. It is especially now that tokenization and RWA is picking up momentum. RWA Picking Up Steam, Will DOT Reverse Losses? BlackRock, one of the top asset managers in the world, is one of the leaders in tokenizing treasury bills. On Ethereum, the manager has launched BUIDL, a platform where institutions can invest in tokenized Treasury bills. As of September 10, BUIDL is the largest tokenized Treasuries provider, managing over $514 million, according to RWA.xyz. The proposal is so far garnering community support. Roughly a week before the decision, over 53% agreed with this proposal. However, some community members are expressing concerns. Related Reading: Ethereum Sees Massive Outflows from Derivatives: What Does This Mean For ETH? Most of them point to the potential risks and the negative implications of this on the network’s Treasury. One concern is that if this is approved, it could increase DOT spending requests, eventually depleting its reserves. While the prospect of RWA taking off in Polkadot is bullish, DOT is still under pressure. From the daily chart, DOT is down roughly 65% from March highs. It is also in a descending channel and retesting multi-month support. The primary support lies at around $3.5. On the upper end, resistance is at $5. A break above this line will lift sentiment, propelling the coin towards $6.5 in a buy trend continuation formation.

33432948,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641049,1725994366,Bitcoin Shakeout Ahead: Analysts Predict Final Dip Before Bull Run Resumes,"The Bitcoin market has seen some consolidation since Monday, maintaining a price above the $56,000 mark after a brief drop from $65,000 to around $52,600 last Friday. However, one analyst suggests that the bearish sentiment may still be ongoing, with expectations of a potential revisit to lower levels before a significant upward movement. BTC’s Future Price Action In Focus Crypto analysts known as “VirtualBacon” on X (formerly Twitter) have raised concerns about an impending “huge Bitcoin shakeout.” In the coming 2-3 weeks, the analyst explains that Bitcoin could experience one last decline before initiating a bull run. “Panic is everywhere—people are calling for lows in the $40,000s, claiming the bull run is over,” VirtualBacon noted. Yet, he argues that whether Bitcoin dips to $45,000, $48,000, or even $43,000, a bull run remains on the horizon. This period often sees a shakeout of many holders right before significant rallies. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Surges Past $130 Resistance As Funding Rate Signals Bullish Momentum While the current charts indicate lower highs and lower lows, suggesting a downtrend, VirtualBacon believes that a prolonged bear market appears unlikely. The primary driver of this sentiment is the anticipated liquidity injection and interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, conditions that typically favor a bull run, particularly looking ahead to 2025. Another crucial aspect of VirtualBacon’s analysis lies in Bitcoin’s key support level—the 100-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA). This level has historically marked the end of bear markets, with Bitcoin bouncing off similar levels in 2015 and 2019. Currently, this support level sits around $45,000, with various technical indicators, including Fibonacci retracements and high-volume nodes, suggesting strong support in the $43,000 to $49,000 range. Even if Bitcoin does dip into this range, the analyst believes it would likely be a temporary “wick” rather than a sustained drop. VirtualBacon also highlights that some traders speculate about around $50,000 to $51,000. However, this could be risky; a touch at these levels might trigger a cascading liquidation event that could push prices to $44,000. How Upcoming Fed Decisions May Fuel Bitcoin Bullish Momentum Historically, September has been a weaker month for Bitcoin. However, the upcoming months—October, November, and December—tend to show more bullish trends. VirtualBacon notes that over the last decade, eight out of ten Octobers have ended positively for Bitcoin, with November also historically strong. The backdrop of this market analysis coincides with the Federal Reserve’s upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, where the analyst predicts a 70% chance of a 25 basis point rate cut and a 30% chance of a double cut. VirtualBacon notes that this could initiate a 12-month liquidity injection cycle that typically boosts risk assets like BTC and propels the leading cryptocurrency above current all-time high levels of $73,700. Related Reading: Ethereum In 3 Months: Legendary Analyst Reveals Prediction For December Despite the prevailing fear in the market, as the Fear and Greed Index indicates, the analyst argues that this fear may be irrational, especially with the impending monetary policy shifts. As the Fed begins to cut rates, sentiment is expected to shift rapidly, potentially leading to renewed interest and investment in Bitcoin. BTC trades at $56,930 when writing, recording a slightly 0.7% gain in the last 24 hours.

According to Armstrong, that would give everyone an equal landscape which in turn would then provide a huge capital influx to the crypto space. Concerning legislation, Armstrong stated: “If we get legislation passed in the US similar to how it's already been passed in Europe and other places. I think we'll see a huge inflow of capital,” speaking at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology conference. The Coinbase ( COIN ) top boss went on to add that “America is going to eventually get this right because the rest of the G20 have already moved down this path, most of them already either have legislation passed or it's currently being worked on and so America can't afford to wait too much longer.” Crypto has also now become a major focus point for political figures in Washington, and this current presidential election will be interesting for the crypto arena, as Armstrong noted that some “candidates [are] making it a core part of their platform.” The cryptocurrency exchange platform executive went on to express that any adoption in legislation will be a good sign for the industry, just as was seen with the growth of ETFs around Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). For future costs to come down in the crypto space, Alesia Haas, CFO of Coinbase ( COIN ), said that first crypto needs to become fully commoditized and adopted by all players. “I do not yet think crypto is commoditized. I think that we will not see spread compression until you get to crypto being adopted by every bank, every FinTech in the ecosystem, and then you drive commoditization, in which case, then you'll start to see fee compression,” Haas said. Coinbase Global price action: +98.3% over a 1-year period, -12.9% year-to-date, -40.1% over the past 6-months, and -19.5% over the past 1-month.

This breakout has caught the attention of investors, who now anticipate a potential price surge in the coming months as market sentiment remains optimistic. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) 180-Day Consolidation Set to Break: Massive Rally Just Around the Corner? Many analysts are forecasting further gains, pointing to Solana’s recent performance as a key indicator of its strength. Investors are particularly focused on SOL’s ability to maintain its momentum, with growing demand and increased interest fueling bullish predictions for the altcoin. In addition to market enthusiasm, Coinglass’s on-chain metrics reveal a positive outlook for Solana. These metrics reinforce the bullish momentum, suggesting a potential Solana rally. As more investors look to capitalize on these trends, Solana’s performance could soon play a crucial role in determining the overall market direction for altcoins. Solana On-Chain Metrics Suggest Strength Solana is currently testing local supply and attempting to break past a crucial daily resistance level at $137l, as on-chain metrics from Coinglass reveal a strong bullish sentiment among traders and investors. One key metric highlighting this bullish sentiment is Solana’s Open Interest (OI)-Weighted Funding Rate, which currently stands at +0.0068%. When the funding rate is positive, traders holding long positions pay funding fees to those with short positions, which typically indicates expectations for rising prices. This suggests bullish momentum is building, with traders anticipating a short-term rally in Solana’s price. The growing interest from long positions further supports the thesis that Solana may be gearing up for a price surge. Bulls dominate the asset, and the data indicates a strong possibility that SOL could break out of its current trading range if the market conditions remain favorable. However, for this bullish outlook to hold, Solana must break through its current resistance level at $138 and close a daily candle above this key point. If the price breaks and holds above $138, it could signal a potential move toward higher price targets in the coming weeks. Related Reading: Avalanche (AVAX) Ready To Target $28: Investors Expect A Reversal As the market evolves, traders will closely watch Solana’s price action and market structure to gauge whether a significant rally is imminent. In the meantime, Solana continues to show promise, with bullish indicators supporting a positive short-term outlook for the asset. SOL Price Action Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $135, just 4.5% away from a crucial technical indicator: the 4-hour 200 exponential moving average (EMA), which sits at $141.14. This level is a key marker of strength for SOL, and reclaiming it would signal that the bulls are gaining momentum. If SOL successfully breaks through the $135 resistance level and reclaims the 4-hour 200 EMA, it could trigger a significant upward move toward the $160 supply zone. This would mark a major recovery for the asset, potentially attracting more buyers and pushing the price higher. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Rally Brewing? On-Chain Metrics Suggest Investors Optimism However, if Solana fails to break past the $135 resistance, a retracement to lower demand levels is likely. $126 is the buyers’ next potential support level to step in and prevent a price drop. As SOL continues to test these key levels, traders are watching closely to see whether the bulls can maintain control or if a correction is on the horizon.

However, while BNX enjoys its newfound popularity, investors are beginning to eye Mpeppe (MPEPE), a rising meme coin that promises Dogecoin-like gains. Here’s why both tokens are attracting serious attention from investors and what lies ahead for these exciting projects. BinaryX (BNX) Enters the Top 100: A Milestone Worth Celebrating BinaryX (BNX) recently made waves by entering the top 100 cryptocurrencies. This leap is the result of BinaryX (BNX)’s innovative platform focused on GameFi and decentralized finance (DeFi) services. BNX’s performance and traction reflect the growing interest in blockchain gaming, and the project is quickly becoming a leading force in this sector. Investors are excited, but Mpeppe (MPEPE) is capturing their attention as well. Mpeppe (MPEPE): The Meme Coin Revolution Inspired by Pepecoin Mpeppe (MPEPE) is much more than a meme cryptocurrency; it draws inspiration from Pepecoin, which has been a monumental force in the world of digital assets. Like Pepecoin, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is harnessing the power of internet culture and memes to build a movement that goes beyond financial gain. The Mpeppe (MPEPE) token seeks to unite global sports enthusiasts, leveraging crypto and sports-related memes to create an interactive and vibrant community. Dogecoin’s Legacy: Can Mpeppe (MPEPE) Deliver Similar Gains? Investors who witnessed the astronomical rise of Dogecoin (DOGE) are now looking at Mpeppe (MPEPE) with similar expectations. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s strategic approach of combining meme culture, sports fandom, and blockchain innovation offers a unique investment opportunity. Many believe that Mpeppe (MPEPE) could replicate Dogecoin’s legendary run, given its robust community-driven initiatives and well-thought-out tokenomics. BinaryX (BNX) and Mpeppe (MPEPE): Two Unique Projects With Massive Potential While BNX focuses on the GameFi sector, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is leading the charge in meme-based crypto innovations. Both projects are capturing different sectors of the market, but they share one thing in common: they have the potential for explosive growth. BinaryX (BNX)’s rise into the top 100 is a testament to its strength in the gaming space, but Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s sports betting and meme-based ecosystem is poised to draw attention from a wider audience. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s Charitable and Community-Driven Projects: Real-World Impact What sets Mpeppe (MPEPE) apart from other meme coins is its focus on real-world change. Like Pepecoin, Mpeppe (MPEPE) uses its influence to support charitable initiatives, crowdfunding efforts, and community-driven projects. This social responsibility adds value to the token beyond mere speculation, as investors are keen to support a project that aligns with their values while offering the potential for significant returns. BNX Investors Seek Diversification With Mpeppe (MPEPE) As BinaryX (BNX) continues to rise, investors are looking for ways to diversify their portfolios. Mpeppe (MPEPE) presents a compelling alternative. While BinaryX (BNX) excels in blockchain gaming, Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s focus on meme culture and sports provides a different type of excitement. Investors are starting to see the value in spreading their assets across these two innovative projects, hoping to capitalize on the growing markets of both GameFi and meme cryptocurrencies. Conclusion: Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s Dogecoin-Like Potential Is Just Beginning The rise of Mpeppe (MPEPE) comes at a time when investors are actively searching for the next big meme coin to rival the success of Dogecoin. While BinaryX (BNX) has found success in the GameFi sector, Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s combination of meme culture, sports, and casino gaming makes it a compelling option for anyone looking for massive returns. The potential for Dogecoin-like gains is there, and with a growing community and strategic tokenomics, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is poised to become the next big thing in crypto.

Recently, a group of ETH whales allocated a significant $2.1 million across Sui (SUI) and the new Ethereum-based gambling casino ICO, Mpeppe (MPEPE). This move has sparked widespread interest within the crypto community as investors explore the future potential of both projects. Let’s dive into why these two tokens are capturing the attention of whales and what it means for investors. The Rise of Sui: A Blockchain Built for Scalability Sui (SUI) has quickly become a hot topic among crypto investors, particularly for its focus on scalability and speed. This next-generation blockchain platform offers fast and efficient transactions, making it highly appealing to developers and users alike. With ETH whales showing confidence in Sui (SUI), it’s clear that this project is viewed as a critical player in the future of decentralized finance (DeFi) and decentralized applications (dApps). Mpeppe (MPEPE): A Casino Coin with Real-World Utility While Mpeppe (MPEPE) started as a meme coin, it has evolved into a powerful token with real-world utility. The Mpeppe (MPEPE) ecosystem revolves around an innovative gambling and sports betting platform, where users can earn rewards by participating in various games and activities. As Ethereum-based gambling platforms continue to grow in popularity, Mpeppe (MPEPE) stands out as a key contender in this space, offering investors the potential for massive returns. Privacy for Casino Players One of the significant advantages of Mpeppe (MPEPE) is its ability to offer enhanced security and privacy to online gamblers. Cryptocurrencies like MPEPE introduce a new level of privacy protection, safeguarding user data and ensuring secure transactions. As privacy concerns become more prominent, Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s focus on security is a critical factor driving the interest of ETH whales. Breaking Down Barriers The Mpeppe (MPEPE) platform allows for global access to online gambling without the need for traditional banking methods. By utilizing cryptocurrencies, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has overcome geographical restrictions, providing users with seamless transactions across borders. This global accessibility has made the project highly attractive to investors looking for innovative solutions within the online casino space. Sui’s Innovative Approach to Blockchain Technology In addition to its scalability, Sui (SUI) offers a high-performance blockchain infrastructure that can support a variety of decentralized applications. With more projects launching on Sui (SUI), the platform’s ecosystem continues to grow, making it a promising long-term investment.

33430149,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641035,1725988758,"Experts Hint Bitcoin (BTC)s Recovery To Boost Uniswap (UNI), Mpeppe (MPEPE) and Solana (SOL)","With Bitcoin (BTC) poised for recovery, experts suggest that this bullish momentum could provide a significant boost to several altcoins, including Uniswap (UNI), Mpeppe (MPEPE), and Solana (SOL). Each of these projects is uniquely positioned to ride the wave of Bitcoin (BTC)’s resurgence, and their ecosystems offer compelling reasons for investors to pay close attention. Let’s dive into how Bitcoin (BTC)’s recovery could positively impact these three altcoins. Uniswap (UNI): The Decentralized Exchange Leader Positioned for Growth As one of the most established decentralized exchanges (DEX) in the crypto space, Uniswap (UNI) stands to benefit immensely from Bitcoin (BTC)’s price recovery. A rising Bitcoin (BTC) often leads to increased trading activity across the entire crypto market, and Uniswap (UNI), with its highly liquid markets and easy-to-use platform, is primed to capture a significant portion of this surge. Why Uniswap (UNI) Will Benefit from Bitcoin (BTC)’s Recovery Bitcoin (BTC)’s recovery tends to attract renewed interest in altcoins, which increases the need for decentralized exchanges like Uniswap (UNI). As more traders swap tokens and seek decentralized solutions, Uniswap (UNI)’s trading volumes and user engagement are likely to skyrocket. Mpeppe (MPEPE): The Meme Coin with Utility Ready to Explode Mpeppe (MPEPE), a meme cryptocurrency with a real-world utility in the gambling and sports betting space, is another altcoin poised for substantial gains alongside Bitcoin (BTC)’s recovery. While most meme coins rely solely on community hype, Mpeppe (MPEPE) sets itself apart by offering users access to De-Fi liquidity pools and gaming profits. How Mpeppe (MPEPE) Will Capitalize on the Bullish Market Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s innovative approach to combining meme culture and practical utility has positioned it as a frontrunner in the meme coin sector. Bitcoin (BTC)’s resurgence typically brings a wave of retail investors, many of whom are drawn to speculative assets like meme coins. Mpeppe (MPEPE), with its growing community and expanding ecosystem, is expected to capture the attention of these investors, potentially leading to a significant price surge. Solana (SOL): A High-Performance Blockchain Positioned for Mass Adoption Solana (SOL), known for its high-speed transactions and low fees, has established itself as a leading blockchain for decentralized applications (dApps) and NFTs. As Bitcoin (BTC) recovers, investor confidence in the broader market tends to improve, and this could drive more developers and projects to build on Solana (SOL)’s robust infrastructure. Why Solana (SOL) Is a Top Contender in a Bull Market Solana (SOL)’s scalability and efficiency make it an ideal blockchain for handling increased traffic and transaction volume, which often comes with a Bitcoin (BTC)-led market rally. Additionally, Solana (SOL)’s ecosystem of dApps, NFTs, and DeFi projects could experience a surge in user activity, further boosting SOL’s price. Why Bitcoin (BTC)’s Recovery Matters for the Altcoin Market Bitcoin (BTC)’s price rises, influencing altcoins like Uniswap (UNI), Mpeppe (MPEPE), and Solana (SOL). This creates a ripple effect, with liquidity flowing from Bitcoin (BTC) into high-potential altcoins. Projects like Uniswap (UNI), Mpeppe (MPEPE), and Solana (SOL), backed by strong fundamentals and innovative use cases, are likely to see an influx of interest and capital during Bitcoin (BTC)’s recovery. Conclusion: The Time to Watch Uniswap (UNI), Mpeppe (MPEPE), and Solana (SOL) Is Now As Bitcoin (BTC) recovers, the altcoin market is expected to follow suit, with Uniswap (UNI), Mpeppe (MPEPE), and Solana (SOL) emerging as potential investors. These tokens offer unique advantages, such as decentralized exchange models, gaming utility, and a rapidly growing blockchain ecosystem, making them attractive for investors.

42417287,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTXqKj,1725988206,Ethena's Yield Machine Sees $1B Outflows as Crypto Market Cools – But There's Good News,"The market cap of Ethena's USDe token fell below $2.7 billion from $3.6 billion as demand faltered.  The protocol generates yield for investors by shorting bitcoin and ether derivatives in a ""carry trade,"" but funding rates have turned negative over the past weeks.  Even so, the token's price held stable around $1 during the unwinding, defying early concerns of a downard spiral.  Crypto yield protocol Ethena, which skyrocketed earlier this year to over $3.6 billion in deposits, faced its biggest test as crypto markets cooled off and investors pulled the funds that backed its USDe synthetic dollar token. Even so, USDe held steady to its $1 peg.  The protocol has endured nearly $1 billion in outflows since July, DefiLlama data shows. That's a 27% decrease in the token's supply. The protocol's governance token, ethena (ENA), has tumbled 85% from its April high.  The decline coincided with funding rates for crypto perpetual futures, a key source of yield for USDe, falling to near-zero in the past few weeks. They hit an annual 40%-70% in March.  ""Lower funding rates makes it less attractive to hold and stake USDe,"" Julio Moreno, an analyst at CryptoQuant, said in an interview with CoinDesk.  USDe uses bitcoin {{BTC}} and ether {{ETH}} as backing assets, pairing them with an equal-value short perpetual futures position on exchanges. Perpetual funding rates are usually positive, which means Ethena's USDe generates revenue on its backing derivative assets.  ""One of the most important risks USDe faces is an environment of sustained negative funding rates in the perpetual futures market,"" Moreno said. ""In this scenario, Ethena would need to pay funding in order to keep its short positions open.""  The yield offered to USDe tumbled to 4.4% from its March peak of over 50%, according to DefiLlama. That's lower than less risky investments such as a vanilla money-market fund or other Treasury-backed digital token offerings.  Price stability  Skeptics raised concerns about Ethena's model, likening it to the imploded stablecoin project Terra-Luna. Terra's algorithmic stablecoin fell into a spiral in May 2022 after its subsidized growth ran out of fuel, kickstarting a brutal crypto winter.  Read more: Ethena Labs Divides Opinion as High Yield Stirs Memories of Terra  The current, unfavorable market environment and flurry of withdrawals offered a chance to prove the protocol's stability.  ""We are pleased with how Ethena has responded to multiple deep market corrections in the last few months,"" said Guy Young, co-founder and CEO of the protocol's development firm, Ethena Labs. ""Stress tests were always going to surface, and growing at the pace we were indefinitely is clearly not possible.""  The price of USDe remained stable at its $1 peg during the outflows, and the subsequent unwinding of trading positions to meet demand for withdrawals happened ""all orderly with zero issues experienced on the US dollar peg,"" Young added.  Ethena keeps a ""rainy day"" fund, known as the reserve fund, to pay for funding rates if needed.  To minimize protocol risks, the reserve should stand at least at 1% of USDe supply, CryptoQuant's Moreno said.  ""This is the case at the moment, as the reserve fund stands at $45 million, which is around 1.6% of the current USDe market capitalization,"" Moreno said. ""Investors need to watch this key metric to assess Ethena’s risk.""",NEGATIVE,BTC | ENA,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | ENA,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/09/10/ethenas-yield-machine-sees-1b-outflows-as-crypto-market-cools-but-theres-good-news,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/12aadf777b36dc32a0cd75e657cfee15fdcd5e22-1893x1065.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42417276,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTXq9N,1725986911,Why Every Crypto Founder Must Master Political Strategy,"I live and breathe politics. I’ve worked closely with politicians and government ministries. I believe it’s the most beautiful, challenging, and interesting game in the world. You’re probably familiar with the saying, “I’m not here for the money, I’m here for the tech.” For me, it’s more like, “I’m not here for the tech, I’m here for the politics.”  Yes, I know — most of you fall somewhere on the spectrum between not understanding, ignoring, or outright despising politics. But the hard truth is, that without knowing how the game works or leveraging the power of politics in your venture, you’re likely to fail.  Politics is everywhere. And I’m not talking about your local government or national elections. I’m talking about the everyday politics that influence every decision,, success, or failure in the world — even in your new protocol. To succeed, you must understand what really motivates people, how to direct a divided community toward your goals,, and how to communicate your vision clearly. Unfortunately, most founders don’t get politics. They probably watched Silicon Valley instead of Veep or House of Cards. The word itself makes them sick. They make the crucial mistake of not knowing how the game is played and what drives our world.  Why politics matters  Now, you might be thinking, “But crypto is decentralized, distributed, and permissionless — no room for politics here.” Let me chuckle a little and share a secret: there’s no escape from politics, especially in crypto. The openness of this market makes the politics around it much more complicated and challenging. If you don’t understand the crypto political landscape — if you don’t know how to build a coalition and balance different motivations and interests, — you’re setting yourself up for a rough ride.  So, how do you act as a politician? Let’s explore some diplomatic strategies. For an outsider (meaning the vast majority of the world that hasn’t taken the red pill of politics), diplomatic moves might seem hidden, shady, or even dirty. But in reality, it’s quite the opposite. Politics is more like a chess game. All the players and their power are on the table, transparent for all to see. All the potential moves and tricks are available to everyone. The game then becomes about execution, driven by your intellect and status.  Politicians from different parties will engage with each other if both stand to gain, as the power dynamics are clear to everyone involved. When speaking to one another, politicians don’t beat around the bush. They know the rules of the game, and they want to win. They also know they can never win alone — without their party colleagues, and even without their opponents. When the rules of the game are open to everyone, it increases transparency and directness. Ironically, this creates an environment that fosters execution.  Four Personas That Drive the Game  In crypto, the leaders who will impact your venture are as diverse as they come. You’ve got traders chasing profits, builders trying to solve real-world problems, tech purists pushing the boundaries of innovation, and storytellers shaping the narrative. Each leading group has its own motivations, its own interests, and often, they contradict each other. The art of a successful founder, then, is to recognize these differences and figure out how to unite them in pursuit of your vision. From now on, you’re an emerging president who’s trying to unite four different parties into a strong coalition to fulfill your mission with the people (end-users), provide security, wealth, prosperity, and a bright future.  So how do you do it? How do you take four groups with different, sometimes opposing interests and get them all moving in the same direction? It starts with deeply understanding the four personas that drive the crypto market.  1. The Tech Purist: Here for the Tech  The tech purist doesn’t care about your token price. They’re here for the tech. They live for breakthrough technological innovations — new consensus mechanisms, cutting-edge encryption methods. If it pushes the boundaries of what’s possible in the code or the algorithm, they’re all in. But don’t expect them to care about revenue, adoption, or market success. People like Vitalik Buterin or Nick Szabo are most loyal to the code and the technology, and less obsessed with marketing or branding. They will dive deep into your white papers, scrutinize your security protocols, and engage in endless debates about scalability. Ignore them, and you risk alienating the very people who can validate your tech’s legitimacy.  2. Traders: Here for the Money  On the other side of the spectrum is the trader who tends to be cynical, sharp, and always on the lookout for the next big play. For them, the entire crypto market is one giant casino, and they’re here to maximize their gains. Profit is the only KPI. Technology? That’s just a narrative — a story to trade on. They’re constantly calculating whether your innovation is “priced in” or if there’s more juice left to squeeze. They’ll pump your project one day and dump it the next. If you want people like Arthur Hayes or Andrew Kang on your side, you better have something that makes their investment worthwhile. But remember, they’re not in it for the long haul — they’re here to make a quick profit and move on. Understand their game, and you might just keep them interested long enough to benefit your project.  3. Builders: Here for Changing the World  Then there’s the builder. They’re not just here to innovate—they’re here to change the world. For them, blockchain is more than just a technology; it’s a tool to solve real-world problems. They see the flaws in existing systems and believe they can fix them, one block at a time. They’re not obsessed with the technology itself like the tech purist, but with the impact it can have. And while they know the market and trading dynamics are part of the game, they see it as secondary to their mission. People like Stani Kulechov or Hyden Adams could make or break your project — because they’ll become your design partner, build on top of your project, drive adoption, and turn your vision into reality. 4. Storytellers: Here for the Audience  Enter the journalists and publicists. The storytellers, the content creators, the influencers. They’re the ones who bridge the gap between the tech, the market, and the masses. In a space as complex and fast-moving as crypto, these personas are crucial. They gather the data, dissect it, and present it in a way that’s digestible for the wider audience. They control the narrative, and in this game, narrative is worth a lot. Storytellers can make or break a project by how they present it to the world. Some play it straight, reporting facts and letting the audience decide. Others, let’s be real, are in it for the clout — their goal is to build a following, gain recognition, and influence the market. But no matter where they fall on this spectrum, you need them in your corner. Without people like Laura Shin or Bankless, your project is just another drop in the crypto ocean.  As if your job wasn’t hard enough, you’ve also got the gatekeepers to contend with; the regulators. From the justice system, through government agencies, to your company’s legal team, they hold the keys to the game. Whether it’s regulating securities, derivatives, and futures, dealing with tax implications, anti-money laundering (AML) protocols, know-your-customer (KYC) regulations, or ensuring custody and monitoring to prevent deceptive financial practices, the spectrum of oversight is vast. Like it or not, they’re here to stay, and they wield significant power. In some countries more than others, but in every case, you can’t afford to ignore them. The gatekeepers can dramatically impact your vision and execution. Knowing the rules, learning them inside and out, and playing by them is essential — because they can easily obstruct your path to success if you don’t.  Building a Coalition That Works  Now that we’ve introduced the four personas (and the gatekeepers), let’s turn the focus back to you — the founder. Having a brilliant idea isn’t enough; Your job is to build a coalition that unites these parties, making sure each player has a seat at the table based on their power and potential impact on your venture.  I know, you want top venture capital firms to back you. You want the best teams building on your platform. You want rock-solid security, no hacks. You want explosive growth, to be the name on everyone’s lips, to land podcast interviews. You want all the TVL in the world. You want revenue, fees, and a token that outperforms the market. You want your airdrop to actually matter. You want end-users flocking to your innovation. You want your project to be a rocket ship, to dominate, to become the market leader.  Take EigenLayer, for example. The team nailed this balance. They didn’t just focus on the tech — although the new primitive of shared security certainly caught the tech purist’s eye, which participated from the get-go in a security committee to maximize risk management. They also made sure to secure enough funding from VCs (yes, they are here for the money as well, don’t be surprised), and incentivized traders with a pointing system, attracting ETH for staking, which secured the platform. Builders saw the potential to solve real problems using AVSs, leveraging Ethereum’s security. And let’s not forget the Storytellers who helped spread the word of restaking, discussing the implications of this new innovation across various platforms. This is the art of the possible — bringing together different parties with different interests, playing by the gatekeeper’s rules (successfully, so far), to create something that lasts (and is worth a lot, on-paper).  Navigating conflicting interests  What will happen if you can’t find the balance point and fail to bring a persona to the table? The Tech Purist will criticize your code and advise the core community to stay away from your smart contract. The Trader will find ways to manipulate your tokenomics. The Builder will choose your competitor’s layer. And the Storyteller will publicly tear you apart in front of your target audience. That’s just one possible outcome. They might also ignore you, or worse, never even hear about you. This is what happens to bad politicians too — they fail and disappear into oblivion. They fail because they are unfamiliar with or refuse to play by the rules of the game. They neglect groups within their ecosystem, turning potential catalysts for their goals into enemies. Don’t be like them.  Think of it like building a coalition in politics. A strong coalition doesn’t require everyone to agree on everything. It requires everyone to see a piece of their own interest in the broader goal. That’s what you need to create. You’re not just a founder — you’re a politician, a diplomat, a strategist. And if you can master this art, you’ll do more than just succeed — you’ll lead.

42407694,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga0x2o,1725986339,Stablecoins vs Tokenized Deposits: Why the Differences Matter,"Tokenized deposits and stablecoins may sound like the same thing, given that they are both fiat-on-chain. But they are actually distinct concepts, and the difference matters not just for use cases and our understanding of blockchain potential, but also for how regulation can evolve. They also both highlight, in different ways, how our understanding of money is changing.  Noelle Acheson is the former head of research at CoinDesk and Genesis Trading, and host of the CoinDesk Markets Daily podcast. This article is excerpted from her Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, which focuses on the overlap between the shifting crypto and macro landscapes. These opinions are hers, and nothing she writes should be taken as investment advice.  Tokenized deposits, sometimes known as deposit tokens, are blockchain representations of fiat currency bank deposits. They are issued by banks, backed by fiat deposits at those banks, and can run on either private or public blockchains (although, since these are heavily regulated entities, they’ll want complete control of access). In some cases, such as with JPMorgan’s JPM Coin, they are used to settle transactions between JPMorgan clients. In others, such as SocGen’s EURCV, they can be transferred to clients who do not have accounts at the issuer bank, but only after being whitelisted.  Tokenized deposits boost the efficiency of fiat by eliminating some steps in the execution of trade and settlement, while enhancing transparency and flexibility for their issuers.  Reserve stablecoins*, on the other hand, are blockchain tokens backed by a fiat currency. The issuer, which may or may not be a bank, promises to maintain the value of the token stable relative to the chosen fiat by allowing redemption at any time. (*Other types of “stablecoins,” such as algorithmic and yield-bearing, are different enough to be left out of this consideration for now.)  This may sound like a tokenized deposit, but it’s not. The stablecoin doesn’t represent the deposit, it is pegged to the fiat value via the backing reserves: a small distinction that makes a big difference.  The difference is operational, conceptual and legal.  They do different things  On the operational side, the transfer of a deposit token from one client to another usually triggers an off-chain transfer of fiat from one account to another. The tokens represent bank deposits, so the fiat account balances in theory have to match the token account balances.  Stablecoins, on the other hand, don’t involve adjusting fiat accounts in the background. They freely change hands between users, and the underlying reserve account doesn’t need to care. It just needs to be available for redemption on demand, it doesn’t matter by whom (this is a slight simplification as not everyone can redeem, but not a significant one – those who don’t redeem can exchange stablecoins for fiat on a number of platforms).  This leads us to the conceptual difference. Deposit tokens are designed to be a more liquid version of traditional deposits, not a substitute. They are not meant to replace fiat money, just make it more efficient.  Stablecoins, however, are more like a substitute. They were originally created as a way to avoid the need for fiat, back in the early days when crypto exchanges couldn’t get bank accounts. They rapidly became not just a workaround but a more efficient way (faster, cheaper) to move funds to and between exchanges, often preferred even when fiat onramps are available.  Deposit tokens are created by banks, for bank clients. They represent bank deposits.  Stablecoins were originally created for those who could not get bank accounts. They are a bank deposit substitute. They represent value, not a commercial arrangement.  What’s more, stablecoins are bearer instruments: whoever holds them, owns them. They are the asset.  Deposit tokens are not bearer instruments. They represent the asset, in this case, named deposits at a bank.  This brings us to the likely legal evolution of the two concepts. In principle, from the regulator’s point of view, bank deposit representations are fine, bank deposit substitutes are more problematic.  Here is where it gets particularly interesting, and where the two concepts unexpectedly start to blend.  Here is also where it gets philosophical.  What does that mean for future of money?  One of the underlying principles of money is its “singleness”, where a dollar is a dollar (to pick one currency), no matter who holds it or how. This is one of the reasons regulators want to control the issuance of dollars, to guarantee that one of the basic assumptions of monetary law will always hold. In a world with multiple dollar issuers and no central guarantor, perhaps not all dollars would be equal.  As we have seen, stablecoins don’t always fulfill “singleness.” One USDT or one USDC (to pick the two largest examples) are not always equivalent to one dollar, although they tend to revert to the underlying value. Therefore, regulators technically cannot consider them “money.” Plus, Tether (issuer of the market’s largest stablecoin USDT) is not insured by the FDIC, therefore the guarantees behind 1 USDT are not the same as those behind $1, which in theory could impact the monetary value.  So, what are stablecoins, then, if not “money”? Securities, along the lines of tradeable money market funds? That would be kind of weird because they are used as money, and they for sure don’t satisfy the Howey test prong of “expectation of profit.” “Common enterprise,” another Howey prong with success tied to a promoter or investor pool, would also be tough to prove.  What’s more, stablecoins fulfill the “establishment” definition of money: they settle transactions, they are widely accepted, they are the unit of account for many assets, they hold their value over time.  But they break the singleness requirement, which is a big deal for regulators who decide who can legally issue and use them.  And if they end up being classified as securities because of that lack of singleness, along the lines of non-yielding money market funds, then we have a melding of previously distinct concepts that could open up a deeper shift in how finance works. Securities, via stablecoins, could become a widely accepted money substitute.  A dollar but not a dollar  Okay, so deposit tokens could be considered money in the eyes of regulators, stablecoins bewilderingly not, right? Not so fast.  Deposit tokens may represent money, but that doesn’t mean they are, legally. For one, they are subject to different types of risk. Bank deposits are not actually all there – most are lent out or invested. So, in the event of a bank collapse, it could turn out that the deposit tokens don’t have the backing everyone thought. The same holds for deposits, but they’re usually at least partially insured. Tokenized deposits, for now, are not.  And a technological glitch could lead to payment misses or even duplication, possibly leading to the deposit token balances not matching the fiat account balances. How would that get resolved, and who would decide?  Furthermore, some innovative bank thinkers talk about the potential to introduce programmability to deposit tokens, enhancing their efficiency and flexibility. Conditional payments are more a wallet question. But it’s not a huge leap to imagine a deposit token that includes a snippet of code that triggers a function, such as access to a bid or payment of a dividend.  This sounds very cool, but it changes the characteristics of the deposit tokens to something more than mere money representation. If a token can become something else, is it still money? Does it satisfy the “singleness” requirement? Does it comply with the establishment definition criteria of medium of exchange, store of value and unit of account?  My hope is that the conundrums presented by the eruption of a new type of transfer technology into the powerful yet limited reach of “old school” monetary economics will open more eyes to the need to update definitions and concepts.  As things stand, regulators are held back by a blinkered adherence to past understanding, refusing to accept that new technologies require new ways of thinking. By limiting “acceptable” uses to things we can already do, authorities are blocking real innovation from helping to both cement and improve on progress.  This brings to mind a quote attributed to Stanford Professor Paul Saffo: “We tend to use a new technology to do an old task more efficiently. We pave the cow paths.”  Surely we can do better, but the first step will be to recognize that the new flying cows no longer need paths, existing definitions of money are unnecessarily limited, and regulators that stand in the way of progress become increasingly irrelevant.

33428736,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640917,1725985824,Ethereum In 3 Months: Legendary Analyst Reveals Prediction For December,"Much like Bitcoin (BTC), the price of Ethereum (ETH) has been trading significantly sideways lately. Due to this downtrend, a legendary crypto analyst has offered some insights into Ethereum’s price movements, predicting that in the next three months, the pioneer altcoin could see its price hit a bottom. Ethereum To Hit Price Bottom By December Benjamin Cowen, the founder of ITC Crypto and a prominent crypto analyst, has published a YouTube video discussing Ethereum’s price movements, highlighting a potential correlation between ETH’s price declines with the rising United States (US) unemployment rates. Related Reading: Ethereum Forms Falling Wedge Pattern That Could Send Price To $3,000 Historically, the rate of unemployment within the US tends to peak in the month of December, and Ethereum has experienced a price bottom during the same month in both 2016, and 2019. With the unemployment rate currently rising in the US, Cowen suggests that a continuation of this economic trend could lead to a peak in December 2024, potentially coinciding with a price bottom for Ethereum. For the past few months, the price of Ethereum has been on an unusual downward trend, crashing by over 20% earlier this year and dipping below $3,000. The cryptocurrency had mirrored Bitcoin’s price declines, bleeding red almost immediately after the broader market turned bearish. Despite the launch of Spot Ethereum Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), ETH has failed to gain enough momentum to propel its price to previous highs. Considering the cryptocurrency’s extensive decline trend, Cowen predicts that Ethereum could witness a 50% decline soon. Although the analyst did concede that the projected decline might not be as severe as a 50% drop, he remains convinced that some degree of decline, even if mild, is probable. As a result, Cowen has set a new target for Etheruem’s price by December, predicting that the pioneer cryptocurrency could see its price dropping to $1,200 from its current value. While drawing parallels between Etheruem’s price actions in 2019 and 2024, Cowen further suggested in an X (formerly Twitter) post that ETH might temporarily fall below its recently formed a wedge pattern before finding a price bottom. The analyst believes that after Ethereum hits its price bottom, the cryptocurrency could be on the road to a significant price recovery. As of writing, CoinMarketCap’s data reveals that Ethereum’s price is trading at $2,354, reflecting a slight uptick of 1.26% in the last 24 hours. Selling Pressures Increase For ETH Amidst price declines and broader market volatility, Ethereum has also been experiencing an increase in selling pressures. On September 10, Lookonchain reported that MetaAlpha, a hedging and trading service company, had executed another major transaction in a deposit of 10,000 ETH tokens valued at $23.45 million. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Dogecoin Will Rise 3,600% To $3.7, Here’s When Over the past four days, the company has moved a total of $33,589 ETH, worth about $77.55 million, to the Binance crypto exchange in the past four days.

42407701,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga0xJL,1725984449,Trump-Harris Debate: Polymarket Shows Slim Odds of Crypto Mention,"Cryptocurrency has come a long way. Once obscure, the technology now has a shot at being mentioned in Tuesday night's U.S. presidential debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris.  A long shot, but still a shot.  On Polymarket's ""What will Trump say at the debate?"" contract, ""yes"" shares for ""crypto/Bitcoin"" were trading at 17 cents midday Tuesday in New York, indicating traders see a 17% chance he will say one or both words. Each share pays out $1 worth of cryptocurrency if the prediction turns out to be correct, and nothing if it is proven wrong.  Crypto trails behind hot-button issues the former commander-in-chief and Republican nominee is likelier to utter, such as ""abortion"" (the highest probability, at 83%) as well as Trumpian epithets like ""Comrade Kamala"" (40%).  Vice President Harris, meanwhile, has an even slimmer chance of mentioning bitcoin or crypto, at 13%. Once again, ""abortion"" is the leading contender for a mention from the Democratic candidate (an 87% probability), followed by the description of her opponent as a ""convicted felon"" (58%).  Trump has aggressively courted crypto voters and donations this year. Harris' campaign has made overtures, although the vice president serves in an administration the industry considers hostile.  Latest News: Harris Won U.S. Presidential Debate Versus Trump, Polymarket Betting Suggests  Prediction markets allow traders to bet money on the outcomes of everything from flu outbreaks and wars to Rotten Tomatoes scores. Detractors say they amount to little more than gambling, but proponents say prediction markets offer a superior source of forecasting to polls and pundits. Because the traders making predictions are putting money on the line, they have a powerful incentive to thoroughly research topics and voice their honest conclusions, not what other people want to hear, the argument goes.  Election betting has surged this year and Polymarket has captured most of the action despite a regulatory settlement that requires it to block users from the U.S. (though some traders could be using VPNs to disguise their locations). Friday was the platform's biggest day ever, with $34 million in trading volume, according to Dune Analytics data.  On Manifold, a self-described ""play money"" prediction market, ""bitcoin"" ranks near the bottom of words or phrases likely to be said during Tuesday's debate, with 12% odds, slightly ahead of ""unburdened"" (8%) and ""coconut"" (6%). Bets on this market are paid out in mana, a digital (not crypto) currency. New users get free mana when they sign up and can buy more, but they can't cash it out; the main incentive to place bets on Manifold is to build a reputation as an accurate forecaster.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | RESEARCH,Marc Hochstein,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/09/10/trump-harris-debate-polymarket-shows-slim-odds-of-crypto-mention,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/59f48880b6b32dc2d94ca76dbefebf54b214c275-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Joining Mpeppe (MPEPE) and Aave (AAVE), Uniswap (UNI)’s newfound momentum is capturing the attention of investors across the crypto sphere. Let’s dive into why these three altcoins are making headlines and why they should be on every investor’s radar. Uniswap (UNI)’s Recent Victory: A Game-Changer for Decentralized Exchanges Uniswap (UNI), a trailblazer in decentralized exchanges, recently reached a settlement that has paved the way for its resurgence in the altcoin market. This development has catapulted UNI into the spotlight, with trading volumes surging and investor sentiment turning bullish. Uniswap (UNI)’s Core Strengths: Why Investors Are Bullish Uniswap (UNI)’s decentralized nature and high liquidity have always made it a preferred choice for crypto traders. With the recent settlement, UNI’s credibility and user confidence have skyrocketed, pushing it into the top three altcoins, where it now sits alongside Mpeppe (MPEPE) and Aave (AAVE). Mpeppe (MPEPE): The Meme Coin That’s Turning Heads While Uniswap (UNI) dominates decentralized exchanges, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is grabbing attention in the meme coin space. Known for its fusion of sports, meme culture, and blockchain innovation, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has created a unique niche by combining meme appeal with real-world use cases, particularly in the gambling and betting ecosystem. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s Real-World Utility Sets It Apart What makes Mpeppe (MPEPE) stand out from other meme coins is its utility. Users can stake MPEPE tokens within De-Fi liquidity pools and generate profits through the gaming and sports betting platform. This blend of meme culture and actual utility is driving Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s rapid rise in the market, securing its spot as one of the top three altcoins. Aave (AAVE): The DeFi Giant Maintains Its Place Among the Elite Aave (AAVE) a well-established leader in decentralized finance (DeFi), continues to hold its ground as one of the top altcoins. Aave (AAVE)’s ability to offer users decentralized lending and borrowing services without intermediaries has made it a staple in the DeFi ecosystem. Why Aave (AAVE) Remains a Top Contender With its innovative lending protocols, Aave (AAVE) allows users to borrow and lend crypto assets while earning interest. This has attracted a large user base, making Aave (AAVE) a trusted DeFi platform. As Aave (AAVE) solidifies its position, its influence in the crypto space shows no signs of waning. Why Uniswap (UNI), Mpeppe (MPEPE), and Aave (AAVE) Are Dominating the Altcoin Space Uniswap (UNI), Mpeppe (MPEPE), and Aave (AAVE) are top altcoins with unique strengths in decentralized trading, lending, meme coins, and gaming. Uniswap (UNI) is a decentralized exchange titan with a stable and efficient model, making it a top choice for investors. Mpeppe (MPEPE), a meme coin with real-world utility, combines meme culture and blockchain technology, particularly in the gambling sector, attracting more investors. Aave (AAVE), a DeFi powerhouse, offers decentralized lending and borrowing, attracting new users while maintaining its strong DeFi community. Conclusion: Uniswap (UNI), Mpeppe (MPEPE), and Aave (AAVE)—A Trio of Altcoin Powerhouses In the world of altcoins, Uniswap (UNI), Mpeppe (MPEPE), and Aave (AAVE) are emerging as top contenders, each bringing its unique advantages to the table. From Uniswap (UNI)’s dominance in decentralized exchanges and Aave (AAVE)’s DeFi innovations to Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s creative take on meme coins with real-world utility, these three cryptocurrencies are well-positioned to deliver significant returns for investors in 2024.

The news could signal a renewed interest from traditional payment platforms in cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies.  According to a press release shared with CoinDesk, users can now use their ENS names when transferring crypto on those platforms, allowing them to reduce the risk of transferring their assets to the wrong crypto addresses. The integration will first be available to users in the U.S.  ENS provides Ethereum users a name, like “xyz.eth,” instead of the long alphanumeric blockchain address associated with their crypto wallets, aiming to make the user experience of sending cryptocurrencies more seamless.  With the integration, PayPal and Venmo users will be able to enter a user’s ENS address when transferring crypto, and both payment platforms will be able to identify the wallet address associated with the ENS name.  “We are excited to bring ENS’ naming capabilities directly into the hands of millions of users, through Venmo, PayPal Mobile, and PayPal Web,” said Khori Whittaker, executive director of ENS Labs, in the press release. “As the world of digital assets becomes more mainstream, our goal is to ensure managing those assets is as intuitive and user-friendly as possible.”  Read more: Ethereum-Based Domain Protocol ENS Seeks Own L2, Possibly With ZK Rollups",POSITIVE,ENS,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | SPONSORED | ENS | ZK,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/09/10/paypal-venmo-to-accept-enss-human-readable-blockchain-names,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6ae68b29527970f686dd4f88c479c641c420137f-960x540.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin mining still dominated by larger mining pools, with FoundryUSA and Antpool representing more than 50% of the total hash rate.  A solo bitcoin {{BTC}} miner beat a swathe of powerful mining pools to receive a $181,000 reward after successfully mining block 860749 on Tuesday.  Bitcoin blocks are produced roughly every 10 minutes and are typically mined by mining pools, which combine computing power to give them the best possible chance of pocketing the block reward. The reward to successfully mine a block sits currently at 3.125 bitcoin, after a recent halving event earlier this year.  Solo miners usually have historically had limited computing power to mine blocks, although new solo mining rigs like BitAxe claim to offer 500 Giga Hashes per second (GH/s). Still, a solo miner winning a block could be compared to winning a lottery, given that the network's hashrate and difficulty are currently at all-time highs and institutional miners with immense computing power are also competing for the same block rewards.  ""It is not a rare occurrence that a solo miner finds a block, it is just a low probability event,"" CryptoQuant's head of research Julio Moreno told CoinDesk. ""However, this has been happening a little bit more frequent as there has been a growth in the production of small ASICs (mining equipment), which is specifically targeted to people that want to mine by their own from their own home.""  ""Still, the mining pool space remains highly concentrated, with two pools, FoundryUSA and Antpool, adding up to 53% of the total Bitcoin network hashrate,"" Moreno added.  According to Hashrate Index, Foundry USA currently has a reported hash rate of 202.8 exahashes per second (EH/s), and AntPool has a figure of 160.3 EH/s. An exahash is a metric that is one billion times greater than a gigahash.

The newly licensed firm said it'll start launching products under its new status early next year.  A second company, tZero Group Inc., said it's achieved status as a fully registered U.S. broker dealer under a rule allowing for crypto firms to join those ranks, following a path previously blazed by Prometheum Inc.  Such a registration as a special purpose broker dealer under U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission oversight will allow the firm to take custody of customers' digital assets securities, though that ability bumps right into the industry's widespread legal battle with the SEC over the regulator's stance that most crypto tokens are securities. To take custody of crypto securities, tZERO and Prometheum must treat tokens as securities while the industry (including many issuers) is pushing back on that label.  ""Our special purpose broker-dealer status will enable us to offer safe, secure and regulated broker-dealer digital asset custody and other new and innovative products for issuers, investors and other market participants alike,"" said tZero CEO David Goone, in a statement.  The company – backed by Overstock and New York Stock Exchange parent Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) – said that as soon as early next year, it'll start opening services for assets including private securities, securitized real estate, art and sports assets. It'll start with the ""full digitization of tZERO's Series-A preferred equity security,"" TZROP, the company said.  The firm had previously registered a trading platform, known as an alternative trading system (ATS), so the addition of the new license will allow custody, clearance and settlement under one umbrella, it said.  Read More: TZero to Sunset tZero Crypto App Amid Regulatory Challenges  An SEC spokesman declined comment on or confirm tZero's new status.

Bernstein said legacy data centers can provide equivalent scale, but not in the same timeframe.  The broker has an outperform rating on Core Scientific with a $17 price target.  Core Scientific (CORZ), the bitcoin {{BTC}} miner that in June signed a 200 megawatts (MW) artificial intelligence (AI) deal with CoreWeave, is uniquely positioned to deliver as much as 300 megawatts of scale within three years, broker Bernstein said in a research report on Tuesday following a conversation with CEO Adam Sullivan.  The company benefits from ""readily available sites and power, less competition in the 1-3 year timeframe data center market, and ability to build and hire a strong data center talent bench,"" analysts led by Gautam Chhugani wrote.  Legacy data centers can provide the same scale, but need more time to get there, the report noted. ""For CoreWeave, in the AI arms race, execution speed and time to market is most critical,"" the authors wrote.  AI companies' rapid growth in demand for computer power has left them with a problem. While investor money is pouring in, they don't have fast enough access to the infrastructure needed to power the ever-growing computing needs. Bitcoin miners do, with access to readily available sites and power. Core Scientific's 12-year deal with CoreWeave is evidence of a growing trend of AI firms partnering with bitcoin miners.  The broker noted that some investors have voiced concerns about Core Scientific's counterparty risk with CoreWeave because of the deal, and the risks of a debt-fueled overbuild.  ""These are obviously much broader risks in the AI cycle and investment in CORZ involves underwriting CoreWeave,"" the report said.  Bernstein has an outperform rating on Core Scientific's stock with a $17 price target. The stock was trading little changed at around $10 at publication time.  Private equity firms are seeing value in partnering with bitcoin miners to help with AI computing after Core inked its CoreWeave deal, the company's CEO told CoinDesk in an exclusive interview.

33425966,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641011,1725980445,Uniswap (UNI) Community Sentiment Grows As Price Surge New ICO Gains Momentum Ahead of Uniswap (UNI) Launch,"The Uniswap (UNI) community is buzzing with excitement as Mpeppe (MPEPE) prepares for its highly anticipated launch on the decentralized exchange. With the growing momentum behind Mpeppe (MPEPE), many investors are eager to see how the coin will perform once it becomes available on Uniswap (UNI). Here’s a closer look at why this new ICO is capturing attention and how the Uniswap (UNI) community is preparing for the next big thing in meme coins. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s ERC20 Compatibility: Seamless Integration with Ethereum As an ERC20 token, Mpeppe (MPEPE) benefits from the robust infrastructure of the Ethereum blockchain. This compatibility ensures seamless integration with a variety of Ethereum wallets and decentralized applications, including Uniswap (UNI). By leveraging Ethereum’s established blockchain ecosystem, MPEPE offers users ease of access, making it simple for investors to trade, store, and utilize the token. This integration is crucial as it sets Mpeppe (MPEPE) up for widespread adoption as soon as it launches on Uniswap (UNI). Why ERC20 Compatibility Matters for Investors ERC20 tokens are the backbone of many decentralized applications, and Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s adoption of this standard ensures that it can capitalize on Ethereum’s liquidity pools and smart contract capabilities. This feature allows for smooth transactions and efficient token swapping, especially on Uniswap (UNI). Uniswap (UNI)’s Role in Amplifying Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s Exposure As one of the largest decentralized exchanges, Uniswap (UNI) plays a pivotal role in bringing promising tokens like Mpeppe (MPEPE) to a broader audience. With over $1 billion in daily trading volume, Uniswap (UNI)’s platform provides Mpeppe (MPEPE) with the liquidity and exposure needed to attract both retail and institutional investors. The Uniswap (UNI) listing is expected to trigger a significant price surge as MPEPE becomes available to a wider pool of traders. The Power of Uniswap (UNI)’s Liquidity Pools Uniswap (UNI)’s automated market maker (AMM) model allows users to provide liquidity in exchange for rewards. As Mpeppe (MPEPE) gains momentum, liquidity pools for MPEPE on Uniswap (UNI) will expand, leading to enhanced price stability and trading opportunities. This will further drive interest from DeFi enthusiasts who are always on the lookout for the next potential gem. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s Low Initial Price: A Gateway for Mass Adoption Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s initial price of $0.00077 USD makes it an attractive investment option for both novice and seasoned investors. With a total supply of 7.6 billion tokens, MPEPE is strategically positioned to be accessible and affordable, enabling mass adoption across the cryptocurrency community. The combination of low entry cost and strong community engagement makes Mpeppe (MPEPE) a potential winner as it launches on Uniswap (UNI). Why Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s Pricing Strategy Could Lead to Explosive Growth Many early adopters are drawn to tokens with low entry points, and Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers exactly that. As the token prepares for its Uniswap (UNI) debut, its attractive price could trigger FOMO (fear of missing out) among investors looking to capitalize on potential gains. If the demand spikes post-launch, the price of MPEPE could skyrocket, rewarding those who got in early. Conclusion: Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s Uniswap (UNI) Launch Marks a Turning Point With its ERC20 compatibility, strategic pricing, and upcoming Uniswap (UNI) listing, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is poised for a breakout. The combination of meme coin appeal and real-world utility in gaming and betting gives it a unique edge in the market. As the Uniswap (UNI) community eagerly awaits the token’s launch, MPEPE is set to capture significant attention, making it one of the top coins to watch in the coming weeks. Whether you’re a seasoned DeFi investor or new to meme coins, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a compelling opportunity for growth and adoption.

Mpeppe (MPEPE), a hybrid meme token with a robust DeFi integration, is rapidly expanding its investor base. With Ethereum (ETH)’s struggles in the market, many are looking at Mpeppe (MPEPE) as the next big opportunity. Ethereum (ETH)’s Stagnation: Why $2700 Seems Out of Reach Ethereum (ETH) has been under pressure for weeks, unable to reclaim its $2700 price point. Factors such as network congestion, high gas fees, and market uncertainty have contributed to ETH’s recent performance woes. This has led investors to explore alternative projects like Mpeppe (MPEPE), which offers innovation and growth potential. Mpeppe (MPEPE): Why Investors Are Flocking to This Meme Coin While Ethereum (ETH) faces challenges, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has become a favorite among both retail and institutional investors. What sets Mpeppe (MPEPE) apart from other meme coins is its seamless integration with decentralized finance (DeFi), offering features like yield farming, liquidity mining, and decentralized governance mechanisms. These utilities are drawing a diverse group of investors who seek both fun and profitability in their portfolios. DeFi and Mpeppe (MPEPE): The Perfect Synergy Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s DeFi integration is one of the key reasons for its growing popularity. The token allows users to stake their MPEPE coins in liquidity pools to earn rewards, bringing DeFi benefits to the meme coin space. This blend of decentralized finance with the viral nature of meme coins has created a unique ecosystem that attracts a broad spectrum of crypto enthusiasts. Yield Farming and Liquidity Mining: Expanding Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s Use Case While Ethereum (ETH) struggles with high transaction costs, Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s DeFi solutions offer users a more cost-effective alternative. Through yield farming and liquidity mining, investors can maximize their returns by staking Mpeppe (MPEPE) tokens.

Ethereum (ETH)’s Challenges: Will ETH Recover? Ethereum (ETH) has a history of overcoming obstacles, but its recent performance has left many wondering whether ETH will return to its former glory.

33425965,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640906,1725980407,"Dogecoin Rejected At $0.09149, Heading For Key Trendline Support","Dogecoin (DOGE) is once again at a critical juncture after facing rejection at the $0.09149 level. This pullback has pushed the price toward a key trendline, putting the cryptocurrency in a decisive position. As Dogecoin tests this crucial support, market watchers are eager to see if the bulls can regroup and trigger a breakout. A successful move above the trendline could open the door for a renewed rally, but failure to hold this level might lead to further downside pressure. This analysis aims to explore Dogecoin’s current price action following its rejection at the $0.09149 level, which has driven the cryptocurrency back to a critical trendline. By examining key technical indicators and market sentiment, we aim to assess whether the bulls have the potential to ignite a breakout above this trendline or if bearish forces will continue to dominate, pushing the price further down. Bullish Or Bearish? Analyzing Market Sentiment On DOGE On the 4-hour chart, following the rejection at $0.09149, Dogecoin has gained momentum, recently crossing above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and approaching the bearish trendline. The price action suggests growing positive pressure and market sentiment, which could pave the way for a potential breakout if the trendline is breached. Also, the Composite Trend Oscillator on the 4-hour chart suggests that bullish momentum is increasing and that a potential breakout above the bearish trendline could be on the horizon as both the signal line and the RSI line of the indicator have moved above the zero mark. Related Reading: Bullish Alert For Dogecoin: TD Indicator Flashes Buy Signal As $0.10 Target Looms On the 1-day chart, Dogecoin is showing increasing upward momentum as it seeks to break above the bearish trendline and approach the 100-day simple moving average. Specifically, the positive movement reflects growing market optimism, suggesting that if DOGE successfully surpasses the trendline, it could lead to more gains. Finally, on the 1-day chart, the signal line has crossed above the SMA line of the composite trend oscillator, and both are moving out of the oversold zone toward the zero line. This implies that momentum is shifting positively, indicating a potential recovery and strengthening bullish outlook as the indicator seeks to exit the oversold conditions. Key Trendline In Focus: Will Dogecoin Hold Or Fold? If Dogecoin can break through and hold above this trendline, it may signal a bullish continuation, potentially leading to gains toward $0.1293. A successful breach of this level could pave the way for further increases, with the price possibly testing the $0.1491 mark and exploring even higher resistance zones. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price (DOGE) Slips Into the Red: Key Hurdles to Watch However, should Dogecoin fail to maintain its position above this level, it might drop to the $0.09149 support range. A break below this support could lead to additional declines, with the price potentially testing the $0.07456 mark and reaching other lower support ranges. Dogecoin, with a market capitalization of over $15 billion and a trading volume exceeding $659 million, was trading around $0.103, marking a 6.49% rise at the time of writing. In the past 24 hours, its market cap has surged by 6.50%, while trading volume has skyrocketed by 52.84%, reflecting renewed interest and bullish momentum in the market.

Quant (QNT)’s Recent Surge: A Sign of Strength? Quant (QNT)’s impressive trading volume increase points to renewed confidence in the project, particularly its role in blockchain interoperability.

33424228,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640992,1725976856,"3 Reasons SUI Investors Are Joining Mpeppe Casino, Top Analyst Explains SUI & Mpeppe Future Utility and Impact On Cryptocurrency Market","As the cryptocurrency market evolves, two altcoins are gaining the attention of investors looking for the next big opportunity: Sui (SUI) and Mpeppe (MPEPE). While Sui (SUI) has recently surged in value, thanks in part to the launch of its AUSD stablecoin, Mpeppe is making waves as a new casino cryptocurrency. Both of these digital assets are rapidly developing their ecosystems, and investors are taking notice. In this article, we’ll explore three key reasons why Sui (SUI) investors are diversifying their portfolios by adding Mpeppe, and how both tokens are poised to impact the broader cryptocurrency market. 1. SUI’s AUSD Stablecoin Boosts Liquidity and DeFi Activity One of the driving factors behind Sui’s (SUI) recent performance is the launch of its native stablecoin, AUSD. Developed in partnership with Nonstop Finance, AUSD is designed to enhance decentralized finance (DeFi) operations on the Sui (SUI) network. By providing a stable and decentralized asset for transactions, borrowing, and lending, AUSD strengthens the liquidity within the Sui (SUI) ecosystem, making it more attractive to investors. Sui (SUI)’s Total Value Locked (TVL) surged to $641 million following the AUSD launch, signaling growing confidence in the project. As liquidity continues to increase, the price of Sui (SUI) has shown bullish momentum, recently rebounding from $0.80 and pushing toward the $1 resistance level. With Sui (SUI)’s price action forming an inverted head-and-shoulders pattern on the charts, analysts expect a potential breakout that could take Sui (SUI) beyond the $1 mark and target $1.43 and $1.72 in the coming weeks. This bullish outlook has led Sui (SUI) investors to explore other promising opportunities within the cryptocurrency space, with Mpeppe emerging as a top contender. 2. Mpeppe’s Low Price and Unique Casino Utility Appeal to SUI Investors While Sui (SUI) investors are riding the wave of positive momentum, many are also diversifying their portfolios by adding Mpeppe (MPEPE), a mobile gaming and casino-focused cryptocurrency. Priced at just $0.0021 per token, Mpeppe (MPEPE) presents an attractive investment opportunity for those looking to maximize potential returns. Mpeppe (MPEPE) is more than just a typical memecoin. Its integration into the booming play-to-earn and mobile gaming sectors makes it a unique player in the market. The Mpeppe (MPEPE) Casino offers users the chance to engage in a range of games while earning cryptocurrency rewards. This real-world utility is drawing the attention of Sui (SUI) investors who are looking for projects that combine entertainment with financial growth. The current Mpeppe (MPEPE) presale has already sold over 71% of its tokens, raising more than $2.16 million. Investors are rushing to secure their place in the project as the price is expected to increase in the next stage of the presale. With Mpeppe (MPEPE) showing significant growth potential, it’s no surprise that Sui (SUI) holders are adding it to their long-term investments. 3. The Growing Potential of SUI and Mpeppe in the DeFi and Gaming Sectors The rise of Sui (SUI) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) highlights the growing importance of decentralized finance and gaming within the cryptocurrency market. Both tokens are carving out niches that cater to the rapidly expanding DeFi and mobile gaming industries. For Sui (SUI), the launch of AUSD has enhanced its position in the DeFi space, attracting liquidity and driving up its TVL. The token’s ability to break past key resistance levels will be crucial in determining its future trajectory, and the potential for a breakout could bring significant gains for holders. Mpeppe (MPEPE), on the other hand, is focusing on the mobile gaming sector, offering users an immersive casino experience where they can earn rewards in cryptocurrency. The play-to-earn model is becoming increasingly popular, and Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s innovative approach to integrating gaming with crypto offers a unique value proposition. As both tokens continue to develop their ecosystems, they are well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for DeFi solutions and gaming platforms. For Sui (SUI) investors, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers an opportunity to diversify their holdings and gain exposure to the exciting world of mobile gaming, all while benefiting from the potential for high returns. Conclusion: SUI and Mpeppe’s Future Impact on the Cryptocurrency Market As Sui (SUI) gears up for a potential breakout past $1, driven by the success of its AUSD stablecoin and increasing liquidity, investors are also turning their attention to Mpeppe (MPEPE) as a promising investment opportunity in the mobile gaming space. Both tokens have significant potential to shape the future of the cryptocurrency market, with Sui (SUI) strengthening its foothold in DeFi and Mpeppe (MPEPE) offering a fresh perspective on the play-to-earn model. For investors looking to capitalize on emerging trends, both Sui (SUI) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) provide exciting opportunities for growth. Whether through DeFi or mobile gaming, these two tokens are poised to make a lasting impact on the market, and their future utility could bring substantial returns for those who get in early. With Mpeppe (MPEPE) currently in its presale stage and Sui (SUI) approaching a critical resistance level, now may be the perfect time for investors to explore both of these projects and add them to their portfolios.

33424225,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640994,1725976851,Ethereum Investors Seek Refuge In Starknet (STRK) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) as They Show Dominance Current Market Sentiment,"Ethereum (ETH) investors are increasingly looking for alternative investments that offer growth potential. Two projects that have stood out during this period are Mpeppe (MPEPE) and Starknet (STRK). Both of these tokens have managed to dominate the current market sentiment, giving Ethereum investors a sense of refuge amid volatility. Why Ethereum Investors Are Eyeing Mpeppe (MPEPE) and Starknet (STRK) With Ethereum’s scalability issues and high gas fees, many investors are searching for emerging projects that offer innovative solutions and market advantages. Starknet (STRK), a Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum, has been gaining attention for its ability to significantly reduce gas fees while maintaining network security. Meanwhile, Mpeppe (MPEPE), a meme-based cryptocurrency with a casino and DeFi ecosystem, has captured investor interest through its blend of humor and real-world utility. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s Viral Success and Why It’s Attracting Investors Mpeppe (MPEPE) has proven that meme coins are more than just internet jokes; they can be serious investment opportunities. Built on the viral nature of memes, Mpeppe (MPEPE) capitalizes on its light-hearted branding while offering real value through its casino and gaming ecosystem. This combination of meme culture and DeFi protocols has positioned Mpeppe (MPEPE) as a favorite among younger investors looking to tap into both entertainment and profit. Expanding the Meme Coin Audience By leveraging the viral power of internet culture, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is rapidly expanding its user base. Its accessible and relatable branding appeals to a wider demographic, allowing it to reach not just crypto enthusiasts, but casual investors too. Integrating DeFi for Greater Utility Mpeppe (MPEPE) isn’t just about memes; it’s about creating wealth through strategic planning. With features like yield farming, liquidity mining, and NFT-based rewards, Mpeppe (MPEPE) allows users to engage with its platform in meaningful ways, giving the token a competitive edge in the meme coin market. Starknet (STRK)’s Role in Solving Ethereum’s Scalability Problems As Ethereum faces scalability issues, Starknet (STRK) has emerged as a promising solution. By enabling Ethereum transactions to be processed off-chain and then settled back on-chain, Starknet (STRK) significantly reduces transaction fees while improving throughput. For Ethereum investors, this scalability solution makes Starknet (STRK) an attractive choice, as it addresses one of Ethereum’s most pressing challenges. Layer-2 Solutions Leading the Way As more Layer-2 solutions like Starknet (STRK) gain traction, investors are starting to see them as the future of Ethereum’s scalability. Starknet (STRK)’s ability to facilitate faster and cheaper transactions is particularly appealing to institutional and retail investors alike. Integration with Ethereum’s Ecosystem What makes Starknet (STRK) especially appealing is its compatibility with Ethereum’s existing ecosystem. Developers can easily migrate dApps from Ethereum to Starknet (STRK), allowing the network to benefit from Ethereum’s security while offering more efficient performance. Conclusion: Mpeppe (MPEPE) and Starknet (STRK) as Dominant Forces in the Crypto Market As Ethereum investors look for alternatives in an increasingly competitive market, both Mpeppe (MPEPE) and Starknet (STRK) have emerged as dominant players. While Starknet (STRK) offers solutions to Ethereum’s scalability issues, Mpeppe (MPEPE) combines meme culture with real-world utility, making it a unique investment opportunity.

33424223,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641000,1725976849,"Helium Ecosystem Sparks An 8% Price Surge Over Past Week, Mpeppe (MPEPE) Still Investors Favorite For 150x Profits","The cryptocurrency market is constantly shifting, and while some tokens experience impressive price surges, others capture the hearts of investors with their long-term potential. Recently, Helium (HNT) witnessed an 8% price surge, drawing attention from market participants. However, Mpeppe (MPEPE) remains the top pick for those seeking massive 150x returns. Let’s dive into why these two tokens are attracting significant interest. Helium (HNT) Experiences Impressive Price Surge Helium (HNT)’s ecosystem has seen a substantial boost recently, with an 8% price increase over the past week. This spike is driven by a combination of factors, including network expansion and strategic partnerships that have strengthened its infrastructure. What’s Driving Helium’s Growth? The expansion of the Helium (HNT) IoT network has played a crucial role in driving its price upward. The project’s focus on decentralizing wireless networks for IoT devices has gained substantial traction, increasing its utility and attracting investor attention. More companies are integrating Helium (HNT)’s decentralized infrastructure, which has further enhanced its demand. While Helium (HNT) benefits from these developments, many investors believe that Mpeppe (MPEPE), with its meme appeal and real-world utility, may offer even greater growth potential. Why Mpeppe (MPEPE) Remains Investors’ Favorite for 150x Profits Although Helium (HNT) has enjoyed recent growth, Mpeppe (MPEPE) continues to capture investor attention due to its massive potential for returns. Positioned as both a meme cryptocurrency and a utility token for the gaming and sports betting ecosystem, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers unique opportunities for exponential growth. The Power of Meme Culture and Real-World Utility Mpeppe (MPEPE) has successfully merged meme culture with the fast-growing decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape. Unlike many other meme coins that rely on hype alone, Mpeppe (MPEPE) provides real financial functionality, making it attractive to a wide range of investors. This combination of viral meme power and real-world utility has led many to believe that Mpeppe (MPEPE) can achieve impressive returns. Through its integration with De-Fi protocols, Mpeppe (MPEPE) enables users to participate in activities such as yield farming, liquidity mining, and decentralized governance. This adds significant value to the project, positioning it as a serious contender in the cryptocurrency space. Additionally, its appeal to the younger, tech-savvy demographic has expanded its reach, allowing Mpeppe (MPEPE) to build a strong, engaged community. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s Vision of Community Wealth Creation At the core of Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s success is its commitment to fostering a community that promotes creativity, drives positive change, and creates wealth through strategic planning. Inspired by meme culture and professional soccer player Mbappé, Mpeppe (MPEPE) transcends the traditional meme coin model by offering real-world utility. By combining sports passion with blockchain innovation, Mpeppe (MPEPE) creates a space where community members can socialize, trade the community token, and engage in exciting sports-related activities. This vision has captivated investors, making Mpeppe (MPEPE) one of the most sought-after tokens in the market today. Comparing Helium (HNT) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) While both Helium (HNT) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) have experienced strong growth, they offer very different value propositions. Helium (HNT) focuses on creating a decentralized network for IoT devices, appealing to tech-driven investors looking for steady growth. On the other hand, Mpeppe (MPEPE) combines entertainment, sports, and decentralized finance to deliver a high-risk, high-reward opportunity for investors seeking rapid gains. For investors looking for long-term, steady growth, Helium (HNT) may be the better choice. However, those seeking explosive growth and the chance to capitalize on the power of meme culture should consider Mpeppe (MPEPE), which offers the potential for 150x returns. Final Thoughts: Helium’s Surge vs. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s Long-Term Potential Helium (HNT) is experiencing a temporary price surge, impressing investors with its expansion. However, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers exponential growth with its unique combination of meme culture, DeFi integration, and community. Mpeppe (MPEPE) stands out for its potential for massive returns in a short time, making it a favorite among investors.

Alongside Mpeppe (MPEPE), these tokens are gaining significant attention as must-watch investments for September. Let’s explore why Helium (HNT) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) are making waves in a volatile market. Helium (HNT) Defies Bearish Market Sentiment Helium (HNT) has consistently proven itself as a valuable asset, particularly in times of market downturns. While many cryptocurrencies are struggling to maintain momentum, HNT has managed to not only hold its value but also increase in price, making it one of the most resilient tokens in the current market. Helium (HNT)’s Unique IoT Network Grows Helium (HNT)’s decentralized wireless network, which allows users to create and manage IoT (Internet of Things) infrastructure, has been expanding steadily. This growth has translated into increasing demand for HNT, as more devices join the network and participate in data transmission. Real-World Utility Bolsters HNT’s Value Unlike many speculative assets, Helium (HNT) is backed by tangible utility. As more industries and consumers rely on decentralized networks for secure and low-cost data transmission, Helium (HNT)’s market presence strengthens, giving it a significant edge in the cryptocurrency space.

However, recent market trends suggest that Ethereum (ETH) is struggling to keep up with an altcoin rally, as holders of ETH turn to newer projects like Mpeppe (MPEPE) in search of higher returns. Mpeppe’s decentralized casino platform has seen a significant 121% surge, drawing attention from Ethereum (ETH) holders looking for diversification. Ethereum’s Struggle to Join the Altcoin Rally In the world of cryptocurrencies, Ethereum (ETH) has been a giant, but even giants stumble. After reaching record-high user numbers, Ethereum (ETH) has been facing a correction. ETH’s price has been stuck in a downward trend, despite recent positive developments in the ecosystem. According to data, Ethereum (ETH) saw a massive increase in new wallets being created, with over 126,000 new ETH wallets registered in a single day an indication of growing network utility. This surge in network growth is encouraging, but it hasn’t yet translated into a price recovery. Currently, Ethereum (ETH) is trading around the $2,200 to $2,300 range, and while the influx of new users is a positive sign, the market awaits more concrete price movements. This brings us to the question many ETH holders are asking: Is Ethereum (ETH) poised to break out of its current slump, or is it time to explore new opportunities, like Mpeppe (MPEPE), to achieve significant gains? The Rise of Mpeppe (MPEPE) While Ethereum (ETH) is facing challenges, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is capitalizing on the growing interest in decentralized finance (DeFi) and meme coins. Mpeppe, a decentralized casino platform built on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain, offers users a fun and transparent way to gamble while earning rewards through staking. The casino’s unique approach has driven its price up by 121%, and ETH holders are taking notice. Mpeppe (MPEPE) combines the excitement of meme coins with the utility of decentralized finance. The project has drawn attention from Ethereum investors due to its innovative use case and the transparency of its decentralized platform. As more ETH holders look for ways to diversify their portfolios, Mpeppe offers an attractive alternative, especially with its decentralized casino model, which provides both entertainment and the potential for financial gain. Ethereum’s On-Chain Activity Surge: Will Price Follow? Despite the recent struggles in ETH’s price, on-chain activity is surging. The increase in Ethereum wallet registrations to over 126,000 new wallets in a single day is a sign that investors are still engaging with the network. This increase in user numbers is the highest Ethereum has seen in four months and is happening at a time when Ethereum’s price is in a correction phase. While this surge in user activity is a positive indicator, Ethereum’s price remains tied to broader market factors. Many investors are waiting on key inflation data from the U.S. to see how it will impact the cryptocurrency market. Should inflation rates be lower than expected, it could provide the boost that Ethereum needs to break out of its current downtrend. However, the rising uncertainty around Ethereum’s price is leading many ETH holders to explore other investment opportunities. As Ethereum struggles to gain momentum, projects like Mpeppe (MPEPE) are becoming attractive alternatives for those looking to capitalize on more immediate gains. Why ETH Holders Are Adding Mpeppe to Their Portfolios For Ethereum (ETH) holders, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a unique opportunity to diversify their portfolios with a project that has shown significant growth potential. While Ethereum remains a stronghold in decentralized finance, Mpeppe’s decentralized casino adds an element of fun and financial utility that resonates with the meme coin crowd and DeFi enthusiasts alike. The combination of decentralized gambling and staking makes Mpeppe a compelling investment for those who want to earn passive income while enjoying the entertainment value of a casino. Furthermore, Mpeppe’s transparency ensures that all transactions and games are provably fair, which adds to its appeal for both casual gamblers and serious investors. Ethereum holders, many of whom are looking for ways to capitalize on the ongoing altcoin rally, are turning to Mpeppe as a way to hedge against the uncertainty surrounding ETH’s price. The rapid rise of Mpeppe (MPEPE) by 121% is a clear indication that there is strong demand for this decentralized casino platform, and early investors are positioning themselves to benefit from the upcoming Uniswap launch. Looking Ahead: Ethereum’s Recovery and Mpeppe’s Potential As Ethereum (ETH) continues to face challenges, its recovery will likely depend on broader market trends, such as the upcoming inflation data from the U.S. Federal Reserve. A favorable outcome could help ETH regain some of its lost value and potentially rejoin the altcoin rally. However, the uncertainty surrounding ETH’s price is causing many investors to explore new opportunities in the DeFi and meme coin space. Mpeppe (MPEPE) is uniquely positioned to benefit from this shift in investor sentiment. With its decentralized casino platform, Mpeppe offers both fun and financial rewards, making it an attractive option for Ethereum holders who are looking for the next big opportunity. As the market continues to evolve, both Ethereum and Mpeppe will play critical roles in shaping the future of decentralized finance. While Ethereum remains a cornerstone of the crypto ecosystem, Mpeppe is emerging as a strong contender for investors looking to diversify their portfolios and capitalize on the explosive growth potential of decentralized casinos. Conclusion Ethereum (ETH) may be struggling to join the current altcoin rally, but the surge in new users indicates that the network still holds significant potential. However, in the face of ETH’s price uncertainty, many holders are turning to new projects like Mpeppe (MPEPE) to diversify their investments and seek out high-growth opportunities. With Mpeppe’s decentralized casino platform gaining traction and its 121% surge in value, Ethereum (ETH) holders are finding a new way to capitalize on the excitement of decentralized finance. As both Ethereum (ETH) and Mpeppe navigate the challenges and opportunities ahead, investors are positioning themselves for success in this dynamic and rapidly changing market.

Addresses holding between 100 and 1,000 BTC now control 20.3% of the circulating supply, equivalent to 4.01 million BTC. This marks a 5% increase from 3.82 million BTC six months ago, highlighting growing accumulation by large holders pic.twitter.com/JwkxBgWmDS — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) September 8, 2024 The Rise Of Institutional Interest The world of cryptocurrency is changing, and right at the forefront of that change is institutional interest. It has just been shown in a recent Coinbase survey that nearly one-third of institutional respondents have increased their crypto holdings over the past year. Consequently, there is a surge in confidence: 64% of those already invested are expected to invest even more resources into cryptocurrencies in the next three years. This is the most important sentiment, because it means long-term commitment to digital assets and, especially, Bitcoin, which is still perceived as “digital gold.” Bitcoin: The Big Players Significantly, key financial giants such as Grayscale and BlackRock have been leaving no stone unturned in the crypto space. Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust saw billions invested into it, while BlackRock’s foray into Bitcoin ETFs simply legitimized the asset class. The greenlighting of spot Bitcoin ETFs by the US Securities and Exchange Commission has been a game-changer, with such funds gathering more than $25 billion in assets within one month of their launch. Such a surge of institutional money does not only tame volatility in the market but also greatly increases the credibility of Bitcoin as a mainstream form of investment. Related Reading: Ether Liquidity Plummets 40% On Exchanges After ETF Debut Corporate Strategies And Massive BTC Adoption While this is the case, and as the appeal of Bitcoin continues to rise, many companies have started rethinking their treasury strategies. According to River, a Bitcoin technology company, in about 1.5 years, an estimated 10% of US-based companies could invest about 1.5% of their cash reserves, approximately $10.35 billion, into Bitcoin. This hypothesis has been based on the premise that companies need to combat inflation and hunt for asset diversification. The future of Bitcoin is, therefore, bright and very attractive to corporate finance.

33422567,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640946,1725973236,3 Reason’s You Must Hold These Gaming Token BinaryX BNX and Mpeppe Casino,"The cryptocurrency market is constantly evolving, and gaming tokens are quickly rising to the top of investors’ portfolios. Two gaming tokens that have attracted significant attention recently are BinaryX (BNX) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) Casino. While the broader market has faced challenges, these two tokens have continued to show resilience, thanks to their strong fundamentals and growth potential within the GameFi space. In this article, we’ll explore why holding BNX and Mpeppe Casino could be a smart decision for investors looking for long-term gains. 1. BinaryX (BNX) and Its Dominance in the GameFi Ecosystem BinaryX (BNX) has solidified its position as a key player in the GameFi (Game Finance) sector, merging gaming and decentralized finance (DeFi). As the GameFi ecosystem expands, BinaryX (BNX) continues to attract attention from investors due to its innovative approach to combining gaming with blockchain technology. One of the major factors driving BNX’s growth is its recent decision to burn a significant portion of its total supply, reducing the overall token count and creating scarcity. This move has made BinaryX (BNX) more appealing to investors, as lower supply often leads to increased demand and higher prices. With a solid BEP-20 token structure and a successful audit from Certik, BinaryX (BNX) has built a foundation of trust and security, giving investors confidence in its long-term potential. The BinaryX (BNX) token also operates on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), which provides enhanced scalability and security for its gaming applications. This allows BinaryX (BNX) to continue developing within the GameFi space while attracting more players and investors to its platform. As GameFi becomes more mainstream, BNX is poised to benefit from the increasing popularity of blockchain-based games, making it a valuable asset in the portfolio of any serious investor. 2. Mpeppe Casino: The Next Big Thing in Play-to-Earn Gaming While BinaryX (BNX) has established itself in the GameFi space, Mpeppe (MPEPE) Casino offers an exciting new opportunity for investors. With its innovative play-to-earn casino gaming model, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has positioned itself as a token that merges the entertainment of mobile gaming with the financial potential of cryptocurrency. Mpeppe (MPEPE) Casino allows users to play a variety of casino games while earning cryptocurrency rewards, adding a real-world use case to the token. This unique concept has generated substantial interest during its presale, with 71% of tokens already sold and over $2 million raised. The growing popularity of mobile gaming, combined with the increasing demand for play-to-earn opportunities, makes Mpeppe (MPEPE) a strong contender in the gaming sector. Moreover, Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s potential for a 100X return has caught the attention of BNX investors looking to diversify their portfolios. By adding Mpeppe (MPEPE) to their holdings, BNX investors can capitalize on the massive growth potential of the gaming and cryptocurrency industries. With Mpeppe (MPEPE) priced at just $0.0021 during the presale, it represents a low-risk, high-reward investment for those who get in early. 3. Diversification and Long-Term Growth Potential One of the key reasons to hold both BinaryX (BNX) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) Casino is the diversification they offer within the broader gaming and cryptocurrency markets. While BinaryX (BNX) has already established itself as a major player in the GameFi ecosystem, Mpeppe (MPEPE) presents a new opportunity for investors to tap into the growing market for mobile gaming and play-to-earn casino games. Diversification is crucial in the volatile world of cryptocurrency, and holding multiple tokens across different sectors can help reduce risk while maximizing potential gains. By investing in both BNX and Mpeppe (MPEPE), investors can benefit from the rapid growth of the gaming industry, which is expected to continue expanding in the coming years. Furthermore, both tokens have strong fundamentals and unique value propositions that set them apart from other cryptocurrencies. BinaryX (BNX)’s solid foundation in GameFi and Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s innovative casino gaming model provide a strong case for their long-term growth potential. As more investors recognize the value of these tokens, their prices are likely to rise, offering significant returns for those who hold onto them. Conclusion BinaryX (BNX) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) Casino are two gaming tokens that offer exciting opportunities for investors looking to capitalize on the growth of the GameFi and play-to-earn sectors. BNX’s dominance in the GameFi space and its recent token burn make it a solid long-term investment, while Mpeppe’s (MPEPE) innovative casino gaming model offers the potential for massive returns. By holding both tokens, investors can diversify their portfolios and position themselves to benefit from the continued expansion of the gaming industry. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or new to the cryptocurrency market, BNX and Mpeppe (MPEPE) are two tokens worth adding to your portfolio for long-term success.

Both projects are showing great potential, with Starknet (STRK) making impressive strides in Layer 2 scaling solutions and Mpeppe revolutionizing decentralized casino gaming. As the crypto market shifts, support from ETH whales could push these tokens to new highs, offering substantial returns to early adopters. Starknet (STRK): Breaking Through with Ethereum’s Layer 2 Power Starknet (STRK) has positioned itself as one of the most promising Layer 2 solutions on the Ethereum (ETH) network, addressing the scalability issues that have long plagued the blockchain. STRK, the native token of Starknet (STRK), recently saw a surge in value, driven by a 22% increase over the past week. This rally caught the attention of Ethereum (ETH) co-founder Vitalik Buterin, who transferred 2 million STRK tokens to a new wallet. The move sparked a wave of investor interest, pushing the STRK price from $0.40 to $0.43. Technical analysis shows that Starknet (STRK) has broken through its descending trendline, a positive indicator for further upward momentum. The Bull Bear Power (BBP) indicator reveals strong bullish momentum, suggesting that Starknet (STRK) could soon challenge the $0.48 resistance level. If the token holds above this price point, it could continue its impressive rise. However, a drop below $0.35 could trigger a retracement, leading to further losses.

33422563,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640937,1725973222,Starknet and Mpeppe Bullish Trend Continues Whilst Ethereum (ETH) Struggles To Pick Back Up,"As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, certain projects are demonstrating impressive growth and momentum. Starknet (STRK) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) are two tokens that have recently experienced a bullish trend, while Ethereum (ETH), despite being a foundational blockchain, has been facing challenges in regaining its momentum. Let’s delve into what’s driving Starknet (STRK) and Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s success and explore why Ethereum (ETH) is struggling to pick back up. Starknet: Revolutionizing Ethereum (ETH) Scaling with ZK-Rollups Starknet (STRK), a Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum (ETH), has been at the forefront of innovation by addressing Ethereum (ETH)’s scalability issues. Utilizing Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Rollups, Starknet (STRK) enables multiple transactions to be accumulated into off-chain proofs and submitted to Ethereum (ETH) as a single batch, significantly reducing transaction costs and increasing the speed of operations. This has made Starknet (STRK) a popular choice for developers and users who are looking for faster and more cost-effective ways to interact with the Ethereum (ETH) network. A significant development for Starknet (STRK) is the launch of StarkGuardians, an NFT collection designed to enhance both security and liquidity in the NFT space. StarkGuardians is not just another NFT project but one with a unique utility. It allows users to lend and borrow NFTs through a new protocol launched on the Sepolia testnet. This protocol lets users borrow NFTs in return for cryptocurrencies or vice versa, making NFTs more accessible and liquid without being sold. The NFT lending and borrowing mechanism is a groundbreaking move in making digital assets more functional in decentralized finance (DeFi). Additionally, the StarkGuardians collection, featuring 323 cyber female characters, has been designed with a focus on security and protection of NFT projects. As Starknet (STRK) continues to innovate, the integration of NFTs and financial services creates new opportunities for users to leverage their assets in ways that were previously inaccessible. The introduction of gasless voting on the platform, facilitated by Snapshot X, allows users to participate in on-chain governance without paying gas fees. This has been a major step forward in increasing user engagement and participation in decentralized governance. Mpeppe: Disrupting the Casino Industry with Blockchain Mpeppe (MPEPE) is gaining traction as a decentralized casino platform, offering players an innovative and transparent way to gamble. The platform allows users to earn rewards in a decentralized and provably fair manner. The recent surge in Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s popularity has been driven by its presale success, where it raised over $12 million. The low entry point at $0.0021 per token has attracted a wide range of investors, including those looking for a high-growth project that taps into the burgeoning world of decentralized gaming. One of Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s key strengths is its ability to merge traditional online casinos with blockchain technology, bringing transparency and fairness into play. The platform uses smart contracts to ensure that all transactions and game results are verifiable and cannot be tampered with, which gives players the confidence to engage with the platform. With whales beginning to notice Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s potential, the project is quickly becoming a favored choice among investors seeking exposure to both gaming and blockchain. The project’s success is seen as a bellwether for future decentralized gaming platforms, as more users gravitate toward blockchain-powered entertainment solutions. Ethereum (ETH)’s Struggles Despite Ethereum (ETH) being one of the most important blockchains in the world, it has faced challenges in maintaining its upward momentum. Ethereum (ETH) ’s transition to Ethereum (ETH) 2.0, while highly anticipated, has come with some growing pains. While the shift to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) was meant to improve scalability and energy efficiency, it has not been enough to address the high gas fees and network congestion that users continue to experience. Recently, Ethereum (ETH) whales, who have historically influenced the altcoin’s price, have reduced their buying activity. Since July, on-chain data has shown that large holders have been selling or redistributing their holdings, leading to price stagnation. Ethereum (ETH) is currently facing resistance at the $2,400 level, and unless whale activity picks up again, the asset may struggle to break out of its current range. Additionally, Ethereum (ETH)’s dominance in the DeFi space is being challenged by more scalable Layer-2 solutions like Starknet (STRK). While Ethereum (ETH) remains the backbone of decentralized applications, the introduction of more efficient systems is diverting attention and investment away from the main chain. Developers are increasingly turning to Layer-2s for better transaction speeds and lower fees, making Ethereum (ETH)’s core network less attractive for certain use cases. The Future Outlook: Starknet and Mpeppe Lead the Way Both Starknet (STRK) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) have positioned themselves as leaders in their respective sectors. Starknet (STRK)’s technological innovations, such as gasless voting, parallel execution, and NFT lending protocols, are reshaping how users interact with the blockchain. With StarkGuardians leading the charge in the NFT space and its innovative governance mechanisms, Starknet (STRK) is set to become a critical player in the Ethereum (ETH) ecosystem. On the other hand, Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s approach to disrupting the online casino space through decentralized solutions is tapping into a massive global market. With its low entry cost and transparent gaming model, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is quickly building a dedicated user base and gaining the attention of large investors. While Ethereum (ETH) may be struggling in the short term, the long-term prospects of Layer-2 solutions like Starknet (STRK) are promising. As these projects continue to develop and attract users, the overall Ethereum (ETH)ecosystem will likely benefit from their advancements. For investors, the combination of Ethereum (ETH)’s foundational strength, Starknet (STRK)’s technological prowess, and Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s gaming innovation presents a diversified portfolio of opportunities. Conclusion Starknet (STRK) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) are two standout projects that are continuing their bullish trend while Ethereum (ETH) works to regain its footing. Starknet (STRK)’s cutting-edge solutions in the NFT and Layer-2 space, coupled with Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s innovative approach to decentralized casinos, offer investors unique opportunities for growth. As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, it will be exciting to see how these projects develop and continue to lead the way in their respective fields.

33422503,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640951,1725973218,Sui Price Prediction: SUI Investors Add Mpeppe Casino To Holdings With SUI Profits,"Sui (SUI) has been a hot topic among altcoin investors, especially as it experiences a significant price increase and bullish momentum. With the launch of Sui’s native stablecoin, AUSD, and its role in boosting DeFi activities on the platform, Sui (SUI) has quickly attracted attention. However, while SUI is making strides in the altcoin market, another cryptocurrency, Mpeppe (MPEPE), is starting to gain traction among Ethereum investors and those profiting from Sui (SUI). Sui’s Bullish Momentum Continues Sui (SUI) experienced a remarkable 5% increase on Sunday, with its price rising to $0.935. The surge was mainly fueled by the launch of Sui (SUI)’s native stablecoin, AUSD, which aims to enhance the blockchain’s DeFi operations. AUSD has brought more liquidity to the Sui (SUI) network, further cementing Sui (SUI)’s position as a strong player in the decentralized finance space. The Sui (SUI) price action has been showing signs of a bullish breakout, with critical resistance at $1. If Sui (SUI) can break above this psychological barrier, it could rally toward $1.43 or even $1.72. This potential upside is driven by a combination of technical indicators, including an inverted head-and-shoulder pattern and a positive RSI trend nearing the 60% mark. Despite persistent rejections from the 200-day EMA, Sui (SUI) has maintained strong support at the $0.80 level, which has acted as a solid floor for the token. As long as the price remains above this critical support, the outlook for Sui (SUI) remains bullish. Mpeppe Casino Gains Attention While Sui (SUI) has been making headlines, Ethereum investors and altcoin enthusiasts have also turned their attention to Mpeppe (MPEPE), a decentralized casino platform that is rapidly growing in popularity. Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a unique blend of meme coin culture and DeFi utility, allowing users to stake tokens, gamble, and earn rewards. Mpeppe (MPEPE) has become an attractive option for Sui (SUI) investors looking to diversify their portfolios and leverage profits from Sui (SUI)’s price surge. The casino’s decentralized nature, built on the Ethereum blockchain, ensures transparency and fairness in all transactions. Additionally, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers staking rewards, allowing investors to earn passive income while participating in the platform’s various gambling activities. The appeal of Mpeppe (MPEPE) lies in its innovative approach to combining decentralized gambling with the viral nature of meme coins. With the growing interest in the platform, Ethereum and Sui (SUI) investors are adding Mpeppe (MPEPE) to their holdings, recognizing its potential for high returns. Why SUI Investors Are Adding Mpeppe to Their Holdings Sui (SUI)’s impressive performance has given investors significant profits, and many are now looking for the next opportunity to maximize their returns. Mpeppe (MPEPE) presents a compelling case for these investors due to its unique combination of entertainment, meme culture, and DeFi features. For SUI investors, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a fresh avenue for diversification. While Sui continues to build its reputation in the DeFi space with the launch of AUSD and its growing TVL, Mpeppe (MPEPE) taps into the burgeoning market for decentralized casinos and meme coins. This dual approach allows investors to benefit from both the serious potential of DeFi and the fun, high-reward nature of meme coin investments. Moreover, with Ethereum struggling to break the $2,400 barrier, some ETH investors are looking for alternative assets that can provide quicker profits. Both Sui and Mpeppe (MPEPE) offer such opportunities, especially as Sui approaches key resistance levels and Mpeppe (MPEPE) continues to attract attention in the gambling and meme coin sectors. Price Predictions for Sui and Mpeppe Sui’s price prediction looks optimistic, with the potential to break past $1 and target $1.43 or higher. The bullish indicators, including the RSI and the inverted head-and-shoulder pattern, suggest that Sui has the momentum needed to continue its upward trajectory. On the other hand, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is still in its early stages, but the platform’s unique combination of meme coin excitement and DeFi utility makes it a strong contender for future growth. As more investors recognize the potential for high returns, especially in the decentralized gambling space, Mpeppe (MPEPE) could see significant price appreciation in the coming months. Conclusion Sui (SUI) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) are two altcoins that are capturing the attention of Ethereum investors seeking quick profits and diversification. With Sui’s bullish momentum and the launch of its native stablecoin AUSD, the token is poised for further gains. Meanwhile, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a unique opportunity in the decentralized casino space, combining the viral appeal of meme coins with the security and transparency of blockchain technology. As Sui investors take profits, many are turning to Mpeppe (MPEPE) as the next big opportunity for high returns. Whether through staking, gambling, or simply holding the tokens, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers an exciting alternative in a market that is constantly evolving. With both projects showing strong potential, Sui and Mpeppe (MPEPE) could continue to outperform in the altcoin space, making them top picks for investors looking to capitalize on the next crypto rally.

33422561,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640948,1725973216,$5.4M SUI Whale Adds New Mobile Gaming Cryptocurrency To Long-Term Investments,"The cryptocurrency market has been buzzing with excitement recently, especially with the performance of Sui (SUI) and the emergence of new gaming-related cryptocurrencies. One of the most notable moves in the market recently came from a prominent Sui (SUI) whale who added a staggering $5.4 million to their holdings, including the new mobile gaming cryptocurrency, Mpeppe (MPEPE). SUI’s Recent Surge: A Look at the Price Movement Sui (SUI) has been one of the standout performers in the crypto market, especially since early September. The altcoin, which has been on a consistent rally, is now eyeing a critical resistance level. Following a substantial dip in early August, where Sui (SUI) hit a low of $0.46, the token has recovered dramatically, pushing toward the $1.20 resistance level. The launch of Sui (SUI)’s native stablecoin, AUSD, has also contributed significantly to the recent price rally. AUSD, a stablecoin designed to enhance the decentralized finance (DeFi) operations on the Sui (SUI) blockchain, has brought renewed interest and liquidity to the platform. This, coupled with technical indicators showing bullish momentum, has pushed Sui (SUI)’s price upward. Many technical experts, including Valdrin Tahiri, have pointed out that Sui (SUI) is now nearing its $1.25 resistance level, a critical point that could lead to even further upward momentum if broken. Indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the MACD suggest that the market sentiment is turning bullish for Sui (SUI), setting its sights on $1.45 in the near future. Why SUI Whales Are Adding Mpeppe (MPEPE) As Sui (SUI) continues to rally, one particular Sui (SUI) whale has made a bold move by adding $5.4 million to their portfolio, which now includes the mobile gaming cryptocurrency Mpeppe (MPEPE). This addition has caught the attention of investors and for a good reason. Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a unique blend of decentralized finance, meme culture, and mobile gaming — a combination that is becoming increasingly popular among crypto enthusiasts. Mpeppe (MPEPE), which has positioned itself as a leader in the emerging play-to-earn (P2E) mobile gaming sector, has been designed to capitalize on the growing demand for decentralized gaming platforms. With the rise of mobile gaming and its intersection with the DeFi space, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers users the chance to earn rewards, stake tokens, and participate in games while enjoying a decentralized ecosystem. Whales in the crypto space are known for making strategic moves that reflect their belief in long-term growth. By adding Mpeppe (MPEPE) to their portfolio, the Sui (SUI) whale is signaling confidence in the future of decentralized mobile gaming, especially as more users look for ways to combine gaming with cryptocurrency rewards. The Future of SUI and Mpeppe As Sui (SUI) pushes towards breaking its $1.25 resistance level, analysts are eager to see if the token can maintain its bullish momentum. A successful breakout could push Sui (SUI) toward $1.45 and possibly higher, depending on market sentiment and whale activity. However, if Sui (SUI) fails to break this critical level, a retracement back to support levels at $0.80 could be in the cards. On the other hand, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is positioned to capitalize on the growing mobile gaming market. As more users adopt mobile gaming as a way to earn cryptocurrency, Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s unique play-to-earn model could see significant growth. The platform’s ability to combine entertainment with decentralized finance offers a compelling use case for both gamers and investors alike. Conclusion: A Strategic Move The decision of a SUI whale to add Mpeppe (MPEPE) to their holdings is a strategic move that reflects the growing trend of combining gaming with decentralized finance. As both SUI and Mpeppe (MPEPE) continue to develop, investors will be closely watching how these projects evolve and deliver value to their holders. With Sui eyeing critical resistance levels and Mpeppe (MPEPE) riding the wave of mobile gaming’s increasing popularity, both tokens are positioned for potentially significant gains in the coming months.

42407698,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga0xG2,1725973200,Polygon to Buy $5M of Servers With Computer Chips Devoted to Zero-Knowledge Cryptography,"Polygon Labs, a major developer of Ethereum layer-2 networks, shared Tuesday it is unveiling a new type of computer chip that's optimized for zero-knowledge cryptography processing, built by hardware maker Fabric specifically for Polygon's interoperability solution, AggLayer.  The news comes as Fabric announced last month a $33 million series A round, which Polygon Labs participated in, to create ""verifiable processing units,"" or VPUs, a custom chip designed for cryptography and blockchains.  The ZK team at Polygon has been working with Fabric to create VPUs for its prover libraries, Plonky2 and Plonky3. Provers are a key component of blockchain systems built around zero-knowledge cryptography, which emerged last year as one of the crypto industry's hottest design features, and a key focus for Polygon.  The AggLayer is a Polygon project to make token transfers seamless between affiliated blockchain networks.  “As the latest AggLayer contributor, Fabric will work closely with Polygon Labs to accelerate the AggLayer’s roadmap by developing software to run Plonky2 and Plonky3 on the VPU, and Polygon Labs will work closely with Fabric to ensure future generations of the VPU will accelerate the AggLayer’s long-term roadmap,” Polygon wrote in their press release.  The team also shared that Polygon Labs will acquire $5 million worth of VPU-based server systems as part of today’s announcement, in order to accelerate ZK-proof generation projects on the AggLayer.  “Fabric’s VPUs can accelerate the timeline for wider adoption of zero-knowledge technology from three to five years to six to 12 months,” Polygon co-founder Mihailo Bjelic said in the press release shared with CoinDesk. “For Polygon Labs, implementing this tech will massively accelerate the development of the AggLayer, bringing real-time, affordable proofs that nobody thought would come for years, and much lower proving costs than previously thought possible in the medium-term.”  Read more: Fabric, Startup Building 'VPU' Chips for Cryptography, Raises $33M",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MATIC | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/09/10/polygon-to-buy-5m-of-servers-with-computer-chips-devoted-to-zero-knowledge-cryptography,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f0bccd3df899b7b5abec86d0b725662135fdbf57-1136x639.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

These are also the first charges brought against a person accused of running a network of crypto ATMs in the U.K., the FCA said.  U.K. regulator the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) charged an individual for running a network of illegal crypto ATM's, it said in a press release on Tuesday.  Olumide Osunkoya, 45 year old Londoner has been accused of running crypto ATMs that processed British pounds 2.6 million ($3.4 million) in crypto transactions across various locations between December 2021 and September 2023 without having the required registration. The defendant now has to appear before the Westminster Magistrates’ Court on September 30.  ""These are also the first charges brought against a person accused of running a network of crypto ATMs in the UK,"" the FCA said in its statement.  The charges follow last months arrest of Habibur Rahman, 37 who is also from London. He was the first first person in the U.K. to be charged with operating a single illegal cryptocurrency ATM. He also allegedly laundered $392,557 in cash by converting it into crypto, BBC reported last month.  None of the 44 crypto companies registered have the necessary authorization to have crypto ATM's, making all crypto ATMs in the U.K. illegal.  The FCA has been clamping down on illegal crypto ATMs in recent years. In May last year the FCA alongside the police carried out raids across sites in Exeter, Nottingham and Sheffield. By the end of 2023 the regulator had carried out 34 inspections.  ""Our message today is clear. If you're illegally operating a crypto ATM, we will stop you,"" Therese Chambers, joint executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA said in Tuesdays release.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  CoinDesk 20 Index: 1,817.62 +2.4% Bitcoin (BTC): $57,160 +3.54% Ether (ETH): $2,349.98 +1.54% S&P 500: 5,471.05 +1.16% Gold: $2,504.83 −0.07% Nikkei 225: 36,159.16 −0.16%  Top Stories  Bitcoin fluctuated around $57,000 during the European morning having gained about 3% in the last 24 hours. Still, it remains around 3% lower in September and more than 20% below the all-time high of $73,000 in March. The broader digital asset market has risen about 2.35%, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index. Bitcoin ETFs registered net inflows for the first time in over a week on Monday, gaining $28.7 million. Despite the rally, NYDIG has noted that bitcoin's ""near-term catalysts … are sparse."" The firm wrote on Monday that September is a notoriously weak month for bitcoin prices but, on the bright side, October is generally one of the strongest.  BTC and ETH options trading on derivatives exchange Deribit shows a bias for bearish puts over bullish calls, suggesting traders remain concerned about crypto price weakness in the short term. ""Given the velocity of last week's dip, the market is still very cautious about downside risk,"" QCP's market insights team said in a Telegram broadcast. ""Risk reversals until October are still skewed towards puts in both BTC and ETH."" The cautious sentiment perhaps stems from historical data, which shows recessions and risk aversion tend to follow the start of a Fed rate-cutting cycle. The central bank is widely expected to cut rates by 25 basis points next week. Price rallies could, therefore, be fleeting until the Fed meeting.  Blockchain data provider Nansen bought staking platform StakeWithUs as CEO Alex Svanevik looks to expand beyond data provision into offering investment services for institutions and retail traders. While the purchase price was not disclosed, a spokesperson for the company said it was a seven-figure sum. StakeWithUs, which is backed by the Singapore government's innovation project SGinnovate, provides staking across multiple blockchains. Following its integration, Nansen will offer non-custodial staking for over 20 assets, including SOL, SUI, OSMO and ATOM. ""By enabling staking within Nansen, we are not only expanding our service offerings but also enhancing our support for the blockchain ecosystems we integrate with,"" Svanevik said in a statement.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows ether's session-wise price performance over the past four weeks.  Ether has dropped over 12% in one month, with most losses happening during the U.S. trading hours.  The Asia-Pacific hours have been a source of bullish pressures for the cryptocurrency.

While bearish sentiments remain strong, there are still analysts who believe that bullish times are on the way for the pioneer cryptocurrency. Bernstein analysts have fallen into the bullish camp, as they predict that the Bitcoin price can actually break $90,000, but there’s a caveat to this prediction. Donald Trump Needs To Win US Presidential Elections Bernstein analysts recently revealed that they still believe that the Bitcoin price can rally toward $100,000 from here. However, the event in which this could happen is heavily tied to the highly anticipated United States presidential elections scheduled to take place on Tuesday, November 5, 2024. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Dogecoin Will Rise 3,600% To $3.7, Here’s When In a note to clients on Monday, the analysts, Mahika Sapra, Sanskar Chindalia, and Gautam Chhugani, have brought it down to a preferred candidate and that is former president Donald Trump. According to the analysts, Donald Trump emerging as the next president of the United States would be great for the Bitcoin price. This is because Trump has been very vocal about his support of the crypto industry, holding a couple of millions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency himself. They explained that a victory for Donald Trump would push the price higher, putting it somewhere win the range of $80,000 to $90,000 by the fourth quarter of 2024. In contrast, they believe that a win for Democratic candidate, Vice President Kamala Harris, would be very bearish for the crypto industry. In fact, they forecast a notable crash in the Bitcoin price if Harris were to emerge victorious over Donald Trump. The target here is a fall below $50,000, and possibly reaching as low as $30,000 in the subsequent crash. Trump Favors Bitcoin When it comes to Bitcoin, Donald Trump has been the most vocal candidate, even going as far as to propose a national Bitcoin stockpile, which is basically a repository for the BTC held by the government. The proposal drew criticism from industry leaders who believe that it could lead to a diversion of seized crypto funds from their intended purpose. However, the message in the proposal has already been passed, and that is Donald Trump’s support for Bitcoin.

Donald Trump also launched a Bitcoin-themed sneaker line in early August, after delivering a keynote speech at the 2024 Bitcoin conference. To top it all off, Trump has previously stated that he believes that Bitcoin could be a strategic reserve asset for the United States. All of the above have led investors to believe that a win for Donald Trump in November would be a win for crypto.

33420324,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=24124,1725967871,"Bitfinex Alpha 121 | Bitcoin Bị Kéo Theo Thị Trường Chứng Khoán, Altcoin Tranh Thủ Vượt Mặt","Tải Full báo cáo Tuần trước, BTC mở màn tháng 9 với cú giảm 10,7% , tiếp tục xu hướng đi xuống từ cuối tháng 8. Cú giảm này cũng đẩy giá xuống dưới mức thấp quan trọng $56,711 từng thấy vào ngày 1 tháng 5 , một mức giá trước đây thường kích hoạt sự phục hồi nhanh chóng. Không ngạc nhiên, đợt bán tháo này dẫn đến việc giảm các vị thế đòn bẩy, cho thấy thị trường có thể đang gần đáy cục bộ. Tuy nhiên, chúng tôi tin rằng thị trường chứng khoán Mỹ, đặc biệt là S&P 500 – đã có tuần tồi tệ nhất kể từ tháng 3 năm 2023 – là yếu tố quan trọng đối với quỹ đạo ngắn hạn của Bitcoin. Mối tương quan giữa giá Bitcoin và thị trường tài chính truyền thống vẫn còn , với dòng tiền ETF giao ngay đáng kể chảy ra trong tuần qua cho thấy các nhà đầu tư tài chính truyền thống đang giảm rủi ro từ tiền điện tử. Đáng chú ý, kể từ ngày 27 tháng 8, đã có 706,1 triệu đô la dòng tiền ròng chảy ra khỏi các quỹ ETF Bitcoin và xu hướng giảm trong Khối lượng Tích lũy Giao ngay, cho thấy hoạt động bán giao ngay mạnh mẽ . Ngược lại, thị trường altcoin đã cho thấy khả năng phục hồi . Khi đợt bán tháo diễn ra vào tuần trước, sự thống trị của Bitcoin , đo lường vốn hóa thị trường của BTC so với phần còn lại của thị trường tiền điện tử, đã giảm 1,3%. Trong khi đó, vốn hóa thị trường của tất cả các tài sản tiền điện tử khác (ngoại trừ top 10) đã tăng 4,4%. Liệu sự thay đổi này ám chỉ một sự thay đổi tiềm năng, nơi các nhà đầu tư đang khám phá giá trị trong altcoin, khác với mô hình điển hình là đổ xô vào Bitcoin trong thời kỳ suy thoái? Tuy nhiên, mức độ quan tâm mở đối với altcoin cũng đã giảm 55% so với mức cao nhất mọi thời đại, cho thấy sự thờ ơ đầu cơ và khả năng cạn kiệt trong số những người bán. Tỷ lệ ETH/BTC , như một đại diện cho thị trường altcoin, vẫn dưới Đường Trung bình Đơn giản 365 ngày của nó, phản ánh sự kém hiệu quả rộng hơn của ETH kể từ khi Merge . Tuy nhiên, nếu sự thống trị của Bitcoin thực sự đã đạt đến đỉnh cục bộ, chúng ta có thể thấy một giai đoạn altcoin vượt trội trong những tháng tới, có khả năng tạo tiền đề cho một quý 4 tăng giá nếu áp lực kinh tế vĩ mô giảm bớt. Chất xúc tác chính cho đợt bán tháo vào tuần trước được cho là báo cáo thị trường lao động Mỹ cho tháng 8 chỉ cho thấy sự tăng trưởng khiêm tốn. Tuy nhiên, chúng tôi coi đây là một sự trấn an đối với Cục Dự trữ Liên bang khi họ chuẩn bị chuyển sang hạ lãi suất. Số liệu việc làm tăng ít hơn dự đoán, nhưng tỷ lệ thất nghiệp giảm xuống 4,2% từ 4,3% trong tháng 7. Trong lĩnh vực sản xuất, bằng chứng về sự tiếp tục suy thoái trong tháng thứ năm liên tiếp đã xuất hiện . Được thúc đẩy bởi nhu cầu yếu, đây là bằng chứng thêm để hỗ trợ việc hạ lãi suất. Các công ty đang cắt giảm sản xuất để duy trì lợi nhuận, phản ánh sự chậm lại rộng hơn trong hoạt động kinh tế. Ngành xây dựng cũng đang có dấu hiệu căng thẳng. Cục Thống kê Dân số thuộc Bộ Thương mại Hoa Kỳ báo cáo chi tiêu xây dựng giảm 0,3% trong tháng 7, sau khi không thay đổi trong tháng 6. Sự sụt giảm này tồi tệ hơn dự kiến, phản ánh sự chậm lại rộng hơn trên thị trường nhà ở khi khả năng chi trả giảm và sự suy yếu của sự bùng nổ nhà ở thời đại đại dịch ảnh hưởng đến doanh số bán hàng. Nhà ở đang ở trên thị trường lâu hơn và các nhà xây dựng đang thận trọng trong việc bắt đầu các dự án mới do hàng tồn kho tăng và nhu cầu yếu hơn. Nhìn chung, trong khi một số lĩnh vực đang có những cải thiện nhẹ, thì những lĩnh vực khác đang vật lộn với hoạt động giảm sút. Trong tin tức tiền điện tử tuần trước, ba ngân hàng lớn của Nhật Bản—MUFG, SMBC và Mizuho—đang ra mắt “ Dự án Pax ”, một chương trình thí điểm sử dụng stablecoin dựa trên blockchain để hợp lý hóa các khoản thanh toán xuyên biên giới và đang hướng tới triển khai thương mại vào năm 2025. Dự án sẽ tích hợp API của SWIFT để đảm bảo tuân thủ và hiệu quả. Trong khi đó, Cục Dự trữ Liên bang đã ban hành lệnh ngừng hoạt động đối với United Texas Bank do những thiếu sót mà họ phát hiện trong hoạt động quản lý rủi ro và chống rửa tiền liên quan đến khách hàng tiền điện tử của mình. Họ đã yêu cầu ngân hàng cải thiện quy trình giám sát và thẩm định khách hàng của mình. Chúc các bạn một tuần giao dịch bội thu cùng các phân tích chuyên sâu từ Bitfinex Alpha 121!

A 2023 report from TRM Labs showed that the Tron blockchain was home to nearly 45% of all illicit crypto volume. Now, the blockchain founded by Justin Sun is working with TRM Labs and USDT issuer Tether in a task force created to fight financial crime.  “TRON originated with the belief that technology can be used for good and to empower people across the globe,” Sun said in a release. “By collaborating with TRM Labs and Tether, TRON is helping to ensure that blockchain technology is used to make our world a better place, and sends a clear message that illicit activity is not welcome in our industry.”  The task force, the T3 Financial Crime Unit (T3 FCU), will combat illicit activity involving USDT, the largest stablecoin, on Tron. Data from Tether shows there’s $60.7 billion of USDT issued on Tron, $53.9 billion on the Ethereum blockchain and $712 million on Solana.  The T3 FCU said it has already frozen $12 million in USDT tied to blackmail scams and investment fraud.  According to a release, TRM Labs will use its intelligence suite to help Tron and Tether analyze blockchain activity to detect suspicious patterns.  Representatives from TRM Labs said that while the total illicit volume of crypto remains low, the goal is to push it to zero.  “As adoption of stablecoins continues to rise, it’s critical that key industry players proactively evolve their capabilities to combat illicit activity and ensure a safe and secure environment,” Chris Janczewski, head of global investigations at TRM Labs, said in a release.

Particularly, according to a recent analysis by a CryptoQuant analyst known as ‘Heisenberg,’ the netflow of Ethereum on derivative exchanges has seen a significant negative shift, exceeding 40,000 ETH. Related Reading: Ethereum’s Plunge Could Be Over: This Key Pattern Signals A Rally Back To $4,000 Ethereum Derivative Market Outflow: What It Means For ETH Heisenberg explained that netflow refers to the difference between the amount of Ethereum entering exchanges (inflows) and the amount being withdrawn (outflows). A negative netflow indicates that more ETH is withdrawn from derivative exchanges than deposited. This is particularly relevant because derivative exchanges, such as leveraged positions or short selling, are often used for trading. A negative netflow of 40,000 ETH, as reported by Heisenberg, could be a signal suggesting that the selling pressure on Ethereum may be reduced, which could lead to a less volatile market in the coming days. Negative netflow exceeding 40,000 $ETH on derivative exchanges “Indicates that more ETH is being withdrawn from Derivative Exchanges, which might suggest reduced selling pressure.” – By @3AMRTAHA_ Full post 👇https://t.co/5v0PWwq9Mw pic.twitter.com/MrE4zRNQro — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) September 9, 2024 Elaborating on this phenomenon, when more Ethereum is withdrawn from exchanges than deposited, it generally indicates that investors and traders are holding onto their assets rather than selling them. This reduction in selling pressure is a major metric for assessing the potential stability of Ethereum’s price in the near term. In addition, the reduced borrowing on derivative exchanges might indicate a decreased interest in opening new short positions, further reducing the downward pressure on Ethereum’s price. ETH Market Performance And Outlook Notably, the implication of this increased outflow of ETH on derivative exchanges is not reflected in the asset’s market price. As mentioned earlier, the current trend in this metric signals reduced downward pressure for ETH. However, the asset remains drowning in red according to ETH’s latest price performance. Particularly, over the past week alone, ETH has still been down by 9.2%. Although the asset has seen a slight 0.5% increase in price over the past day, this was not enough to make ETH’s price see a major recovery. At the time of writing, the asset currently trades for $2,282, with a 24-hour high of $2,334 and a 24-hour low of $2,246. As for its daily trading volume, this metric has also refused to see a significant increase. Related Reading: Is Ethereum Headed For Trouble?

Blockchain data provider Nansen said it bought staking platform StakeWithUs as CEO Alex Svanevik looks to expand beyond data provision into offering investment services for institutions and retail traders.

Stakers lock away their tokens, participate in the verification process, and receive more tokens as a reward.

Crypto adoption has remained steady in the U.S. and the U.K. in recent years, despite some significant headwinds, and the retail market now looks ready for a rebound, crypto platform Gemini said in its '2024 Global State of Crypto' report on Tuesday.  The report was based on a survey of 6,000 people in the U.S., U.K., France, Singapore and Turkey, and was carried out online from May 23 to June 28 this year.  Crypto adoption was broadly unchanged in the U.S. and the U.K. from 2022 to 2024, at 21% and 18% respectively, the report said. Ownership of digital assets in France rose to 18% from 16% over the same period, while in Singapore this figure fell from 30% to 26%.  Almost two-thirds of those surveyed said they held crypto for its long-term investment potential, and 38% said they held the asset class as a hedge against inflation, Gemini said.  Still, lack of regularity clarity remains a barrier to ownership. In the U.S. and the U.K., 38% of people who didn't own crypto cited regulatory concerns as a reason for not investing in the asset class, the survey showed. In France, 32% of people said the same, and in Singapore almost half of respondents said regulations were a concern.  Spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have brought growth to the market, with 37% of holders in the U.S. saying they held some crypto via an ETF.  The majority of crypto holders said they wanted to allocate 5% or more to digital assets, the report noted.  The gender gap in crypto was slightly more pronounced in 2024 than 2022, the report said, with 69% of holders identifying as male and 31% female.  A large majority of 73% of crypto holders in the U.S. said they planned to consider a candidate's digital asset policies when they vote in the upcoming presidential election in November.

42407705,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga0xZs,1725965768,"Crypto Traders Remain Cautious About Downside Risks in Bitcoin, Ether; SOL Stands Out","Options data show a bias for short-term puts, or bearish positions, in bitcoin and ether.  Cautious sentiment persists as a Federal Reserve interest-rate cut nears.  SOL is likely to remain more resilient than ether.  Prices for the two biggest cryptocurrencies, bitcoin {{BTC}} and ether {{ETH}}, have bounced almost 10% from Friday's lows amid bullish signals from key order book metrics and expectations for a Federal Reserve interest-rate cut next week.  Still, traders remain concerned that prices are set to show weakness in the short term. That's the message from options-based risk reversals tied to bitcoin and ether.  A positive risk reversal suggests that call options are more expensive than puts, indicating bullish sentiment in the market, while a negative figure suggests the opposite. Call options allow the buyer to profit from or hedge against price rallies; puts offer downside protection.  According to Singapore-based QCP Capital, options trading on Deribit shows a bias for puts.  ""Given the velocity of last week's dip, the market is still very cautious about downside risk,"" QCP's market insights team said in a Telegram broadcast. ""Risk reversals until October are still skewed towards puts in both BTC and ETH.""  Traders turned to put options on Friday after a weak U.S. nonfarm payrolls (NFP) print revived recession concerns, triggering risk aversion in financial markets.  ""NFP failed to reassure markets. Fast money continued to add to Puts buying 1week $49-$53k Puts when BTC <$55k,"" Deribit Insight's Tony Stewart said in a market update.  According to Stewart, recent options market flows point to concern that BTC will drop to $50,000 or even $40,000. At press time, the biggest cryptocurrency by market value was priced around $57,000, CoinDesk data show.  The cautious sentiment perhaps stems from historical data, which shows recessions and risk aversion tend to follow the start of a Fed rate-cutting cycle. The central bank is widely expected to cut rates by 25 basis points next week.  Price rallies could be fleeting until the Fed meeting, according to Alex Kuptsikevich, the senior analyst at The FxPro.  ""In our view, caution and a tendency to sell growth will prevail in the market, at least until the release of U.S. inflation data on Wednesday. This could continue until the Fed's interest rate decision on September 18th,"" Kuptsikevich said in an email.  SOL seen as relatively resilient  Market participants expect Solana's sol {{SOL}} to remain relatively resilient, outperforming ether in the near-term.  SOL's one-month options skew, another measure of demand for calls relative to puts, crossed above zero early Tuesday, according to Amberdata.

33417445,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640850,1725962429,Cardano Foundation Reports Massive Growth In These Key Metrics – ADA Price Soars 3%,"In August, the Cardano (ADA) ecosystem experienced significant growth across several key metrics, coinciding with the anticipated Chang upgrade, which was successfully implemented on September 1. Despite the bearish market sentiment that affected ADA’s price during this period, the Cardano Foundation reported increased investor activity and blockchain usage. August Highlights In a recent social media post, the Foundation detailed the performance of various transaction types within the ecosystem. Notably, smart contract transactions surged by 31%, while metadata transactions (excluding smart contracts) grew by 20%. However, simple transactions faced a decline of 49%. Overall, Cardano recorded a total of 95.9 million transactions in August, marking a slight increase of 1.51%. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Dogecoin Will Rise 3,600% To $3.7, Here’s When The number of wallets created on the blockchain also saw positive movement, rising by 0.67% to reach 4.87 million. Conversely, the number of delegated wallets decreased by nearly 1%, totaling 1.33 million. Additionally, there was a 0.75% increase in plutus scripts, with 6,709 new smart contracts created, enabling developers to build secure decentralized applications without intermediaries. Cardano’s native tokens experienced a 0.85% increase, culminating in the creation of 10.3 million new tokens. The most significant growth was recorded in policy creation, which saw a remarkable 6.53% surge with 160,299 new policies introduced. Cardano Enters 90-Day Bootstrap Phase Looking ahead, Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, shared insights into the upcoming developmental and governance phases of the network following the Chang hard fork. In a recent update, Hoskinson described the current state of the Cardano network as entering a “90-day bootstrap phase,” during which key governance components will be activated. Hoskinson outlined the roadmap for the Chang hard fork, detailing the transition to the age of Voltaire, where the network will achieve full decentralization. During this bootstrap phase, various initiatives, including the registration of Delegated Representatives (DReps) and the formation of an interim Constitutional Committee, will take place. Hoskinson also announced plans for the “Chang +1 upgrade,” expected to bring about fully decentralized governance by December 2024. In tandem with these governance reforms, Cardano is drafting its first formal constitution, with over 50 workshops held globally to engage stakeholders in the process. Delegates elected during these workshops will contribute to a constitutional convention scheduled to occur in Argentina this December, where the proposed V1 constitution will be developed. Related Reading: Dogecoin To $0.15: Analyst Explains What Could Kick Off A Fresh Rally Furthermore, Hoskinson revealed that Cardano’s treasury, valued at approximately $600 million in ADA, will undergo an annual budgeting process to address the ecosystem’s needs, including marketing and development initiatives. The blockchain’s founder emphasized a significant shift towards decentralization, indicating that Input Output Global (IOG), the engineering firm behind the Cardano ecosystem will eventually relinquish its governance role, and DReps will no longer be necessary. Amid these developments, market intelligence platform Santiment highlighted a surge in address activity for ADA. Historically, increased address activity during price declines often signals a potential rebound. Currently, ADA has seen a nearly 3% increase over the past week, trading at around $0.344, with a recent 2% rise in the last 24 hours. However, the token still reflects a monthly loss of nearly 1%.

33417701,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=24117,1725962118,Bitfinex to List JUSTICE Token from AssangeDAO Team,"ROAD TOWN, Tortola, British Virgin Islands – 10 September 2024 — Bitfinex (https://www.bitfinex.com/), a premier digital asset trading platform, announced today that it will list JUSTICE, the native token of AssangeDAO , a decentralised autonomous organisation focused on promoting the protection of freedom of speech worldwide. AssangeDAO was formed to advocate for Julian Assange’s release and support similar causes through decentralised finance initiatives. The JUSTICE token serves as a fundraising tool for these efforts, allowing supporters to contribute to the cause in a transparent and secure manner. Additionally, holders of JUSTICE can participate in governance decisions within the DAO, vote on proposals, and shape the future direction of the organisation’s initiatives, making it more than just a token of support but a tool for active engagement in the cause. Bitfinex’s decision to list the JUSTICE token underscores its ongoing commitment to defending freedom of speech and resisting censorship . Initially launched to support Julian Assange’s legal defense, the token has evolved into a symbol of a broader movement advocating for transparency and the right to free expression. Though Assange’s immediate need for financial support has passed, the principles behind the JUSTICE token continue to resonate as a representation of the fight against censorship in today’s digital landscape. This listing reflects Bitfinex’s core mission, that safeguarding individual rights, including the unrestricted flow of information, is essential to maintaining a decentralised and open society. “JUSTICE represents a powerful convergence of activism and decentralised finance, embodying the spirit of freedom and transparency that the crypto world aspires to achieve,” said Henry Child, Head of Tokens at Bitfinex. “We are honoured to list JUSTICE on our platform, allowing our users to participate in this meaningful movement.” Deposits for JUSTICE are expected to open at approximately 12:00 PM UTC on 10/09/2024, subject to network conditions. Trading is planned to commence at approximately 10:00 PM UTC on 12/09/2024, contingent upon liquidity requirements being met. JUSTICE will be tradable against US Dollars (JUSTICE/USD) and Tether tokens (JUSTICE/USDt).

However, there is a possibility that by initiating a 50 bps rate cut, the Fed might raise the alarm for risk-on assets such as Bitcoin. Data released on September 6, 2024, from the Bureau of Labor Statistics stated that while unemployment has decreased slightly, the US economy generated fewer than expected jobs. This has paved the way for the Fed to embark on its rate-cutting cycle, as the central bank doesn’t want high interest rates to cause irreparable damage to businesses. Related Reading: How Will The US Upcoming Fed Rate Cut Impact Bitcoin? QCP Analysts Weigh In 10x Research notes that a 50 bps rate cut on September 18, 2024, might signal a sense of uneasiness toward the economy. It could also, unintentionally convey that the Fed believes it is too late to manage the looming economic downturn, forcing investors to pivot away from risky assets such as stocks and cryptocurrencies. For the uninitiated, one basis point represents 1/100th of a percentage point. Central banks worldwide typically increase or decrease interest rates by 25 bps or multiples, depending on the urgency. Notably, there were several instances in 2022 when the Fed hiked interest rates by 50 or even 75 bps to tackle inflation. In a note shared with clients today, Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, stated: While a 50 basis point cut by the Fed might signal deeper concerns to the markets, the Fed’s primary focus will be mitigating economic risks rather than managing market reactions. Adding: The probability of a 50 basis point cut is only 29%, contrasting our view and the prevailing consensus. The chorus is growing louder that the Fed is behind the curve, having missed signs of labor market weakness after being caught off guard in July. Critical For The Fed To Walk The Thin Line Macro trader Craig Shapiro echoed 10x Research’s findings in a post on X, saying that despite the market pressure on the Fed to “go bigger and faster” with rate cuts, it should not cave in by starting with a 50 bps cut. Shapiro added that the markets are addicted to liquidity, and in its absence, it “revolts, sells off and finds the lower put strike level” that forces the Fed to hasten rate cuts and provide more liquidity. Shapiro asserts that risk assets will decline in value until the Fed capitulates and gives the market what it wants.

When the value of this metric is high, it means the users have just opened up a large amount of new addresses on the network. This could be because of new investors coming into the market or old ones who had left earlier returning to it. The trend can also occur when existing users open fresh addresses for stronger privacy. In general, all of these would happen at once whenever the metric registers a spike, so some adoption could be assumed to be taking place on the net. On the other hand, the low indicator implies that not many new addresses are being created on the network, a potential sign that interest in cryptocurrency is low. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Ethereum Network Growth over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the Ethereum Network Growth observed a sharp spike yesterday, as 126,210 new addresses appeared on the blockchain within 24 hours. This latest value is the largest indicator observed in more than four months, suggesting that the asset attracts an extraordinary number of users. Generally, adoption is bullish for any asset in the long term, as a wider user base can provide a stronger foundation for future price moves to grow. In the short term, though, spikes in the Network Growth can take the coin’s price in either direction. The graph shows that spikes in the indicator coincided with some local tops in August. These spikes were a sign of FOMO around the price surges, and excessive hype has never been positive for any asset, which may be why the tops occurred. Related Reading: Why Has Bitcoin Been Bearish Lately? CryptoQuant Head Chimes In This time around, however, the increase in the Network Growth has come as Ethereum has been going down instead. This surge in interest while the asset isn’t doing so well could potentially help fuel a rebound. ETH Price Ethereum has struggled recently, as its price is currently under the $2,280 mark.

Over the past week, Ethereum has recorded a 9.2% decline in value, reflecting broader market weakness. However, the past 24 hours have brought a slight change in momentum, with ETH seeing a 3.2% increase in price. Though this uptick is not enough to erase the previous week’s losses, it may signal the beginning of a recovery phase. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Recovery May Stall Near 100-SMA: Is a Drop Coming? Is Ethereum At The End Of Its Correction According to the latest analysis from renowned crypto analyst Alex Clay on X, Ethereum might be gradually recovering because its recent bearish market might be concluding. He emphasized that if ETH can maintain consolidation above key technical zones, specifically the 200-day moving average (MA) and 200-day exponential moving average (EMA), it would provide a strong foundation for an upward rally. A significant price break above the $2,500 mark could confirm that the correction has ended and the asset is primed for recovery. Furthermore, while Clay had previously been optimistic about Ethereum reaching a much higher price target, he has revised his expectations based on recent market conditions. #ETH/USD Imo we are at the end of the $ETH correction💁‍♂️ Looking for some consolidation above the Key Zone + 200 MA & 200 EMA confluence Break above $2500 will serve a confirmation of the beginning of the rally🚀#Ethereum turned to be a heavy asset so $10k target is rather… pic.twitter.com/jjGPPUHWE3 — Alex Clay (@cryptclay) September 9, 2024 Clay noted: “Ethereum turned to be a heavy asset, so $10k target is rather a dream than reality so I changed my mind.” For now, the analyst has set more realistic targets, with a mid-term goal of $4,000 and long-term targets ranging from a conservative $6,255 to an optimistic $7,942. Other Analysts Eye Falling Wedge Pattern As Key Indicator Aside from Clay’s analysis, Ethereum’s technical chart has been the focus of several prominent analysts, including Anup Dhungana and Captain Faibik, who have recently identified the potential for a bullish breakout for ETH. For instance, Dhungana’s ETH/BTC chart analysis suggests that a rebound from key support levels and a break from the falling wedge pattern could significantly increase Ethereum’s price. For context, falling wedges are generally viewed as bullish reversal patterns in technical analysis, and confirming a breakout could signal an exponential upward trend. Related Reading: Ethereum Forms Falling Wedge Pattern That Could Send Price To $3,000 Similarly, Captain Faibik echoed this sentiment, sharing an image of altcoin market chart that also displayed a falling wedge formation. Faibik predicted that altcoins could break out of the wedge pattern shortly, potentially pushing major altcoins, including ETH, toward a recovery in the fourth quarter of 2024. He advised investors to remain patient, accumulate altcoins, and prepare for a bounce back that could see prices return to their March 2024 highs.

Base’s largest DeFi protocol, Aerodrome Finance, shows that almost all of the top markets, especially when excluding stablecoin swaps, are memecoin-linked trading pools.  The ease with which users of Coinbase can onboard to Base has also been a winner, done via a smart contract wallet without the need for seed phrases and the like.  Among the rapidly growing ranks of layer-2 blockchains built atop Ethereum, the U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase's own version, Base, hardly stands out as a technological pioneer. The entire project was built and launched last year using code borrowed from another team – Optimism, with its OP Stack framework for easily spinning up new layer-2 networks.  That's partly why it's so remarkable that Base has shot to the No. 2 spot on the key industry leaderboard L2Beat, with an 18% market share of 74 active layer-2 networks. Top-ranked Arbitrum's Arbitrum One dominates with a 40% share, but Base has shot past older, competing projects from teams with hard-fought reputations for cutting-edge development, including Starknet, Polygon, even Optimism itself.  These layer-2 networks are designed to execute transactions faster and cheaper than the base Ethereum blockchain. The layer-2 networks use what's known as a ""sequencer"" to bundle up transactions and then record or ""settle"" them on the main blockchain, not too dissimilar from inking records in a county clerk's office. Sometimes referred to as rollups, layer 2s have become a key element of the broader Ethereum ecosystem's roadmap for scaling toward a world where more, or maybe someday, most, of finance takes place on the digital rails.  But it turns out that the race for blockchain supremacy, just as in broader industry, is reliant to a large extent on marketing savvy and an ample warchest to spend on attracting new customers – not just whoever has the best tech. And Coinbase has helped to fuel Base's growth through its own advertising campaigns and promotional events, including the recently concluded ""Onchain Summer.""  The question now is whether the activity is sustainable. Are the accounts bona fide users with on-chain needs, or just a flurry of tire-kicking beta testers curious to try out the various protocols built atop Base? Are they opportunistic ""degen"" crypto traders taking advantage of one-time promotions and quests to collect extra riches, or racking up usage in hopes of eventually collecting tokens rewards?  The company said Monday in a press release that the three-month Onchain Summer event saw participation of over 2 million unique wallets (compared to about 268,000 in 2023), resulting in over $5 million in mint revenue to creators.  “The results really blew us away,"" a Coinbase spokesperson said in an email. ""The 2.2 million unique wallets participating was about 8x what we saw last year, and more than double our internal expectations.” Base is helmed by Jesse Pollak, who joined Coinbase in 2017 as an engineering manager before moving in 2021 to oversee the company's protocols development.  Independent blockchain data confirms the growth at Base. A recent chart from on-chain data provider Token Terminal shows the network accelerating in recent months while other layer 2s were experiencing a dropoff.  A quick glance at Coinbase's most-recent quarterly report, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, shows that the crypto exchange spent over $165 million on sales and marketing during the three months ending June 30, more than double the amount spent during the same period a year earlier.  During the first quarter of 2024, Coinbase reported ""other"" transaction revenues of $52.5 million, which includes so-called sequencer fees collected by Base.  Memecoin madness  Base has done a good job of competing with the likes of Solana – a layer-1 blockchain that competes with Ethereum but is also known for fast and cheap transactions – as well as other Ethereum layer 2s, particularly when it comes to decentralized finance (DeFi) applications like the swapping of longer-tail assets and money markets, according to Rob Hadick, general partner at VC firm Dragonfly.  On daily active addresses (“DAUs”) and daily transactions, Base has overtaken other layer 2s, and for many of the other important DeFi metrics (like TVL, sequencer fees, etc), the project has moved into the top five, Hadick said.  What are the specific drivers of traffic, though? A close look at Base’s largest DeFi protocol, Aerodrome Finance, shows that almost all of the top markets, especially when excluding stablecoin swaps, are memecoin-linked trading pools. Such activity is notoriously hot-and-cold, and memecoin traders notoriously fickle with their venues.  “Looking at Uniswap on Base, the same thing is true, with two of the top five tokens traded being memecoins,” Hadick said via email. “Not dissimilar to Solana, they’ve competed quite well in these long-tail token-trading markets, as more young users have moved towards speculating on memecoins.”  Also driving the success of Base is the ease of moving tokens over from Coinbase, which is done via a smart contract wallet without the need for seed phrases and the complexity of other wallets.  “The ease of moving through that funnel from Coinbase to Base automatically onboards many of the on-chain curious retail investors who otherwise would need to go through extra steps to participate in DeFi,” Hadick said.  For Oskari Tempakka, head of growth at Token Terminal, it’s down to the foundational strength of the Coinbase-Optimism duo: being a U.S.-listed crypto exchange, combined with Optimism’s scale and expertise in areas like decentralized governance.  The pairing “positions Base exceptionally well by leveraging Coinbase's brand, distribution and partnerships,"" Tempakka said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | SPONSORED,"Ian Allison, Bradley Keoun",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/09/10/coinbase-layer-2-success-shows-power-of-marketing-over-cutting-edge-tech,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fe2b42d4ad0257a42ab52d39e8c7168e7112c703-794x447.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

SOL price is rising and might aim for a move toward the $150 resistance level. SOL price started a recovery wave above the $125 level against the US Dollar. The price is now trading above $128 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $130 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $138 resistance zone. Solana Price Extends Losses Solana price formed a support base above the $120 level and started a recovery wave like Bitcoin and Ethereum. SOL traded above the $125 and $128 resistance levels. The price even climbed above $132 and tested the key barrier at $138. A high was formed at $137 and the price is now consolidating gains. There was a minor decline below $135 and the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $120 swing low to the $137 high. Solana is now trading above $130 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is also a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $130 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $135 level. The next major resistance is near the $138 level. A successful close above the $135 and $138 resistance levels could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is near $142. Any more gains might send the price toward the $150 level. Another Decline in SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $138 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $130 level and the trend line. The first major support is near the $126 level and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $120 swing low to the $137 high. A break below the $126 level might send the price toward $120. If there is a close below the $120 support, the price could decline toward the $110 support in the near term.

42407706,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga0xdB,1725944670,Bitcoin ETFs Post $28.7M Inflows After Record Losing Streak,"The U.S.-listed BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) hit $28.7 million in inflows on Monday, ending a long losing streak.  BTC is trading below $56.5K, while the CoinDesk 20 (CD20) is up 2.3%.  Spot bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) listed in the U.S. posted just over $28.7 million in net inflows on Monday, ending a record outflow streak worth $1.2 billion, data shows.  The ETFs lost money since Aug. 27, and Monday was the first day of net inflows in September – a month that traders have previously warned to be bearish for the leading cryptocurrency. Outflows from ETFs signal a lack of new demand among professional investors.  The outflows have taken net inflows since inception to under the $17 billion mark, back to levels last seen in July. Meanwhile, BTC prices are down nearly 15% in the past two weeks – or 25% below March’s lifetime peak of $73,300.  However, some traders remain bullish despite such price action.  “Even with all the near-term noise and volatile price action, we remain structurally bullish,” QCP Capital traders said in a Telegram broadcast Tuesday. “And it certainly looks like the market is also taking advantage of this leg lower to pile on more longer-term bullish trades.”  ""The bounce from $52,500 is encouraging. So have we seen the bottom? Although we can't be certain, some institutions seem to think so as they take this opportunity to add to their bullish bets in Dec and Mar,"" traders added.  The CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a measure of the largest and most liquid digital assets, is up 2.3%, trading at 1,800.  Meanwhile, BTC is trading above $56,500, slipping from $57,000, ahead of the next CPI and PPI release and the first debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris.  Polymarket traders are pretty certain that crypto isn't going to be mentioned during the debate, giving only an 11% chance of Harris mentioning the term (or bitcoin) and a 13% chance of Trump saying it.  Traders are also expecting the debate to run overtime, with only a 30% chance of it ending on schedule at 10:30 pm.  Elsewhere, several prominent AI tokens were well into the green during the first half of Asia's business day, with the CoinGecko category up 10%.

The platform’s native token, FRIEND, plummeted over 42%, reaching its all-time low (ATL) price amid the controversy. As a result, an Ethereum (ETH) whale saw its investment in the token drop by over 95%. Related Reading: FET Teeters At Trendline: Will A Breakout Fuel A Run To $1.86? Friend.tech Loses Investors’ Trust Over the weekend, crypto platform Friend.tech announced its decision to resign control over its smart contracts to avoid future changes. Friends.tech is a Social Finance (SocialFi) platform launched in 2023 that combines the principles of social media and Decentralized Finance (DeFi). The project is a blockchain-based social platform built on Ethereum’s Layer-2 Base, offering users the potential to profit from content creation. The crypto platform allows creators to monetize their content by using tradeable tokenized shares, known as “Keys,” to access their exclusive publications and private chats. On September 7, Friend.tech’s team revealed it had sent the admin and ownership of its smart contracts to Ethereum’s null address “to prevent any changes to their fees or functionality in the future.” Per the post, the change won’t affect the “separate web client operated at friend.tech which will continue as is.” Additionally, fees from the smart contracts or the platform are not going to the developer team’s multisig. Following the news, the project’s community shared their discontent, expressing their disbelief about the decision. A community member called the team’s recent actions “The best display of WORST LEADERSHIP ever in crypto history.” Meanwhile, others questioned whether the decision was “the final nails in the coffin, or ribbons on a present?” Investor’s doubt was founded in May when the project’s airdrop presented several issues. However, distrust was cemented when the platform announced it would build its blockchain, “Friendchain,” in June. After the backlash, Friend.tech announced it had abandoned the project in a now-deleted post. This decision dragged its token’s price down by over 35% in July. Crypto Whale Investment Drops 94% Since the news dropped, FRIEND’s price decreased by 42%. The cryptocurrency plummeted from the $0.102 mark to the $0.0593 level over the weekend. On Monday morning, the crash drove the token’s price to its ATL of $0.0574, nearly a 98% drop from its all-time high (ATH) of $3.26. As the token hit its lowest price, a crypto investor saw its investment nosedive over 95%. Blockchain research platform Spotonchain revealed that a whale had lost over $15 million on its FRIEND holdings. Per the report, Taiwanese personality Machi Big Brother was a “hard-core bull” on the platform’s token. The whale was at nearly $16 million in realized and unrealized losses after spending around $18 million worth of ETH to acquire FRIEND tokens. Machi bought 15.99 million FRIEND tokens between May 9 and August 13 at an average price of $1.125. The trader also accumulated FRIEND by providing liquidity on BunnySwap during this period. As the token’s value declined over the months, the investor sold around 5.26 million tokens to cut loss. At the time, the sale was worth $2.27 million at an average token price of $0.431, representing a 61.7% realized loss. Related Reading: Dogecoin (DOGE) Bulls Aim to Clear $0.10: Will It Happen? Machi’s remaining 11.1 million FRIEND tokens had a 94.5% unrealized loss, worth $11.4 million. At the time of the report, the whale’s holdings were worth around $689,000. The cryptocurrency has recovered 32% from its ATL, briefly hitting the $0.09 mark earlier today, according to Coingecko data. As of this writing, FRIEND is trading at $0.0761, a 2.1% surge in the last 24 hours.

BTC is consolidating and might aim for more gains if it clears the $58,000 resistance. Bitcoin is rising from the $52,500 support zone. The price is trading above $55,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $55,300 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair is facing resistance near the $58,000 and $58,200 resistance levels in the near term. Bitcoin Price Starts Recovery Bitcoin price started a decent increase after it broke the $55,500 resistance zone. BTC gained pace and was able to clear the $56,200 resistance. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $55,300 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. The pair even spiked above the $58,000 resistance zone. A high was formed at $58,050 and the price is now consolidating gains. There was a minor decline below the $57,500 level.

Bitcoin is now trading above $55,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $57,500 level. The first key resistance is near the $58,000 level. A clear move above the $58,000 resistance might send the price further higher in the coming sessions. The next key resistance could be $58,500. A close above the $58,500 resistance might spark more upsides. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $60,000 resistance. Another Decline In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $58,000 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $56,750 level. The first major support is $55,500 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $52,569 swing low to the $58,050 high. The next support is now near the $53,500 zone. Any more losses might send the price toward the $52,600 support in the near term. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now losing pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $56,750, followed by $55,500.

Saylor’s Bitcoin Price Forecast Saylor, recognized for steering his company towards significant BTC investments to capitalize on its continuous growth, projected a mind-blowing future valuation for Bitcoin. Saylor boldly forecasted that the Bitcoin price could soar to an unprecedented $13 million per coin. During the interview, Saylor emphasized that Bitcoin represents just 0.1% of the global capital, envisioning a substantial increase to 7%. This monumental shift, he suggested, could propel Bitcoin to the remarkable $13 million mark by 2045. Related Reading: FET Teeters At Trendline: Will A Breakout Fuel A Run To $1.86? Saylor expounded on the cryptocurrency’s growth trajectory by delving into a detailed four-year calculation for the entire BTC market. With an average annual growth rate of 44%, potentially tapering to 40%, 35%, and eventually 30% in the coming years, Saylor outlined a compelling case for Bitcoin outperforming traditional financial indices. Saylor explained that he envisions BTC’s return outperforming the S&P by 8%, surpassing the market capitalization of the top 500 publicly traded companies in the US, underscoring its potential to disrupt global capital markets. During the interview, Saylor also took a moment to highlight the cryptocurrency’s unique proposition as an asset without counterparty risk. Contrary to popular belief that associates Bitcoin with high-risk investments, Saylor posited that BTC represents a safe haven for risk-averse people, emphasizing the desire for security and stability in investment choices. Market Direction And Support Levels Delving into the current state of the BTC market, crypto analyst Doctor Profit recently released a report to assess future price movements for the leading crypto. The report poses a crucial question: will the market continue to decline, or is a breakout to the upside imminent? Drawing parallels to past scenarios, Doctor Profit emphasizes the dangers of waiting for an elusive lower price point, citing a past instance when Bitcoin hovered at $16,000 in 2022, defying expectations of a drop to $10,000. Central to Doctor Profit’s analysis is the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) position, currently trailing 2% below the market price of $55,400, indicating a potential opportunity for traders to capitalize on potential recovery for the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Avalanche (AVAX) Ready To Target $28: Investors Expect A Reversal In addition, the analyst highlights a second support level 10% below the current price at $48,000, which could act as a barrier to further declines below this point, as it proved key during the August 5 crash that saw BTC plummet to $49,000. Addressing prevailing sentiments of pessimism and calls for a retreat to $40,000 levels, Doctor Profit offers a nuanced perspective, reminding investors of historical patterns post-Bitcoin Halving events. With the most recent Halving occurring in April, Doctor Profit contends that the market is well within the typical timeframe for Bitcoin’s parabolic surges, typically observed 10-12 months post-Halving. While the current sideways movement near the all-time high may evoke fear, Doctor Profit asserts that this phase is a natural part of the market cycle, distinct from the exuberance characterizing previous peaks.

The multi-signature wallet that got $ETH from @VitalikButerin is on a selling streak! After receiving 3,800 $ETH ($9.99M) from Vitalik on Aug 9 and 30, it’s been cashing out, selling 760 $ETH for 1.835M $USDC at ~$2,414 per ETH. The latest sale happened just 21 hours ago.… pic.twitter.com/ELcjpPSg4K — Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) September 9, 2024 The recent sale was made just 21 hours ago and has become a part of a streak of aggressive liquidations that have sparked speculations in the crypto community. Buterin was even accused of “dumping” his ETH holdings, which he always publicly denied, claiming that funds go to support development in the Ethereum ecosystem and philanthropy. While he has been reassuring, the continuous sales from wallets attributed to him have greatly contributed to increased bearish sentiment among investors. Broader Market Implications This selling is not a one-man activity carried out by Buterin; Ethereum Foundation is also notorious for offloading huge quantities of ETH. According to reports, it has sold over 3,066 ETH this year alone. Such sustained sales have raised questions about the whole Ethereum market’s health. According to analysts, sales such as these, together with large holder store reductions, have made life tough for ETH, struggling to hold its value. Besides Buterin’s sell-offs, one of the largest Ethereum whales liquidated a total of 28,554 ETH in cash in order to pay back his debt on Aave, a decentralized borrowing platform. That amount translates into approximately $64.4 million. This further added to the ETH sell-off pressure, making things even more complicated for ETH in the market. These cumulative activities have stirred talks that this aggressive ETH sell-off might cause ETH to plunge even below $2,000 if it proceeds this way.

Just 10 minutes ago, the #EthereumFoundation sold 450 $ETH for 1.029M $DAI. In total, they’ve sold 550 $ETH ($1.28M) at an average price of $2,324 in the past 4 days.

According to Aya Miyaguchi, executive director of the Ethereum Foundation, one requirement is the need to convert portions of the ETH it holds into stablecoins like DAI to cover certain financial obligations. This casts a shadow on the Ethereum community, as to where this could lead in the long run. Though the idea of Buterin and the Foundation could be genuinely valid, this dumping perception plays a significant role in investor perception. With this action, the market would respond to such withdrawals, and recovery or fall in ETH value is something the stakeholders keenly await.
