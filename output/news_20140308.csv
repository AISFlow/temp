42376939,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6vEx9,1394290065,Why The Bitcoin Industry Must Recognise Its Responsibilities,"Michael Jackson is a software engineer, entrepreneur and venture capital investor at Mangrove Capital Partners. He is also the former COO of Skype.    The most significant issue affecting the adoption of cybercurrencies is the safety of bitcoin holdings.  This is a fundamental deficiency of what is a software-defined asset, totally accessible instantaneously and online. In short, bitcoin’s very characteristics make it too easily accessible for criminals.  Last week we saw Mt. Gox cease to exist, this week Flexcoin. Both closures caused by errors in the companies’ systems, but with likely no recourse for their customers.  We will see more companies go under in this way, without a doubt. So if bitcoin is to widely adopted, the customer must be better protected.  Consumer protection  With existing currencies, you know that if a bank goes down, you are protected and will likely be refunded. In this case, you can say, the balances in the bank (which are effectively virtual too) are zeroed and then reissued by the central bank.  There exist other examples of consumer protection too. In the case of the travel industry, operators pay into a central pool that can be used for compensation in the event of a travel company collapsing. Those that pay into the pool are able to use the consumer protection badge, giving consumers the assurance they need to pay up front for their holidays.  Industry-backed consumer protection schemes are not new. In order to ensure consumer protection and regain trust, we need a similar scheme for digital currencies. By working together to define the criteria for accepting businesses into the scheme and sufficiently vetting each business, the same could be done for bitcoin.  Traceable coins  Of course, some environments are simpler than others. Charter holidays are relatively straightforward while bitcoin is, in practice, much more complex.  The protocol means that while it is easy enough to prove that you own a bitcoin, it is much harder to prove that the original bitcoin has disappeared and that a refund is therefore due.  Bitcoins held by Mt. Gox have seemingly disappeared, but they may still reappear. If this happens, perhaps what is required is a central body to return these bitcoins to Mt. Gox customers.  Some may argue that bitcoin is an ideology as much as a product – an ideology that would be totally destroyed if a governing body was given the power to control it.  Case study  However, the Internet itself has proven huge decentralized projects can be workable. If there are disputes regarding Internet governance or protocols, they can be escalated so that decisions are made for the greater good of the Internet.  In this case, this is possible because the web is such a large, diverse entity with no single self-interest.  Just now, it is not clear where the responsibility lies and it is important that the open-source nature of bitcoin is preserved – where the only self-interests are those that are building applications and services on top of the cryptocurrency.  The Bitcoin Foundation could be a good option – it has the right structure. With many of those involved having significant self-interests – half of them own exchanges of their own – this could be a good thing, as they will be motivated to regain the trust of bitcoin users.  New challenges  As is often the case with bitcoin, asking one question raises many more. Yet while there is still so much to be worked out, many of the challenges arising are not ones that haven’t been overcome before.  Similarly, there are many other technologies that were once unproven or unpopular, but are now multi-billion-dollar industries. It’s clear, however, that it will require effort, investment and trust between the various different components to take bitcoin forward.  Without renewed effort to gain consumer trust, this industry may die before it even reaches childhood. All bitcoin companies need to collect a levy, used to compensate unfortunate consumers. Some would call this a tax. Maybe bitcoin isn’t so far from the real world after all.

42397407,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAb4S1K,1394286650,Why Isn’t Your Business Accepting Bitcoin?,"Arianna is a bitcoin enthusiast and investor, who organizes a bitcoin meetup group in New York.  Bitcoin has been blowing up the news lately, mostly with bad press stemming from Mt. Gox’s recent collapse.  If you’re a business owner who is considering accepting the digital currency, this may be causing heart palpitations. Despite the temporary market unrest, there are huge opportunities for merchants to benefit from accepting bitcoin – I’ve outlined a few below.  Cost  Credit card fees usually run around 2 to 3%, which can make a considerable dent in the profits of businesses operating on low margins. With bitcoin, you can pay substantially lower fees (~1%) without needing a huge volume of transactions as leverage with the credit card company.  And that’s only if you transfer your money back into local currency – if you keep it in bitcoin, you can essentially avoid fees altogether.  It’s true that as your business scales, you can negotiate lower fees from existing credit-card companies. But let’s be honest: if you’re an entrepreneur, do you really want to spend your time haggling over a fraction of a percent with a rep in a call center on the other side of the planet? Didn’t think so.  There’s nothing quaint about it. You’re trying to build a company, and this isn’t a Moroccan spice market.  If you’re using a service like PayPal, you’re generally being charged a fixed rate of $0.30 per transaction, plus a percentage transaction fee based on volume. Bitcoin enables peer to peer (or individual to merchant) transactions on a very small scale, making micropayments much more viable than they previously had been, and transactions can be completed for less than half of the cost.  Let’s take a simple example in which you have a business with an annual revenue of $1m. Your credit card processor currently charges you 2% per transaction, or $20,000. If you switch to a bitcoin payment processor, say Coinbase or BitPay, you can get very close to 1%. You just cut your bill in half, and saved $10,000 by essentially doing nothing.  I can think of a lot of things I’d like to do with $10,000, and giving it to a credit card company isn’t one of them. Personally, I think it’s a toss up between a hobbit home or a water thrusting jet bike.  Safety from exchange rate risk  There’s no question that bitcoin has been volatile. It still is, and it would be shocking if it weren’t – very few big ideas reach maturity in a span as short as five years.  Personally, I view dips in price as opportunities to buy more, but if the possibility that your money could be worth half as much tomorrow keeps you up at night, that’s understandable. The delightful thing is that you needn’t actually hold any of the bitcoin you receive as payment. Most merchants who currently accept it set prices in their local currency and get paid in their local currency. Voilà!  Bitcoin operates as the “payment rails” – it’s the medium through which the transaction takes place, but you don’t have to expose yourself to any exchange risk.  International sales  Bitcoin transactions allow you to expand your markets to basically anywhere, so long as you’re willing to ship there (if you’re selling a physical product). You can accept payments from anywhere. Since there’s no intermediary bank, you don’t have to deal with waiting for ~3 days for the transaction to complete.  You can also avoid transfer limits and outrageous fees. As they currently stand, international transactions are a hassle, and there’s a great deal of room for bitcoin to help streamline the process (Timothy Lee of the Washington Post wrote a good piece on this).  No chargebacks  Chargebacks are quite a headache, and dealing with them can sap a considerable amount of time and energy that could be better spent growing your business. Bitcoin transactions are irreversible, which means that you needn’t worry about chargebacks.  Publicity  It’s still early enough in Bitcoin’s adoption that there are press stories to be written about “the first xxx” to accept bitcoin in a given city or town. Free press—Why not? This shouldn’t be your main rationale for taking bitcoin, but it’s something of an added bonus; leverage the exposure to expand your customer base.  These shoppers are also likely to be new customers who may be trying your product or service just because they can pay for it with bitcoin, and that’s your chance to hook them in via a great experience.  Ease of use  Bitcoin isn’t hard to deal with, and it’s only going to get easier. Please don’t buy into the argument that bitcoin is some complicated, mysterious thing and because you don’t fully understand it, you can’t use it.  I would posit that if you polled 1,000 college-educated Americans and asked them to describe in detail how a phone, TV, or refrigerator works, the majority wouldn’t be able to do so.  I certainly encourage everyone to become educated on bitcoin before taking the plunge, but a deep technical understanding of cryptographic hashing or how the block chain works is not necessary.  There are a number of companies that are already making it quite easy for you to accept bitcoin. Two that I have used personally, and therefore feel comfortable recommending, are Shopify and Coinbase.  If you use Shopify as a platform for your e-commerce sales, integration is a breeze. You can add it just as simply as you would Paypal or Visa. Coinbase is also super simple to integrate, and offers a solid degree of customization. As an added perk, merchants get the first $1,000,000 in transactions free of charge.  Sales  There is a myth in circulation that people tend to save bitcoin as an investment or a form of speculation rather than spending it, but there’s increasing evidence that it’s actually being used as a transactional currency.  This is not surprising, because as the number of merchants accepting it grows, people have more opportunities to spend it, which then leads more businesses to accept it, and so on. The bottom lefthand section of the infographic above shows an enormous increase in the number of people who spend bitcoin shortly after acquiring it.  People are willing to spend bitcoins – you might as well encourage them to do so at your business.  The number of companies offering B2B services build on the Bitcoin protocol is still fairly small, but there’s already a solid core of reputable, safe ones to choose from.  As the network effect widens and more people start accepting bitcoin, you’ll be increasingly able to benefit from the new currency, and even today there’s very little downside and a lot of upside to accepting Bitcoin. And after all, don’t you want to go buy that water thrusting jet bike?

42397399,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAb4RsT,1394282959,"Meet Roger Dickinson, The Man Behind California's Bill to Legalize Bitcoin","In the world of digital currency, misinformation spreads quickly, and there may be no greater recent example of this than California Assembly Bill 129, a piece of proposed legislation that has been heralded somewhat incorrectly as an already successful move by the state to ""legalize cryptocurrencies"".  Though, the bill would recognize digital currencies as ""lawful money"", it would also ensure the legal footing of additional forms of legal tender such as points and coupons, and is currently only halfway to becoming law.  Regardless, many in the digital currency community have high hopes that AB 129 and AB 786 (a bill passed in September that lowered capital requirements for money transmitters) signal that California will be among the more progressive US jurisdictions when it comes to digital currency.  With this in mind, CoinDesk set out to speak to California Assemblymember Roger Dickinson, the man who introduced both laws, to determine the extent to which the bills were crafted for the still-nascent industry.  However, if bitcoiners were hoping for a more progressive alternative to New York's Benjamin Lawsky, Dickinson doesn't exactly fit the mantle.  An advocate for a wide range of issues from job creation to climate change, Dickinson isn't exactly a bitcoin expert, and he indicates that the laws were not made specifically for virtual currencies. Rather, he said they're meant to address the sweeping changes that mobile and digital forms of payments are bringing in all their forms.  Dickinson explained:  ""It wasn't so much setting out to look at the issue of alternative currency, it was more evolutionary, leading into the breadth of the subject matter that suggested to us you couldn't ignore alternative currencies.""  A neutral approach  Dickinson described his state's approach to digital currency as ""neutral"", stating that the bills don't expressly advocate for the survival or demise of bitcoin.  Said Dickinson:  ""We're not trying to deter or advance the development of alternative currencies. We're trying to say that to the extent that alternative currencies are developed and in use, we will consider that to be a legally acceptable activity in California.""  Most notable is another thing AB 129 doesn't do, which is regulate alternative digital currencies. Dickinson indicated that any regulation would need to come from the California Department of Business Oversight and commissioner Jan Owen, who notably has worked for Apple and JPMorgan.  Dickinson did suggest that the issue may be further addressed by California, but stated that he believes digital currency regulation may need federal attention.  Personal exploration  A newcomer to the field, Dickinson said that he first learned of bitcoin when developing AB 786. At the time, the California Committee on Banking and Finance had begun looking broadly at digital payment systems, but he said that digital currencies stood out as ""intriguing and unavoidable"".  The lawmaker revealed he was surprised by the research, stating:  ""Even though there had been actually relatively recent regulation in 2009 establishing guidelines and requirements for money transmission, the practice of money transmission had evolved so rapidly over the course of three years that there was a need to revisit the subject.""  The result has been two bills attempting to bring guidelines up to speed. Yet, Dickinson doesn't see his legislation as part of the larger digital currency movement, saying he hasn't looked at how New York regulators are moving on the issue.  Further, he said he hasn't spoken to any local bitcoin businesses, despite California being a hotbed for innovation in the field.  The future of AB 129  The assemblyman said that though digital currencies have become a lightning rod for controversy, events regarding the now-bankrupt Japan-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, are unlikely to threaten the bill.  Though, Dickinson didn't rule out that another event could potentially compound the situation and raise additional questions before the end of March or April, when it is expected to be heard in the Senate.  ""I think in the end, people will see that what we're doing is simply that alternative currencies are something we need to recognize out there in the world, and that we shouldn't have some archaic prescription that applies.""  Even if bitcoin does collapse, Dickinson reasons, that's not to say that other digital currencies won't go on. For now, it seems, California is preparing for any and all conclusions.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/03/08/meet-roger-dickinson-the-man-behind-californias-bill-to-legalize-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b6ccf74e0a7cfa17c0d72c334db51152ba644662-1000x700.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
