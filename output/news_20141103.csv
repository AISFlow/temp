42377763,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73Uxt,1415052057,"Money20/20 Day 1: Regulators, Finance Giants Forecast Bitcoin's Future","Roughly 7,000 members of the financial technology and services industries are gathering at the illustrious Aria hotel in downtown Las Vegas for the Money20/20 conference this week.  The four-day event formally kicked off on 2nd November, bringing together nearly 1,000 chief executives, dozens of companies and one particular emerging technology that could reshape the careers and business models of everyone attending – bitcoin.  (Bit)coinWorld  , which focuses on the various opportunities and issues surrounding digital currencies, got off to a strong start on Sunday, with several sessions focused on consumer and security challenges as well as some of the promise offered by bitcoin and the technology underpinning it.  Those in town for the bitcoin track at Money20/20 heard bitcoin investors, entrepreneurs and federal law enforcement agencies share their thoughts and strategies on both promoting and securing digital currency for the future. Notably, the keynote speech was delivered by New York State Department of Financial Services superintendent Benjamin Lawsky.  Protecting consumers  The first panel, entitled 'Cryptocurrencies & Consumer Protection Issues', was moderated by Judie Rinearson, a partner at legal firm Bryan Cave. The panel consisted of Federal Trade Commission attorney Duane Pozza, Seven Advisory principal Constance Choi, Ripple Labs chief risk officer Greg Kidd and Hogan Lovells partner Veronica McGregor.  The panel, like others throughout the day, echoed a common argument – that regulators have no interest in squashing digital currency startups or outright preventing consumers from purchasing and using the technology.  Ripple’s Greg Kidd said that his company “would be happy if there were good regulations”, stating that such frameworks actually make it easier for businesses to expand and grow. He added that ultimately, bitcoin startups need to get the proper licensure if they plan on continuing to operate in the United States given the regulatory framework taking shape there.  “If you aren’t licensed, you aren’t in business,” he said.  Choi noted that the conversation taking place between regulators and bitcoin industry leaders is an important one, explaining that finding a balanced framework is “one of the pain points” creating problems today.  McGregor later commented that organizations like the US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) want to find solutions to these issues, explaining how the process currently underway will have an impact on regulations abroad.  “The international community is waiting on the US,” McGregor concluded.  Pozza helped end the session by explaining how agencies like the FTC are well aware of the benefits of digital currencies, and are only interested in fostering an environment in which lawful applications are not marred by fraudulent use cases.  He said:  “We talk about identifying the problems, but that doesn’t mean we’re not aware of the potential benefits, the consumer benefits.”  Criminal use of digital currencies  The day’s session on money laundering and fraud issues was notable for its participation by representatives from the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and US Department of Justice, as well as members from the security and bitcoin industries.  Manatt, Phelps & Phillips  partner Carol Van Cleef led the discussion, which included BitPay regulatory counsel Azba Habib; Catherine “Alden” Pelker, an analyst for the FBI’s Money Laundering Intelligence Unit; Kathryn Haun, assistant US attorney for the Justice Department’s Organized Crime Strike Force; and Scott Dueweke, director of identities and payments at Agilex Technologies.  Both Pelker and Haun spoke at length about the frequent use of digital currencies by online criminals for enterprises both large and small. Haun noted that today, the marketplaces for personal identities and credit cards function almost entirely on bitcoin and other digital currencies.  Haun explained:  “What we’re seeing is some of these organizations, including in the Eastern Bloc, companies that sell identities and sell credit card numbers will really only accept payment in digital currency. They aren’t interested in cash, wires – they’re really going for digital currency. We’re seeing that in the areas of child exploitation and pornography [as well].”  Pelker argued that the interest in digital currencies among online criminals reflects the broad interest among the money-using public in technologies like bitcoin and more use among businesses and consumers.  “But the natural consequence of that is that criminals – if they hear more and more about these systems – incidentally more of them will be interested in experimenting with them,” he said.  Habib revealed that BitPay has had to develop internal protocols to identify merchants trying to use their networks that ultimately prove to be fraudulent enterprises. She said that the company is working on automated systems for this purpose, and for now, manual practices and in-depth investigations is its main weapon against would-be fraudsters.  Following her comments, Haun noted that these practices are a welcome sign for federal investigators and that the government wants to see that kind of self-policing become more common.  Other topics covered during the panel included what companies can do to both identify whether or not they are the target of a federal investigation, and what they can do if and when that process occurs.  Pelker and Haun said that companies in the bitcoin space need to recognize the realities of their business, and this includes instituting a robust AML/KYC policy before being asked about it by federal regulators.  During a follow-up Q&A, Habib was asked what BitPay is doing in the wake of twin rulings released last week by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). She said the process is still ongoing, explaining:  “We looked at that ruling very closely. There are some open questions that we have engaged FinCEN with to try and gain clarity on a few nuances.”  The future of digital currencies  The session 'Building Bridges from Crypto to Legacy Financial Systems' focused on how the bitcoin industry could become more interconnected with the broader financial ecosystem. Davis Wright Tremaine associate Peter Luce utilized both his own questions and those from each of the panelists in parsing how the two industries could ever cooperate, if at all.  Participants included Bitcoin Foundation Regulatory Affairs Committee chairman and Blockchain global policy counsel Marco Santori; CoinX founder Megan Burton; ITC Financial Licenses general counsel Nicole Ibbotson; Xapo chief compliance officer Karsten Behrend; and Frank Mastrangelo, co-founder and president of Bancorp.  During the session, participants were asked to gauge the likelihood of banks working with digital currencies and the companies that service that emerging sector. Burton said that while challenging, the process can start if companies in the bitcoin sector are prepared to be as open and collaborative as possible.  She said:  “Our counteraction is simply education, bringing them into our environment, letting them audit us, let them look at our systems, walk them through a transaction and show how it mirrors the systems out there today.  Mastrangelo said that digital currency startups shouldn’t be worried about working with banking partners and financial institutions – assuming that they are willing to play within existing and yet-to-be developed regulatory and compliance frameworks.  “Our viewpoint is that one should come into the framework and operate as a fully licensed organization,” he said.  Pitfalls of block-chain technology  Panelists in the final crypto-themed talk of the day, 'Digital Securities and Bitcoin 2.0 Crowdsales, State Licensings & Overseas Structuring', looked to the new use cases being developed for block-chain technology and the pitfalls of doing so.  Panel members included Bitstamp general counsel George Frost; GoCoin co-founder and Bitcoin Foundation director Brock Pierce; Overstock.com general counsel Mark Griffin; Mark Smith, CEO and founder of MathMoney; and Perkins Coie partner J Dax Hansen.  The panel cast a broad view at the outset, looking at a regulatory development process on both the state and federal levels in the US that Frost called “a bit hysterical”. Other panelists echoed this sentiment, though Griffin said he was surprised that some regulators hadn’t taken a harsher approach from the outside.  A major topics of discussion was the controversy surrounding crypto 2.0 companies engaging in crowdsales that could be construed as distributing securities and investments.  Griffin noted that federal regulators could interpret existing statutes by saying that certain types of digital asset issuances count as investments, but he and others argued that the securities issuance sector needs to be innovative and that digital currency technology can lead the way, specifically in regards to issues around property rights.  Pierce added that companies that opt out of crowdsales as a means to raise capital may find themselves cut off from other channels of funding as a result. He cautioned companies considering this approach, commenting that only those who are doing ""extraordinarily well"" will be able to tap into more traditional means in the future.  Lawsky on BitLicense progress  During his keynote address, NYDFS superintendent Ben Lawsky outlined that his agency is trying to strike a fair balance between protecting New York consumers from fraud, while also providing the flexibility and breathing space required by developers in an emerging technology sector.  In addition to announcing the creation of a so-called transitional BitLicense framework, Lawsky outlined how regulators in his office both understand and respect that some digital currency startups will be more capable than others in meeting compliance and the associated costs.  ""It's a big issue [and] something we're working on,"" he said.  When asked whether or not he thinks crypto 2.0 applications should be treated similarly or brought under a new kind of legal framework. He said that work is being done in this area, and acknowledged the complexities of regulating non-financial actions that require microtransactions to take place.

42377754,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73Unp,1415050948,TeraExchange Brings Multisig Security to Bitcoin Derivatives Platform,"TeraExchange has announced a new partnership with bitcoin security firm BitGo, a deal both parties view as a step toward bringing traditional trading standards to the bitcoin industry.  The partnership, the companies said, will position TeraExchange as the only player in the bitcoin exchange industry to provide clients with the ability to collateralize bitcoin derivative trades.  BitGo will provide multi-signature block chain services for the USD/BTC swaps on TeraExchange's platform, and in turn, TeraExchange will provide its clients with multi-signature escrow accounts where neither party has authority to execute funds without the other's authorization.  TeraExchange said the integration with BitGo provides an alternative to the third-party custodianship model that pervades the bitcoin industry. Users will maintain a BitGo Enterprise account and establish multisig custodial wallets, while BitGo’s platform will hold deposited bitcoins as collateral for USD/BTC swaps recorded on the block chain.  BitGo CEO Will O'Brien told CoinDesk that, while common to the traditional financial world, such custodianship models have yet to permeate the bitcoin exchange sector, saying:  ""The model is not new to the financial world, to the swaps world, it’s not new to the executives at TeraExchange. [...] It’s new to the bitcoin industry and it’s finally catching up to what the financial world knows, which is separation of custodianship from exchange operation.""  Christian Martin, CEO and co-founder of TeraExchange, further positioned the deal as one that would open up new firsts for the bitcoin industry.  “Historically USD or other fiat currencies, US Treasuries and investment grade debt has been used to collateralize trading activity,"" he said. ""Now in addition to XBT being included in that menu of collateral – this is also the first time that the block chain is serving as the collateral repository for a regulated product on a regulated exchange.”  More choices for market participants  The news is the latest sign that TeraExchange is seeking to extend the appeal of its USD/bitcoin swaps to a more mainstream audience. The company became the first regulated US bitcoin derivatives trading platform this September, when it received regulatory approval from the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).  Martin said that the relationship with BitGo is driven by the company’s desire to provide its clients with added security for their trading activity.  “This allows market participants to transact knowing the counterparty to their trade is appropriately margined on trade date then throughout the lifecycle of the transaction until maturity and final cash flows,” said Martin.  TeraExchange believes its target audience for the offering will extend beyond traders, to bitcoin businesses that want to better manage their bitcoin finances to guard against volatility.  Gregory Simon, CFO and co-founder of Ribbit.me, said in a statement:  “The TeraExchange marketplace enables us to hedge our bitcoin price volatility risk, and BitGo’s service gives me the peace of mind that my company’s bitcoins are stored on the block chain with the industry’s best security technology and standards.”  New possibilities for bitcoin ecosystem  O'Brien sought to frame the announcement as one that provides evidence of how increased interest from the traditional finance industry will shape standards for bitcoin trading, and for how the industry itself is taking security more seriously in the wake of Mt Gox.  The CEO further suggested that his firm won TeraExchange's business due to its status as an early market player, suggesting that its technology, team and funding provided validation for its enterprise offerings.  ""These are veteran guys in the financial services sector and they know who to pick, so we’re finding more and more that our customers are reaching out to us through referrals from our existing customer base, because it’s a matter of: you want to choose a platform that you can scale on and that you can trust the service provider,"" he said.  However, he was gracious when acknowledging potential competitors who may be seeking to extend multsig technology to new verticals, welcoming the new competition from Coinbase, which introduced its consumer-facing Multisig Vault last week.  He concluded: ""I think multisig is absolutely a critical standard that every wallet, every service provider, every exchange needs to adopt.""

42395298,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASaH90,1415046056,PayPal Exec Leaves to Take Compliance Lead at Bitstamp,"PayPal chief compliance officer (CCO) Jean-Baptiste Graftieaux has revealed that he has left his current position at the global payments giant to join one of the largest bitcoin exchanges by USD trading volume, Bitstamp.  Graftieaux served as a director and CCO of PayPal’s Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) division for more than five years, starting in January 2009. Prior to joining PayPal, Graftieaux was also a CCO at online ticket marketplace StubHub. Today was Graftieaux's final day at PayPal.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Graftieaux framed his latest endeavor as one that allows him to pursue his fascination with the bitcoin ecosystem as a full-time career.  Graftieaux said:  “I have been attracted by the culture of Bitstamp and also by its people. The Bitstamp employees that I have met are committed, optimistic and passionate and we share the same passion for the bitcoin ecosystem.”  He further reported that he is a bitcoin user, and that he has been following the ecosystem for a few years.  Bitstamp is one of the more well-funded bitcoin exchanges internationally, garnering a $10m investment from Pantera Capital in 2013, though it has seen its position in the global USD trading market slip in recent weeks amid increased volumes on rival China-based exchanges.  Bitstamp’s regulatory ambassador  Graftieaux suggested that his day-to-day activities at Bitstamp would entail leading the exchange’s compliance program. Perhaps more notably, however, his duties will also include reaching out to engage relevant regulators in discussion about how the exchange can best move forward with business objectives.  Graftieaux said he would look to “preserve the interests of the bitcoin ecosystem” during these conversations, and that he will seek to actively engage government representatives in talks that allow him to present Bitstamp’s position on issues.  He went on to illustrate how both he and his new company would work together on a shared goal, albeit different objectives.  “My role will consist of enabling the Bitstamp business expansion, where Bitstamp will maximise compliance with regulatory requirements and user experience,” he added.  Bitcoin proving draw for payments veterans  The news that Graftieaux will leave PayPal to join a bitcoin startup comes at a time when a growing number of his peers are beginning to consider the industry.  While far from dominating the mainstream payments conversation, high-profile members of that community, including former Visa exec and CCO Tim Byun, ex-VeriFone CFO Bob Dykes and former Obopay CEO Carol Realini have made their interest in bitcoin as a disruptive payments technology clear.  A similar trend can also be see in the financial industry, where members of Wall Street firms are beginning to look to the bitcoin industry as one that could provide lucrative, long-term opportunity.  When asked how his past work would help him meet the objectives of his new job, he added:  “When it comes to anti-money laundering, understanding the package of Financial Action Task Force (FATF) recommendations, Basel guidance and regulations serves as the basis for driving the development of that part of the compliance program.”  Bitstamp renews emphasis on compliance  The hiring also comes at a time when Bitstamp is seeking to emphasize its willingness to cooperate with global regulators as the attention of this group continues to shift toward the bitcoin industry.  For example, Bitstamp announced on 16th October that it would potentially hand over funds in user accounts to relevant government authorities should users fail to verify their accounts within 28 days. The decision was widely discussed by its customers, who had mixed reactions to the news.  Bitstamp has made other areas of its business a priority as well, this week announcing a new graphical trading interface to improve its user experience. The move perhaps signals that it is responding to increasing competition from China, even as it focuses on regulation in its home market.

Marc Andreessen  , Ben Davenport, former American Online CEO Barry Schuler, Rothenberg Ventures, Maven II, Kilowatt Capital are among those that invested in the fund.  Boost founder and chief Adam Draper told CoinDesk that the fund’s investors are evidence of a trend of quality investors becoming drawn to the bitcoin space.  “Our goal is always to provide the companies with the best network to make their company the best it can be,” he said. “Our investors are keeping with that vision, and can provide experience and guidance and brand recognition for the startups.”  Draper added:  “Our focus over the past three years has been to find the most innovative people starting world changing companies. We are interested in everything from enterprise to rockets, 3D printing to bitcoin.""  'Repairing' bitcoin  Draper said that bitcoin is in ""repair mode"", meaning that five years have passed of “playing with an incredible toy”, but that now is the time to fill in its gaps and fix its problems.  Scale, usability and security problems are all areas for opportunity in the bitcoin space, he said, adding that he believes there will be an increasing number of companies that emerge to build on these concerns. Fraper cited HashRabbit and BlockCypher as two such companies already addressing problems in the space.  He said:  “Other than that, companies that are focused on the block chain are high on our list, and then services surrounding bitcoin that support the ecosystem, but can also translate to other industries – these companies mostly are based in compliance.”  Draper pointed to Hedgy, Pylon and BlockScore as examples of such startups – all companies in Boost’s fourth 'tribe', which debuted at last week's Demo Day following the completion of the California-based accelerator's fourth session. In all 15 bitcoin-focused companies took part.  Family tradition  Notably, Draper’s grandfather and father, Bill and Tim Draper, also took part in the latest investment round, making Boost the first fund backed by three generations of venture capitalists.  Tim Draper, the noted VC and Draper Fisher Jurvetson partner, is famously bullish on bitcoin and made the winning bid for the 30,000 Silk Road bitcoins auctioned by the US government back in July.  Draper founded Boost VC in early 2011. Since then 69 companies have been accelerated via its program, 95% of which are still in business.

42426150,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIjHxh,1415026855,Markets Weekly: Price Slump Continues While Transactions Rise,"The bitcoin price continued its decline this week, deepening losses that began last week. However, fundamentals suggest there may be reason for optimism in the long-run.  Bitcoin was trading at $352 at the start of last week, close to its high for the period. It dropped to a low of $320 on Saturday. It closed the week at $325, losing $27 over the seven days. That's a drop of about 8%.  To put the latest price movement in context, last week's Markets Weekly reported the Bitcoin Price Index at a high of nearly $390, before losing $40 over the week. The last two weeks, then, has seen the price of bitcoin drop some 17%.  The bitcoin price has fallen by 58% since the start of the year. It hit a high of $951 on 6th January and is at its lowest level for the year this week, according to daily closing prices on the BPI. The lowest price recorded this year was $286 on 29th September, although it rebounded to close at $319 that day.  Total transactions spike  Amid the red candlesticks and declining bitcoin price, some market participants see reason for cheer. Barry Silbert, who invests in companies in the digital currency space through his vehicle Bitcoin Opportunity Corp, tweeted that bitcoin had crossed a milestone threshold of 50 million transactions last week.    Bitcoin has now been used in 50,000,000 transactions https://t.co/LbYNroU8zQ      — Barry Silbert (@barrysilbert) October 30, 2014      The total number of bitcoin transactions has almost doubled from 26 million a year ago.  Total transactions, however, may not give a complete picture of bitcoin adoption. Breaking down the number of transactions for each day may be a more accurate indicator of the robustness of bitcoin activity.  By this measure, bitcoin use is steadily increasing. Daily transactions is close to an all-time high of 98,921 transactions on 28th November. It hit 93,667 transactions on 29th October.  Regulatory mixed messages  The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) published more detailed guidance for companies dealing in bitcoin in the United States this week. The latest guidance was largely seen as a dampener to the activities of bitcoin companies.  Observers believe the new guidance means FinCEN has increased the regulatory barriers for bitcoin firms, suggesting that merchant processors are considered money transmitters. This would require these firms to obtain licenses at both the federal and state levels, a potentially expensive and time-consuming process.  Speaking of state regulators, Ben Lawsky, New York state's top financial regulatory official, keynoted the Money 20/20 conference in Las Vegas this week. Lawsky, who's spear-heading the 'BitLicense' regulatory framework in his state, made more positive noises about proposal. He said startups might get a watered down version of the license – a 'Transitional BitLicense' – that wouldn't put them out of business before they had even begun.  About 7,000 members of the payments, technology and retailing industries will have access to Money 20/20's series of talks on digital currencies, called 'Bitcoin World', which the conference is running for the first time. Announcements from merchants or payment processors could be made over duration of Bitcoin World on Tuesday and Wednesday.  Trading volume trends  Total trading volume improved marginally week-on-week by 6%. A total of 1.97 million bitcoins changed hands this week compared to 1.86 million in the previous seven days.  On the individual exchanges front, ANXBTC, BTC China and Bitfinex showed the largest increases in trading volume in BTC terms. Hong Kong-based Bitfinex is making a strong bid to become the fourth-largest exchange by trading volume outside the 'big three' exchanges on mainland China, reporting a mid-week surge of 56,274 coins trade on 30th October.  Indeed, one rapidly growing exchange is said to be preparing an overhaul of its systems to accommodate the increased trading volume it's experiencing.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Joon Ian Wong,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/11/03/markets-weekly-price-slump-continues-while-transactions-rise,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6d9d7687809439e39d5f4b3f641542a01968ebe3-1456x975.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42426147,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIjHvh,1415025012,Bitfinex Prepares for Bitcoin Trading Growth with New Back-End,"Bitfinex has announced that it will seek to overhaul the back-end of its trading exchange through a new partnership with AlphaPoint.  One of the top bitcoin exchanges by USD trading volume, Bitfinex is currently in beta, yet it already offers a number of advanced trading features including margin trading and tradeable mining contracts.  The Hong Kong-based exchange said the partnership will help ensure its platform can scale to meet the growing international demand for bitcoin trading.  Although notable for Bitfinex, the partnership also represents arguably the first major deal for AlphaPoint, the bitcoin exchange solution provider that launched earlier this month with $1.35m in funding. AlphaPoint’s partners to date have been mostly smaller, regional exchanges such as Canada’s Cointrader, Norway’s BitcoinsNorway and Latin America’s meXBT.  Speaking to CoinDesk, AlphaPoint CEO Vadim Telyatnikov said the partnership would add credibility to the company’s offerings and boost the appeal of its solutions.  He explained:  “Bitfinex did its diligence and decided that our platform is secure and scalable enough to grow with their needs. I definitely think that’s going to help the conversations we’re having with startups, but especially with institutions.”  Telyatnikov suggested that AlphaPoint has been engaging with traditional Wall Street firms, many of whom are taking a deeper look at the opportunities in the bitcoin space.  Seeking enterprise solutions  Launched in 2013, Bitfinex's trading volumes have grown rapidly, as attested by data from Bitcoinity (see chart). The exchange has grown from facilitating less than 10,000 BTC in trades per day in April to between 30,000–50,000 BTC per day in October.  Bitfinex indicated that it chose to partner with AlphaPoint because the firm had made a convincing argument its solution could be more robust than one developed in-house.  “Once we had the opportunity to look under the hood of the AlphaPoint platform, we found them to have the best enterprise back-end solution to address our needs for the present and the future,” Bitfinex's VP of business development Josh Rossi said.  In particular, Bitfinex cited the ability for AlphaPoint to help it process a million transactions per second as a key factor in the decision making, citing the sometimes rapid increase in trading that can occur on the exchange.  “We can support multiple coins, not just bitcoin, but any digital currency,” Telyatnikov added. “We also support all the transitional APIs and gateways that Wall Street is used to using.”  User experience consistency  AlphaPoint’s Telyatnikov indicated that while the partnership has been announced, the actual back-end migration of the Bitfinex exchange has yet to be completed.  “The migration does take some time and we’re in the middle of that,” he said. “I don’t want to give specific dates, but we definitely expect it to happen in the next month or two.”  Founder Joe Ventura provided additional details, noting that it will now seek to migrate Bitfinex’s database to its platform.  “For a short period of time, we’ll be running both systems in parallel to make sure everything is functioning as normal,” he explained. “Then, we’ll do a full transition and unplug their back-end and everything will ride on our back-end.”  Ventura said that Bitfinex customers shouldn’t notice any changes during the transition process, as user interface will remain the same.  “It should be seamless,” he concluded.

42395301,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASaHBx,1415019632,Circle Launches Mobile Apps for iOS and Android,"UPDATE (5th Nov, 23:25 GMT): Circle has confirmed its mobile apps are US-only for the moment, but that international versions are ""imminent"" – along with support for more languages and currencies.  Bitcoin-based consumer finance company Circle has released native apps for both iOS and Android platforms, aiming to bring as many features of its online platform as possible to the mobile world.  Unlike other mobile bitcoin wallets out there, 'Circle for Bitcoin' integrates with banks and credit card accounts to allow both deposits and withdrawals. There are also the more familiar bitcoin wallet features like send and request money, and transactions via QR code.  Circle  CEO Jeremy Allaire told CoinDesk the focus was less about bitcoin and more about using money, adding:  ""We also emphasize users' local currency in transactions, which we think is important to widespread adoption for payments.""     Requests by email  The apps allow users to send payment requests via email. If a recipient is already a Circle user, they can complete the request with a one-click action from the message (which is also a website feature).  If the recipient is a bitcoin user, but does not have a Circle account, they can send funds to a bitcoin address provided. Alternatively, they have the option to join Circle and complete the payment that way.  Users of compatible iOS devices will also have the option to secure their accounts with Apple's Touch ID fingerprint reader.  Otherwise, the critical features are generally identical on both iOS and Android devices, with just a few minor differences. Circle's intention is to provide consistent functionality across the two mobile platforms and the web version.  Circle demonstrated beta versions of the apps at an event in mid-September, and officially went live with its international web-based bitcoin brokerage and payments service later that month.  Although the company's aim is to make bitcoin as familiar to digital currency newcomers as possible, Allaire cautioned the market was in its very early stages and still faced a lot of hurdles to be useful to all.  ""We think we're moving things in the right direction, but by no means do we think that these products are ready for the masses.""  Circle, however, certainly hopes it is making progress at this goal, he said.  Circle's entire platform is free to use, available to all customers around the world and in seven languages. Deposits in its accounts are 100% insured. Circle for Bitcoin will be available on Apple's iOS App Store and the Google Play store from today.

42426134,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIjHTh,1415014779,Added Regulatory Oversight Wins Unisend New Banking Partner,"Unisend has announced it will once again enable Argentina-based users to fund exchange activities through bank transfers.  The news comes roughly three months after the Argentinian bitcoin exchange abruptly lost its accounts with previous banking partners Banco Santander Rio and Banco Galicia, thereby limiting the company’s service in what is arguably Latin America’s most prominent bitcoin market.  Founder and CTO Pablo Esterson said the announcement was the end result of months of effort by the seven-person company, which has needed to apply for new accounts while putting a new emphasis on compliance with local regulators.  Esterson told CoinDesk:  “We integrated our platform to the Administración Federal de Ingresos Públicos [AFIP, the Argentinian tax agency] to send online reports about our activity using their API. All this is intended to make our operations clearer to banks and government agencies so they know what's going on and learn about our process and the way we're working.”  Unisend is now working with Banco de la Provincia de Buenos Aires – a state-backed bank, unlike the exchange's previous, private partners.  Since August, Argentina-based customers of the exchange have needed to fund their accounts through payment processing services. However, due to the high fees, Esterson said volumes at the country’s only order-book exchange have declined.  Increased oversight necessary  Esterson acknowledged in the interview that some Unisend users may be anti-government or anti-regulation and therefore wary about the integration with the AFIP.  However, Esterson suggested that the bank transfer method naturally appeals to individuals who acknowledge that their transactions may be monitored due to the regulated nature of fiat money in Argentina.  Esterson argued that those who have nothing to hide from government authorities shouldn’t take issue with the exchange’s decision, and further stated that he believes Unisend has a responsibility to help prevent illicit activity on its platform.  “As an exchange working with banks in Argentina, it is our responsibility to know our customers and to check the sources of the money being deposited into our exchange,” he said.  In addition to Argentina, Unisend launched in Mexico this September. To date its operations in this market have been comparably smooth.  Slow recovery expected  Today's announcement will also coincide with a new public relations push by the exchange, which has used local bitcoin social media sites and its email lists to encourage former users to return to the platform.  Esterson estimates that Unisend has 1,700 registered users and believes that many who have left the exchange will return. Still, he cautioned that it will take time to win back customers who may have migrated to bitcoin brokerage solutions.  Esterson added:  ""We will continue working hard to improve our services to slowly grow the transactions and volume in our exchange to what it used to be.""

42426136,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIjHbh,1414980050,Lawsky: NYDFS Considering Transitional BitLicense for Small Startups,"The New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) has announced that it is considering creating a special type of transitional BitLicense tailored to the needs of small businesses and startups.      The special licensure would allow bitcoin startups that meet certain criteria to operate within a more flexible regulatory framework for a yet-to-be-determined period of time, during which examinations of the business would be conducted.      The formal announcement of the NYDFS’ shift in strategy came during superintendent Benjamin M Lawsky's keynote speech on the opening day of Money 20/20, an ongoing five-day conference to feature talks from other industry luminaries including Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire and Blockchain CEO Nicolas Cary, among others.      In prepared remarks, Lawsky framed his department’s decision as one that illustrates how the NYDFS is seeking to respond to criticisms it has faced from the bitcoin community during the regulation’s 90-day comment period.      Lawsky said:    “One issue that we heard about consistently throughout the entire comment period is a concern about the compliance costs of regulation on new or fledgling virtual currency enterprises ... There has to be a way for startups to start up and play by the rules without getting crushed by huge compliance costs.”    In addition, Lawsky announced that the NYDFS may also seek to designate a “small group of specialized examiners” that will oversee such companies and their license applications, and thereby help ease the burden for startups.    Determining factors    Lawsky went on to present a list of factors that the NYDFS may consider when deciding whether to grant its proposed Transitional BitLicense.      Factors included:    Anticipated transactional and business volume  The mitigating risk controls already in place (eg: a bond or other insurance)  The nature and scope of the applicant’s business  Whether the entity is registered with FinCEN as a money services business.    The NYDFS’ latest proposal, Lawsky added, was inspired by the host of letters his agency has received from the bitcoin community. Further, he remarked that he hopes the letters will soon be made public.      Lawsky remarked that he hopes the NYDFS will be able to “strike a balance” between maintaining consumer protections and enabling the bitcoin industry to grow.      “Our hope that innovative new companies – committed to doing things the right way – will want to do a lot of business in New York, the financial capital of the world,” he said.    Commitment to consumers    Throughout the remarks, Lawsky stressed that despite easing the burden for bitcoin startups, his department remains committed to protecting consumers from illicit activity.      “We cannot turn away from the vital task of preventing money laundering – which facilitates sometimes unspeakable crimes,” Lawksy said, striking a similar refrain as at the NYDFS BitLicense hearings this January.      Lawsky stressed that digital currency startups that engaged in misconduct would face significant penalties, and that all firms operating under any version of the license would have to meet strong anti-money laundering (AML) and capital standards. However, Lawsky suggested that there is a potential for startups to outsource such compliance risks, adding:    “We have faced similar issues among the smaller, community banks we regulate. We recognize that if a financial firm has 12 employees – and nine of them are compliance officers – that is not a winning business model.""    Lawsky concluded by suggesting that the latest BitLicense revision would soon be made available for public comment and that a final version would be released this January.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/11/03/lawsky-nydfs-considering-transitional-bitlicense-for-small-startups,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1d12f7d258d44802c57bdf25c5bd2353ca757ff9-648x484.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
