42378392,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7i6Bp,1447967471,Ben Bernanke: Bitcoin Has 'Serious Problems',"Former Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke offered both muted praise and criticism when discussing bitcoin in a new interview, suggesting that government oversight of blockchain transactions could counter perceived risks.  Speaking toQuartz, Bernanke said that bitcoin is ""interesting from a technological point of view"", pointing to wider developments in the emerging payments space.  ""We're in a world where the payments system is evolving quickly and new approaches to managing payments are proliferating, and some of the ideas around bitcoin will no doubt be useful in doing that,"" he told the publication.  Yet the compliments stopped there, as Bernanke continued:  ""But I think bitcoin itself has some serious problems. The first is that it hasn’t shown to be a stable source of value. Its price has been highly volatile and it hasn’t yet established itself as a widely accepted transactions medium.""  He went on to suggest that government officials might look to boost oversight of digital currency activity, highlighting the perceived anonymity of bitcoin and pointing to its role as ""a vehicle for illicit transactions, drug selling or terrorist financing or whatever"".  ""And you know, governments are not happy to let that activity happen, so I suspect that there will be oversight of transactions done in bitcoin or similar currencies and that will reduce the appeal,"" he said in the interview.  The comments come more than two years after Bernanke, in a letter to Congress, highlighted the possible benefits and risks of digital currencies.  Image Credit: Albert H.

42378384,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7i631,1447953870,Bitcoin Payroll Startup Bitwage Raises $760k,"Bitcoin payroll startup Bitwage has wrapped up a period of fundraising, bringing in a total of $760,000 raised between a group of investors including Orange Telecom, Draper Associates and participants on the BnkToTheFuture.com investment platform.  On Monday, Bitwage closed a $200,000 funding round on BnkToTheFuture.com, shares from which were initially purchased by Max Keiser's Bitcoin Capital fund.  The bitcoin payroll startup has spent the past few months raising funds, a process that included participation from Cloud Money Ventures, the venture arm of Uphold, and Saeed Amidi, an investor in Bitwage who was also an early supporter of now-billion dollar companies like PayPal and Dropbox. During that time Bitwage joined the Silicon Valley-based startup accelerator run by Orange, the major French telecommunications group.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Bitwage founder Jonathan Chester said that the company plans to use the funds to build out its infrastructure, with a particular focus on expanding to the European market. Further, he said the Bitwage team plans to expend resources on enhancing its user experience to make it simpler for client integrations to take place.  ""What we're doing with these funds is streamlining that process,"" he said.  Those who took part in Bitwage’s recent funding efforts pointed to its real-world use and potential to kickstart bitcoin usage as reasons for getting involved.  ""I think in this case we are betting on the jockeys and not the horse,"" Keiser told CoinDesk.  BnkToTheFuture.com CEO Simon Dixon said that the Bitwage funding effort drew significant interest from contributors on the platform.  ""Bitwage is bringing the power of Bitcoin to international payroll and it was one of the most popular pitches on BnkToTheFuture.com,"" he said.  Julian Lee, a partner for Cloud Money Ventures, commented that the firm got involved following its previous work with Bitwage, adding:  ""Working with Uphold, BitWage is able to solve a number of pressing problems faced by multinationals centered around international payroll and money flow, benefitting from increased speed, greater transparency and significantly lower costs.""  Orange Telecom, Draper Associates and Saeed Amidi did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

42378391,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7i6AZ,1447944159,"Wells Fargo, ING Among 5 New Banks Partnering With R3","BNP Paribas, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, ING, MacQuarie and Wells Fargo are the latest major financial institutions to partner with distributed ledger startup R3CEV.  With the announcement, R3 brings the number of financial institutions participating in its stealth initiatives to 30, with other major names including Bank of America, BNY Mellon, Citi, HSBC and Morgan Stanley, among others.  Though details on the project are scarce, project representatives have indicated R3 is seeking to build what it calls a “global fabric of finance”, or a blockchain or distributed ledger system tailored to the needs of the banking community and crafted with its input.  To date, R3 has emerged as the arguable leader of a new pack of startups seeking to adapt the technology underpinning the bitcoin network to enterprise financial use cases, with others including Digital Asset Holdings and Symbiont competing for a similar clientele.  In addition to the new partnerships, R3 announced a number of personnel appointments.  Bitcoin developer Mike Hearn has been tapped by the R3 team to be its chief platform officer, while James Carlyle, a former chief engineer of banking architecture at Barclays, was named its chief engineer.  Tim Swanson and Richard Gendal Brown, two of the company's advisors, have now been formally brought on in full-time roles. Swanson was announced as R3's head of research, while Brown will serve as chief technology officer.  For more on the banks participating in the program, read our full list of those involved here.

42378387,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7i66n,1447936209,European Union to Crack Down on Bitcoin After Paris Attacks,"European Union (EU) countries will seek a crackdown on bitcoin during crisis talks tomorrow, in the wake of last week's Paris attacks, Reuters reports.      A draft document seen by Reuters said that EU member countries were planning to crack down on digital currencies and anonymous payment systems made via pre-paid cards in a bid to curb terrorism financing.      EU justice and interior ministers who will attend the meeting are expected to urge the European Commission to come up with measures to ""strengthen controls of non-banking payment methods such as electronic/anonymous payments and virtual currencies and transfers of gold, precious metals, by pre-paid cards,"" said the draft conclusion of the meeting seen by Reuters.    Earlier this week  , the European Commission said that it was assessing whether bitcoin or any other digital currencies could serve to finance terrorist activity and money laundering as part of a new security report.  The news comes after a report published by the UK government last month deemed that digital currencies posed a ""low"" risk for both money laundering and terrorism financing.

According to a Computerworld report  , the bank – which recently partnered with distributed ledger startup R3CEV and has experimented with Ripple's technology – has teamed up with Coala, a research organisation which had already organised an international series of blockchain events.  David Whiteing, CIO at Commonwealth Bank, said:  ""Blockchain has the potential to transform banking in the way that the Internet transformed how we buy music and watch movies ... It's an exciting time in the development of this technology and our involvement means Commonwealth Bank is set to be at the forefront of this in Australia for the benefit of our customers.""  The workshops are expected to explore blockchain technology, any regulatory issues and its potential within the country.  Speakers include  Joi Ito, director of MIT Media Lab, who will discuss the role played by universities in facilitating innovation and Lawrence Lessig, the Roy L. Furman Professor of Law at Harvard Law School.    The news comes after reports suggested the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) confirmed that it was investigating the actions of banks in the country, after they reportedly closed down the accounts of various bitcoin businesses.
