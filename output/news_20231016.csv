Earlier Monday, Bitcoin's price surged toward $30,000 due to a post on X (formerly Twitter) by the crypto news site Cointelegraph of a spot bitcoin ETF approval, causing $100 million in liquidations. BlackRock and other sources quickly debunked the claim, and Cointelegraph later apologized for a “tweet that led to the dissemination of inaccurate information.”  In a statement published Monday evening, Cointelegraph said the issue came about because of an error by its social media team and promised to review its internal practices.  Total bitcoin liquidations in the last 12 hours hit $137.2 million, with long liquidations coming in at $45.6 million and short at $91 million, according to CoinGlass data.  In a note, David Lo, head of financial products at Bybit, wrote that on-chain activity shows bitcoin holdings by long-term investors are reaching record levels, while Ethereum's gas usage is dropping significantly, leading to faster ether inflation. Bitcoin has increased its dominance – its share of the overall market capitalization of cryptocurrencies – while notching gains relative to ether.  Stocks trended upward.The S&P 500 closed up 1% while bonds drifted lower as diplomatic efforts intensified to prevent the Israel-Hamas conflict from becoming a regional conflict.

According to recent data, the balances of large ADA whales have continued to decline, suggesting that they may be selling off their substantial holdings. Cardano Whale Balances See Large Drop Over the last month, the balances of Cardano’s largest holders have been on a decline. This has occurred as the price of ADA has fallen but with each small recovery, these whales seem to be taking advantage of the market to sell at a profit. Related Reading: Standard Chartered Says Ethereum Price Can Reach $35,000, Here’s When The significant drop in balances over time has been noticed in the wallets holding between 1 million and 10 million ADA have fallen.

However, going into October, their balances began to drop by the millions. By October 15, their total balance was sitting at 5.41 billion, representing a drop of 220 million tokens. At the same time that this was happening, larger whales holding between 10 million and 100 million ADA have been increasing their balances. Their holdings increased from 11.81 billion ADA to 12.26 billion ADA toward the end of September. It then saw a small reversal but in August, their holdings settled at 12.16 billion tokens, representing a 300 million increase. This would suggest that while the 1 million to 10 million cohort had been selling, the 10 million and 100 million cohort had seized the opportunity to buy. This ended in a transfer of over 300 million ADA to these already massive whales, increasing their dominance in the market.

According to a critic on social media platform X, the DEX is on the know-your-customer (KYC)-verification route once Hooks on Uniswap v4 are released. Uniswap v4 Hooks Is The Beginning Of Censorship? Sharing screenshots, the user shared insights and said the exchange brings KYC verifications on the latest iteration. At the same time, the platform plans to use the “permission required” off-chain server on UniswapX for performance enhancements. UniswapX is an open-source solution allowing permissionless and open trading across Automated Market Makers (AMMs) and other liquidity sources. It is currently being tested on the Ethereum mainnet. Though the community has embraced these developments, the critic said these requirements, especially the identity verification requirement on Hooks, will be available as an option before being gradually made mandatory down the line. Related Reading: Bitcoin Takes The Lead As Crypto Funds See Third Straight Week Of Inflows Uniswap v4 is being developed, and Hooks will be one of the key updates. Hooks are programmable extensions for customizing pool and trade behavior, tightly integrated with Uniswap’s core protocol. With Hooks, it becomes easier for developers to implement other features such as dynamic fees, on-chain limit orders, and overly improved customization. In this way, it will also be possible to integrate Uniswap v4 into other protocols. Uniswap Evolution: Building “Real” DeFi? The DEX has constantly evolved and released new features since the first version went live in late 2018. Uniswap v1 introduced AMM, opening up decentralized finance (DeFi). This allowed liquidity providers (LPs) to be crucial to market making. In Uniswap v3, the exchange released concentrated liquidity (CL). This feature allows LPs to specify a price range within which they are willing to provide liquidity. In Uniswap v2, LPs provided liquidity across the entire price range of the token pair. In v3, liquidity depth increases while traders get better pricing. Related Reading: Tether Freezes 32 Crypto Addresses Linked To Terrorism In Israel And Ukraine Despite the criticism, Hooks has been supported in some quarters.

Chainlink Whales Made Moves Before LINK’s 3% Surge As pointed out by an analyst in a post on X, whales and institutional investors have shown an increasing amount of activity recently. The relevant indicator is the “large transactions volume” from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, which keeps track of the aggregate volume of Chainlink transactions larger than $100,000. Generally, the whales and institutional entities are the only investors capable of shifting such a large amount with a single transaction. These holders carry large balances in their wallets, making them influential on the network. Related Reading: Crypto Shorts See Carnage As Bitcoin Surges Towards $28,000 When the value of this metric is high, it means that these humongous investors are moving around large amounts right now. Such a trend implies that these investors are participating in some trading activity. However, this metric alone can’t discern exactly what kind of activity it is, as both selling and buying transactions appear the same on the blockchain and count towards this volume. On the other hand, when the indicator has low values, it suggests that the whales and institutional players aren’t interested in the cryptocurrency as they aren’t making too many moves. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Chainlink large transaction volume over the past few weeks: The value of the metric seems to have gone up in recent days | Source: @ali_charts on X As displayed in the above graph, the Chainlink large transactions volume registered a spike recently, implying that the whales had been moving many tokens across the network. At the peak of this spike, the whales transferred around 20.38 million LINK within 24 hours. This stack would be worth over USD 150 million at the current exchange rate. It’s uncertain why these humongous holders suddenly showed so much activity, but perhaps the surrounding price action could hint at it. This spike was seen a few days back, and since then, Chainlink has observed some net uptrend. Thus, the timing of the transactions could suggest two likely possibilities. These large investors bought in anticipation of this rally (perhaps due to some inside information), or their buying is why the price surge found its appropriate fuel in the first place. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Surges 7% In 10 Minutes On Fake iShares ETF News Either way, it’s a positive sign that the whales and institutional investors have recently participated in potential accumulation activity. In the coming days, this metric can be the one to keep an eye on, as further activity from these holders could signal that more volatile price action may be ahead. Once again, though, any future spikes could arise from both buying and selling, so they won’t necessarily be a bullish signal for Chainlink like this latest one turned out to be. LINK Price At the time of writing, Chainlink is trading around $0.74, up more than 3% in the past week.

False Rumors of BTC Spot ETF Approval Trigger Volatility Initially reported by Cointelegraph, the news claimed that BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Spot ETF had received regulatory approval. Related Reading: Elliott Wave Theory Forecasts XRP Price Of $27 By 2026: Crypto Analyst However, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart promptly cast doubt on the report’s authenticity, stating that he could not find any confirmation of the news at the time. Seyffart stated: I believe this to be fake news. While this would be positive for the things we’ve been saying. I can’t find anything that would confirm this at the moment. Subsequently, BlackRock confirmed to FOX reporter Eleanor Terret that the application was still under review, rendering the initial report false. The repercussions of this misinformation were immediately evident in the market. BTC experienced a brief surge from $27,800 to $30,000 within minutes as traders reacted to the purported ETF approval news. However, as the truth emerged, the market corrected itself, causing a wave of liquidations. According to data from Glassnode, the aftermath of the surge saw a significant increase in liquidations. Within four hours, $113.75 million in long positions and $78.87 million in short positions were liquidated, reflecting the volatility and sudden reversal prompted by the false news. The incident also prompted Cointelegraph to apologize for a post that had disseminated inaccurate information regarding the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF. The media outlet announced that an internal investigation is underway to determine the source of the misinformation. Cointelegraph stated: We apologize for a tweet that led to the dissemination of inaccurate information regarding the Blackrock Bitcoin ETF. An internal investigation is currently underway. We are committed to transparency and will share the findings of the investigation with the public once it is concluded within 3 hours. False Breakout Fails To Dampen Bitcoin Profitable Streak Despite the false breakout above $30,000, Bitcoin has retained significant profits within 24 hours. Currently trading at $28,100, it remains $1,000 higher than the initial price before disseminating the fake news across all platforms. This marks a 5.1% profit during this period. Related Reading: Litecoin At 12: How Has Its 84 Million Supply Been Distributed Over Time? Consequently, this positive turn of events has caused Bitcoin to shift from negative to positive figures across various time frames. In the past 7 days, Bitcoin has recorded a 2.6% profit, while over 30 days, it has seen a 6.4% increase. Only in the 14 days was a slight decrease of 0.4%. Furthermore, a closer examination of BTC’s 1-day chart reveals its ability to surpass significant resistance levels. Notably, Bitcoin successfully overcame two critical moving averages: the 50-day MA at $27,150 and the 200-day MA at $27,030. These moving averages posed major obstacles for Bitcoin’s price after initially dropping below this threshold. In addition, Bitcoin managed to break through the $28,000 resistance level, which had previously acted as a significant barrier following the false breakout above this mark. Moving forward, the sustainability of Bitcoin’s current price level and bullish momentum remains to be seen amidst the circulating rumors surrounding the long-awaited ETF decision by the applicants and the US SEC.

Bitcoin spiked up in the early hours of Monday to almost $28,000 before facing resistance that sent it back down. It would seem whales have been making moves to push BTC up, as indicated by the increasing number of whale wallets. New Bitcoin mid-whale addresses, meaning addresses holding between 100-1,000 BTC, saw a huge single-day increase recently, according to data from analytics firm Santiment. Unprecedented Growth in New Bitcoin Whale Addresses On-chain data have shown, as was previously reported, that Bitcoin whales are increasing their holdings, with long-term holders adding more than 50,000 BTC to their wallets each month. A similar occurrence took place over the weekend when the number of Bitcoin wallets holding between 100 and 1,000 BTC experienced its largest jump this year. Related Reading: By The Numbers: Bitcoin Hashrate Poised To Complete 100% Growth In 2023 An X post by crypto on-chain analytic platform Santiment revealed that this metric grew by 16 more wallets, its largest since February 2022.

42419439,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUETe9,1697482302,What’s All the Fuss About Bitcoin ETFs?,"Anyone can trade bitcoin (BTC): that’s the point of an open protocol like Bitcoin. So why is so much time and energy put towards getting alternative ways of accessing bitcoins? In particular, why is there so much hype around spot market bitcoin ETFs, or exchange-traded funds, especially when similar products (like “futures-based” ETFs and exchange-traded products, or ETPs) already exist?  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  And yet, today, at the mere rumor that asset manager BlackRock’s bitcoin ETF was finally approved (it wasn’t), markets bounced up by $2,000 (and then down). Clearly there’s something like pent up demand for these traditional financial instruments, or at least money on the sidelines waiting to trade the news around ETFs.  See also: The Real Reasons the Grayscale Bitcoin ETF Decision Matters | Opinion  Cointelegraph, which tweeted out the story then picked up by closely-watched news aggregator accounts, got it wrong. BlackRock’s iShares application is still under review by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the company clarified. Market watchers were already primed to look for ETF-related stories, given the confirmed news a competitor ETF application from Grayscale is back in play, after the SEC missed its chance to respond to an appeals court.  In the case of BlackRock’s ETF application, much of the excitement is tied to the fact that it's the largest asset manager in the world that did the filing and is interested to move deeper into crypto markets. BlackRock’s application alone was validation for the whole crypto industry, with comments made later by BlackRock CEO Larry Fink — who argued that a monetary asset untethered to any national government will become increasingly attractive — was sugar on top.  The desire for a spot market bitcoin ETF stems from the idea that many people, firms and funds who are interested in taking on exposure to bitcoin are not yet able to. A traditional financial wrapper for the novel bitcoin asset class would, therefore, act as a bridge to that sidelined capital. Some estimate billions of dollars could flow into a spot market bitcoin ETF. This is the theory, at least.  Although, arguably, the intense interest that has built up around bitcoin ETFs may have as much to do with the fact that the investing public has so far been denied. The SEC has rejected every spot-based BTC ETF application it has seen, starting with the Winklevoss twins' failed bid in 2013. The SEC’s argument has usually centered around the idea of market manipulation, in part because bitcoin’s relative illiquidity (liquidity is split up over the many exchanges that list BTC) and the lack of satisfactory market “surveillance” systems.  At least this has been the case up until last Saturday at midnight, when the SEC failed to respond to a court order to back-up its rejection of Grayscale’s bitcoin ETF application. Grayscale, a CoinDesk sister company, manages one of the first and still the largest closed-end bitcoin trusts, but wants to convert it into an open-ended ETF (the major difference being that people can more easily trade the shares of either bitcoin investment vehicle, and also more easily redeem their assets).  The SEC initially rejected Grayscale’s filing over the same surveillance and market manipulation concerns it has had for all spot BTC ETF applications. However, when Grayscale appealed the decision to a higher judicial authority, a panel of judges found the SEC’s reasoning “arbitrary” and “capricious” — the SEC failed to show how spot BTC ETFs are any more dangerous than futures-based ETFs being traded today in the U.S. without issue.  This all means that Grayscale’s application is back in play, and the SEC doesn’t really have grounds to reject it again. Hurrah! Bitcoin traded up 4.5% early Monday morning, whhttps://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/10/16/grayscale-gbtc-discount-narrows-to-near-2-year-low-as-sec-misses-etf-appeal-window/ile the discount on the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) narrowed to its lowest level since December 2021. Bloomberg analysts said there is a 90% chance ​​a bitcoin ETF will debut by Jan. 10.  The question now is whether Grayscale will be first through the ETF door. As mentioned, a number of traditional finance firms have edged in on the territory, including BlackRock, Fidelity and VanEck. Given the SEC’s hostility to crypto firms, it’s possible one of these offerings will be first to list — some even suspect SEC Chair Gary Gensler secretly urged BlackRock to file an application, given the numerous market surveillance tools it would apply.  Though in another sense, it doesn’t quite matter who is first to market, but only whether the thesis that spot bitcoin ETFs will lead to a cascade of institutional interest and investment in BTC. Bitcoiners have been widely off the mark in the past when “not giving financial advice,” including on the claim that BTC is a hedge against inflation, destined to hit $100,000 or would be widely adopted as a global reserve currency.  The demand for ETF news is clear enough — as Blockworks reported, the Binance BTC/USDT market, which accounts for 8% of bitcoin daily trading volume, saw a 7% candle roughly 30 minutes after an unsourced, unproven tweet about BlackRock’s approval was posted. Mind you, this is in an industry that was already embarrassed by fake news that in 2022 WalMart was going to accept litecoin (LTC), a project that hasn’t been relevant since the year it was created.  See also: Price of Litecoin Spikes on Fake Walmart Press Release  Crypto markets are in need of fresh capital (especially after over $100 million in options were liquidated during the BlackRock spoof), and many are still hanging their hats on the idea that mass adoption can still come. The idea that ETFs will drive institutional adoption is plausible, but likely overhyped — like every other major crypto event known in advance from bitcoin halvings every four years to Ethereum’s “Merge,” people have traded the news even though in an efficient market those happenings would be “priced in.”  I think, to a large degree, interest in bitcoin ETFs stems from this never-ending need to find something to be hopeful about. Further, the fact that markets have been deprived of ETFs only makes them more tempting — similar to the industry’s calls for “regulatory clarity,” which will simultaneously restrain some activity while supposedly creating the foundation for future adoption, if any regulatory advancements are satisfying at all.  This may sound like a Freudian’s psycho-sexual interpretation of behavioral economics, but economies are made of people and people have drives and desires, including coveting what you don’t yet have.

18924052,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=555617,1697479233,Bitcoin Takes The Lead As Crypto Funds See Third Straight Week Of Inflows,"Despite an array of uncertainties that have dotted the crypto horizon, recent data from Coinshares reveals a continuous faith in the sector, especially the foremost crypto giant, Bitcoin. Digital asset investment products have seen a steady and positive trend, recording net inflows for three weeks. Amid these inflows, Bitcoin emerges as the most dominant, presenting a robust case for its standing in the market. Related Reading: Will October Be Bitcoin’s Golden Month Again? A Dive Into A Decade Of Bullish Trends Bitcoin Steers The Inflow Wave According to the latest report by CoinShares, Bitcoin-centric products experienced inflows amounting to $16 million just in the past week. This surge has swelled the year-to-date inflows, positioning them at $260 million. CoinShares’ data also shed light on inflows into Short-Bitcoin funds, which amounted to $1.7 million. However, the report reveals that the recent data might not reflect the aftermath of the SEC’s decision not to appeal against the Grayscale legal challenge. James Butterfill, the Head of Research at CoinShares, noted: It is worth noting that our data, which is as of Friday’s close, was unlikely to capture the positive news out of the US regarding the SEC not appealing the Grayscale legal challenge, potentially paving the way for a spot-based ETF in the US. While Bitcoin held its ground, other cryptocurrencies also showcased noteworthy movements. Solana’s investment products added roughly $3.7 million, building upon the $24 million from the previous week. XRP maintained momentum, recording its 25th week of positive inflows with an additional $420,000. Butterfill highlighted the continuous support from the “investment community” for XRP, especially in light of the recent “successful legal challenges” against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). However, it wasn’t all sunshine and roses. Ethereum funds witnessed a setback, with outflows of $7.4 million. This seemed to neutralize most inflows after the launch of six Ethereum futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs) the previous week. Butterfill pointed towards potential “protocol design concerns” as a plausible reason. Other digital assets such as Litecoin, Chainlink, and Tezos also witnessed minor outflows of $280,000, $310,000, and $250,000, respectively. Global Inflow Dynamics Regarding the global distribution of these inflows, Germany stood out, accounting for the bulk of the week’s inflows with $16.1 million. The US and Canada followed suit, with inflows of $2.1 million and $3.5 million respectively. Interestingly, Sweden was the only European nation to witness an outflow of $7.5 million. Butterfill states that despite this positive net inflow trend, “trading volumes remain 27% below the 2023 average.” Regardless, Bitcoin, which led the pack in last week’s inflow, experienced a dramatic shift in recent hours. Specifically, the asset witnessed a swift surge above $30,000, propelled by an unsubstantiated rumor by Cointelegraph about the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving a spot BTC ETF. The regulator debunked the rumors. Related Reading: Bitcoin Path To $70,000?

The company has frozen 32 addresses containing $873,118.34, allegedly linked to illicit activities in Israel and Ukraine. Tether Collaborates With Global Law Enforcement According to a blog post on October 16, Tether has played a significant role in assisting 31 law enforcement agencies across 19 jurisdictions, freezing $835 million in assets primarily associated with thefts from blockchain and exchange hacks. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Surges 7% In 10 Minutes On Fake iShares ETF News The company’s collaborations span various countries, including Brazil, Singapore, Germany, Canada, Argentina, China, Ukraine, and the United States. By actively engaging with authorities, Tether aims to contribute to the fight against cybercrime and ensure stolen funds are returned to legitimate users. The company further stated: Of this, Tether has frozen 32 addresses, containing $873,118.34, that were found to be linked to illicit activity in Israel and Ukraine. Tether has been working with the NBCTF in Israel to counter cryptocurrency-funded terrorism and warfare. The ability of Tether to freeze and return illicitly obtained funds highlights the traceability and transparency of blockchain transactions. Contrary to common misconceptions, cryptocurrency transactions are not anonymous; they are meticulously recorded on the blockchain, allowing for the tracking and tracing of fund movements. CEO Stresses Traceability The recently announced CEO of Tether, Paolo Ardoino, emphasized that criminals using cryptocurrencies for illegal activities will inevitably be identified. Ardoino stated: Tether remains committed to promoting responsible blockchain technology use and standing as a robust defense against cybercrime. We eagerly anticipate continued collaboration with global law enforcement agencies as part of our commitment to global security and financial integrity. While Tether’s actions demonstrate the industry’s capacity to combat criminal use effectively, some critics within the blockchain industry continue to scrutinize the crypto sector, often neglecting to address the slow or inadequately equipped traditional financial system’s role in combating criminal funding. On this matter, Tether’s CEO emphasized the importance of recognizing the traceability and trackability of blockchain transactions, which serve as potent deterrents to illicit activities.

42419446,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUETkL,1697473800,Manta's Layer-2 Blockchain Already Plans to Ditch OP Stack for Polygon,"Manta's Pacific Network, a layer-2 blockchain that just launched on OP Labs' OP Stack for optimistic rollups, now plans to transition to a zk-rollup, building on Polygon technology.  It's the latest jolt to competition among the technology teams racing to provide technology that companies and developers can use to spin up their own layer-2 networks atop Ethereum.  OP Labs is the primary developer behind Optimism, or OP Mainnet, which is the second-biggest Ethereum layer-2 network after Arbitrum.  The Manta Pacific network, just a few weeks after going live as a layer-2 blockchain atop Ethereum with software from OP Labs’ OP Stack, is already planning to jump ship: Leaders of the project said Monday that the network will be retooled using a rival software package, Polygon’s Chain Development Kit (CDK).  The move means that Manta Pacific, a part of the Manta Network ecosystem, will ditch its status as a so-called optimistic rollup – the core underpinning of OP Stack – to become a “ZK-rollup,” which is what Polygon’s software kit provides. A ZK-rollup is a secondary network that relies on zero-knowledge proofs, a type of cryptography that has become one of 2023’s hottest blockchain trends, partly due to the technology’s ability to provide fast “finality” or settlement of transactions.  The news provides yet another jolt to the increasingly competitive field of layer 2 blockchain teams, which have been battling over prospective new projects that might help to expand their interconnected ecosystems. In addition to the OP Stack and Polygon zkEVM, there are rival software kits available or under development from Matter Labs, which stands behind the zkSync project, and Arbitrum, which is another layer-2 blockchain.  The point of these blockchain software development kits (SDKs) is to make the tools available to developers for free so that they can create their own customizable blockchains. Celo recently disclosed that it was considering Polygon’s CDK kit over the OP Stack to roll out its layer 2 chain, and Matter Labs quickly jumped in to say it was vying for the project as well.  The Manta decision could come as a blow to OP Labs, which has been riding high ever since the OP Stack was chosen as the foundation for cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase’s new layer-2 blockchain, ‘Base.’ OP Labs is the primary developer behind Optimism, or OP Mainnet, which is the second-biggest Ethereum layer-2 network after Arbitrum, according to L2Beat.  The Manta Network ecosystem also has its own layer-1 blockchain, Manta Atlantic, according to the project's documentation.  ZK-rollups vs. optimistic rollups  Blockchain experts have said that ZK technology might be more advanced than optimistic technology.  But OP Labs, the team behind the OP Stack, has insisted they don’t see any threat from ZK-rollup stacks, partially because of its modular proof system, which will eventually allow blockchains to choose to submit fault proofs or validity (ZK) proofs.  A key reason Manta Pacific mainnet is migrating to Polygon’s CDK is because of concerns over security, highlighting the fact that OP Stack currently doesn’t have any fault proofs to secure its system. Fault proofs are at the core of optimistic rollup technology, and OP Labs is currently still testing them on their OP Goerli testnet.  “Even with the proofs available, it really is contingent on someone in the network actually generating a proof,” said Kenny Li, a co-founder of Manta to CoinDesk. “There's that long delay on the withdrawal side, which, users are kind of impatient, as they should be. It's their assets.”  “The layer of security that we're primarily focused on is around the purpose,” Li adds.  Manta becoming a ZK rollup will take some time though, with a transition period for about six to nine months, Li told CoinDesk.  “We definitely want to take things slow, make sure that everything is being built out right, and we do the audits that we need to on our side,” Li said.

42392279,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg4dDR,1697473415,The Ripple Effects of a Spot Market Bitcoin ETF,"The likelihood of having a spot market bitcoin ETF, or exchange-traded fund, ready to list on the market by year’s end is now a near certainty. After years of legal wrangling, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has run out the clock on applying to the U.S. Court of Appeals, which recently excoriated the securities regulator for its seemingly biased decision in approving a futures-based ETF while denying a substantively similar spot market-based product.  A spot market bitcoin ETF is something of a holy grail for the crypto industry, despite the fact that these stock market-traded financial funds already trade in Canada and Europe. The reason why has to do almost entirely with the SEC denying the dozens of applications its seen so far, putting it out of reach for U.S. investors looking for bitcoin exposure without buying bitcoin directly.  See also: In Canada, Spot Bitcoin ETFs Have Been Working for Years  For instance, Grayscale’s filing for a spot bitcoin ETF in October 2021 and its rejection by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in June 2022 made far fewer headlines than the August ruling by a three judge panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals that the regulator was “wrong.” News of the court’s ruling made tidal waves across the crypto and financial worlds because of what it could mean for BlackRock's recent spot bitcoin ETF submission.  When one reads headlines such as “BlackRock: The Secret Company that Owns the World,” it’s no surprise that bitcoin’s price jumped 20% over the 11 days following the announcement from the world’s largest asset manager. The initial bump triggered optimistic enthusiasm about a future bull run.  Despite BlackRock’s 99.8% ETF approval record, it’s still unclear how the SEC will rule on this, given that it hasn’t approved any prior bitcoin ETFs and is aggressively targeting major U.S.-based crypto exchanges.  Nevertheless, the association of Bitcoin with BlackRock provides plenty of optimism among some Bitcoin and crypto maximalists, while others worry about a centralized entity yielding too much power in the space.  TradFi’s involuted relationship with bitcoin  Considering it appears BlackRock’s bitcoin ETF would be backed by actual bitcoin, and would therefore require the asset manager to purchase as much bitcoin as the ETFs it sells, it’s quite clear it will boost the price of the cryptocurrency. On its face, however, institutional interest in bitcoin and crypto isn’t new. After the Winklevoss twins — yes, those Winklevoss twins — filed the first bitcoin ETF in 2013, several major financial institutions like UBS, Citi, Barclays and more showed interest in crypto and blockchain. And all this was before the 2017 bull run.  Since then, institutions of all sizes have continued exploring offering crypto services to their list offerings. An entire ecosystem of projects dedicated to providing institutions with the infrastructure they need to securely offer things like decentralized finance (DeFi) services and tokenized assets has come out of the woodwork.  Galaxy-owned GK8, for example, lets institutions provide an array of digital-asset services with the security guarantee of its trusted custody platform and flagship Cold Vault. Such projects that hand-hold institutions into the crypto frontier have helped banks and investment firms find new revenue streams while expanding crypto adoption.  See also: Bitcoin Jumps to Near $28K as Bulls Bet on ETF Approval  The transparency and speed of transactions has inspired banks to collaborate within an industry consortium to develop common blockchain platforms in an effort to facilitate quicker and smoother movement of funds. JPMorgan Chase, too, has been building a private blockchain network for years, and now plans to release its own crypto wallet.  With more TradFi involvement in crypto and growing usage of blockchain and other crypto-related technologies, it begs the question: What difference would BlackRock’s ETF approval really make beyond raising bitcoin’s price trajectory?  Crypto whales  For the optimists, an SEC approval for BlackRock’s ETF would legitimize not only bitcoin, but the entire crypto industry. This belief is hardly debatable. With an unprecedented $9 trillion in assets under management and 70 offices across 30 nations, BlackRock is a bridge between bitcoin and an unfathomable amount of wealth.  And when the world’s largest and most prestigious asset manager shows interest in a specific asset or asset class, investors across the globe take notice.  This zeitgeist toward bitcoin normalization could also be bolstered by pending regulatory clarity in the U.S. Greater institutional involvement will likely heighten the competitiveness of traditional financial institutions in offering crypto products and infuse capital into the crypto market, leading to rising prices and liquidity.  But rising prices don’t necessarily mean long-term sustainability within crypto. We’ve witnessed several bull cycles and massive price swings in just the last six years. There’s also no guarantee that a rise in bitcoin’s price will translate to rising crypto prices across the board.  Decentralization purists are justified to feel threatened by certain elements of TradF gaining an expanded role in a space they primarily built. To them, massive asset managers and investment banks represent an ideological enemy and they fear it throwing its not proportioned weight around, or worse, swallowing up crypto-native companies altogether just like the whale swallowing up the Prophet Jonah in the Bible. While Jonah was spat back out after three days, a TradFi whale takeover could erase all the progress crypto and DeFi have made over the last couple of years.  In the event of a bitcoin ETF and balanced regulatory approaches in the U.S. and E.U., crypto (mainly DeFi) and TradFi can coexist because they serve different demographics with different services and products.  See also: SEC Won't Appeal Loss in GBTC Case, Boosting ETF Odds  In addition to applying innovative financial solutions to digital and real-world assets, crypto companies can also expand adoption by providing financial services to underbanked populations, mainly in developing nations, because of the technical advantage firms like BlackRock, Fidelity and VanEck hold over the financial sector.  Moreover, major institutions can help facilitate convenient access to DeFi products like staking, lending and borrowing to investors who are less familiar with the technical obstacles needed to engage with crypto directly.  Not long ago, TradFi was threatened by a nascent crypto industry bent on undermining the need for a well-established centralized financial world. And with uncertain regulations in the pipeline, a potential bitcoin ETF, and more interest from TradFi that scenario has been flipped.  But by utilizing their own strengths, TradFi and crypto-native companies can help build a more robust crypto ecosystem capable of fueling mass adoption, regardless of whether the SEC approves the proposed ETF.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Matan Doyich,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/10/16/the-ripple-effects-of-a-spot-market-bitcoin-etf,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5176c66a7ef9e2c380456681aaefb95cd9c7cabc-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The asset manager further noted that the court will issue its final ruling within seven days. This is likely to be a reiteration of the original August ruling in which the court said the SEC was “arbitrary and capricious” in its reasoning for declining Grayscale’s application for the spot bitcoin product.

This is a 26% increase in the burn rate compared to the previous seven days. Some of the largest burns came from the ‘0x909a9’ and ‘0x4be2’ addresses. Both addresses burned a total of 7,119,784 million and 8,095,490 million tokens respectively. The total comes out to over 15 million tokens, accounting for around 27% of the total burns for the day. SHIB price holding $0.0000071 | Source: SHIBUSD on Tradingview.com Shiba Inu Sees Price Recovery On Sunday, the price of Bitcoin surged toward the $28,000 level, and in response, the rest of the crypto market followed the flagship cryptocurrency. Shiba Inu was no different and finally saw a reversal in its bull stretch since the month began. Shiba Inu rose around 1.24% in the 24-hour period and although this is not as impressive as some of the recoveries mounted by other assets, it has helped the cryptocurrency to secure its support at $0.000007. This gives bulls some wiggle room as they regain their bearings in the market. Related Reading: How Ripple’s Rumored Token Burn Could Affect The XRP Price However, Shiba Inu is still seeing small losses of 0.59% on the weekly chart. This suggests that the bulls’ hold on the asset is weak and bears could regain control if momentum slips. This battle for control is mirrored by the daily trading volume of the crypto which is up 25.85% and sitting at $101.7 million, according to data from CoinMarketCap. So far, there doesn’t seem to be any special event pushing the price of SHIB besides the Bitcoin recovery. Given this, if the Bitcoin rally ends, then SHIB will most likely follow and fall into losses again.

42392287,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg4dxb,1697468400,"Coinbase Ventures, Haun Ventures Raise Crypto Political Capital With University of Arkansas Tech Sprint","The Silicon Valley VCs are linking up with the University of Arkansas, in a state with lawmakers and companies like Walmart and J.B. Hunt that are eyeing blockchain and crypto.  Arkansas “is home to innovative entrepreneurs, major corporations with global reach and policymakers including Rep. French Hill and Sen. John Boozman, both of whom have taken an interest in digital asset technology,” a Haun executive said.  Cryptocurrency-focused investment firms Coinbase Ventures and Haun Ventures are backing a technology accelerator program at the University of Arkansas, noting the southern state’s mix of entrepreneurs and large corporations, as well as some influential policymakers.  Referring to Arkansas’ potential when it comes to shaping policy around crypto, Tomicah Tillemann, chief policy officer at Haun Ventures, said Arkansas is at the confluence of a number of forces shaping the landscape around blockchain technology and digital assets.  “The state is home to innovative entrepreneurs, major corporations with global reach and policymakers including Rep. French Hill and Sen. John Boozman, both of whom have taken an interest in digital asset technology. All of this makes Arkansas a great place to work with the startup community,” Tillemann told Coindesk.  Coinbase and Haun are embracing a model seen elsewhere in the U.S., where many universities have tech-focused programs where corporations can set up shop to recruit students as interns. For example, Jump Trading, the Chicago-based crypto and traditional financial trading giant, had a group at the University of Illinois' Research Park; Jump Crypto President Kanav Kariya joined the company through that program.  The collapse of FTX last year caused alarm among lawmakers, not least because of disgraced boss Sam Bankman-Fried’s energetic solicitation of Capitol Hill to try and shape favorable regulation of crypto.  To some extent, Coinbase Ventures and Haun Ventures are preaching to the converted in Arkansas: Hill, the vice chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, also chairs a subcommittee on digital assets; Boozman, the ranking member on the Senate Agriculture Committee, is a co-sponsor of the Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act (known colloquially as the “SBF Bill” because of being backed by the now-disgraced FTX founder).  Tillemann of Haun Ventures pointed to other states which could be usefully targeted to boost crypto jobs and adoption, and also further policy discussions, similar to blockchain-focused Bounds Accelerator in Arkansas.  “There’s a great deal of engagement going on right now across the 50 states,” Tillemann said in an interview. “Arkansas is a very compelling example for a variety of reasons. But there are important conversations with founders and policymakers underway in places like Ohio and Montana and many other jurisdictions that are part of this evolving story of building the next generation of the internet.”  Shan Aggarwal, head of corporate development and ventures at Coinbase, pointed to large firms based in Arkansas like Walmart, Tyson Foods and J.B. Hunt, adding that blockchain tech can help streamline areas like supply chain management. (Walmart’s extensive explorations into so-called enterprise blockchain with the likes of IBM have been well documented.)  “I wouldn’t describe it as enterprise blockchain,” Aggarwal said in an interview. “But I do think there’s a rising tide of interest in blockchain and crypto technology from large enterprises like Walmart. Some of them are thinking about that more for enterprise use cases, such as helping revolutionize their supply chain, others are thinking about it more from a community or end consumer engagement perspective.”  The 16-week Bounds accelerator program is now accepting applications from startups with a U.S.-based location or representative until Nov. 3. The program begins on Jan. 8, 2024, and is bookended by an in-person orientation and demo day event in Bentonville, with weekly remote learning and mentoring sessions.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/10/16/coinbase-ventures-haun-ventures-raise-crypto-political-capital-with-university-of-arkansas-tech-sprint,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/25deab562fefe405fbe634578dcaba46f54198d5-4032x2268.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42392291,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg4dsT,1697466736,Former Top FTX Executive Testifies He Knew $8B of Customer Money Was Missing,"A former senior FTX executive, Nishad Singh, who has already pleaded guilty, testified as the third week of Sam Bankman-Fried’s criminal trial began.  Singh, who said he knew around $8 billion of FTX customers’ money had gone missing, helped crystallize points from previous testimony by other members of Bankman-Fried’s inner circle.  “I had a lot of admiration and respect for him, but over time that eroded,” Singh said of Bankman-Fried, his friend from high school.  NEW YORK — The third week of Sam Bankman-Fried’s criminal trial began with a member of his FTX inner circle weaving together statements from three previous witnesses, walking the jury step-by-step through the programming errors, product features and leadership decisions that let the crypto exchange allegedly misuse customers’ money – and led to the crypto empire blowing up.  Nishad Singh, who was head of engineering at FTX, said he “learned of a hole” in the company’s finances in September 2022. Though he noticed around $8 billion missing from Bankman-Fried’s company, he nevertheless approved transactions that he “implicitly” knew had to have come from user deposits, Singh testified Monday. That money was apparently funneled to Bankman-Fried’s affiliated trading firm, Alameda Research.  Singh has already pleaded guilty, as have two previous prosecution witnesses: FTX CTO Gary Wang and Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison. Singh’s testimony helped draw connections between their courtroom statements along with those of FTX engineer Adam Yadidia.  The financial hole was “enormous,” Singh said, adding that he learned in conversations with Bankman-Fried that the funds were used by Alameda for a variety of venture investments, political donations, real estate purchases and other expenditures.  Prosecutors seemed intent on using Singh to paint Bankman-Fried as the one who ultimately directed FTX and Alameda’s investments. Singh testified that Bankman-Fried would frequently ignore objections from other team members, making large investments designed to give his businesses entreé with celebrities, politicians and other people of influence.  One line of questioning zeroed in on a $200 million Alameda investment into K5 Global, a venture firm led by businessman Michael Kives. Singh said that Bankman-Fried attended a Kives-hosted Super Bowl party with Hillary Clinton, Jeff Bezos and Kendall Jenner, among others. Apparently impressed by the star power at the event, Bankman-Fired pitched the investment into Kives’ business as a way for FTX to earn “essentially infinite connections.”  Read all of CoinDesk’s SBF trial coverage here.  Singh, however, said he expressed concern that the investment, which would put FTX in proximity to celebrities and professional athletes, would be “value-extractive” and “toxic to FTX culture.”  “If we must go through with this, it must not go through FTX,” Singh recalled telling Bankman-Fried. “It should be Sam’s money, not FTX money.” Singh said his protestations didn’t yield results. Prosecutors entered a spreadsheet into evidence listing FTX and Alameda’s various venture investments; the sheet showed that the nine-figure K5 deal went through Alameda’s venture arm, not Sam’s own pocketbook.  The infamous ‘fiat@’ account  Singh, who worked at Alameda before FTX was founded, said he was aware from “FTX’s inception” that Alameda bank accounts had been used to store FTX customer funds – a move initially designed to circumvent the trouble FTX had with opening its own accounts.  He said he personally programmed systems in 2019 that routed FTX user deposits into Alameda bank accounts. Singh also added wire instructions to FTX’s website which, if followed, landed funds in Alameda-controlled accounts (testimony from earlier in the day showed that FTX users were instructed to wire funds to an Alameda-linked entity called “North Dimension”).  “Someone would manually credit” FTX user balances with the amounts deposited into Alameda’s bank accounts, he explained.  Singh said that in 2021, he and other FTX executives became aware of a bug in FTX’s internal accounting systems that overstated user deposits by around $8 billion. FTX recorded these user deposits in an internal database entry dubbed “fiat@.”  “When a withdraw was processed, the customer balance [on FTX] was decremented, funds were sent from actual bank accounts, but fiat@’s actual balance was not correctly adjusted,” Singh explained.  On top of this error, Singh testified that he built out systems on FTX that gave Alameda “special privileges” not afforded to other users. One feature, “allow negative,” let Alameda trade, borrow and even withdraw FTX funds in excess of its balance and collateral amounts, Singh testified. Singh said he coded an initial version of the feature in 2019 “at Sam [Bankman-Fried] and Gary [Wang’s] advisement and direction.”  Eventually, Alameda was able to borrow from FTX without ever having its collateral liquidated, and it was able to “withdraw money that it didn’t have,” Singh said. In sum, this meant that “Alameda could lose money” that “belonged to customers,” Singh testified.  “I don’t recall it ever being stated that [user] funds were being taken,” said Singh. “[I] recall affirmative statements from Sam and others that Alameda didn’t have any special privileges,” he added.  By June 2022, Alameda built up a $2.7 billion deficit on the FTX platform, and Alameda technically still owed billions in user funds to FTX that it no longer had on hand – withdrawals that FTX missed as a result of its accounting bug. Altogether, the negative account balance and buggy accounting system contributed to an $11 billion hole in FTX’s balance sheet, Singh testified.  Fooling the CFTC  Bankman-Fried tried to fool the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission by asking his lieutenants to move Serum (SRM) tokens he owned personally onto Alameda’s balance sheet, Singh testified Monday afternoon. Singh told the court he didn’t complete the transaction because it “felt wrong” to attempt to trick a federal regulator.  Later during his testimony, Singh walked the jury through his discovery that Alameda owed FTX customers billions of dollars after Bankman-Fried circulated a proposal called “We came, We saw, We Researched” about his potential plans to shutter Alameda and rehabilitate FTX’s image.  Caroline Ellison told Singh that it would be “impossible” to sunset the quant trading firm’s operations, alluding to Alameda’s inability to close out its accounts and pay back debts it owed to its sister company’s customers, Singh testified.  He then realized “customers had been betrayed,” Singh said.  SBF’s campaign donations  FTX had a sophisticated operation for donating funds to political candidates, Singh testified. Ryan Salame, an executive, would route funds from Singh’s bank and Prime Trust accounts to recipients. Singh was the face of some of these donations because of “advantageous optics,” he said.  Salame originated wire transfers from Singh’s Prime Trust account that Singh then had to approve, he said. Singh also signed blank checks that he gave to Gabe Bankman-Fried, the defendant’s brother, for use as donations to other political candidates.  Read more: FTX Asks Politicians Who Received Bankman-Fried Donations to Return Money  During another section of testimony, Singh said versions of a spreadsheet that inflated FTX’s revenues were sent to FTX investors. At Bankman-Fried’s direction, Singh said that he recorded crypto staking fees in a spreadsheet and went into FTX’s database to mark these fees as having come in throughout 2021, though this wasn’t actually true.  This was done to inflate FTX’s 2021 revenue to north of $1 billion, he said.  Bankman-Fried’s high school friend  Singh recounted his experience climbing the ranks from software developer to manager at FTX, the crypto exchange founded by his high school friend, Bankman-Fried.  At the beginning of his tenure at the exchange, Singh testified, he felt “intimidated” by the “formidable” and “brilliant” wunderkind who helmed the platform he was helping build out. But, that admiration quickly turned to “shame” following the September 2022 discovery that FTX’s executives were enriching themselves with customers’ funds.  “I had a lot of admiration and respect for him, but over time that eroded,” Singh told the court.  According to Singh, Bankman-Fried’s frequent dipping into customers’ funds was at times done “unilaterally” and was often “excessive.”  The issues of the executives’ lavish spending and the company’s poor investments were ones Singh eventually decided to raise to the former FTX CEO. But, when he broached the subject among a group of the company’s employees, Bankman-Fried berated him for it, Singh told the court.  “I thought we had been fleeced for $20 million,” Singh testified, but Bankman-Fried said “it was people like me who were seeding doubt” in the company.

Crypto Futures Observed $78 Million In Liquidations In Last 24 Hours A crypto futures contract is said to be “liquidated” when the derivative exchange with which said contract is open forcefully closes it up. This happens when the contract has accumulated losses of a certain percentage, the exact value of which may differ between platforms. In this sector, it’s not too rare to see a flood of such liquidations occurring within a short span of time. The reason behind that is the high volatility that most of the assets display on average. A lot of investors also like to play with extreme amounts of leverage, due to it being readily accessible in many platforms. Leverage alone can raise the risk of liquidation manyfold, so it combined with the high volatility can make it easy for contracts to be flushed down. Related Reading: Bloomberg Analyst Predicts Likelihood Of A Spot Bitcoin ETF By January 2024 During the past day, the crypto market has once again seen some notable volatility, which has led to another mass liquidation event on the futures side, as the data below from CoinGlass shows. Looks like the market has seen some high liquidations in the past day | Source: CoinGlass As is visible from the table, the crypto market as a whole has seen liquidations of more than $78 million in the last 24 hours. Out of these, $61.88 million involved the short contracts, equivalent to almost 80% of the total. This naturally makes sense, as this latest liquidation squeeze has been led by a rally in Bitcoin’s price. The value of the asset has shot up today | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView As displayed above, Bitcoin has enjoyed a sharp surge in the past day. At the peak of this rally, the coin had retested the $28,000 level but has since seen a bit of pullback. The rest of the sector also followed the original crypto in this rally (as is usually the case), which is why shorts around the sector have taken a beating today. The below table shows what the individual contribution towards this liquidation squeeze has looked like for the different symbols in the sector. The breakdown of the liquidations by asset | Source: CoinGlass As expected, Bitcoin occupies the largest share of liquidations with $31.5 million, while Ethereum is second at $13.06 million. Interestingly, Loom Network (LOOM) is third in this list, despite the asset being just the 71st largest in the sector by market cap. Related Reading: Have Traders Moved Past Dogecoin? Transactions Plunge 98% Since June The altcoin has enjoyed a sharp rally of more than 113% in the past week, which is perhaps why the crypto has had such strong interest behind it on the futures market. Bitcoin Open Interest Has Rebounded Since The Squeeze As CryptoQuant analyst Maartunn has pointed out, the Bitcoin open interest, a measure of the total amount of contracts associated with the asset currently open on the futures market, has jumped back since the liquidation flush occurred. The metric has climbed back up from its lows | Source: @JA_Maartun on X It would appear that more speculators have jumped on the market even after seeing a large amount of traders getting liquidated. Generally, the open interest being high can lead to volatility, so the indicator retracing back to its levels from before the plunge could mean BTC would soon see more sharp price action in the near future.

The false post was deleted after nearly 30 minutes but sparked enough interactions to impact prices significantly. Bitcoin has since fallen from $30,000 to $28,000 following skepticism from analysts and reporters. BlackRock confirmed to CoinDesk that the report is false.  CoinGlass data shows that $81 million worth of short positions, or bets against higher prices, were liquidated on the move to $30,000, and $31 million in longs, or bets on higher prices, were liquidated during the correction. Liquidation refers to when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. It happens when a trader is unable to meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position (fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open).  The SEC website shows no approvals for a spot bitcoin ETF. Bloomberg also reported that the BlackRock application is still under review.  It was reported last week that the SEC won't appeal the loss in its case against Grayscale, which is thought to boost the chances of GBTC eventually being converted to a spot ETF. Bitcoin rose 4% in Asian morning hours on Monday, a continuation of Friday’s reaction to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) decision to not appeal to a recent Grayscale ruling.

The digital economy is continuing to surge forward — making it an urgent necessity for a proper legal framework to be created, one that strikes a balance between fostering innovation and maintaining the integrity of our financial system.  The key to achieving balanced rules and regulations lies in good faith actors following the rules where they are clear and pushing for clarity where they are opaque, all while ensuring that both industry participants and regulators alike work together to create a robust framework that promotes innovation and safeguards consumers.

Their efforts, however, have been historically met with a degree of shrouded hostility from regulatory bodies, particularly the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  The SEC has time and time again argued that there is no ambiguity in the rules, and that the existing laws are effective and clear when applied to digital assets. In the words of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, “Some in the crypto industry have called for greater ‘guidance’ with respect to crypto tokens. For the past five years, though, the commission has spoken with a pretty clear voice here.”  However, for industry writ large, including public companies like Coinbase who have done their best to comply with the aforementioned existing rules, the only thing that is clear is that the current framework falls flat in protecting investors and companies alike.  As we continue to build smart, and work hard in the arena of public policy, we will soon see the fruits of our collective labor  Recently, leaders in this work have built around them a large advocacy community in Washington D.C. and abroad, advocating for a collaborative process in which rules can be written to accommodate this entirely new type of financial technology. Their efforts have generally been answered with silence and lawsuits from regulators, but with increased attention from legislators.  The SEC's legal actions against legitimate individuals and entities operating in the crypto space have raised the most serious concerns. Cases against entities such as Ripple, LBRY and Coinbase put on clear display that the regulators are not willing to work with the industry, and only seek to crush it.  It is no secret that, like in most industries, there are entities acting maliciously that seek to deceive and defraud in the digital asset space. However, those actors have remained free from the regulatory hammer of the SEC, while legitimate companies who are legitimately trying to comply have been targeted with pricey lawsuits.  These enforcement actions have left industry participants wondering whether they can trust the regulatory environment in the U.S. and have further highlighted the need for clear and well-defined regulations to prevent this booming industry from off-shoring itself.  It is essential to acknowledge that the crypto industry, like any other sector, has its share of bad actors, but punishing those who genuinely seek to comply with the law only muddies the waters and discourages responsible innovation.  Getting better?  Recently, things have been starting to trend in a promising direction. Many of the issues the industry has faced have stemmed from an SEC that is clearly seeking to expand its jurisdiction, and from legislators who are unwilling to understand the meaning of this new technology.  Now, the SEC is taking a beating, both in the court of law, and the court of public opinion. After a massive Ripple victory against the SEC in summary judgment, the SEC filed an appeal that was broadly rejected by the court. This pair of losses essentially guts the SEC’s legal strategy and is a clear sign to the agency that their philosophy is misguided at best, or malicious at worst.  See also:What Ripple's Partial XRP Win Means for Other Crypto Firms  The SEC has also been tripped up by both their filings in the Coinbase case and in congressional hearings. In the Coinbase suit, it is trying to assert that crypto tokens have no inherent value, which as a blanket statement, is undeniably false. Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal has brushed this position off as more of the same old nonsense that the SEC has been working off of for years.  During a recent oversight regulatory hearing featuring Chairman Gensler, Rep. Ritchie Torres (D-NY) used his time to offer a very compelling line of questioning using Pokemon cards to highlight the agency’s deliberate lack of clarity. “Suppose I was to purchase a Pokemon card. Would doing so constitute a security transaction?”Gensler said. “I don’t know what the context is,"" he continued, before admitting that it isn’t a security if it is bought physically.  Rep. Torres then asked: “If I were to purchase a tokenized Pokemon card on a digital exchange via a blockchain, is that a security transaction?”  “I’d have to know more,” Gensler said.  Representatives like Ritchie Torres, and the current interim Speaker of the House Patrick McHenry (R-NC) are good examples of lawmakers who have familiarized themselves with the digital asset space and have taken the necessary steps to try and create legislation for it.  These allies of the industry are clear beacons of the long overdue legal framework that appears to be closer to reality than ever.  See also: Where Is Crypto Policy Heading in a Post-FTX World?  Although the state in which this industry currently exists in America is less than ideal, and certainly far from clear, it is a blunt fact that the road to achieving legal clarity and adoption of new technologies is a long and perilous one.  It takes time and effort, education and funding and above all steadfast commitment from the passionate individuals who have dedicated themselves to innovation. Although these last years have been beyond frustrating, it is clear that so long as we continue to build smart, and work hard in the arena of public policy, we will soon see the fruits of our collective labor.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Zac Townsend ,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/10/16/how-clear-and-effective-crypto-regulations-are-born,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/adec6868271ad8036fd6ae22cf65b27f6930025f-1852x1042.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Coinbase's profitability could be affected by regulatory crackdowns and issues in the crypto sphere. The recent drop in crypto prices hasn’t helped their cause. Crypto is in essence a highly volatile market. Introduction – A tentative backdrop makes for a bearish case Coinbase ( COIN ) is touted as America’s leading cryptocurrency exchange. Furthermore, the firm operates globally and therefore enjoys an unparalleled brand recognition in this newfound area. It does not have any headquarters preferring to be web based despite managing over $170 billion. If you are a Coinbase shareholder, congratulations on owning one of the best-performing stocks this year. It has registered a 140% gain year to date. However, this may be the time to consider selling your portion and keeping an eye out for the external conditions that impact crypto if you wish to jump back in. There isn’t much renewed investor interest by what we have gathered. Coinbase’s stock price has declined since it reached a high of $110.15 on July 19, 2023. What is more, the current trading price of $73.43 is far below the opening price of $381 back in 2021. The market cap has dramatically fallen from a closing high of $86 billion to just over $17 billion. The bull run in 2021 where the firm’s revenue surged an impressive 545% to $7.36 billion could just be a one-time occurrence by the looks of things. Everything points to the fact that the frenzy in cryptocurrencies has dissipated. After all, the price of Bitcoin and Ethereum have dropped off considerably making them investments with little to no ROI. Investors are wary of Coinbase given this backdrop and the fact that regulators across the globe have made it difficult for crypto exchanges. Transaction revenues have fallen From making $1.5 billion in transactions in Q1 2021, the crypto exchange has seen this revenue segment decline to $375 million in Q1 2023. Even when looking at percentages, there has been a big drop. From 86% in Q1 of 2021 to 46% of its total revenue in Q1 of this year. There is some positive for shareholders in the form of increased interest in subscription and services. There has been a doubling of revenue from this segment which is totally $362 million as of the first quarter of 2023. However, all is not doom and gloom for the transaction revenue division. It was red hot and drove Coinbase stock price and can make a comeback. Ryan Selkis, co-founder of the crypto market intelligence firm Messari, stated that transaction revenue could re-emerge as a top revenue source for Coinbase in the future. We disagree with Selkis as his premise is based on another wave of enthusiasm and this may not manifest by the current crypto state of affairs. It is the earnings that have us bearish on this stock. Even the federal court decision in late August to launch a spot-based Bitcoin ETF hasn’t rallied the share price. This ruling was seen as a big positive by Wall Street which could potentially bring in billions of dollars of institutional funds into crypto. Despite this analysts have warned to avoid Coinbase. The earnings headwinds now comes in the form of rigid competition from Wall Street funds and brokerages. The SEC being tough on Coinbase has depressed revenues as well. Why not to invest in crypto Personal finance guru Dave Ramsey does not believe in Bitcoin as an investment and terms it funny money. As much as finance experts have pointed out that they do not see any intrinsic value in Bitcoin or crypto in general, it must be said there is no utility in these digital offerings. One cannot pay their electric bill with crypto or buy groceries for that matter. There was a time when digital technology was threatening fiat currencies for their convenience and low cost transactions. But with all the regulatory crackdowns investors best beware of crypto. It appears to be an excellent concept in theory, but the threat of the established fiat currencies still looms. Consequently, now wouldn’t be the right time to buy crypto. On a separate note, a lot has been said about the finite value of Bitcoin. But these are all internet technologies and it takes a computer geek or two to crack the code and totally modify the whole thing . Individual investors should resist the temptation to put money in crypto as it can be addicting. If you do make some money, then you may continue to bet on it which could end badly. This is coming from us who count among us one of our authors who made over a 400 percent gain on Bitcoin in a single year. But we have decided not to keep purchasing and moved away from crypto investments altogether. At least for the time being. 2022 Events and America’s perception of crypto The failure of many renowned crypto trading venues and lending platforms, such as FTX, Celsius Networks, Voyager and Three Arrows Capital, in 2022 (the “2022 Events”) has negatively affected the business environment Coinbase operates in. These 2022 events contribute to a lack of trust in crypto exchanges and may continue to have a bearing on the broader cryptoeconomy. Investors are faced with the very real risk of losing their capital and there is no deposit insurance as such. This makes the whole thing murky. According to a Motley Fool service, Americans are increasingly of the view that cryptocurrency is a bad investment. Nonetheless, more Americans are expected to include this type of speculative investment in their portfolio this year. But the reasons may not be all that pleasing for shareholders. Crypto ownership for making purchases in the metaverse has grown exponentially. Additionally, there are those hobbyists who do it for fun. But even this has dropped off slightly. Some positives – frenzied interest in crypto and a stable current financial picture Bitcoin Google Search Relationship (cointelegraph) Bitcoin and crypto as a whole have seen a lot of interest from investors. So much so that Google trends has illustrated how the price of Bitcoin has been influenced by Google search. The question arises whether the whole thing is just a fad. Since several experts have opined on the dangers of crypto and looking to speculate on it, we will have to conclude that there may not be such drummed up interest going forward. In other words, the crypto frenzy has died down considerably. In more positives, Coinbase Pay is a feature that helps improve customer experience. The objective is to get mainstream users as crypto transactions can often be rather laborious. These sort of facets to the business aim to provide comforts and convenience to the consumer. Incidentally, these make for great value. Additionally, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong opines that crypto regulation could serve as a plus for the company. There really isn’t much the company can do in being resilient in the wake of this type of ruling. Technology growth has been a key area and customer loyalty efforts could be stepped up. In this regard, Coinbase Prime is getting a lot of traction from institutional investors in recent weeks. The company did some restructuring this year when it terminated 950 employees in different departments and locations. This was after the 2022 restructuring that saw 1100 staff members being dismissed. Coinbase is bracing for hard times ahead and this leaner approach may give it the chance to survive. For the last quarter, Coinbase had long term debt of $3.334 billion which was a slight decline YOY. Coinbase is not debt-ridden and it paints a sound financial picture. The cash position is just over $5 billion, but the biggest concern is that the company’s future profitability is doubtful, at least by Moody’s assessments . We would like to point out here that the greatest challenges can be a company’s greatest opportunities. If Coinbase can come out these tumultuous circumstances, it would totally change our outlook on the stock. Valuation Crypto is having a hard time at the moment and the figures reflect this. At the moment, earnings and EPS are in negative territory, making P/E based valuation redundant. We tried our hand at a DCF valuation as outlined below. We are pessimistic on the company’s earnings forecasts given the headwinds and we will go with low, sometimes negative revenue growth over the next decade. For the base case, we shrunk revenues by about 49% per year on average. The company started off brilliantly with what could be termed as explosive growth, but has since seen some disappointing declines. For the optimistic case, I went with about 18% average revenue growth, while for the conservative I went with an average of about 74% in declines. In reflecting the earnings over the past three years, I manually put in some figures with declines occurring every other year or so projecting into the future. The website Alphaspread helped with the forecasts in my calculations. We were also inspired by the valuation done by Gytis Zizys . A 25% margin of safety was added to the intrinsic value calculation to give a better idea. Coinbase’s intrinsic value is -$92, implying a 179.8% downside from current valuations. Attempt at a DCF valuation (Morningstar) Author’s own calculations The optimistic case of the valuation is very attractive, but we must keep in mind that growth rates used were on the high side. The reason for the superior growth rates assumed was the initial impetus Coinbase had and the likelihood of coming close to replicating something like that. These valuations could totally change if there is a regulatory curb or some sort of respite. But even if Coinbase is able to get away from litigation, there won’t be a long-term let off in our opinion. Traditional players are well capitalized and the increased competition they might bring could keep Coinbase stock a flash in the pan so to speak. Conclusion – Sometimes it's prudent to follow the crowd The crypto market is unpredictable and the SEC’s endeavor to tighten the screws on Coinbase and the sector itself makes a turnaround rather unlikely. In summary, there are plenty of other growth stocks to invest in. Investors’ risk appetites are alright, but again the perception of crypto as unsafe makes it hard to fathom that a turnaround could occur at this juncture. While blockchain and digital currencies can be a game changer, it is best to steer clear off Coinbase for the foreseeable future.

The crypto recently completed its third halving in August, finally reducing the number of LTC miners receive as a reward for mining a block from 12.5 LTC to 6.25 LTC. Over the past 12 years, much of this supply has been distributed to miners as block rewards for verifying Litecoin transactions. At the time of writing, there are 73.76 million LTC in circulation, with data showing this supply concentrated among large holders. Estimates from the crypto analysis platform IntoTheBlock show that over 49% of LTC is held by accounts with more than 0.1% of the circulating supply. BitInfoCharts also puts addresses with more than 100,000 LTC having 38.01% of the total supply. Related Reading: By The Numbers: Bitcoin Hashrate Poised To Complete 100% Growth In 2023 Source: IntoTheBlock Who Are the Biggest Litecoin Wallet Holders Today? Litecoin’s 84 million total supply has been distributed over the past 12 years through mining rewards and market trading. The biggest wallet addresses include large miners that have accumulated Litecoin from years of mining and crypto exchanges. Charlie Lee, its creator, claims to have sold or donated all LTC tokens in his collection. The honor of the biggest Litecoin wallet address belongs to “M8T1B”, accounting for 3.34% of the entire supply in circulation. This wallet holds 2,504,667 LTC worth $158,105,141 at the current market price. Next is “ltc1qr” holding 2,225,000 LTC worth $140,451,374. Wallet addresses “MQd1f” and “ltc1qn” comes third and fourth in rankings, holding 1,344,464 LTC and 1,097,050 LTC worth $84,868,217 and $69,250,423 respectively. According to data from BitInfoCharts, these top four addresses hold 8.18% of the total coins in circulation. Source: BitInfoCharts Other top-ranking whales include addresses “ltc1q2” and “MQSs1,” with 927,542 LTC ($58,550,373) and 745,000 LTC ($47,027,540), respectively. Looking through the data shows these six addresses are the Litecoin blockchain whales holding more than 1% of the circulating supply. Metrics from IntoTheBlock put the total concentration of these whales at 11.88% (8.84 million LTC). Wallets “MB8nnF”, “MFULdM,” “MESruS,” and “LZEjck” complete the top 10 rankings with 513,259 LTC, 472,674 LTC, 416,688 LTC, and 394,044 LTC, respectively. What Does Litecoin’s Supply Distribution Mean for the Future? There seems to be a dull market movement with the whales as sellers continue to maintain control over the market. As a result, the inflow to wallets holding at least 0.1% of the circulating supply has decreased by 91.07% in the past three months. Source: IntoTheBlock With 87% of LTC already mined, the rate of new supply will slow down over time. This could support price stability and sustainability. Litecoin is currently trading at $63.07, and like all cryptocurrencies, and pseudonymous crypto analyst P_S_trade predicts Litecoin can push up to $84 very soon.

42392286,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg4dnL,1697460311,Where Is Crypto Policy Heading in a Post-FTX World?,"Among some crypto journalists, there is a sense the ongoing criminal trial of disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried may be the last great crypto trial. FTX’s implosion, and the subsequent market contagion and negative feedback loop of media coverage it kick started, has done the blockchain industry irreparable damage. The size of the estimated losses to FTX investors and users would, if convicted, place Bankman-Fried among the largest financial frauds in history. And, as many said, for better or worse, crypto is on the stand alongside him.  This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's State of Crypto Week sponsored by Chainalysis.  Still, for many crypto policy experts, the worst effects of FTX may already be behind this mercurial industry. According to two industry lobbyists based in Washington D.C. who could not go on the record, November and December of last year were likely the darkest months crypto will see, in terms of a backsliding political landscape. “For lawmakers who didn’t have an opinion or hadn’t made up their minds on crypto, FTX forced them to have an opinion,” one lobbyist told CoinDesk. The outlook wasn’t good.  These were the months when what some now refer to as “Operation Choke Point 2.0” came into focus. President Biden’s earlier commitment to taking a “whole of government” approach to managing crypto began to mean siccing the full force of the U.S. regulatory apparatus against this nascent technology. Within the span of weeks, the Federal Reserve, Treasury Department and the nation’s foremost finance and banking overseers seemingly did what they could to stifle the industry in the immediate aftermath of FTX’s collapse.  Bank accounts were closed. Working agreements were scuttled. And major lawsuits were filed. Two of the most important crypto companies, Binance and Coinbase, were accused of illicitly offering securities. U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler spoke before Congress as the legislative body ramped up efforts to pass crypto-appropriate rules it has spent years putting off, advocating for a licensing system that crypto critics and proponents agree would be unworkable.  While the U.S. government has floundered on creating clear rules of the road for crypto, jurisdictions across the globe have passed comprehensive policy reforms. MiCA, the most considerate guidance yet, coming in at over 150 pages, was ratified by the European Union, while Hong Kong and the United Emirates have passed legislation intended to make them into regional crypto powerhouses (while keeping consumers safe). An emerging realization among some U.S. political players is if the U.S. continues to fumble on regulating crypto, the already-global industry can innovate elsewhere.  CoinDesk’s “State of Crypto” Week will take on many of these live debates and legal arguments, to get down to the bottom of what type of reforms does crypto need. Do new rules need to be written, or do the century-old financial guidance in the U.S. just need updating? How can industry participants help lawmakers decide what crypto’s “market structure” should look like, and which organizations should oversee it. Where are self-regulatory organizations operable and where does the burden of preventing money laundering fall? Stablecoins, perhaps crypto's most successful singular innovation, need rules and oversight. Can AI help?  All of this is background to the question of where crypto goes from here, now that the ring appears to be closing in on so-called “industry villains,” including SBF. People, like LUNA’s Do Kwon and 3AC’s Su Zhu, who built (and lost?) fortunes reinserting middlemen and backroom agreements into a technology that could create a radically different way of doing business lost for all the reasons crypto could one day win. Thankfully, crypto’s remaining builders and founders have realized the idea that “code is law” isn’t enough on its own to keep out or punish bad actors, and that the government still has a purpose yet.  These are exactly the type of questions and live debates that CoinDesk’s “State of Crypto” will consider, as the world watches SBF’s unfolding legal drama. While FTX has shown that one person, or a polycule of people, can wreck a lot of havoc, building back needs to be a collaborative effort between crypto founders, policymakers and users. It’s not clear whether U.S. regulation could have prevented FTX, though worth noting some jurisdictions around the world appear to have been harmed less.  It’s unlikely fraud will ever be totally eliminated out of crypto. Such a goal would never be set for any other industry. As with anything where people are still a fundamental part of operating a technology, things can go wrong. The goal, instead, is how to better prevent people like SBF from taking as much control as he did.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/10/16/where-is-crypto-policy-heading-in-a-post-ftx-world,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7836b10808c4f23a7012c3ffe5b6a53d933d0ac9-4032x2268.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42392285,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg4diD,1697458675,The Stablecoin Bill Is a Vital Upgrade for US Financial Plumbing,"Fifteen years ago Lehman Brothers collapsed, destroying the retirement savings of millions of Americans. Congress and the White House responded to the ensuing financial crisis by passing the Dodd-Frank Act, which was meant to strengthen the financial system and protect consumers.  Heath Tarbert, former Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, is Chief Legal Officer at Circle. This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's State of Crypto Week sponsored by Chainalysis.  Today, digital currencies are poised to upgrade America’s decades-old financial plumbing, bolster the U.S. dollar, and make it easier, faster, and cheaper for families and businesses to send, spend, lend, and exchange their money. But this can happen only if Washington unites behind payment stablecoin legislation that puts financial stability and consumer safety first.  Payment stablecoins are neither niche nor novel – they form an important new base layer for today’s payments and commerce, remittances and humanitarian aid. Their rapid growth reflects their everyday, real-world utility as digital dollars move globally at the speed and scale of the internet.  The positive impact of digital dollars can have an outsized impact in communities across the U.S. Working American families disproportionately bear the burden of the high-fees related to sending and spending their hard-earned money. Contrast wiring funds with sending a text message across the country. Have you ever paid $6 and waited three days to text a loved one?  The frictionless nature of stablecoins is helping to expand financial security and inclusion to vulnerable populations here and abroad who can’t easily access brick and mortar banking. The United Nations, for example, has begun sending humanitarian assistance in the form of stablecoins to Ukrainian refugees.  Congress is beginning to grasp the stakes. This summer, several committees advanced bills to better regulate the digital asset economy, including the Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act, which the House Financial Services Committee approved on a bipartisan basis. The stablecoin measure serves as a vital foundation for the other bills.  Congress should pass that bill or another bipartisan measure that provides for the following:  Strong supervision and risk management of stablecoin issuers  Strict requirements on the assets that can be held to back digital dollars  Redemption and custody requirements that protect consumers  Robust transparency, audit, and reporting requirements  A level playing field between banks and non-banks  Appropriate roles for both federal and state regulators in chartering and supervising issuers  A ban on “counterfeit” digital dollars issued by those operating beyond America’s laws  Republicans and Democrats alike want the United States to make the rules – not follow the lead of other countries. That’s why the Senate and White House must join the House in advancing this legislation on a broad, bipartisan basis.  As a former chair of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, I join former regulatory agency heads from the Obama and Trump administrations in calling for digital asset legislation. We agree that this is an urgent issue of national security and competitiveness.  Our aging financial system is rife with friction and inefficiency. Whether it’s 3% credit card fees borne by small businesses, overdraft charges, two-day delays for clearance of checks, or waiting for paychecks, many of these costs will be eliminated by a well regulated system where payments are settled digitally and instantaneously.  Good versus bad stablecoins  Prioritizing stablecoin legislation this year will establish stringent standards and transparency measures that differentiate between trustworthy, fully-backed U.S.-based stablecoins and those issued offshore with questionable practices and no safeguards to mitigate risks. Prohibiting what are in effect “unstable” stablecoins, or arguably even counterfeit dollars, would protect consumers both here in America and abroad.  The collapse of a global stablecoin without adequate backing could have severe implications for financial markets and the broader American economy. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has warned about this risk, and it's why the President’s Working Group on Capital Markets urged Congress to swiftly enact stablecoin legislation nearly two years ago.  China and Russia are working feverishly to develop digital assets in their own currencies. Stablecoin legislation will protect the dollar's primacy as the global reserve currency. The dollar’s privileged status keeps borrowing costs low, deploys our democratic values overseas, and provides a buffer during periods of economic stress.  By prioritizing stablecoin legislation, Congress can establish clear, coherent standards to protect consumers, improve financial stability, and advance the dollar as the internet’s preeminent currency. This critical piece of financial plumbing is needed first to ensure that America’s digital asset markets become the envy of the world.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | COMMODITY | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Heath Tarbert,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/10/16/the-stablecoin-bill-is-a-vital-upgrade-for-us-financial-plumbing,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9267f5793d639f7a6568098f6423e40fb90a7c63-6139x3453.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Latest News: Bitcoin Momentarily Hits $30K on False Spot ETF Approval Report, Leads to $100M Liquidations  Top Stories  On Friday, a person familiar with the matter said the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission wouldn’t appeal its loss in the Grayscale case. “The SEC’s decision not to appeal against a ruling that it was wrong to reject a spot BTC ETF is a clear testament that regulatory dynamics in crypto are evolving,” said Lucas Kiely, chief investment officer at Yield App in a note to CoinDesk. “While this by no means guarantees that Grayscale will convert its bitcoin trust into an ETF, the move does allow Grayscale’s application to move forward,” Kiely said. “It also opens the door for further spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., which could potentially narrow the gap with Europe and Canada, where ETFs have already gained traction with investors.”  Bitcoin (BTC) jumped about 4.5% in Asian morning hours Monday on optimism a bitcoin exchange-traded fund could get approved in the coming months, sparking bullish expectations. Bitcoin traded just under $28,000, reversing all losses over the past week. The jump seemed to be a continuation of Friday’s reaction to the SEC’s decision to not appeal the recent Grayscale ruling. As well as a pump in bitcoin prices following the news, the widely tracked crypto market indicator ""GBTC discount"" narrowed to its lowest in 22 months on Friday. On Friday, shares in Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) traded at a discount of 15.87% to the trust's net asset value, a level not seen since December 2021, according to YCharts. The discount has been steadily narrowing since reaching a record low of nearly 50% during the height of the bear market in December last year.  Australia expects to release draft legislation that covers licensing and custody rules for crypto asset providers by 2024, and once the legislation becomes law, exchanges will have 12 months to transition to the new regime, the country’s Treasury announced on Monday. The timeline indicates it could take until 2025 for an Australian digital asset platform to receive a license under the regime. Still, the development represents a significant step taken by the Australian government towards framing a crypto regulation policy.  Chart of The Day  The chart shows bitcoin's price, open interest in perpetual futures and the ratio of perpetual futures open interest to market cap (lower pane) since early 2022.  The ratio has recently risen in the past two weeks, signaling an increase in the degree of leverage used in the market.  The increase in leverage may show traders positioning themselves in anticipation of the SEC making an appeal on the Grayscale ruling, Blockware Solutions said. The deadline expired midnight Friday.

18912164,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=555524,1697457606,Elliott Wave Theory Forecasts XRP Price Of $27 By 2026: Crypto Analyst,"Renowned crypto analyst Egrag presented a compelling Elliott Wave analysis on the potential XRP price trajectory in a tweet today. Drawing attention to the inner workings of the Elliott Wave theory, he highlighted that XRP has entered Wave 3 in recent days, which in particular plays a transformative role in determining the course of asset prices. In Egrag’s words: “XRP aiming to $27 – Wave 1 inside Wave 3: Diving into the Elliott Wave theory as we explore the potential for XRP to reach $27! Wave 3 is typically a game-changer in the Elliott Wave theory.” Elliott Wave Analysis: Wave 3 The crypto analyst further elaborated that Wave 3 emerges as the trend’s dominant force, outshining other waves in size and influence. This stage often witnesses positive news that prompts fundamental analysts to revise their outlook, giving a boost to upward momentum. Notably, prices tend to shoot up rapidly during this phase, with minimal corrections. Investors who try to enter the market on a pullback often find themselves missing out as the third wave gains traction. At the outset, pessimistic news might still dominate, with most market participants maintaining a bearish stance. However, as Wave 3 unfolds, a significant shift towards bullish sentiment becomes evident among the majority. Related Reading: XRP Price Could Get A Boost, Dip In This Bitcoin Metric Suggests New Rally Deep-diving into the XRP analysis, Egrag points out that the green wave count reflects the Grand Cycle spanning from 2014 to 2018. This cycle commenced with Wave 1 and was succeeded by a corrective Wave 2. “Presently, XRP finds itself amidst the thrilling currents of Wave 1 within the Grand Cycle’s Wave 3. Prepare for a fascinating journey ahead!” he noted. He further elucidated that XRP has adeptly navigated through the initial waves and is now setting its course for the anticipated Wave 3, which he predicts will touch the Fibonacci 1.618 mark at $6.5, followed by a brief correction. The subsequent and concluding phase, Wave 5, according to Egrag’s analysis, will propel the XRP price to a staggering $27. A Deep-Dive Into Egrag’s XRP Price Chart Egrag’s analysis delineates the intricate voyage of the XRP price through the conceptual lenses of the Elliott Wave theory. The chart starts its narrative in March 2020, when the subordinate Wave 1 began. This initial phase witnessed XRP escalating to a prominent peak of $1.96, buoyed by a favorable outcome in Ripple’s legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Subsequent to the apex of Wave 1, the chart navigates through a territory marked by correction, which is dubbed Wave 2. In this segment, the XRP price experienced a pullback and dropped to a low of $0.4313. This corrective phase, although incisive, respects the sanctity of Elliott wave norms by not falling below the initial point of Wave 1. Related Reading: How Low Can XRP Price Go Before It Skyrockets To $5? Analyst Forecasts With the transition into the Wave 3 area, bullish momentum is currently starting to build up. Egrag, with a combination of analysis and foresight, expects the XRP price to rise beyond the zenith of Wave 1 and target the Fibonacci extension of 1.618, valued at around $6.57. This upside, plotted on Egrag’s chart, is expected to end sometime in 2024 or 2025. Wave 4, as described by Egrag, provides for a corrective move following the upswing of Wave 3. At this point, the XRP price is expected to drop heavily and find support at $1.96, which interestingly mirrors the peak of Wave 1. In Egrag’s chart, Wave 5 emerges as the pinnacle of the bull market. In this decisive phase, the analyst projects his most audacious forecast for the XRP price trajectory.

42392294,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg4eXV,1697457327,‘Elizabeth Warren Chalked the Field’: Former Congressmen Tim Ryan (D) and David McIntosh (R) on the Prospects for Crypto Legislation Before the Election,"If you’re a politician, this isn’t an easy time to come out supporting crypto. Especially in the wake of the FTX collapse, it might seem more expedient -- and safer -- to make crypto a punching bag than endorse it as a promising industry.  Senator Elizabeth Warren, in the most famous example of this, declared on twitter that she’s recruiting an “anti-crypto army.” And as the 2024 election approaches, the nation somehow grows even more polarized. Is the moment of blockchain bipartisanship dead? Is there no chance for sensible policy and regulation?  This interview is part of CoinDesk's ""State of Crypto Week"" sponsored by Chainalysis.  Not if former Congressmen Tim Ryan, a Democrat, and David McIntosh, a Republican, have anything to say about it. “The technology itself has tremendous potential for economic growth and innovation,” says former Rep. McIntosh. “But what’s happened in the United States is that we have a regulatory system led by Gensler that is very anti-blockchain technology, so it’s pushing the innovation and the capital for this new technology overseas.”  So McIntosh and Ryan are spearheading the Blockchain Innovation Project, which has a goal of advancing bipartisanship, educating their colleagues, and ultimately enacting sensible crypto policy. They know it’s an uphill battle. Ryan acknowledges that Senator Warren “chalked the field” with her forceful anti-crypto message, and says that unfortunately the “extremes define the entire party.” This is why he thinks it’s so important to get more of the Left to appreciate the merits of blockchain technology, and thinks that “we seeing more and more Democrats come online.”  In a recent Zoom call, McIntosh and Ryan share what their “magic wand” crypto legislation looks like, how they think the 2024 election will impact their efforts, why Ryan thinks the Biden administration has been “hostile” towards crypto, and they ultimately share their predictions as to whether we’ll soon see any actual hard policy.  (Spoiler: One is optimistic, one is not.)  Interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.  Let’s start with the current state of play in Congress. How does the lack of a Speaker impact the push for sensible crypto regulation?  Former Congressman David McIntosh (R): From the Republican side, [Interim Speaker Rep Patrick] McHenry is very a strong proponent of having reasonable regulations, and setting up a structure where blockchain technologies and digital finance can thrive in the United States. He and his committee have several bills; we've supported a couple of them.  You have several of the Democrats and committees support what McHenry has done, whereas in the Senate, and forgive me, Tim, if I get a little partisan on this, but you've got Elizabeth Warren acting as somebody who is dead-set against any legislation that would open up the private markets. And so in the Senate, you're not going to see any headway. You need the House to act first.  Former Democratic Congressman Tim Ryan (D): The sooner we could get things stabilized in the House, the better, because we are seeing progress. You know, we had Congressman Torres up in New York (Rep. Richie Torres), and Steve Horsford, who's the head of the Congressional Black Caucus, all vote with McHenry in committee.  So, I think the educational process of what we're trying to do publicly is starting to work. Some of our op-eds have me, for example, take a stand against the Democratic administration, because we believe so strongly that this is an important technology. I think more and more Democrats are focusing on that. We just need some stability in the House, so we can create an environment where you can get a bipartisan win on an emerging technology that is good for the country.  How would you characterize the White House’s approach to blockchain and crypto? Friendly? Not friendly?  Tim Ryan: Well, I would say it's been hostile. I've been in government for 20 years in the House. I recognize that what we saw with Sam Bankman-Fried and all of that is absolutely wrong. There's nobody defending what he did. But then they use that as an excuse to go after what could be a blockbuster technology for America.  We're supposed to be adults who should understand that the opportunities far outweigh the costs. We're looking for a regulatory environment, that's what the industry's asking for.  David McIntosh: I agree completely with Tim on all counts. Actually, when the administration first started, there were some fairly balanced things that were being produced out of the White House. But I think they've allowed the anti-crypto forces to emerge. You've seen a very sloppy environmental research paper that went after Bitcoin mining. I don’t know that they actually retracted it, but the peer review indicated the studies they cited were fabricated. It became political rather than data-driven. They lost track of the fact that this industry could be a tremendous job creator.  How do you think that the upcoming presidential election will impact possible crypto regulation?  David McIntosh: On Republican side, I don't think the candidates have really thoroughly thought this through. I've heard conversations about being against the Central Bank digital coin. That's a sort of emerging consensus, but it hasn't risen to the level where a lot of them are talking about it.  Honestly, I think the best chance for blockchain to have a promoter running for president -- and that would be helpful -- is if either party moves a generation down.  That’d be helpful for a lot of reasons!  [All chuckle.]  David McIntosh: Yeah. And you can pick who you want, right? But I think if that happens in either party, you're more likely to get somebody who appreciates and understands it.  My analogy is the 1990s, when you saw tremendous innovation happening out in Silicon Valley. And traditionally that was a more Republican area. Bill Clinton, when he ran for president, understood this innovation could be enormously powerful and on the political side, could create a bunch of supporters in California that could help him win the state. I was posted then with the Bush administration. We were seeing traditional companies that made chips decide they were going to support Democrats, because they were more in favor of the tech industry. So I’d like to see people in each of our parties competing to be activist proponents for this technology.  It's a sign of the times where the extremes define the entire party  If you could wave a magic wand, what would you want to see with crypto regulation?  David McIntosh: Oh, great question. I'd like to see a very, very clear set of rules on the financial side of what you need to take a new product, or a new coin to market. Very clear ways that companies like Coinbase can set up an exchange and abide by the rules.  Right now, there are no clear structures to do that, and so they are being regulated by enforcement actions, which means they don't have any clarity. There are so many good actors in this area who want to produce a good product, want to sell it to people in good faith. But in the absence of the rules, they don't know what's allowed and what's not allowed. By the way, that allows the fraudsters to get away with a lot more, right? Because they just go and pocket the money and leave the market.  So, the current way that Gensler's going at it makes the consumer and the investor much more vulnerable. Because now someone can enter the market, commit the fraud and leave. And it's a terrible strategy. So, clear rules is one of them. I'd like them to be lightly regulated so that innovation could occur so you don't have to pre-clear things to get them into the marketplace. But they're enough to protect the investor and the consumer.  Tim Ryan: I agree with David, and I think that's the magic of what we're doing here with the institute. He's with Club for Growth and I'm a Democrat from the other side, but we both are agreeing on enough regulation to allow protections, but not too much that you're going to stifle innovation. That should be the common sense American position.  And I think where we're getting in trouble here is when regulators fail to sit down with some of these businesses. Ideally you try to sit down and have some kind of relationship with the industry that you're regulating. Not to be in bed together, but to understand each other. And that's what's so difficult with the hostility, is there’s no real attitude of trying to understand the business. If that’s a political play, fine, but then you’re putting politics ahead of what's in the best interest of the country.  We want to make sure that this continues to be an American technology. And if we continue down this path, it won't be, and it'll be the Americans who suffer, American businesses who suffer, and ultimately American workers who suffer, because we won't be driving the investments or creating the efficiencies that we can with this kind of technology.  The American DNA is innovation, and that's how our capital markets work. And now there's money in blockchain and there's money in bitcoin and there's money that people can have to invest in the next generation of technologies, and all the venture funds that are popping up. Why would we stifle that when we’re only scratching the surface, and we don’t even know how far this thing can go?  David McIntosh: The regulators are monitoring everything the banks do. The pressure they put to de-bank digital finance is bad policy, but it's also wrong in the sense that you don't want the banking system picking winners and losers, and you shouldn't have the government regulators pressuring them to do that.  We've seen it done for various political things, such as banking and the gun manufacturers. If that trend continues, then you’re going to see every political fight get turned into a finance regulation fight. And that's a disaster for the free market and the banking system.  One of the most outrageous things I heard about, and this came from New York regulators, is that banks in New York have been de-banking people because they have a Coinbase account. To me that’s wrong. They shouldn't do it. And they certainly shouldn't be pressured by regulators in New York or Washington to engage in that kind of activity.  How confident are each of you, on a scale from 1 to 10, that we’ll have crypto policy legislation before the election next year? With 10 being rock solid confidence, and 1 as no chance in hell.  David McIntosh: Before I give you a number, let me just say it gets harder as you get closer to the election, right? So, I'd say I'm an optimist. I'd say a seven that something can pass.  Before the election?  David McIntosh: Before the election.  Congressman Ryan?  Tim Ryan: I’m at 4.5.  Whoa! Why no optimism?  I just think there's a lot of uncertainty and it's an educational process, and that's part of why we're trying to hit the gas pedal with this [Blockchain Innovation Project] and showing this coalition that we have.  I think we can move the needle a little bit on it, and hopefully before the election, but then also there may be something in a lame duck session, depending on how the politics play out. So I wouldn’t necessarily say we can't do it next year. And I think there may be a chance after the election, too, so we just want to set the table and do the best we can at this point.  One last question. It feels like crypto used to be a truly non-partisan issue that didn’t fall along the normal party lines. But has that shifted? You guys are doing bipartisan work, and I personally love that, but it does feel like there has been a shift towards Republicans being more crypto-friendly, and Senator Warren leading the anti-crypto pact on the Left. Would you agree with that? And Congressman Ryan, thoughts on what the Left should be doing, in terms of not ceding the turf of crypto to the Right?  Tim Ryan: Well, I think it's a sign of the times where the extremes define the entire party in one sense or another. And I think that's what happened. Elizabeth [Warren] came out early and kind of chalked the field, I guess you could say, around the issue. So that’s why we've got some work to do. But as we make our case, we are seeing more and more Democrats come online. We just need to reverse what she did coming out of the chute, and that's very doable. That's very doable.

42392293,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg4eNF,1697454990,GameFi Token BIGTIME Rallies 250% in First Week; Analysts Raise Supply Concerns,"BIGTIME has surged 250% in just five days.  The blockchain-based game is fast becoming in accessible to new players, one observer said.  The token's FDV to market cap ratio suggests supply inflation ahead.  BIGTIME, the native token of blockchain-powered multiplayer game Big Time, has more than tripled in the first week of its existence. The market-beating performance does not convince some analysts.  Last Wednesday, the cryptocurrency went live on several exchanges, including OKX and Coinbase. Since then, its market price has risen by 254% to $0.251, reaching a high of $0.32 at one point on Friday, Coingecko data shows. In the past five days, the total crypto market capitalization has increased just 2% to $1.056 trillion.  Big Time takes its players on a journey through different eras, with a cosmetic-based economy that puts control of the creation and selling of cosmetics or non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in the hands of the players. To start crafting, players first need SPACE or Big Time's version of virtual land, with utility NFTs – Armory, Forge and Time Warden – attached to it.  Time wardens are workshops for crafting, upgrading and recharging hourglasses, one of the most sought-after NFTs, that players need to receive BIGTIME tokens.  BIGTIME tokens can be used to craft Forge, Armory and enter exclusive zones called prestige portals. The cryptocurrency has a total supply of five billion and can be acquired through in-game drops. Players intending to collect BIGTIME need to equip themselves with hourglass collectibles as they go through adventures.  Per Delphi Digital, only 5% of the total supply has been airdropped to players and is being traded in the open market, which has likely skewed demand-supply dynamics in favor of the bulls. The price boom, however, could be short-lived.  ""The token price could be propped up by limiting the circulating supply for a time, but it will inevitably dump this early into the game’s lifecycle, and the reputational damage is going to be hard to come back from. This will soon illustrate the risks associated with launching a fungible token too early in a game’s development cycle before there are enough players to absorb the sudden increase in supply,"" Delphi Digital said in the weekly report published Friday.  The report said that long-term players now earn as much as $200 to $2,000 per day, so playing the game for fun is no longer a consideration and there is strong incentive to cash out.  ""When faced with the option to kill in-game boars in order to earn enough gold to upgrade a piece of armor or to do the same amount of work for an almost instant cash payout if all else remains equal, most rational players would choose the latter. This is almost exactly what has happened in Big Time,"" Delphi noted, adding that the game is fast becoming in accessible for to new players due to a sharp rise in the price of NFTs needed to collect BIGTIME.  The token's fully diluted value relative to market cap is quite high, indicating a supply inflation and potential sell-side pressure.  ""The tokenomics are quite dubious. No one is sure about the exact market cap. The FDV is ridiculously high at around $1.2 billion, while the market cap is much lower at around $40 million,"" blockchain sleuth Loch said on X.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/10/16/gamefi-token-bigtime-rallies-250-in-first-week-analysts-raise-supply-concerns,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cd484ee53fa6f5bfbd769b7a099c228cef6f42bd-1767x1148.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Unveiling Data-Backed Insights,"XRP, the cryptocurrency at the center of a high-stakes legal clash between Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has remained under the cloud of uncertainty, with its price trajectory impacted by the twists and turns of the legal battle. Ripple, the company behind XRP, celebrated a legal win when a court ruled that XRP was not a security, providing a temporary reprieve for the embattled cryptocurrency. Nonetheless, market participants are acutely aware that the final resolution of this case could hold the key to XRP’s future value and trajectory. Recent analysis of the XRP price chart suggests a potential shift in the market sentiment, indicating that XRP might be on the cusp of an upward trend after a prolonged period of decline spanning over three months. Related Reading: Trillions In Shiba Inu On The Move: What Lies Ahead For The Meme Coin? XRP Current Support Level As Short-Term Optimism The examination of the recent price movements has unveiled a critical finding—XRP has gravitated towards a pivotal support level, steadfastly hovering around the $0.473 mark. Market observers are closely monitoring this level, recognizing its significance in determining the short-term trajectory of the cryptocurrency. Historically, such support levels have proven instrumental in preventing further plunges, acting as a barrier against steep declines. A sustained position above this critical line could signal the presence of a strong buying interest, potentially fueling an optimistic outlook for XRP. XRP market cap currently at $26.3 billion. Chart: TradingView.com However, a concerning element has emerged from the analysis of the price chart—the ominous “death cross” phenomenon, which has been looming on the horizon. In technical analysis, the death cross occurs when a security’s short-term moving average crosses below its long-term moving average, suggesting a potential bearish turn for the asset. XRP enthusiasts and traders are now closely scrutinizing this development, cautiously considering its implications for the future price movements of the cryptocurrency. XRP’s Resilience Amid Legal Uncertainty Meanwhile, a closer examination of the volume bars presents a more nuanced perspective. These bars represent the volume of XRP traded on specific days, offering insights into the buying and selling patterns associated with the cryptocurrency. Despite the tumultuous legal environment and the price fluctuations, the volume bars do not reflect an overwhelming surge in selling volumes, providing a glimmer of assurance for XRP holders and market participants. As of the latest market data, the current XRP price, as per CoinGecko, stands at $0.482482, showcasing a 24-hour gain of 1.4% despite a seven-day loss of 4.2%. These fluctuations, though reflective of the ongoing market volatility, underline the resilience of XRP in the face of the regulatory storm, as well as the cautious optimism brewing among traders anticipating a potential upward shift.

The law requires California's Department of Financial Protection (DFPI) and Innovation to create a regulatory framework for crypto. The framework includes a licensing regime and gives the department enforcement and rulemaking authority over the sector. The DFPI also gets an 18-month implementation period to ensure ""the adopted regulatory framework can be thoughtfully tailored to address industry trends and mitigate consumer harm,"" the letter said.  Latest News: Crypto World Cautiously Hopeful as California Acts in Absence of U.S. Feds  ""Ambiguity of certain terms and the scope of this bill will require further refinement in both the regulatory process and in statute to provide clarity to both consumers, regulators and businesses subject to this new licensure framework,"" Newsom said in the letter.

42392296,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg4eSN,1697450438,Bitcoin Gains Spark Bullish Call of ‘$15T Asset;’ BTC Forks Jump,"Bitcoin (BTC) neared the $28,000 mark early Monday before retreating as crypto bulls seemed to bet on hopes of a major spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) going live in the U.S. in the coming months.  Bearish trades among bitcoin futures cost traders some $27 million within a few hours on the move during Asian morning hours. Open interest – the number of unsettled futures contracts, which may indicate market liquidity – rose 6.7%, showing improved trader participation over the past 12 hours.  Popular crypto investor Anthony Scaramucci, the founder and managing partner at SkyBridge Capital, said in a podcast he expected bitcoin to eventually become a $15 trillion asset over the coming years, calling it “more valuable than gold.”  Bitcoin led gains among major tokens, with Solana’s SOL and Tron’s TRX also climbing. SOL jumped as a bankruptcy estate for beleaguered crypto exchange FTX – which holds billions worth of SOL – staked nearly 10% of its holdings, damping fears of a token sell-off.  Among other alternative tokens, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Bitcoin SV (BSV), both bitcoin forks, gained as much as 11% while crypto casino Rollbit’s RLB tokens surged as much as 14%.  Elsewhere, crypto game Big Time’s BIGTIME tokens jumped 350% shortly after listing on influential exchange Coinbase (COIN). However, analysts at Delphi Digital said they considered the token an ""extremely risky asset to be trading right now.""

18908149,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=555531,1697450413,By The Numbers: Bitcoin Hashrate Poised To Complete 100% Growth In 2023,"As analysts continue to debate the future of the flagship cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, the network’s hashrate has seen exponential growth, with this key indicator poised to experience an 100% increase (from the beginning of the year) before the year runs out. How Bitcoin’s Hashrate Has Grown The hashrate, which is used to measure the computational power used to mine and process transactions on the network, currently (at the time of writing) stands at 445 exahashes per second (EH/s). This figure represents a significant increase, considering that the network hashrate stood at 255 EH/s on January 1, 2023. Related Reading: On-Chain Tracker Notices Major Difference Between Bitcoin And Ethereum Whales Hashrate almost 100% up | Source: CoinWarz These figures mean that the network hashrate has grown by 190 EH/s since the year began, and at this rate, it could well hit 510 EH/s by the end of the year, signaling a 100% increase from when the year began. These figures also suggest that more miners have jumped on the Bitcoin blockchain, with it being faster and more secure as a result of this. At this rate, the hashrate could also well be on the way to fulfilling some of the predictions made by analysts. In March, A research analyst at River Financial, Sam Wouters, noted the impressive growth rate and predicted that Bitcoin’s hashrate could reach a “Zettahash by the end of 2025.” A Zettahash is equivalent to 1,000 EH/s. Going by this current rate, some have noted that Wouters’ prediction could become a reality by December 23, 2025, or the beginning of 2026. Despite this significant growth rate, it is worth mentioning that Bitcoin’s hash price has remained rather tepid during this same period. Hash Price refers to the revenue generated by miners on a per tera-hash basis. Related Reading: How Ripple’s Rumored Token Burn Could Affect The XRP Price The hash price currently stands at close to $60, almost the same figure as at the beginning of the beginning of the year. Notably, Miners’ biggest payday came on May 8, 2023, when the hash price was $125. Where The Bitcoin Hashrate Is Coming From In his tweet back in March, Wouters also tried to analyze where the growth in Bitcoin’s hashrate could be coming from. He shared his belief that it was unlikely that the added hashrate was coming from nation-states, as some people may suggest. According to him, the odds of nation-states providing computing power to the network and remaining a secret is low as “there are far too many people involved in running massive operations.” He concluded by stating that the source of the added hashrate was “nuanced” as it could simply be a result of factors like new models being put on the market, unused inventory going online, more facilities going live, and also entrepreneurs who are finding cheap sources before regulators step in.

42392280,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg4dIZ,1697450400,SBF Trial: What Did FTX’s Terms of Service Say About Customer Funds?,"Phase one of the trial was exciting. Former FTX exchange insiders told a jury that Sam Bankman-Fried had directed them to let his hedge fund Alameda “borrow” billions of dollars from exchange customers in a secret arrangement facilitated through internal backdoors and hidden behind falsified documents.  We seem to be moving into phase two now, with witnesses who played secondary roles in this massive alleged fraud. Friday’s testimony from BlockFi CEO Zac Prince was important but dare I say almost boring. He and other upcoming witnesses are not likely privy to salacious details like “Sam told me to commit crimes.” There are two exceptions, which I’ll get to below, but our next few witnesses are customers, an FBI agent and an Alameda employee who may or may have also been an FTX US human resources employee(?).  So let’s talk about the defense again instead. We’re still waiting for the defense’s strategy to become clear. We’ve gotten hints, as Axios’ Crystal Kim points out. A filing last week suggests the defense wants to get back to the argument that Bankman-Fried did not technically commit wire fraud because FTX’s terms of service were worded in such a way that there's no case to argue funds were misappropriated.  You're reading The SBF Trial, a CoinDesk newsletter bringing you daily insights from inside the courtroom where Sam Bankman-Fried will try to stay out of prison. Want to receive it directly? Sign up here.  We’ve heard this argument a few times already from the defense team, so I dug into what the terms of service actually said.  First off: Judge Lewis Kaplan, who’s overseeing the case, has already rejected one proposed defense witness, English barrister (basically British for “lawyer”) Lawrence Akka, from offering testimony because the defense wanted this individual to explain the English laws governing FTX’s terms to the jury, and explaining the law to the jury is the judge’s job.  In its new filing, the defense team continues to argue that FTX’s relationship with its customers “was governed by [its] terms of service,” and so “the question of whether Alameda’s use of customer fiat deposits was permissible within the scope of that relationship – and, thus, whether a theft of property occurred – is governed by foreign law,” at least with regard to counts one and three of the indictment (referring to the actual wire fraud, i.e. substantive, charges).  “It is the defense’s position that the rights and obligations of parties to a commercial relationship are not established by their expectations and understandings for purposes of the misappropriation theory of the federal fraud statutes,” the defense’s Oct. 12 went on to say.  So I dug up a PDF of FTX’s terms of service from May 2022.  According to that document, section 8.2.6, which governs FTX customers’ digital assets, holds that the “title to your digital assets shall at all times remain with you and shall not transfer to FTX trading.” While customers can’t blame FTX for loss in value due to price fluctuations, that’s not what the DOJ is alleging here.  “None of the digital assets in your account are the property of, or shall or may be loans to, FTX Trading; FTX Trading does not represent or treat Digital Assets in the User’s Accounts as belonging to FTX Trading,” section 8.2.6 (B) said.  I didn’t see the part of the DOJ filing which highlighted this section, but this section seems to contradict what the defense team is claiming in its Oct. 12 letter.  Then I took a look at the defense’s Sept. 11 letter arguing it should be able to call up Akka to explain the meaning of the terms under English law.  That letter made it clear that in the defense’s view, the DOJ is “relying on certain provisions in FTX’s terms of service,” suggesting there are other provisions that do undermine the misappropriation claim.  The Sept. 11 letter referenced a Sept. 1 filing asking for permission to introduce the entire terms as an exhibit (as opposed to just section 8.2), which in turn seemed to suggest that the question of misappropriation goes strictly to how FTX used customer fiat currency (emphasis mine).  “Among other things, the Terms of Service are relevant to whether FTX’s or Alameda’s use of customer fiat currency was inconsistent with representations to customers in the document itself and rights and obligations it sets forth regarding customer assets – and thus to whether there was any actual fraud or ‘misappropriation’ of customer funds,” the Sept. 1 filing said.  And sure enough, the “fiat currency” section of the terms of service, 8.3, is much more vague about how FTX held customer funds. FTX said it may convert fiat deposits into “e-money,” which the terms describe as a sort of internal accounting tool.  There are no clauses in this section addressing how FTX might hold customer deposits, unlike the digital assets section.  But is the DOJ only alleging that FTX stole customers’ fiat funds? No. It’s not. Assistant U.S. Attorney Thane Rehn, in his opening statement, told the jury that Bankman-Fried let Alameda withdraw FTX customers’ crypto (emphasis still mine).  “Using Alameda, the defendant withdrew billions of dollars worth of customer crypto out of the FTX digital wallet and into Alameda's digital wallet that he owned and controlled,” he alleged.  Unsurprisingly, the DOJ disagrees with the defense’s Oct. 12 argument. In its own filing, which seems to have dropped late Friday (Oct. 13), prosecutors say that “misappropriation occurs when a party breaches a ‘fiduciary duty.’” Prosecutors have already spent the early days of the trial pointing out that Bankman-Fried, through advertisements (including the infamous Super Bowl ad with Larry David) and other public appearances, said FTX was a safe and “trusted way to buy and sell” cryptocurrencies.  The DOJ filing also said “the defendant is simply wrong” that prosecutors are just arguing misappropriation. They’re also alleging Bankman-Fried made “material misrepresentations and omissions.”  If any lawyers know what I'm missing in the defense’s argument, please let me know.  The DOJ's Oct. 13 filing, interestingly, did not bring up the whole English law question, though prosecutors did express their opposition to that argument in a late August filing. At the time, the DOJ said that “framing the issue as a dichotomy” between the terms of service and other legal structures may be misleading for the jury.  Speaking of FTX’s terms of service, it’s maybe worth highlighting that on page one, the document said, “Affiliates of FTX Trading may execute trades on the Platform provided, however, that such Affiliates shall not be afforded any priority in trade execution.”  Former FTX Chief Technology Officer Gary Wang told the court that Alameda Research “had the ability to place orders slightly faster than other accounts.”  There is also a section on page 22 where the terms say “nothing in the terms shall limit or exclude a party’s liability … for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation.""  Which, sure, good detail.  Courtroom scenes  Sam Bankman-Fried spent most of Friday’s session working on his air-gapped laptop, as usual.  Zac Prince gave very lengthy answers to Assistant U.S. Attorney Nicholas Roos and defense counsel Mark Cohen, going well beyond the questions asked. He seemed almost defensive at points during Cohen’s cross-examination, when asked about BlockFi’s processes that led to its exposure to FTX and Alameda, telling the court that he was a part of the decision-making when it came to BlockFi’s loans to Alameda.  The court has set up overflow rooms when there are more reporters and members of the public than the 20 or so available seats in the courtroom. The court needed two overflow rooms on Wednesday. There was only one on Thursday but it was practically standing room only. Friday? Tons of space left over. A court security officer even asked if any reporters or members of the public wanted to enter the main courtroom.  What we're expecting  Prosecutors told Judge Lewis Kaplan on Friday that they expect to wrap up their case by Oct. 26, allowing the defense to begin (if it plans to present a case) by that Thursday afternoon. In practical terms, this means the DOJ believes its remaining witnesses will take 4.5 days to testify (reminder: there is no trial on Oct. 20, 23, 24 or 25). Note that the defense has also requested to adjourn the Tuesday, Oct. 17 hearing to deal with an issue relating to Bankman-Fried’s prescription medication.  The list of upcoming witnesses includes FTX customers Elan Dekel and Tareq Morad, former Alameda Research employee Delaney Ornelas, former FTX head of product and investor relations Ramnik Arora, former FTX director of engineering Nishad Singh and FBI agent Richard Busick. Singh and Arora are probably the most anticipated remaining witnesses. Arora likely had a key role in working with some of the investors in FTX and Alameda. It wouldn't surprise me if he's the second of the two witnesses testifying under a grant of immunity (the identity of first, former FTX developer FTX developer Adam Yedidia, was revealed the week before last). Singh, of course, is another FTX inner circle member who pleaded guilty to crimes tied to the exchange, and has emerged as a central figure in both Gary Wang’s and Caroline Ellison's testimonies as someone who communicated vital information.  Prosecutors have not yet mentioned their proposed expert witnesses Peter Easton or Andrea van der Merwe, and we haven’t heard anything more on the proposed Ukrainian FTX customer who was at dispute earlier.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/10/16/sbf-trial-what-did-ftxs-terms-of-service-say-about-customer-funds,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/84d3ca7ee2a1134decf42c38bcf6e637ea645d1f-1920x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Analyzing the current state of affairs for holders of the meme coin, it becomes apparent that the profitability of investing in this particular asset type has been a rollercoaster journey. Data derived from IntoTheBlock, an analytics firm, reveals a striking fact: a mere 9% of the current SHIB holders find themselves in a profitable position at the current value of roughly $0.0000069 per coin. This figure is indicative of the challenges that many SHIB investors are currently grappling with. Moreover, an additional 1% find themselves at a break-even point, while a staggering 91% face the harsh reality of being at an overall loss. Related Reading: Trillions In Shiba Inu On The Move: What Lies Ahead For The Meme Coin? Source: IntoTheBlock Shiba Inu’s Price Plunge: A Tale Of Highs And Lows One of the key contributing factors to this landscape of varying profitability is the undeniable influence of Shiba Inu’s price volatility and the composition of its holder base. Over the past few months, SHIB’s market value has been subject to dramatic oscillations, largely propelled by substantial trading volumes. This volatility has undoubtedly played a pivotal role in shaping the current financial positions of SHIB holders. It is also worth noting that an overwhelming 78% of the circulating supply of SHIB is concentrated within the wallets of the so-called ‘whale’ holders, emphasizing the significant influence of a few major players within the SHIB ecosystem. The plunge of Shiba Inu’s price, a staggering 92% drop from its all-time high of $0.00008616 in October 2021, has left many investors who bought at or near peak prices in a precarious position, facing significant losses. However, on the flip side, those who entered the market at relatively lower prices are potentially reveling in the positive returns yielded by their investments. SHIB market cap slightly above $4 billion. Chart: TradingView.com At the time of writing, SHIB’s price stands at $0.00000700, as per CoinGecko, showing a 1.2% gain over the past 24 hours, though still nursing a 1.0% loss over the past seven days. Can Shiba Inu Overcome Resistance? Despite the apparent challenges faced by SHIB holders, a glimmer of hope emerges from the analysis of the price trends. It is evident that every significant dip in SHIB’s value is consistently followed by a period of recovery, creating what appears to be a repetitive “zig-zag” pattern. SHIB two-week price action. Source: Coingecko Related Reading: Cardano Yearly Support: The Key To A 15% Price Breakout? This pattern is indicative of a healthy correction process, a natural phenomenon within the realm of cryptocurrency markets. It speaks to the resilience of SHIB and its ability to bounce back from adversities, offering a ray of optimism amidst the prevailing uncertainty. Furthermore, the current market dynamics suggest that SHIB is grappling with a local resistance level, posing a formidable challenge to its upward trajectory. The interplay of reduced activity among the whale holders and the ongoing battle to overcome this resistance level implies that if SHIB manages to break through this barrier, a bullish trend could be on the horizon.

Validators verify transactions by locking up ether in exchange for rewards. The blockchain’s Shanghai upgrade allowed for the withdrawal of staked ether for the first time.  With the validator entry at peak capacity in recent months, staking yields have dropped to 3.5% from more than 5%, the report said.  “The yield on staked ether provides a floor for the crypto ecosystem,” wrote analysts David Duong and David Han, “providing a benchmark for alternative crypto investments.”  If underlying activity and transaction fees remain consistent on the network, Coinbase says it expects the staking yield to remain flat now that validator growth has slowed.  Activity on the Ethereum mainnet held steady during the third quarter, while its total rollup transactions increased, the note said.  “With no major Ethereum protocol upgrades until Dencun, which is likely to occur in the first half of 2024, we see no major technical drivers that would meaningfully impact onchain activity – barring major new protocols or egregious hacks,” the report added.

18904098,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=555481,1697443234,"Bitcoin Price Soars To $28,000, Here’s Why","The world’s leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC), has seen a significant surge in its price today, reaching $28,004. While several factors have contributed to this jump, here are the primary reasons: #1 SEC’s Non-appeal On Grayscale Spot Bitcoin ETF Late on Friday night, the market became aware of the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s decision not to appeal the verdict which favored Grayscale’s conversion of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot ETF. This decision wasn’t perhaps fully priced in on Friday, as Bitcoin’s price rose by a mere 1.2% on Friday ((followed by a fast retracement), in stark contrast to the 8% spike on August 29 when the initial ruling was announced. The move signifies the SEC’s potential readiness to green-light a Bitcoin ETF in the imminent weeks. As one Grayscale spokesman pointed out, “The Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure’s 45-day period to seek rehearing has now passed. The Grayscale team remains operationally ready to convert GBTC to an ETF upon the SEC’s approval.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Path To $70,000? Analyst Shows What This ‘Head And Shoulders’ Pattern Reveals James Seyffart from Bloomberg Intelligence highlights the probable talks between Grayscale and the SEC in the near future, stating, “Dialogue between Grayscale and SEC should begin next week. Hoping for more info on next steps sometime next week or week after?” As for when a Spot ETF is coming, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts predict a staggering 90% chance of the SEC’s approval by around January 10. #2 BTC’s Correlation With Gold Renowned analyst MacroScope recently provided in-depth insights into the complex relationship between gold and Bitcoin which may have contributed to today’s price move. Gold has soared by more than 6.5% from October 6 till Friday last week, driven by a combination of elements such as central bank policies, the US’s fiscal challenges, and unfolding geopolitical events like the Israel-Hamas war. Remarkably, the Gold market has been witnessing a discernible pattern: savvy investors, often labeled as the ‘smart money’, have been strategically capitalizing on price dips to augment their long positions. This behavior has been particularly pronounced around the $1820-1860 price marks, suggesting a foundational shift in gold’s pricing trajectory. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts Next Bitcoin Cycle Top – Is It $89,000 Or $135,000? This evolving dynamic in the gold market bears significant implications for Bitcoin. Historically, gold often pioneers a trend, with Bitcoin tailing behind to emulate it. This lead-lag relationship, as highlighted by MacroScope, might have been pivotal in forecasting Bitcoin’s move today. As gold appears to be charting a bullish course, Bitcoin, while influenced by its distinct set of catalysts like the spot ETF approval, could be poised to mirror gold’s trajectory. #3 Short Squeeze Finally, on a more technical note, there has been significant activity in the BTC futures market that played a part in the soaring price. Thus far today, about $20 million in short positions have been liquidated, the highest amount since October 1, when $37.5 million in shorts were liquidated and BTC rose 4% from $27,000 to nearly $28,100 in a very short period of time. In conclusion, Bitcoin’s impressive surge to $28,000 can be attributed to a combination of regulatory developments, its correlation with gold, the increasing influence of big holders or ‘whales’, and significant futures market activity. At press time, BTC traded at $27,880.

Over 5.5 million SOL, worth $122 million at current prices, and just over 24,000 ETH, worth $30 million, have been staked, separate transactions viewable on the blockchain show.  Staking refers to locking up crypto holdings on a blockchain to help maintain the network in turn of token rewards. The move may help the estate earn a significant amount over the next few years as rewards are generated on the staked positions.  On-chain watchers on social app X citing the data said the SOL seemed to have been staked on Figment, where it will earn 6.79% annualized on the holdings – or over $8 million in SOL tokens which gets compounded.  Ethereum transactions show the ether was staked directly on the network, where it’s set to earn 3.4% annualized currently – or $1 million in ETH tokens.  FTX was an early investor in Solana and regularly receives a significant volume of SOL unlocked according to a planned vesting schedule.

On Friday, shares in Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) traded at a discount of 15.87% to the trust's net asset value, reaching the level last seen in December 2021, according to YCharts. The discount has been steadily narrowing since reaching a record low of nearly 50% during the height of the bear market in December last year.  The latest improvement came as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) decided not to appeal against the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals' August verdict to set aside the regulator's decision to reject Grayscale's attempts to convert its trust into an ETF. The SEC had until Friday midnight to challenge the decision.  Grasycale and CoinDesk are part of the Digital Currency Group.  The SEC could now come up with new reasons to reject Grayscale's bid to cover its trust into an ETF or request an en banc appeal. That said, the probability appears low, considering the regulator has been actively engaging with other spot-ETF applications.  ""As far as I know, the SEC did not appeal, which means it now has to reconsider its ruling. It could deny again for different reasons - but the agency is reportedly engaging with other potential issuers, which is unusual. It is starting to feel like it is getting ready to let them list,"" Noelle Acheson, author of the popular Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, said in the weekend edition.  Nate Geraci, president of the ETF Store, voiced a similar opinion on X last week, saying the lack of appeal would mean a potential spot ETF launch in January 2024, with Grayscale probably taking the lead over other issuers.  On June 15, the world’s largest fund manager and traditional finance heavyweight, BlackRock filed for a spot bitcoin ETF with the SEC, with Fidelity, Invesco, Valkyrie Investments, WisdomTree, and VanEck following BlackRock's lead in the subsequent days.

Despite the notable price swings, the asset’s price action has failed to commit to either a bullish or bearish trend, leaving market participants uncertain about the coin’s future. A closer look at the daily chart reveals that this indecisive phase is gradually forming a symmetrical triangle pattern, potentially holding the key to forecasting the coin’s near-term trajectory. As of the most recent data from CoinGecko, Cardano is trading at 0.251940, reflecting a modest 0.3% increase over the past 24 hours, although it has experienced a seven-day loss of 2.7%. These minor fluctuations underscore the prevailing market uncertainty surrounding ADA’s price movement. Related Reading: Trillions In Shiba Inu On The Move: What Lies Ahead For The Meme Coin? Cardano Key Support: A Resilient Barrier The significance of the $0.24 support level should not be underestimated, as it has acted as a formidable barrier against significant downward moves on three separate occasions in the past four months. According to a price report, Cardano can maintain its position above this lower trendline, a moderate upswing towards the upper boundary of the triangle at approximately $0.258 could be in the cards, representing a potential gain of 5.5%. While the triangular pattern remains intact, ADA is expected to remain trapped in a sideways trend. However, should a decisive breakout occur above the triangle, it could ignite a robust 15% rally, setting its sights on the coveted $0.3 milestone. ADA market cap nearing the $9 billion level. Chart: TradingView.com In a separate report, the outlook remains bearish if buyers fail to seize control of the market in the near future. Traders should brace themselves for a potential test of the $0.24 range in the coming days, adding to the prevailing uncertainty that has kept ADA investors on their toes. ADA’s Path Ahead Taking a midterm perspective, the immediate focus should shift to the nearest support level of $0.2380. Given the absence of any convincing reversal signals at this point, a further decline to $0.23 may be on the horizon. These developments suggest that Cardano is currently navigating a challenging period characterized by price indecision and market fluctuation. ADA seven-day price movement.

42419461,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEVf3,1697433647,"Australia Proposes New Licensing Regime for Crypto Exchanges, Aims for Draft Legislation by 2024","Australia expects to release a draft legislation which covers licensing and custody rules for crypto asset providers by 2024, and once the legislation becomes law, exchanges will have 12 months to transition to the new regime, Australia's Treasury announced on Monday.  The timeline indicates it could take until 2025 for an Australian digital asset platform to receive a licence under the freshly proposed regime. Still, the developments represent a significant step taken by Australian government towards framing a crypto regulation policy.  The proposal was expected by mid-2023 after being first announced in February 2023. The delayed October consultation paper is separate from an earlier token mapping consultation paper. Token mapping is the process of identifying the key activities and functions of crypto products and mapping them against existing regulatory frameworks.  The proposal's publication coincided with a speech by Australia's Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services Stephen Jones at The Australian Financial Review Crypto Summit (AFRCM). Details of what the proposal would entail were first reported by AFR.  “Australia has been waiting for certainty over digital asset regulation so it can seek to catch up with the rest of the world,"" Michael Bacina, digital asset lawyer at Piper Alderman and Chair of Blockchain Australia told CoinDesk from the Summit. ""The approach is consumer-protection centric, with a broad net set to capture many business models not currently regulated. NFT marketplaces holding customer assets could also require licensing.""  The proposal released Monday suggests all crypto exchanges that hold more than AUD 1,500 ($946) of any one client or more than AUD 5 million ($3.15 million) in total assets would require an Australian Financial Services licence, granted by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. The paper asks questions about 32 themes and seeks written submissions by Dec. 1, 2023.  ""Swyftx would like to see a level playing field for national and overseas crypto platforms,"" said Adam Percy, General Counsel of Swyftx, a local crypto exchange. ""The Government consultation is thoughtful ... with appropriate protections and ... room for innovation.""  Additionally, the Treasury and Reserve Bank of Australia will publish a ""joint report around the middle of 2024 that will provide a stocktake on central bank digital currency (CBDC) research in Australia and set out a roadmap for future work,"" said Dr Brad Jones, Assistant Governor (Financial System) at the Reserve Bank of Australia in a speech.  Earlier this year, Australia decided to not make any decision on a CBDC for some years due to several unresolved issues that surfaced at the end of the pilot project.

First, He Needs His ADHD Meds","Sam Bankman-Fried might take the stand in his criminal trial, his defense hinted in a filing late Sunday. But his persistent lack of access to adequate medication for ADHD is complicating their decision on how to proceed.  In a letter to Judge Lewis Kaplan, defense attorney Mark Cohen said his client “has been doing his best to remain focused during the trial” despite receiving inadequate doses of Adderall from the Bureau of Prisons (BOP).  “However, as we approach the defense case and the critical decision of whether Mr. Bankman-Fried will testify, the defense has a growing concern that because of Mr. Bankman-Fried's lack of access to Adderall he has not been able to concentrate at the level he ordinarily would and that he will not be able to meaningfully participate in the presentation of the defense case,” Cohen wrote.  Read more: SBF Trial: Crypto Lender BlockFi Believed Alameda Was Solvent Given Balance Sheet It Was Shown, CEO Testifies  Prosecutors estimate they will wrap up their case at midday on Oct. 26, at which point the criminal fraud trial will turn to the defense team – if they present a case at all. Signs point to them doing so, but it remains an open question as to whether Bankman-Fried will take the stand.  Bankman-Fried’s struggle to secure his prescribed medication while in federal custody highlights how the bureaucracy of justice works against defendants. His lawyers have been fighting to get the former FTX CEO his full doses of Adderall since he was remanded in August. Their early efforts were successful but things have become more difficult during the trial, and the BOP is ignoring their repeated calls and emails.  Now the criminal defendant receives a morning dose of Adderall that has worn off by the time the jury walks into the courtroom, and nothing again until he returns to Brooklyn lockup at night, Cohen said. He’s supposed to get three to four doses of Adderall a day.  Cohen said Bankman-Fried will receive an extended release dose from the BOP every morning but warned “there is no way of knowing” how effective it will be – or if the BOP will even give it. If that doesn’t work, Cohen proposed the trial adjourn for one day to figure things out, and asked for permission to provide Bankman-Fried his medicine himself as an alternative option.",NEGATIVE,없음,OTHER,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/10/16/sam-bankman-fried-may-testify-at-trial-defense-says-first-he-needs-his-adhd-meds,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dbc6ea8357922922ccec46b2e14fb2682106be12-2068x1163.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

There was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance near $27,000 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair is showing signs of a recovery, but it could struggle near $27,300 and $27,500. Bitcoin Price Attempts Fresh Recovery Bitcoin price found support near the $26,550 level. BTC bears attempted to clear $26,550, but they failed. As a result, the price started an upside correction above the $26,800 resistance. There was a move above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $28,285 swing high to the $26,550 low. Besides, there was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance near $27,000 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. Bitcoin is now trading above $27,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. It seems like the price is facing a strong resistance near the $27,300 level.

A clear move above the $27,500 and $27,650 resistance levels could set the pace for a larger increase. Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com The next key resistance could be $28,000. A close above the $28,000 resistance might start a steady increase toward the $28,500 level. Any more gains might send BTC toward the $29,200 level. Another Decline In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to recover higher above the $27,500 resistance, there could be a fresh decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $27,000 level and the trend line zone. The next major support is near the $26,900 level and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. A downside break and close below the $26,900 support might send the price further lower. The next support sits at $26,550. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now losing pace in the bullish zone.
