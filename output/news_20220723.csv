314241,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=496537,1658602824,On-Chain Data: Bitcoin Whales With 10k+ BTC Have Been Growing,"On-chain data shows the number of Bitcoin holders with 10k+ BTC have grown recently, a sign of accumulation from whales. Number Of Bitcoin Whales Holding 10k Or More BTC Has Gone Up Recently As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, both the 1k+ and 10k+ BTC holders have observed some growth in recent weeks. Holders with 1k or more BTC are considered whales, and movement from them can have noticeable impacts on the Bitcoin market. The relevant indicator here looks at all wallets on the network to see how many own between 1k and 10k BTC and how many are holding more than 10k BTC. Now, here is a chart that shows how the holder count of these two Bitcoin whale groups have changed during the last couple of years: Looks like the 10k BTC holders have observed some very sharp growth recently | Source: CryptoQuant As you can see in the above graph, while the value of Bitcoin has been on a downtrend since November of last year, the number of Bitcoin whales with more than 10k BTC has only gone up. The 1k+ BTC holders, on the other hand, were mostly on a sideways trend until May came, where the 10k BTC whales slumped down a bit and the 1k+ holders spiked up. This could possibly be because of the former group selling off some of their supply and dropping into the 1k to 10k range. Related Reading | Ethereum Bullish Signal: 800k ETH Exits From Gemini Not long after this increase, however, the 1k+ BTC whales dropped off and the 10k ones observed a rapid growth. There could be two things contributing to this trend. First, some of the 1k+ BTC holders sold part of their supply such that their wallets went below the 1k mark. And second, many of the remaining holders rather bought more and entered into the 10k+ category. Both of these would mark as a drop in the 1k+ whale count. Related Reading | Bitcoin NUPL Shows Average Holder Back In Profit, But For How Long? However, very recently the 1k+ BTC whales have again observed some growth while the 10k holders have still been sharply trending up. This implies that the total number of whales as a whole has gone up in the market recently. Such accumulation from Bitcoin whales can lead to a positive outcome for the price of the crypto. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s price floats around $22.2k, down 1% in the last seven days. Over the past month, the crypto has gained 10% in value.

The interview took place a few days after Bloomberg revealed that FTX and FTX.US were discussing seeking new capital after going on a spending binge that saw the firm spend almost $1 billion over two weeks in June. During this period, Bankman-Fried acquired Bitvo, a Canadian trading platform, and clearing house Embed. It also got into agreements to give BlockFi and Voyager, two failing cryptocurrency companies, revolving credit lines. FTX to Deploy Open-Ended Amount Despite stating that the corporation will deploy an “open-ended” amount, Bankman-Fried added that “there is a limit.” When questioned about whether his recent buying binge fosters a monopoly, he responded that FTX is not actively pursuing this. “We would love for other individuals to be stepping in and contributing capital to those in need,” he added.

The crypto sector may still experience a few areas of pain for some exchanges and crypto funds over the next few quarters, “but at some point all of that will be done, and then we'll just be waiting for what's the next catalyst,” CEO and former TradFi banker Alan Lane told CoinDesk in an interview.  However, investors shouldn’t compare the current crypto price slide to previous ones given the broader global economic reset as digital assets have fallen with macro trends including rising rates and inflationary pressures, Lane said.  Shares of Silvergate are down 42% this year, though they’ve jumped 33% over the last week. The VanEck Digital Transformation Exchange-Traded Fund (DAPP), which holds a basket of various crypto stocks including exchange Coinbase (COIN) and miner Marathon Digital (MARA), has fallen 67% this year, but risen 15% over the last week. Rising rates and recession fears have hurt global equity markets, especially stocks deemed to be riskier. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index has retreated about 25% year to date.  Long-term positive  Given the crypto downturn, analysts anticipate a weak quarter for various crypto companies from exchanges to miners, but Silvergate’s second-quarter earnings bucked the trend.  The Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN), a fiat on-ramp for bitcoin (BTC) markets, posted a 34% rise in U.S. dollar transfers during the second quarter compared to last year, while net income rose 85% year over year.  Lane said the way Silvergate avoided the pitfalls of the bear market is by sticking to what the bank knows best and by not chasing FOMO. “We really try to stay in our lane and not chase the latest fad, but really just focus on what we do well, and essentially just solving problems for our customers,” Lane said.  Investment bank Canaccord Genuity thinks risk management was a key contributor to Silvergate’s positive earnings results. “What perhaps was the biggest long-term positive for the story was a risk management program that resulted in no loan writedowns, despite significant crypto spot price volatility and some default contagion across the broader ecosystem,” Canaccord equity research analyst Joe Vafi said in a note to clients.  Vafi also expects Silvergate to double its earnings over the next few years given various growth drivers that the company is embarking on. He rates the stock with a buy and $200 price target; shares closed at $86.50 apiece on Friday.  Bitcoin lending  Amid the recent collapses of several over-leveraged crypto-linked financial institutions, Lane remains positive on using bitcoin for its lending program.  “We're absolutely still interested in lending against bitcoin,” Lane said. “We believe that is some of the best lending we've ever done, and we want to continue to grow that.”  Most recently, Silvergate utilized its SEN Leverage program in a $205 million term loan to Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy (MSTR) so the business intelligence firm could purchase more bitcoin.  Lane said the lending platform was built with the acknowledgement it would come with volatility, and says the recent crypto rout was a good stress test for Silvergate to show it can withstand volatility in its lending business model.  Certain lenders that have had problems included those offering clients unsecured or under-collateralized loans, while Silvergate requires over-collateralization, according to Lane. If market headwinds persist, a borrower can pay down its loan, pledge more bitcoin or Silvergate can make the decision to liquidate some bitcoin on one’s behalf if necessary.  Diem launch  In January, Silvergate bought the technology and other assets from Diem, the stablecoin project from Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook) first announced as Libra back in June 2019.  “While details remain few, the assets acquired from Diem do indeed provide a solid platform for a stablecoin for e-commerce, and we cannot but believe that demand both from payments platforms and merchants could be strong over time,” Canaccord’s Vafi added in his note to clients.  Silvergate said on its earnings conference call that its stablecoin launch remains on track for this year.

Will the breakout rally cross above the $1 mark? Key Technical Points: The TWT prices jumped by 8.1% in the last 24 hours. The market value of Trust Wallet breaks above the 100-day SMA. The 24-hour trading volume of Trust Wallet Token is $409 million, indicating a hike of 38%. Past Performance of TWT As mentioned in our previous analysis, the falling channel breakout rally drives the Trust Wallet token (TWT) prices to the 100-day SMA. The breakout rally forms a symmetrical triangle pattern in the daily chart. How about the 10% jump in the last two days from the 100-day SMA results in the bullish breakout of the resistance trendline. Source – Tradingview TWT Technical Analysis The current market price of TWT trades higher above all the crucial SMAs in the daily chart, and the triangle breakout rally teases an uptrend continuation. Hence, traders can find multiple entry spots with growth potential to the next psychological mark of $1. The RSI and MACD indicators regained the bullish bias after a long-term neutral sideways trend when the prices were trapped within the symmetrical triangle pattern. The RSI slope reverses higher within the nearly overbought zone after a long sideways trend at the halfway line. The MACD and signal lines regain the balanced alignment after the lateral movement of mixed signals. In a nutshell, the TWT technical analysis displays a higher likelihood of an uptrend continuation to the $1 mark. Upcoming Trend If the breakout rally gains momentum, the TWT market price will skyrocket to the $1 mark. However, a retest of the bullish breakout might result in a price dump to the broken resistance trendline close to $0.80.

Should you keep hoping for a bullish breakout? Key Technical Points: The VET prices dropped by 1.91% in the last 24 hours. The market value of VeChain sustains above the 50-day SMA. The 24-hour trading volume of VeChain is $98.04 Million, indicating a drop of 11%. Past Performance of VET In our last article, VET prices were breaking over the 50-day SMA and keeping the momentum of the breakout rally. However, the rally fails to surpass the $0.025 resistance level, resulting in a dip to the 50-day SMA. The daily trading volume drops during the bearish retracement displaying a potential reversal to reattempt the bullish breakout. Source – Tradingview VET Technical Analysis VET price action reveals an uptrend that is lacking to go beyond the $0.026 mark due to long-wick candle formation.

The RSI indicator shows the underlying bullishness sustaining the bearish attack evident by the sideways trend above the halfway line. Additionally, the MACD indicator shows the fast and slow lines, supporting an upwards trend despite a declining tendency in bullish histograms. So, technical indicators maintain an optimistic outlook despite the higher price rejection candles.

Cardinal broke the news on Friday, stating that Solana Ventures and the recently established cryptocurrency venture capital firm Protagonist jointly led the seed round. Additionally participating were Alameda Research, Delphi Digital, and CMS Holdings. According to Cardinal co-founder and CEO Spencer Rust, “Founded eight months ago, Cardinal offers a Solana protocol with use cases such as rentals, staking, and ticketing to help improve the utility of NFTs. Rentals, for example, allow rented NFTs to “physically sit in renters’ wallets” while maintaining the impossibility of default.” 1/30 We are thrilled to finally announce our $4.4M seed raise led by @ProtagonistXYZ and @SolanaVentures, with headline participation from @Delphi_Digital, @animocabrands, and @AlamedaResearch! pic.twitter.com/fGdzd1H7vz — Cardinal (@cardinal_labs) July 22, 2022 Cardinal Released First Iteration Earlier this Year According to Rust, “many thousand rentals” have already been completed using the site since Cardinal released the first iteration of its rental marketplace earlier this year. The second version, which will have a revised user interface and experience, is anticipated to be released soon. Rust said, the business also provides “escrow-less” NFT staking, enabling stakeholders to continue enjoying any benefits their tokens may provide. We’ve observed that, among other verticals, gaming companies that desire to develop staking efforts for their customers without interfering with their ability to play the games benefit from this. According to Cardinal, their protocol has already been used to stake more than 65,000 NFTs. Cardinal currently only concentrates on Solana, but it intends to support additional blockchains in the future. At some point, Rust stated, “We have cross-chain aspirations and aim to investigate building on EVM [Ethereum virtual machine] chains and others like Near and Aptos.” Cardinal has received $5.2 million in total capital due to the seed funding round.

Crypto Rights for Texas Citizens According to the document, the Texas GOP will add protections for wealth transfer and storage to the Texas Bill of Rights that will let its citizens choose their medium of exchange, “including digital currency, gold and silver coin, bullion, cash, and a scrip.” “The right of the people to own, hold and use a mutually agreed upon medium of exchange, including cash, coin, bullion, digital currency or scrip, when trading and contracting for goods and services shall not be infringed,” reads the platform. “No government shall prohibit or encumber the ownership or holding of any form or amount of money or other currency. Explicit protections for the natural right of Texans to keep and exchange and store their wealth in the mediums of exchange of choice,” it added. Many Republican officials are eager to establish Texas as a cryptocurrency hub. The state has already been a preferred choice for crypto miners with its cheap electricity and land charges. For instance, ten industrial-scale crypto miners draw energy from the Texas power grid, according to CNBC. However, miners had to shut their operations due to the recent record heatwave in the state.
