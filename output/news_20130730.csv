42425040,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHq2rh,1375218055,BitGive and Songs of Love charities accept donations in bitcoin,"Two charities began accepting bitcoins today. A newly formed foundation called BitGive was announced, which will filter bitcoin donations through to a variety of causes. Another existing organization, Songs of Love, also announced a bitcoin donation option.  Connie Gallippi, founder of the BitGive Foundation, explained that the organization had applied for its 501c status. In the meantime, it would be collecting bitcoin donations, she said.  BitGive came out of meetings held at the Bitcoin conference in San Jose in May, said Gallippi, the sister of BitPay founder Tony Gallippi. She has spent 13 years working in the non-profit sector.  “A lot of these companies can donate on their own and I'm sure they will continue. But the idea of BitGive is that they can donate to an organized community foundation and take care of and focus on the charitable side.”  Ms Gallippi was unfazed about the haziness of tax issues surrounding bitcoin, although she was unsure about the IRS' position on the issue. “I don’t know. As with a lot of things in the bitcoin space will we have to see how they react and what they want to do with it,"" she said. She is working with law firm Perkins Coie, whose executives also spoke at the conference. “Everyone in the room is questioning regulation and what’s going to happen,"" she argued.  “If they’re a c3, then they have to issue a receipt,” said James White, director of tax issues for the US Government Accountability Office. Bitcoin's native protocol does not allow for receipts, although this may change with the introduction of Bitcoin Payment Messages in version 0.9.  “We are awaiting c3 approval, but we are using BitPay and they will provide receipts,” said Ms Gallippi.  Bitcoins go into a BitPay account, and will then sit in the account until enough funds have been amassed to begin paying out to causes. Ms Gallippi didn’t say what that threshold would be, but the stated goal is to provide a multi-million dollar investment fund.  “We are favourable to bitcoin at both ends, going in and out,” she said, adding that the group was trying to promote the use of bitcoin. However, it will also take cash donations in time, and would consider paying out cash donations to causes.  She sees opportunity in the volatility of the bitcoin market. “If bitcoin goes up in value, then any donations we get now will be worth so much more later.”  Patrick Murck, general counsel for the Bitcoin Foundation, is the president of the organization. BitPay co-founder Stephen Pair is also on the board.  The Songs of Love charity, which provides personalized songs for sick children, is also accepting BitPay payments on its site.

42425043,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHq2xh,1375214331,"Virtual currency regulatory and tax landscape unclear, say experts","Lawyers, analysts, academics and government officials debated the regulatory implications of bitcoin today – and none of them seemed to agree. In a panel at the Inside Bitcoins conference, one of the big sticking points was FinCEN’s attitude to miners. One speaker even suggested that the whole guidance could be challenged.  Following the release of the FinCEN guidance for virtual currencies on March 18, people began questioning whether bitcoin miners would be categorized as money producers.  “FinCEN will be fairly stable” said Jacob Farber, senior counsel for lawyer Perkins Coie LLP. “There will still be questions for miners and users,” he said.  “Miners are in the most unclear territory,” said Jerry Brito, senior research fellow at George Mason University’s Mercatus Center. ""Are they administrators as defined in FinCEN?” Miners who mine bitcoins and use them to purchase real goods and services are categorized as mere users. “But if they sell those coins, they do qualify,” he said.  One of the problems, said Brito, is that FinCEN issued its virtual currency guidance based on centralized currencies, whereas bitcoin is decentralized. The agency also failed to take proper comment before releasing the guidance, he said. “The guidance could be challenged.”  At least FinCEN had some guidance. The US Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CTFC) has no guidance yet, said Farber, although it has hinted that it might look at the issue.  Most states regulate money transmission businesses, other than New Mexico, South Carolina, and Montana, he said - although few have issued official guidance on virtual currencies. Other states (New York and Texas among them) are extra aggressive, and have threatened extra-territorial action against violators.  When it comes to taxation, the Internal Revenue Service has issued little guidance, says James White, Director of Tax Issues at the US Government Accountability Office. It last published some guidance on virtual economies in 2007, but hasn't zeroed in on virtual currencies. The GAO published a report on IRS guidance for virtual currency taxation recently. “They’re running to keep up,” he told CoinDesk. The GAO had recommended informal guidance to at least give the public some information about how they should report bitcoin income. The IRS agreed, but there is no timeline for publication yet.  “You’ve got a tax environment where they try to force things into tax buckets,” White said. “But they don’t always fit very well.” The alternative is to alter the regulatory framework itself, but this is a long and laborious process.  Debating the nuances of the regulation is a distraction, Patrick Griffin, head of business development for OpenCoin, told CoinDesk. “The industry has to get ahead of the messaging,” he said, touting the DATA self-regulatory organization that was announced early this morning, of which OpenCoin is a part. “The regulators are not going to get hung up on legal nuance. The first sniff they get of anything illicit moving through the system, they’ll shut it down.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | COMMODITY | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/07/30/virtual-currency-regulatory-and-tax-landscape-unclear-say-experts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d2de11ef8db97d7de3bd7d4f00e14ff349b9ef92-2560x1438.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425045,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHq33h,1375208157,"W3C advocates currency-agnostic, browser-based web payment standard","A representative working loosely with the Web’s standards body set out his vision for a web-based payments standard at the Inside Bitcoins conference today.  Manu Sporny, who works with the World Wide Web consortium (W3C), is part of a working group on Web Payments. He advocated a standard payment mechanism that would be currency-agnostic, and which would do away with traditional online payment methods such as entering credit card data, or making electronic payments which proprietary networks such as PayPal.  “Credit card numbers are effectively passwords to your bank account. You're giving that password away to every merchant you do business with,” said Sporny.  Sporny’s company, Digital Bazaar, enables individuals to sell content online. It developed an open-sourced payment protocol called PaySwarm, that he hopes to see included in the group’s activities.  “It is built on top of other core protocols of the Web (things like HTTP, JSON, URLs, etc.). It's what a financial system would look like if you took what worked on the Web and used the same approach to create a financial protocol,” he told CoinDesk.  Another component of the solution is the Web Commerce API, which is a browser plug-in to enact PaySwarm. “The developer would initiate the payment using the Web Commerce API, and the PaySwarm protocol would carry out the transaction,” he said.  The Bitcoin core developers have their own payment mechanism specific to the currency, called Bitcoin Payment Messages, scheduled for release in version 0.9 of the protocol, but Sporny criticized it as inadequate in a conversation with CoinDesk.  BPM doesn’t provide enough detail for products to make useful receipts for transactions, he argues. He would like to see receipts with separate, itemized details for purchases.  “What we'd like to do is make those receipts useful over a lifetime,” he said, adding that one-click tax filing would be a good outcome for a well thought-out payment system.  The W3C grinds slowly. The organisation, which works on standards for many web technologies including HTML and the Semantic Web, has an average four-year process to standardize payments. Sporny’s group is a community group, which is designed to develop a community around a technology, with a view towards standardizing it in the future. It is not yet a formal working group moving towards standardization. He would like to see such a group formed by the end of the year.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/07/30/w3c-advocates-currency-agnostic-browser-based-web-payment-standard,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/99b5598043030307c8a34ff39b5f0b05462fe901-2560x1438.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425068,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHq31h,1375198392,"BitInstant CEO Charlie Shrem to banks: ""We want to work with you""","BitInstant CEO Charlie Shrem extended a conciliatory hand to the traditional banking community in his keynote conference at the Inside Bitcoins conference today. He likened bitcoin to the early days of the web, adding that the early days of the cryptocurrency were like the “wild west”, but added that it is now evolving.  In the early days of the Internet, few people knew what was happening, and much of the infrastructure still had to be built, he said.  “We’re seeing all this infrastructure and entrepreneurs springing up,” he said. “It's our job to build the infrastructure; the roads and the tunnels.”  Things are beginning to change, however, Shrem added. There are hundreds of bitcoin startups, he said, adding that the startup community is already entering its second wave of greater innovation around bitcoin services, citing one initiative to create a Bitcoin ATM as a good example.  He also encouraged the community to explore bitcoin as a form of payment between countries in emerging markets, rather than as simply a bridge between bitcoin and developed markets.  He reserved part of his talk to address traditional financial services companies. “We want to work with you. BTC is not going to shut down banks. There’s huge potential for large comapnies, even SWIFT,” he said, arguing that bitcoin could be a way for banks to avoid covering debt differentials when conducting interbank transfers.  “Don't be scared of it. In terms of know your client (KYC), sure, you have to know your customer. It's really important that you follow the laws in the country that you're based in. And if you don't like them, try changing them.""  This was particularly poignant given the launch of a self-regulatory body for Bitcoin this week, of which Shrem is a member.  Finally, Shrem answered a question from the audience alluding to the website for BitInstant, his two year-old company, which was launched to offer payment processing for exchanges and merchants. The site has been down for several days after customer complaints.  “We are really excited to be launching this week. There are a lot of changes. We have been building this company layer on layer over the last two years,” he said. “Imagine a house that keeps getting built and it keeps getting wings attached to it and there's no one set of blueprints anymore. We moved out of the house, demolished it and rebuilt it.” He promised a new site, and a new, cheaper fee structure from BitInstant this week, along with new products.  “Don't be afraid to fail,” Shrem continued. “Some of the best BTC startups are second versions.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/07/30/bitinstant-ceo-charlie-shrem-to-banks-we-want-to-work-with-you,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f503b75d129ee7f6972f3c481a611789f2a84f23-2560x1438.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425047,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHq37h,1375192063,Altcoin partnership UNOCS launches Bridge service for instant merchant payments,"UNOCS, the altcoin partnership between Feathercoin, PhenixCoin and Worldcoin, has announced a new payment system. This system enables instant payments between consumers and merchants. Called UNOCS Bridge it effectively works as an escrow service where users load their account with digital currency for instant payment to merchants.  The process by which UNOCS Bridge works is similar in principal to a BTC exchange voucher or a preloaded credit card. The transaction has already been verified by the network by virtue of funding a Bridge account all before funds are passed to a merchant.  UNOCS Bridge will initially work with the three member currencies of UNOCS: Feathercoin, Worldcoin and Phenixcoin. It will also add support for Bitcoin and Litecoin, and a module to support fiat currencies will be added later on, we were told by John Manglaviti, Feathercoin's CIO.  The service is still in an alpha stage while further penetration testing is carried out. However, it will be demonstrated at today's Inside Bitcoin conference in New York.  Merchants will take advantage of the service by using custom code on their website which will appear to users as a ""Pay Now"" button. Customers will be able to click on the payment button and merchants will receive the funds on their Bridge account instantly.  The goal of Bridge is to ""take all of the nerd out of the process"". Merchants will be able to copy and paste custom code into their website. Merchants will then be able to manage and view statements on their Bridge account.  Clint Nauseda, founder of WorldCoin, explained: “We're looking to not only reach out to online merchants, but real brick and mortar business owners as well. UNOCS Bridge is one step closer to complete market integration.”  For the time being, users will still have to provision cryptocurrency on their own before they can use the Bridge, but this will change as soon as the fiat module is implemented. The process will become somewhat easier as the three member currencies of UNOCS implement Bridge support into their respective clients.  Manglaviti went on to tell us:  With a click, it'll do the exchange for you. That's not in this initial release, but that's where it's heading. Then fiat, we're doing the necessary licensing/bonding etc. This is an area that makes the partnership with Phenixcoin extremely beneficial for Feathercoin, which has been focused on the end user and that end user experience.  User accounts are split into two stores of money - one for saving and one for transactions. The transaction account has three types of (virtual) payment cards attached to them: the primary card which is limited by what is in the spending account, a secondary card which which have a daily spend limit, and one time use cards for extra protection.  Phenixcoin developer Mike Burns told us that the system has been designed to present as familiar as possible experience to non-technical users. Currently, if a merchant has a physical point of sale system, the user must enter the transaction details on their device which will create a QR code which the merchant then scans. This process will be expedited somewhat by Android and iOS apps that will be available within a week, we were told by Burns.",POSITIVE,BTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | WLD,David Gilson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/07/30/altcoin-partnership-unocs-launches-bridge-service-for-instant-merchant-payments,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/81c01be4b06f968dce11820ebc9ce7b5d3e63845-438x246.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425032,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHq2dh,1375181996,"Kickstarter pulls ""Bitcoin: The Movie"" project two weeks after launch","""Bitcoin: The Movie"", a film about bitcoin, has had its crowdfunding page pulled just two weeks after it launched.  The movie, which was to be a documentary on the socio-economic impact of the currency around the world, was raising its money using Kickstarter, the popular four-year-old crowdfunding site, based not far away from the movie team's own New York office.  Andrew Wong, the entrepreneur behind the movie, launched the crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter on July 16, and had scheduled the project to run until August 15, with a crowdfunding goal of $100,000. However, late last week, the crowdfunding site unexpectedly suspended the project. When Kickstarter pulled the plug, the movie had $15,896 pledged by 154 backers. Kickstarter works on an 'all or nothing' basis, meaning that money isn't awarded unless the goal is met.  Wong, who also assists with NY Business Expo, was baffled by the suspension. “We were not told what the issues were. That's why we paused all bitcoin-related activities, trying to figure out what's going on at this moment,” he told CoinDesk.  Kickstarter doesn't appear to have an issue with bitcoin, or with movies. On July 12, four days before Wong posted his own project, ""Life on Bitcoin – a Documentary Film"", a movie by two newlyweds charting a three-month period spent living on bitcoin alone, was funded. It received $72,995 – 104% of its goal – from 247 backers.  Kickstarter has also crowdfunded other bitcoin-related projects, such as a hardware-based paper wallet printer. It also permitted a mobile bitcoin app for iOS, in spite of Apple's banning bitcoin apps from its store (although this crowdfunding project did not reach its goal).  Kickstarter has also let far more controversial projects through the net, including a book touted as a ""seduction guide"", which many interpreted as a manual for rapists. The crowdfunding site issued a public apology after allowing the funding to continue until its goals were reached.  “While the story sounds thoughtful, we are going to decline to participate in an interview,” mailed a Kickstarter spokesperson when quizzed by CoinDesk.  Kickstarter’s FAQ says that projects can be suspended if it:  Violates or acts inconsistently with the letter or spirit of the Kickstarter Guidelines or Terms of Use.  Materially changes the stated use of funds  Makes unverifiable claims  Exhibits actions that are more closely associated with fraudulent or high-risk activity.  A suspension is never reversed, the firm says.  Surprisingly, given the nature of his movie, Wong did not have a separate bitcoin-based fundraising campaign in operation, although such crowdfunding operations are available. “We're thinking of setting that up. We haven't started with the coin-based funding yet,” he said.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/07/30/kickstarter-pulls-bitcoin-the-movie-project-two-weeks-after-launch,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0cbdeb22dcfca9b25b014085461ff2cfdd40800c-1005x561.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425035,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHq2jh,1375175053,"Bitcoin industry leaders launch DATA, a self-regulatory body for digital currencies","Luminaries in the bitcoin community have launched a self-regulatory body in an apparent attempt to gain a cohesive voice in the ongoing tussle with financial regulators.  The Committee for the Establishment of the Digital Asset Transfer Authority will ""work proactively with regulators and policymakers to adapt their requirements to our technologies and business models,"" said the new group, in an announcement earlier today.  ""We must develop and implement common risk management and compliance standards that address the public policy concerns associated with our businesses. And our firms must build risk management and compliance programs that meet those standards,"" it added.  The list of backers is a Who's Who of players in bitcoin. Tony Gallipi, CEO of payment processor BitPay, Chris Larsen, CEO of Ripple and founder of OpenCoin, and Patrick Murck, general counsel for the Bitcoin Foundation, are on board. TradeHill CEO Jered Kenna,who has been negotiating licenses with individual states for his high-net worth bitcoin exchange, is also a member.  Other members also have a vested interest in making the regulatory system work. Charlie Shrem, who will keynote at the Inside Bitcoins conference in New York today, is the CEO of the international bitcoin payment processor for exchanges and merchants BitInstant. As of early this morning, BitInstant's site was still down, after announcing earlier this month that it needed to revamp its website in response to customer feedback. BitInstant also reportedly received a letter from the New York Department of Financial Services, similar to the one received by the Bitcoin Foundation from the Californian state financial regulator.  The group published a manifesto of sorts in the early hours of this morning, outlining what it would do. These steps included:  Developing best practice anti-money laundering standards for virtual currency firms.  Serving as a source of business and technical standards for responsible conduct of financial transactions.  Identifying emerging policy concerns early on.  The group will have its own board, including members independent of the industry, it said, and it will have its own oversight process for members.  “We expect that DATA will require its members to obtain all required licenses and registrations, and that its oversight will supplement, not replace, the oversight of statutory regulators,” it continued.  Jaron Lukasiewicz, CEO of bitcoin FOREX trading platform Coinsetter, is another member of DATA. Yesterday, he launched a ""friends and family"" beta trial of his platform (essentially an alpha test, with 100 users). However, he admitted that when fully launched, the system will not initially be available to US customers – a restriction which he hadn’t envisaged when he raised a $500,000 funding round in February.  Coinsetter registered with FinCEN – a relatively painless process – but the nature of his business means that the SEC or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission will be the ultimate regulator for the company, he believes. However, this has not yet been decided. In the meantime, companies exchanging bitcoin with fiat currency in the US need to register with every state in which they wish to do business.  One choice was to ""do this the hard way – spend a million and a half dollars and 16-18 months going and getting licenses that in two years we won’t need,” he says.  Instead, the firm is targeting international customers, while courting licensed companies for potential partnerships.  “We have hired a couple of consultants, and I’m also spending all of my time hustling, calling banks. Our strategy is to form an agency relationship with an already-licensed money transmitter or hopefully a bank. I have a feeling that the bank side will work out but it’s still pretty early in the game.”  Other financial players have expressed similar plans to Coinsetter, especially when tackling notoriously harsh state regulators such as those in New York and California.  The inability to work in the US will impact Lukasiewicz’s business, he added, admitting that the future of the company rested on his ability to overcome the regulatory issues in the US or sign an agency agreement. His plight shows the urgency with which bitcoin companies need to fix the regulatory problem.  The full DATA announcement will likely take place officially at the conference today.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/07/30/bitcoin-industry-leaders-launch-data-a-self-regulatory-body-for-digital-currencies,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9220725d4bd6d661361edbae156c3aed67dc1163-800x300.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
