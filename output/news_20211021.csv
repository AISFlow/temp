42390161,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bW69uP,1634849896,Lassoing a Stallion: How Gary Gensler Could Approach DeFi Enforcement,"Earlier this week, we considered the challenges of creating viable long-term regulations for decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. These systems can ostensibly remove intermediaries from the trading of any asset represented on a blockchain, but those intermediaries have been the ones enforcing rules on behalf of regulators for the better part of a century. That means workable DeFi regulation will likely be much different in substance, and enforced differently, than current securities and finance rules.  That rethink may be years away from occurring, but U.S. regulators aren’t sitting idly in the meantime. With Securities and Exchange Commission chief Gary Gensler signaling that he’s paying attention, there’s significant expectation that enforcement actions could target DeFi well before any new regulations become official. Those enforcement actions will likely prioritize instances of clear lawbreaking, such as fraud or money laundering, taking place on DeFi systems.  This op-ed is part of “Policy Week,” a forum for discussing how regulators are reckoning with crypto (and vice versa). David Z. Morris is CoinDesk’s chief insights columnist.  They will be significant tests for the legal implications of decentralization. And they could get very, very ugly – particularly for individuals running “DeFi” systems that aren’t very decentralized at all.  Here, based on conversations with lawyers, former regulators and DeFi executives, are three key points about how things are likely to play out over coming months and years.  1. Enforcement will come before new rules.  The first ugly truth about DeFi regulation is that it will inevitably come too late. Systems like UniSwap and Celsius were built in ways that challenge the fundamental premises of conventional financial regulation, but regulators will not be quick to shift their models to conform with the reality on the ground. Meanwhile, DeFi systems continue to grow, guaranteeing they’ll face increasing scrutiny.  Jai Massari, a partner focused on trading and markets at the law firm Davis, Polk and Wardwell, predicts a three-step process of reconciling those conflicting truths. Call it the Stages of Regulatory Grieving.  “I think it starts off with enforcement,” she says, “because enforcement is easier than regulation.” Those enforcements could be similar to recent actions that have led to large fines for crypto exchanges like Kraken or services like Tether. But they could also go further to include criminal charges against individuals, on which more below.  Then we’ll begin to “see an effort [by regulators] to push these DeFi activities into existing regulatory categories,” Massari says. “But I don’t think that’s going to go well. I think it could be quite messy.”  In other words, she doesn’t expect serious consideration of a new regulatory framework that actually fits how DeFi works until after regulators spend time trying to hammer square pegs into round holes. In the U.S. context that could include jurisdictional fights between the SEC and other financial regulators.  Plenty of crypto operators will rightly view putting enforcement ahead of regulation as shutting the barn door after the horse is loose. To some extent, it’s a consequence of the shifting priorities of a new administration. Trump administration regulators, for better or for worse, made only incremental progress on laying out rules for crypto, much less DeFi, as crypto and DeFi grew from marginal to meaningful between 2016 and 2020.  There are signs regulators see things as running out of control. “It appears [Gary Gensler is] aligned with people like [Massachusetts Sen.] Elizabeth Warren that it’s the wild west, that it’s under-regulated,” says Katherine Kirkpatrick, co-chair of the Financial Services working group at the law firm King & Spalding.  Gary Gensler and Co., in other words, see themselves as trying to lasso a galloping stallion. That may lead to particularly strong enforcement tactics.  “They’re operating from the perspective of trying to solve something that’s the most egregious thing going on using traditional law enforcement tools,” Duane Pozza, a former Federal Trade Commission staffer who is now a partner at Wiley Law. “Because it means there will be fewer limits.”  2. Investigators will “Pierce the Veil” of decentralization.  In principle, DeFi protocols run without owners, leaders or managers. Much like Bitcoin, the protocols are in principle just software run by a collection of node operators or validators who neutrally facilitate transactions while collecting liquidity yield and fees.  Governance decisions, including changes to the protocol itself, could also in principle be managed by users. But there are still few examples of this in practice today; instead, the reality of “DeFi” in the present is often that it’s a fig leaf for a very clear group of core leaders who are actually in charge. The clearest evidence of this is instances where accounts, tokens or entire “decentralized” systems have been frozen or shut down.  “One of the design decisions in an autonomous system is whether there’s a kill switch,” says Stephen Palley, a lawyer focused largely on crypto regulation at Anderson Kill. “The problem with a kill switch is, what’s the liability or exposure of the person who controls it? To be truly autonomous, you can’t have a kill switch. The absence of that is a way to say you’re not responsible.”  It’s a grim irony of DeFi’s coming collision with legal reality: DeFi administrators who have been taking direct action to control problematic activity may have given law enforcement clear evidence that they’re actually the ones in charge, making themselves targets.  Particularly in cases where there is no legal entity affiliated with a DeFi platform, experts say this could lead to regulators and investigators “piercing the veil” in their DeFi enforcement actions. “Piercing the veil” is a legal term of art normally applied to prosecutions of corporate wrongdoing that target individual officers of the company, not just the legal corporation itself.  At least two recent crypto prosecutions have shown the willingness of the SEC and others to pierce the veil of crypto organizations, even those that have conventional corporate structures. One was the SEC’s charging of individuals at Ripple, including CEO Brad Garlinghouse, with an unregistered securities offering. The other was the filing of money laundering-related criminal charges against officers of BitMEX, including CEO Arthur Hayes.  Similar direct action against individuals with control over DeFi systems may not be far off. SEC chief Gensler has already made clear that he views most claims of decentralization in DeFi with skepticism. In addition to use of kill switches, law enforcement may look for evidence of control and responsibility in public representations of a protocol’s team, or control of multisig wallet keys.  3. Clarity will not come soon.  It will be extremely tricky to craft regulation that controls risks like fraud and money laundering through DeFi while preserving technological advantages like open access, self-custody and democratic governance. That could be worth the trade-off in the long term if new rules are truly crafted carefully.  “We’re at a moment where a bit of enlightened thinking about regulation, a little creativity, a little open-mindedness would result in a much better outcome,” says Jai Massari. “I think the best approach is to take a step back and think about the policy objectives we’re looking for.”  That process could easily take years. In the meantime, enforcement actions will likely ramp up, perhaps leaving DeFi creators and administrators in the difficult position of defending themselves for breaking rules that simply can’t be fairly applied to the new technology.  Even then, there’s no guarantee that competent and well-considered regulation will be the end result. As we saw over the summer with the poorly crafted reporting requirements in the U.S. infrastructure bill, there is still a large technical deficit in technical knowledge among legislators and regulators, and it can have serious consequences.  “The technological shortfall is pretty significant,” says Duane Pozza. “The lawmakers have a million other things going on. We’re far away from getting to the point of understanding DeFi. I do think the infrastructure bill was a wakeup call – at least some influential people on [Capitol] Hill had to learn, had to think through this new technology.”  That leaves an uncomfortable status quo, at least for those in the world’s largest financial market. For a period that could stretch for years, there will be no changes to U.S. financial regulations to accommodate the way DeFi really works. But at the same time, law enforcement and regulators will likely be making life very uncomfortable for anyone who could be seen as having authority or control over DeFi systems.  Unless something changes very soon, that will almost certainly push innovation in DeFi out of the United States, much as huge, centralized crypto exchanges including Binance and BitMEX found it more comfortable to center their operations elsewhere. It’s a message that at least some would-be creators are getting directly from their legal advisers.  “I might not agree with the application of certain laws to what my clients do, but I’m not the [Commodity Futures Trading Commission], I’m not the SEC,” says Palley. “I’m just a simple country lawyer and I have to call balls and strikes.  “So I spend a lot of time just telling people to stay out of the United States. I hate it, but it’s good advice.”  More from Policy Week:  Some NFTs Are Probably Illegal. Does the SEC Care?  Stablecoins Not CBDCs: An Interview With Rep.

42421030,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXBHZd,1634848787,What I Learned About Crypto Regulation From a Week in DC,"WASHINGTON – Within a 36-hour period, the first bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund (ETF) began trading, the underlying cryptocurrency hit a new all-time high and federal lawmakers dusted off their 2019-era concerns about the Facebook-linked stablecoin project Diem.  I spent most of DC Fintech Week in the U.S. capital to reconnect with people I haven’t seen in two years and put faces to folks I’ve emailed during the coronavirus pandemic but never actually met. In these conversations, I found that the policy/legislative landscape around crypto has greatly matured since my last visit. Federal lawmakers who couldn’t care less in 2019 are planning to propose legislation regulating different aspects of the industry in the coming months.  This feature is part of CoinDesk’s “Policy Week,” a forum for discussing how regulators are reckoning with crypto (and vice versa).  There’s also a better understanding of crypto. A lot of the regulatory reaction in late 2019 was focused on the then-Libra project, which was announced by social media giant Facebook that summer. Libra, at the time, was a pretty visionary project that policymakers saw as having the potential to destabilize the financial system. The project, now named Diem, has been fairly quiet over the past 10 months (this week’s news notwithstanding), and we’re seeing lawmakers focusing on broader swaths of the industry.  What happens in 2022 will depend on how the industry handles these issues and how regulators react to the industry.  It’s still early  You’d be forgiven for thinking that all of Washington, D.C., is focused on crypto issues right now. There’s been no shortage of regulators and policymakers revealing new work around crypto, whether that’s the President’s Working Group for Financial Markets’ pending stablecoin report, the Fed’s pending central bank digital currency report, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler’s increased comments on registration and regulation of crypto exchanges or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s (CFTC) recent spate of enforcement actions against industry businesses.  For all that, it’s still pretty early for the industry. A lot of lawmakers have heard of crypto, but it’s not a pressing concern for them. And this is even after the industry helped delay a massive, bipartisan infrastructure bill due to a single provision that impacted it.  The crypto industry is ramping up its engagement with Washington. In a feature for CoinDesk’s Crypto 2022 Policy Week coverage, Rob Garver wrote that companies and trade groups are increasing the number of lobbyists tasked with pushing for crypto-friendly regulations.  This engagement, however, is sort of mixed. At least one congressional staffer described interacting with newer lobbyists as being “painful,” an observation I’ve heard echoed by other industry participants.  We’re also seeing an increase in angry tweets and other social media messages directed at specific lawmakers or regulators. I’m told that these are extremely unhelpful in terms of communicating policy concerns. Great for engagement, though.  Crypto has arrived  Even if it isn’t top of mind, lawmakers and regulators are thinking more about crypto than in years past. We’re seeing this in the fact that aspiring ETF issuers are securing regulatory approvals to list retail-accessible trading products and that we are awaiting no less than three different government reports on aspects of the crypto industry that will inform policy.  One of the biggest issues may just be the differences in how different regulators or lawmakers perceive crypto. Individuals focused on consumer protection may be concerned that exchanges shut down every time the crypto markets grow volatile, while securities/commodities-focused regulators may be more worried with the quietly growing turf war between different agencies over who can regulate what.  And there is a huge amount of attention focused on the use of crypto in criminal activity such as ransomware payments.  The industry, as a collective, has to address all of these issues. Regulations are going to come regardless of whether industry acts or not. How severe these regulatory actions are may depend on how proactive the industry is.  Concerns about stablecoins are real  The concern around libra has morphed into concern over stablecoins at large. The revelation that neither tether (USDT), the largest stablecoin by market cap, nor USDC, the second most-issued U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, are fully backed by U.S. dollars held in regulated bank accounts, did little to help.  But while regulators seem to agree that something should be done to rein in stablecoin issuers, we don’t yet have a clear picture of how that might be done. The president’s working group will publish a report that may recommend creating a special purpose bank-like charter to oversee stablecoin issuers.  This charter would likely benefit stablecoin issuers and the exchanges that list dollar-pegged tokens by granting some level of legitimacy to the projects.  However, the working group will ask Congress to enact a law creating this charter, and I’m told that is not likely to happen.  The alternative is asking the Financial Stability Oversight Council to create a rule around this issue, which lawmakers and industry participants alike have opposed.  Another train of thought centers around treating stablecoins backed by commercial paper and short-term securities as money market funds, meaning something the SEC would regulate. This would likely not be great for crypto exchanges that list stablecoins like USDT and USDC (Coinbase, for example) as these firms would have to register with the SEC as a securities trading platform and abide by a specific set of rules.  This also seems to be an issue of the industry’s making, but there’s too much in flux to see how these regulations will actually develop.  I joked about how much has happened in 2021 with every person I spoke to. And yet, 2022 is shaping up to be an even more eventful year for crypto policy on several fronts. Watch this space for more heated debate in the coming months.  More from Policy Week:  Some NFTs Are Probably Illegal. Does the SEC Care?  Stablecoins Not CBDCs: An interview with Rep.

42375978,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwDJ7f,1634847863,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Drops as Indicators Show Extreme Optimism,"Bitcoin’s price slipped to the $62,000 area on Thursday as indicators suggest bullish sentiment is near extreme levels, which typically precedes a price pullback.  The cryptocurrency’s price was down about 5% over the past 24 hours after failing to sustain an all-time high of almost $67,000 on Wednesday.  The crypto Fear & Greed Index remained elevated in “extreme greed” territory, suggesting that investors who accumulated positions around the $30,000 BTC price could start to take profits.  Analysts also noted signs of excessive optimism in the bitcoin futures market, although some expect price pullbacks to be short-lived.  “Despite the recent setback, we remain very bullish about the current crypto cycle for at least another five to six months,” James Cox, CEO of Taipan Trading and Investments, wrote in a Thursday investment memo. The firm reduced trading during the September crypto sell-off and later deployed a large cash position to BTC in October.  Looking ahead, traders and analysts will be monitoring Valkyrie Investments’ bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund (ETF), which will begin trading in the U.S. on Friday under the ticker BTF.  Latest prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $62,700, -5.54%  Ether (ETH): $4,079, -0.69%  S&P 500: $4,549, +0.30%  Gold: $1,784, +0.17%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.67%  BITO trading activity surges  The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (NYSE: BITO) had significantly higher trading volume over the past two days relative to other large exchange-traded funds (ETF). This reflected strong investor demand for BITO, an ETF focused on bitcoin futures, and achieved nearly $1 billion in assets in just its second day of trading.  “The introduction of this product is a net positive for the [crypto] industry. Since ETFs are traded in all traditional brokerage accounts, BITO creates a frictionless avenue for thousands of professional financial advisors to achieve liquid exposure to bitcoin without needing to endure a learning process,” global advisory firm FundStrat wrote in a Thursday newsletter.  Indicators show extreme market optimism  The crypto Fear & Greed Index reached a six-month high over the past week, which signaled “extreme greed” among market participants.  “It’s not unusual to see the index fluctuate at such high levels,” Arcane Research wrote in a Tuesday newsletter. “Throughout the bull market from November until April, the index mostly remained in this area [current levels], with periods of decline into the fear area during sudden sharp sell-offs,” Arcane wrote.  Excessive optimism is also evident in the bitcoin futures market. For example, the average BTC funding rate, or payments to long or short traders, is at the highest level since August. Elevated funding rates often lead to temporary price pullbacks, according to CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole.  “Although a positive funding rate represents an upbeat market mood, a very high reading indicates that the leverage is heavily skewed on the bullish side and often paves the way for price pullbacks,” Godbole wrote.  Traders anticipate an ether ETF  Options traders are betting big on ether’s turn for an ETF, reported CoinDesk’s Muyao Shen.  Data reveals strong purchase activity on ether’s $15,000 call options (the right to buy the underlying asset in the future at a predetermined price) expiring March 25, 2022 – a far cry away from the current spot price around $4,000.  Altcoin roundup  Associated Press taps Chainlink for elections, sports data: The Associated Press (AP), the 175-year-old news agency, will provide economic, sports and elections data to Chainlink, a system that provides information feeds to blockchains and triggers digital contracts to carry out transactions. The partnership, announced Thursday, is another example of an iconic, mainstream brand embracing blockchain technology, while also showing Chainlink’s plans to expand the reach of decentralized finance (DeFi) into new areas.  Worldcoin, now valued at $1B, has grand plans to get you to gaze Into the orb: Worldcoin announced Thursday it raised $25 million from investors including Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Coinbase Ventures, Digital Currency Group (the parent company of CoinDesk) and angel investors, including crypto billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried and Reid Hoffman, the co-founder of LinkedIn. The company is currently valued at $1 billion. The Orbs are handled by independent entrepreneurs Worldcoin calls “Orb Operators,” who take the devices into the world – say remote villages and metro stations and university campuses – and convince people to sign up for free worldcoin with an eye scan. Orb uses the eyescan to create a unique identifier, called IrisHash, which ensures the signee is human and has not collected worldcoin before.  NFT artist Brian Frye wants you to steal his intellectual property: Brian Frye, a conceptual artist, film maker and law professor, encourages people to plagiarize everything he’s ever created or said, reports CoinDesk’s Daniel Kuhn. This pro-plagiarism stance is part of Frye’s continuing campaign against copyright, the legal instantiation of the idea that ideas can and should be owned. This contrarian opinion has brought him to the world of non-fungible tokens (NFT), the blockchain-based technology often credited with bringing “scarcity” to digital goods.

42375979,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwDJ8v,1634847643,Walmart Has Quietly Begun Hosting Bitcoin ATMs,"Walmart, the world’s largest company by revenue, is rolling out bitcoin ATMs at dozens of its U.S. stores.  Shoppers can purchase the cryptocurrency at Coinstar machines inside the retailer’s cavernous big box stores. A CoinDesk editor verified that the service works, buying a small amount of BTC at a Pennsylvania Walmart on Oct. 12.  “Coinstar, in partnership with Coinme, has launched a pilot that allows its customers to use cash to purchase bitcoin,” Walmart communications director Molly Blakeman told CoinDesk via email. “There are 200 Coinstar kiosks located inside Walmart stores across the United States that are part of this pilot.”  Coinstar is best known for allowing consumers to exchange coins for paper bills or gift cards. The ability to buy bitcoin is enabled by Coinme, a crypto wallet and payment firm that specializes in bitcoin ATMs (BTMs).  After inserting bills into the machine, a paper voucher is issued. The next stage involves setting up a Coinme account and passing a know-your-customer (KYC) check before the voucher can be redeemed. The machine charges a 4% fee for the bitcoin option, plus another 7% cash exchange fee, according to the Coinstar website and verified by CoinDesk.  CoinDesk tested the service out of an abundance of caution following a hoax last month, when a fake press release claimed that litecoin (LTC) would be accepted as payment at Walmart stores. This time, the bitcoin-Bentonville connection is real. A source with knowledge of the pilot said the Litecoin debacle had put Walmart, which is based in Bentonville, Ark., off from issuing a press release.  Bitcoin ATMs on the rise  The cryptocurrency ATM industry is expanding at a rapid pace, partly fueled by the COVID pandemic. Coinstar announced plans in 2020 to double its fleet of 3,500 Coinme BTMs amid a spike in usage.  More recently, Coinstar, which started adding bitcoin-buying services with Coinme in early 2019, added 300 bitcoin-enabled machines at Winn-Dixie, Fresco y Más, Harveys and other grocery stores across Florida.  But Walmart, long seen as the crown jewel to bringing crypto financial services into the mainstream, is another step up – even if the 200-kiosk bitcoin ATM pilot is chump change for a company with 4,700 stores and a market cap of $409 billion.  The potential for crypto-enabled financial services for lower-income users is alluringly close given shared connections among Walmart, Coinme and MoneyGram, but the retailer didn’t elaborate further on its crypto plans.  Bitcoin ATMs and Compliance Concerns  While large-scale BTM rollouts could bode well for adoption, there are concerns about money laundering, said Seth Sattler, compliance director of BTM provider DigitalMint.  That’s because some crypto ATM operators turn a blind eye to the relatively high level of illicit activity the machines attract, he said. That includes money mules, human traffickers and assorted scammers.  Over the past 18 months, DigitalMint, which accounts for only 5% of total BTM transaction volume, has rejected and returned $5 million to fraud victims, said Sattler, who is also a leading contributor to the recently convened Cryptocurrency Compliance Cooperative.  “Large retailers need to make sure they know the vendor they’re getting into bed with and what that organization is doing to manage risk,” Sattler said in an interview.

Here is a closer look at what went down, and what might have happened as a result.

Bitcoin All Exchanges Reserve Continues To Go Down As pointed out by a CryptoQuant post, the Bitcoin all exchanges reserve continues to show a downtrend despite the crypto making new all-time highs (ATHs). The all exchanges reserve is a BTC indicator that tells us the total amount of coins deposited on centralized exchange wallets. When the value of the metric shows an increase, it means investors are sending more of their Bitcoin to exchanges. This could imply that there is a selling pressure in the market as holders usually move their crypto to exchanges for withdrawing to fiat, or for purchasing altcoins with them. Decreases in the indicator, on the other hand, suggest the supply for BTC is shortening as investors are taking their coins off exchanges. Such a trend could mean there is a buying pressure in the market and may prove to be bullish for the price. Here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin all exchanges reserve indicator over the past couple of weeks: Bitcoin reserves seem to be trending downward | Source: CryptoQuant As you can see in the above graph, while the price of BTC has shot up recently as the crypto makes new ATHs, the indicator&apos;s value has sharply fallen down.

42421713,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXpDNV,1634837298,NFT Artist Brian Frye Wants You to Steal This Article,"Brian Frye, a conceptual artist, film maker and law professor, encourages people to plagiarize everything he’s ever created or said.  “I’m the legal academy’s leading plagiarism advocate. I’m also the legal academy’s only plagiarism advocate, which makes it very easy to be number one,” the bespectacled Frye said in a video call yesterday. Well, professor, I’m stealing that joke.  This article is part of CoinDesk’s Policy Week, a forum for discussing how regulators are reckoning with crypto (and vice versa). A version of it published first in The Node newsletter, which you can subscribe tohere.  This pro-plagiarism stance is part of Frye’s continuing campaign against copyright, the legal instantiation of the idea that ideas can and should be owned. Over the past decade and a half, Frye has written countless legal reviews and op-eds discussing how copyright is antiquated in a world where the internet eliminates the costs associated with reproduction and distribution.  “Ideas are non-rival,” he told CoinDesk. “You don’t need to value them because there’s no scarcity, so they should be valueless.”  This contrarian opinion has brought him to the world of non-fungible tokens (NFT), the blockchain-based technology often credited with bringing “scarcity” to digital goods. It’s an idea for which lots of people are willing to pay big bucks.  A representative example: Ether Rocks is a series of virtual pet rocks that “live” on the Ethereum blockchain. There are 100 unique tokens – each corresponding to a near-identical cartoon JPEG – that even the creators say serve “NO PURPOSE” beyond speculation. Though the original image was a royalty-free piece of clip art, some people have spent millions of dollars on these tokens.  But, as Frye notes, what people are buying when they buy any NFT is “worthless.” By and large, NFTs do not represent ownership of the digital goods to which they supposedly correspond, do not confer copyright and may, in fact, one day be classified as securities. “So the owner of the NFT gets nothing other than the right to claim ownership of the NFT,” he wrote in August.  That’s not nothing. In fact, Frye is learning NFTs have a lot going for them. For one, there’s a sort of community-wide acceptance that people can sell even things they don’t possess. He sold an NFT of the Brooklyn Bridge for $500 – stealing the idea from an infamous scam artist.  NFTs are the “reductio ad absurdum” of contemporary art markets, meaning they reduce the “concept of ownership to its purest essence, it’s the ownership of ownership,” he said, and of art to pure market functions. Art, he said, has always been more about status than anything, and the blockchain just makes this pecking order more visible and open.  Further, NFTs are a sort of blunt instrument to wield against legacy institutions. In September, Frye minted a series of NFTs tied to a paper he wrote called “SEC No-Action Letter Request,” which raised the question of whether selling shares of ownership in the paper is an illegal unregistered security.  There was the implicit promise of income, which, to his surprise, actually came through. He brought in tens of thousands of dollars worth of ETH in the sale. This proved his thesis: The project called into question standing securities law, which Frye thinks is overly broad in covering “any investment in a common enterprise that generates profit from the efforts of others,” and lays out a possible argument the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could use against him.  Read more: Some NFTs Are Probably Illegal. Does the SEC Care?  It’s easy to call everything meaningless: art, securities rules, copyright. As part of a series we’ve called “Gensler for a Day,” which is asking informed and influential people to give their ideal crypto policies, CoinDesk reached out to see if Frye has any concrete plans, not just concepts. It’s not too far out there: Frye did once run for public office.  What follows is a condensed version of our conversation, covering NFTs, the SEC and the merits of writing while taking a bath. You can read a full version on CoinDesk.com. And feel free to steal his ideas.  “Break a contemporary museum into pieces with the means you have chosen, collect the pieces and put them together again with glue.” [That’s a line from Yoko Ono’s poetry book “Grapefruit,” which Frye has cited as inspiration.] Does that mean anything to you?  The idea is to just give people something to think about when they think about what they’re doing and why they’re doing it, you know, and also to do it by kind of ostentatiously plagiarizing someone else at the same time. All my good ideas are stolen from someone else.  Is that what you’re doing with NFTs? I mean, I think so. I’m not sure what I’m doing in NFTs, yet. When the NFT thing first hit the public consciousness over the summer, somebody called me from Business Insider and wanted me to talk about what was going on. The first thing I said to her was, “I have no idea what’s happening, but I love it.” That’s still true, I have no idea what’s happening. I don’t think anyone has any idea what’s happening, but something is happening. I’m just trying to do my best to be open to whatever it is that’s taking place enough to help me see even though I can’t figure out what it is.  Are you purposefully goading the SEC to make a determination?  They won’t talk to me, they don’t want to talk to me, they’re terrified of what I’m asking them. This is existential for the SEC.  What do you mean by that?  OK, look, everyone asks the wrong question. People keep saying, “is it a security?” If the SEC wants to regulate it – that’s the only real question. The SEC transforms things into securities by the magic of regulation. Anything can be a security as long as the SEC decides to characterize it as a security because the definition is overinclusive, it means everything.  I don’t mean I’m agnostic as to how we should go about doing this. Maybe a probationary regime of securities regulation is what we want. Maybe we do want a kind of SEC exercising discretion about what it regulates. But the problem is the SEC. The people there are morons. They have no idea what they’re doing and they don’t actually realize that the term “security” is meaningless.  So this is a problem for them because all of a sudden they’re confronted with something that is terribly, existentially terrifying to them because they don’t know what to do with it.  You’re doing the work for them. They can plagiarize it if they want.  A friend of mine said to me when I did the SEC “No Action” letter requests as a work of conceptual art – the conceptual art consisted of me sending the “No Action” letter request to the SEC asking them to “regulate me baby.” I explained to them, this is a security according to your definition, therefore you should prohibit me from selling it. My friend said this is probably the first ever “Action” letter request. Because nobody sends a letter to the SEC, saying, “I want to do something illegal, please stop me.”  You’ve received broad acceptance from the NFT community, from the media – Business Insider, Bloomberg, CoinDesk. But it seems like your true audience – the SEC – has rejected your work. (They could also just move slowly.) How does that make you feel?  I love it. If the SEC had it in them to respond to what I’m doing I think it would make the art less fun. The whole point is to be trolling the government. The SEC is basically nerd cops. They want to be in the business of being in charge. The one thing you’re not used to is people punking them. No one does this.  Except for Elon Musk.  Fair. He’s got balls of steel to punk the SEC while having something actually on the line. No one questions whether or not it falls within the sphere of securities regulation. He’s playing chicken with them. In my case, there’s no risk. What are they going to do to me? It would be too humiliating for them to prosecute me. Bringing an action against me would be like throwing me in the briar patch.  You said that a lot of people suddenly wanted to spend a lot of money to buy nothing, because that’s what an NFT is – nothing. Are your ideas worth less than nothing?  I mean, ideas are valueless because they don’t need to have a value. Ideas are non-rival. You don’t need to value them because there’s no scarcity, so they should be valueless. What I find most interesting about NFTs is that they sort of are the reductio ad absurdum of the art world in a really beautiful way.  Everyone talks about Walter Benjamin and the “aura of authenticity of the work of art.” You know, God bless him, I think he was actually onto something, but he was totally wrong, but it wasn’t his fault that in 100 years there’d be the internet, let alone cryptocurrency or NFTs. The problem is he saw the aura as being attached to the authentic object; but what he missed, I think, was that the aura is really all about ownership. The concept of ownership. The peculiar thing about NFTs is that they reduce the concept of ownership to its purest essence, it’s the ownership of ownership, and that’s it.  Right. You don’t own the object, you own a token that may correspond to an object.  You own a token that the relevant people are willing to accept as corresponding to ownership of something valuable. Something that they care about, that matters, is meaningful. It’s all about status, really, it’s about other people’s recognition. When you buy art, what you’re buying is a spot in some artist’s catalog or resume – sometimes a dirty piece of cloth or a lumpy rock comes along with it.  See also: It’s Time to Talk About NFTs and Intellectual Property Law  You’re sometimes credited, but not always, with the idea that copyright holders are like landlords. Insisting that an idea has value and then charging a type of tithe for people to use it. Who fixes the drain when something is clogged in this analogy?  No one! That’s part of the problem. Corporate owners are the worst landlords because they don’t do any maintenance, and they think they’re God’s gift. Regular landlords at least have a bit of humility. The whole point is not to say that there’s anything wrong with landlords, it’s just to say that there is something wrong with idolizing copyright owners and authors by association with their ideas. There’s nothing special about collecting rent, and that’s all you’re doing when you assert copyright ownership.  Do you have thoughts about the idea of copyright in NFTs?  The beautiful thing about NFTs is that they might actually solve a problem, at least some of the problems, that arise in that landlord scenario. What we’ve done with this technology and various other kinds of internet-based platforms has eliminated entirely all the costs associated with reproducing and distributing works of authorship. That used to be the most expensive part of getting culture out to the public. The whole reason that copyright came into existence in the first place was that the cost of reproduction and distribution had come down slightly when the printing press was invented. When the cost came down a little bit – from manuscripts to printed books – copyright made sense.  The problem is that now the cost of reproduction and distribution is zero. It’s zero. The only cost is associated with producing the work in the first place, but we’re stuck with the same mechanism designed for a world where transaction costs associated with reproduction and distribution were significant.  My hope is that NFTs have the potential to actually compensate authors without having to have copyright at all. Imagine two different potential worlds: You can have one world where you own the right to control the use of the works of authorship you create – you can tell people what they can and can’t do with whatever it is that you produce. But you don’t really get any money if no one really cares or wants to give you money for it. In the other world you don’t own anything. You have no right to control how people use the work of authorship that you created, but somebody is willing to give you 100 grand for it. Which do you prefer?  I’m greedy. I want the money, upfront. I don’t give a [care] about control. We don’t need control anymore as long as you can get paid up front. And, to my mind, NFTs might make that possible. A lot of people are still stuck in this controlling mindset.  What are the concrete policy considerations you want to throw on the table? Eliminate copyright?  I think it has to happen on its own. I’m not delusional enough to think anyone gives a [hoot] what I think. All I can do is throw ideas out there and see what sticks. The landlord thing was great: I put it out there, Mike Masnick picked it up, people ran with it, nobody attributes it to me, but they use it all the time and I love it. It was viral. No one’s going to listen to me to make copyright policy or any other kind of policy, but if we can shift the window a little bit and help people see that this is something actually positive and potentially liberatory that’s going to give people an opportunity to get outside of our regime of ownership that is not productive.  So plagiarism is productive?  I think creators are very narcissistic and they should get over themselves. I like to say I’m the legal academy’s leading plagiarism advocate. I’m also the legal academy’s only plagiarism advocate, which makes it very easy to be number one.  Why do you write in a bathtub?  It’s comfortable. It’s relaxing. It gives me a little bit of time off. Alan Greenspan used to do it.  A little Randian in the tub.  I like to think he would be horrified by everything I stand for.  Do you still think NFTs have the ability to collapse the traditional art market by siphoning off capital?  I think yes. I mean, ideally, yes. But I would put it a little bit differently. I think NFTs have the potential to make the traditional art market irrelevant, which will be a wonderful thing because I think that there’s a fetishization of objects that I think is unhealthy. Taking the money away lets us think about the art more. Art is a consumer good that consumers don’t understand. Consumers understand money – that’s why we talk about art in terms of money, because that helps people understand it. We talk about law schools in the same way, in rankings. We have stock markets – someone won a Nobel Prize for telling us that price is just a way of communicating information.  [Laughs, Googles Joseph E. Stiglitz, cries.]  The art market is a way of communicating information about consumer preferences. The problem is consumers don’t actually know what they want to buy. All they know is what the price tells them about what they’re supposed to buy. What they’re ultimately buying isn’t the object, it’s the status associated with the object. NFTs make the work available to everyone on the same terms, and make it very clear that what you’re buying and what you’re trading is just the status associated with being the owner.  See also: Nobel Laureate Thinks Bitcoin is an “Amazing” Bubble  Some notable art critics have said there’s little aesthetic value in NFT art.  Most art critics are idiots. I’m in the process of trolling Chris Knight right now – the least-deserving Pulitzer Prize winner in the history of Pulitzer Prizes. I will concede that what people are trading is in many respects not to my aesthetic preferences. But I don’t think that matters. Who cares what my aesthetic preferences are? If people like it, who’s to say?  I also think that it’s too early to really know what people are going to ultimately value and find worthwhile, and why they’re going to value it and find it worthwhile. The wonderful thing about NFTs is we don’t actually need them – they’re a technical solution to a problem that never actually existed, but we need to figure out how to solve anyway.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/10/21/nft-artist-brian-frye-wants-you-to-steal-this-article,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9da2fd9867a63c72740704d8ca5cbf67ed9a5ce3-1600x1236.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42375975,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwDJ3t,1634836949,Bitcoin Tumbles to $63K in Quick Retreat From All-Time High,"Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, suffered its biggest price pullback in almost a month in a sharp retreat just a day after reaching a new all-time high price near $67,000.  The bitcoin price skidded 6% over the past 24 hours in digital-asset markets and was changing hands around $63,000 as of 17:07 UTC (1:07 p.m. ET) on Thursday.  The record high on Wednesday came as the ProShares futures-focused Bitcoin Strategy Exchange-Traded Fund (NYSE: BITO) started trading on the New York Stock Exchange this week. That launch brought in $570 million of assets and garnered $1 billion of trading volume during its first day, one of the most successful ETF launches of all time.  To some market commentators, Thursday’s price drop looked more like a short-term retreat than the beginning of a prolonged slide. Earlier this week, analysts told CoinDesk they saw bullish indicators in price charts, touting predictions of $80,000, $86,000, even $100,000.  “Long-term holders do not appear to be selling just yet, so this is likely just a short-term pullback,” said Lucas Outumuro, head of research at IntoTheBlock.  After four days of a solid rally, it’s time for a reset before the next ascent, according to Laurent Kssis, director of CEC Capital.  “The market remains bullish overall,” he said.  Kay Khemani, managing director at Spectre.ai, says this volatility is perfectly normal in any asset that has rallied significantly over many weeks to break new all-time highs. He sees the next psychological resistance level at the $70,000 mark.  “Trepidation is bound to set in as investors and traders alike seek to lock in their gains ahead of possible limit orders set at the $70K mark,” said Khemani.  With the launch of more bitcoin futures exchange-traded funds on the horizon, there’s speculation that a warm reception might provide a positive catalyst.  VanEck revealed it had secured approval to launch its bitcoin futures-linked ETF in a post-effective filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Wednesday, which could have a similar effect on market sentiment as ProShares’ initial launch. Valkyrie Investments’ bitcoin futures ETF has won the blessing of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and is set to start trading on Friday, under the ticker BTF on the Nasdaq. The crypto-native fund manager is the third sponsor of bitcoin futures ETFs to clear all regulatory hurdles.  “When another ETF is announced, bitcoin will continue this upward movement and momentum,” said Matt Case, analyst at Quantum Economics.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/10/21/bitcoin-tumbles-to-63k-in-quick-retreat-from-all-time-high,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cd854fd4001706894730f1f23a1c7c13a615dd66-1440x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42421717,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXpDQb,1634836901,In Defense of OCC Nominee Saule Omarova,"There are many types of financial innovation. Some (ATM withdrawals) are more trustworthy than others (subprime mortgage-backed bonds). Yet, too often, in fintech and crypto circles, technological stability is mistaken for financial stability. Companies demand we trust but not verify. The first corporations to use telephones and index cards, personal computers and spreadsheets, and electronic recording systems for finance also argued we should suspend skepticism of these products due to the new tech involved. They were all wrong to do so.  Stability flows not only from technology but from law and regulation. When we scratch the surface of the loose mix of companies labeled “fintech” or “crypto,” we often find old ideas. On the other hand, there are genuinely novel developments, mostly centered around data collection and governance. We need regulators who can distinguish between the old and new forms of finance if we are to have democratic accountability.  This post is part of CoinDesk’s “Policy Week,” a forum for discussing how regulators are reckoning with crypto (and vice versa). Raúl Carrillo is an Associate Research Scholar at Yale Law School.  So, it is shocking to see the attacks on Prof. Saule Omarova, President Joe Biden’s pick to head the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). Whether it’s libertarian magazines jumping to conclusions about a single phrase in a single paper (on an issue outside of the OCC’s ambit) or longtime crypto activists engaging in red-baiting, many people skeptical of concentrated power have ironically toed the bankers’ line against Omarova.  Now, Omarova has recognized the power of financial innovation to improve the quality of our lives. She acknowledges the U.S. lacks a unified strategy for fintech regulation and does not profess to have all the answers. She argues our payment and banking systems need to be more inclusive of low-income households and marginalized communities, goals the new industries say they respect. She has even emphasized the importance of data security and privacy, and deftly highlighted that opinions on these matters are not uniform among innovators.  Omarova takes a serious, long-term, big-picture attitude toward the entire financial system in favor of regulatory principles rather than any single industry’s agenda. She has long been a vocal critic of traditional finance and the largest, most entrenched players within it. And, she has argued the public interest is not served by allowing Facebook to issue its own money or Rakuten, the “Amazon of Japan,” to own a bank.  Indeed, to the astute observer, recent opposition to Omarova’s nomination from multiple corners of the fintech world exposes a sad reality: Many of the biggest players have the same anti-competitive aspirations as JPMorgan Chase or Google.  Omarova is in sync with most existing regulators, not outside the mainstream. From a financial stability perspective, her skepticism about “private money” is entirely justified. Today’s stablecoins can be seen as part of a longer history of companies offering financial instruments to the public, claiming they can be redeemed at a stable, nominal redemption value, while also evading consumer protections, federal deposit insurance and broader banking regulations. The history of wildcat banking and, more recently, money market funds, shows this design is at the root of shadow banking crises. No technological arrangement mitigates these concerns.  Consumers and investors deserve protections regardless of the tech involved. As Andrew Park, a senior policy analyst for Americans for Financial Reform, observed after crypto users lost $90 million due to a company error, “There are reasons to criticize the existing banking system, but there are a lot of safeguards in place to prevent these kinds of things from happening.”  At the federal level, companies offering deposits are regulated by the OCC, yes, but also by the Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and a host of supporting agencies. Companies offering investment products are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which can coordinate jurisdiction with respect to new products. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau patrols the user interface beyond investments.  Companies attempting to engage with customers in good faith, according to reasonable expectations, given laws on the books, have nothing to fear. There are clearly bright lines: For instance, as an advocate of financial inclusion and an anti-monopolist, Omarova is mindful that approaching fintech and techfin companies (or any powerful player) with a too-light touch, without considering the effects on institutions like community banks, would be irresponsible.  Omarova’s scholarship does not suggest she’d take a blunt approach. If fintech and crypto firms truly want to beat big banks at the game of serving retail investors and consumers, then they’ll have an ally in Omarova, whose work emphasizes the role of fair competition. If companies want to find new ways to avoid accountability to the people buying their products – as the dinosaur institutions have long done – history has many labels to describe them. “Innovators” is not one. “Fraudsters” comes close.

Several years in the making, the global anti-money laundering (AML) watchdog issued draft guidance for virtual asset service providers (VASPs) at a plenary meeting in March, but the final revised guidance was delayed as the regulatory agency attempted to encompass fast-moving areas of innovation such as decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).  As well as further clarification on the definition of VASPs, the guidance explains how FATF standards apply to stablecoins, Pleyer said. He also mentioned FATF’s expectation that countries will implement standards for the so-called “Travel Rule” for cryptocurrency transactions “as soon as possible.”  The revised guidance should also include a broadening of what is considered a VASP in DeFi as well as the FATF’s take on NFTs, according to Siân Jones, senior partner at XReg Consulting.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has ordered information about the payments products, plans and practices of Google, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Square and PayPal.  Of the six companies, Facebook, Square and PayPal’s payment services have all ventured into the crypto industry.  The CFPB has been taxed by Congress with ensuring competition is fair in payments markets, given the immense scale of this group of companies and therefore their ability to monetize data on customer spending habits.  “That many Big Tech companies aspire to grow in [the payments] space only heightens these concerns,” the CFPB said in a statement Thursday.  “Will the operators engage in invasive financial surveillance and combine the data they collect on consumers with their geolocation and browsing data? Will they in turn use this data to deepen behavioral advertising, engage in price discrimination, or sell to third parties?” the CFPB listed among its key concerns.  In response, the trade body for the payments industry, the Electronic Transactions Association (ETA), stated its commitment to protecting consumer data and digital transactions.  “The digital transactions industry has a good story to tell about its efforts to protect consumer data,” Jodie Kelley, CEO of the ETA said. “One of the hallmarks of the digital transactions industry is protection of consumer data.

42375980,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwDJAB,1634828450,"Worldcoin, Now Valued at $1B, Has Grand Plans to Get You to Gaze Into the Orb","Would you let a chrome, volleyball-sized sphere scan your retinas in exchange for crypto?  That’s the interesting – and controversial – premise behind Worldcoin, a new project co-founded by former Y Combinator President Sam Altman.  Depending on whom you ask, Worldcoin’s plan might sound futuristic and cool, a little silly, or like a dystopian nightmare ripped from science fiction. When news of the project leaked to Bloomberg in June, the media response was critical.  Silicon Valley, however, is excited about the project.  Worldcoin announced Thursday it raised $25 million from investors including Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Coinbase Ventures, Digital Currency Group (the parent company of CoinDesk) and angel investors including crypto billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried and Reid Hoffman, the co-founder of LinkedIn. The company is currently valued at $1 billion.  According to some of the company’s prediction models, Worldcoin thinks over a billion people will have gazed into the Orb by 2023.  ‘Orb Operators’  Worldcoin, which is based in Berlin, Germany, currently has about 70 employees and about 30 Orbs.  The Orbs are handled by independent entrepreneurs Worldcoin calls “Orb Operators’ who take the devices into the world – into remote villages and metro stations and university campuses – and convince people to sign up for free worldcoin with an eye scan, which the Orb uses to create a unique identifier called IrisHash that ensures the person is a human who has not collected worldcoin before.  Though privacy experts have expressed concern over this plan, Alex Blania, one of the co-founders of Worldcoin, believes that the Orb’s design is privacy-preserving. According to Blania, the photos of user retinas are not stored anywhere, and zero-knowledge proofs are used to keep user information private and secure. Blania also told CoinDesk that users’ names and other identifying information is never collected.  Beginning in November, Worldcoin plans to ramp up production to an astonishing 4,000 Orbs per month, which the company plans to match with Orb Operators across the world.  Blania told CoinDesk that Worldcoin has partnered with a “very big international manufacturer” with a plant in Germany, which will pump out about 50,000 Orbs per year. Though Blania declined to name the company or say where the company was from, when CoinDesk asked if the manufacturer was Chinese, Blania responded:  “Definitely not, for many reasons, and one of them is actually security. The Orb itself has private keys and signs every message it sends so we know it’s actually a real Orb. And that means we need to lock this whole supply chain totally up so we know it’s not compromised,” Blania said.  Grand plans  According to Worldcoin, 130,000 people around the world have already gazed into the Orb in a crypto twist on universal basic income (UBI).  Blania told CoinDesk the amount each person receives depends on how early in the project’s roll-out they got involved, with the amount diminishing as more people are onboarded, but that the amount is roughly valued at between $10 and $200. This amount is doled out over two years, with 10% available immediately in a wallet app generated by the Orb.  Worldcoin, which is built as a layer 2 system that works on the Ethereum network, has a cap of 10 billion worldcoins. Blania told CoinDesk that 8 billion of those will be distributed globally – the company’s stated goal is to give worldcoin to “every human on earth” – while 2 billion worldcoin will be reserved for the soon-to-be-set-up Worldcoin Foundation and for investors.  The Orb was designed by Swedish industrial designer Thomas Meyerhoffer, who previously designed for Apple and Porsche.  “It’s the first contact for users, right? So we just wanted to make it really, really cool and really exciting,” Blania said. “And by making it shiny it gets people’s attention and they see their reflection as they stand there … it’s a very cool and memorable [experience].”  Blania also said that rapper Azaelia Banks, who was rumored to be a representative of Worldcoin after the June leaks, is not and has never been affiliated with Worldcoin.

Other participating investors included Connect Ventures, an investment firm formed by Creative Artists Agency and venture capital firm New Enterprise Associates, Moore Strategic Ventures plus CMT Digital and Sfermion.  Mojito is now out of stealth mode, with Sotheby’s most recently announcing its new platform, called Sotheby’s Metaverse, is powered by Mojito. The system allows visitors to view digital artworks available at auction, as well as learn about the collectors and artists behind NFTs.  Mojito co-founder Amanda Cassatt, the former chief marketing officer at ConsenSys, told CoinDesk the company is spinning out of Serotonin, the marketing firm she manages.  “NFT commerce suite and what that means is that we’ve built, or are building, all of the tools and products that a brand or a right holder needs end to end in order to sell NFTs. So Mojito is the underlying technology to power Sotheby’s Metaverse,” Cassatt said.  The $20 million investment will go toward expanding the Mojito team on the engineering and product side and building the tools and services that allow brands and rights holders to access the technology.  NFTs are digital assets that represent a wide range of items, from collectible sports cards to virtual real estate and even digital sneakers. The metaverse is a digital environment generated by the convergence of virtual worlds, augmented reality and internet services.

The partnership, announced Thursday, is another example of an iconic, mainstream brand embracing blockchain technology, while also showing Chainlink’s plans to expand the reach of decentralized finance (DeFi) into new areas.  “Our view is that the blockchain is an entirely new economy,” Dwayne Desaulniers, AP’s director of blockchain and data licensing, told CoinDesk in an interview. “And as a new economy, it just needs a lot of inputs, a lot of trust and a lot of collaboration. What we see now is adoption just going berserk, and blockchain being adopted in half the time that the internet took to get to like a billion users.”  The AP’s choice to provide data to various blockchains through Chainlink signifies both a shift in how data sources value smart contracts and a significant increase in what smart contracts are now able to achieve using AP data, said Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov.  “As we’ve seen with the rise of DeFi, the rate at which Chainlink oracles can bring new data onto blockchains is the rate at which blockchain developers can build interesting new applications for users,” Nazarov said in an email. “With AP providing their signed data about elections, sports and various key world events, DeFi markets across the blockchain ecosystem can now be made about a wide array of previously inaccessible topics.”  AP goes DeFi  AP previously teamed up with Chainlink for the U.S. elections last November, when the news agency published a “race call” on the results to the Ethereum blockchain. On top of that, AP has been an enthusiastic champion of the exploding non-fungible token (NFT) realm, having sold the first media NFT in early 2021.  As well as adding race call data on the 2021 U.S. gubernatorial and state legislative elections to its newly launched Chainlink oracle node, AP will begin providing a new range of economic and sports-related information. The macro economic and sports datasets will hopefully start being added this year in the weeks following the elections, said Desaulniers.  “We will be bringing on-chain things like the GDP [gross domestic product] number, the unemployment rate, the CPI [consumer price index] number and other bits of trusted data from AP that we will publish to our node so developers will be able to access that,” Desaulniers said. “Sports is another area; not just scores, but also fast-breaking player reports, transactions, injuries.”  AP, which operates as a not-for-profit collective owned by its member newspapers and broadcasters, has evolved through the disruption of online publishing by diversifying its revenue streams. On-chain data is yet another green pasture to be discovered, Desaulniers said.  “Absolutely, we’re looking to monetize the data that we put on-chain,” he said. “But you know, how much and what’s the value? It’s very early, and these are things still to be discovered. And that’s fine with us.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | LINK | MARKET,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/10/21/associated-press-taps-chainlink-for-elections-sports-data,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8ae79544e0a286adc7a9e9f1ef4ac8a3c9f246ed-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The average number of weekly DEX traders is more than 200,000, and approximately 40% of them are facing problems with multi-step transactions. Swapping an ERC-20 token for a BEP-20 token requires the following steps: A token swap on an Ethereum DEX to a bridge-compatible token; Then a swap across the bridge; Then an additional swap on a BSC-based DEX, to get to your targeted BEP-20 token.

The industry’s total market cap has more than tripled since the beginning of this year, when it stood at $770 billion.

The fast growth has also raised alarms among regulators, worried that stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies could present risks to the stability of the traditional financial system.

The bridge market, however, is largely dominated by centralized solutions or a handful of decentralized incumbents – a state of affairs one startup is looking to disrupt.  Symbiosis Finance, a stablecoin-based cross-chain bridge, announced the close of its $2 million funding round on Thursday. Blockchain.com Ventures led the round with participation from Wave Financial, BTC Inc, KuCoin Labs, Injective Labs, DAO Maker, Primitive Ventures, Kairon Labs, Gate.io and Richard Dai.  Symbiosis Chief Marketing Officer Nick Avramov said the team currently has testnet coverage for a number of networks, and is aiming to incorporate more before mainnet launch.  “Right now we have five networks – Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Avalanche and [Huobi’s] HECO,” he said. “We’re going to cover every layer 2, and even some layer 1s like Solana – we just built a proof-of-concept for the Solana hackathon.”  Mix ‘n’ match  The team demonstrated for CoinDesk a testnet swap between UNI on Ethereum’s Rinkeby network to CAKE on BSC’s testnet, a swap that routed the UNI to stablecoins, stablecoins between the networks and finally exchanged the stablecoins for CAKE.  The asset swaps were conducted using an order router between multiple exchanges and assets, similar to exchange aggregators like 1inch. The team launched a full testnet version of the product on Oct. 20.  Read more: Interoperability Startup LayerZero Comes Out of Stealth With $6M in Funding  Avramov argued that this architecture is superior to bridge products that use a native token for cross-chain liquidity, noting that on native-token bridges users then need to establish an individual liquidity pool for each swappable asset, and that native tokens can be highly volatile.  The cross-chain network of validators and stablecoin liquidity providers will use native SMB tokens and a staking/slashing scheme for security, said Avramov. Validators will collect swap and bridging fees, as well as rewards in SMB in a forthcoming liquidity mining scheme.  Currently the validator computation and contract is hosted on Ethereum, but it will eventually migrate to Solana.

42421718,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXpDSf,1634820600,How Does Crypto Fit Into a Passive Investment Strategy?,"Until recently, there has been little that’s passive about cryptocurrency. From the get-go, buying bitcoin or alternative coins (altcoins) requires research – at least enough to open a digital wallet or app that lets your clients buy cryptocurrency, such as Robinhood, CashApp or Venmo.  Then there’s the market news, which changes every day. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has made significant strides in the conversation about regulating the $2 trillion asset class – including approving a bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund (ETF) to begin trading this week.  This article originally appeared in Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s new weekly newsletter defining crypto, digital assets and the future of finance. Sign up here to receive it every Thursday.  But still, a futures-based ETF differs from a physically backed ETF and will likely benefit traders more than passive investors, Matt Hougan of Bitwise told CoinDesk’s Emily Parker last week. According to Hougan, the futures-based bitcoin ETF is part of the SEC’s “crawl, walk, run” approach to opening up the growing crypto market to everyday investors.  Access and value  Self-directed retail investors are able to access crypto easily, Hougan said, and have been for the past eight years. But advisors aren’t yet allocating their clients’ portfolios to the currency because there’s not yet a regulatory structure that lets them do so easily. It will be a while, it seems, before many advisors recommend crypto as anything more than a speculative investment.  “Unlike a dollar, the value of bitcoin [or crypto] can vary greatly on a day-to-day basis,” says Nashville-based certified financial planner Jeanne Fisher. This volatility is enough to make financial planners and advisors keep the blinders on and stick to the basic investment recommendations of Roth IRAs, no-fuss index funds and low-cost ETFs.  Yet, as Texas-based certified financial planner Morgen Rochard pointed out in an issue of the Crypto for Advisors newsletter last month, bitcoin has the highest risk-adjusted returns according to the Sharpe ratio.  The built-in scarcity of bitcoin in particular – along with its verifiability, portability, and durability – makes it one of the most historically deflationary types of currencies we’ve seen, argued Rochard. Unlike putting cash into a typical savings account, or even a high-yield account that earns clients 1% to 2%, storing cash as crypto is arguably easier and more potentially lucrative.  So is crypto a passive investment?  Crypto is therefore seen as an investment. But is it a passive one? Most financial planners say no, citing impossible-to-predict liquidity and growth. Even though bitcoin reached a new all-time high this week during the optimistic futures ETF buzz, some planners are giving it time to see if its value will continue climbing amid all the inevitable changes ahead.  Sentiment can do more than make investors weary: It can also influence markets, points out Lazetta Rainey Braxton, a New York-based certified financial planner and co-founder.  “When China said no to crypto, all of [the crypto values] tanked,” Braxton says, referring to the country’s recent crypto crackdown.  Therefore, Braxton recommends to her clients to cover all of the basics before getting into crypto: having a robust emergency fund, a retirement account such as a 401(k) or IRA (or both), and a passive brokerage account comprising index funds and ETFs.  Clients’ crypto money can then be their “play money,” says Braxton, who recommends to her clients they max out their crypto investments at only 5% of their portfolios.  While Braxton’s advice is common among financial planners, who understandably must protect their clients’ money and mitigate risk, it also helps to zoom out and help your clients understand the unique value they personally see in owning and/or using cryptocurrency.  Conceptualizing crypto for clients  Earlier this month, Adam Blumberg, a certified financial planner and founder of the cryptocurrency education company Interaxis, outlined three ways you can conceptualize an investment in bitcoin in particular for clients: As an economic revolution, as a macro investment (a way large funds and governments can protect value amid global economic influences), and as a micro investment – meaning, for the average person.  Identifying these areas will help your clients begin to see where they fit into the global picture and decide whether to wait for more passive crypto investing options coming one day, or to tighten up their financial foundation and prepare to take part now.  And if your clients are ready to begin using bitcoin and/or other cryptocurrencies to diversify their portfolios today, be sure to understand the 10 things every beginner crypto investor should know.",NEUTRAL,없음,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,Megan DeMatteo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/10/21/how-does-crypto-fit-into-a-passive-investment-strategy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/444bed59078ef60f8c16781624788c89a37b379f-4288x2686.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42421720,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXpDUj,1634820600,Bitcoin Futures ETFs Are Here. Is a Physical ETF Soon to Follow?,"For many advisors, allocating to bitcoin for their clients is a difficult thing to do. Advisors are faced with a difficult decision: They can use something like the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to gain exposure, or they can help their clients set up a bitcoin/crypto account that is not under their management.  Outside of these two options, there really aren’t many other solutions that are easily accessible for advisors. This problem has caused quite a few debates in the advisory world – one that could quite easily be solved with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).  This article originally appeared in Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s new weekly newsletter defining crypto, digital assets and the future of finance. Sign up here to receive it every Thursday.  The first bitcoin ETF filing was made in 2013, and was quickly denied by the SEC. The last formal bitcoin ETF denial happened in 2018. There is now quite a list of bitcoin ETF applications waiting to be approved or rejected by the SEC. Most of them are “physical” bitcoin ETFs – funds that will hold actual BTC.  Interestingly, there are several bitcoin futures-based ETFs waiting to be approved, with the first-ever ETF approval being the ProShares Bitcoin Futures fund (BITO), which began trading this week. Another notable application is Cathie Wood’s Ark Investments’ (ARKA) futures-based ETF.  Beginning in the first part of 2021, with Gary Gensler now the chairman of the SEC, we’ve seen multiple bitcoin ETF filings. According to Nate Geraci, the host of the “ETF Prime” podcast and president of the ETF Store, a registered investment advisor, this was due to the fact that Gensler has been seen as being historically pro-crypto, having taught blockchain courses at MIT.  Futures-based ETF vs. ‘physical’ ETF  As of Oct. 19, the SEC approved a futures-based ETF and the first fund (BITO, by ProShares) began trading. The fund had an astounding nearly $1 billion of volume in the first day of trading. To put this in perspective, this is the highest first-day organic volume seen in ETF history.  Bitcoin futures held by a fund create interesting problems, however. For example, if the bitcoin futures curve is in “contango” (the out-months are trading at a higher price than the front-months), this is equivalent to selling low and buying high. When futures are held in an ETF, they must be rolled at the end of each month. This creates what is called a negative roll yield – creating a decay in terms of return.  What this really boils down to is that a futures-based ETF will have a difficult time tracking the spot bitcoin price, and it will be an expensive way for advisors to allocate to bitcoin for their clients. But it might be the easiest option for quite a while.  “One of the main benefits of a futures-based ETF is that the futures are cash settled. There’s no custody. So, if the SEC has any issues around custody with bitcoin itself, that won’t be a concern with a futures-based bitcoin ETF,” according to Nate Geraci.  A “physical” ETF, however, does not have the same problems as a futures-based solution. While crypto trading, custody and reporting is more expensive than traditional finance, a physical bitcoin ETF will not have the same drag as a futures-based ETF. We can certainly expect a physical bitcoin ETF to be more expensive than most ETFs on the market, but likely cheaper than a futures-based ETF.  We can also expect a physical bitcoin ETF to track the spot bitcoin price more accurately than a futures-based ETF. Companies like Grayscale, which currently offers the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), have filed to convert to the ETF structure. [Editor’s note: Grayscale is owned by Digital Currency Group, the parent company of CoinDesk.] GBTC currently trades at a -20% discount to the spot bitcoin price, a phenomenon that many ETF experts believe will go to 0% upon ETF conversion.  Nate Geraci, for example, believes that we will not see a physical bitcoin ETF approved until the second half of 2022 at the earliest – and I agree with him. This is unfortunate because there is obviously demand for a physical bitcoin ETF.  Other means of crypto exposure  Advisors might wonder what other solutions exist for achieving bitcoin exposure for their clients. There are a few firms that offer separately managed bitcoin and crypto accounts (SMAs), but implementing these strategies is not as simple or elegant as simply buying an ETF.  One major advantage that SMAs have over ETFs is the fact they are able to trade actual bitcoin and potentially earn yield on the position. They are also much nimbler and won’t be limited to one cryptocurrency. As a bitcoin investor since 2012, I personally believe direct ownership is the best way to purchase bitcoin (although often not the most convenient).  The bitcoin ETF marketplace is quickly evolving. Advisors will shortly have the ability to allocate to bitcoin for their clients in multiple different ways: helping clients set up crypto accounts with crypto exchanges, a futures-based ETF, or even an SMA. Advisors are responsible for determining and researching the best way to achieve this allocation. Fortunately, it seems that the number of opportunities to do so is quickly increasing.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TRADING,Jackson Wood,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/10/21/bitcoin-futures-etfs-are-here-is-a-physical-etf-soon-to-follow,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/83fa0aa96c502a984150fe54f44bf22020032e7a-5081x3387.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Ivascyn told CNBC on Wednesday that some of the fixed-income firm’s hedge-fund portfolios are already trading crypto-linked securities, which he described as a “starting point.”  “We’re trading from a relative value perspective. So we’re not taking directional exposure, but we’re looking to take advantage of mispricings between the cash product, popular trust that trades on the exchange, and then the futures.”  Ivascyn said Pimco is exploring potentially trading crypto, but stressed that it will be taking “baby steps” and focusing heavily on internal diligence.  He went on to say that Pimco is “thinking about scenarios where this could take us to ensure that we are competitively prepared to deal with what’s a rapidly changing environment that offers a pretty significant value proposition.”  His comments come in a week that has seen the first bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange – a development some observers expect to accelerate the flow of institutional money into crypto.

The cryptocurrency bounced to $66,400, having found bids near $64,000 during the Asian hours.  Analysts foresee a rally toward $86,000 in the coming weeks. However, it may not be a smooth ride, as the derivatives market is beginning to show signs of overheating – often a recipe for price pullbacks.  Bitcoin’s average funding rate or the cost of holding long positions in the perpetual futures listed on major exchanges, including Binance, has risen to 0.06% – the highest in at least six months, according to data provided by Bybit. Exchanges calculate funding rates every eight hours.  On retail-focused exchange Bybit, the funding rate surged as high as 0.14% early today.  “Participants need to pay close attention to the exchange funding rates represented by Bybit, where retail investors are more concentrated, and excessive rates may trigger another short-term price downturn,” Babel Finance mentioned in the weekly research note published Monday.  While funding rates seen at press time are significantly higher than those seen before the early September sell-off and the mid-May price crash, they are not yet as high as the ones seen during the first quarter bull frenzy.  Although a positive funding rate represents an upbeat market mood, a very high reading indicates that the leverage is heavily skewed on the bullish side and often paves the way for price pullbacks.  Stack Funds COO and co-founder Matthew Dibb said elevated funding rates might inject volatility into the market. “Our expectation is that capital will rotate into ethereum and major altcoins while bitcoin cools off slightly,” Dibb added.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/10/21/bitcoin-holds-above-66k-but-elevated-funding-rates-call-for-caution,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c7b4d886c895df3a513172e33f778c7cc57f4db9-1400x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42412102,KEYN3b06rsSCg2kKkMI45z,1634779766,Australian Senate Committee Calls for New Rules for Crypto,"An Australian Senate committee has recommended a set of new rules to establish a clear framework for the country’s digital assets sector.  The committee on “Australia as a Technology and Financial Centre,” which submitted its initial report on the topic last November and a second in April this year, presented its third and final report Tuesday. The document outlines problems identified by leading industry participants and includes 12 recommendations to address the lack of crypto and blockchain regulations in the country.  Cryptocurrency and blockchain technology regulation in Australia has often appeared fragmented and haphazard with decades-old laws covering the new technology.  One witness told the committee that taxing profits on crypto transactions as a capital gain “unavoidably complicates” the establishment of crypto projects, compared with jurisdictions like Singapore that have “favorable income tax laws and do not have CGT (capital gains tax).”  Sen. Andrew Bragg, the committee’s chairman, said Australia can be competitive in crypto.  “Australia can be a leader in digital assets,” he said. “This means Australians can access new choices and lower prices. It means Australians can have more control of their financial destiny rather than being dependent on endless intermediation.”  Recommendations but not yet law  The committee recommended implementing a new licensing regime for crypto exchanges and establishing a custody or depository regulatory framework for digital assets.  The committee also recommended that the Australian government set up rules for companies that have the new decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) structure.  “AML/CTF regulations and Financial Action Task Force guidelines need to strike a balance between appropriately managing risks, without implementing the travel rule in a way that undermines the operation of legitimate digital asset businesses,” the committee said in its report in relation to DAOs, referring to anti-money-laundering (AML) rules and countering terrorism financing (CFT). The travel rule refers to a requirement that virtual asset service providers such as crypto exchanges disclose information about their customers. The rule was established by the global Financial Action Task Force.  The committee also addressed the issue of “debanking,” or banks refusing their services to local crypto and remittance customers. Last month, the committee heard several complaints about that.  The committee is recommending the country’s Treasury lead a “policy review” of the viability of a retail central bank digital currency in the country in order to curb reliance on the private banking sector.  The recommendations now go to the Senate, where they will be debated until it drafts a bill. The Senate and the House of Representatives would then vote on the bill.
