42428344,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL7Gth,1514070028,After the Futures: The Next Chapter for Bitcoin,"Charles Hayter is a former equities analyst at Citi and the CEO and co-founder at CryptoCompare.com, an informational resource for the world of cryptocurrencies.  The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review series.      On the ninth anniversary of Satoshi Nakamoto's white paper, one of the world's most respected derivatives providers, the CME Group, announced it would launch a regulated bitcoin futures market.  Not to be understated, this was a pivotal moment in bitcoin's history, and quite simply, the future has never been brighter.  It's safe to say that 2017 has been a remarkable year. Almost every single metric of adoption has shown signs of exponential growth: exchange users, wallet downloads, social media chatter, Google search trends, trading volumes, transactions per day, etc.  The price has moved hand-in-hand with these metrics, and bitcoin has reached more people than ever before.  Yet, many of the existing trading platforms have been struggling to stay online 24/7. (Even the CBOE website went down as it launched its bitcoin futures market.) In the majority of cases, these outages are not due to denial-of-service (DDOS) attacks, but the sheer volume of organic traffic.  And with this interest, the futures markets are effectively embedding bitcoin into the traditional regulated markets, adding legitimacy for those that doubted its longevity or who still believe it is a fraud (See: Jamie Dimon). Nevertheless, some bitcoin advocates take issue with the seal of approval from Wall Street.  Author Andreas Antonopoulos has said:  ""I am uniquely allergic to the word 'legitimacy,' it makes me want to vomit when warmongering, war profiteering bankers use it to describe bitcoin. That takes a lot of audacity.""  And it does seem there's reason to suggest Wall Street isn't directly behind this year's growth.  On March 10th, the Bats BZX exchange had its bitcoin ETF application denied by the SEC due to the unregulated and illiquid nature of bitcoin markets. The decision marked the end of a three-year journey for investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, who had long sought to bring such a product to market.  Bitcoin has faced many regulatory challenges in its history, most at the hands of regulators: the LedgerX ETF denial, Chinese regulators halting zero-fee trading and ultimately closing all exchanges.  However, the market capitalization of bitcoin has risen from $20 billion to well over $300 billion in the nine months since those developments.  Fueling the fire  That's not to say that Wall Street isn't bringing new interest to the market – far from it.  The futures markets have shown that investors want to gain exposure to bitcoin in a regulated manner without having to store the underlying asset. For the average investor, there's a lot of risk is involved with holding bitcoin and this is represented by the significant premiums.  But, aside from the pushing up the price and generating media coverage, the futures market will have profound effects on bitcoin.  Increasing demand will likely lead to more futures markets and creating greater volumes over time. There are currently over 15 applications pending for new ETFs, the volume is coming and to quote Antonopoulos again, there is a long way to go:  ""When you watch a trader eat a sandwich while he presses enter on a $10 billion trade, you realize how small this game is. We are going to have a lot of volume and that's not bad, in fact that is the first step to reducing volatility.""  The 2017 bull run combined with scaling tension has led to a sustained increase in bitcoin volatility over 2017, breaking the five-year down trend.  The regulated futures markets and potential ETFs may be the antidote; deepening liquidity, closing the spreads and reducing the volatility, all of which will contribute to greater market efficiency, price discovery and ultimately ensure bitcoin will be a better store of value and medium of exchange.  Knowledge is Power  But regardless of the tempting volatility, no sophisticated traders will jump into bitcoin without arming themselves with knowledge. It takes a time and breadth of disciplines to understand bitcoin and its many intricacies – as well as a little bit of faith.  To that end, the ""education"" phase is well underway, in fact the CFTC (Commodities Futures Trading Commission) launched an online information portal days prior to the bitcoin futures launch. Its aim is to educate the public on digital commodities.  This period of research and analysis will have many positive externalities ranging from more effective regulation to greater capital allocation efficiency within the crypto economy. So far, investing within the bitcoin ecosystem has largely been haphazard. Almost every single bitcoin company has underperformed against bitcoin itself.  A greater understanding of bitcoin will foster an ecosystem that allocates capital with greater efficacy, creating the value feedback loop more prevalent in cryptocurrencies such as ethereum.  Every healthy futures market needs a mixture of speculators and hedgers that hold the underlying assets. Typically for markets run by CME, this may be farmers looking to lock in the price of their harvests by short selling contracts of wheat, corn, etc.  Today, the bitcoin futures market is mostly comprised of speculators, and there is a lack of natural sellers as most traders would have to naked short (short without holding bitcoin). At Interactive Brokers, precautions are so great you need five times the collateral to make a trade. For a contract of $100,000, a trader would need $500,000 as margin.  To quote Richard Heart:  ""The history of bitcoin is shorts getting rekt, constantly.""  Revving up  Still, the ability to hedge the price of bitcoin alters the risk profile of other parts of the industry, particularly mining.  Expect more risk-averse companies to venture into mining industry. After announcing they would start mining the top 10 cryptocurrencies Digital Power Corp. saw a stock appreciation of 750 percent. Digital Power are not alone and numerous tech companies are jumping aboard the mining bandwagon.  With the ability to short sell bitcoin to ""lock in"" mining profits, these companies can do so with drastically reduced risk. For companies like Digital Power, instruments that provide shorting on indices will be invaluable. If this trend continues, Western mining corporations could start to chip away at the currently centralized mining hash power, with 80 percent of it residing in China.  But, it will take time for volumes to build and spreads to close as only a limited number of sophisticated investors are currently capable of carrying out the risky cash and carry arbitrage. No doubt that uncertainties surrounding forking, scaling and regulation will make bitcoin’s journey to an efficient market bumpy.  The most interesting part of bitcoin's rise to the regulated economy is that it took eight years of clamor, belief and HODLing.  To be sure, though, there's more hard work ahead.

42428333,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL7Gfh,1514048422,Utility: The Defining Word for Tokens in 2018,"Shawn Wilkinson is the co-founder and chief strategy officer at Storj Labs where he oversees strategy, vision and architecture for the Storj network.  The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review.      It's pretty clear that 2017 was the year of the token.  Whether you're reading the news, attending a trade show or just minding your own business working in your preferred coffee shop, you don't have to venture far to hear someone talking about another token sale. There are now more than 1,000 different digital tokens.  Keeping all this in perspective, it's no shock to anyone that the crypto community faces ever-increasing scrutiny, with regulation in its various forms stretching from China to the U.S. The biggest common denominator in the argument around cryptocurrency is whether the tokens in question truly do have an underlying utility.  The simple fact is that many tokens don't...  A recent article from Bloomberg reported that of 226 ICOs and token sales analyzed, only 20 of the corresponding tokens were actually used in the running of their networks, demonstrating utility of some sort – that’s less than 10 percent.  For many companies, utility appears to be an afterthought, but for a token to be successfully adopted into the community, it is the most critical component. With the amount of tokens on the market today, and new ones being launched every day, it’s clear there is a bubble, though the size of it might be debatable.  When the market slows, the tokens that have no utility will ultimately not have any value at all.  Opening the crypt  If you need further proof of the importance for utility, check out deadcoins.com, which acts as a digital mausoleum for the 600-plus cryptocurrencies and tokens that have given up the ghost.  As you look over the summaries of some of these coins, which could essentially be ""cause of death,"" you'll see notes like, ""trading with a market cap of $183,"" ""scam"" and ""shut down by SEC."" A good way to recap these failed ICOs is there was no functioning platform with proven utility. Tokens and platforms centered on utility will continue even if their creators move on or disappear.  Just look at BitShares and bitcoin as a few examples.  There are several benefits to creating utility with a cryptocurrency (beyond avoiding the SEC hammer). Building utility capabilities for your token inside your platform creates a healthy ecosystem. Even if you don't have people speculating on the value of your token and your token isn't listed on any of the big exchanges, it will be bought, sold and traded for services on your platform and amongst your community of users.  Delaying a product's build until after a successful token sale is also a huge lost opportunity.  Post-sale, you have thousands of excited, new community members that hold your token and want to see you succeed. If you have a working platform with utility, you can easily bring those new token holders into your broader community to grow adoption where it makes sense, and create massive momentum.  I expect that in 2018, it will be rare to see companies that issue token sales without some sort of product. For token holders, that should be a major requirement when doing their due diligence.  Secret recipes  And there are some really interesting ways companies are creating utility.  Here are a few that stand out to me:  Purchasing services: The baseline qualification for most companies issuing tokens should be that the token can be used to purchase services within their platform. Purchasing services with tokens accelerates the time it takes for a transaction to settle, it makes purchasing services easier and adds an element of privacy as well. In the beginning, when the company is scaling and spending more money than they are making, the volume of tokens exchanged for the purchase of services will be minimal, but as the company’s revenues grow, so will the token transfer rate. You don’t need to require tokens to purchase services, but providing the option (and possibly providing a discount for doing so) can go a long way in driving the use of your token.  Create a self-sustaining ecosystem: If you can create a marketplace that connects buyers and sellers, facilitating transactions utilizing your token you can create a self-sustaining ecosystem that is based on transacting your token. One example is Golem, which uses its GNT token to power its decentralized computing network. Companies in need of processing power pay with GNT, which is then used to pay individuals who share their computing power when their computers are idle. This creates a vast network that lives off the utility of GNT.  Automated smart contract payments: One of the areas for the biggest utility opportunity is enabling new capabilities with smart contracts. One of the benefits to smart contracts is that they enable automated payments that allow devices to autonomously participate in the network. Your smart fridge can't swipe its credit card at Amazon S3 to store its data, but I could set that up with Storj and STORJ token.The flexibility from smart contracts also allows other ethereum platforms to integrate on the back-end. At Storj, we have many blockchain companies who are integrating with us on the back-end. When a user at another company pays for their service using our partner's token, a portion of that cost can be converted to STORJ to pay for the storing of their data.  Room to explore  Still, smart contracts arguably have some of the most interesting utility examples, many of which have yet to be uncovered.  This is why the grand majority of token sales are for ERC-20 tokens, which leverage ethereum’s blockchain and its underlying smart contract technology. In fact, our team at Storj underwent a token sale this year that involved us migrating from a Counterparty token to an ERC-20 token. We saw the massive opportunity to leverage smart contracts and the de-facto standard for tokens within our platform.  This year has been a massive year for cryptocurrency, blockchain and smart contracts and I expect the coming year will be no less exciting. But, if 2017 was the year of the token, then 2018 will be the year of utility.  In the coming year, I expect we will see tokens that provide true utility float to the top. And in the process, there will likely be many more tokens left behind.

42428338,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL7Gph,1514036724,"Poof, Your Money's Gone: Building for Blockchain Users","Taylor Monahan is the founder of MyEtherWallet, an open-source, client-side interface for generating ethereum wallets and interacting with the ethereum blockchain.  The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review series.      It's easy to ignore how simple things are today, and even easier to miss how much larger things will be tomorrow.  We underestimate, misestimate, write off exponential as linear and react to the five-minute candlesticks as if they are the whole picture. Everything is relative. Unless we zoom out, we won't see that peaks are growing taller each day, nor that the valleys are barely blips given full context.  When we put together the first version of MyEtherWallet, we weren't trying the change the world. We were just building a wallet generator that didn't require the command-line. Two-and-a-half years later we've become the de-facto interface for interacting with the ethereum blockchain, especially when it comes to ethereum-based tokens.  This is not your typical journey.  But the fact that we were able to build a product in this fashion reveals more about the market than our own skills. Only in such a new and emerging space could we thrive building a product for ourselves. We knew what people wanted because we knew what we wanted. Early blockchain adopters, ourselves included, tend to hold more libertarian or anarchist views, have an intolerance for inefficiency, have a tolerance for risk, are tech-savvy, privacy-minded, innately curious, self-motivated and thoroughly enjoy the possibility of a better future.  However, the crypto-sphere is not a microcosm of the larger world; it's limited to those who see the potential future regardless of the experience today. Most do not enjoy reading research papers, let alone debating them on forums created before the iPhone existed.  Most value ease, automation and features over control of their data. This, combined with the online experiences we've grown accustomed to (insurance, mobile banking, ""undo"" buttons, password resets, live customer support) means throwing my mother onto the blockchain today would be a recipe for disaster.  This isn't because my mother is incapable or uninterested. It's because she lives in a world that operates differently than the blockchain world. Unlike those of us already in this space, she hasn't found the resources that shift her mind and trigger her ""rabbit-hole"" moment.  One can hope that the state of things today are not seen as the ""simple times"" tomorrow.  Ideally, looking back we'll have a nostalgic viewing of ""the early days."" The unpolished days. The days reserved for geeks and misfits and maniacs who believed in the ""why,"" but hadn't quite nailed the ""how.""  Cracking custody  Mike Belshe, the CEO of bitcoin storage service BitGo, was the first person to help me see the uniqueness of the cryptocurrency custody situation. He pointed out that if your house completely burns down while you are at work, you would lose less than if you lost your private key. The insurance will pay, your wallet and phone were with you at the time, your important documents are all in the cloud, and you can, however awful it may be, still stand in line at some government bureaucracy to get a new birth certificate.  More recently, Ryan McGeehan was helping us put together our security policy and included:  ""I am aware that cryptocurrency companies are a global anomaly to the security industry. I am aware that these companies are hacked into deletion at a far greater rate than any industry. I will walk through this industry's graveyard. I will look through this list and appreciate the scale of this problem.""  When it comes to cryptocurrency, a single string of characters can cause irrecoverable loss. This space mostly operates in a gray area in regards to taxation, regulation, security and jurisdiction. The loss of your private key results in the loss of your funds.  The theft of a private key results in tax-free, identity-free funds that can be mixed, siphoned, used to pay for products or services or converted into (essentially) clean fiat.  I've joked that MyEtherWallet needs to budget for the years of therapy our support and education team is going to need after spending their days, nights and weekends with people who have lost their funds. Whether it's phishing sites, malware, unsafe storage of keys, or other exceptionally creative ways (aka ""user error""), the worst part is the helplessness.  We can educate them about what went wrong, we can try to prevent it in the future, but we cannot make the keys reappear or return the funds. They're gone. Poof.  ""Poof"" should be a concept reserved for magicians and charlatans. The very real consequences of loss become evident as you spend time in this space and begin to understand the blockchain, cryptography, and key pairs. However, without this baseline knowledge, people only have their experiences with the traditional world (Gmail, Facebook, online banking) which leads to seemingly senseless loss.  When they lose, they don't care why or how, they care about a solution. With each passing bubble, those entering the space care less about the underlying technology and more about potential profits. The investments have become more irresponsible, the losses larger, and the reactions more accusatory, angry, and, at times, suicidal or homicidal.  The new blockchain user  Cryptocurrency is a global anomaly. Accept that. It is onerous, unique, and elusive. People are not stupid, they are uneducated on the idiosyncrasies of the blockchain.  Building a product for a limited demographic only works when that demographic dominates the market. As the market expands, what do you optimize for? Your original goals? Integration with traditional world? Decentralization? Security? Advanced users? Control? New users?  Growing up means figuring out what you stand for and what you want to stand for. For a product, that means making decisions that are in line with your philosophies and then aligning your user's expectations with your offerings. It means focusing your efforts on the best solution for the people you are building for, not an amalgamation of all the possible solutions. It is becoming apparent that the policies, systems, fees and regulations that we vehemently rebel against exist for a reason. They can subsidize refunds for fraudulent transactions. They can shut down accounts. They can protect innocent ignorants from being scammed.  A single product cannot effectively address the full spectrum of a user's needs and expectations when it comes to custody. One company cannot simultaneously give you your private key while offering two-factor authentication. A team cannot hold your funds while allowing you to send wherever you want, whenever you want. An interface cannot perfectly automate and hide the shifting variables (e.g. ethereum's gas costs) while you generate that transaction via an air-gapped device in the middle of a field covered in foil.  A more diverse population of users demands a more diverse population of custody solutions. It demands a more diverse talent pool to build these products, help people understand the blockchain and help the blockchain understand people.  We need products that optimize for ease-of-use over advanced features. We need third-party funds with insurance that hold and grow your investments. We need multi-factor solutions that target traditional businesses and can work within their established accounting practices. We need systems for transparency for ICOs and charities. We need teams that focus on ultra-private solutions for those in high-risk situations, or simply value control above all else.  We also need resources that target the growing ecosystem.  This means resources for institutions, my mom, and the kids who have been Snapchatting since they were 10 years old. We need tools for the unbanked, the banked and the over-banked. We need documentation and research so that those who have the expertise can use their advanced skills to advance the systems. We need the teachers who know the technology inside and out, and those who have the perfectly accessible analogy for everything.  The opportunity  To have a better future, we have to start building it today.  The people building it must be as diverse as the people who will be part of it. It's easier if those who are part of it are the ones building it. It can't just be technical experts or big corporations. Not every project requires millions of dollars or advanced college degrees. It requires both researchers at universities and teens with YouTube channels. It's publishers, writers, and random commenters who to take the time hold someone's hand and bring them onboard. It's talking, sharing, connecting, and iterating.  But mostly, it's realizing that those who change the world don't always set out to do so. All it takes is a decision to do something today, do it better tomorrow, and to not stop doing it...ever. One day, you'll lean back, zoom out, and realize the peaks and valleys that have consumed you were just the runway and the real lift-off has yet to occur.  Luckily, you're already on-board, building the ship, and there is no getting off now. The future is coming. HODL tight.
