Musk the Manipulator (MUSKMANI), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKMANI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk the Manipulator can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk the Manipulator could become the next viral memecoin. Musk the Manipulator launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk the Manipulator on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk the Manipulator by entering its contract address – DZpfk5LaLrnP6vSFJnLSMAopUuTJGiFk7543rQxh4ids – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKMANI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | SHIB | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/solana-memecoin-musk-the-manipulator-muskmani-to-rally-14000-before-exchange-listing/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

38024205,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=632516,1734996612,Prediction markets show 77% odds of a Magnificent 7 company will buy Bitcoin in 2025,"Prediction markets have gone ballistic. Kalshi, one of the sharpest platforms out there, says there’s now a 77% chance that one of the Magnificent 7 companies (Apple, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Tesla, Nvidia, or Alphabet) will take the plunge and buy Bitcoin in 2025. A few months ago, those odds were sitting at 49%. What happened? Michael Saylor, a man who treats Bitcoin like religion, has been out here pushing companies like Microsoft to stop playing it safe and start stacking sats. Let’s call it what it is: the market smells blood, and by blood, we mean Bitcoin. 2025 could be even better than 2024 has already been. These guys have been circling the crypto waters for years, and the odds are now higher than ever that one of them is finally going to bite. Let’s take a look at what they think about Bitcoin *now.* Alphabet keeps Bitcoin at arm’s length Company number one is Alphabet, Google’s parent company, which has been doing that thing where it dips a toe into the crypto pool but doesn’t want to admit it’s swimming. Back in 2018, it banned crypto ads altogether because, apparently, scams are bad for business. Fast-forward to this year, and they seem like they’ve realized blockchain technology might actually be worth something. Google Cloud is exploring blockchain for enterprise clients, focusing on things like security and transparency. Meanwhile, Alphabet’s financials are looking good. Google Cloud revenue hit $11.4 billion in Q3, up 35%. The company’s stock is up more than 30% since September, making it a top performer in that market. Amazon’s boardroom brawl Amazon’s shareholders aren’t exactly the same though. In December, they told the board to put their money where the future is. Specifically, they want Amazon to invest 5% of its $88 billion in cash reserves into Bitcoin. That’s $4.4 billion, for those keeping score at home. But wait, there’s more. Insiders reportedly say Amazon is already thinking about dropping $250 million on Bitcoin. Why? Because new accounting rules from the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) make it easier to hold crypto on the books. Meanwhile, rumors are going around that Amazon could start accepting Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano as payment soon. Amazon’s stock is trading at $225, up 20% for the year. With a market cap of $2.36 trillion, they’re incredibly powerful. If they jump into Bitcoin, it’ll be like Tyson stepping into a middleweight ring. Apple sticks to its lane As for Apple, it isn’t exactly rushing to buy Bitcoin. Instead, they’re making it easier for their customers to buy it. Earlier this month, the company partnered with Coinbase to let users buy cryptos directly through Apple Pay. That’s all we got on them for now. Apple’s stock is trading at $180, with a market cap north of $2.8 trillion. They’re playing it safe, but their users? Not so much. Might be time to give the people what they want. Meta pivots to NFTs while Microsoft backs the blockchain Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook, has been pushing NFTs hard, integrating them into Instagram and Facebook. Reports say NFT transactions on Meta’s platforms are up 40% since launch. But let’s not forget Meta’s bigger play: the metaverse. They’re betting on blockchain to power virtual transactions, and that means they’re not done with crypto yet. Meanwhile, Microsoft is keeping things corporate. Azure, its cloud platform, has rolled out Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS). Over 500 companies are already using it to build decentralized apps. Microsoft is also throwing cash at startups in DeFi and NFTs. The stock is $380 a share and the company has a $2.8 trillion market cap. But when Michael Saylor suggested that they add Bitcoin to their balance sheet just some weeks back, they told him NO. Tesla and Nvidia: Bitcoin holdings and mining wars Tesla’s Bitcoin story is well-known. They’ve got $1.5 billion in Bitcoin on their books and are thinking about bringing back Bitcoin payments for their cars. Elon Musk might be polarizing, but Tesla’s crypto strategy isn’t. They’re holding steady while pushing for greener mining practices. Their stock? Trading at $280, with a market cap of $900 billion. Then there’s Nvidia. Their GPUs are the backbone of crypto mining, especially for Bitcoin miners. But Nvidia’s relationship with crypto isn’t all roses. They’re facing a Supreme Court case over allegations they misled investors about crypto revenue back in 2018. Still, their stock is trading at $140, with a market cap of $3.42 trillion. Legal drama aside, the company has staged nothing short of a remarkable performance this year.

Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, has shown steady performance, currently trading around $3,315, highlighting its resilience in the volatile crypto space. Meanwhile, EOS is making waves with strategic initiatives and partnerships aimed at improving scalability and usability. At the same time, Qubetics ($TICS) has achieved an impressive milestone with its presale success, selling over 372 million tokens to more than 11,500 holders. Qubetics is setting itself apart by tackling the complexities of cryptocurrency management, making it accessible and efficient for users worldwide. Qubetics ($TICS): Revolutionizing Crypto Transactions Qubetics is breaking barriers with its Non-Custodial Multi Chain Wallet, designed to simplify cryptocurrency management. By integrating with payment solutions like Apple Pay and Google Pay, the wallet aims to make crypto transactions as seamless as everyday payments, whether you’re on iOS, Android, or desktop. A standout feature of the Qubetics wallet is its smart contract conversion mechanism. This tool automatically converts digital assets into fiat currencies at the point of sale, protecting users from market volatility and ensuring smooth transactions. For example, imagine a global freelancer who deals with clients paying in various cryptocurrencies. With Qubetics, payments are instantly converted to their desired fiat currency, eliminating exchange rate concerns and market fluctuations. Currently, the Qubetics presale is in its 14th stage, having sold over 372 million tokens and raising $7.5 million. At $0.0377 per token, now’s the perfect time for investors to join before the price increases by 10% in the upcoming 15th stage this weekend. With its mission to bridge the gap between traditional finance and digital assets, Qubetics is making a significant impact in the crypto world. Ethereum (ETH): Consistent Growth and Network Upgrades Ethereum continues to solidify its position as a leading cryptocurrency. Trading at approximately $3,315, Ethereum has shown steady growth even amidst market volatility. Its consistent performance highlights the trust and reliance the crypto community places in Ethereum. Ethereum 2.0 upgrades have been instrumental in enhancing the platform’s scalability, security, and energy efficiency. These improvements have attracted more developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) on its network, further boosting its utility and adoption. Consider a scenario where a startup leverages Ethereum’s blockchain for smart contracts. The platform’s robust infrastructure and widespread adoption make it an ideal choice for businesses looking to implement secure and scalable blockchain solutions. As decentralized finance (DeFi) continues to flourish, Ethereum remains a critical foundation for the ecosystem. Analysts predict that with growing institutional interest and network developments, Ethereum could reach new milestones in the coming year, reaffirming its place among the best cryptos to buy in December 2024. EOS (EOS): Aiming for Scalable Solutions EOS is carving its niche in the competitive world of cryptocurrencies by focusing on scalability and developer-friendly infrastructure. Currently trading at approximately $0.79, EOS has experienced fluctuations but remains a viable option for dApp developers. Recent partnerships and upgrades have aimed at improving transaction speeds and reducing costs, positioning EOS as a cost-effective alternative for blockchain-based applications. For instance, a gaming company exploring blockchain integration for in-game assets can benefit from EOS’s efficient infrastructure to provide a seamless user experience. Despite challenges, EOS’s community remains active, driving forward initiatives that enhance the platform’s utility and adoption. Its ability to cater to developers seeking scalable solutions makes it a noteworthy player in the blockchain space. Conclusion The crypto market offers diverse opportunities, and Qubetics, Ethereum, and EOS are leading the way. Qubetics is redefining digital transactions with its innovative wallet, Ethereum continues to dominate with consistent growth and network enhancements, and EOS is providing scalable solutions for dApp developers. Based on the latest research, we recommend considering Qubetics ($TICS), Ethereum (ETH), and EOS (EOS) as some of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024 .

Per Hanguk Kyungjae , the FSC told media representatives the reports were “not true.” Will Regulator Let South Korean Companies Buy Crypto? Reports circulated at the start of the month claiming that the FSC was prepared to allow universities and schools to trade donations made in crypto for fiat. This, the reports claimed, would represent the first step on a roadmap. This same roadmap would eventually allow South Korean firms to buy coins like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) , they added. [Press Release] The Financial Services Commission held a meeting to review business financing conditions and response strategies with officials from policy financial institutions and related businesses on December 19. https://t.co/QtSVRIB88h — Financial Services Commission – FSC Korea (@FSC_Korea) December 19, 2024 The reports also claimed that the FSC would let “ordinary” firms buy crypto before the banking sector. “We are still discussing whether we will allow corporations [to buy and sell crypto]. The reports are not true. The Financial Services Commission’s Virtual Assets Division has not confirmed anything about this matter.” South Korean Financial Services Commission spokesperson South Korean law does not explicitly prevent firms from holding crypto. However, to trade BTC, ETH, and altcoins, private individuals need to open crypto exchange -linked bank accounts. The regulator’s guidelines instruct financial institutions to reject all such applications from corporate clients. South Korea aims to issue its first won-denominated foreign-exchange stabilization debt in more than two decades next month, according to a finance ministry official with direct knowledge of the plan https://t.co/Wu0tz7iRD3 — Bloomberg Markets (@markets) December 23, 2024 Bitcoin ETF Approval Facing Further Delay? The earlier reports claimed that government ministries, local government organs, universities, and charities would be allowed to sell off any crypto they hold “in the first half of 2025.” Some South Korean companies are furious. They claim they have been left behind by their international rivals in the US and Japan. American firms like MicroStrategy and Japanese companies like Remixpoint have built up considerable Bitcoin reserves in recent years. However, the FSC has refused to allow South Korean companies to do likewise. It has claimed that further discussion is required beforehand. The same FSC spokesperson also denied reports that the regulator had scheduled a timeframe for approving crypto spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The official also said these reports were “completely groundless,” adding: “We have not discussed the timing of the launch of virtual asset ETFs.” Crypto hackers from North Korea stole $1.3 billion in funds in 2024, new data released this week from Chainalysis shows. #NorthKorea #CryptoHackers https://t.co/TQYgKiaQ22 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 20, 2024 ‘Huge Demand’ Other media outlets, citing anonymous sources, have claimed the FSC is still consulting with “ministries, organizations, and private experts” before deciding on new crypto regulations. They believe the FSC is hesitant about allowing companies to buy and hold crypto. They think regulators are concerned that approval would drive up the already high demand for crypto exchange and crypto custody services. Earlier this month, Kim Seo-jun, the CEO of the blockchain accelerator Hashed, spoke of “a huge institutional demand for Bitcoin ETFs” in South Korea and beyond.

In its latest Digital Asset Fund Flows report , CoinShares says that last week, institutional crypto investment products saw net inflows of $308 million. “Digital asset investment products saw a continuation of inflows last week totaling US$308m, although this masks the largest single day of outflows on the 19th December totaling US$576m, with total outflows in the final 2 days of last week at US$1bn.” Source: CoinShares According to CoinShares, last week’s hawkish Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) release resulted in a $17.7 billion loss in assets under management (AuM) by crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs). “While these outflows may sound alarming, they comprise just 0.37% of total AuM, ranking as the 13th largest single-day outflow on record. The largest single-day outflow took place in mid-2022, when the FOMC interest rate hike prompted US$540m outflows (2.3% of AuM.)” Bitcoin ( BTC ), per usual, led the way with $375 million in inflows. While Ethereum ( ETH ) and XRP products enjoyed $51.3 million and $8.8 million in inflows each, multi-asset investment products, those investing in a basket of cryptos instead of just one, saw a significant uptick in outflows. “The most dramatic flows were from multi-asset investment products, which saw US$121m of outflows last week.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The company announced today that it has purchased 619.7 BTC for $61 million – including fees and other expenses – making it the firm’s largest Bitcoin acquisition to date. Metaplanet Increases BTC Holdings To 1,762 The recent crypto market downturn from its all-time highs (ATH) does not appear to bother Metaplanet, as the Tokyo-listed firm made its largest BTC purchase to date, buying 619.7 BTC worth $ 61 million at an average price of around $96,000. Related Reading: Metaplanet To Expand Bitcoin Holdings With $11.3 Million Bond Sale To recall, Metaplanet started buying BTC earlier this year in May with a purchase of 97.9 BTC. Since then, the company has purchased BTC every month, barring September, and crossed the 1,000 BTC milestone in November. The latest acquisition has pushed Metaplanet’s total Bitcoin holdings to 1,762, bought at an average price of $75,600 per BTC. Notably, this $61 million purchase is nearly double the value of Metaplanet’s previous largest acquisition, which occurred in November and was worth close to $30 million. The company’s consistent BTC accumulation has earned it the nickname “Asia’s MicroStrategy,” in reference to the US-based business intelligence firm known for its aggressive Bitcoin buying strategy. It is worth highlighting that today’s BTC purchase comes a week after Metaplanet raised $60.6 million through two tranches of bond issuance for the purpose of “accelerating BTC purchases.” Metaplanet’s latest purchase also makes its BTC reserves the 12th-largest among publicly listed firms globally. According to Metaplanet’s official announcement, its BTC Yield – a proprietary metric used to measure the performance of its Bitcoin acquisition strategy – stood at 310% from October 1 to December 23. The firm emphasized that this strategy is designed to be “accretive to shareholders.” Despite today’s significant BTC purchase, Metaplanet’s stock price saw little movement, closing at $22.5, down 0.98% for the day. However, on a year-to-date basis, the company’s stock has surged by an astounding 1,982%, reflecting the long-term benefits of its Bitcoin-centric strategy. Bitcoin Supply Crunch To Hasten Adoption? With Bitcoin’s total maximum supply capped at 21 million, the digital asset has solidified its reputation as an inflation-resistant store of value. A recent report highlights that BTC supply on crypto exchanges has hit multi-year lows, indicating that holders are increasingly withdrawing BTC from exchanges, reducing circulating supply and potentially driving prices higher. Related Reading: Bitcoin Adoption Grows As Rumble Unveils $20 Million BTC Treasury Strategy Bitcoin’s scarcity has triggered an unofficial race among corporations – and possibly even governments. For instance, Bitcoin mining firm Hut 8 recently purchased 990 BTC for $100 million, increasing its total holdings to over 10,000 BTC. Similarly, MARA, another Bitcoin mining company, acquired 703 BTC earlier this month, bringing its total holdings to 34,794 BTC. Speculations surrounding a potential US strategic Bitcoin reserve are further strengthening BTC’s supply crunch narrative, which may fast-track its adoption. At press time, BTC trades at $94,003, down 1.5% in the past 24 hours. Featured image from Unsplash, charts from Yahoo!

The potential reasons behind this bullish outlook include the current market sentiment and the positive price action that ADA has displayed in recent days. ADA Technical Analysis and Upcoming level Since the beginning of December 2024, ADA has experienced a price decline of over 40%, falling below the $1 level. However, with notable attention from traders and investors, the altcoin’s price appears to be recovering and gaining upward momentum. According to expert technical analysis, ADA appears to be consolidating within a tight range near a strong resistance level of $0.95. Based on recent price action and historical momentum, if ADA breaks out of the consolidation zone and closes a daily candle above the $1 mark, there is a strong possibility it could surge by 30% to reach the $1.25 level in the coming days. Source: Trading View Conversely, if the altcoin fails to close above this level and falls below the $0.85 mark, it may find support around the $0.72 level in the future. On a positive note, ADA’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands near the oversold area, indicating potential upside momentum in the days ahead. On-Chain Metrics Support ADA’s Bullish Outlook This bullish outlook appears to have attracted both long-term holders and traders, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . Data from ADA’s spot inflow/outflow reveals that exchanges have witnessed an outflow of a significant $98 million worth of ADA tokens in the past week. Sourcr: Coinglass In addition to long-term holders, trader participation seems to have skyrocketed. According to the data, ADA’s open interest has surged by 8%, indicating heightened trader activity and suggesting potential upside momentum. Current Price Momentum At press time, ADA is trading near $0.94 and has experienced a price surge of over 5.10% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume jumped by 18% and continues to rise steadily, indicating heightened participation from traders and investors following the bullish outlook.",POSITIVE,ADA,ADA | ALTCOIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/cardano-ada-price-could-soar-30-but-theres-a-catch/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png
38025651,https://cryptonews.com/?p=322215,1734994315,Will a Santa Rally Save ADA? Cardano Price Needs to Break This Level to Revive Rally,"The Cardano (ADA) price is holding above its 50DMA in the low $0.90s on Monday, as the cryptocurrency market attempts the beginnings of a rebound during a holiday-shortened week. The final trading days are normally bullish in the stock market, with the crypto bulls also hoping for a recovery after last week’s Fed-fuelled market rout. The Cardano price dropped as low as $0.76 last week, and at current levels above $0.92, it remains 30% down from the highs it hit in early December above $1.30. The Fed shocked markets last week by only forecasting two rate cuts in 2025, less than hoped for. Whilst that has created short-term macro headwinds, crypto has plenty of bullish narratives to fall back on that could support a recovery into the year’s end. Namely, the incoming Trump administration and Congress are more pro-crypto than most crypto investors/industry participants could have possibly imagined just a few months ago. That means crypto is on the cusp of entering a new golden age, at least in the US, next year. ADA was hurt badly in recent years by regulatory uncertainty. However, the prospect of its founder Charles Hopkinson becoming an advisor to incoming US President Trump on crypto affairs means the future for the Cardano ecosystem is likely very bright. Cardano in 2025 will be insane — Deezy.eth (@deezy_BTC) December 23, 2024 The recent market turmoil, thus, likely isn’t the end of altcoins. Rather, its more likely to have just been a hiccup. However, a rally at the end of the year hasn’t been confirmed yet. Here are the levels that Cardano needs to clear. Cardano Price Recovery Into The Year’s End? ADA Needs to Clear This Level A key level of resistance that might block the Cardano price from advancing into the year’s end is around $1.0. Not only is this a key level of psychological significance, but it also lines up with the downtrend form the yearly highs. Once this level breaks, the likelihood of a retest of yearly highs shoots up. But, for now, ADA remains in a technical downtrend, so in the absence of a broader recovery in risk appetite, traders shouldn’t be surprised if the market reverses lower again in the short-term. However, for those with the ability to hold through short-term price bumps, 2025 promises to be a spectacular year for major altcoins like Cardano. A realistic target for this bull market would be the 1.618 Fibonacci extension of the 2023 lows traced back to the 2021 record highs just above $3.0, which is near $5.0. That could mean Cardano could still deliver gains of as much as 5x from current levels, despite already being up around 3x from its October levels. Of course, many bulls are predicting even bigger things for the Cardano price, but no one can really be sure how high the crypto will fly during the upcoming bull market. Cardano to $10 — Crypto Jebb (@_CoffeeNCrypto_) December 23, 2024 That means Cardano is a strong candidate for best crypto to buy right now . However, a concern is the lack of major adoption of the blockchain, despite having been around for many years and boasting a large and dedicated community. Rather than putting their eggs all in one basket, a better strategy in crypto is to diversify amongst different coins. Bitcoin , the most established crypto that continues to lead global adoption (national strategic reserves coming in 2025?), should probably be the cornerstone of any investor’s portfolio. Other major altcoins like Ethereum , Solana and XRP also warrant consideration. But ADA certainly has its place, and could be a major winner in the long run. The post Will a Santa Rally Save ADA?

The new sports event trading product allows users to bet on events like the National Football League’s Super Bowl. Before this time, not much was heard of the prediction market. During the 2024 US presidential, the niche became quite popular, a success that could be attributed to Polymarket. In a blog post , Crypto.com informed its customers, “Sports Event Trading is a CFTC-regulated derivatives trading feature available in the Crypto.com App and on the Crypto.com Web.” “It presents you with a straightforward Yes/No decision based on whether you believe an outcome of a sporting event will occur,” the crypto exchange added. Crypto.com Prediction Market: Shift from Polymarket In the days leading to the November 5th US election, Polymarket recorded more than $3 billion in bets. One French man went home with almost $80 million just for placing a wager on Donald Trump winning the election. So far, Polymarket has secured approximately $1 billion of bets that attempted to predict which team will win the next Super Bowl in February. Once Crypto.com’s sports prediction market is activated, Polymarket may have to share its dominance to accommodate the new addition. The crypto exchange’s existing roots in the sports industry may serve as an edge for gaining traction quickly. In August, Crypto.com signed a multi-year partnership with the UEFA Champions League. As a result, the exchange became the official sponsor of Europe’s top tournament soccer club. Crypto.com Picks And Drops Lawsuit Against SEC In another Crypto.com news, the global exchange has decided against moving forward with its lawsuit against the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Two months ago, Crypto.com filed a lawsuit against the US SEC involving Gary Gensler and the agency’s four Commissioners. The legal action responded to an initial Wells Notice, but Crypto.com took no chance before filing a lawsuit. The exchange is challenging what it perceives as an unlawful expansion of SEC jurisdiction over its operations. This latest development followed after a meeting between the exchange’s CEO, Kris Marszalek, and President-elect Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago on December 16.

Between December 16 and 22, MicroStrategy acquired 5,262 BTC, investing approximately $561 million, the company announced on December 23. The firm purchased Bitcoin at an average price of roughly $106,662 per BTC, marking the highest cost it has ever paid for the cryptocurrency. As of December 22, 2024, MicroStrategy and its subsidiaries held a total of 444,262 BTC, acquired for a cumulative $27.7 billion at an average price of $62,257 per BTC. The latest purchase is part of a December buying spree, during which the company accumulated 42,162 BTC now valued at $4 billion. However, the latest acquisition accounts for only about 12% of the company’s total December purchases and represents the smallest amount of BTC bought since mid-2024, when it acquired 169 BTC. MicroStrategy’s latest Bitcoin purchase is 191% smaller than the acquisition announced on December 16 and 309% smaller than the one disclosed on December 9. The slowdown in BTC buying coincides with concerns raised by BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes about a potential market drop tied to the inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Hayes’ fund, Maelstrom, plans to clear some positions and re-enter the market later at lower prices. Additionally, rumors suggest MicroStrategy may enter a blackout period in January 2025, halting its issuance of shares and convertible bonds to fund further Bitcoin purchases. Despite market uncertainties, Saylor remains committed to Bitcoin. “I’m sure that I will be buying Bitcoin at $1 million a coin — probably $1 billion dollars a day of Bitcoin at $1 million a coin,” Saylor said in early December.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/microstrategy-buys-bitcoin-at-record-high-prices-amid-market-speculation/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

William Shane Garrow – who was senior vice president and a private banker at BOK until being fired early this year – is accused of embezzling $4,277,227 from at least 16 customer accounts and funneling the funds to himself, FOX23 reports . Garrow, who was hired in 2007, allegedly began committing the crimes on September 9, 2012, and continued all the way to April 10, 2024. He’s accused of draining cash from customer accounts without them knowing and transferring the funds to accounts that he controlled at other financial institutions. He’s also alleged to have written false cashier checks from client accounts and made them payable to himself. If a client noticed discrepancies, Garrow simply told them there was some sort of error, and that BOK would correct it. Says an affidavit seen by FOX23, “[Garrow] knowingly executed, and attempted to execute, a scheme…to defraud a financial institution, and to obtain any of the moneys, funds, credits, assets, and other property owned by…a financial institution.” Garrow is facing one count of bank fraud along with a separate count of willfully making and subscribing a false federal income tax return. In a statement to the media, BOK said it is cooperating with law enforcement. “Shane Garrow’s employment was terminated earlier this year upon the discovery that he had breached company policy.

Despite this, Japan-based Metaplanet has reaffirmed its confidence by buying nearly 620 BTC. Interestingly, the latest acquisition marks its largest Bitcoin purchase to date. Metaplanet’s Largest Single BTC Acquisition According to the company’s official press release , the acquisition, executed as part of its Bitcoin Treasury Operations, involved the purchase of 619.7 BTC, worth around $60.6 million. This latest transaction brings Metaplanet’s total Bitcoin holdings to 1,761.98 BTC, which is valued at almost $168 million. Over the past six months, Metaplanet has leveraged multiple capital market activities, including stock rights issuances and zero-coupon bonds, to fund its Bitcoin purchases. Most recently, the company raised ¥5 billion, valued at $31.9 million, through its 5th Series of Ordinary Bonds on December 20, 2024. Prior to that, the Tokyo-based investment firm also announced a separate ¥4.5 billion, valued at $28.7 million, bond issuance that is set to mature on June 16, 2025. The firm reported a staggering BTC Yield increase of nearly 310% between October 1 and December 23, 2024, demonstrating the significant growth in Bitcoin holdings relative to its fully diluted shares outstanding. Metaplanet appears to have firmly positioned itself as a key player in a corporate Bitcoin investment even as the broader market sentiment remains bearish. Boost From Bitcoin Metaplanet, often referred to as “Asia’s MicroStrategy,” began accumulating BTC in May, mirroring the strategy of the US-based Bitcoin-focused firm. The company recently revealed that it expects its first operating profit in seven years, thanks to its decision in April to use Bitcoin as a treasury asset. For fiscal year 2024, it forecasts a revenue increase to ¥890 million, worth around $5.8 million, from ¥261 million, and predicts an operating profit of ¥270 million. This marked a significant turnaround after years of losses. A key driver has been its innovative use of Bitcoin put options, which brought in ¥520 million. The firm also benefited from a strong performance at its Royal Oak Hotel in Tokyo.

With a straightforward approach, including a no-tax policy and transparency about its lack of utility, it has resonated with those who enjoy the lighthearted side of the crypto world. In 2023, PEPE experienced a meteoric rise, reaching a peak market cap of $1.6 billion and sparking a meme coin season. Early investors reaped significant profits, and a passionate community rallied around the project. PEPE’s roadmap outlines ambitions for major exchange listings and a meme takeover. While its future performance remains uncertain, for those drawn to the high-risk, high-reward nature of meme coins, PEPE presents an intriguing option in the current market landscape. Shiba Inu Shiba Inu began as a playful nod to Dogecoin but has forged its own path. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB runs on the Ethereum blockchain, tapping into its vast ecosystem. SHIB’s integration with Ethereum opens doors to various applications. One example is ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange for trading tokens. Plans for an NFT platform and a DAO-based governance system could give SHIB more utility. In the current market, SHIB stands out for its unique features and strong community. While meme coins are known for volatility, SHIB’s utility might make it more appealing. As the crypto market evolves, SHIB could be one to watch for those interested in memes with real-world use.

Donald Saves Crypto (DONALCRY), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONALCRY is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald Saves Crypto can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald Saves Crypto could become the next viral memecoin. Donald Saves Crypto launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald Saves Crypto on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald Saves Crypto by entering its contract address – Gyy3ss5Yj2ioZWuz6BNbDPGUGUxhwoCskRuU2cGo9k2Q – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONALCRY. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/donald-saves-crypto-donalcry-solana-memecoin-will-explode-over-18000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png
38022181,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52977,1734992227,These Major Banks Join Ripple to Create a SWIFT Alternative,"In a recent development that has gotten significant attention in the financial and blockchain communities, Edo Farina, CEO of Alpha Lions Academy, highlighted a key milestone for Ripple. A publication from the Chamber of Digital Commerce and Structured Finance sheds light on major global banks collaborating with Ripple to create a potential alternative to SWIFT, the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication. The financial institutions mentioned—Bank of America, Santander, UniCredit, Standard Chartered, Westpac Banking Corporation, and Royal Bank of Canada—represent a substantial segment of the global banking industry. Their collaboration with Ripple underscores a pivotal shift in how financial transactions might be conducted, moving towards the adoption of blockchain technology for cross-border payments. BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM GAME OVER! $XRP BANK OF AMERICA, SANTANDER, UNICREDIT, STANDARD CHARTERED, WESTPAC, AND ROYAL BANK OF CANADA ALL JOINED @Ripple TO CREATE AN ALTERNATIVE TO SWIFT Source: https://t.co/wmjvaetFBH pic.twitter.com/wMP7NyZ6gY — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) December 21, 2024 Blockchain as a Disruptive Force in Finance The financial services industry has increasingly turned to blockchain technology to address inefficiencies in traditional systems. Blockchain’s ability to process secure and bilateral transactions in near real-time offers a significant advantage over legacy systems, which can be slow, expensive, and prone to error. Using distributed ledger technology, Ripple aims to simplify and accelerate global money movement while reducing associated costs. Traditionally, SWIFT has dominated the cross-border payments space, serving as the backbone for international transactions. However, its reliance on multiple intermediaries often results in delays and increased transaction fees. Through innovative blockchain solutions, Ripple promises instant settlements with reduced costs and a robust audit trail, making it a formidable alternative to SWIFT. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The participation of major banks in this initiative reflects growing confidence in blockchain’s potential to transform global financial systems. Ripple’s established network, RippleNet, allows financial institutions to connect seamlessly, facilitating secure and efficient international transactions. The Future of Cross-Border Payments The collaboration signifies a notable moment for blockchain adoption in traditional banking. By leveraging Ripple’s technology, these banks aim to reduce the capital tied up in the global trade settlement system and enhance the speed and reliability of their services. This move aligns with a broader industry trend of adopting blockchain to improve transparency, security, and efficiency in financial transactions. While the details of this collaboration are still emerging, the implications for the broader financial ecosystem are profound. If Ripple’s solutions prove successful, they could disrupt SWIFT’s longstanding dominance, paving the way for a new era in international finance.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Lightchain AI steals the spotlight as Cardano and Toncoin lose investor momentum. Table of Contents Cardano and Toncoin: A decline in investor confidence Why Lightchain AI shines Future outlook Cardano (ADA) and Toncoin (TON) are seeing their momentum slow as Lightchain AI (LCAI) emerges as a more promising opportunity in the market. Currently priced at just $0.003 in its presale phase, Lightchain AI is drawing attention for its potential to transform decentralized applications (dApps) and governance. Cardano and Toncoin: A decline in investor confidence Cardano and Toncoin have been seen as good blockchain plans, but new market signs show a drop in trust from investors. Cardano’s growth speed, though bold, often gets bad remarks for holdups in adding important parts, making some wonder if it can stay up with quicker changing systems. Likewise, Toncoin, with its special blockchain setup tied to the Telegram world, has a hard time keeping up due to few user͏s outside its small group. These issues have made investors skeptical, especially in a market where new projects give better chances for growth. Lightchain AI, for example, has changed its aim by offering a new AI-blockchain mix during its presale phase, pulling in investors looking for fresh ideas and gain. As such, ADA and TON are falling back to smart projects like LCAI. You might also like: Dogecoin targets $2 but Lightchain AI could be the winner with $10 and a 30,000x return Why Lightchain AI shines Lightchain AI distinguishes itself from Cardano and Toncoin through its integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with blockchain technology. Central to Lightchain AI’s architecture are the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) and the Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism. The AIVM is designed to optimize the execution of AI-specific tasks, enabling efficient and scalable dApps. Lightchain AI’s tokenomics are structured to ensure sustainability and equitable distribution. The total supply of LCAI tokens is capped at 10 billion, with 40% allocated for presale, 30% for ecosystem development, 20% for team and advisors, and 10% reserved for future partnerships and strategic initiatives. This allocation strategy aims to foster long-term value for ecosystem participants. Moreover, the roadmap for Lightchain AI is ambitious, focusing on the seamless integration of AI and blockchain to address challenges such as scalability, privacy, and trust. Key milestones include the development and deployment of the AIVM, implementation of the PoI consensus mechanism, and the launch of a suite of AI-driven dApps. LCAI’s presale phase is priced low at just $0.003 per token, offering investors an opportunity to buy into a potentially disruptive technology at an early stage and reap exponential returns. With limited tokens available during this phase, investors are scrambling to secure their piece of the future through LCAI. Future outlook The Lightchain AI presale has drawn significant attention from blockchain enthusiasts and investors who see its potential to transform the industry. With its future-oriented approach to integrating AI and blockchain, LCAI is positioned to lead the next wave of disruptive technologies. As Cardano and Toncoin experience a slowdown in investor confidence, LCAI’s momentum continues to build, making it the choice for those seeking growth and transformative technology in their blockchain investments.

As an “all-sport” meme coin, XYZ will blend utility with the playful nature of meme coins, making it more than just another trend. The project is backed by a clear roadmap and a vision for sustainable growth, setting it apart in the crowded crypto market. XYZVerse is currently in its presale phase, offering a golden opportunity for early investors to secure tokens at discounts before its expected surge. The presale began at $0.0001 per token. As each presale stage progresses, the price rises incrementally, targeting a final level of $0.1 — a potential 7,402% increase from its current price. In the ongoing stage 9, XYZ is priced at $0.001333, already delivering a 1,300% surge for those who joined early. Over $3.5 million has been raised so far, and momentum is only growing. As XYZVerse progresses through its presale and prepares for public listing, its ecosystem expansion and roadmap milestones will be key to its success.

This surge sparked a meme coin season, with new meme coins popping up and experiencing wild price swings. PEPE’s roadmap includes plans for major exchange listings and aims for a “meme takeover.” Whether PEPE will reach new heights remains uncertain, but with the hopes for a bull run, many traders are watching closely.

This approach sets it apart in the current market, where cooperation is becoming more important. The Stellar Development Foundation, supported initially by Stripe, helps promote the network’s use.

38021440,https://blockworks.co/news/mrgns-co-founder-product-controversy,1734990590,Mrgn’s co-founder built a new product. Some ex-colleagues aren’t fans.,"This is a segment from the Lightspeed newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . Marginfi co-founder Edgar Pavlovsky departed suddenly from the Solana DeFi project in April. The split wasn’t exactly amicable. “I don’t agree with the way things have been done internally or externally,” Pavlovsky wrote on X at the time. Now, eight months later, Pavlovsky is a core contributor to Paladin, a Solana client meant to protect validators from so-called sandwich attacks while helping them “earn more in block rewards.” Around the same time, Temporal, a crypto research shop with multiple marginfi-linked members, began advertising “Nozomi,” a proprietary quic client partially meant to prevent sandwich attacks. Temporal is legally distinct from mrgn and marginfi. Temporal said most of its staff never worked at marginfi. A Temporal researcher I spoke to was critical of the project being worked on by his former colleague. The two products aren’t the same, by both parties’ accounts, but they are both focused on the same niche. There’s one notable difference though — Pavlovsky’s Paladin has a token, while marginfi, controversially, has yet to debut a native coin. Temporal’s Nozomi infrastructure is built to land transactions as fast as possible. It also prevents sandwich attacks by only sending transactions to “whitelisted” Solana validators who are known not to attack users. The project pitches this as a way to democratize trading. “We have a ton of experience from our trading arm getting the best execution for what we want to do,” Jakob Povsic, a developer at Temporal, said. Temporal is “getting this level of sophistication for basically anyone.” Paladin, on the other hand, is a fork of the Jito-Solana client that identifies and drops sandwich attacks from transaction bundles and helps Solana validators prioritize transactions with high priority fees attached, Pavlovsky told me. Access to Paladin validators will eventually be gated with the yet-to-launch PAL token . I asked Pavlovsky if building a product with similar anti-sandwiching aims to his ex-colleagues at Temporal makes him want to compete more aggressively. “No, man, they’re like my children,” Pavlovsky said with a chuckle. “I’m stoked for them to win, stoked for them to build.” He said blockchain infrastructure creators tend to have too much of a winner-take-all mentality when, in fact, multiple businesses can succeed at the same time. Povsic showed less bonhomie. “I applaud them for going after sandwiching since [it’s] a big problem, but their approach is naive and very [self-serving] from what we are seeing,” he said of Paladin. Povsic added Paladin “arbitrarily” blocks some transactions based on a wide net of criteria, and sophisticated players will still be able to pull off sandwiches. And “forcing” its own token into the equation made matters worse for Povsic. Pavlovsky responded to the criticism by saying that its anti-sandwich tech is “obviously systematic, not arbitrary.” “[P]aladin is designed with sophisticated players in mind (and being tested comprehensively against sandwichers on the whole network). [W]e’re always happy to discuss tradeoffs,” Pavlovsky said in a text. “[We] think [Paladin] is extractive and would rather focus on open-source initiatives rather than sending a % of priority fees to [Bloxroute], who own 20% of the token supply. Nozomi is quite different in that it’s simply a product to help land transactions fast,” Temporal partner and mrgn research co-founder Ben Coverston said. The PAL token is an interesting part of the equation. Marginfi frequently draws criticism for its so-called points program that tracks user contribution to the platform. Points are frequently used to allocate token airdrops, but marginfi is one of the last major Solana DeFi protocols not to release a token. Pavlovsky never mentioned the lack of a marginfi token in his departure post in April 2024. I asked him if frustration at the platform not launching a token contributed to his leaving. “[I] am pro token and think the right time to ship one was [Q4] 2023,” Pavlovsky said in response.

Table of Contents Catzilla: The meme coin for crypto warriors Just a Chill Guy DEGEN BOOK OF MEME Catwifhat Conclusion Bitcoin’s potential surge to $125,000 could set the stage for a massive rally among top meme coins. Leading this charge is Catzilla Coin, a new meme coin poised to make significant gains. Catzilla: The meme coin for crypto warriors In a financial world dominated by chaos, Catzilla emerges as a beacon of hope for meme coin enthusiasts and investors. Built on a foundation of humor, innovation, and community strength, Catzilla isn’t just another coin — it’s a movement. Like a feline legend with infinite lives, Catzilla’s presale offers unparalleled opportunities. Starting at $0.0002 and escalating to $0.0016 through 14 stages, early adopters can ride a wave of potential gains exceeding 700%. With each stage, Catzilla evolves, empowering its community to unlock massive financial opportunities. While dogs have dominated the meme coin spotlight for years, the era of feline supremacy is here. Recent successes like MEW’s 103.7% climb and Popcat’s astonishing 157.44% surge are just the beginning. Catzilla is poised to outshine them, bringing a bold new narrative to the meme coin universe. Catzilla isn’t just a token; it’s a rallying cry against outdated systems. Its mission is to empower crypto warriors with governance rights, staking opportunities, and loyalty rewards, creating a thriving, transparent ecosystem. Each presale stage strengthens the community, building momentum for a market takeover. This isn’t just another investment opportunity — it’s a chance to join a movement that combines financial freedom, innovation, and community-driven action. Interested investors can join the Catzilla presale and unleash chaos on the competition. Just a Chill Guy Just a Chill Guy is trading between $0.15 and $0.32, showing signs of consolidation. Despite a price drop of over 30% in the past week, the coin’s RSI is around 47, hinting it may be nearing oversold territory. The stochastic indicator at about 19 also suggests potential upward momentum soon. If CHILLGUY breaks past the nearest resistance at $0.47, it could climb to the next level of $0.70, which would more than double its current price. With altcoin season approaching and both the 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages aligning at $0.18, a bullish crossover could be on the horizon for CHILLGUY. DEGEN DEGEN is trading between $0.009 and $0.014, showing signs of consolidation after recent dips. The nearest resistance is at $0.018732; a break above this could push the price to the next target of $0.025529. The RSI at 49.33 indicates that the coin is neither overbought nor oversold, suggesting room for upward movement. Despite a 1-month drop of 40.80%, DEGEN boasts a 6-month increase of 113.02%, highlighting strong long-term momentum. With the anticipated altcoin season and a global crypto bull run on the horizon, DEGEN could be poised for substantial growth, making it a coin to watch closely.

The support level at $0.003706 indicates solid backing, minimizing downside risk. The MACD level is positive, suggesting bullish momentum. With the 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages closely aligned around $0.006247, any upward movement could signal a strong trend. As the altcoin season approaches and the crypto market heats up, BOME is a coin to watch. Catwifhat Catwifhat is currently trading between $0.000000256 and $0.000000346. The price hovers just below its 100-day simple moving average of $0.0000002695, indicating potential upward movement. If CWIF breaks above the nearest resistance at $0.000000437, it could rally towards the next target of $0.000000576, representing a possible gain of over 66%. With the altcoin season approaching and overall bullish sentiment in the crypto market, CWIF might soon surge past current levels. Traders are watching the MACD levels closely as a shift from the negative -0.000000000386 could signal a strong uptrend. Conclusion While CHILLGUY, DEGEN, BOME, and CWIF may have limited short-term potential, Catzilla emerges as the ultimate meme coin hero aiming to bring financial freedom to everyone.

38021327,https://thecoinrise.com/kaspersky-exposes-shocking-crypto-scam-details/,1734990097,Kaspersky Exposes Shocking Crypto Scam: Details,"Malicious actors are on the prowl again with a new scam meant to defraud unsuspecting crypto users. The trick has been exposed by Russia’s cyber security firm, Kaspersky. In a blog post , Kaspersky highlighted that these scammers deliberately drop seed phrases on YouTube comments. Notably, the approach differs from phishing emails targeting victims , sometimes including top crypto executives. The Scam Unveiled The malicious actors’ mode of operation is to include a seemingly harmless message in the comment section of a finance YouTube video. For instance, the scammer could share their seed phrase and seek “help” to move funds from their wallets. According to experts, that move alone marks the request as highly suspicious. Notably, a new entrant into the crypto world would know better than to share their seed phrase. It is part of the basic orientation given to all potential participants. For clarification, a seed phrase helps a participant recover access to a crypto wallet. This phrase is randomly generated in a unique sequence from the dictionary. It is a key to unlocking the user’s wallet and accessing the funds therein. Interestingly, subjecting the comment in the YouTube video to a forensic test confirmed it was a scam meant to lure. A key tell-tale indicator that gave it away was that the message was on several different videos, bearing the same phrase and request. How the Crypto Scam Steals Funds The scammer aims to get a potential “helper” to part with some funds. The trick is that the crypto wallet has been set up as a multi-signature wallet. The scammers assume that when someone has been lured to the wallet and sees the fund, they want to allocate it to their wallet instead of helping. However, given the setup of the wallet, a potential victim will see that the token fee is insufficient to make the transfer. When they transfer from their wallet to the “bait wallet,” it does not arrive, but channels to a third account, and the funds are transferred and lost. Experts Say Scam Targeting Greed and Ignorance Experts say this strategy could have been designed to target greedy users online seeking free lunch, only for them to end up as victims. It highlights the constant innovation by malicious actors in their quest to perpetrate fraud. They advise everyone to remain vigilant while in crypto and be cautious of any information or requests. This has become necessary as millions have been lost to scammers via various means.

38020233,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=666474,1734989418,Is Ethereum Ready To Break Out? Key Indicators Suggest Strong Market Confidence,"Ethereum (ETH) has remained a focal point in the cryptocurrency market, even as its price action continues to lag behind Bitcoin’s recent bullish trajectory. Despite failing to secure a new all-time high, Ethereum has shown multiple positive indicators that suggest a strong foundation for future growth. Analysts believe that these metrics reflect underlying market confidence, driven by both institutional and retail investors. Related Reading: 7.8M Ethereum Leaves Binance In Two Months—What Does This Mean for ETH? Key Market Indicators Highlight Ethereum Potential According to CryptoQuant analyst EgyHash, numerous factors are currently shaping the Ethereum market sentiment. Although Bitcoin has seen a stronger uptrend after the US elections, Ethereum’s technical indicators show both traders and long-term holders of the cryptocurrency are steadily accumulating it. All these are evident in Ethereum’s Estimated Leverage Ratio, funding charges, and regional trading premiums—all three of which are signs of Ethereum’s survivability in a downturn. EgyHash in a post on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform revealed that the Estimated Leverage Ratio for Ethereum currently remains at “elevated levels.” This ratio reflects the amount of leverage traders are taking on in derivatives markets relative to their holdings. A consistently high leverage ratio suggests a “sustained appetite for risk” among market participants, indicating confidence in Ethereum’s potential upward trajectory, EgyHash revealed. Ethereum’s Silent Surge: Key Metrics Turn Bullish “These factors point to a persistent bullish outlook for Ethereum, as market participants appear ready to maintain, and potentially increase, their exposure to the asset.” – By @EgyHashX Link 👇https://t.co/biIhFoyzBd pic.twitter.com/3kfghQ7EDX — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) December 23, 2024 . Funding Rates, Premiums, And Institutional Inflows Hint at Bullish Trend Additionally, funding rates for ETH derivatives remain moderately positive. Funding rates are periodic payments exchanged between long and short traders based on the price difference between the futures contract and the spot price. Positive funding rates suggest that long positions dominate the market, but without reaching overheated levels that could trigger large-scale liquidations. EgyHash wrote: This moderation suggests there is still room for a healthy price increase without an imminent risk of large-scale liquidations. Another noteworthy observation comes from the Korea Premium Index for ETH. This index measures the price gap between Ethereum trading on South Korean exchanges compared to global markets. A positive premium indicates heightened buying activity in the South Korean market. Historically, spikes in the Korea Premium Index have coincided with periods of strong upward momentum for Ethereum, suggesting that regional demand is playing a key role in supporting the asset’s price. EgyHash also mentioned that Ethereum’s appeal among institutional investors has remained strong, even through periods of market correction. Fund holdings for ETH have continued to rise steadily, signaling sustained confidence from institutional players who often take a long-term view on asset performance. These rising fund inflows suggest that institutional investors are accumulating ETH in anticipation of future price appreciation. Furthermore, retail traders and smaller investors have also contributed to Ethereum’s stability.

38020281,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=632488,1734988836,XRP dominates Binance’s altcoin market in December,"XRP was amongst the most traded altcoin on Binance this December according to CryptoQuant analyst JA Maartunn. The altcoin recorded a trading volume of more than $116.6 million on Binance Futures, outperforming other altcoins. As per Cryptoquant, XRP traded at higher volumes than other altcoins in the market for the entire month. This spike came at a time when the price of XRP was going up to its peak in three years before dropping sharply. “XRP is the most traded altcoin on the Binance Futures market, with a trading volume of 116.6B already, and the month isn’t over yet. It’s important to track the top-traded coins on Binance, as they should be your main focus when trading altcoins.” Maartun According to CoinGecko, XRP’s price has fallen to an intraday low of $2.18, a drop of more than 1%. XRP has also fallen by more than 25% since it reached a multi-year high on December 3. This price movement is similar to other major markets, as most of the top cryptocurrencies have been declining in the same period. Despite these setbacks, Maartum states that XRP remains resilient. He stated, “XRP seems to be recovering faster than most altcoins, despite broader market challenges.” According to CryptoQuant, the token’s open interest is at $1.90 billion, with Binance contributing nearly 50% of it. Wallet growth and investor interest in XRP Besides the price volatility, XRP has recorded an increase in the number of active wallets. According to the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the number of non-empty wallets for XRP has increased sharply. This growth, which started in October, is attributed to the improved understanding of XRP’s legal status. Since the U.S. SEC ruled in July 2023 that XRP is not a security, the token has witnessed incremental growth in the number of holders and the frequency of transactions as well. In the same month, Ripple submitted its Form C to present the arguments that Ripple wants to present in its cross-appeal. Over the last two years, the number of cryptocurrency investors has increased. XRP alone, for instance, has added an additional 5.75 million wallets, which is a 28% increase. This trend is in line with the increases in the top cryptocurrencies; Bitcoin has risen by 27%, Ethereum by 47%, and Tether by 66%. The price of XRP has also increased tremendously from the previous year, with a 253% annual change, showing more investors’ interest and trust.

In this week’s issue of the Protocol newsletter:  Trump’s crypto team  Aptos' leadership shake-up  TikTok meets tokens  Kraken scales up  This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Network News  TRUMP CRYPTO APPOINTMENTS: President-elect Donald Trump continues to make high-profile appointments embracing cryptocurrency and emerging technologies in his second term. 1) Stephen Miran, tapped as Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, is a pro-crypto advocate who aims to integrate blockchain and decentralized finance into the U.S. economy. 2) Bo Hines, a former college football player, will head the newly formed Crypto Council. Hines is tasked with balancing innovation and consumer protection as he builds a regulatory framework for digital assets. 3) David Sacks, a veteran of Silicon Valley and vocal blockchain supporter, is stepping in as AI and Crypto Czar. Sacks plans to merge blockchain with AI while bolstering U.S. dominance in both sectors. These appointments signal a clear shift from Trump’s earlier skepticism of digital assets. The big question now is how these moves translate into meaningful policy amid regulatory gridlock and political friction.  APTOS LEADERSHIP SHIFT: Aptos Labs CEO and co-founder Mo Shaikh has stepped down, with co-founder Avery Ching taking over as CEO. Shaikh, who will remain a strategic adviser, highlighted the company's achievements, including raising $400 million in venture funding and building a thriving ecosystem supported by partners like BlackRock, Google, Mastercard, and PayPal. Known for its layer-1 blockchain leveraging the Move programming language from Facebook's Diem project, Aptos Labs is expanding into finance and AI applications with the help of advisers like former Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein and OpenAI’s Kevin Weil. The leadership transition underscores the company’s ongoing focus on scalability, security, and innovation in blockchain technology.  SONIC TO AIRDROP TIKTOK: Sonic, a Layer 2 solution on the Solana blockchain, has announced plans to airdrop its native token, SONIC, to TikTok users. This initiative aims to introduce TikTok's vast user base to decentralized finance (DeFi) by integrating blockchain technology with social media platforms. The airdrop is part of Sonic's strategy to enhance user engagement and promote the adoption of Layer 2 solutions for improved scalability and reduced transaction costs on the Solana network. By targeting TikTok users, Sonic seeks to bridge the gap between mainstream social media audiences and the DeFi ecosystem, fostering broader participation in decentralized financial services.

Feature: Kraken’s Ink Layer-2 Goes Live  Kraken, the seventh-largest crypto exchange, said its layer-2 rollup network, built on top of the Ethereum blockchain, has gone live.  The network, called Ink, is based on the OP stack, a customizable framework that lets developers build their own rollups using Optimism’s technology. The team had originally planned for Ink to go live in early 2025, so the launch of its main network is ahead of schedule.  Kraken agreed to receive 25 million OP tokens (worth about $58 million) as part of a deal to build on the OP Stack. Optimism has acknowledged that handing out developer grants for participants building on the stack is part of its strategy, which in turn contributes back to the wider “Superchain” ecosystem.Kraken competitor Coinbase said in August 2023 that it would build a layer-2 network with OP Stack.  The product, called Base, is now the second-largest rollup network according to L2beat. At the time, Optimism said the Base team would receive up to 118 million OP tokens and, in return, would contribute the higher of 2.5% of its sequencer revenue or 15% of its profits to the Optimism Collective.

The investment reflects growing interest in Bitcoin-collateralized financial products as a bridge between traditional finance and digital assets.  Deals & Grants  Tether has announced a $75 million deal to acquire a stake in Rumble, a video-sharing platform. The investment aims to support decentralized media and aligns with Tether's commitment to fostering open communication technologies.  Data & Tokens  Bonk (BONK) surged 30%, leading a rebound among dog-themed meme tokens, with Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) also experiencing gains. Additionally, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) classified Floki (FLOKI) as a utility token, potentially influencing its regulatory status.  Data Corner: 60M USDC Outflows Hit Hyper Liquid  Hyper Liquid, a cryptocurrency exchange focused on perpetual contracts, has reported a record outflow of $60 million in USDC amid speculation that North Korea is investigating the platform. The sudden exodus of funds raises questions about the exchange’s liquidity and the stability of its operations. This highlights the growing tension of crypto markets with geopolitical issues, as regulatory scrutiny and potential misuse of platforms by state actors come into focus. The incident underscores the vulnerabilities in crypto markets, particularly for exchanges dealing with high-risk financial products like perpetual contracts. Hyper Liquid’s situation may prompt further scrutiny of similar platforms, emphasizing the need for stronger safeguards in the face of increasing global regulatory pressure.

Daddy Pepe (DADDPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 11,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DADDPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Daddy Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Daddy Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Daddy Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Daddy Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Daddy Pepe by entering its contract address – 9UFnMabUe7wecdEEzAYPoQPZiuTJ1hTFpNz6qtsiB3FA – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DADDPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | SHIB | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/daddy-pepe-daddpepe-solana-memecoin-will-rally-11000-ahead-of-exchange-listing-as-shib-wif-and-doge-underperform/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

XYZ: The new meme coin heavyweight The XYZ token is in the crypto ring, landing blows on the competition – hollow coins, flawed farming schemes, and scam projects.

BOME’s 5,000% takeoff and WIF’s 1,000% year-to-date rally could be relics of the past because XYZ is set to explode by over 9,900% from its current price by the TGE, potentially outshining its sensational predecessors. XYZVerse will be the MVP in this bull run, giving the community the control to call the plays and steer the ecosystem’s direction.

Interested investors can join the XYZ presale for the potential 9,900% gains. Shiba Inu Shiba Inu has seen significant price movements recently. Over the past week, its price dropped by 22.05%. In the last month, it decreased by 20.66%. However, over six months, SHIB’s price increased by 25.78%. This indicates that despite short-term declines, the coin has experienced growth in the longer term. The current price range of SHIB is between $0.00002396 and $0.00002800. The nearest resistance level is $0.00003514 and the nearest support level is $0.00002006. If the price rises toward the second resistance level at $0.00004418, it would represent a significant gain from current levels. On the other hand, dropping to the second support level of $0.00001202 would indicate a substantial decline. Technical indicators show mixed signals for SHIB. The Relative Strength Index is at 42.79, suggesting the coin is neither overbought nor oversold. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $0.00002174 and the 100-day average is $0.00002244, indicating a relatively stable trend. The MACD level is slightly negative, which may point to bearish momentum. Overall, SHIB’s price could move in either direction based on market conditions. Pepe Over the past week, Pepe has experienced a price drop of 24.05%, settling within a range of $0.00001600 to $0.00002445. In the past month, the coin decreased by 18.81%. However, looking at the six-month timeline, PEPE has still gained 56.35%, showing significant growth over the longer term. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 49.30, indicating a neutral market sentiment. The Stochastic oscillator is at 60.19, suggesting potential upward momentum. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) level is 0.0000000454, which could hint at a bullish shift. The 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages are close, at $0.00001781 and $0.00001796 respectively, pointing to a possible consolidation phase. PEPE faces immediate resistance at $0.00003144. Breaking above this level could lead to the next resistance at $0.00003817, potentially resulting in gains of around 15% to 37%. On the downside, the nearest support is at $0.00001498, with a secondary support at $0.00001125. Falling below these points might lead to declines of approximately 10% to 46%. Traders are watching these levels to assess whether PEPE will continue its upward trajectory or face further corrections. Conclusion SHIB and PEPE are notable, but XYZ blends memes and sports, seeking to unite fans in a community-driven ecosystem aiming for 20,000% growth and long-term success.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. TRX, SHIB, and CATZILLA vie for the best gains next quarter. Table of Contents Catzilla: A meme coin with purpose TRON: Empowering content creators Shiba Inu: Growing utility Conclusion In the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, three digital assets are capturing attention: Tron (TRX), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and the fresh newcomer, Catzilla (CATZILLA. With the potential for significant gains in the upcoming quarter, investors are keen to discover which one might outperform the others. Catzilla: A meme coin with purpose Catzilla doesn’t just ride the meme coin wave — it challenges the status quo. With its bold mission, Catzilla seeks to take on manipulators, scammers, and greed-driven players in the crypto space. As a symbol of transparency and empowerment, this meme coin will blend innovation, community, and financial growth in one ambitious package. Catzilla’s presale offers one of the best opportunities in the market, starting at $0.0002 and climbing to $0.0016 across 14 stages — with an 88% discount for early adopters. Investors eyeing high ROI will find its structured tokenomics both appealing and sustainable, with a projected 700% ROI during the presale alone. Catzilla’s utility features: Governance – Shape the future of CATZILLA through community voting and decision-making. Incentives – Be rewarded for active participation and support. Staking – Earn passive income by holding and staking CATZILLA tokens. Unlike many short-lived projects, Catzilla prioritizes creating lasting value for its community.

Whether a seasoned crypto enthusiast or new to the scene, Catzilla could provide a transparent, dynamic, and transformative journey toward financial freedom. Interested investors can seize the moment and join the CATZILLA revolution. You might also like: Why SHIB Holders are eyeing Catzilla’s 15,000% growth potential TRON: Empowering content creators TRON is a decentralized blockchain platform launched in 2017 by the Tron Foundation. It aims to give digital content creators full ownership rights and better rewards by connecting them directly with consumers without intermediaries like YouTube or Apple. TRON supports smart contracts and decentralized applications, making it a tool for developers to create dApps and an alternative to Ethereum. Its transaction model is similar to Bitcoin’s UTXO system, allowing transparent operations on a public ledger. By enabling anyone to create and share content without worrying about transaction fees, TRON has potential in fostering a decentralized internet. In the current market cycle, TRX’s focus on empowering creators highlights its potential in the blockchain space. Shiba Inu: Growing utility Shiba Inu is a meme-inspired cryptocurrency that runs on the Ethereum blockchain. Half of the original quadrillion SHIB token supply was sent to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, who donated some to charity and burned a large portion. Shiba Inu’s integration with Ethereum allows for dApps like ShibaSwap, its decentralized exchange, with plans for an NFT platform and a DAO-based governance system. This integration enhances SHIB’s potential utility in the crypto space. In the current market cycle, SHIB’s Ethereum-based features and growing ecosystem may make it an attractive option for those interested in meme coins with additional functionality. Conclusion TRX and SHIB may show less short-term potential, while Catzilla stands out with a projected 700% ROI during its presale, starting at $0.0002 and rising to $0.0016 over 14 stages. With governance features, rewarding incentives, and staking options, Catzilla seeks to unite crypto enthusiasts, inviting participation in the battle against crypto villains.

38019288,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=313870,1734987630,"Bitcoin Flashing Bullish Pattern That Led to 100% Rally Earlier This Year, According to Analyst Justin Bennett","A closely followed crypto strategist says Bitcoin ( BTC ) is forming a bullish pattern similar to what was witnessed earlier this year before sparking massive surges. Analyst Justin Bennett tells his 115,700 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin formed an ascending channel on the daily chart in Q1 of this year when BTC was trading at around $36,000. An ascending channel is typically viewed as a bullish pattern as it suggests that an asset is printing higher highs and higher lows. According to Bennett’s chart, Bitcoin briefly traded below the pattern’s diagonal support in February before igniting a 2x rally in just a few months. “We’ve seen BTC channels like this before, like this one in Dec-Jan of last year, right before Bitcoin doubled in price. I doubt this time is different.” Source: Justin Bennett/X Bennett says that Bitcoin is flashing a similar pattern now and that BTC may be able to ignite renewed rallies if it reclaims the $100,000 price area as support. “Although I think dips are for buying (spot), the highest conviction perpetual long will materialize on a reclaim (daily chart+) of the area between $99,000 and $102,000. Do that, and $110,000 and $120,000 are next in 2025 in my opinion.” Source: Justin Bennett/X Based on the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that BTC bulls need to defend support at $95,700 for Bitcoin “to remain constructive.” At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $95,889.

38019617,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=632490,1734987628,AI agents rallied the most among the first batches of Binance Alpha tokens,"Binance Alpha has already announced 29 tokens in its curation program for Web3 wallet users. The biggest earners in that selection were AI agent tokens. After a faulty start where a fake list was announced, some of the tokens jump-started their trading based on renewed hype. Since the token launch, 17 assets went higher and 12 sank lower with the rest of the market. The biggest gains were available to obscure tokens that gained exposure through the daily spotlight. Binance Alpha tokens are already a class of their own, with a total valuation of $3.22B . Binance Alpha launched at a time when the crypto market had already slid from its all-time highs. Most of the meme tokens and altcoins were also going through drawdowns. At that time, Binance introduced the Quick Buy button, boosting the exposure of up to five new tokens each day. Binance Alpha tests multiple token tracks Binance Alpha stated it has rigorous criteria for its token selection. However, the tool has spread to several token categories, checking which ones would perform. The tokens were divided among AI agents, animal memes, older DeFi tokens, DeSci, DAO, and AI infrastructure. The selection tracks some of the hottest narratives in 2024. The Binance Alpha tokens were taken from Ethereum, Solana, and Base, where most Ethereum tokens were DeFi assets, while the AI agents were deployed on Solana or Base. The selection included seven Solana tokens, 10 tokens on Binance Smart Chain, three on Base, and nine on Ethereum. The selection of Binance Alpha included a large range of valuations, starting from $10M market capitalization and up to $1B for more established tokens. The strongest gains came from early-stage tokens with relatively small valuations. Binance Alpha also finally picked Wise Monkey (MONKY), which was also part of the initial fake token list. Unfortunately, MONKY slid since the promotion, erasing more than 12% of its value to trade at $0.000015. The token tool also selected Rifampici (RIF) and Urolithin (URO), which have attempted to become prominent DeSci tokens. Binance has expressed interest in DeSci, but its focus is not enough to make the tokens rally. RIF and URO ended up with smaller losses compared to other tokens. AI agents are among the most common Binance Alpha selections AI agents on Binance Alpha included ChainGPT, AI Cell, FARTCOIN, AI16Z, Griffain, AIXBT by Virtuals and Luna by Virtuals, ZEREBRO, and Cookie DAO (COOKIE) in the last batch of tokens. Most of the AI tokens have gone beyond their early stage, and have other factors driving their price. After being added to Binance Alpha, FARTCOIN actually lost ground, sinking to a low of $0.55. The selection by Binance coincides with a slight recovery of the entire AI agent market, to a total market capitalization above $8.11B. Some of the smaller or forgotten AI agent tokens lined up among the biggest gainers. Those included Shoggoth, FROG, BOB, TERMINUS, and Numogram (GNON). The biggest losses came to APX (-28.12%) and GRIFFAIN (-25.41%). DeFi offers among the top gainers DeFi tokens were among the steadiest gainers based on the Binance Alpha selection. ODOS was the leader, a widely used DEX on the Base chain, with a gain of over 65%. MGP and GEAR gained around 30% on average, due to their lover valuation of $100M and $140M, respectively. Binance’s selection included DeFi tokens valued at different price ranges, starting at under $50M FDV, several selections under $200M, and two top tokens valued in the $300M-$500M range. Binance Alpha focuses on those relatively new tokens at a time when altcoin hype is already diminished. The Altcoin season index fell back to 53 points, with BTC outperforming most established tokens.

38019317,https://nulltx.com/?p=136259,1734987623,BDAG to Ignite San Siro – Surging Prospects for ETC & Polkadot,"BlockDAG to Energize the San Siro Stadium – A Closer Look at Ethereum Classic & Polkadot’s Rising Potential What makes certain cryptocurrencies stand out? Is it robust fundamentals, vibrant communities, or high-profile partnerships? Kicking off, Ethereum Classic (ETC) has recently seen a promising uplift in its price forecast, with market experts suggesting a potential 20% surge if it can hold above $28.50. Similarly, Polkadot is on the verge of breakthroughs with its ambitious 2.0 upgrades, enhancing scalability and flexibility, and bridging Web3 with traditional financial systems through stablecoin payment integrations. Yet, even these exciting developments may be overshadowed by BlockDAG (BDAG), which melds pioneering DAG-based technology with a booming presale that’s closing in on a stunning $171.5 million. BlockDAG’s partnership with Inter Milan is set to catapult it into the global spotlight through intensive fan engagement, prominent on-site branding, and trailblazing digital innovations, paving the way for enduring growth. BlockDAG’s Inter Milan Deal: A Growth Catalyst The launch of BlockDAG’s partnership with Inter Milan does more than just put its name out there—it significantly ramps up the value of BDAG coins. By connecting with the massive audience of one of Europe’s elite football clubs, BlockDAG is granted an extraordinary platform to millions of fans, promoting its cutting-edge technology and fueling widespread adoption. Initiatives focused on fan engagement, such as unique branding and merchandise offerings, forge new revenue pathways that enrich the BDAG ecosystem and anchor value for long-term stakeholders. This surge in value dovetails with instances where strategic partnerships have propelled token growth. Take, for instance, the way major sports collaborations have historically spiked user involvement and led to notable price increases. BlockDAG’s strategy mirrors this trend, securing a spot in the lucrative sports market. The overwhelming success of its presale, amassing over $171.5 million, underscores the fervent demand, positioning early buyers for potential exponential gains as adoption escalates. The presale’s tiered incentives, like the BDAG250 bonus, enhance this opportunity. Early adopters not only get tokens at a discount but also stand to gain from significant milestones, including its state-of-the-art blockchain technology. BDAG coins offer a unique mix of growth potential and practical utility, distinguishing them from other top crypto assets. With the Inter Milan partnership now active and achievements like the X1 Miner App fortifying the ecosystem, BDAG holders find themselves in a prime position to leverage the expanding adoption and integration, turning today’s holding into tomorrow’s fortune. Will Ethereum Classic (ETC) Maintain Its Upward Trajectory? Ethereum Classic (ETC) has recently grabbed headlines with a potential for a 20% rise, if it manages to stay above $28.50, driven by a decrease in exchange inflows indicating accumulation by dedicated investors. Supporting this optimistic forecast are strong technical indicators, such as an improving Relative Strength Index (RSI). However, ETC’s modest ecosystem evolution and sparse updates raise doubts about its long-term growth capabilities, especially in a fiercely competitive arena. In contrast to newer ventures, ETC’s appeal lies in its foundational status as the original Ethereum blockchain, and its commitment to Proof of Work continues to attract miners. Yet, its technological advancements are not keeping pace with other blockchain innovators. For traders looking for enduring profits, ETC’s potential for growth may seem constrained, highlighting the necessity to diversify into assets with advanced scalability and real-world applicability. Exploring Polkadot’s Escalating Potential Polkadot’s potential has significantly escalated with its latest 2.0 updates, marking a pivotal shift in its architecture. The introduction of Agile Coretime and modular setups empowers developers to lease computational power, boosting adaptability and scalability for various blockchain applications. Strategic alliances, such as the integration with Harbour’s stablecoin payment system, underline Polkadot’s expanding applications in linking Web3 with traditional financial sectors, establishing it as a crucial player in the evolving blockchain landscape. Despite these advancements, Polkadot’s market traction has been sluggish, with analysts pinpointing $10.88 as a crucial resistance level. Nevertheless, with a recent breakout from a falling wedge and ongoing technical enhancements, confidence in its market prospects is solidifying. For long-term investors, Polkadot offers robust fundamentals with a substantial growth trajectory as its adoption expands, positioning it as a network to keep an eye on among the next-gen blockchain projects. Summing Up Both Ethereum Classic (ETC) and Polkadot present windows for rapid gains, yet their prolonged growth depends on continual ecosystem advancements. While ETC shows potential for a notable 20% increase, and Polkadot’s updates suggest significant scalability improvements, they face stiff competition in the marketplace. In contrast, BlockDAG stands apart among premier crypto assets, with its value deeply rooted in real-world adoption. The activation of its partnership with Inter Milan at San Siro Stadium not only promises global acclaim but also drives robust demand for BDAG coins. Alongside its innovative technology and significant presale milestones, BlockDAG is perfectly positioned for sustained growth.

38019473,https://blockworks.co/news/trump-appoints-crypto-council-head,1734987600,Trump crypto appointment spurs optimism,"This is a segment from the Forward Guidance newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . President-elect Donald Trump appears to be working down his crypto promises list via another personnel decision. Trump said Sunday that Bo Hines will serve as executive director of the Presidential Council of Advisers for Digital Assets. David Sacks, the PayPal co-founder who Trump tapped to be the US government’s AI and crypto czar earlier this month, will chair this group. Hines will work with Sacks “to foster innovation and growth in the digital assets space, while ensuring industry leaders have the resources they need to succeed,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Together, they will create an environment where this industry can flourish, and remain a cornerstone of our nation’s technological advancement,” he added. A former NC State (and Yale) football player, Hines sought to represent North Carolina’s 13th Congressional district in 2022, but lost that election to Democrat Wiley Nickel. He launched a campaign in December 2023 to represent the state’s 6th Congressional district — endorsing Trump that same month before posting this to X in January: Cryptocurrency is the epitome of individual empowerment in finance. We don’t need the government stepping in and slapping burdensome regulations on financial innovation. This new sector needs the freedom to grow organically. Decentralized finance is the way of the future if… — Bo Hines (@BoHines) January 16, 2024 Trump had referenced a US crypto council in July during his address at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville. He said it was something he would assemble “immediately” before asking for a show of hands who wanted to be on it. The crowd roared. The then-presidential candidate said the council’s task of designing crypto regulatory guidance would get done in 100 days. We’ll have to monitor that. Reuters reported last month that people at crypto companies Ripple, Kraken, Circle, Paradigm and a16z were among those wanting a seat at that table. Trump’s ongoing engagement with the industry seems to show his pro-crypto rhetoric was not just lip service. A few days before that Reuters story ran, Trump nominated crypto-friendly Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick to lead the Department of Commerce. The soon-to-be president also just met with Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek last week about crypto-related appointments and a bitcoin reserve. Those congratulating Hines on X yesterday included crypto bigwigs Michael Saylor and Fred Thiel — leaders of two companies (MicroStrategy and Marathon Digital) which own roughly 490,000 BTC combined.

Nevertheless, innovative solutions that can destabilize conventional approaches appear periodically. One such project is DTX Exchange, a trading platform that can overtake these giants in terms of usage, utility, and market shares. DTX Exchange is a profitable altcoin with innovative technology and a vibrant community that is driving its adoption within a short period. DTX Exchange (DTX): The Altcoin Set To Outshine XRP ETF DTX Exchange (DTX) is among those creating a new concept of financial markets that include essential aspects of both the centralized (CEX) and decentralized (DEX) exchanges. Such a Layer-1 blockchain solution not only connects TradFi and DeFi but also offers trading solutions that can suit the level of any trader, from novice to experienced. DTX provides traders with more than 120,000 financial instruments to trade from, such as shares, exchange-traded funds, bonds, forex, and cryptocurrencies. Equipped with a patented dual-horizon blockchain running on both Ethereum and Solana, DTX will revolutionize trading around the world and bring more people to the markets. With similar launches, many have a large portion of the presale bought out by large VCs. This isn’t the case with DTX Exchange, as they have a democratic structure in place. Using DTX tokens, users have a direct way to drive the direction of the platform through voting. DTX just recently achieved the $10,000,000 milestone , with early backers earning over 600% ROI on their investment. At a price of $0.12, the sixth presale stage is near sell out. With an exciting CoinMarketCap listing, DTX Exchange is one of the fastest growing altcoin presales today. Cardano Price: ADA Down 17% This Week Cardano (ADA) has an outstanding and stable ecosystem with a large focus on innovative product development. To retain its designation as a leading Layer-1 blockchain, ADA has just announced that it is tokenizing the mineral rights of the lithium industry in Argentina. Analysts claim that this will have a positive effect on the Cardano price, increasing transparency and streamlining trading. However, the Cardano price currently suffers from a broader bearish market. Down over 17% this week, ADA has retracted since its recent 200% rally. Some forecasts suggest that the Cardano price will rise up to $2 by the end of 2025. With a developing ecosystem and innovative technology, Cardano (ADA) is due for a recovery in the near future. Ripple and the XRP ETF: Institutional Adoption with Challenges The long-standing cryptocurrency Ripple’s XRP has always been considered as one of the driving forces of the crypto market together with leveraging the cross-border transactions. This is because the recent expansion of the XRP ETF can be realized as another token that goes a long way in realizing the gain of institutional interest in Ripple. Currently traded at $2.18, Ripple remains attractive to both retail and institutional investors. Following Gensler’s resignation announcement, investors got excited for the potential approval of the XRP ETF. Many analysts speculate that the XRP ETF is only a matter of time, with a positive price increase in Ripple to follow. One prediction placed that Ripple were to reach a new ATH if the XRP ETF were to be approved in 2025. Conclusion The arrival of the next cycle in the crypto market will see DTX Exchange (DTX) stand out as a pioneer. It has developed a hybrid trading model that is unbeatable, with outstanding growth prospects that cannot be matched anywhere else. Although the Cardano price is set for a recovery and Ripple’s XRP ETF is to be approved in 2025, they don’t offer the same room for growth.

38019127,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=313932,1734987307,Crypto Exchange Binance Announces Support for New ‘Decentralized Science’ Altcoin Project,"Binance, the top global crypto exchange by trading volume, is rolling out support for the new native token of a “decentralized science” project. Binance Launchpool, which lets users stake coins to farm new assets, says its 63rd project will be BIO Protocol (BIO), a decentralized platform aiming to advance biotechnology through collective funding and the tokenization of biotech projects. Says the project, “BIO is a curation and liquidity protocol for decentralized science (DeSci). Our mission is to accelerate biotechnology by giving global communities of patients, scientists and biotech professionals the ability to collectively fund, build and own tokenized biotech projects and intellectual property (IP). The team behind BIO helped create Molecule, a tokenization platform for early-stage biomedicine, and VitaDAO, the largest decentralized community for longevity science. Building on these successes, BIO is designed to catalyze an on-chain scientific economy through decentralized funding, incentives and liquidity. The BIO token gives holders access to BIO’s network of scientific communities and IP, enabling broad exposure to the DeSci economy.” Binance Launchpool plans to roll out support for BIO on Tuesday. Binance also says it will support BIO for spot trading starting January 3rd, 2025. BIO founder Paul Kohlhaas is celebrating the listing on the social media platform X. “Time to let liquid science flow. Thrilled to share Bio Protocol listing on Binance on Jan. 3. BIO is designed as a liquidity bridge from CeFi into DeSci – stay tuned for go-live of our liquidity engine. Thanks to all scientists, builders and supporters of Bio Protocol ecosystem.” Binance will attach a seed tag to BIO, which the exchange applies to lower-liquidity projects that may exhibit higher volatility compared to other listed tokens. Binance requires users who own assets with seed tags to pass quizzes every 90 days to ensure they’re aware of the risks before trading the tokens.

This Underrated Altcoin Could Be Next In Line After Listing,"The cryptocurrency space is experiencing massive changes, especially the ongoing correction, which has allowed investors to diversify their portfolios. After last week’s Fed meet, meme coins performed weakly. Most investors experienced FOMO due to Dogecoin's earlier vertical rally, but the downtrend clearly showed a huge shift in sentiment from meme coins to altcoins. DOGE price is trading 35% below the monthly high. The bull market is now favoring utility altcoins like DTX Exchange (DTX). Due to its innovative features and market stability, this token is poised for massive growth in 2025. In the sixth presale stage, it has raised $10.50 million and is priced at just $0.12. Will DOGE Price Reach The $1 Mark? The most discussed topic in the crypto market is whether DOGE price will reach $1, and the massive correction has again sparked discussion in the community. In this downtrend, DOGE price hit a low of $0.26; however, after this low, it formed a V-shaped reversal and is now trading at $0.316. In the last 24 hours. Dogecoin has decreased by 1.08% while its volume has decreased by 25%, showing lesser trading activity. Source: CoinMarketCap The 50 EMA support was also broken on Thursday, and the Dogecoin’s chart shows it is struggling to hold momentum above key levels. Further losses could push DOGE price toward the next support level at $0.266 if this support breaks. On the upside, the $0.37 level remains a major hurdle, as buyers consistently face challenges gaining traction there. From a broader perspective, this is possibly just a healthy correction rather than a long-term reversal. The DOGE price increased by 161.61% in November, followed by a 25% pullback in December. Analysts noted that the pullback could pave the way for growth next year; the traction of DOGE price might be slow from now on. On the other hand, Whale Alert reported that one major transaction got the attention as 200 million Dogecoin, worth $59,925,858, was transferred from an unknown wallet to the Binance exchange. DTX Exchange (DTX) Presale Stuns Market Experts With 200X Potential The significant correction in Dogecoin has made investors cautious about meme coins, helping potential altcoins like DTX Exchange (DTX) . Despite the ongoing market correction, DTX's presale has seen a massive inflow of over $2.3 million in the last two weeks, totaling $10.5 million. DTX’s advanced API interface and L-1 blockchain have attracted larger market players, as it holds the potential for 200X growth after its listing. DTX Exchange is leading the future transformation of traditional trading with its hybrid model. With this protocol, users will be able to access 120,000+ assets, such as cryptocurrency, forex, ETFs, CFDs, and stocks, on a single platform. By bridging the gap between DeFi and TradFi, this exchange allows traders to diversify portfolios. DTX Exchange also incorporates a non-custodial wallet that gives users complete authority. This wallet is specifically designed for traders, who can easily borrow cryptos at very low interest rates when they lack funds. It features multiple security layers to prevent any hiccups or thefts. Conclusion DTX Exchange is positioned to dominate the trading industry across multiple markets as it moves toward wide adoption and rapidly increases its user base. According to experts, DTX Exchange will be among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by mid-2025, outpacing large-cap coins like Dogecoin.

The current price hovers around the simple moving averages, indicating consolidation. With the nearest resistance level at $4502, a breakout above this point could see Ethereum climb over 30% from current levels. The MACD is positive, and the RSI is near neutral at 52.99, suggesting there's room for growth. If momentum builds, the second resistance level at $5508.88 is within reach, representing a potential gain of over 60%.

38019058,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=632398,1734986450,Nokia patents encryption system to tackle rising crypto asset vulnerabilities,"Mobile phone manufacturer Nokia has filed a patent for encrypting digital assets to increase their security. According to reports, the company applied to China’s National Intellectual Property Administration in June 2024. The abstract for the patent shows that the system will be capable of encrypting digital assets using a first key. With the process, digital assets will have another layer of protection via encryption, making the encrypted assets inaccessible to anyone who does not have the key. For instance, an encrypted Bitcoin or ETH will not be accessible by anyone except those with the private key to the assets. Thus, they will not be susceptible to hacking like regular crypto. The process extends to indexing the encrypted assets for identification and verification purposes and then providing the means of identification to the first entity. This means it could be possible to encrypt digital assets, use them for transactions, and only decrypt them after the transaction is confirmed. When successfully implemented, the proposed system could solve one of the significant challenges facing the crypto industry presently – the security vulnerability of digital assets. According to Chainalysis data, over $2.2 billion was lost to crypto hacks in 2024, demonstrating the need for a more robust security framework. Experts have noted that this year’s 21% rise in crypto hacks is due to the market boom. Still, this is the fourth consecutive year that crypto hacks will exceed $1 billion. Nokia is expanding its blockchain technology applications. Meanwhile, the new patent represents an entry into digital assets for Nokia, which has been building its tech stack focusing on innovative applications. As far back as 2021, the company launched the Data Marketplace for enterprises to share and trade data and AI models online. The Data Marketplace, powered by blockchain technology, is just one of several ways that Nokia has been building its technology portfolio. Since losing its dominance as a mobile phone maker, the company has been making giant strides in other areas, such as the Internet of Things, mobile communications, and 5G. While securing the patent does not guarantee that the company will eventually develop the system, getting approval for the patent proves the idea’s viability. Even if the company does not develop the idea, its patent could form the basis for further development and improvements in securing digital assets. Traditional firms developing technology for the crypto sector Nokia is just one of the several traditional companies that have been dabbling in creating technology for the crypto industry. While companies like Sony have been focusing on using existing blockchain technology, others are also developing technology for the sector. In 2021, Microsoft filed a patent for a human-powered crypto-mining system, and Apple also has patents that imply the potential use of blockchain technology. While these companies have yet to use any of these patents, one company that has been actively developing technology for the industry is payments giant Mastercard. This is unsurprising, given that Mastercard is one of the most active traditional participants in the industry. In late September, the company filed two patents for a system that will facilitate trustless payment transactions using smart contracts and a system for converting crypto to fiat . Mastercard already has several crypto-related applications within its ecosystem, and judging by the several other patents it holds for everything from blockchain ticketing to fraud detection technology, it has lofty goals in the sector. Meanwhile, Switzerland-based VPN and email service provider Proton recently launched a self-custody crypto wallet focused on privacy. The Proton Wallet is integrated into its ecosystem, allowing users to send Bitcoin using email addresses. It also rotates public addresses for each transaction, ensuring users’ privacy as it makes it impossible to track all transactions associated with a public address on-chain. Given the growing mainstream adoption of crypto, the growing interest from these traditional companies is unsurprising. With the industry enjoying more political support than ever on the back of a massive rally, the growth potential has made it attractive for many traditional institutions.

The game SonicX has already gained over 2 million users thanks to its smooth integration into the popular social media platform. Sonic has tapped into TikTok’s massive reach and engagement to bring blockchain gaming to the masses. This reward strategy aims to boost user interaction while deepening the connection between the game and the platform. Bridging Web2 and Web3: Sonic’s Innovative Approach Sonic recently launched its SonicX game directly on TikTok. This move aims to offer a seamless gaming experience without the usual barriers of blockchain gaming. User retention is one of the biggest challenges in the blockchain gaming world. This is mainly due to the often cumbersome experience of setting up wallets, connecting to platforms, and understanding blockchain concepts. By integrating the SonicX game directly into TikTok, Sonic bypasses these hurdles. It introduces blockchain gaming in a way that feels natural to users familiar with social media apps. For blockchain gaming to truly thrive, developers must ensure that the user experience is as smooth as traditional Web2 apps. Sonic’s partnership with TikTok demonstrates how Web2 platforms can be leveraged to bring Web3 experiences to the masses, significantly lowering the barrier to entry. The SONIC Token Airdrop: A Win for Users and Sonic To reward its growing user base, Sonic plans to airdrop SONIC tokens to players who joined the game through TikTok. This reward strategy is designed to keep users engaged while encouraging them to participate in the growing Sonic ecosystem. By offering free tokens, Sonic is incentivizing new players and building an in-game economy that can grow over time. The airdrop feels like a bonus for players, providing them with real value for their participation. Similarly, the founder of Amonica Brands, Yat Siu, recently l aunched a special two-stage MOCA token giveaway . This holiday gesture was to reward early supporters of the Moca Network. TikTok’s Power Play: 2 Million Users and Counting With over 1 billion monthly active users and projections to surpass 2.3 billion by 2029, TikTok is perfect for Sonic’s innovative approach. The platform’s large reach makes it an ideal choice for their strategy. SonicX has already seen massive traction and successfully onboarded over 2 million users through TikTok. This massive user base, combined with TikTok’s captivating algorithm, can potentially boost Sonic’s reach exponentially. The power of TikTok lies not only in its size but in its ability to create viral content and encourage user engagement. Despite controversy over misinformation , TikTok’s engaging, fast-paced environment has overshadowed the negative narrative. Its appeal continues to drive user growth and influence.

To read full editions, subscribe . President Biden over the weekend signed Congress’s bipartisan spending package, narrowly avoiding a government shutdown and keeping federal operations funded through mid-March. The bill, cut from 1,500 pages to around 100, does not raise the debt ceiling, a provision President-elect Trump requested. Also out: a 3.8% raise for members of Congress, a bipartisan provision included in the original bill. The eleventh-hour deal did little to calm markets, which have struggled to maintain their post-election momentum this month. The S&P 500 is down 1.7% since the start of December. The tech-heavy Nasdaq has fared better, gaining 1.4% month to date, but the index lost almost 3% last week alone. The dip, which Sevens Report Research founder Tom Essaye attributes to hawkish commentary from the Fed, political turmoil and disappointing initial jobless claims data last week, could be a “potential preview” for the new year . “Now, to be clear, while I say that, I’m also not saying I expect the market to decline next year,” Essaye added. “Instead, I think last week was a preview of 2025 because it was a realization of what I have been warning about: Namely that uncertainty around the key drivers of this bull market is going to rise and we saw that last week with two of the drivers of rally, expectations for Fed rate cuts and pro-growth policies.” The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were trading fairly flat midway through Monday’s session, up 0.6% and 1%, respectively, as of 2:15 pm ET. Market moves are expected to be relatively soft this week with a limited number of trading days. Meanwhile, bitcoin has also stalled. The largest digital currency is down around 13% from its all-time high of more than $108,000. Historically, cryptos deliver mixed returns in the final days of the year. When trying to predict what might happen this week, analysts say keeping an eye on macro conditions will be key. “While reduced liquidity can heighten volatility, the absence of major institutional activity may actually stabilize prices,” James Toledano, chief operating officer at Unity Wallet, said. “This year, much depends on investor sentiment following 2024’s ETF approval and the Trump-factor as well as other macro trends.” Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

Here’s a simple guide to help you use a bot for copy-trading the most profitable crypto wallets. Hopefully you’ll find it helpful. Introduction Looking to copy profitable trades without spending hours researching new tokens? Check out Definest—a platform designed to help you easily find and copy-trade winning wallets. With over 50 filters—such as PnL, Win Rate, and ROI—it’s never been easier to zero in on traders, snipers, and investors who consistently deliver strong returns. Step 1: Open the Wallets Page on Definest.ai Definest gives you visibility into every Ethereum-based wallet (with Solana support coming soon) and lets you explore over 20 metrics that gauge trading performance—including PnL, ROI, and Win Rate (shown in the top row). It also provides hypothetical metrics—PnL, ROI, and Win Rate if you had copied that wallet’s trades (shown in the bottom row)—so you can evaluate the wallet’s potential before you start copy-trading it. Step 2: Creating a Wallet Filter Definest gives you 26 filters for the “original” wallet and another 26 for the “following” (copied) wallet. Let’s set up a new filter. To do this, click Wallet filter -> Add filter . Example filter for finding winning sniper wallets: Median Coin Lifetime (6 months): max 2 minutes Total Trades (3 months): min 6 Total Trades (1 month): min 1 Scam Trades (1 year): max 20% ROI Total (1 year): min 300% ROI Total (3 months): min 150% ROI Total (1 month): min 50% F. ROI Total (1 year): min 270% F. ROI Total (3 months): min 130% F. ROI Total (1 month): min 30% F. PnL Total (1 year): min $10,000 Note: “F. ROI Total” (Following ROI Total) represents the projected ROI if you were to copy-trade that particular wallet. Keep in mind, not all filters are available in the free version. You’ll need a Premium subscription to unlock them all. That said, it’s still possible to find profitable wallets using the free version—it might just take a bit longer. Click Save and Apply . Out of 4.3 million wallets, just 33 meet these criteria. Step 3: Review the Wallet Page Open any selected wallet, and you’ll see all of its metrics—PnL, ROI, Win Rate, and more—across different timeframes. You’ll also see profit charts: The green line represents the original wallet’s PnL. The blue line represents the projected PnL if you had been following this wallet. Below that, you’ll find all the wallet’s trades. You can expand any trade to see its full breakdown—every buy and sell involved. When calculating profits, all costs are considered: network fees, token fees, router fees, and even bribes to block producers. Step 4: Start Copy-Trading with the Definest Bot Go to the Copy-Trading Bot tab on Definest.ai and click Add Trading Bot + . Create a new wallet and make sure to save the wallet’s keys. Step 5: Customize Your Copy-Trading Settings Buy settings: Wallet address: Enter the address of the wallet you want to copy trades from. Copy Buy: Turn this on to automatically replicate the wallet’s buy orders. Anti-MEV: Enable this to protect your buys from MEV bot interference. Retry times: Set to 10—this is how many times the bot will retry if an error occurs. Buy percentage: Choose what percentage of the original wallet’s trades you want to mirror. First buy amount: Specify minimum and maximum amounts for your initial buy. Copy Gas: Turn this on to use the same gas settings as the original wallet. Gas Delta: Add a gas premium here, if needed. Slippage: Set your slippage tolerance (at least 20%). Approval settings: Auto approve: Enable this so the bot can sell tokens. Retry times: Set to 3. Gas Delta: 1. Sell settings: Copy sell: Turn this on to replicate the original wallet’s sell orders. Auto sell: Enable this so the bot can sell at Stop-Loss, Take-Profit, or Time-Fix triggers. Anti-MEV: Turn this on to protect your sells from MEV bots. Retry times: Set to 10—this is how many times the bot will retry if an error occurs. Copy Gas: Enable this to use the same gas settings as the original wallet. Gas Delta: Add a gas premium if needed. Take-profit: Set one or more take-profit targets to automatically sell once a certain ROI percentage is reached. Stop-loss: Set one or more stop-loss levels to automatically limit potential losses. Conclusion By following this guide, you’ll be able to effectively pinpoint and copy-trade profitable crypto wallets. Always do thorough research and testing before making any investment decisions. Tips for Success Diversify: Don’t put all your funds in one basket. Follow multiple successful traders to spread out your risk. Regular Monitoring: Keep a close eye on your portfolio’s performance and adjust your strategies based on the results.

38018378,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/?p=27001,1734985284,"Analog Launches Mainnet, Opening New Horizons for Multi-Chain dApps","Analog , an innovator that has been leading when it comes to blockchain interoperability, has recently launched its mainnet setting a new benchmark for multi-chain technology. The platform, which will go live today, December 23, 2024, will work to empower developers to create next-generation decentralized applications (dApps) that will be capable of operating across several blockchain ecosystems. According to Analog, the initial rollout will feature a Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus mechanism which will provide a solid foundation for the upcoming advancements in the space. The launch will go on and build on the successes of Analog’s capabilities as showcased on the testnet. Looking at the figures, the platform was able to amass more than 345,000 accounts as well as generate 1.9 million cross-chain datasets. As one would expect, having such figures would cement Analog’s reputation as a leader and that is exactly what it has done, with over 50 different projects already being committed to building on its ecosystem proving the same. At its core, Analog’s mainnet will serve as a powerful interoperability hub that has been designed to smoothen the creation of cross-chain applications. As such, the developers will be in a position to make use of the tools that are available to build applications that respond to events occurring across multiple chains in real time. So, while the current PoA setup lays the groundwork, Analog has plans to integrate other features such as the Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS) consensus, advanced cross-chain messaging, and dynamic data querying which will gradually roll out, culminating in full implementation by the Token Generation Event (TGE). The transition to mainnet saw Analog being put under an extensive three-phase testnet to optimize its functionalities. And, it is noteworthy to mention that the results were nothing short of impressive since they generated significant engagement, which includes 12 million website visits and the creation of over 290,000 smart contracts. It doesn’t end there since the Proof of Humanity (PoH) verification process authenticated over 42,000 real users who will be there to ensure that the mainnet has a community that is ready to engage with the mainnet right from day one. As of today, the ecosystem already boasts an array of projects that are already leveraging Analog’s technology. For instance, StationX has employed Analog’s automation workflows to revolutionize multi-chain DAO operations. A move that simplifies tasks such as fund distribution and event-triggered actions; Parami Protocol uses Analog to enable decentralized AI agents to connect with communities across different chains; Frax Finance uses Analog for real-time Oracle data and multi-chain governance to enhance the stability of its stablecoin ecosystem; XYO takes advantage of Analog’s cross-chain tools to offer seamless access to blockchain-powered location data and Vemo Network as well, which utilizes Analog to transform locked assets into tradable NFTs that represent cross-chain value. When it comes to the developer ecosystem, Analog has itself bolstered by a comprehensive toolkit which includes Analog watch – a cross-chain data indexing platform akin to The Graph but tailored for multi-chain environments. By having such tools at one’s disposal, the development process becomes much simpler for the developers as they will be able to focus on innovation as Analog handles the interoperability bit of it. In conclusion, Analog is redefining interoperability by providing a framework for dApps to operate across blockchains. Doing so positions it as a key enabler of the decentralized future while paving the way for a new era of innovation in the multi-chain space and blockchain as a whole.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | TECHNOLOGY,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/analog-launches-mainnet-opening-new-horizons-for-multi-chain-dapps/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Grab the Best New Meme Coin Presale at 50% Off Before It’s Gone Forever!,"Missed the Bonk Coin boom? You’re not alone. In its early days, BONK turned early adopters into overnight millionaires, leaving the rest to regret sitting on the sidelines. With its meteoric rise on the Solana blockchain, it cemented itself as a pioneer in the meme coin world. But here’s the good news—2025 is offering a second chance, and it’s called BTFD Coin (BTFD) . Since launching its presale, BTFD Coin has raised over $4.38 million, selling more than 58 billion coins to over 6,400 holders. Currently in its 12th stage, BTFD is flaunting a festive rollback price of $0.000064, mirroring Stage 7. With features like a beta P2E game, staking at 90% APY, and a referral programme, BTFD is set to become the Best New Meme Coin Presale of 2025. Don’t let this chance slip away—seize the dip before January 5th and lock in life-changing returns! BTFD Coin (BTFD): The Bulls’ Best New Meme Coin Presale Move over, Bonk—there’s a new bull in town, and it’s charging straight into the hearts of crypto enthusiasts. BTFD Coin isn’t just another meme coin; it’s a full-blown movement for investors who know how to turn market dips into golden opportunities. With its presale already raising over $4.38 million and more than 58 billion coins sold, BTFD is the talk of the crypto town. Why BTFD Stands Out At its core, BTFD celebrates the timeless strategy of buying the dip. Built on Ethereum’s robust and scalable blockchain, BTFD combines community-driven momentum with cutting-edge utilities, such as its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, 90% APY staking rewards, and a lucrative referral programme. The presale, currently in its 12th stage, offers an exclusive 50% discount with the code “BIG50,” allowing investors to snag coins at the Stage 7 price of just $0.000064. Features That Make BTFD Unmissable Play-to-Earn Game: BTFD’s P2E game beta launched in Stage 10 of the presale, introducing an interactive way to earn rewards and engage with the ecosystem. While the beta doesn’t offer rewards yet, the full game promises to be a game-changer, driving both adoption and value. High APY Staking: Launched on December 2, BTFD’s staking programme offers a whopping 90% APY, making it one of the most rewarding staking setups in the meme coin arena. Referral Programme: Earn 10% of the raised amount in BTFD tokens by sharing your unique referral code. The top 20 referrers get additional bonuses, adding a competitive edge to the programme. The Bulls Squad: A community-driven initiative that embodies resilience and camaraderie, fostering a sense of belonging and shared purpose among holders. Investment Potential: From Dip to Moonshot Imagine this: You invest $5,000 at the current presale price of $0.000064. Once BTFD lists at $0.0006 post-presale, your investment balloons to $46,875. That’s an ROI of 837.5%. These numbers aren’t just speculative; they’re based on BTFD’s meticulously planned presale structure and upcoming listings. How to Buy BTFD Coin Getting in on the action is simple: Go to the BTFD Presale Page . Connect Your Wallet: Choose MetaMask, Trust Wallet, or another compatible wallet. Enter the Bonus Code: Use “BIG50” in the bonus code field and click “Apply.” Enter Purchase Details: Specify the amount of BTFD you want to buy and review the discounted price.

The Phenomenon of Bonk (BONK): A Missed Goldmine Bonk (BONK) made headlines in late 2022 as the first-ever Solana-based meme coin to take the market by storm. It rode the meme frenzy, breathing life back into Solana’s ecosystem during a tough market period. The Bonk community ignited a wildfire of excitement, with analysts and influencers alike hailing it as the “Doge of Solana.” During its early days, BONK’s price skyrocketed from a mere fraction of a cent, creating astronomical returns for early adopters. Whales and retail investors alike saw their portfolios multiply, all thanks to the hype and community-driven marketing. But as the hype cooled, many who missed the initial wave were left kicking themselves, wishing for another chance. Fast forward to today, and Bonk has matured. While it remains a pivotal player in the meme coin space, its days of 10,000% gains may be behind us. If you’re looking for Bonk-like returns, you’ll need to catch lightning in a bottle once again. Enter BTFD Coin, the presale powerhouse that’s already smashing milestones and setting the stage for 2025’s next meme coin revolution. Why 2025 Could Mirror 1973’s Legendary Comebacks The 1973–74 financial crisis was a chaotic storm of collapsing systems and surging inflation, yet it paved the way for some of the greatest investment stories ever told. While most investors panicked, legends like Warren Buffett turned the chaos into opportunities, scooping up undervalued assets and holding for long-term gains. The same principles apply to today’s crypto market. With meme coins leading the charge, every dip presents a chance to buy low and reap exponential rewards. BTFD embodies this mindset, offering a rare opportunity to join a presale at rock-bottom prices. Don’t Let BTFD Become Your Next “What If” Bonk’s story was thrilling, but it’s already been written. BTFD Coin is where the next chapter begins. With its stellar features, unbeatable presale pricing, and a community geared for success, BTFD isn’t just the Best New Meme Coin Presale—it’s your ticket to 2025’s crypto riches. Don’t wait.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD losing 1.2% on the day, extending its downtrend. Over the weekend, Bitcoin briefly spiked to $99,500 before being pushed down by sellers, bringing its drawdown from last week’s all-time highs to 15%. Short-term price performance has raised concerns among analysts. The popular X analytics account Bitcoindata21 highlighted bearish signals, noting, “Underside retests and rejections of VWAPs are NOT what you want to see for bullish price action.” Their analysis pointed to a likely retest of $92,000, with a more significant buying opportunity at $85,000–$86,000, described as the “back up the truck” zone for bulls. Similarly, the trader CrypNuevo predicted further price drops before a market rebound, targeting levels near $90,000. “Now, I still think that we could revisit the lows,” CrypNuevo shared in a thread on X, discussing low-timeframe market patterns. “It’s hard to imagine that we’re going to get a V shape recovery from here. I’m leaning more towards either a W formation or a 100% of the wick fill. Ideally, the 100% wick-fill, since $90k is a strong psychological level.” Bitcoin’s recent volatility has left market participants questioning the strength of the asset’s support levels, as bearish momentum continues to dominate short-term trends.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/bitcoin-dips-below-94k-as-analysts-predict-further-drops-to-85k/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Over the past few days, the overall cryptocurrency market has faced downside momentum. XRP Current Outlook Despite this, XRP has held its crucial support level at the $2.15 mark for the last five trading days. Meanwhile, major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Dogecoin (DOGE), have experienced a notable price decline during the same period. The potential reason behind XRP’s ability to maintain its support level is the continuous support and confidence from investors and traders, as reported by on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . $407 Million Worth XRP Outflow Data from XRP spot inflow/outflow revealed that exchanges across the cryptocurrency landscape had witnessed an outflow of a significant $407 million worth of XRP in the past six days. During this period, exchanges didn’t face any inflow or token deposits from wallet addresses, which hints at a bullish sign. Source: Coinglass In the cryptocurrency landscape, “outflow” refers to the movement of assets from exchanges to wallets, which also represents accumulation. However, this significant outflow indicates potential upside momentum and an ideal buying opportunity. There is a high possibility it could create buying pressure if this trend continues. Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels According to expert technical analysis, XRP is at a crucial support level of $2.15 and appears to be losing its grip on that support. Source: Trading View Based on recent price action and historical momentum, if the altcoin closes a daily candle below the $2.15 level, there is a strong possibility it could decline by 15% to reach the next support level at the $1.95 mark. Conversely, if XRP holds this level, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 25% to reach the $2.75 mark in the future. Current Price Momentum At present, XRP is trading near $2.20 and has experienced a price decline of over 1.05% in the past 24 hours.

38018027,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=375765,1734984671,Trump Names Bo Hines Executive Director of Presidential Digital Asset Advisory Committee,"U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has appointed former college football player Bo Hines to the new crypto council. Announced Sunday, Hines will be onboard as the executive director of the Presidential Council of Advisers for Digital Assets. Trump’s Crypto Council The 29-year-old acknowledged the appointment in a December 23 post on X, writing: “Thank you, Mr. President! It will be the honor of a lifetime to serve in your next administration. Thank you for everything you have done and continue to do for our country.” Hines further expressed his excitement about collaborating with the council’s chair, David Sacks. He also stated his commitment to ensuring that the digital asset industry thrives and remains central to the United States’ technological leadership. According to a Truth Social post by Trump, the crypto council is a newly created advisory body composed of key figures in the virtual currency space. Chaired by Sacks, the group will work to foster innovation and growth in the sector while providing industry leaders with the resources they need to succeed. “Together, they will create an environment where this industry can flourish and remain a cornerstone of our nation’s technological advancement,” said the statement. Hines, an alumnus of Yale University and Wake Forest University Law School, played for both North Carolina State and Yale. In 2022, he took a stab at elective politics, running as the Republican candidate for North Carolina’s 13th congressional district, where he narrowly lost to Democrat Wiley Nickel. He has long supported cryptocurrency, describing the assets as the “epitome of individual empowerment in finance” in a January 16 post on X. Further, he decried the “burdensome regulations” the Biden administration had placed on the industry, stating it needed “freedom to grow organically.” Pro-Crypto Appointments Since winning the U.S. presidential election, Trump has made several pro-crypto appointments in line with his campaign promise to make America the crypto capital of the world. On December 5, he chose David Sacks to oversee the AI and cryptocurrency sectors. At the time, he explained that his responsibilities would include positioning the U.S. as a world leader in these fields by protecting free speech online and countering Big Tech bias and censorship. The crypto czar was also tasked with creating a legal framework to address the sector’s demand for regulatory clarity, enabling its growth and success within the country. Under Trump’s administration, Sacks, in collaboration with the chairs of the Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC) and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), will lead efforts to reform digital currency policies backed by the new crypto council. Additionally, the president-elect has selected Paul Atkins to replace outgoing SEC Chair Gary Gensler, signaling his determination to reverse what he has described as the Biden administration’s “war on crypto,” primarily driven by the regulator under Gensler’s leadership. Congressman French Hill was also named the incoming chair of the House Financial Services Committee, effective in 2025. He is expected to play a crucial role in shaping legislative measures for the crypto sector in the year ahead.

Adding to the intrigue, Solana’s descent from $260 to $180 has seen it surpassed by $XRP in market capitalization, a development that has shocked the entire crypto community. Solana ($SOL): Struggling to Maintain $180 Solana has emerged as a primary force of the blockchain ecosystem, having been nicknamed “Ethereum killer” owing to its rapid transactions and low fees. Nonetheless, recent behavior of the market shows that $SOL is struggling to maintain its price levels. • Price Crash: From $260 to $180 — a drastic drop for Solana.• SURPRISING OUTCOME: This decline led to Ripple ($XRP) overtaking Solana per market cap.• Technical Challenges: Solana has experienced network outages and performance problems, resulting in a loss of investor confidence. Despite the attention on falling prices and TVL, Solana has a robust ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps) and projects that continue to drive growth. While investors are keeping an eye out for a comeback driven by network upgrades and developer activity. Ripple ($XRP): Battling Volatility Around $2 Ripple’s $XRP has been the talk of the town in recent weeks in light of a string of positive and negative news. After news broke of Gary Gensler’s exit from the SEC, seeing $XRP rally to $2.9; however, the asset has struggled to keep the buy side momentum. • Bearish pattern: $XRP has not been able to maintain the $2.1 area for the last 7 days and has formed a bearish M (Double Top) pattern.• Target price: This pattern gives a more bearish target of $1.5, which might concern traders.• Regulatory Overhang: Although the SEC-related positive news gave breathing space to $XRP in the short run, which could result in overhang for future upward price movement. Ripple’s utility through partnerships with financial institutions around the world continues to be visible, but there is scant evidence that price action is being driven by fundamentals as the market is still under the influence of short-term direction and technical signals. Altura ($ALU): Poised for a Bullish Breakout In contrast to $SOL and $XRP, Altura ($ALU) is capturing attention as it prepares for a significant bullish breakout. Altura is a blockchain project focused on powering gaming and NFTs through smart NFTs—dynamic, upgradeable NFTs that can change properties based on predefined conditions. Key factors driving Altura’s bullish outlook include: • AI Toolkit Announcement: Altura recently announced a new AI toolkit, which has generated excitement and renewed investor interest.• Bullish Chart Pattern: On the 4-hour chart, $ALU is forming a falling wedge pattern, a classic bullish indicator that suggests an imminent breakout. • Price Targets: Analysts predict that $ALU could reach new local highs of $0.2 in the short term. Long-term projections suggest even greater potential, with a market capitalization that could soar to $1 billion. Conclusion While Solana ($SOL) and Ripple ($XRP) navigate their respective challenges, Altura($ALU) is emerging as a promising investment opportunity. With its focus on gaming, NFTs, and AI innovation, Altura is positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for blockchain-based entertainment solutions. For investors, this divergence in performance highlights the importance of diversification and staying informed about emerging trends in the cryptocurrency space. Whether you’re holding $SOL, $XRP, or exploring $ALU, understanding the underlying factors driving these assets is crucial for making informed decisions in the volatile world of crypto trading.

38017697,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=666330,1734984033,"Bitcoin To Top Above $168,500 Based On This Indicator, Analyst Reveals","An analyst has explained how Bitcoin could see a top beyond the $168,500 mark based on the historical trend in this indicator. Bitcoin Mayer Multiple Could Reveal Location Of Next Price Top In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has discussed where the BTC top could lie based on the Mayer Multiple. The “Mayer Multiple” refers to an indicator that keeps track of the ratio between the Bitcoin price and its 200-day moving average (MA). The 200-day MA has historically proven to be a significant level for BTC, often serving as the boundary between bearish and bullish trends. As such, the distance of the price from this MA, which is what the Mayer Multiple measures, can be useful to watch. Related Reading: XRP Could Be The Altcoin To Recover Quickly, CryptoQuant Analyst Explains Why When the Mayer Multiple has a high value, it means the asset is trading significantly above the 200-day MA, which could imply potential overbought conditions. On the other hand, the metric being low could suggest a bullish reversal may be due for BTC. Now, here is the chart shared by Martinez that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Mayer Multiple represented as an oscillator over the history of the cryptocurrency: As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin Mayer Multiple is currently around halfway to the level that has usually signaled overheated conditions for the coin’s price. The level in question is situated at the 2.4 mark. When the metric assumes this value, the price of the asset becomes 2.4 times the 200-day MA. In the same chart, a price line corresponding to this level is also shown. It’s apparent that Bitcoin formed some of its major historical tops when it broke through the line. So far in the current cycle, Bitcoin hasn’t been able to retest the level yet. And it may not be able to do so for a while, either since the Mayer Multiple would only equal 2.4 when the cryptocurrency’s price rises to around the $168,500 level. Related Reading: XRP, Solana Among Altcoins Witnessing TD Buy Signal, Analyst Reveals An important level relevant to the Mayer Multiple that BTC did retest during this cycle was the 0.8 line. Just like the 2.4 level serves as a signal for potential overheated conditions, this line can imply the coin may be reaching a bottom. Bitcoin successfully found a rebound at the line earlier in the year, confirming that a transition towards a bear market hadn’t taken place yet. It now remains to be seen whether the asset would go on to retest the top level next or if another plunge to this bottom level will happen first. BTC Price Bitcoin slipped toward the $92,000 level on Friday, but it seems the asset has made some recovery since then, as it sits at $96,000 to kick off the new week.

Meanwhile, Ethereum bulls are swiftly flocking to a promising AI altcoin priced at $0.0243, which has shown a mind-blowing potential for 45,000% gains over just 14 days. The implications are clear: while the Dogecoin price fights the last, this unique token is carving a path to the future. Perceptive investors should follow the Ethereum bulls’ path in buying the WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale AI coin before it’s too late. You might also like: Bank of America manager says ADA not done, WallitIQ set for 77,000% breakout Dogecoin price faces familiar barrier, but WallitIQ promises 45,000% gains in 2 weeks Despite multiple attempts, the Dogecoin price still struggles to break through its long-standing resistance at $0.42. According to Binance, the Dogecoin price has spiked by 2% in the past 24 hours, following a 4% increase in Bitcoin (BTC) . Ethereum bulls, however, remain skeptical, believing that the Dogecoin price persistence to break its long-standing resistance is akin to climbing a greased pole. As the Dogecoin price continues its uphill battle, many Ethereum bulls are losing confidence and are instead looking toward a new AI coin: WallitIQ. Unlike the Dogecoin price, which primarily relies largely on Elon Musk and the influence of social media, WallitIQ is backed by solid utility and intrinsic value. With the WallitIQ token, investors can access premium features within the WallitIQ ecosystem. Additionally, this AI coin covers transaction and gas fees, easing the investment process. Knowing that WallitIQ has already seen a 42% price increase from its last presale to the current one, Ethereum bulls are eager to capitalize on the anticipated 71% rally as this presale stage nears its end. With only 20% of tokens remaining from this phase, thousands of investors are rushing to secure their shares of WallitIQ.

Musk the Manipulator (MUSKMANI), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKMANI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk the Manipulator can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk the Manipulator could become the next viral memecoin. Musk the Manipulator launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk the Manipulator on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk the Manipulator by entering its contract address – DZpfk5LaLrnP6vSFJnLSMAopUuTJGiFk7543rQxh4ids – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKMANI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | SHIB | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/solana-memecoin-musk-the-manipulator-muskmani-will-rally-14000-before-exchange-listing/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

The report, published today, predicts that investment advisors will control more than 50% of the Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) ETF markets, signaling a shift in the makeup of ETF holders. Since the launch of 11 spot BTC ETFs in the U.S. on Jan. 11, investors have put more than $36 billion into these funds, providing an easy way for individuals to gain exposure to Bitcoin without having to hold or store the asset directly. Hedge fund managers lead the way with 45.3% of the ETFs, while investment advisors who manage capital for individuals and high-net-worth individuals own 28%. CF Benchmarks, a UK-regulated index provider behind several major digital asset benchmarks, predicts that investment advisors will lead the $88 trillion US wealth management industry in embracing Bitcoin and ETH ETFs in 2025. This trend is expected to be driven by increased demand from clients, a better understanding of digital assets, and the maturation of crypto products. The firm also predicts that combined net flows into BTC and ETH ETFs will exceed $40 billion, a year-on-year record. Related News: Silent Bull in Ethereum? Analytics Firm Reveals Bullish Signs “Investment advisor allocations will rise above 50% for both assets, reshaping the ownership mix of these ETFs,” CF Benchmarks said in its annual report. “As these products become staples in model portfolios, they will likely reshape the market for digital assets.” In addition to Bitcoin, investment advisors are already the dominant force in the ETH ETF market and are expected to further strengthen their position in 2025. The growth in asset tokenization is expected to continue, with tokenized real-world assets (RWA) expected to exceed $30 billion, further supporting the demand for digital asset investment vehicles. CF Benchmarks also notes that new stablecoins like Ripple’s RLUSD and Paxos’ USDG are expected to challenge the dominance of Tether’s USDT, whose market share has increased from 50% to 70%. Going forward, the report predicts that the scalability of the blockchain will be tested and that active user adoption will require increasing on-chain capacity beyond 1,600 transactions per second (TPS) due to regulatory clarity under President-elect Donald Trump’s administration. *This is not investment advice.

38016956,https://coinpedia.org/?p=396790,1734982536,IRS Rules Crypto Staking Rewards Taxable In Ongoing Lawsuit,"The post IRS Rules Crypto Staking Rewards Taxable In Ongoing Lawsuit appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As per the latest Bloomberg report , the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has officially said that crypto staking is taxable, stating that tax liabilities arise as soon as staking rewards are received. IRS Rules Crypto Staking Triggers Tax Liability Immediately This ruling comes amidst an ongoing lawsuit from Joshua and Jessica Jarrett, a Tennessee couple staking on the Tezos network, who filed a lawsuit against the government regarding the tax clarification for crypto staking and how the IRS views it. Notably, in a Dec. 20 court filing, the IRS rejected the Jarretts’ claim that staking generates “new property” that should only be taxed when sold. The government noted that “staking a cryptocurrency should induce a tax liability as soon as it is done.” It denied the idea that staking tokens fall under the same category as crops, books, or manufactured goods. Significant Implications On Taxation Of PoS Rewards The legal battle was filed in October of this year and could have massive consequences. The case is being closely watched by the crypto industry, as it could have significant implications for how staking rewards across all proof-of-stake blockchains are taxed in the United States. The Jarretts’ legal battle with the IRS began back in 2021 when they sued for a refund of $3,293 in taxes paid on 8,876 Tezos tokens earned through staking in 2019, before the tokens were sold or exchanged. They argued that the tokens were “new property” that were created through their staking efforts and should only be taxed when sold, similar to a farmer’s crop or an author’s manuscript. In 2022, the IRS tried to dismiss the case by offering the Jarretts a $4,000 tax refund for income taxes paid on their Tezos rewards. However, the Jarretts refused the refund and chose to continue the lawsuit to set a legal precedent for all staking participants across proof-of-stake networks. “A year and a half into this process, the government didn’t want to defend the position that the tokens I created through staking were taxable income. I need a better answer. So I refused the government’s offer to pay me a refund,” Jarrett stated. According to IRS guidelines released in 2023, block rewards from staking or mining are considered taxable income as soon as they are created, with tax liabilities determined by their market value at the time of creation.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/irs-rules-crypto-staking-rewards-taxable-in-ongoing-lawsuit/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Whale Trigger Sell-off on Chainlink as Link’s Price Moves Catch Attention Data from LookOnChain shows that on December 18, 2024, a Chainlink whale withdrew 65,000 LINK tokens worth $1.8 million. This added to a four-day spree, taking their total investment to over $17.3 million. This buying spree came shortly after Donald Trump’s World Liberty Financial bought LINK tokens worth $2 million. Ahead of its DeFi launch, the Foundation picked Chainlink as its oracle provider. Meanwhile, LINK’s price movement recently failed to impress Chainlink bulls. LINK is trading at $24.89, a 15.02% decline in its price. Concerning price predictions, analysts believe LINK’S downtrend will continue because it is in a consolidation phase. Therefore, LINK could fall to $20 soon. On the other hand, some experts are positive that LINK will soon recover due to Chainlink’s collaboration with other projects. As such, LINK could rise to $35 in a few weeks. But the main question is, is LINK the best crypto to buy now? Experts say $FXG already raised $3 million in just two stages and may be the better choice. Whale Moves Shake Meme Coins: Is DOGE Still the Best Crypto to Buy? A recent Whale Alert revealed that a whale recently transferred 4.999 billion DOGE , worth over $2 billion, to an unknown wallet. The wallet now holds over 5.565 billion DOGE, valued at $2.2 billion. Massive transfers like these often impact coin prices. While some traders are optimistic about DOGE, others see risks. The uncertainty makes people wonder if this is a smart move or a warning sign. Meanwhile, DOGE’s value is dropping. CoinMarketCap data shows that DOGE is trading at $0.358, a 12.49% decline from last week. Top Dogecoin experts still believe that DOGE will buck the bearish trend soon and surge to $0.480 in a few weeks. On the flip side, some analysts are cautious in their Dogecoin outlook because the crypto market has been experiencing losses recently. They fear that DOGE could fall to $0.280 soon. Looking for the best crypto to buy? Experts say meme coins may dip in the next quarter; instead, they recommend $FXG for its huge growth potential. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE $FXG Stands Out as the Best Crypto to Buy in a Bearish Market! Investors are turning to $FXG as the best crypto to buy right now. With impressive growth potential, it has already shown strong gains. Analysts say those who joined the Private Sale Round saw their investment grow by 166%, which makes it a promising option in today’s market.

Those who purchased the coin in Stage 1 already saw a 33% ROI when the coin moved into Stage 2. This performance is drawing attention from both new and experienced investors. Even in a bearish market, Stage 2 investors can aim for 25% returns as $FXG moves into Stage 3, where the price will rise to $0.05. Experts believe this price momentum could help $FXG climb even further in the coming weeks. Many market gurus predict it could skyrocket by 10,000% after being listed on major exchanges. These predictions reinforce its position as the best crypto to invest in right now. Getting started with $FXG is simple.

The altcoin season index at 46 indicated that interest had waned as a result of Bitcoin’s poor performance and a slightly bearish sentiment prevailing in the market. The apex crypto remained the dominating force, accounting for over 57% of the current market capitalisation. Will Bitcoin rise again? The Christmas season usually brings market gains, which traders refer to as the “Santa Rally.” But this year, it seems to be running late. Hawkish remarks from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell last week are being touted as the primary reason why Bitcoin is having difficulties breaking past the six-figure mark again. Meanwhile, there has been an uptick in profit-taking among long-term investors ever since BTC hit an all-time high (ATH) of $108,135. Although major corporations like MicroStrategy and Japan’s MetaPlanet , along with El Salvador and whale investors, continued buying the dip, analysts cautioned that BTC may have entered a correction phase. However, it’s important to note that experts have constantly reminded us that such corrections are healthy for extended rallies. Bitcoin’s performance during previous bull runs also paints a similar picture, as the bellwether is known to correct as much as 20% after hitting a new ATH. Prominent analyst Rekt Capital told his over 522k followers on X that BTC had recently confirmed a Bearish Engulfing candlestick formation on the weekly chart after losing a key support level. According to the analyst, this can be considered a sign that the cryptocurrency is “transitioning into a multi-week correction.” This correction phase could last a few more weeks, according to pseudonymous analyst Jelle Eyed, who pointed to historical price action. On the contrary, Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards offered a bullish perspective via another historical pattern. Notably, December 26th, which is just three days away, is historically the best-performing day for the crypto market, with the highest daily gains. As such, he floated the idea of a potential “X-mas relief bounce.” Trader Josh Rager, however, suggested Bitcoin could drop to $75,000, noting it’s in line with the typical 30% pullback seen during bull runs. Upon writing, one BTC was selling for $93,260, and the price was down 2.1% in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, the leading gainers for the altcoin market at press time were: Aave Decentralised money market protocol Aave was the best-performing project for the day, with AAVE up 12.4% per cent in the past 24 hours. Source: CoinMarketCap With a market cap of over $5 billion, the token saw an uptick in trading activity, confirmed by its trading volume, which was up over 64.30% in the past 24 hours. There was no particular reason behind the price surge, and the gains were part of a broader recovery across the defi sector. Strong technicals and retail buying also helped AAVE’s price action. The altcoin has broken out of the $298 support level, and analysts expect prices to climb higher if Bitcoin trades sideways in the coming days and could potentially break its all-time high of $661,69 as early as the first quarter of 2025. Virtuals Protocol VIRTUAL, the native token for the AI agen launchpad Virtual s protocol, rallied over 8% in the past 24 hours to hit an intraday high of $2.72. Source: CoinMarketCap At press time, the altcoin held a market capitalisation of roughly $2.5 billion with a daily trading volume of a little over $300 million, which was up 29.70% in the past day. With no particular protocol-related development driving the current rally, VIRTUAL continued to benefit from the hype around AI agents this season. Users are required to lock the altcoin on the platform to launch AI agents, which fuels demand and helps push the token’s price. Analysts remain positive over the token’s short-term prospects with some pointing to current price levels as a good entry point. Long term targets for the token range from $8 to $10. When writing, the token was trading at $2.58. Raydium Raydium (RAY) was up 6.7% in the past 24 hours, reaching a daily high of $4.66. Its total market capitalisation stood over $1.3 billion. Source: CoinMarketCap The native token for the decentralised exchange was also one of the benefactors of the defi market rebound. The Solana-based dex has seen significant activity as a result of meme coins, leading to a surge in the price of RAY. Tokens launched on the popular meme coin deployer Pump.fun have contributed to this increased activity. Pump.fun allows users to create meme coins on the Solana blockchain, and once a token’s market cap reaches $69,000, liquidity is automatically added to Raydium. This surge in meme coin activity has driven higher trading volumes on Raydium, boosting the platform’s fee revenue and staking rewards for RAY holders, thereby incentivising more traders to buy and stake the altcoin. With meme coins booming, analysts expect the hype to continue, driving more demand for RAY and potentially pushing its price higher.

38016687,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=632452,1734981639,South Korea join US against North Korean hackers involved in crypto thefts,"South Korea has teamed up with the US in efforts to fight against North Korean hackers linked to cryptocurrency heists, according to the latest reports. The collaboration between the two countries involves initiatives to track stolen digital assets and curb malicious activities that have resulted in over a billion dollars worth of cryptocurrency lost to the gang. This comes as the value of stolen cryptocurrencies rose by 21% to $2.2 billion this year while the number of recorded hacks reached an all-time high of 303. Leading institutions in South Korea back the efforts to tackle crimes The collaboration is aimed at developing tools that counter crypto-related crimes, especially those linked to the North Korean hackers. According to reports , the North Korean hackers have stolen up to $1.6 billion worth of digital assets this year alone. One of the most daring crypto thefts attributed to the North Korean gang involved 4,500 bitcoins worth $305 million from a Japanese crypto exchange DMM in May. In August, Microsoft’s cybersecurity researchers learned of the hackers’ misdemeanors, their report revealed, adding that they took advantage of a previously unknown bug in Chrome to target organizations and steal their cryptocurrency. The report further states that the gang was affiliated with Citrine Sleet, which is known for targeting the crypto industry and financial service providers in general. Now, the initiatives between the UU and South Korea also signal the intensifying crackdown on illicit crypto activities that are becoming a threat to economic stability and national security. South Korea’s science ministry has thrown its weight behind the program through to 2026. This collaboration also involves other organizations such as Korea University, US-based RAND Corporation, and other government bodies as they seek to tackle the escalating threat. According to Invezz , the two countries have signed an agreement to come up with strategies to prevent and track thefts linked to North Korea. This collaboration, though the finer details of the agreement remained sketchy, it represents a major step towards the fight against the growing influence of North Korea-linked crypto hackers. However, the experts who are coming together in this collaboration will focus on tracking stolen funds and identifying the laundering methods, as well as preventing more attacks. The initiatives will dismantle enablers for the hackers They will also make use of advanced technologies in their efforts to identify how illicit funds are converted into digital assets using methods like ransomware and distributed across global networks. Blockchain analysis firm, Chainalysis has also emphasized the need to have such measures to tackle this threat, in which the North Korean hackers account for a significant share of the stolen crypto worldwide. The collaboration is therefore intended to dismantle the infrastructure enabling such cybercrimes, addressing the technical complexities of tracking digital transactions across decentralized networks. Putting together resources by the two countries, they aim to come up with a blue print that can be adopted by other countries who are facing similar threats. The initiative will continue through 2026, while it is expected to pave way for more international partnerships to the challenges posed by the growing adoption of cryptocurrencies. According to Invezz, the combined efforts by the two countries might weaken the networks that enable the North Korea-linked crypto crimes. However, this calls for sustained innovations to stay ahead of the cybercriminals due to the decentralized and anonymous nature of most blockchain platforms. Meanwhile, the US is trying to curb the North Korean crypto criminal activities by using regulatory measures. Recently, the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control imposed sanctions on two individuals and a United Arab Emirates-based company for their alleged roles in laundering funds obtained through North Korean cybercrimes. The two individuals used the company to convert stolen crypto assets and send the money through to North Korea. By targeting enablers in dominions with weak regulatory frameworks, the US aims to disturb the flow of illicit funds supporting North Korea’s broader activities such as the development of nuclear weapons. According to TechCrunch , due to tight international sanctions, the regime in North Korea has turned to stealing crypto to fund its nuclear weapons. A UN panel of experts monitoring the implementation of international sanctions has also revealed that North Korea uses funds raised through cyber crimes to support its illicit ballistic missile and nuclear programs.

Qubetics Could Be Your Next Big Break in Crypto,"The crypto market is buzzing with both seasoned investors and curious newcomers looking for the next big opportunity. Decentralised finance (DeFi) platforms like Aave (AAVE) have transformed the landscape, offering ways to lend and borrow digital assets with ease. Aave’s early investors saw their portfolios soar as the token rose to prominence, cementing its place as a DeFi leader. But if you didn’t get in early, it can feel like you missed the boat. Now, there’s a new contender shaking up the crypto world: Qubetics ($TICS). Positioned as the world’s first Web3 aggregator, Qubetics aims to solve the issues traditional blockchain platforms have struggled with—complexity, inefficiency, and lack of accessibility. By blending innovation with practical solutions, Qubetics is gearing up to be a game-changer. Qubetics ($TICS): Simplifying Crypto for Everyone If Aave showed the potential of DeFi, Qubetics takes it a step further by focusing on accessibility and integration. Its standout feature? The Multi-Chain Wallet. This isn’t just another crypto wallet; it’s a powerhouse that simplifies how users manage digital assets and perform transactions across multiple blockchains. Imagine a business owner who wants to accept payments in crypto but is deterred by the volatility and complexity of managing multiple wallets. With Qubetics, they can accept payments in any cryptocurrency, which is automatically converted to fiat at the point of sale. This eliminates the risk of market fluctuations and ensures a seamless experience for both the business and its customers. For individuals, the wallet’s integration with platforms like Apple Pay and Google Pay makes crypto transactions as simple as swiping a card. Whether you’re booking a flight, paying for dinner, or shopping online, Qubetics allows you to use your digital assets without breaking a sweat. Travellers, gig workers, and even small businesses can benefit from the wallet’s features, which make managing and spending crypto easier than ever before. Currently in its 14th stage, the Qubetics presale is creating a buzz. Over 372 million tokens have been sold to more than 11,500 holders, raising $7.5 million so far. Tokens are priced at $0.0377, but that won’t last long. A 10% price increase is expected in the 15th stage, which kicks off this weekend. If you’re looking for the best crypto presale to buy this week, $TICS is an opportunity you can’t afford to ignore. With its innovative technology and real-world applications, Qubetics is setting itself up to be a key player in the blockchain space. Aave (AAVE): A DeFi Pioneer Aave has been a trailblazer in the world of decentralised finance. As one of the first platforms to offer DeFi lending and borrowing, Aave redefined what was possible in crypto. By using smart contracts, Aave enables users to lend assets and earn interest or borrow against their holdings—all without the need for a central authority. Aave has continued to evolve, recently launching its decentralised stablecoin, GHO. This move aims to diversify its offerings and solidify its position as a leader in DeFi. Analysts predict that Aave will maintain steady growth as DeFi adoption increases globally. Its price performance has been impressive, with projections pointing to a potential 20% increase in Q1 2025 as the platform expands its ecosystem. However, Aave’s high price point might be a barrier for new investors. For those looking to replicate the gains early Aave investors enjoyed, exploring newer opportunities like Qubetics could be a smarter move. Conclusion If you missed Aave’s early days, don’t sweat it. The crypto market is constantly evolving, and Qubetics presents a unique opportunity to invest in something groundbreaking from the start. Its Multi-Chain Wallet and Web3 aggregator model promise to revolutionise how people interact with digital assets. Paired with Aave’s continued growth as a DeFi leader, these two projects highlight the endless possibilities in the crypto space. But if you’re looking for the best crypto presale to buy this week, Qubetics might just be the second chance you’ve been waiting for. Based on the latest research, we recommend Qubetics ($TICS) and Aave (AAVE) as the top crypto investments to consider this week .

Following the allegation, the platform token HYPE dropped over 25%, from $34 to $25. The platform assured users that their funds remained secure and accounted for. Security Dispute or Misunderstanding? Hyperliquid’s Response to Allegations of North Korean Hackers The controversy began when Taylor Monahan, a security expert from MetaMask, reported suspicious trades involving wallets tied to North Korean hackers. According to Monahan, these wallets traded ETH on Hyperliquid, resulting in liquidations exceeding $700,000.

They stated that the advisor’s conduct prompted the team to consult trusted partners instead. The allegations and subsequent market uncertainty immediately impacted Hyperliquid’s native token, HYPE. The token dropped over 25%, from $34 on Sunday to a low of $25 on Monday. However, according to DexScreener , the price has since rebounded and is trading at $27. Despite the controversy, Hyperliquid continues gaining traction. According to Dune Analytics , the platform accounts for over 55% of the trading volume of on-chain perpetual futures. North Korean Hackers Steal Over $1.3 Billion in Crypto, Doubling 2023’s Theft Total According to Chainalysis, North Korean hackers doubled their crypto thefts from 2023 to 2024, stealing over $1.3 billion. In its Dec. 19 report, the firm revealed that these hackers were responsible for 47 incidents, accounting for 61% of all crypto thefts in 2024. This marked a sharp increase from $660 million stolen in 2023. Chainalysis noted an increase in the size of individual heists. Attacks between $50 and $100 million and those exceeding $100 million were more common in 2024. The firm said the DPRK is improving at executing larger and faster exploits. North Korean hackers have been linked to some of the most significant breaches in the crypto industry. U.S. authorities frequently sanction entities involved in the country’s laundering operations. Despite the rise in DPRK-related hacks, global crypto hacking activity declined in the third and fourth quarters of 2024. Chainalysis suggested North Korea may rely less on crypto theft due to closer ties with Russia. However, it warned of potential changes by year’s end, noting hackers often strike during holidays. The timing of reduced activity after July 1 coincided with Russian President Putin’s visit to Pyongyang, though Chainalysis stated the connection remains unclear.

However, Solana differed in performance, recording $8.7 million in outflows. The net inflows suggest that institutional players remain confident and interested in digital assets. According to James Butterfill, Coinshares Head of Research, this is significant as the ETPs overcame macroeconomic conditions. Butterfill emphasized that multi-asset investment products recorded significant outflows despite these positive highlights. The cumulative outflows by these products amounted to $121 million. According to Butterfill, varied inflows came in for XRP at $8.8 million, Polkadot at $1.9 million, and Horizen at $4.8 million. This suggests that investors in these altcoins have adopted a strategic selective approach to their portfolio. The Federal Reserve’s Role in Market Dynamics Meanwhile, last week, the largest single day of outflows were registered. Notably, on December 19, a total of $576 million was recorded, and the outflow of December 20 pushed the cumulative total to $1 billion. Butterfill highlights this development as significant and a pointer to the volatility experienced last week. However, the Federal Reserve’s news briefing after its meeting on December 18 played a huge role in influencing market dynamics. Besides the rate cut, Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s remarks of a hawkish economic outlook triggered risk sentiments across the financial space. Hence, many, including MARA , a Bitcoin mining company, looked to digital assets as a way out. Investors’ Approach to the Crypto Investment Product Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve has revised its 2025 core personal consumption expenditure inflation projection figures from 2.2% to 2.5%. Stakeholders had anticipated a four-rate cut, but only two were implemented for 2025. In November, the Federal Reserve’s interest rate cut significantly impacted digital assets. Analysts note that the market is in a state where derivatives traders are protecting their positions and betting on price drops for assets. Additionally, the market appears poised for downside volatility. All these could influence asset prices in the coming days.

38016189,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=632445,1734980423,Crypto industry in the US anticipates early executive orders by Donald Trump,"The crypto industry is urging Donald Trump’s team to begin his promised crypto policy changes when he becomes president next month. Industry officials say they want him to use executive orders to make cryptocurrencies more mainstream. According to Reuters , Trump plans to sign many executive orders and directives on his first day in office, covering topics like immigration and energy. During his campaign, Trump attracted crypto supporters by promising to be a “crypto president.” The industry expects him to fulfill that promise with executive orders to build a bitcoin reserve, provide crypto businesses access to banking, and establish a crypto council. Two sources report that they have been calling for these executive orders within Trump’s first 100 days and are hopeful that at least one will be signed on 2oth January 2025. Rebecca Rettig, Polygon Labs’ chief legal and policy officer, said executive orders must clearly outline the main priorities from day one and offer a roadmap. Concerned about crime and instability, Biden’s regulators have tightened rules on crypto companies. Trump has promised to change this. His crypto policy team is forming, including the crypto-friendly SEC chair Paul Atkins and White House crypto czar David Sacks , announced this month. Brian Hughes, a spokesperson for Trump’s transition team, said Washington’s bureaucracy has tried to hinder innovation, “but President Trump will deliver on his promise to encourage American leadership in crypto.” Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency, reached new highs of over $107,000 this month after Trump repeated his plan from a July speech to create a strategic bitcoin reserve. It has since dropped below $100,000. Experts disagree on whether Trump can use executive powers, possibly through the Treasury Department, to create the reserve or if Congress needs to pass a law. Treasury Secretary to spend $21 billion in a year to build a national bitcoin reserve The Bitcoin Policy Institute, an industry group, has drafted a possible executive order that Trump could use to set up the Bitcoin Reserve. According to the draft seen by Reuters, it would label bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset and direct the Treasury Secretary to spend $21 billion in a year to build a national bitcoin reserve. Zack Shapiro, head of policy at the Bitcoin Policy Institute, said the US should lead its geopolitical rivals in using Bitcoin instead of letting the price rise without the US having reserves. He did not say if the group shared the draft with Trump’s team. In July, Trump said he would not allow banks to “choke” crypto firms out of the traditional financial system. Some executives think he will address this with an executive order. Crypto companies have often complained that banks avoid working with them because of regulations. Even though regulators say, banks can lend to crypto firms that comply with the law. Federal bank regulators are independent from Trump’s executive orders Some executives warned that even if Trump signs an executive order telling bank regulators to be lenient on crypto, it would mostly signal intentions and offer political support. It probably wouldn’t have legal power because federal bank regulators are independent. According to Jonah Krane, a partner at Klaros Group, they won’t change policies immediately, but they will indicate the administration’s desired direction.” Trump also plans to form a crypto industry council, and his team is figuring out its structure and staffing. Executives said that past administrations have created special councils through executive orders. Trump might address crypto’s concerns that current regulations don’t suit the industry by issuing an executive order outlining key principles for crypto regulation. This would be like an order he signed in 2017 that asked regulators to reassess banking rules. Krane added, “I wouldn’t be surprised if you get something like an executive order early on that directs the agencies to re-examine their rules in this space” A Step-By-Step System To Launching Your Web3 Career and Landing High-Paying Crypto Jobs in 90 Days.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | FIAT | MATIC | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/crypto-industry-donald-trump/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/38016189.jpeg

The Chainlink Smart Value Recapture is a MEV solution that DeFi applications can tap into to recapture non-toxic maximal extractable value from Chainlink Price Feeds. According to an announcement by the Chainlink ( LINK ) team, the initial version of its SVR is an effort contributed to by Aave ( AAVE ) DAO contributors BGD Labs and Flashbots among others. Chainlink SVR’s initial focus is DeFi lending protocols, according to Chainlink. It’s one of the solutions looking to help protocols recapture MEV from liquidations. Projects such as Chainlink, Pyth Network and API3 are at the forefront of offering solutions that enable efficiency for DeFi lending protocols. These initiatives are helping projects recapture millions of dollars worth of non-toxic MEV. You might also like: Pyth Network launches “Express Relay” to address problem of MEV SVR, built on Chainlink’s infrastructure works by allowing projects to cut needless third-party dependencies. It also removes the need for intermediary smart contracts integrations, while leveraging Flashbots for efficiency and security. This is the functionality of the Flashbots’ MEV-Share and contract architecture dubbed “Dual Aggregator”. “Based on real-world testing, we believe Chainlink SVR can expect to achieve a realistic value recapture rate of approximately 40% (i.e., for every $100 that would have been leaked via liquidation MEV, $40 was recaptured).” Chainlink Team in the blog announcement Also notably, a governance proposal for Chainlink SVR integration on Aave is ongoing. If the Aave community approves the proposal by BGD Labs, the DeFi protocol will benefit from a new revenue stream. Value recaptured by the MEV solution will thus offer Aave additional revenue as well as support Chainlink oracles’ economic sustainability.

Donald Saves Crypto (DONALCRY), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONALCRY is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald Saves Crypto can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald Saves Crypto could become the next viral memecoin. Donald Saves Crypto launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.

42416831,e7cbb59b-85c3-4180-86c0-5be58166b425,1734978946,"What the Key Metrics for Onchain Activity Say About SOL, ETH and Other Chains in 2025","Web3 is drowning in metrics, most of which paint an unclear picture. Transaction volumes, token prices and flashy headlines often mask what really matters: the quality of user engagement and the potential for organic, exponential growth. As the industry moves beyond the hype, reliable, data-driven signals of success are no longer optional — they’re essential.  Here’s the good news: the tools to cut through the noise already exist. By combining multiple on-chain metrics into a single “health index” score indicating the depth and quality of overall user engagement, we can identify which chains are truly thriving and poised for long-term growth. With 2024 coming to a close, let’s dig into what these signals reveal about today’s leading chains, and what we can expect in 2025.  Assessing user quality using aggregated, not isolated, data  When creating a sustainable on-chain ecosystem, it doesn’t make sense to optimize any single user action. What’s needed is context — a way to quantify not just everything users are doing, but how and why it matters. One promising approach to achieve this is to aggregate user behaviors into five core categories:    Transaction Activity, ranging from spot trades to smart contract interactions.  Token Accumulation in the medium-to-long-term, and other “investment” behaviors.  DeFi Engagement for activities like staking, lending and liquidity provision.  NFT Activity such as minting, trading and utility-driven interactions.  Governance Participation to quantify DAO or protocol governance contributions.    Crucially, these metrics should not be treated equally. A better approach is to weigh and combine them using a Bayesian model to generate a single top-line “score.” Unlike traditional scoring systems that rely on static thresholds or simple averages, this lets us incorporate both prior knowledge (what we expect from an “average” wallet) and new evidence (actual activity observed on-chain). These dynamic, multi-variate scores are much harder to game and therefore more likely to reveal accurate, actionable insights.  What the data tells us about 2024  The above approach provides a fresh perspective on each chain’s user activity through 2024. Let’s zoom in on some of the more surprising findings.      Solana (the top light blue line that peaks at ~2.75) attracted a huge share of high-quality users between February and mid-March, but engagement quality has fallen since. Interestingly, this downslide coincided with SOL’s first price and trading volume spike of 2024, and has continued through the current memecoin mania. Repetitive actions have diminishing returns when assessed using a Bayesian model, meaning multiple token swaps yield smaller score improvements than engagement across multiple types of activities, for any given wallet. This suggests most Solana users are currently engaged in a narrow range of on-chain activities that aren’t contributing to Solana’s multi-sector growth.  As for Ethereum supporters (the bottom orange line that begins at just above 1) who expected this year’s ETH ETFs to be a game-changer, the numbers paint a different picture. Ethereum’s low and stable user score through H1 2024 suggests that this year’s bullish developments did not spur broader ecosystem participation such as DeFi activity and protocol governance.  It’s also worth noting that Axelar (the dark blue line that begins at 2.5) had the most active users across the broadest range of on-chain activities relative to its total user base, according to the data. While Axelar is currently much smaller by TVL than the legacy chains dominating today’s headlines, this is an intriguing signal that warrants closer inspection — and would have been missed if we were looking at market cap or trading volume alone.  The takeaway here isn’t that Solana is doomed and Axelar will inevitably become the world’s biggest chain. There is limited value in comparing these types of scores across chains, since each score is proportional to the user quality of its corresponding chain. In other words, a Solana user with a score of “4” may be very different from a “4” on Axelar, given the differences in each chain’s baseline activity. As such, these scores are most useful when tracking changes in the quality of a chain’s overall user activity over time, not cross-chain comparisons.  Predictions for 2025  With that said, what does each chain’s user quality track record tell us about next year?  For starters, it’s clear that Solana faces significant challenges and opportunities entering 2025. The chain’s trajectory depends on its ability to retain its massive casual user base and expand their range of on-chain interactions. Failure to do so could result in a significant slump once memecoins cool off — although data from early 2024 suggests the chain has a large contingent of quality users that will endure regardless of what happens short-term.  2024 demonstrated Axelar’s ability to attract a concentrated user base engaged in diverse, sustained on-chain activities, rather than speculative surges. Now, Axelar’s challenge will be upscaling its ecosystem without diluting the quality of its user base. This may involve prioritizing high-profile partnerships to unlock new audiences while creating more newbie-friendly onramps across its dApp ecosystem.  Ethereum’s fragmentation has shifted many active users to its faster, cheaper L2 ecosystem, and so we may see mainnet activity increasingly consolidate around core features protocol staking and governance. These activities are critical for the broader EVM ecosystem, but this trajectory may be penalized by scoring systems that reward diverse on-chain engagement.  This dynamic underscores a challenge for scoring systems: prioritizing wide-ranging user activity can present an incomplete picture when applied to task-specific networks (or general purpose chains that are evolving into something more specialized). As a result, it’s important to clearly define what success means for whatever chain is being evaluated and use a scoring system that captures the corresponding user actions.  A better way to define, and drive, on-chain growth  Web3 has spent too long chasing the wrong metrics and failing to view the data in aggregate. In 2025, the winners will be those who find multivariate ways to measure — and act on — what matters most: user quality.  By incorporating new scoring methods into their dashboards, on-chain intelligence platforms can provide more meaningful insights to investors and industry observers. At the same time, Web3 builders can use these scores to clarify top priorities and drive user engagement and value creation. Ultimately, this will help the entire industry shift away from hype-driven narratives to data-backed strategies that unlock the full potential of Web3 in 2025 and beyond.",NEUTRAL,ETH | SOL,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,"Dr. Angela Minster, Eric Stone",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/12/23/what-the-key-metrics-for-onchain-activity-say-about-sol-eth-and-other-chains-in-2025,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a2296275e801777a81bb8369779088939e562a77-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This marks its seventh consecutive week of Bitcoin purchases . The purchase comes as MicroStrategy officially begins trading as a member of the Nasdaq-100 equity index. MicroStrategy Buys More Bitcoin At An Average Price Of $106K According to a Monday announcement , MicroStrategy purchased 5,262 Bitcoin between December 16 and December 22 and now holds 444,262 BTC in total, valued at over $41 billion as of press time. MicroStrategy bought its latest Bitcoin at an average price of $106,662 per coin — the highest cost the firm has ever paid per BTC. The latest purchase contributes to the firm’s outstanding Bitcoin yield of 47.4% quarter-to-date and 73.7% year-to-date, raising the average cost to $62,257 per Bitcoin. MicroStrategy has acquired 5,262 BTC for ~$561 million at ~$106,662 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 47.4% QTD and 73.7% YTD.

Last week, MicroStrategy sold 1.3 million shares, generating roughly $561 million in net proceeds. While MicroStrategy has been snapping up the apex crypto since 2020, Monday’s announcement came at a historic time for the Michael Saylor-founded company. MicroStrategy was added to the Nasdaq-100 index earlier this month. MicroStrategy’s shares officially started trading as part of the index on December 23. The listing is bullish for the crypto industry as it indicates more mainstream acceptance of the fast-growing sector. Back in October, MicroStrategy announced plans to raise $42 billion in capital to support further Bitcoin purchases as part of its treasury reserve strategy. As of December 22, the firm revealed it had about $7 billion worth of shares still available for sale as part of its planned $21 billion equity offering and $21 billion in fixed-income securities. Bitcoin Price Action MicroStrategy’s latest BTC purchase aligns with Michael Saylor’s pledge earlier this month to continue scooping up BTC even at peak prices. “I’m sure that I will be buying Bitcoin at $1 million a coin — probably $1 billion dollars a day of Bitcoin at $1 million a coin,” Saylor posited. However, the price of BTC has plummeted by around 13.7% over the last six days since hitting a new record high mark above $108,000. The correction came after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank would reduce interest rates at a slower pace in 2025. Powell also clarified that the Fed was “not allowed to own Bitcoin” and “not looking for a law change.” The top crypto was changing hands for $93,458 as of publication time, representing a 2.3% drop on the day.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/microstrategy-continues-bitcoin-buying-spree-with-latest-5262-btc-purchase-amid-nasdaq-100-entry/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

Despite the sharp correction, DOGE has managed to hold above the critical $0.30 level, providing hope for a potential rebound. This level now serves as a vital support zone as bulls aim to reclaim momentum. Related Reading: Ethereum Whales Bought $1 Billion ETH In The Past 96 Hours – Details Top analyst Ali Martinez has drawn attention to an intriguing comparison on X, highlighting similarities between Dogecoin’s current price behavior and its performance in 2017. According to Martinez, DOGE’s historical patterns suggest that periods of sharp corrections have often preceded explosive parabolic rallies. If history repeats itself, Dogecoin could be gearing up for another meteoric rise. Market sentiment remains a mix of caution and optimism as traders monitor whether DOGE can maintain support and establish a foundation for upward momentum. The comparison to 2017 adds weight to the bullish case, as Dogecoin is well-known for its rapid and unpredictable price surges. 2017 vs 2025: What To Expect? Dogecoin (DOGE) appears to be mirroring its historical price patterns, setting the stage for a potential parabolic rally in 2024. According to top analyst Ali Martinez, who shared a detailed technical analysis on X, Dogecoin’s current price structure closely resembles its behavior during previous bull runs in 2017 and 2021. This comparison has sparked excitement among investors anticipating a massive breakout. In 2017, Dogecoin experienced a 212% surge, followed by a 40% retracement before skyrocketing 5,000%. Similarly, in 2021, DOGE surged 476%, retraced 56%, and then achieved an astonishing 12,000% rally. Now, in 2024, Dogecoin has already climbed 440% and retraced by 46%. Martinez notes that if history repeats itself, DOGE could be gearing up for another explosive rally, potentially breaking its all-time highs and entering price discovery. Such a pattern indicates that Dogecoin may deliver gains far beyond current expectations. A move into price discovery could propel DOGE to unprecedented levels, driven by renewed investor enthusiasm and FOMO (fear of missing out) as it regains momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Will Test ATH Once It Breaks This Strong Supply Zone – Details While past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, Dogecoin’s ability to replicate its historic cycles makes it one of the most closely watched cryptocurrencies. If the meme-inspired coin follows its established trend, 2024 could mark another defining chapter in Dogecoin’s journey. Dogecoin Testing Crucial Demand Dogecoin (DOGE) is currently trading at $0.31 after enduring days of significant volatility and uncertainty. The recent rebound from the $0.26 low has provided a much-needed boost to investor confidence, suggesting that DOGE’s price may have found solid footing to build further momentum. This quick recovery indicates underlying strength, raising hopes for continued upward movement. However, the $0.31 level remains a critical barrier for Dogecoin. If the price fails to reclaim and hold this level as support, it could result in a period of sideways consolidation, potentially delaying any meaningful recovery. Such a consolidation phase would likely keep DOGE range-bound, frustrating traders looking for clearer signals of direction. Related Reading: XRP Holds Key Demand Level – Whale Activity Suggests Strength On the bullish side, a decisive push above the $0.36 mark could trigger a swift recovery, paving the way for Dogecoin to challenge higher resistance levels.

On December 23, the China National Intellectual Property Administration (CNIPA) disclosed a patent application that outlines a device, method, and computer program aimed at encrypting digital assets. The patent application also revealed that the device and program involve a component which is specifically designed for the encryption of digital assets. It also outlines the use of indexes of digital assets for encryption purposes, suggesting that the proposed technology could provide an essential function for digital asset security. Nokia’s Blockchain and Metaverse Ventures For a long time, Nokia has been exploring innovations in blockchain and the metaverse. In 2021, it launched the Nokia Data Marketplace, a blockchain-based platform aimed at facilitating enterprise-level data transactions and analysis, which uses permissioned blockchain infrastructure. This technology highlights Nokia’s commitment to develop practical blockchain solutions for businesses. In 2023, the company embarked into the metaverse with a unique project involving a 5G-connected microbrewery. Researchers in Australia and Germany collaborated in the project on brewing experiments, which utilized augmented reality (AR) technology. The researchers used digital simulations to “perfect beer” in the virtual space, which depicts Nokia’s interest in leveraging emerging technologies for innovative applications. Nokia’s efforts also extend to the telecommunications industry. On March 1, the company revealed its intentions to build network architecture to cater to the emerging innovations market. It anticipates a 22% to 25% increase in network demand by 2030. This strategy is part of the company’s broader plan to meet the needs of the rapidly growing innovations market. Nokia’s Increasing Involvement In Digital Space This move signals Nokia’s increasing involvement in the digital asset space and hints at the development of technology that could play a key role in securing cryptocurrency and other digital assets. Nokia’s entry into this space can be seen as a push by traditional telecom companies to diversify their portfolios and embrace the digital future.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Amid meme coin downturn, experts say PropiChain is a ‘no brainer,’ with 6,600% returns by January and 40,000% by 2025. Table of Contents Dogecoin price prediction: Should someone buy DOGE? Why PCHAIN is the best crypto to buy now over Dogecoin Forget Dogecoin – don’t miss round two of the PropiChain presale With the bearish trend surrounding most meme coins today, including greats like Dogecoin (DOGE) , one prominent analyst says investing in utility tokens like PropiChain (PCHAIN) is a ‘no brainer’. Even crypto experts share this sentiment, pointing out how this bull cycle is fueled by institutions and governments with no interest in inherently valueless tokens. While meme coins like Dogecoin will continue to dominate the market, it’s the PropiChain presale investors are betting big on, anticipating profits upwards 6,600% by January and up to 40,000% by the end of 2025. You might also like: PropiChain’s crypto presale is changing real estate investment unlocking this $300T sector Dogecoin price prediction: Should someone buy DOGE? While Bitcoin (BTC) continued its generational run past $100k to set a new ATH of $108,268 this past week, the meme coin market suffered heavy losses. However, this isn’t a mere coincidence. Dogecoin (DOGE), for example, is down across the past day (3.90%), week (23.88%), and month (17.90%), dropping to $0.3087 today. Experts say investors are liquidating their meme coin assets and diverting funds into altcoins as utility tokens enter the spotlight in this bull run. With the U.S. and many other governments, along with trillion-dollar financial institutions, looking into adding Bitcoin to their holdings, diversifying with major utility altcoins is a smart idea, as big money is expected to flow into the sector. Why PCHAIN is the best crypto to buy now over Dogecoin While many like this analysts were still catching on to PropiChain’s potential, savvy investors were quietly scooping up scare PCHAIN altcoins in round one of its presale , spending over $1.3 million within weeks of opening. Understandably, those who understood how PropiChain could change the industry wasted no time acquiring the tokens at their lowest-ever price. While round one is over, round two is open and offering PCHAIN at $0.011, the cheapest it’ll ever be again. But like many others, someone could probably be wondering, “what is PropiChain and why does it matter?” To put it plainly, PropiChain is the first full-service real estate blockchain solution for property tokenization, asset discovery, real estate transactions, and digital property management that still offers advanced artificial intelligence tools for investors. If someone is wondering how this is all possible on a single platform, it’s because PropiChain is combining blockchain, RWA tokenization, smart contract automation, a metaverse marketplace, and artificial intelligence. Together, these technologies allow PropiChain to effectively address the problems facing real estate today, including global property fraud, high financial barriers, poor market access, and inefficient operational processes for businesses. Starting with the high financial barriers, PropiChain is eliminating them with fractional ownership enabled by RWA tokenization, allowing for physical properties to be traded in unlimited fractions. Now, smaller players can play in the big leagues by investing in the same level of properties with only a fraction of the investment it’ll traditionally take. Then, leave it to advance blockchain and decentralized ledger tech to store assets in an impenetrable vault while providing a transparent record of asset ownership and transaction for everyone to verify, thereby checkmating the annual billion-dollar property fraud market. But PropiChain is more than just an asset tokenization and storage platform; it is a fully-fledged real estate metaverse marketplace, offering users virtual property tours, virtual meetings, and the ability to virtually stage assets to test interior decorations and layouts without paying inspection fees. Already, PropiChain is unmatched, but its inclusion of smart contract automation is setting the platform miles ahead of its competitors. Instead of wasting precious time and money in leasing properties and following up with tenants for rental payments, PropiChain is offering auto leasing, auto-renewals, and auto rent collection features. Whether the Dogecoin winter or make 66x gains in 30 days wth PropiChain After a double-digit decline in the Dogecoin price over the past week and month despite the Bitcoin milestone, investors are more than convinced of the shifting market sentiment. For those seeking the best altcoins to buy now , PropiChain might prove to be a great choice, as the PCHAIN price can skyrocket from $0.011 to $0.732, yielding round-two investors 6,600% by the end of January. Forget Dogecoin – don’t miss round two of the PropiChain presale 2025 is about to begin, and the search for the next millionaire minting altcoin is underway, seeing as the number of crypto millionaires doubled in 2024 alone. Ironically, as meme coins lose momentum, PropiChain is poised to mirror the explosive early Dogecoin price movements. With over $1.7 million raised in the PCHAIN presale so far, investors are indicating their unwillingness to miss the altcoin powering the real estate blockchain movement at $0.011, the lowest price it’ll ever be again. Although investors are excited by PCHAIN’s 400x price projections in 2025 , short-term investors celebrate the most as PropiChain is projected to rise 6,600% in the next 30 days as Trump’s inauguration is set to fuel another major bull run. To be specific, a $1,500 round-two investment can grow to $99,000 in January and up to $600,000 by the end of 2025! Yet, the window to make the maximum gains is already closing fast as the next round quickly approaches. Besides the BlockAudit security audit and CoinMarketCap listing fueling trust and excitement, the early presale success is sending shockwaves in the crypto community and sending traffic like never before. Round two has already sold $432,938, pushing the presale closer and closer to the final round.

This price point is actually a critical support level, according to on-chain data from IntoTheBlock , which highlights how meme coin investors investors have bought in some 362 billion SHIB across 270 addresses at this price point. Descending even further, down to $0.000019, we see some 54,350 transactions involving an eye-watering 53.91 trillion SHIB, valued at approximately $1.19 billion. Conversely, when we go up to $0.000026, we find some 89.47 trillion $SHIB—worth around $2 billion—is held by 119,490 addresses, all of which are of course posting a loss. So, between $0.000019 and $0.000026, we have an imbalance, more specifically, a sell wall of over 35.5 trillion SHIB around the current price, introducing significant resistance. However, in spite of a steep recent drop to below its projected support level over the last three months according, there are signs that the meme coin could rally back above the safe zone of $0.000026. A relative strength index (RSI) of 40 and rising suggests many are buying the dip, and should this continue, $SHIB fans will have lifted it out of the worst of the crisis. The fact that the token has actually added 0.2% in the last 24 hours while its inspiration, Dogecoin ($DOGE), is down 1.6% suggests this may be the case.

Will Donald Trump Deliver On Crypto Executive Order? According to the December 23 article , two unnamed sources with knowledge of the situation confirmed to the media outlet that at least one executive order such as creating a bitcoin stockpile, developing a crypto council, or protected access to digital asset banking services may come that same day. “There has been an effort in the Washing bureaucratic swamp to stifle innovation,” Brian Hughes, a political operative spearheading the New York-born businessman’s transition team, told Reuters in a statement, “but President Trump will deliver on his promise to encourage American leadership in crypto.” Trump, who most recently launched his family’s crypto platform World Liberty Financial, has long vowed to enact crypto-friendly regulations when he returns to the Oval Office. “We will have regulations,” Trump stated at the Bitcoin 2024 Conference this past summer, adding, “but from now on, the rules will be written by the people who love your industry, not hate your industry.” Trump Vows Digital Asset Friendly Approach To Crypto Sector The former reality television star’s promise to be a crypto-friendly president has been largely embraced by the digital asset community following years of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) regulation-by-enforcement approach to digital assets. In the leadup to the 2024 U.S. presidential election, Trump vowed to fire SEC chair Gary Gensler who announced his resignation from the government agency last month. The controversial regulator doled out several high-profile lawsuits against key players in the crypto industry in recent years, including Kraken, Binance and Terraform Labs since his appointment in 2021. The Biden-approved chair is slated to be replaced by Patomak Global Partners CEO and former SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins.

Among larger capped coins, the decentralized finance (DeFi) project Odos (ODOS), with a listing FDV of $193 million, recorded the best performance, gaining 65.88% over the weekend. It was followed at 54.77% by another Solana meme coin, Luce (LUCE), and AICell (AICELL), an AI token on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), whose worth increased by 32.10%. On the flip side, Apx (APX) and Griffain (GRIFFAIN), respectively boasting FDVs of $708.73 million and $242.64 million, suffered the steepest declines. The former blew 28.12% of its value, while the latter followed closely with a 25.41% drop. A couple of popular Solana tokens, ai16z (AI16Z) and Fartcoin (FARTCOIN), also performed poorly, losing 18.53% and 16.38% in that order. Fartcoin, which last week hit a new all-time high (ATH), initially had the biggest FDV of all the tokens listed on Binance Alpha at $862.63 million, with ai16z second at just under $800 million. However, the weekend dips mean they are currently worth $721.36 million and $651 million respectively. Diverse Performances Across Chains and Sectors The 29 tokens were distributed across four public blockchains: BSC, Solana, Ethereum, and Base. Per Sankin’s findings, BSC dominated the listings, accounting for more than 41% of all the assets, while Solana followed with 27.6%. Ethereum and Base split the remaining 31% of listings between them, with the former claiming 17.2% of the projects and Base accounting for 13.8%. The performance also varied significantly by sector. Most of those labeled as AI agents emerged as the top category, representing 31% of the listings, with DeFi and meme tokens tied for second at 27.6% apiece. The remaining 13.8% consisted of smaller categories like decentralized science (DeSci) and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), represented by tokens like Rifampicin ($RIF) and Koge (KOGE).

38014644,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=632441,1734977805,"2025 will see Fed rate hikes, rampant Trump tariffs and a China recession, says Apollo","Apollo Management dropped its 2025 market risk report , and it’s not looking pretty. Fed rate hikes are back on the table, Trump is ready to slap tariffs on half the world, and China’s economy might finally cave under the weight of its deflation crisis. If this plays out, 2025 won’t just be volatile, it’ll be a financial minefield. Trump’s potential tariffs lead the charge. Apollo gives them a 90% chance of happening. The targets? Everyone. Canada and Mexico could see 25% slapped on their exports. BRICS countries like China, Brazil, Russia, and South Africa might face up to 100% tariffs. Apollo says these tariffs could knock 1.7% off U.S. GDP, but tax cuts are expected to offset the hit with a 2.4% boost. Nvidia’s bubble, inflation’s comeback, and the Fed’s dilemma Nvidia, the darling of the AI boom, might crash back to Earth. Apollo warns there’s a 90% chance the company’s earnings will miss Wall Street’s sky-high expectations. After driving 20% of the S&P 500’s gains in 2024, Nvidia’s shine is fading. Even hitting targets in Q3 didn’t trigger a rally, and 2025 looks even tougher. Apollo isn’t optimistic. Inflation is the other big story. It’s clawing back into the spotlight after months of cooling. Apollo sees a 40% chance that inflation will heat up in Q1 2025. Core CPI’s annualized 3-month rate is already above 3.5%. CPI, PCE, and PPI are all climbing. The Fed has noticed. It’s trimmed its rate cut forecast for 2025 from three to just two, totaling 50 basis points. Apollo believes rate hikes are back on the table with a 40% probability. This would hit crypto and stock markets alike, igniting new volatility. The Fed might also abandon its beloved r-star framework, according to Apollo. The real neutral interest rate, which balances economic growth and inflation, has been a guiding star for years. Apollo assigns a 70% chance the Fed pivots away from it in 2025, showing uncertainty about their long-term strategy. China’s economic nightmare and America’s resilience China’s economy is circling the drain. Apollo sees a 40% chance the country enters a full-blown recession. It’s not hard to see why. Deflation has gripped the economy for five straight quarters—the worst streak since 1999. Stimulus measures? Useless so far. The property sector, a cornerstone of China’s growth, is crumbling. If Beijing can’t stabilize things, the global economy will be caught in the disaster. The U.S., on the other hand, is flexing its muscles. Apollo gives a 0% chance of a U.S. recession in 2025. GDP growth ended 2024 at 2.8% and is expected to hold at 2.3% next year. Inflation remains above the Fed’s 2% target but isn’t spiraling out of control. Employment numbers are strong too. November saw 227,000 new jobs added, bouncing back from October’s hurricane disruptions. The unemployment rate is expected to tick up slightly to 4.4% by the end of 2025, but the labor market remains resilient. Corporate America is cashing in on the AI boom. Companies are pouring money into AI infrastructure, chips, and intellectual property. Bankruptcies and defaults are down, thanks to low-interest rates locked in during earlier Fed cycles. Trump’s comeback and geopolitical chaos Trump’s policies are expected to shake up everything. Apollo warns his agenda—lower taxes, higher tariffs, and stricter immigration rules—could fuel inflation, strengthen the dollar, and send markets into a tailspin. Geopolitical risks add another to the uncertainty. The wars in Ukraine and the Middle East show no signs of resolution. Rising U.S.-China tensions could spill over into global trade. Apollo notes that the federal deficit, currently at 6% of GDP, leaves little room for error. Long-term interest rates might stay high for years, complicating the fiscal outlook even more. Debt is another problem. The U.S. government’s spending spree, from the CHIPS Act to the Inflation Reduction Act, has fueled growth but also boosted the deficit. Apollo cautions that a rushed Fed pivot could reignite inflation, undermining years of progress. Markets are pricing in a 25% chance of a U.S. recession in 2025, but that number could rise if policymakers miscalculate. The 10-year yield and consumer resilience The U.S. 10-year Treasury note yield is a wildcard. Apollo predicts a 40% chance it will climb above 5% by mid-2025. This would be a nightmare for bond markets and could trigger broader sell-offs. The yield has already jumped 100 basis points since the Fed began pivoting in 2024. Another spike would hit equities, real estate, and crypto markets hard. Consumers, however, are holding steady—for now. Spending grew 3.7% in Q3, and confidence is high. The Consumer Confidence Index hit 111.7 in November, with short-term expectations also rising. Apollo expects spending to moderate in 2025, dropping to 2% growth, but this resilience has been a key driver of the economy’s strength.

Recent blockchain data reveals that these deep-pocketed investors are accumulating a lesser-known altcoin, PCHAIN, drawing attention from analysts and retail traders alike. This altcoin, tipped by top market analysts to outperform Shiba Inu ( SHIB ), has steadily gained traction within the crypto community due to its growing adoption and solid fundamentals. As top market analysts project the altcoin will surpass Shiba Inu by January 2025, the token presale is witnessing an influx of investors. This accumulation by Ethereum whales comes at a time when market conditions favour early positioning in emerging assets. As Shiba Inu and other memecoins face challenges in maintaining their upward momentum, this altcoin, PCHAIN, stands out for offering more than just hype; it promises utility and massive gains. For Ethereum whales, whose investment decisions often set trends, this move signals confidence in the PCHAIN’s future potential. Why the Ethereum Whales’ Actions Matter Ethereum whales have historically played an essential role in shaping market dynamics. Their investment decisions often signal confidence in a specific project or technology, leading to increased interest and adoption. With their deep pockets and long-term vision, these investors are known for carefully vetting assets before committing substantial capital. If such investors are quietly accumulating this altcoin poised to outpace Shiba Inu, we all need to pay attention to that asset. PCHAIN Combining The Shiba Inu Appeal With Tangible Utility The Shiba Inu rise in 2021 was nothing short of extraordinary. Referred by many as the “Dogecoin killer,” it rode the wave of social media hype and retail investor enthusiasm to deliver astronomical returns of over 4,000%. However, its reliance on speculation and community-driven momentum meant its long-term viability was in question. For Ethereum whales to have confidence that this emerging altcoin will outperform Shiba Inu, then the token must combine the viral appeal of memecoins with tangible utility and real-world adoption. This is where this PCHAIN stands out. Unlike memecoins like Shiba Inu, which often rely wholly on speculative hype, this token’s ecosystem is rooted in solving real problems facing the global real estate market. Providing solutions to the problems bedevilling a $600 trillion market means massive adoption of such solutions. Why Ethereum Whales are Betting Big on PCHAIN Several factors explain why Ethereum whales are accumulating this altcoin, and they include the following: Utility and Adoption Unlike memecoins, which thrive on hype, utility-driven tokens like PCHAIN gain value as they attract more users to their platforms. These Ethereum Whales see this altcoin as a long-term investment in the real estate market. As an RWA token, PCHAIN bridges the gap between real estate assets and the blockchain. Real estate is estimated to be the largest part of the $16 trillion RWA tokenization market, and PCHAIN’s value is poised to skyrocket. Market Position PCHAIN’s market capitalization and circulating supply indicate room for significant growth, making it an attractive opportunity compared to already-saturated assets like Shiba Inu. This is a big motivating factor to the Ethereum whales, who see this as a low-risk, high-reward opportunity. Technological Edge PropiChain, the parent project of PCHAIN, uses a combination of technological innovations, such as the Metaverse, smart contracts, AI, and RWA tokenization technology, to power the future of global real estate. This altcoin pioneering advancement in the $600 trillion real estate market opens up an investment opportunity that is hard to ignore. Application of PropiChain’s Innovative Technologies to Power the Future of Global Real Estate PropiChain is redefining the global real estate landscape by incorporating advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), the Metaverse, tokenization of Real World Assets (RWA), and smart contracts. Through its AI-powered virtual assistants and chatbots, the platform delivers 24/7 personalized support to real estate investors at every stage of their investment process. Its sophisticated predictive AI tools assess future market trends to provide actionable insights, helping investors spot opportunities and maintain a strategic advantage. Additionally, using the Metaverse, PropiChain integrates virtual reality and 3D technology to offer global property exploration without requiring physical site visits. This innovative feature eliminates the need for frequent travel, breaking down geographic limitations and enabling a more convenient property scouting experience for investors. PropiChain’s RWA tokenization technology revolutionizes real estate by digitizing properties on the blockchain. This allows for fractional ownership, making it possible for investors with smaller budgets to own a part of high-value properties. This groundbreaking approach democratizes premium real estate investments, making them accessible to a broader audience and expanding opportunities for individuals previously excluded from this market. Furthermore, PropiChain employs smart contract technology to optimize property management. Processes such as drafting and renewing lease agreements are automated, reducing reliance on intermediaries, cutting costs, and improving efficiency. Conclusion Ethereum whales accumulating PCHAIN only means one thing: the project’s growth potential is massive. Tipped to outperform Shiba Inu, analysts project a 43, 715% growth by January 2025. PCHAIN’s token presale is ongoing, and the 43,715% projection means your early $1000 investment could yield $427,150. By the end of this presale round, the price will increase from its current value of $0.011 to $0.023, an over 109% increase. Join the PCHAIN presale now for a low price entry and a potential mouth-watering profit margin. BlockAudit , a top blockchain security company, audited PCHAIN’s smart contract and found no vulnerability. The token is listed on CoinMarketCap , reiterating the project’s resolve to break boundaries and make huge profits for its early investors.

38013934,https://nulltx.com/?p=136241,1734976826,Are Utility Tokens the New Kings? Crypto Giants Swap Meme Coins for Web3Bay & Ethena,"The Rise of Utility Coins: Ethena & Web3Bay Take the Lead as Crypto Whales Divest from GOAT With a staggering 85% of major retailers now accepting cryptocurrencies, there’s a seismic shift happening. Trump’s recent victory is poised to accelerate crypto adoption further, with savvy investors moving their focus to utility tokens, sidelining meme coins like GOAT. Web3Bay is at the forefront, revolutionizing decentralized e-commerce by empowering users with control over their data and transactions through cutting-edge blockchain technology. Its 3BAY token isn’t just for purchases—it also grants governance rights, giving the community significant sway over the platform’s direction. By supporting both cryptocurrency and mainstream options like PayPal, Web3Bay is bridging the old and new financial worlds, attracting a wide user base. Starting with a presale price of just $0.003 per token, Web3Bay teases a thrilling 6000% ROI as it progresses through 28 pricing stages. Volatility Strikes Goatseus Maximus (GOAT) The AI-enhanced meme coin, Goatseus Maximus (GOAT), is riding a rollercoaster of market fluctuations. After hitting a high of $0.88 post-Binance listing, it has tumbled roughly 32% from that peak. A 48% drop in trading volume in just two days hints at upcoming price adjustments—a common trend in the volatile crypto market. Current technical metrics show the Relative Strength Index (RSI) nearing 70, exiting the overbought zone, signaling possible sell-offs and a forthcoming price dip. Despite these tremors, GOAT holds a market cap near $448 million with almost 1 billion coins circulating. Ethena’s (ENA) Robust Market Performance Ethena is making waves with a 6.19% rise in the last 24 hours and a whopping 44.18% increase over the week, pushing its price to $0.916. This growth spurt has boosted its market cap to an impressive $1.47 billion, with 2.8 billion ENA tokens in circulation. This bullish run is partly fueled by the announcement of a new stablecoin project, UStb (USTB), a collaboration between Ethena Labs, BlackRock, and Securitize, aiming to launch a stablecoin backed by a tokenized BlackRock fund. This adds substantial credibility and allure, enticing more investors. Technical patterns suggest ENA might be on the cusp of breaking out from a bearish downtrend. Why Web3Bay is Set to Revolutionize E-commerce with Over 6000% ROI Potential Web3Bay is on track to revolutionize the online shopping world, potentially outpacing giants like Amazon as it harnesses the explosive growth of cryptocurrency adoption. Unlike the usual e-commerce platforms, Web3Bay operates on a completely decentralized blockchain platform, ensuring that every user has total control over their data, privacy, and money. This revolutionary model is transforming online shopping for those who value tight security and clear transparency in their buying experiences. At the heart of Web3Bay is the dynamic 3BAY token, which does a lot more than just handle payments. It unlocks access to exclusive discounts, enticing rewards, and crucial governance rights, putting the community in charge of the platform’s future. Web3Bay also cleverly merges traditional payment methods like PayPal with cryptocurrency, catering to a broad spectrum of shoppers. Web3Bay’s presale is now live, offering the 3BAY token for just $0.003, with an expected price surge of 15% at each of the 28 stages. Projected to soar to $0.1959 by the final stage, early investors could see a staggering ROI of over 6000%. As cryptocurrencies become mainstream, Web3Bay is setting itself up as the definitive future of shopping, combining an unbeatable mix of incentives, security features, and user-driven innovation. Wrapping Up As the tide turns towards tokens with genuine utility, Web3Bay is capturing the spotlight with its revolutionary approach to e-commerce. While GOAT wrestles with market instability and Ethena secures powerful partnerships, Web3Bay stands out for its commitment to user empowerment, security, and seamless integration of crypto and traditional payment systems. Built on a foundation of decentralization, Web3Bay offers governance rights, exclusive perks, and a transparent, privacy-focused shopping experience. Its presale, aimed at cultivating a dedicated base of early supporters, promises a potential 6000% ROI, setting the stage for a transformative impact on digital commerce.

38014052,https://blockworks.co/news/hyperliquid-security-fuels-decentralization-concerns,1734976800,Hyperliquid under scrutiny amid signs of North Korean hacker activity,"This is a segment from the 0xResearch newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . “You either die a hero, or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain.” — Harvey Dent For Hyperliquid, it took all of 25 days since its highly acclaimed airdrop to run into a bout of controversy. It started when Taylor Monahan ( @tayvano ), a security researcher at MetaMask, sounded the alarm on a series of Hyperliquid transactions made from North Korea-tagged wallets. Based on Monahan’s data, the wallets have accrued a $701k loss from ETH perps positions. It’s a meager amount for a state-sponsored hacker group. But what got people in an uproar was the revelation that North Korea hackers were actively familiarizing themselves with the Hyperliquid platform, presumably to launch an impending hack. Hyperliquid chain’s highly centralized validator set of four made it extra vulnerable to a potential hack, Monahan claims. There are no more than 4 validators and all run the same code, possibly collocated as well. Centralized infra, build systems, etc. maintained and accessed by unknown number of founders, c-levels, and engjneers who use the same devices to access said systems as they do to talk to… — Tay 💖 (@tayvano_) December 23, 2024 Hyperliquid’s liquidity is locked in a lock-and-mint style bridge from Arbitrum, where Hyperliquid used to exist as a perps DEX application. When Hyperliquid migrated to its own Tendermint -consensus PoS L1 chain in March 2024, the team retained the lock-and-mint style bridge from Arbitrum, which remains the only way to onboard onto Hyperliquid today. Based on Dune, the deposit bridge has seen a record high net outflow of $114.7m in USDC liquidity in the past day, though that is still a fraction of the remaining $2.22b in TVL. Source: Dune Talks of a Hyperliquid hack are merely speculative at this time, but if one happened, here’s a rough sketch of how it would play out. Everyone wanted Hyperliquid to respond to the allegations of an impending hack, so here it is. TDLR: there is no exploit, all funds are safu. If a vulnerability is found, the team is always willing to listen as they have a bug bounty program. pic.twitter.com/VHYeUogvxs — steven.hl (@stevenyuntcap) December 23, 2024 To successfully attack Hyperliquid’s bridge contract would require three out of its four validators to be compromised, as per a two-thirds quorum. Should that happen, the natively minted USDC on Arbitrum could theoretically be frozen by Circle before the hackers were able to swap the stolen funds into an uncensorable asset like ETH. That, however, requires Circle to act on issued court orders, a tedious and slow legal process that may offer the time sophisticated hackers need to execute an exit. The hacker may instead choose to try and swap to USDC.e (Ethereum-native USDC tokens that were bridged to Arbitrum) onto the Ethereum L1. “The only plausible path that would enable the Arbitrum security council as a line of defense would be if the hackers attempted to withdraw the funds through the canonical bridge, likely after swapping to ETH,” Matt Fiebach at Entropy Advisors told Blockworks. “In this scenario, the elected Arbitrum Security would need to make the decision of whether effectively blocking this transfer was within their scope of ‘addressing critical risks associated with the Arbitrum protocol and its ecosystem’.” Finally, it’s also worth noting that a hacker would have trouble finding the necessary liquidity venues to swap out of the stolen funds. $2 billion of liquidity would have to be spread across a variety of third-party bridges, which would cause massive slippages.

In a new filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), enterprise software company MicroStrategy says the number of its board members has increased to nine. “On December 20, 2024, the Board of Directors (the ‘Board’) of MicroStrategy Incorporated (the ‘Company’), upon recommendation from the Nominating Committee of the Board, expanded the size of the Board from six to nine members.” The firm says the board elected Meridian Capital Group CEO and former Acting Comptroller of the Currency Brian Brooks, Brown University chief investment officer Jane Dietze and Fanatics Holdings chief legal officer Gregg Winiarski as new members. Brooks, Dietze and Winiarksi will be eligible to receive equity awards under the MicroStrategy Incorporated 2023 Equity Incentive Plan. They are also entitled to compensation and other personal benefits for non-employee directors. MicroStrategy expanded the size of its board as it continues to stockpile Bitcoin. Earlier this month, the company bought an additional 15,350 BTC. The acquisition brings MicroStrategy’s total Bitcoin holdings to 439,000 BTC valued at around $41 billion based on the flagship cryptocurrency’s current price of $94,451. The firm’s co-founder, Michael Saylor, says Bitcoin is emerging as the “world’s reserve capital network”. He says the US should accumulate BTC to cement its global financial dominance.

The U.S. Court of Appeals has set deadlines for the case. Ripple must submit a mediation questionnaire by December 23, 2024, and an opening brief by March 6, 2025. Ripple must respond to the brief by April 7, 2025. However, a potential U.S. government shutdown could cause delays in the case. Ripple is still hopeful the case might be dropped, but some critics, like former SEC official John Reed Stark, believe the Ripple ruling creates confusion. He thinks it doesn’t protect retail investors enough and could affect how cryptocurrency companies argue their tokens aren’t securities. However, XRP enthusiasts are confused and eager about how long the case might continue. Former SEC lawyer Marc Fagel wrote on social media, “The appeal will continue for now, and that process takes about a year. But there is the possibility that a new administration decides to move to dismiss the appeal. That’s not something I recall happening before, but it’s possible and maybe likely.” Stark also warns of a major clash between Trump’s administration and Gary Gensler’s SEC picks. Stark describes Gensler’s recent promotions as part of a “deep state crusade” to secure influence before leaving office. Stark predicts that Atkins’ team will move quickly to dismantle crypto investigations. SEC Prepares For A Shutdown? On December 13, 2024, the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance issued guidance to help companies prepare for a possible shutdown.A government shutdown could make the legal case more complicated, causing delays in decisions and adding pressure on everyone involved.

38013929,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=632415,1734976383,AI hype drives Apple toward $4 trillion market cap,"Apple is on fire. The company is closing in on a historic $4 trillion valuation, riding a wave of investor excitement over its long-overdue artificial intelligence (AI) upgrades. A 16% stock surge since early November has added $500 billion to its market cap, putting Apple leagues ahead of competitors Nvidia and Microsoft in the race to hit this insane milestone. At $3.85 trillion, Apple’s worth is so massive it overshadows the combined value of Germany and Switzerland’s entire stock markets. This rally is powered by what analysts are calling an “iPhone supercycle,” driven by AI integrations that promise to rejuvenate sluggish iPhone sales. Investors are betting big that these upgrades will spark a new wave of consumer demand. “Artificial intelligence is the magic word here,” said Tom Forte of Maxim Group. But Apple’s slow approach to AI has left many wondering if the company is playing catch-up. Apple’s AI strategy finally takes shape For years, Apple has been accused of sleeping on AI while its rivals ran ahead. Nvidia, for instance, has seen its stock explode by over 800% in just two years, while Apple’s shares merely doubled. But the tide may be turning. In December, Apple finally rolled out OpenAI’s ChatGPT integration into its devices, following its June announcement to infuse generative AI across its ecosystem. This comes after a lot of pressure to prove that Apple is more than just iPhones and AirPods. The company’s AI push is seen as critical to its future, and the timing couldn’t be better. Analysts believe these upgrades could start a massive handset replacement cycle, with Morgan Stanley pointing to 2026 as the year AI could drive double-digit services growth and expand gross margins. The analysts call Apple their “top pick” for 2025, citing improving iPhone demand as AI features and availability grow. And with services revenue growing faster than products, Apple’s gross margins are expected to expand by 50 basis points annually over the next three years. Stock momentum, trade risks, and Trump’s tariffs Apple’s meteoric rise has pushed its price-to-earnings ratio to a three-year high of 33.5. That’s higher than Nvidia’s 31.7 and Microsoft’s 31.3. But this valuation isn’t sitting well with everyone. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, which holds Apple as its largest investment, has sold shares this year, citing concerns over stretched valuations. Adding to the drama, there’s a wildcard in the form of Donald Trump. The President-elect has promised to slap a 10% tariff on goods from China. Given Apple’s reliance on Chinese manufacturing, this could be a problem. Analysts, though, think Apple might dodge the worst of it. “We believe exclusions are likely for products like iPhones and Macs, just like in 2018,” said Morgan Stanley. Still, Apple’s shares took a hit last Wednesday after the Federal Reserve announced a slower pace of rate cuts for next year. Tech stocks wobbled, but analysts believe easing monetary policy in the long run will keep the market propped up. Morgan Stanley has set a $273 per share price target, implying another 10% upside from current levels. The bank predicts Apple could drive over $8.50 in earnings per share by fiscal year 2026. And investors seem willing to bet on Apple’s ability to deliver. The company has advanced 29% in 2024, outpacing the S&P 500’s 27% gain. And despite concerns over high valuations, 35 out of 49 analysts covering Apple rate it a buy or strong buy.

Plus, there are more rewards down the line — users can grow your profits as the referrals bring in even more users. Toncoin (TON): Cryptocurrency of the decentralized open network Toncoin (TON) is the native cryptocurrency of The Open Network, a decentralized, open-source layer-1 blockchain supported by the TON Foundation and community contributors. Initially developed by Telegram as Telegram Open Network with the ‘Gram’ token, the project was discontinued in May 2020 following an SEC court order. Renamed and continued by the community, Toncoin operates on a proof-of-stake consensus model, enhancing scalability and reliability. It aims to provide fast, secure payment services with minimal fees and develop an ecosystem including decentralized storage, services, DNS, anonymous networking, and efficient payment processing. Based on historical price movements and BTC halving cycles, Toncoin shows potential for growth, suggesting attractiveness in the current market cycle. Aptos: A scalable blockchain focusing on safety and flexibility Aptos (APT) is a new blockchain designed to address high transaction fees and network congestion found in systems like Ethereum before its Proof-of-Stake transition. Developed by Aptos Labs, founded by key contributors from Meta’s Diem project, it employs a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. Aptos uses the Move programming language for smart contracts, highlighting safety, scalability, and flexibility. It supports a wide range of web3 applications. With its strong development team and focus on solving existing blockchain issues, Aptos has significant potential. In the current market cycle, its innovative approach to scalability and security may make it an attractive option for users and developers. UNI Token: Governance power in Uniswap’s decentralized exchange Uniswap’s UNI token, launched in September 2020, is a governance token that enables holders to vote on developments within the Uniswap platform, such as fee structures and token distribution. The token was introduced to foster user loyalty in response to competition from platforms like SushiSwap, with 150 million UNI tokens distributed to past users, each receiving 400 tokens. Uniswap is a leading decentralized exchange on Ethereum , providing an automated liquidity protocol that allows trading without an order book and full user control over funds. As one of the largest DeFi platforms with significant assets, UNI’s integration in a growing decentralized ecosystem suggests potential attractiveness in the current market cycle. Jupiter: Leading DeFi platform on Solana with expanding features Jupiter (JUP) is a prominent platform in Decentralised Finance on the Solana blockchain. It is the most popular DEX aggregator globally, pooling resources to enable efficient token swaps, futures trading, and decentralised stablecoin management. Originally focused on liquidity aggregation for token swaps, Jupiter has expanded to include perpetual futures similar to GMX. It is also launching its own decentralised stablecoin to reduce custodial and regulatory risks. Jupiter’s growth and innovations suggest strong potential in the DeFi space. In the current market cycle, its expanding services and position on Solana may make it an attractive option for users interested in decentralised finance. Conclusion While coins like TON, APT, UNI, and JUP may have limited short-term potential, DOGEN stands out by appealing to those who seek luxury and success. Expected to grow significantly by the end of its presale, DOGEN follows the path of successful tokens like BONK and Popcat, aiming to build a community of leaders and offer real benefits to early supporters.

The firm’s analysis is based on two key on-chain metrics that point to increased activity among this group of investors, which Alphractal analysts argue points to a potentially major sell-off. Reserve Risk Indicators VOCDD & MVOCDD: These metrics analyze the rate of coin destruction and compare the current price of Bitcoin with the average purchase cost of LTH, giving an idea about the sustainability of the market. Reserve Risk: This indicator offers clues about market sentiment by assessing whether Bitcoin is overbought or oversold. MVOCDD Signal: A tool used to identify market tops and indicate when Bitcoin may be nearing its peak. Fixed Terminal Destroyed Coin Days (CDD Terminal Fixed) This refined metric adjusts traditional Coin Days Destroyed calculations to account for Bitcoin’s circulating supply, highlighting significant movements or periods of inactivity to provide a clearer perspective on LTH’s activity. Related News: Watch Out: 25 Altcoins to Experience Massive Token Unlocking in Calm Week - Here's the Day-by-Day, Hour-by-Hour List Historically, LTH has benefited from Bitcoin price rallies by selling, especially when average purchase costs are significantly lower than current market prices, according to the analyst firm. This profit-taking behavior often creates local resistance levels that can suppress Bitcoin’s upward momentum for weeks or even months. According to the analytics firm, even if BTC continues to rise in the near future, data suggests that LTH no longer has much interest in holding its assets, which could shape market dynamics in 2025. *This is not investment advice.

38014521,https://cryptonews.com/?p=322037,1734976277,Why Are Cryptos Crashing? Are Traders Selling Their Cryptos to Buy Christmas Gifts?,"The ongoing market-wide crypto price crash has many investors, old and new, wondering what’s happening and when it will end. Are traders liquidating their portfolios to fund Christmas shopping and holiday expenses? It’s a bitter pill to swallow after Bitcoin recently hit six figures for the first time in history and is projected to double next year . The festive season typically brings an increase in consumer spending to cover gifts, travel, and other holiday-related costs. For traders who have recently profited from crypto investments, selling digital assets could provide quick liquidity without needing to borrow or dip into savings. However, the truth of crypto’s latest crash is more likely to be related to macroeconomic pressures that have rocked the market since the Federal Reserve’s December 18 meeting. How The Fed Crashed Crypto Prices After the Fed’s last meeting, Jerome Powell announced the US central bank was cutting rates by 25 basis points for the third time in a row after hiking them by the same amount eleven times. Normally, reducing borrowing costs tends to drive crypto prices up since investors move to a more risk-positive outlook. However, at the same Fed meeting that announced the rate cut, Powell also put a dampener on claims that the incoming Trump Presidency could stockpile a Bitcoin strategic reserve through the central bank, saying that currently, federal laws forbid it from doing so, but a Congressional decision could still make it happen. He also said that while inflation has begun to cool, it remains above the Fed’s 2% target. He cautioned that the Fed’s policy rate is, for now, “meaningfully restrictive” and that future rate cuts would depend on “further progress on inflation.” It wasn’t just crypto that was affected, stocks tumbled after the meeting too. Bitcoin ($BTC) is leading the crypto crash. As we can see below, everyone follows the market leader, who has been in free fall since the announcement. Its relative strength index (RSI) is currently 37 and falling and has spent most of the last five days below 50, indicating heavy and continued selling pressure. Source: TradingView It’s unclear how long this state of affairs will continue, but many are hoping some post-Christmas dip-buying, together with preparations for pro-crypto Donald Trump taking office, should help the market recover. Best Wallet makes traders more resilient While money exits the mainstream crypto market and crashes prices, investors appear to be channeling it into cutting edge projects that are still only in presale.

Daddy Pepe (DADDPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 11,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DADDPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Daddy Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Daddy Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Daddy Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Daddy Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Daddy Pepe by entering its contract address – 9UFnMabUe7wecdEEzAYPoQPZiuTJ1hTFpNz6qtsiB3FA – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DADDPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/daddy-pepe-daddpepe-solana-memecoin-will-surge-11000-ahead-of-exchange-listing-as-shib-wif-and-doge-underperform/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png
38014520,https://cryptonews.com/?p=322156,1734976237,Nokia Files Patent for Digital Asset Encryption Device and Program,"Nokia, the Finnish telecommunications giant, has taken a significant step into digital asset security. The company has filed a patent for a “device, method, and computer program” designed to encrypt digital assets. China’s National Intellectual Property Administration (CNIPA), the country’s official patent office, disclosed the patent application on December 23. Nokia’s Digital Asset Encryption Device: How Big Is This Coming? The company reportedly filed the patent under the title “ Device method and computer program ” on December 23, 2024. This submission follows an earlier application to the National Intellectual Property Administration in June 2024, identified under publication number CN 119155674 A. Nokia files patent for a digital asset encryption device, signaling a move into blockchain security. pic.twitter.com/VcxnngDlxe — cryptothedoggy (@cryptothedoggy) December 23, 2024 According to translated details, the patent describes a device and program capable of encrypting digital assets through indexes linked to encryption processes. While specifics remain unclear, the filing indicates Nokia’s interest in developing specialized tools for securing digital assets. The company has not provided further details regarding the patent. Encryption remains critical in safeguarding cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, where private keys ensure only authorized users can manage their holdings. Nokia’s proposed system aims to strengthen this protection through an innovative encryption method. According to the patent abstract, the system uses a “first key” to encrypt digital assets. This key forms the core of the encryption process and can potentially leverage symmetric or asymmetric encryption. Symmetric systems use a single key for both encryption and decryption, while asymmetric systems employ a public/private key pair to enhance security. Nokia’s history of innovation in networking and telecommunications makes it a worthy candidate for this new product. The company’s extensive patent portfolio spans multiple domains, including 5G networks, IoT, and digital asset encryption. Nokia’s Blockchain Push Reflects Broader Telecom Industry Trends This move is not Nokia’s first venture into blockchain technology. In 2021, the company launched the Nokia Data Marketplace. The platform, built on permissioned blockchain technology, facilitates secure data transactions and analysis. It offers controlled access to its network for pre-approved participants, which marks its first success in integrating blockchain into enterprise solutions. Nokia has also explored applications in the metaverse. In 2023, it collaborated on a project involving a 5G-connected microbrewery . This initiative allowed researchers in Germany and Australia to use augmented reality (AR) and digital simulations to improve brewing techniques. Earlier this year, Nokia outlined plans to upgrade its network infrastructure to meet rising demand. With network traffic projected to increase by 22–25% by 2030, the company is investing in its equipment and services portfolio to support emerging markets and innovations. Nokia’s interest in digital assets follows industry trends. Globally, telecom companies are increasingly investing in blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies. Taiwan Mobile , the country’s second-largest telecom operator, secured a Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) license in July 2024. This license allows the company to operate a digital asset exchange. In South Korea, SK Telecom (SKT) , the largest mobile operator, is preparing to launch a cryptocurrency wallet. The company’s Web3 business team aims to foster growth in South Korea’s crypto market.

The analyst has remarked that the current reversal not only concerns just Bitcoin, but gold and other risk assets as well. However, due to its elevated volatility, Bitcoin has been hit the hardest. Mc Glone noted that the current major Bitcoin drawdown, aside from the volatility was “Just a bit of normal reversion.” Bitcoin is currently trading at $93,260, down over 2% in the past day. In the last week, it shed approximately 14% as it collapsed from the $108,300 level. Market Crash Ahead? The Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki in a latest X post has hinted that the global crash of economies and financial markets has started. He shared that another depression might be on the horizon and advised his followers to be ‘smarter with their money’ and hold on to their jobs and sources of income. He remarked that regardless of which way the economy goes, ‘gold, silver, and Bitcoin hold their value.’ He also shared that for most people, crashes are the best times to get rich. “I plan on getting richer. I want you to get richer and smarter too,” he shared. BTC Crash Concerns Besides, A recent report from The Kobeissi Letter hints at a potential BTC crash by $20,000 in the coming few weeks. The report noted Bitcoin’s relation with the global monetary supply, saying that if the crypto continues to move in tandem, it could see a massive dip ahead. Notably, this prediction comes amid heightened market volatility, with BTC recently dropping below the psychological $100K mark. Is Bitcoin overdue for a correction? In the past, #Bitcoin prices have followed global money supply with ~10 week lag.

38014519,https://cryptonews.com/?p=322070,1734975694,Massive 90 Million XRP Move by Ripple Leaves Investors Worried – Is a Crash Coming?,"A large movement of Ripple (XRP) tokens from the project’s main wallet to an unknown recipient is raising eyebrows within the crypto community as it could result in further weakness in the token’s price down the road. A total of 90 million XRP tokens were sent to wallets rGBvEZnsKB7EvqA2ZZEXRgdwDMn9G9aBk2 and rDK26ASe17eR4ZJafRzgJxeSJNwAhziAee on December 21. At the time, these assets were valued at nearly $202 million. 50,000,000 #XRP (111,697,462 USD) transferred from #Ripple to unknown wallet https://t.co/nWwkUGOhWA — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) December 21, 2024 40,000,000 #XRP (89,678,944 USD) transferred from #Ripple to unknown wallet https://t.co/YmHOFWz1q9 — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) December 21, 2024 Although this represents just a tiny fraction of the token’s average daily trading volume of $11.4 billion, it is still a cause of concern that the project’s main wallet is sending such a large amount to an unknown recipient. Typically, this means that the project is taking out XRP tokens from cold storage and moving them to a hot wallet to sell the assets if or as needed. This move coincides with the launch of Ripple USD (RLUSD), which has led to speculation that the project’s treasury is exchanging XRP for fiat to provide liquid reserves to the stablecoin. RLUSD is already available on multiple global crypto exchanges and is considered a major milestone for Ripple’s ecosystem now that they have settled their turf with the United States Securities and Exchange (SEC) in court. The stablecoin is already available on various exchanges including Uphold, MoonPay, CoinMENA, and Bitso and may soon be offered and listed by Bitstamp, and Bullish according to a statement from the project’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse. RLUSD offers fully-backed USD reserves audited monthly by third parties, multi-chain support, and cross-border payments via DeFi applications and other similar integrations. XRP Finds Footing at $1.95 as Selling Spree Seems to be Slowing Down Although the XRP token has been swept into the market’s recent pullback, its performance during the year has been outstanding, delivering gains of 254% to investors since 2024 started, according to data from CoinMarketCap. This makes XRP the best-performing asset among the top 10 most valuable cryptocurrencies. These gains have been primarily fueled by Donald Trump’s victory in the November presidential election as his pro-crypto views are considered a tailwind to the entire sector and especially to a U.S.-based project like Ripple. Moreover, the project’s court victory over the SEC, which was finally settled with a $125 million fine, and the resignation of Gary Gensler as the agency’s boss were also interpreted as positive catalysts for XRP. From a technical standpoint, the outlook for Ripple continues to be positive despite the latest pullback. The price action has shown that there’s strong support at the $1.95 level and, although it broke its trend line support, this could just be a mere take-profits move from early buyers who benefitted from the post-election rally. As long as that horizontal support holds, the short-term projection for Ripple is positive. Trading volumes have been subsiding as well, which could mean that sellers are running out of ammo. Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows that Ripple (XRP) has already stepped off oversold territory. This much-needed breather could give late buyers the chance to enter a long position at a more favorable price. The macro tailwinds that favored the performance of XRP this year continue to be in place while the launch of RLUSD could also increase network activity – which typically leads to a short-term increase in the value of the blockchain’s native token.

This holiday gesture, which rewards early supporters of the Moca Network, has fueled investor optimism. This has led to a surge in the token’s value, pushing it to new heights and drawing renewed attention to Animoca’s decentralized Web3 ecosystem. Animoca Brands and And Growing MOCA Value Yat Siu’s MOCA tokens distribution is in two stages. The first stage focuses on rewarding early post-engagers from July’s initial announcement. The second stage invites the broader Moca community to contribute creative engagement ideas. Sui’s announcement pushed the MOCA’s price by 15%. This marked a significant uptick as the token continued its impressive monthly growth. This came on the heels of a massive 350% rise in the token’s value last week. Following its listings on major exchanges like Binance, Upbit, and Bithumb. Currently trading at $0.288, MOCA boasts a market cap of $459 million, with a 24-hour trading volume of $620 million. This surge in price signals strong investor confidence and a growing belief in the token’s role in the evolving Web3 space. In July, the Web3 platform aimed for 2,000 retweets on his X post, but the goal was unmet. Sui emphasized that the giveaway is not just a festive gesture. It is a move to solidify the project’s community-driven spirit further. Mocaverse and Web3 Synergy: Bridging Digital Realms The excitement around the giveaway highlights the Moca Network’s potential and its flagship product, Mocaverse. This product enables users to manage and control their identities, monetize data, and interact across Web2 and Web3 environments. This initiative aims to reshape how digital identities are handled in Web3. The recent announcement also comes alongside the rollout of Moca 3.0, the network’s latest upgrade. Moca 3.0 improves the functionality of the entire network, making it more seamless and user-centric. Mocaverse remains the platform where users engage with these features. What’s Next for MOCA and the Moca Network? December 27 will see the unlocking of 692K MOCA tokens. While this represents a relatively small percentage of the total supply, token unlocks tend to catch the market’s attention and could influence short-term sentiment. As the network continues to build its decentralized infrastructure , MOCA is emerging as a key driver of the ecosystem’s success. Remarkably, its potential to bridge Web2 and Web3 is becoming increasingly clear.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Dogecoin eyes $2, but Lightchain AI aims for $10, offering 30,000x returns with AI-driven unique features. Table of Contents Dogecoin’s path to $2- meme coin mania or real value? Lightchain AI- aiming for $10 and 30,000x growth potential Comparative analysis: Dogecoin vs. Lightchain AI in 2024 Why Lightchain AI might outshine Dogecoin in long-term gains Here’s the chance Dogecoin targets $2, but Lightchain AI eyes $10 with 30,000x return potential Dogecoin (DOGE) is making waves as it sets its sights on the $2 mark, fueled by a loyal community and increasing adoption. However, the spotlight may soon shift to Lightchain AI (LCAI) , a unique blockchain project integrating artificial intelligence with decentralized technology. With its captivating roadmap and real-world applications, LCAI has the potential to reach $10, delivering a staggering 30,000x return for early investors. As excitement builds around these two projects, Lightchain AI is emerging as a game-changer in the crypto space, promising unparalleled growth and unique features. Dogecoin’s path to $2- meme coin mania or real value? Dogecoin, first made as a fun thing in 2013, has changed into an important part of the cryptocurrency scene. Its path to the $2 point is pushed by mix of group excitement, famous people saying good things, and guess trading. Elon Musk’s help has clearly shaped its worth; his tweets many times make prices go up Helpers such as Kaleo guess that Dogecoin might hit $2 by the start of 2025, pointing to past trends and the ongoing memecoin boom. But, problems still exist. Dogecoin’s big amount in use and its link to social media fads add to its ups and downs. Doubters say that with no ͏real value or special tech perks, its lasting strength is still unclear. To sum up, although Dogecoin’s way to $2 is likely, it is greatly shaped by market feeling and guesswork. Investors must be careful, knowing the risks linked with these kinds of assets. You might also like: DOGE & SHIB holders embrace Lightchain AI for its growth and unique sports-crypto vision Lightchain AI- aiming for $10 and 30,000x growth potential Lightchain AI is an emerging cryptocurrency that integrates artificial intelligence with blockchain technology. Its native token, LCAI, is currently in presale at $0.003 per token. Analysts project that LCAI could reach $10 by 2025, representing a 333x return on investment. Key innovations driving this potential include the Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism, which rewards nodes for AI computations, and the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), optimized for AI workloads. These technologies position Lightchain AI to capture significant market share as the AI and blockchain sectors expand. However, investors should conduct thorough research and consider market volatility before investing. Comparative analysis: Dogecoin vs. Lightchain AI in 2024 As we approach 2025, both Dogecoin and Lightchain AI have the potential to reach significant milestones. However, a comparative analysis suggests that Lightchain AI holds more promise for long-term growth and value. While Dogecoin’s community and media attention contribute to its current momentum, it is subject to market fluctuations and lacks technological differentiators. In contrast, Lightchain AI’s innovative roadmap and partnerships with notable players like Microsoft Azure position it as a leader in the emerging AI blockchain space. Furthermore, with LCAI currently available at $0.003 per token (during presale), early investors could see a 30,000x return if LCAI reaches its projected value of $10. In contrast, Dogecoin’s potential at $2 represents a 666x return. Its scalability and potential for real-world adoption also make Lightchain AI a more attractive investment opportunity. While both projects offer exciting prospects, Lightchain AI appears to have more robust foundations for sustainable growth and value in the long run. Why Lightchain AI might outshine Dogecoin in long-term gains Lightchain AI presents several advantages that could lead to superior long-term gains compared to Dogecoin. Data Privacy Innovations Lightchain AI employs advanced encryption techniques to facilitate secure data sharing, ensuring compliance with global privacy regulations. This focus on data privacy makes it a compelling choice for enterprises requiring stringent data protection measures. Cross-Chain Interoperability Unlike platforms such as Solana , which have experienced congestion issues, Lightchain AI supports seamless interactions across multiple blockchains. This interoperability offers developers unparalleled flexibility, enabling the creation of versatile decentralized applications (dApps) that can operate across various blockchain ecosystems. Deflationary Tokenomics Lightchain AI incorporates a burn mechanism that reduces the token supply over time, promoting scarcity and potential value appreciation for LCAI holders. This deflationary model contrasts with Dogecoin’s inflationary supply, positioning LCAI as a more attractive option for long-term investors seeking value growth. Lightchain AI’s emphasis on data privacy, cross-chain interoperability, and deflationary tokenomics provides a robust foundation for sustained growth, potentially outpacing Dogecoin in delivering long-term returns. Here’s the chance Cryptocurrency, in its relatively nascent stage, presents investors with an opportunity for exponential growth. As we have seen with Dogecoin and Lightchain AI, even small investments can lead to significant returns if the project delivers on its promises. While the crypto space can be volatile, with careful research and a long-term perspective, investors can identify projects like Lightchain AI that offer an attractive balance of unique features and potential value growth. Invest today in Lightchain AI presale and get a chance to be part of the exciting journey towards $10 and beyond. Join us for more information on how to become a part of this amazing project. So don’t wait, take a chance on Lightchain AI and potentially reap significant rewards in the future! To learn more about Lightchain AI, visit the website , whitepaper, X , and Telegram.

SUI is also down by 8% in a week, yet it remains up by 21% in a month and by an enviable 495% in the past year, with the Libra/Diem offshoot now the 18th-biggest token in the market by cap. For some holders and supporters, Sui will only continue rising up the market leaderboard, with some referring to it as “ the next Solana .” And with its strong pedigree and promising fundamentals, it has every chance of becoming one of 2025’s bigger success stories, especially if it can manage to attract some real adoption.

Other traders and Sui holders are similarly bullish about the token’s prospects, with DegenDollaz recently forecasting that the alt could rise to $30 next year . My realistic price target for $SUI is $25-$35. The community is growing. The technology is improving. The Memecoins are improving. Remains the hottest L1. Increasing popularity on Twitter. I mean what else can you ask for? Buying A LOT more here. pic.twitter.com/KZVaEra7H1 — DegenDollaz (@DegenDollaz) November 26, 2024 Other analysts have also highlighted Sui as among the “ most promising altcoins that will grow 5-20x ” in the current bull cycle. This is a justifiable stance to take, given that Sui is one of the most promising newer layer-one networks in the market. Launched by alumni from Facebook’s failed Libra/Diem project, it uses the Move programming language, which promises to make blockchain development simpler and more efficient. According to DefiLlama, it already has a total value locked in of $1.7 billion , representing a doubling since late September and a 740% increase over the last 12 months. This testifies to a growth in usage, with the platform announcing a global partnership with Revolut this year, for instance, as well as the launch of the USDC stablecoin on its network . Its long-term picture looks very good, while today its chart suggests that it’s close to recovering after weekend losses. Source: TradingView After dipping to almost 30 yesterday, the coin’s RSI (purple) has just touched 50 again, hinting that buyers are beginning to take advantage of its recent discounts. And while its 30-period average (orange) has just fallen below the 200-period average (blue), this also suggests that it could rebound anytime soon. Based on these indicators, and based on still-high volumes ($2.1 billion today), SUI should hit $4.50 by the end of the year. New Meme Tokens For Market-Beating Gains Traders looking to diversify beyond the biggest alts may be pleased to learn that there’s no shortage of promising new tokens in the market, including several very strong presale coins. One of these is Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) , an ERC-20 token that has raised a whopping $34.8 million in its ongoing sale. $30M raised. Memes run the internet. Wepe runs the memes. pic.twitter.com/scMZmwEfKv — Wall Street Pepe (@WEPEToken) December 18, 2024 While WEPE is ostensibly a meme coin, it also comes with its very own trade intelligence platform, giving it much stronger fundamentals than most other new projects. As a trading intelligence platform, it will provide investors with real-time analysis and market insights, including buying signals and insider trading tips. It will also have its own online community spaces and forums, enabling users to share advice and analysis. These spaces will also give users the chance to compete in trading competitions, with the winners of such contests earning rewards in WEPE. On top of this, the token will also be open to staking, making it potentially very profitable. Investors can join its sale by heading over to its official website , where WEPE is currently selling at $0.0003653. This will continue to increase incrementally over the course of the sale, so anyone interested in Wall Street Pepe should act now to lock in the biggest possible gains.

The metric coincides with the Cyvers estimate of around $1.4B , of which North Korean hackers may have taken in up to $1.34B . December was the slowest month in terms of exploits, with $3.9M to date.

ImmuneFi believes the threat remains, both from North Korean hackers and other exploiters. For the past year, the losses from DMM Bitcoin and WazirX were among the largest, reaching 540M or up to 38% of all losses. Most of the big exploits happened in Q2, during the first rally of the bull market. During that quarter, $572M was lost across 72 incidents. The last three months of 2024, despite the bull market, only led to $150M in nominal losses. Centralized exchanges faced 11 major incidents, making up more than 48% of all hacks this year. The trend is shifting back to CEX, aiming to exploit any remaining weaknesses. Centralized exchanges suffered more than 726M in attacks for 2024, compared to only 408.9M in 2023. The interest in centralized markets coincides with a new inflow of users and higher liquidity during the 2024 bull market. With the rise of Web3, hacks and exploits switched to DeFi and DEX, making up 51.4% of losses. The year is heading to its close with a total of 232 incidents against entities and protocols, not counting individual wallet exploits. In 2023, a total of 320 incidents wrapped up the whole year, despite the bear market. Hackers targeted top chains with potential vulnerabilities Ethereum remained the biggest arena for hacks and exploits, due to the numerous projects and smart contracts. The easy availability of swapping, mixers, or DeFi protocols to hide the origins of funds was also a key point for hackers to pick the chain. Some of the exploits also affected BNB Chain, which carried 39% of the attacks. BNB Chain projects are relatively older and more liquid, hence the attempt to drain liquidity or perform other exploits. Arbitrum was the third-largest chain, with the remaining 6.8% of the exploits. As projects increased their security and found more sophisticated methods, the nature of attacks changed. Projects were exploited through the loss or exposure of private keys, some acquired through malicious links or social engineering. Radiant Capital lost $50M, becoming the biggest exploit in Q4, which hinged on stolen private keys. Some of the projects targeted the protocol’s reserves, while others were user-facing, with faked sites or features capable of draining wallets. Hacks still exceed fraud losses Hacks are still the more harmful attack, despite the ubiquitous frauds and scams in Web3 space. According to ImmuneFi, 98.1% of attacks were some form of hack, while scams only accounted for a smaller share of losses. Despite this, scams and frauds managed to take away more than $28M based on distinct incidents. This does not include sandwich attacks, MEV bot exploits, flash loan exploits, or token rug pulls. Despite the growth of DeFi in 2024, frauds are down by 99.8% for Q4, compared to the same quarter of 2023. With more sophisticated users and smart wallets, fraud is slowing down. For Q4, hacks were 68% down compared to Q4, 2023. The year saw hacks winding down, with most of the losses caused by a few incidents. Most trackers also take into account the immediate loss of funds, though, for projects, a hack often leads to loss of market value and reputational damage.

38012783,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=375825,1734974431,Elon Musk: ‘Shocked’ If Biden Doesn’t Pardon SBF Amid Rising Rumors,"The growing speculation surrounding a potential presidential pardon for Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) has been fueled by high-profile figures and shifting political tides. A major Trump ally, Elon Musk, for one, will be “shocked” if US President Joe Biden does not grant an early pardon to the disgraced former CEO of FTX. Crypto, Politics, and Pardons Bankman-Fried, who was convicted in November 2023 on seven charges, including fraud and embezzlement, is currently serving a 25-year sentence for his role in the collapse of the cryptocurrency exchange. However, rumors of a pardon have gained traction, partly due to his significant political connections. As one of the largest donors to the Democratic Party, Bankman-Fried’s ties to key political figures, particularly Biden, have led many to wonder whether his political influence could play a role in securing a pardon. Speculation surrounding the possibility of clemency gained additional attention following comments from Musk, who tweeted that he would be “shocked if this doesn’t happen.” This statement aligns with shifting predictions on platforms like Polymarket, where odds for a potential pardon surged from 4% to 13%, indicating a growing belief that SBF’s ties to political elites might influence his fate. SBF’s trajectory from crypto wunderkind to convicted fraudster has been one of the most dramatic downfalls in recent financial history. At his peak, he was hailed as a leading figure in the industry, having founded FTX in 2019 and quickly built it into one of the world’s largest exchanges. He cultivated a public persona as a tech innovator with a commitment to social causes that earned him widespread recognition beyond the crypto circles. His political contributions were massive, with over $5 million donated to Biden’s 2020 campaign and nearly all his donations directed toward Democrats. However, the collapse of FTX in late 2022 exposed a $8 billion hole in customer funds that sent shockwaves through the financial world. While the legal case against him resulted in a conviction, some continue to speculate that a presidential pardon could allow the Biden administration to move on from the scandal. Ross Ulbricht’s Fate Still Unclear Meanwhile, the odds of Biden pardoning Ross Ulbricht, creator of the Silk Road marketplace, currently stands at 9%. However, Ulbricht could see freedom under Donald Trump’s presidency after the president-elect pledged to pardon him earlier this year. Ulbricht was convicted in 2015 on multiple charges, including drug trafficking and money laundering, and sentenced to life in prison. While libertarian and crypto advocates see him as a symbol of free trade and argue his punishment is unjust, critics highlight Silk Road’s links to drug overdoses and allegations that Ulbricht plotted murders to protect his platform. The Silk Road, active between 2011 and 2013, pioneered anonymous online trading using Bitcoin and Tor. Ulbricht’s mother, Lyn, led a high-profile campaign to reduce her son’s sentence, attracting widespread public support.

38012689,https://finbold.com/?p=222200,1734974005,"MicroStrategy buys Bitcoin price top at $106k, already down 12%","MicroStrategy Inc (NASDAQ: MSTR ) announced another Bitcoin ( BTC ) purchase on December 23 at an average price of $106,662. This marks an announcement made at a price below the dollar-cost average, signaling a buy at Bitcoin’s local top. Nevertheless, the company is still profitable with its Bitcoin portfolio, and MSTR’s stock steadily sustains a premium against its holdings. According to Michael Saylor ’s announcement , MicroStrategy has acquired 444,262 BTC at an average cost of $62,257. This most recent purchase was of 5,262 BTC for $561 million and MicroStrategy’s lowest disclosed buy since July 2024. On that note, the economist and known Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff has commented on X, highlighting a “firepower” loss. Schiff has been commenting against Saylor’s Bitcoin strategy for a while, as Finbold reported in one occasion. “It seems like you are running out of firepower to keep propping up Bitcoin. Plus, not only is this your smallest buy, but the first time your average purchase price has been above the market price on the Monday you disclosed the buy.” – Peter Schiff MicroStrategy’s lowest Bitcoin buy at the top Interestingly, this recent purchase is approximately three times lower than the previous purchase at $100,000, announced on December 16. Moreover, it is nearly four times lower than the one before that, announced on December 9, as Lookonchain analyzed . The purchases were of 5,262, 15,350, and 21,550 BTC, respectively. In November, MicroStrategy made two buys superior to 50,000 BTC , or nearly ten times higher than last week’s acquisition. MicroStrategy Bitcoin acquisitions. Source: Lookonchain Novacula Occami, former Wall Street analyst, also commented on Michael Saylor’s strategy, explaining it relies on two pillars. First, Saylor buys when “numbers go up,” the analyst said, and then on “exciting the less sophisticated herd,” he concluded. Essentially, Occami believes the purchases are always made when Bitcoin shows strong momentum, usually amid a rally. This is supposedly done to attract retail traders with positive sentiment regarding BTC and MSTR. MSTR stock and Bitcoin (BTC) price analysis Indeed, MSTR stock is trading at $344.27, with a market capitalization that is two times higher than its Bitcoin holdings, making it a 100% premium against usual BTC investments for investors who want Bitcoin exposure through MicroStrategy. Meanwhile, BTC is trading at $93,113, at a 12% discount from Saylor’s most recent average Bitcoin acquisition price. Bitcoin (BTC) price vs. MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR) stock price. Source: TradingView / Finbold / Vini Barbosa Looking at Bitcoin’s chart, we can see that, after every MicroStrategy purchase, BTC experienced an aggressive drop below the average. This validates the two analysts’ criticisms regarding Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin strategy, which now experiences one of the longest recent drawbacks. However, it is notable that the company’s high time frame results are still massively positive, accumulating an unrealized profit of nearly $15 billion. Featured image from Shutterstock.

Ted supports crypto-friendly laws, runs mining rigs in West Texas, and opposes strict federal rules. With Texas already growing in crypto, Cruz believes it can lead the digital revolution. Senator Ted Cruz is one of the most passionate senators about Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. He wants Texas to be the center of crypto innovation, as he always expressed his vision wherever possible. Cruz views Bitcoin as more than just a currency or an asset he sees it as a symbol of freedom, decentralization, and independence, which Texas has always embraced. Ted Cruz’s vision for Texas as a crypto leader “We are also going to unleash crypto I’m proud to stand with crypto I’m proud to stand with Bitcoin and I am the only member of the United States Senate who is in fact a Bitcoin minor,” Cruz statements at America Fest 2024 by Turning Point USA in Phoenix, Arizona.

He operates three Bitcoin mining facilities in West Texas, demonstrating his strong commitment to Bitcoin and his vision of transforming Texas into a crypto hub. “I am a strong advocate for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in the U.S. Senate,” Cruz declared, emphasizing his goal to transform Texas into the global leader for Bitcoin. For Cruz, Texas is the perfect place for Bitcoin to flourish. “ Texas has the resources and mindset to be the center of this technology,” Cruz said, that the state is well suited for the digital asset revolution.

A breakdown of ownership indicates that Ripple -controlled addresses account for most of the asset, primarily locked in escrow. Major exchanges also rank among the top holders. The top 10 XRP holders collectively own 35.39% of the total supply, amounting to 27.53 billion tokens. Ripple dominates this list, with its seven accounts holding 24.53 billion XRP, including tokens in escrow, representing 31.57% of the total supply, according to data retrieved by Finbold from XRP Scan on December 23. Additionally, Uphold and Bithumb features are available among the top owners. Uphold holds 1.86 billion XRP (1.86%), and Bithumb accounts for 1.39 billion XRP (1.39%). XRP top ten holders. Source: XRP Scan XRP centralization concerns Although Ripple has implemented a clear XRP management plan, the concentration of assets in a few company-affiliated addresses raises concerns about centralization. Critics argue this goes against the principles of blockchain decentralization and trustlessness. For instance, cryptocurrency researcher Justin Bons challenged Ripple’s decentralization claims earlier in December, highlighting possible flaws in XRP’s design. In an X post on December 3, Bons asserted that XRP relies on a centralized Unique Node List (UNL) and uses Proof of Authority (PoA), allowing the XRP Foundation to control validators and enforce compliance. Bons further criticized XRP’s lack of validator incentives, a 99.8% pre-mine, and reliance on founder-held token sales, which he believes compromise fairness and transparency. He recommended Ripple adopt a Proof of Stake (PoS) model to decentralize validator selection and promote transparency. You are completely focused on a detail that absolutely does not matter in any realistic way. Validators are not compensated. They cannot censor unless node operators configure their code to allow them to. They do resolve the double spend problem, but honest users don't double… — David ""JoelKatz"" Schwartz (@JoelKatz) December 3, 2024 Financial educator and Bitcoin ( BTC ) advocate Rajat Soni echoed similar concerns, labeling XRP a ‘scam’ capable of enabling price manipulation. Despite these criticisms, it is worth noting that Ripple does not control the XRP Ledger. Changes to the ledger require validator consensus rather than unilateral decisions. Furthermore, the total XRP supply has remained capped at 100 billion since its pre-mining phase. XRP price analysis As of press time, XRP was trading at $2.14, down nearly 4% in the last 24 hours and over 14% on the weekly chart. The bearish sentiment has hindered XRP’s trajectory toward the $3 resistance level. XRP seven-day price chart.

Regarding the next price movement, crypto analyst Dark Defender noted in a December 22 post that XRP is consolidating within a descending triangle and testing a key support line around $1.80.

38012644,https://nulltx.com/?p=136234,1734973202,BlockDAG & XLM Prices Up; Positive Chainlink Outlook,"Analysts Recommend Buying BlockDAG Now as a Price Jump is Expected Soon! Chainlink & XLM Forecasts Look Promising The cryptocurrency market is buzzing with opportunities that could disappear in a moment! Chainlink (LINK) technical analysis indicates strong upward momentum, with LINK now trading around $29, aiming for $32 and $34 soon. Similarly, Stellar’s (XLM) price prediction is very optimistic, forecasting a potential 360% rise, especially after a robust 342% increase in the last three months. At the heart of this buzz is BlockDAG (BDAG), which is reshaping what we think about blockchain’s scalability and innovation. With over $171.5 million raised and 17.4 billion coins sold, the end of BlockDAG’s presale batch 26 is imminent. With a price of $0.0234, BDAG presents a fleeting chance to buy before prices climb in the next batch. Plus, a remarkable 2,240% rise since its first batch positions BDAG as the top crypto pick for 2025. Chainlink Technical Analysis Shows Strong Upward Trend Recent Chainlink technical analysis points to continued strong upward momentum, with the token near $29 and a 104% rise this month alone. Analysts point to a critical resistance at $29.954, which coincides with the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level. Breaking above this could push prices to between $32 and $34. Institutional interest in LINK is high, with increased whale activity and more engagement from institutions like Grayscale’s Chainlink Trust. This upbeat Chainlink technical analysis is in line with recent enhancements, including Chainlink’s Verifiable Random Function (VRF) integration, which improves security in decentralized gaming. Overall, this Chainlink analysis suggests growing ecosystem development and a positive outlook for future price movements. Stellar Price Forecast: Can XLM Jump 360%? The latest Stellar (XLM) price prediction shows great promise, with a potential leap to $2.27 forecasted. Stellar Lumens has already soared 342% in just the past 90 days, driven by strong technical patterns. Analyst EGRAG CRYPTO notes similarities between XLM’s current market actions and its 2020 performance, which sparked a 3,100% rally. Short-term goals for Stellar include breaking the $1 barrier, with key resistance at $0.6355 being critical. The technical analysis reveals a bullish pennant pattern, suggesting a possible rise to $0.7960 and potentially higher. The Stellar price prediction highlights a chance for significant growth, though traders should remain cautious of potential pullbacks as XLM approaches key resistance levels. BlockDAG’s Final Moments in Batch 26 Predict Rise in Value BlockDAG’s presale is drawing to a close for Batch 26, having raised over $171.5 million and sold 17.4 billion BDAG coins, fueling continued excitement around its prospects. With a current price of $0.0234, BDAG offers traders a rare chance before an expected price rise in Batch 27. Early supporters have experienced a 2,240% ROI, bolstering the view of BlockDAG’s potential as a top contender for the best crypto of 2025. BlockDAG leverages cutting-edge Layer 1 technology, blending WebAssembly (WASM) and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility, which attracts both developers and large-scale interests. The recent release of Whitepaper V3 outlines ambitious plans to transform decentralized applications, backed by a clear supply limit of 150 billion coins. In tandem with Whitepaper V3, a new Litepaper was issued, enhancing community involvement by detailing the innovative Proof of Work (PoW) and Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technologies that underpin BlockDAG’s expandable network. As the presale moves into Batch 27, the price of BDAG is expected to jump from the present $0.0248 per coin, presenting traders with a fleeting opportunity to buy at a lower price before the increase. This transition is also sparking significant interest from large entities, positioning BlockDAG as a pioneering force in the cryptocurrency market. Catch the Prime Crypto Pick for 2025! As Chainlink’s technical analysis shows a promising climb to $34 and Stellar’s price predictions suggest a potential 360% increase to $2.27, the crypto scene is aligning with high-value opportunities. Nevertheless, BlockDAG stands out as the prime pick, with over $171.5 million raised, 17.4 billion coins sold, and a remarkable 2,240% ROI already benefiting early backers. With Batch 26 soon closing and a price increase on the horizon, traders have a limited window to purchase BDAG at the current rate of $0.0234 per coin. As the momentum of BlockDAG’s crypto presale picks up and interest from large-scale entities grows, BDAG is increasingly recognized as the best crypto for 2025!

This signal suggests that Bitcoin’s bearish momentum could be waning, making this a potentially critical moment to consider entering the market. Bitcoin Price TD Sequential Flashes Buy Signal A TD Sequential is a unique technical indicator that identifies trend exhaustion and price reversals and indicates buy or sell signals. According to an X (formerly Twitter) post by crypto analyst Ali Martinez, Bitcoin’s 4-hour chart showcases a green “9” candle, signaling a potential buying opportunity. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Above $10: Historical Data Shows How High DOGE Will Go This Bull Cycle Typically, in a downtrend, the green 9 candle is interpreted as a buy signal, indicating that bearish momentum might be reaching exhaustion and prices could be getting ready for a rebound. Martinez also shows an ”A13” marker on the TD Sequential chart, which represents a countdown phase that tracks 13 additional candles and identifies a stronger trend exhaustion. During a downtrend, the appearance of a TD Sequential A13 often signals a potential decline in a cryptocurrency’s sell-off phase, reinforcing the possibility of a price reversal. Bitcoin’s current buy signal emerged as its price exceeded $94,000. This buy signal suggests an optimal time to enter the market, with the $94,915 price point highlighted as a potential entry for traders aiming to capitalize on a possible Bitcoin price rebound. Although the TD Sequential is an indicator used to identify buy and sell signals, market participants can exercise caution by considering additional factors like volatility, broader market sentiment, and more. If the current buy signal holds, Martinez has predicted that a price rebound can be expected. However, a failure to maintain its current price could lead to further downsides, potentially pushing Bitcoin to its next critical support level. BTC Market Top Set At $168,500 In another more recent X post, Martinez presented a chart of Bitcoin’s price movements, predicting a market top above $168,500 based on the Mayer Multiple. The chart shows Bitcoin price performance based on the Mayer Multiple, which compares BTC to the 200-day Moving Average (MA). Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Above $100,000 Again? Why $99,800 Is An Important Resistance To Break The red line, as seen on the chart, indicates the Mayer MultipLe (MM) at 2.4, while the green line showcases MM at 0.8. Additionally, the blue line is the Oscillator, which tracks the Mayer Multiple over time. Historically, the Bitcoin price tops have coincided with the Mayer Multiple reaching the 2.4 level or higher. Currently, Bitcoin’s Multiple Mayer sits at 1.3845 in the chart. However, if its price continues to rise and the MM reaches 2.4 again, Martinez predicts a market top above $168,500 for Bitcoin. As of writing, Bitcoin’s price is $94,692, meaning a surge to $168,500 would require a significant 78% increase from its present market value.

Musk the Manipulator (MUSKMANI), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKMANI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk the Manipulator can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk the Manipulator could become the next viral memecoin. Musk the Manipulator launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk the Manipulator on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk the Manipulator by entering its contract address – DZpfk5LaLrnP6vSFJnLSMAopUuTJGiFk7543rQxh4ids – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKMANI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/solana-memecoin-musk-the-manipulator-muskmani-will-skyrocket-14000-before-exchange-listing/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Ripple ( XRP ) retreated to $2.14 on Monday, a 26% decline from its highest level this month, meaning that it has moved into a bear market. XRP’s drop happened as its social sentiment score and futures open interest continued falling. According to CoinGlass, the futures open interest dropped to $1.89 billion on Monday, down from the year-to-date high of over $4.29 billion. Ripple’s daily volume has also dropped in the past few weeks as its momentum waned. Its 24-hour volume was over $10 billion, much lower than what it handled a few weeks ago. You might also like: Solana beats Ethereum in a key metric 3 months in a row Still, XRP price has some important fundamentals that could push it higher in the near term. The most important metric is that many large holders are not selling. According to Santiment , XRP has over 5.75 million holders, higher than the October low of 5.36 million. Similarly, the number of active addresses dropped slightly during this sell-off. XRP number of holders and active addresses | Source: Santiment XRP also has more catalysts ahead. CoinMarketCap data shows that the Ripple USD stablecoin’s market cap has risen to over $53 million a week after its launch. Still, CMC warns that its assets in the RLUSD stablecoin have not been verified. Further, there are rising odds that the Securities and Exchange Commission will approve a spot XRP ETF in 2025. Donald Trump has pledged to be a more crypto-friendly president and has already started to constitute members of the crypto council. A spot ETF would likely create more hype for the coin and demand. XRP price analysis as a bullish pattern forms XRP chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the Ripple price is slowly forming a bullish pennant chart pattern. This is a popular continuation sign made up of a vertical flag pole and a triangle pattern, which is now forming. The lower side of the triangle connects the lowest points on Dec. 10 and 20. The upper side touches the highest swing on Dec. 3 and 17. There are signs that this consolidation will continue for a while. XRP price has also moved above the 50-day moving average and is at the weak, stop & reverse point of the Murrey Math Lines. Therefore, the coin will likely have a bullish breakout as bulls target the year-to-date high of $2.90.

This fast-paced, Unreal Engine-powered racing game is set to transform the gaming industry by combining intense gameplay with tangible rewards. Developed by a team passionate about gaming and innovation, Yeti Go promises a high-octane, skill-based experience that offers players real-world earning opportunities through tokens of Yeti Ouro (YETIO). As excitement builds, the ongoing presale for YETIO has surpassed $1.28 million in Stage 2, highlighting the massive potential of this project. With an exclusive 20% bonus on token purchases from December 24th to 26th, now is the perfect time to join the Yeti Go ecosystem. What Is Yeti Go: Where Gaming Meets Crypto Yeti Go is more than just a game; it’s an ecosystem that merges the thrill of racing with blockchain innovation. Unlike traditional games, Yeti Go utilizes YETIO tokens as the native currency in the same universe. These tokens allow players to earn, stake, and spend while they compete in dynamic player-versus-player (PvP) races. Players are confronted with various interactive tracks, including obstacles, power-ups and environmental hazards. Whether making strategic moves to outsmart opponents or dodging traps on the racetrack, Yeti Go keeps players on the edge of their seats with every moment of the game. Key features include: Destructive PvP Racing: Ram other racers off the edge of platforms or use in-game weapons to KO the competition. Power-Ups and Weapons: Use power-ups and weapons to disrupt other competitors. P2E Rewards: Generate YETIO tokens by winning races, fulfilling challenges, and other events. You can use YETIO to purchase skins, gadgets, and collectables in the player-driven marketplace. Yeti Ouro: The Heart Of The Ecosystem The Yeti Ouro token is at the heart of this innovative P2E game. Designed on the Ethereum blockchain, YETIO leverages utility and scarcity to allow for long-term value creation for investors and gamers. YETIO has a low total supply of 1 billion tokens, a strong burn mechanism, and staking opportunities, meaning that as demand grows, the value of YETIO should be appreciated. In-game, YETIO plays a crucial role in unlocking premium features. Players can use tokens to: That’s where high-stakes tournaments come in. Modify vehicles and avatars. Buy rare goods from the marketplace. Earn extra rewards by staking tokens. With Yeti Ouro already gaining traction from investors and gamers alike, it's a crypto project to watch this December. Engaging the Community: Meme Contest and Referral Program An active community drives the successful Yeti Ouro. How do we plan to celebrate our growth? Well, the team has kicked off two new initiatives. Meme Contest Step 1: Make a Yeti meme and tweet it with #YetiMeme. Prizes: $2,000, $1,000, and $500 worth of YETIO tokens The contest ends on December 25th. Referral Campaign You only need to invite your friends to join the presale using your unique referral link. Earn a 10% reward for each successful referral. You will find referral links in the Yeti Ouro dashboard. These campaigns reward participants and expand the Yeti Go community, strengthening the project as it grows. December 24 – 26: 20% More on All Purchases Yeti Ouro offers an exclusive 20% bonus on all token purchases during the holiday season. This limited-time offer provides an incredible opportunity to maximize holdings before the next presale stage. With over $1.28 million already raised, the project is gaining momentum, and early investors stand to benefit the most. Yeti Go: Why Is the Future Of P2E? The Yeti Go is not a P2E game but a breakthrough in how games are played, enjoyed, and monetized. Introducing YETIO tokens into an exciting, competitive match gives YETIO a unique place in the increasingly competitive gaming and crypto markets. Both investors and gamers are taking note of Yeti Go's potential. Combining dynamic play, deep community participation, and lucrative incentive systems, this project looks good to go the distance.

38012170,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=632395,1734971488,Pavel Durov turns Telegram profitable for the first time in history,"For the first time since its launch, Telegram is turning a profit. Pavel Durov, the app’s elusive founder and CEO, announced on X that the messaging platform has paid off a “meaningful share” of its massive $2 billion debt. Telegram, once an industry mystery for its inability to generate income, now boasts over $1 billion in revenue for 2024 and has $500 million in cash reserves, not even counting its crypto holdings. This financial win places Telegram in a new league. The app now has over 900 million active users worldwide. The financial turnaround and a billionaire under fire Telegram’s new financial status doesn’t mean the heat is off though. French prosecutors charged Pavel earlier this year, accusing him of enabling crimes on his platform, including the distribution of child sexual abuse material. The allegations forced Pavel to stay in France during the investigation, a surprising twist for a man who’s made freedom his brand. “We’re making Telegram stronger, financially and technically,” Pavel said in his post, brushing aside his legal troubles. But his troubles are stacking up fast. Governments worldwide have accused Telegram of being a hotbed for illegal activities and misinformation. In Moldova, authorities say Telegram was the backbone for a Russia-backed plan to destabilize the country. In Spain, conspiracy theories about deadly floods spread unchecked, falsely claiming the storm was engineered to ruin crops. More than 150 people died, but on Telegram, the real tragedy got buried under fake headlines. In the U.S., the situation is just as chaotic. White supremacist groups have turned Telegram into their recruitment hub, posing as “men-only fight clubs” while spreading racist conspiracies. Civil rights groups and researchers say these extremists are thriving because Telegram doesn’t filter or push content like Facebook or TikTok. Instead, users freely cross-post content from one channel to another, creating a domino effect of disinformation. This isn’t just about content. Encryption—or the lack of it—has become a sticking point. Unlike WhatsApp or Signal, which offer end-to-end encryption by default, Telegram only protects messages in “secret chats.” Regular chats? Not so much. Telegram’s encryption protocol is also proprietary, which means security experts can’t even verify if it works as advertised. Extremism, propaganda, and the Telegram machine Telegram’s flexibility is both its strength and its Achilles’ heel. Unlike platforms that curate content based on user activity, Telegram keeps things wide open. Want to promote your far-right manifesto? No problem. Pro-Russian propaganda? There’s a channel for that too. Russian intelligence officers have reportedly used the platform to recruit criminals for sabotage missions across Europe. Meanwhile, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and ordinary Ukrainians rely on Telegram to share updates about the war. The app has also become a go-to for conspiracy theorists. Trump supporters are finding themselves lured into more extreme political spaces through interconnected channels. Law enforcement agencies aren’t having an easy time dealing with Telegram. Unlike Meta, which owns Facebook and WhatsApp and is bound by U.S. law, Telegram operates from Dubai, far out of reach for most governments. In 2018, the Kremlin tried to ban the app outright, only to fail spectacularly and lift the ban two years later. Russia claimed Pavel had agreed to fight extremism on the platform, but the reality remains murky. The French legal case against Pavel has triggered some policy changes. Telegram now complies with legal requests for user IP addresses and phone numbers, a big change from its earlier refusal to cooperate with authorities. The company also uses AI tools and moderators to identify and hide problematic content. How Telegram makes money Telegram’s monetization efforts began in 2020, with Pavel announcing plans to end the platform’s zero-revenue streak. Telegram Premium, launched in 2022, charges users for faster downloads, larger file uploads, and other perks. The platform also introduced an ad-revenue sharing model for content creators, allowing them to keep 50% of the earnings from ads displayed on their channels. Even with these new revenue streams, much of Telegram’s funding has come straight from the founders. Telegram’s origin story is just as intriguing as its present. Pavel and his brother Nikolai launched the app after leaving Russia in 2014. Their previous project, VKontakte, Russia’s biggest social network, had been targeted by Kremlin-linked billionaires. Nikolai developed Telegram’s data transfer systems, while Pavel poured his resources into making it an alternative to Silicon Valley’s giants. A crypto industry jewel Meanwhile, Telegram has doubled down on crypto, turning it into a core part of its ecosystem. And it’s paying off big time. The app’s crypto story started with a bang — the Telegram Open Network (TON). Back in 2018, Pavel Durov wanted to create a blockchain that could handle transactions faster than anything else out there. It was ambitious, maybe too ambitious, because the U.S. SEC came down hard, shutting down the project’s $1.7 billion ICO. Fast forward to 2024, and crypto is a money machine for Telegram. The company made over $353 million from crypto transactions this year alone. And their crypto holdings have surged to $1.3 billion, up from $400 million just last year. Deals like the one with Toncoin, where Telegram scored $225 million for exclusive ad rights, show just how central crypto is to their strategy. Telegram’s crypto features are also driving adoption, especially in regions like Africa, where young people are turning to crypto to escape broken financial systems. The app has become the go-to place for buying, selling, and talking crypto.

For starters, Ethereum Classic (ETC) price prediction has taken an optimistic turn, with analysts pointing to a possible 20% rally if it sustains momentum above $28.50. Similarly, the Polkadot potential is looking brighter with its innovative 2.0 upgrades, including a modular framework aimed at scalability and flexibility, and its integration with stablecoin payment systems bridging Web3 with traditional finance. Yet, these developments may not outshine BlockDAG , which combines cutting-edge DAG-based technology with a thriving presale nearing $171.5 million. BlockDAG’s activated partnership with Inter Milan positions it for global exposure through fan engagement, on-ground branding, and digital innovation—delivering long-term growth potential. BlockDAG's Inter Milan Deal: A Catalyst for Growth The activation of BlockDAG’s partnership with Inter Milan is more than just a branding exercise—it’s a direct boost to the value potential of BDAG coins. By tapping into the global reach of one of Europe’s top football clubs, BlockDAG gains unparalleled exposure to millions of fans, showcasing its technology and driving adoption. Fan engagement initiatives, like branding and merchandise solutions, introduce new revenue streams that directly enhance the ecosystem supporting BDAG, creating value for long-term holders. This value creation aligns with market examples where major partnerships have driven token growth. For instance, sports partnerships by major crypto projects have historically increased user engagement, leading to price appreciation. BlockDAG’s deal mirrors this trend, giving BDAG a foothold in the lucrative sports market. The presale success, raising over $171.5 million, reinforces this demand, as buyers position themselves early to benefit from future price surges driven by adoption. The presale’s tiered rewards, like the BDAG250 bonus, amplify this potential. Early buyers not only secure tokens at discounted prices but also stand to benefit from the project’s milestones, including its high-speed blockchain technology. Compared to other top crypto assets, BDAG coins offer a blend of growth potential and real-world utility. With the Inter Milan deal active and milestones like the X1 Miner App strengthening the ecosystem, BDAG holders are uniquely positioned to capitalize on the project’s growing adoption and integration, turning today’s purchase into tomorrow’s profit. Can Ethereum Classic (ETC) Price Prediction Hold for Long? Ethereum Classic (ETC) price prediction has caught attention recently, with analysts eyeing a potential 20% surge if the token sustains levels above $28.50. This optimistic outlook is fueled by reduced exchange inflows, indicating accumulation by long-term holders. Technical indicators, such as a strengthening Relative Strength Index (RSI), further support this bullish trend. However, ETC’s limited ecosystem development and lack of innovative upgrades leave questions about its ability to maintain long-term growth, especially in a competitive market. Compared to newer projects, ETC relies heavily on its status as Ethereum's original chain. While its commitment to Proof of Work attracts miners, its technological progress lags behind other blockchains driving innovation. For traders seeking sustained returns, ETC’s growth potential may face challenges, emphasizing the need for diversification into assets with advanced scalability and real-world utility. Exploring the Growing Polkadot Potential The Polkadot potential has surged recently with its Polkadot 2.0 upgrades, signaling a major shift in its framework. The introduction of Agile Coretime and modular designs allows developers to lease computational power, increasing scalability and adaptability for diverse blockchain applications. Partnerships like Harbour’s stablecoin payment system integration further showcase Polkadot’s growing use cases in bridging Web3 with traditional financial systems, positioning it as a key player in the evolving blockchain ecosystem. Despite these advancements, Polkadot’s price has struggled to gain momentum, with analysts identifying $10.88 as a critical resistance level. However, with its falling wedge breakout and technical improvements, market confidence is building. For long-term holders, Polkadot offers strong fundamentals with the potential for substantial growth as adoption rises. Its ongoing evolution positions it as a network worth watching among next-generation blockchain projects. Key Insights Both Ethereum Classic (ETC) price prediction and Polkadot potential offer opportunities for short-term gains, but their long-term growth hinges on further ecosystem advancements. While ETC shows promise with a possible 20% price surge, and Polkadot’s upgrades hint at scalability breakthroughs, they face strong competition in the market. In contrast, BlockDAG stands out among top crypto assets with its long-term value tied to real-world adoption. The activation of its Inter Milan partnership at San Siro Stadium positions it for global recognition, driving demand for BDAG coins. Combined with its innovative technology and presale milestones, BlockDAG is primed for sustained growth.

The snapshot shows a difference between Bitcoin and other major assets, with BTC holdings declining 8.55% to 50,412 BTC since the November 13 report. However, Ethereum and stablecoin holdings experienced substantial growth. Ethereum assets increased by 8.11% to 525,641 ETH, and USDT holdings surged by 29.77% to reach 4.11 billion. The exchange maintains healthy reserve ratios across its supported assets, with most cryptocurrencies showing coverage above 100%. This indicates Bybit holds more assets in its wallets than required to cover all user deposits, with some tokens like USDC showing reserve ratios as high as 128%. Bitcoin holdings decline as ETH gains momentum The most important change in Bybit’s reserves comes from Bitcoin holdings, which dropped by 4,711 BTC from the previous month to 50,412 BTC. Despite this reduction in user assets, Bybit maintains a healthy 115% reserve ratio for Bitcoin, meaning the exchange holds 58,283 BTC in its wallet assets compared to user deposits. Source: Wu Blockchain In contrast, Ethereum has shown growth, with user assets increasing by 39,441 ETH to reach 525,641 ETH. The exchange maintains a 106% reserve ratio for ETH, with wallet assets of 558,467 ETH. The changing trends between Bitcoin and Ethereum holdings might show the changing user preferences and market dynamics. While Bitcoin’s reserve ratio remains strong at 115%, the reduction in overall holdings could indicate users taking profits during Bitcoin’s recent price rally or diversifying into other assets. Stablecoin dominance in reserve growth Bybit’s stablecoin reserves have shown growth, led by USDT’s increase of 944.3 million to reach 4.11 billion in user assets. This 29.77% surge represents the largest percentage increase among major assets on the platform. The exchange maintains a 103% reserve ratio for USDT, with wallet assets of 4.27 billion USDT. Other stablecoins show similar metrics. USDC maintains the highest reserve ratio among all assets at 128%, with user assets of 148.87 million and wallet assets of 190.80 million. USDE shows a perfect balance with a 100% reserve ratio, holding 533.99 million in both user assets and wallet assets. MNT has also shown growth, with user assets increasing by 71.50 million to reach 362.44 million, a 24.58% increase. MNT maintains a healthy 119% reserve ratio, with wallet assets of 432.89 million. Diverse asset reserve ratios Bybit’s proof of reserves reveals consistently strong coverage across its wide range of supported cryptocurrencies. Meme coins show particularly strong ratios, with Dogecoin (DOGE) maintaining a 118% reserve ratio and Shiba Inu (SHIB) at 108%. In practical terms, this means Bybit holds 1.83 billion DOGE in wallet assets against 1.55 billion in user deposits and 4.50 trillion SHIB against 4.13 trillion in user assets. Layer-1 blockchain tokens show similarly healthy metrics. Solana (SOL) maintains a 104% ratio with 3.15 million tokens in wallet assets, while Polkadot (DOT) shows a strong 112% coverage with 14.10 million tokens backing user deposits. Among DeFi tokens, Uniswap (UNI) stands out with a 117% reserve ratio, holding 4.41 million tokens against 3.74 million in user assets. The reserve data also highlights the exchange’s strong position in other categories. Gaming tokens like SAND maintain a 109% ratio, while newer protocols such as RENDER and SHRAP both show 117% and 119% ratios, respectively.

38010962,https://btc-pulse.com/?p=27825,1734969660,Russia’s Kaspersky Warns Scammers Post Crypto Wallet Seed Phrases on YouTube to Steal Funds,"Scammers Hijack YouTube Comments with Seed Phrase Tricks Scammers have started to increasingly exploit YouTube’s comments feature to scam cryptocurrency owners. By posting seed phrases accompanying very fake pleas for help, they get individuals to engage multi-signature wallets designed to actually steal their funds. Kaspersky’s latest findings have brought this to the fore and called for vigilance. How the Scam Unfolds The scam starts innocently enough, with the scammers playing the rookie. They leave comments under YouTube videos of finance-related content, claiming not to be able to access their wallets and providing a seed phrase for help. For some, the bait is simply too irresistible: a wallet full of Tether-but nobody can access it without more TRON to pay for transaction fees. Unknowing victims start sending TRX to this wallet, only to realize their tokens are instantly forwarded to some other address. The multi-signature wallet is created so slyly that whatever the victim transfers is retained by the scammer. Community Reactions and Expert Warnings These scams haven’t gone unnoticed in the wider crypto community. Notably, CEO Changpeng Zhao of Binance has issued warnings to users against engaging any wallet that requests private keys or seed phrases, as such cases usually end in theft. His statements align with the findings presented by Kaspersky and are a call for crypto users to be security conscious. Key Takeaways from Kaspersky Analysts at Kaspersky’s cybersecurity have underlined this scam as particularly insidious because of the way it uses the technical difficulty of multi-signature wallets to hoodwink the targets. Their recommendations include: Never share the seed phrases: These are your wallet keys, and it should remain confidential. Look out for suspicious comments requesting help involving a seed phrase. Verify wallet authenticity: A wallet is a configuration that is supposed to be understood in advance of use. Global Impact and Sanctions The report comes as Kaspersky itself is under scrutiny on the global stage. This June, the U.S. imposed sanctions on 12 of its top executives at Kaspersky over cybersecurity concerns. Those moves came after accusations that the company had threatened national security, further complicating its efforts to warn people about scams like these. Protect Yourself Against Crypto Fraud This is one clear evidence that crypto scams will stop at nothing, literally growing in their methods of deception day by day. Indeed, the user must be very cautious, more so when some comment in their posts seems too good to be true. Keep wallet security a priority; remember, no valid entity will ask for your seed phrase.

Data from NASDAQ revealed that Palantir PLTR and Axon Enterprise AXON joined the Nasdaq 100 alongside MicroStrategy. They replaced Illumina (ILMN), Super Micro (SMCI), and Moderna (MRNA), with the reconstituted index set to begin trading on Dec. 23. NASDAQ 100 Gains Indirect BTC Exposure Notably, MSTR entered at the 52th position, accounting for about 0.42% of the total market capitalization of all companies in the index. Nasdaq noted that ETFs that track the Nasdaq 100 will automatically include MicroStrategy in their holdings. For instance, the Invesco QQQ ETF QQQ, a popular tech-focused fund with $320 billion in assets, will now acquire shares of MicroStrategy, regardless of investor preference. The inclusion of MicroStrategy in the Nasdaq 100 not only reflects the growing acceptance of cryptocurrency but also introduces new volatility to the index. Nasdaq noted that his shift could have extensive implications for both public markets and the broader ETF sector. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart had previously predicted that the inclusion could lead to an influx of around $2.1 billion in buying activity from ETFs that track the Nasdaq-100. Remarkably, the company’s stock has surged around 476% this year, with shares gaining momentum alongside Bitcoin’s price movements. MSTR stock reached a record high of around $473 on November 20, when Bitcoin traded above $92,000. MSTR Buys More BTC Besides, recently, MicroStrategy has increased its holdings for the seventh consecutive week. The company bought 5,262 BTC for a total of $561 million in the week ended Dec. 22 to take its total holdings to 444,262 BTC. The latest acquisitions were funded by share sales under the company’s at-the-market program (ATM). MicroStrategy has $7.08 billion left on the ATM program. This news was announced right after MSTR was added to the Nasdaq 100 index. Originally an enterprise software company, MicroStrategy pivoted in 2020 under its founder, Michael Saylor, who has embraced Bitcoin with firm commitment. The company continues to acquire more Bitcoin, betting its entire business on the cryptocurrency’s future. Bitcoin is up about 120% this year due to rising adoption. Moreover, President-elect Trump’s plans to create a U.S. bitcoin strategic reserve has further fueled the enthusiasm of crypto bulls.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/microstrategy-debuts-on-nasdaq-100-boosting-bitcoin-exposure-and-etf-inflows/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

According to DeFi Llama , Solana’s ( SOL ) protocols in the decentralized exchange industry were the most active in December. Its volume rose to over $97 billion, much higher than the $22.6 billion it handled in the same period last year. Notably, it was the third consecutive month that Solana outperformed Ethereum ( ETH ), which has dominated the industry for years. Ethereum’s protocols had a volume of over $74 billion, while Base and Arbitrum handled $42 billion and $37 billion. Solana DEX volume | Source: DeFi Llama Solana also performed great in November, where its DEX networks had a volume of $129 billion, higher than Ethereum’s $70.6 billion. A month earlier, Solana handled volume of $52 billion, while Ethereum processed $41 billion.

All Solana meme coins have a market cap of over $14.1 billion , led by Bonk, Dogwifhat, Popcat, and Peanut the Squirrel. This growth has been highly profitable for Solana and its native apps. All Solana native dApps generated a record $365 million in revenue in November, a record high. Similarly, according to TokenTerminal, Solana’s blockchain generated a record $725 million in fees in 2024, making it the third-most profitable chain after Ethereum and Tron. Developers and users love Solana because of its substantially lower fees and higher throughput. Base, the layer-2 network launched by Coinbase, has also been a big breakout star in 2024 as its total fees rose to over $82 million. It has become the biggest layer 2 network in the blockchain industry, with its DEX networks handling over $181 billion in assets, while its total value locked soared to $2 billion.

Expert Reveals SOL Flashing Buy Signal appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Solana (SOL), the world’s fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has experienced a notable price decline in recent days. Solana (SOL) Flashing Buy Signal, Expert Says Amid this continuous price drop, a prominent crypto expert posted on X (previously Twitter) that the technical indicator TD Sequential is flashing a buy signal for Solana (SOL) on its daily time frame. The TD Sequential presents a buy signal on the #Solana $SOL daily chart, anticipating a price rebound! pic.twitter.com/FMhtsQxTt5 — Ali (@ali_charts) December 23, 2024 Solana (SOL) Price Action and Upcoming Level According to expert technical analysis, SOL has recently broken out from its crucial support level and is currently receiving support from the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA). This support from the 200 EMA could play a crucial role for SOL and determine whether the altcoin will rally or face a price decline in the future. Source: Trading View Currently, SOL appears to be consolidating within a tight range between $175 and $188 over the past two trading days. Based on recent price action, if SOL holds above the 200 EMA, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 30% to reach the $240 mark in the near future. Conversely, if SOL fails to maintain this support level and closes a daily candle below the $175 mark, it could drop by 30% to reach the $120 level. $105 Million Outflow from Exchanges Amid this challenging phase, long-term holders have shown strong interest in SOL, according to the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass. Data from SOL spot inflow/outflow reveals that exchanges across the cryptocurrency market have witnessed an outflow of a significant $105.5 million worth of SOL in the past three days. This substantial outflow indicates potential upside momentum and suggests an ideal opportunity to add SOL. Current Price Momentum Currently, SOL is trading near $182.3 and has experienced a modest price increase of over 0.5% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, the altcoin’s trading volume dropped by 5%, indicating reduced participation from traders and investors amid market uncertainty.",POSITIVE,SOL,ALTCOIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/time-to-buy-solana-expert-reveals-sol-flashing-buy-signal/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Donald Saves Crypto (DONALCRY), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONALCRY is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald Saves Crypto can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald Saves Crypto could become the next viral memecoin. Donald Saves Crypto launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald Saves Crypto on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald Saves Crypto by entering its contract address – Gyy3ss5Yj2ioZWuz6BNbDPGUGUxhwoCskRuU2cGo9k2Q – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONALCRY. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/donald-saves-crypto-donalcry-will-explode-over-18000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png
38010908,https://coinpedia.org/?p=396757,1734969542,Ripple News: Gary Cardone Says Brad Garlinghouse Failed XRP Investors on ‘60 Minutes’,"The post Ripple News: Gary Cardone Says Brad Garlinghouse Failed XRP Investors on ‘60 Minutes’ appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse appeared in a recent 60 Minutes interview, which provided exposure for both Ripple and the broader cryptocurrency industry. However, the interview also faced criticism for including comments from John Reed Stark, a vocal critic of crypto, who dismissed it as a scam with no utility. His views align with those of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, and many felt they were presented without proper counterpoints. Garlinghouse later took to social media and pointed out that 60 Minutes failed to mention a federal judge’s ruling that XRP is not a security. He also said that the program overlooked the SEC’s legal setbacks and meetings between Gensler and FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried. These omissions sparked concerns about potential bias in the reporting. On the Good Morning Crypto Show, Gary Cardone of Cardone Digital Ventures shared his thoughts on Garlinghouse’s appearance on 60 Minutes, saying he’d rather speak his truth than worry about how it’s edited. He pointed out that Ripple paid for the interview, which likely cost millions, and questioned why Garlinghouse would let it be edited in a way that made him look bad. Cardone argued that if Garlinghouse couldn’t control the interview, it raised doubts about his leadership. He also criticized the marketing strategy, saying it failed as an investment. Cardone admitted that he bought XRP, expecting Garlinghouse to perform better. However, he remains uncertain about holding it long-term. He also mentioned that when he asked Ripple-related questions, he never received answers, particularly about why Ripple doesn’t replicate MicroStrategy’s strategy of buying and holding assets like XRP. However, despite these issues, Garlinghouse considered the appearance a success for Ripple, as it showed the company’s legitimate use of XRP for cross-border transactions and brought to attention the growing recognition of blockchain technology.",NEGATIVE,XRP,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | XRP,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/ripple-news-gary-cardone-says-brad-garlinghouse-failed-xrp-investors-on-60-minutes/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png
38010910,https://crypto.news/?p=14319119,1734969480,"Blockchain developer market becomes more centralized post-FTX, data shows","The blockchain developer ecosystem is shifting: fewer developers are entering the space, and experienced developers are dominating the work, Electric Capital’s research report shows. Blockchain developers are key to the crypto industry. They build apps and tools that attract users and create value. More users bring more developers, therefore creating a cycle of growth. Yet, despite crypto’s focus on decentralization, the developer market appears to become more centralized, with experienced developers taking the lead, per Electric Capital’s recent research report . Table of Contents Fewer active developers Established developers gain share Where developers live Developers diversify across chains Use cases expand What this means for space Fewer active developers The total number of active blockchain developers has dropped sharply. In November 2022, there were over 31,000 active developers. By November 2024, the number had dropped to 23,160, a 25% decline in two years. Total monthly active developers | Source: Electric Capital Part-time developers were hit the hardest. Their numbers dropped from 16,600 in November 2022 to 12,386 in November 2024. Newcomer developers also saw a sharp decline: in November 2022, there were 18,547 newcomers when two years later, the number dropped by over half to just 8,986. In contrast, established developers (those with two or more years of experience) are growing. During the same period, there were 6,903 established developers, and this number grew to 11,400 in just two years, a 65% increase. Andrew Morfill, CIO of Zodia Custody, an institution-first digital asset custodian backed by Standard Chartered, says the decline in part-time and new blockchain developers “can likely be attributed to factors such as market volatility and/or increasing complexity due to market maturation.” “This complexity requires a deeper understanding of the technology, which can be daunting to newcomers. At the same time, this trend shows a consolidation of developers already in the market committing and staying. It is also being seen in institutional customers, where those already in the market are doubling down, while new entrants are still at the fringes with the tipping point for the next wave of adoption yet to be fully realized.” Andrew Morfill in the conversation with crypto.news Morfill suggested that developer activity typically lags behind broader market price trends, predicting that the current decline “will likely reverse in the first half of 2025.” He also noted that while fewer new developers might “slow the influx of fresh ideas and diverse perspectives,” the continued presence of experienced developers could foster an environment where “newcomers and part-timers have strong mentors and robust frameworks to build upon.” Meanwhile, Francesco Andreolí, head of the developer community at Consensys, attributed the decline in part-time and new developers to the “increasingly technical demands of blockchain projects,” which Andreolí claims “often require specialized knowledge and sustained commitment.” “To counter this, more education, mentorship, and beginner-friendly tools are needed to attract the next wave of web3 talent and make the maturing industry more accessible. Striking a balance between leveraging experienced developers and fostering fresh talent is crucial.” Francesco Andreolí in the conversation with crypto.news Andreolí also highlighted the importance of ecosystem maturity and accessibility in blockchain development, noting that while the tooling for blockchain development is improving, it often “lacks the polish and simplicity of more mature ecosystems,” which makes it challenging for part-time developers to contribute effectively. To address this, Andreolí pointed out that “we are building pre-built environments like CLIs to make onboarding easier for new developers and recreate optimal web2 developer experiences, thereby lowering barriers to entry.” The head of developer community at Consensys also emphasized the need to combat the perception of exclusivity in blockchain development, which he said can “alienate newcomers, particularly those without a deep technical background.” He advocated for fostering inclusivity and creating tools that “democratize access to blockchain development,” stressing that these steps are vital for nurturing innovation and diversity essential to the industry’s long-term growth. Established developers gain share Electric Capital’s “2024 Developer Report,” which analyzed 902 million code commits across 1.7 million repositories, shows the growing influence of experienced developers. Established developers (those in crypto for 2+ years) are at all-time highs, growing 27% YoY and committing 70% of code commits, the report reads. Active developers by tenure | Source: Electric Capital This means that while the overall developer count is falling, experienced developers are taking a bigger share of the work. The report also found that 39,148 new developers explored crypto in 2024, though this growth among newcomers is not enough to offset the loss of part-time developers and those leaving the industry. Andreolí cautioned that the shift could centralize influence among a small group of contributors, creating risks for the ecosystem. “The fragmentation of ecosystems — with developers needing different skills, such as Rust for some chains and Solidity for others — creates additional barriers to collaboration and broader participation.” Francesco Andreolí Andreolí also expressed concerns about the potential “homogenization of innovation,” noting that an over-reliance on experienced developers might lead to “solutions shaped by established paradigms, potentially stifling the creativity that comes from new entrants and diverse backgrounds.” This, he suggested, could stifle the creativity often brought by newcomers and individuals from diverse backgrounds. To mitigate these challenges, Andreolí underscored the importance of fostering cross-chain collaboration through open-source projects, community-driven governance, and tools that promote permissionless innovation, emphasizing that such efforts “activate developers within communities, enabling them to become an integral part of the developer experience.” At the same time, Morfill believes that the growing dominance of experienced developers is a “natural sign of the industry’s maturation,” adding though that “decentralized development is somewhat of a myth, given the small number of people running some of the entities at the core of the web3 and DeFi ecosystem.” “Projects such as Solana provide an excellent gateway for the next wave of adoption for developers — as well as projects and institutions — with ecosystems built around core entities, projects and protocols being key in 2025. This also means that cross-chain capability and interoperability will feature heavily and become paramount for projects and entities wanting to scale.” Andrew Morfill Where developers live Blockchain development is global. Asia now leads in developer share. North America, once the top region, has fallen to third place. The U.S. remains the top country for blockchain developers, with 18.8% of the global share, though it is a big drop from 38% in 2015. Breakdown by type | Source: Electric Capital India is emerging as a leader. In 2024, the country onboarded the most new developers, accounting for 11.7% of the global share. Other countries with significant developer bases include the U.K. (4.3%), China (4%), and Canada (3.8%). Developers diversify across chains Developers are working on more blockchain ecosystems than ever before. In 2015, fewer than 10% of developers worked on multiple chains. However, by 2024, one in three developers now work across multiple chains.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin ( BTC ) development remains stable, with 42% of developers working on scaling solutions. Use cases expand Different blockchains attract developers based on specific use cases: Ethereum: Leads in total developer activity and remains a hub for decentralized finance. Solana: Dominates decentralized exchange usage and is a leader (64%) in low-fee use cases like NFT/meme coins minting. Coinbase’s Base: Responsible for 42% of the “new code being written in the Ethereum ecosystem” and owns 97% of NFT minting volume. Stablecoins and re-staking are also growing sectors. Stablecoins now have over $195 billion in circulating supply and more than $80 billion in daily transaction volume. The re-staking sector, led by projects like EigenLayer, grew its full-time developer count by 130% in 2024, the report shows. You might also like: Crypto’s next big thing isn’t meme coins, it’s stablecoins What this means for space While the shift toward experienced developers shows that the industry is maturing, it also raises concerns about centralization. As newcomers decline and established developers dominate, the industry could become less diverse. This trend also reflects broader market challenges. The 7% decline in total developers in 2024 indicates that some are leaving due to market uncertainty or fewer opportunities, especially following the significant blow dealt by the FTX collapse . The bankruptcy’s ripple effects continue to impact the industry even today. Electric Capital’s report describes developers as a “leading indicator of value creation,” emphasizing that a decline in developer participation could hamper blockchain innovation over time.

Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy executive chairman, announced the company bought 5,262 Bitcoin ( BTC ) for $561 million at an average price of $106,662 before the recent market correction. The Virginia-based software company now holds 444,262 BTC, reinforcing its lead as the top institutional Bitcoin holder. With an initial investment of $27.7 billion, MicroStrategy recorded nearly $15 billion in unrealized profits at the time of writing, despite last week’s cryptocurrency market downturn. 24-hour BTC price chart – Dec. 23 | Source: crypto.news You might also like: Crypto hedge funds set records, Saylor proposes Bitcoin reserve, Riot Platform raises over $594m | Weekly Recap Replies from skeptics citing Bitcoin’s current price versus MicroStrategy’s buying price flooded Saylor’s weekly announcement on X. Following hawkish from the Federal Reserve, a market-wide correction saw BTC trading below $95,000 at press time. Critics, including U.S. stockbroker and economist Peter Schiff, took aim at Saylor’s approach, referring to the latest purchase as the firm’s smallest in seven weeks. Schiff argued that MicroStrategy should focus on buying the dip to maximize shareholder value. It seems like you are running out of firepower to keep propping up Bitcoin. Plus, not only is this your smallest buy, but the first time your average purchase price has been above the market price on the Monday you disclosed the buy. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) December 23, 2024 In addition to the Bitcoin purchase, MicroStrategy disclosed in a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it had sold approximately 1.32 million shares of MSTR convertible notes, raising over $7 billion. The funds are reportedly intended for further Bitcoin acquisitions. While Saylor announced the smallest purchase in seven weeks, Metaplanet, hailed as Japan’s MicroStrategy, unveiled its biggest BTC buy yet.

38010773,https://crypto.news/?p=14321610,1734969202,"AAVE price rises as smart money buys, exchange balances falls","AAVE price rebounded for the second consecutive day, erasing some losses from last week, as smart money investors bought in and exchange balances declined. AAVE ( AAVE ), the largest lending protocol in the crypto industry, climbed to $341 on Monday, Dec. 23, marking a 25% increase from its lowest level last week. This recovery pushed the token’s market cap to over $5 billion. The rally was not driven by any specific AAVE-related news but seemed tied to the broader rebound in DeFi tokens. Curve DAO Token ( CRV ) rose by 10%, while Raydium ( RAY ) was up by 5%. Other leading DeFi tokens, such as Chainlink and Lido DAO, also saw upward momentum. AAVE’s performance was further supported by its strong fundamentals. It remains the second-largest player in the DeFi industry, managing over $19.6 billion in assets across chains like Ethereum, Polygon, and Arbitrum.

AAVE exchange balances | Source: Nansen Nansen data also highlighted increased activity among smart money investors, with the number of smart money AAVE holders rising to nearly 50, up from fewer than 30 in June. Smart money balances now exceed 430,000 tokens, up from a year-to-date low of under 340,000. This accumulation is generally considered a bullish signal for a cryptocurrency. AAVE smart money investors | Source: Nansen Donald Trump’s World Liberty Financial has become a big buyer of the AAVE token. It owns over 6,000 coins valued at over $2 million, making it the fourth biggest part of its portfolio after Ethereum, Bitcoin, and USDC. The company also wants to build its DeFi network on top of AAVE’s platform . AAVE price technicals point to more upside AAVE price chart | Source: crypto.news Technicals suggest that the AAVE token has more upside to go in the next few days. The coin formed a hammer candlestick chart pattern on Dec. 20 as cryptocurrencies fell. A hammer forms during a downtrend and comprises a long lower shadow and a small body. Additionally, AAVE has found support at its 50-day moving average and is approaching the weak, stop, & reverse level of the Murrey Math Lines.

According to a report by blockchain security platform Immunefi , hacks were overwhelmingly the primary cause, accounting for $1.47 billion or 98.1% of the total losses across 192 incidents. Fraud, including rug pulls and scams, represented just 1.9% of the losses at $28 million, though this category saw a 72% increase year-on-year. Number of Successful Attacks Fell by 27% The decline in total crypto losses reflects improved security measures, as the number of successful attacks also fell by 27.5%, from 320 in 2023 to 232 in 2024. The report identified two high-profile incidents as the year’s largest losses. Japan’s DMM Bitcoin exchange suffered a $305 million private key breach in May, while WazirX, India’s top crypto exchange, lost $235 million in July after hackers compromised its Ethereum-based multisig wallet. Together, these two events accounted for 36% of the total losses. In 2024, hackers stole $2.2 billion from cryptocurrencies, a 21% increase from last year. Big hits include $305M from Japan's DMM Bitcoin and $235M from India’s WazirX. North Korea stole $1.3B to avoid sanctions. Most attacks targeted big platforms. #CryptoTips #TradeSmart … pic.twitter.com/Wo4ZhLOv0s — Fiona K (@Fiona_Kzh) December 20, 2024 Decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols remained prime targets, representing 51.4% of the losses, while centralized finance (CeFi) platforms accounted for 48.6%. Notably, CeFi losses surged by 77.5% year-on-year, reaching $726 million. Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain were the most attacked blockchains, with Ethereum facing 104 incidents that led to 44% of total chain losses. The report also highlighted the significant role of North Korean-linked hacking groups, responsible for $285 million in losses through sophisticated attacks on platforms like WazirX and Radiant Capital. Their techniques ranged from social engineering to malware-laced PDFs targeting developers. Q2 2024 Was Most Damaging On a quarterly basis, Q2 2024 was the most damaging, with losses reaching $572.6 million, driven by major incidents at DMM Bitcoin and BtcTurk. Q4 recorded the least losses at $150.5 million, reflecting improved resilience during the year. Despite the staggering numbers, $115.6 million was recovered in 14 incidents, representing 7.7% of the stolen funds. For instance, Munchables successfully retrieved $62.8 million after the developer disclosed the compromised private keys, while Thala recovered its $25.5 million loss through law enforcement intervention. “Despite progress in making crypto safer, particularly in terms of hacks per dollar, the sector still faces significant challenges,” Mitchell Amador, CEO of Immunefi, commented. “The stakes are high, and we will also witness an unprecedented surge in security advancements, with AI-powered tools and decentralized security solutions becoming essential in the fight to safeguard the ecosystem.” Just recently, New Zealand’s Financial Markets Authority (FMA) issued a warning about an increasing wave of crypto scams targeting social media users. The watchdog said that the fraudsters operate primarily through YouTube channels and messaging platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram, where they lure unsuspecting users with promises of lucrative investment opportunities. In a separate incident, Nigeria’s Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has arrested 792 individuals in connection with an alleged large-scale crypto romance scam. The arrests took place on December 10 at a building in Lagos, Nigeria’s largest city, suspected to be a major hub for fraudulent activities.

The conversation gained traction when widely followed influencer Wall Street Mav tweeted , “The second-largest donor to the Democrats might receive an early pardon from President Biden,” referring to SBF.Elon Musk ReactsThe tweet has garnered over 1.1 million views, attracting commentaries from various prominent figures like Elon Musk.In response to the speculation, Musk remarked that the real surprise would be if the rumor were untrue. “I will be shocked if this doesn’t happen,” he stated.Musk’s comment aligns with his skepticism toward the current administration. A vocal critic of several policies and decisions by the Biden administration, Musk has frequently expressed his distrust.Notably, during the recent presidential election, Musk openly supported the opposition, led by Donald Trump , who ultimately secured the presidency. Trump will take office next month, promising significant policy shifts from the outgoing administration.https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1871091667518071173Bankman-Fried CrimesNotably, Bankman-Fried orchestrated a multi-billion-dollar fraud involving misappropriating customer funds. He faced charges including wire fraud, securities fraud, commodities fraud, money laundering, and campaign finance violations. He received a sentence of 25 years in prison in March 2024, in addition to three years of supervised release, with the judge ordering him to forfeit $11 billion.Now, due to his strong ties with the ruling class, particularly through his campaign donations, speculation is circulating in the crypto community that he could receive an early pardon.Can President Biden Pardon SBF?The U.S. president has the constitutional power to grant pardons for federal offenses. They include those related to drug offenses, financial crimes, tax evasion, and other violations of federal law.Since SBF faced conviction for orchestrating a fraud involving the misappropriation of customer funds and other crimes under U.S. federal law, he would be eligible for a pardon.Meanwhile, despite the online chatter, prediction markets paint a different picture. Polymarket, a decentralized platform for trading on real-world events, places the probability of President Biden pardoning SBF at only about 5%. This suggests that most market participants view this as a long shot.Notably, just two weeks ago, President Joe Biden granted clemency, which included pardons for 39 individuals and reductions of sentences for 1,499 others.",NEUTRAL,없음,MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/23/elon-musk-reacts-to-talks-of-sbf-receiving-presidential-pardon/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=elon-musk-reacts-to-talks-of-sbf-receiving-presidential-pardon,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

A developer claimed that the console’s hardware is ‘very capable’ and that many will be “pleasantly surprised.” The Switch 2 has long been the talk of the gaming industry. Some alleged designs of the second edition were also leaked . Nintendo confirmed it was in development some time ago. They even suggested that it would be announced by March 2025. However, a developer has revealed more details for fans who are awaiting the big reveal. It is still to be seen whether these claims are true. On the InstallBase forums , a user known as a “trusted developer,” Matt, posted something very important regarding the successor of Nintendo’s console. A user told him Switch 2 wouldn’t be far off from the PlayStation 4 in terms of performance. In reply, he said that Nintendo’s flagship device “is very capable,” and a lot of people are going to be “pleasantly surprised.” Fans had expected the Switch 2 to be introduced with inferior hardware. Therefore, Matt’s claim suggests that it has more. Switch 2’s large potential user base would be very lucrative for third-party developers. Matt added that Nintendo and third-party developers have fully embraced Switch 2 as a real growth opportunity. This means that in launch season, it can have major AAA games. However, Matt says it won’t have many big titles every year. He also said that, given the current market scenarios, more third-party developers would want to make games for the Switch 2. Given its large potential user base, this would be very lucrative for third-party developers. Earlier hardware information was also leaked, claiming that the Switch 2 could have 12GB of RAM. Matt explained that the comparison to the Xbox Series S was “incredibly misplaced.” This is because both these consoles have differences in design and usage, and Switch 2 can be more portable. This makes the comparison of the two consoles unfair and misleading.

Gabriel Hay, Gavin Mayo Arrested For NFT Rug Pull Schemes According to a Friday press release , Hay and Mayo allegedly created misleading project roadmaps for a number of NFT projects between May 2021 and May 2024, including Vault of Gems, Faceless, Sinful Souls, Clout Coin, Dirty Dogs, Uncovered, MoonPortal, Squiggles, and Roost Coin. Two California NFT promoters charged with wire fraud after allegedly orchestrating a $22M rug pull, misleading investors with false project roadmaps. Gabriel Hay and Gavin Mayo face serious legal repercussions after abandoning their projects. $NFT — CryptoEdge (@EdGeraldX) December 23, 2024 The two 23 year olds reportedly undertook promotional activities for several NFT projects before ultimately abandoning them, leading to their arrest by Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) on the 20. “For three years, Hay and Mayo apparently lied to their investors in order to defraud them out of millions of dollars,” said HSI Executive Associate Director Katrina W. Berger. “Such technological fraud schemes cost investors millions of dollars every year. Just because such crimes aren’t violent does not mean they are victimless.” Crypto Scammers Threatened Project Manager In one instance, the purported crypto scammers falsely claimed that the Vault of Gems would be the “first NFT project to be pegged to a hard asset.” The duo attempted to conceal their involvement in the illegitimate scheme “by falsely identifying other individuals or causing other individuals to be falsely identified as owners of the projects.” When a Faceless NFT project manager threatened to expose Hay and Mayo’s role in the fraud, the two Los Angeles area natives harassed and intimidated the unnamed individual and their family, causing significant emotional distress. “Gabriel Hay and Gavin Mayo allegedly defrauded investors in digital asset projects of tens of millions of dollars and threatened an individual who attempted to expose their roles in these fraudulent schemes,” said Principal Deputy Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri, head of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “The department is committed to protecting investors and will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to root out fraud involving cryptocurrency and other digital assets and bring offenders to justice,” he added. Hay and Mayo have each been charged with one count of stalking, two counts of wire fraud, and one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. The two are facing a maximum penalty of two decades in prison on the conspiracy and wire fraud charges as well as an additional five years behind bars for stalking.

Ethereum ( ETH ) traded at $3,340 on Monday as cryptocurrencies stabilized. This was slightly up from last week’s low of $3,100. Seasonality data suggests that Ethereum price may rebound sharply in the first quarter of 2025. According to CoinGlass , ETH had positive returns in all but two first quarters since 2017. Its best performance was in 2017, when it jumped by 518%, followed by 202,1 when it rose by 160%. Its average first-quarter returns since 2017 were 92%, making it the best period of the year. The second quarter is its best quarter, followed by Q4. The third quarter is usually the worst period for cryptocurrencies, likely because of the summer season. Ethereum quarrterly returns | Source: CoinGlass More data shows that Ethereum rises in the first four months after a US election. Its average returns in the first four months of Donald Trump’s administration was about 90%. Similarly, in 2021, its four-month return after Biden became president was $41.

Spot ETH ETFs are seeing strong accumulations by investors, with their cumulative inflows rising to over $2.33 billion. Ethereum’s network has made over $2.44 billion in fees this year, making it the second-most profitable network after Tether. The network remains dominant in the decentralized finance industry, with a total value of $66 billion, higher than most ten chains combined. The other potential catalyst for Ethereum price is that its futures open interest has dropped to $23 billion from the year-to-date high of $28 billion. The last time its open interest was this low was in November, and the coin bounced back to $4,000. ETH futures open interest | Source: CoinGlass Ethereum price technical analysis ETH price chart | Source: crypto.news The weekly chart shows that Ether has strong technicals as it has remained above the ascending trendline that connects the lowest swings since May 2022. It has also moved slightly above the 50-week moving average and the first support of Andrew’s pitchfork tool. Therefore, Ethereum price will likely bounce back in the next few months. A complete bullish breakout will be confirmed if the coin rises above the triple-top chart pattern at $4,027 . A move above that level will point to more gains to the all-time high of $4,860, its all-time high.

38010052,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=666467,1734967816,Expert Reveals Top 15 Crypto Predictions For 2025 You Need To Know,"In a thread on X, Hitesh Malviya, co-founder of DYOR—a free on-chain analytics platform—unveiled his set of crypto predictions for the year 2025. Malviya outlines pivotal trends and shifts expected to shape the crypto landscape. Below are the top 15 predictions that stakeholders and enthusiasts should closely monitor. Top 15 Crypto Predictions For 2025 #1 US Regulation Of the Crypto Market In 2025 Malviya anticipates the formalization of the United States’ regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies by 2025. “The US crypto regulation framework has been under discussion for the past two years, but we’re yet to see any approval on it,” he states. He further predicts that during the Trump presidency, favorable regulations will emerge, significantly bolstering sectors with robust cash flows, particularly decentralized finance (DeFi). #2 Sustained Memecoin Popularity Despite anticipated regulatory interventions, Malviya expects the memecoin sector to regain its momentum. “Most of the memes will eventually have a short term hit when the regulation framework is introduced in the USA, as I don’t see them becoming part of it,” he explains. He further forecasts that regulation will “eventually create a clear divide between hyperspeculative trading assets and assets with some sort of fundamental value associated with them.” Nonetheless, like in 2024, the “majority of people will choose memes over fundamentally backed assets, even if they are not recognized by the government,” Malviya predicts, adding, “meme mania will only grow—more participants will join in the hope of changing their lives. The casino will only get bigger with time.” #3 Expansion Of Hyperspeculative Markets Beyond memecoins, Malviya foresees significant growth in hyperspeculative markets, particularly within prediction markets for events, news, affairs and almost everything. “Memes are not the most hyper-speculative market that crypto offers—prediction markets are the bigger fish in the pond. Prediction market platforms like Polymarket will eventually capture the largest audience in 2025,” he notes. #4 DeFi Renaissance A resurgence in DeFi is a cornerstone of Malviya’s predictions. He projects that DeFi will become a focal point for mature investors, with total value locked (TVL) in DeFi protocols surpassing $250 billion by the end of 2025. “Money markets like AAVE will eventually attract more TVL,” Malviya asserted, highlighting the role of Donald Trump’s crypto project World Liberty Financial as a key growth catalyst. “Some DeFi coins will also hit $30B-$50B market caps next year,” the expert added.

Top Exec Discusses The Market Crash #5 On-Chain Commodities Trading The integration of commodities into blockchain ecosystems is expected to gain traction. Malviya forecasts, “Different types of commodities will eventually be offered for trading on many DEXs in 2025.” Ostium Labs is identified by the expert as an early mover in this domain, with expectations that numerous projects will launch on-chain commodity trading platforms. #6 Stablecoin Market Cap Reaches $500 Billion The stablecoin sector is poised for substantial growth, with Malviya forecasting a market capitalization of $500 billion. “Many new stablecoins will eventually capture some market share from big players like USDC and USDT,” he remarked. The Reserve Protocol, facilitating asset-backed stablecoins, is singled out as a promising initiative within this expansion. #7 Rise of AI Art NFTs Artificial Intelligence-driven art NFTs are projected to garner significant attention. “Some AI artists, like Refik Anadol, can steal the maximum attention from NFT art collectors next year,” Malviya predicts. He anticipates that AI Art NFT collections may achieve floor prices reaching 100 Ethereum (ETH). Related Reading: Bitwise Exec Reveals His Personal Top 3 Crypto Predictions For 2025 #8 Staking-Driven Airdrop Mechanisms Malviya forecasts that Polygon and EigenLayer are going to have a series of major token launches next year. “I am anticipating that Polygon and EigenLayer staking will probably bring a couple of ecosystem airdrops for holders,” he explained. #9 Peak And Decline Of Initial AI Offerings (IAOs) The initial phase of IAOs is expected to reach its zenith, followed by a contraction. “IAOs are currently going through the first phase,” Malviya noted, cautioning that oversaturation will lead to the decline of many AI agents. “Only a few agents with quality data training and a clear purpose will manage to survive the AI agent winter, which is going to happen at some point next year,” the expert cautions. #10 Perpetual Bull Market Perception Malviya suggests that the bull market will persist in perception but will not be as straightforward as in the past where every altcoin surged at the same time. “That’s the saddest part of this prediction list—most people will remain delusional about a bull market, just like they are now. The market’s nature will remain rotational for a few more months,” he stated. He foresees a major correction resembling a bear cycle, yet expects an unexpected recovery influenced by potential black swan events: “I am expecting a major correction, which might resemble a bear cycle in 2025, but it will surprise people with an unexpected recovery, aligned with some potential black swan events.” #11 Focus On Privacy-Based Projects Post-regulatory clarity under Trump, privacy-centric projects are projected to gain prominence. “Confidential transactions and private computation would become a necessity at some point,” Malviya emphasized. Projects like Nillion are expected to attract substantial attention within the DeFi and DeAI sectors, catering to the growing demand for privacy solutions. #12 SUI Surpassing Solana In Daily Transactions The SUI blockchain, leveraging the SocialFi narrative, is anticipated to eclipse Solana in daily transaction volumes. “SUI is currently cooking the SocialFi narrative. Most of the application activities on SUI come from their SocialFi app, which directly deals with the creator economy. I am expecting that some of the apps from SUI will eventually crack the creator economy code and bring the masses onchain, eventually surpassing Solana in daily transaction metrics.” #13 Intense Competition Among Alternative Virtual Machines (AltVMs) The battle among AltVMs is set to intensify, with Malviya identifying contenders like Monad, MegaETH, Berachain, HyperVM, Sonic, and Sei. “One of them will capture 75% of the market share within 12 months after launch,” he predicts, attributing success to community support and developer relationships. Malviya expresses a particular interest in MegaEth Labs as a potential market leader. #14 Mainstream Adoption Of Web3 Wallets Web3 wallets are expected to achieve mainstream status, facilitated by enhanced user onboarding and intuitive interfaces. “Web3 wallets are going to become super easy for onboarding and usage next year,” Malviya states. The emergence of super apps, alongside Web3 wallets from major exchanges like OKX and Binance, is projected to drive widespread adoption through mobile platforms. #15 DEXs Capturing 30% Of Trading Volume Finally, Malviya foresees decentralized exchanges (DEXs) substantially increasing their share of trading volumes. “DEX/CEX trading volume ratio sits at 15% right now. I am expecting it to double in the next 12 months,” he asserts. The shift towards on-chain trading is attributed to the advantages of self-custody and improved onboarding technologies like account abstraction, leading to an anticipated rise in on-chain user activity. At press time, Bitcoin traded at $96,139.

38010042,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/?p=26975,1734967806,Sonic Announces Airdrop to All Users Onboarded Through TikTok,"New York, NY, December 23rd, 2024, Chainwire SonicX, the first TikTok APP Layer developed by Sonic SVM, will airdrop $SONIC tokens to all eligible Tiktok users. Sonic SVM, the team behind SonicX, the TikTok App Layer and the hit tap-to-earn game , has announced that they will airdrop their $SONIC token to all users onboarded through TikTok. This initiative comes after Sonic has seen success onboarding over 2 million users through the TikTok applayer they have developed, and the latest initiative continues the effort to bring 1 billion TikTok users onto Web3. The TikTok onboarding success is attributed to two major factors: seamless onboarding and distribution. By utilizing account abstraction, TikTok users are not required to create and connect a web3 wallet – rather, they can log in with their TikTok account, and the wallet is automatically created. Transactions conducted within the app are gasless, allowing users to perform blockchain actions without signing transactions – providing a seamless Web2 app experience. Combined with account abstraction, the distribution strategy of Sonic has played a major role in the user conversion as well. Multiple members of Sonic, including CEO and co-founder Chris Zhu, has previous experience working at Bytedance – the parent company of TikTok – and utilizing their in-depth knowledge of the social media platform, as well as existing connections with the TikTok team and distribution partners has allowed them to fully tap into the full distribution potential for SonicX. SonicX deploys premium TikTok ads and partners with TikTok creators to have the platform’s algorithm recommend the campaign to users in target regions. Users can directly access Sonic X or Sonic’s TikTok via ad and video links. Sonic also utilizes the official Sonic SVM account for branded challenges, live streams and interactive games – building their TikTok corporate account as a central hub for gaming and blockchain education, providing users with simplified guides and tutorials. The airdrop snapshot has not been announced yet, and additional TikTok users are still able to visit official Sonic SVM account to access SonicX, qualifying for the upcoming airdrop. This initiative is parallel in comparison to the $TON ecosystem initiated by Telegram, a pioneer of the mini-game movement boasting 950 million monthly active users – with its native token $TON reaching a market cap of over $15 billion. In comparison, TikTok, with 1 billion monthly active users and a projected user base of 2.35 billion by 2029, represents a massive, largely untapped market for Web3 gaming, according to Shopify . Capitalizing on TikTok’s potential, SonicX surpassed 1 million players within a month of its debut, as reported by Decrypt’s GG . Sonic SVM aims to build a TikTok Chain through its App Layer, enabling seamless integration for other projects. Sonic recently announced its first game, Mahjong 123 , set to launch on SonicX.app , kicking off the expansion of its TikTok Chain ecosystem. The current campaign is the latest announcement signaling the upcoming Token Generation Event (TGE) where eligible users will receive token rewards through the airdrop. About Sonic SVM Sonic is the first SVM chain to launch on Solana, for games and applications. It is powered by Sonic HyperGrid, a framework for orchestrating optimistic Solana rollups. Sonic is the home of SonicX , industry’s first Web3 TikTok App Layer – designed to onboard the next billion users.

According to blockchain tracking firm Lookonchain, Hayes sent over $8.47 million worth of Ethena ( ENA ) to Binance, presumably to sell on the open market. “ Arthur Hayes previously accumulated 16.79 million ENA ($11.21 million) at $0.67 between Nov 26th and Nov 28th, making a profit of $7.7 million at the current price.” Source: Lookonchain/X According to blockchain “de-anonymizing” service Arkham, Hayes also sent an additional $2.42 million worth of ENA to another wallet containing over $11 million worth of crypto. Arkham notes that the receiving wallet may be owned by Hayes as well but the firm is not 100% certain. In a recent essay, Hayes said that the crypto markets could be at risk of witnessing a “harrowing” correction following the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump. “The people are impatient because they are desperate. Trump is an astute politician and knows his base. To me, that means he must go big early, which is why my money is on a massive dollar vs. gold devaluation early into his first 100 days in office. It is an easy way to make production costs globally competitive in America quickly. It will lead to an immediate re-shoring of productive capacity, leading to an increase in hiring today and not five years from now. Before we get to the crack-up-boom phase in this crypto bull market, I believe the crypto markets will experience a harrowing dump around Trump’s January 20th, 2025 inauguration day.

38010260,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=632349,1734967800,Bitcoin risks $20K crash as Dec closes: What to know about Bitcoin this week,"Bitcoin (BTC) continues to grapple with sustaining its position above crucial support levels following a weakened weekly close. As the holiday period approaches, BTC struggles are within the mid-$90,000 zone, with a bearish momentum dominating the current price action. The largest crypto by market cap has witnessed what many would call a woeful week after hitting an all-time high on December 17. However, analysts are hoping the festive week will change the coin’s outlook for the end of 2024, even though bears seem to hold crucial positions in the current market trading phase. Bitcoin intraday trading charts: Ascending consolidation and recent pullback In recent weeks, Bitcoin exhibited an ascending consolidation pattern around the $108,000 resistance region. This phase was disrupted by heightened selling pressure and distribution activity from large market participants, leading to a sharp 15% decline. The price found support at approximately $90,000, coinciding with the middle boundary of a long-standing bullish price channel. This zone represents a critical line of defense against deeper corrections. Bitcoin price chart | TradingView Technical analysis highlights that a rebound from the current support levels could pave the way for a renewed attempt to reclaim the $108,000 mark. Conversely, failure to maintain support may result in a more significant correction, with the channel’s lower boundary near $75,000 emerging as the next key support level. As seen on BTC’s daily chart , temporary support has emerged near the lower trendline at $94,164, aligning with key moving averages. Indicators suggest a potential short-term bounce; however, the overall sentiment remains more bearish than not. Bearish indicators weigh on price action Recent data from TradingView reflects Bitcoin’s ongoing struggle, with BTC/USD still down $13,000 from last week’s all-time highs. According to trader and analyst Rekt Capital, BTC has made a Bearish Engulfing candlestick formation on the weekly chart. This development, coupled with the loss of critical weekly support levels, signals the end of a five-week uptrend. #BTC The Weekly support has been lost (blue) The 5-week technical uptrend is over (orange) Bitcoin is showing increasing signs of transitioning into a multi-week correction Any relief rally, if at all needed, into these old supports could turn them into new resistance to… https://t.co/ZpfhWCtdt6 pic.twitter.com/U7d2zGOnpf — Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) December 23, 2024 Rekt Capital further warned of Bitcoin’s potential transition into a multi-week correction phase. Any relief rally may face resistance at previously lost support levels, reinforcing the likelihood of additional downside continuation. Indicators such as the RSI (14), currently at 42, show mild recovery but remain in bearish territory. Similarly, the Stochastic RSI’s bullish cross in the oversold region suggests short-term upward momentum, though the MACD’s bearish crossover persists, indicating weakening momentum. Bitcoin price movements: Source – TradingView Holiday trading periods often introduce heightened volatility due to reduced liquidity in the market. As liquidity profiles thin during these out-of-hours trading sessions, price movements can become exaggerated. Market commentator Mark Cullen identified two critical liquidity zones into 2025: $115,000 and sub-$80,000. He questioned which level would be tested first and suggested the potential for significant price swings to target both. A drop to $80,000 would align with historical bull market corrections. Glassnode’s data indicates that prior Bitcoin cycles experienced dips of 20% or more on the path to new all-time highs. Interestingly, the severity of #Bitcoin drawdowns during bull market uptrends has declined as the market grows. The deepest drawdown this cycle was -32% (Aug 5, 2024), with most corrections only -25% below local highs, reflecting spot ETF demand & rising institutional interest. pic.twitter.com/wpanco629S — glassnode (@glassnode) December 21, 2024 Despite the current cycle’s relative stability, the deepest drawdown of -32% in August 2024 echoes the crypto’s inherent volatility. Spot ETF demand and rising institutional interest have also tempered with price fluctuations, as the market seems to be sensitive to macroeconomic shifts. On-chain metrics: Network activity is less than previous highs Bitcoin’s active addresses, a key on-chain metric, reveal a divergence between price action and network activity. While the 100-day moving average of active addresses has rebounded, it has yet to reach its all-time high. This discrepancy suggests that a prolonged correction could occur if network activity declines further. Bitcoin Active Addresses – Source: TradingView Additionally, the Federal Reserve’s recent interest rate cut of 0.25% dampened risk-asset sentiment. Bitcoin, along with other cryptocurrencies, experienced renewed pressure as the prospect of additional rate cuts diminished. According to analysis from The Kobeissi Letter, BTC’s price is exhibiting a notable correlation with the global money supply (Global M2). Historically, Bitcoin prices have followed Global M2 with a lag of approximately 10 weeks. Over the past two months, Global M2 has dropped by $4.1 trillion, from a record $108.5 trillion in October to $104.4 trillion in December, the lowest level since August. This decline signals potential downward pressure on Bitcoin prices if the trend persists. The Kobeissi Letter highlighted the significance of this relationship, saying: “ As global money supply hit a new record of $108.5 trillion in October, Bitcoin prices reached an all-time high of $108,000. Over the last two months, however, money supply has dropped by $4.1 trillion. If the relationship still holds, this suggests that Bitcoin prices could fall as much as $20,000 over the next few weeks .” Despite macroeconomic headwinds, BTC’s growing illiquid supply offers a counterbalance. André Dragosch of Bitwise highlighted this trend, noting that a higher illiquid supply indicates increased scarcity, which could support Bitcoin’s price. While macro factors continue to exert downward pressure, on-chain tailwinds from Bitcoin’s supply deficit may mitigate the impact. Bitcoin vs Illiquidity Supply | BitMart Dragosch expects BTC to remain volatile in early 2025 but believes the scarcity dynamics driven by its illiquid supply could provide attractive buying opportunities for long-term investors.

38013767,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=106180,1734967679,How Key Ethereum Metrics Are Flashing Green Despite Price Correction,"The Ethereum market still witnesses several bullish metrics despite previous struggles and the latest ongoing pullback. Ethereum 's price struggles in recent years have been well documented, from underperforming Bitcoin and Solana in 2023 to failing to match their run to new all-time highs in 2024. Despite these struggles and a recent price correction, a CryptoQuant report suggests that key metrics continue to paint a bullish outlook for the altcoin.A Bullish Ethereum Storm Brewing?Over the past week, Ethereum's price has dropped about 19% from highs around the $4,100 price point to trade around $3,300 at the time of writing amid a market wipeout led by the Federal Reserve's hawkish pivot . Still, Ethereum's outlook remains significantly positive, at least according to a Monday, December 23 CryptoQuant report . Per the report, several key Ethereum metrics continue to paint a bullish picture of the asset. Estimated Leverage RatioOne such metric is the estimated leverage ratio. The ratio measures the balance of open interest in futures contracts on an exchange to its balance to determine the amount of leverage in a market. It can often help investors to gauge risk appetite.According to CryptoQuant's report, Ethereum's estimated leverage ratio remains near record highs at around 0.53, signifying a strong risk appetite among investors. Ethereum estimated leverage ratio chart: CryptoQuant Ethereum estimated leverage ratio chart: CryptoQuant The high-risk appetite amongst investors suggests they are not looking to reduce exposure to the asset.Funding RatesBeyond the estimated leverage ratio, the recent CryptoQuant report highlighted funding rates as another key Ethereum metric flashing green.Funding rates refer to a payment exchanged between perpetual contract holders designed to incentivize price stability by keeping the futures market price close to the spot price. Notably, funding rates are positive when the futures contract price is higher than the spot price, with long traders paying short traders. On the other hand, funding rates are negative when the contract price is lower than the spot price, with short positions paying longs.CryptoQuant highlighted that Ethereum's funding rate is moderately positive at 0.01, highlighting the potential for continued price growth with minimal liquidation risk. Ethereum funding rate chart. Source: CryptoQuant Ethereum funding rate chart. Source: CryptoQuant Positive funding rates signify bullish market sentiment as it suggests that long traders are willing to pay a premium to hold their contracts.Korea Premium IndexAnother metric signaling bullish Ethereum momentum, according to CryptoQuant, is the Korea Premium Index. The Korea Premium Index measures the difference between prices on Korean exchanges and other regions. It is often used as a yardstick to measure retail interest, as Korea is known for its large number of retail traders.Retail interest is believed to be high when this index is at a premium and low when it is at a discount. The CryptoQuant report highlights that Ethereum's Korea Premium Index is at a substantial premium, suggesting high retail interest. Ethereum Korea Premium Index chart. Source: CryptoQuant Ethereum Korea Premium Index chart. Source: CryptoQuant However, it is not only retail investors that appear interested in Ethereum at current prices.Ethereum Fund Holdings on the RiseThe final metric cited by CryptoQuant in its recent report is the balance of Ethereum on global funds, including spot Ethereum ETFs.The crypto analysis platform shared a chart indicating that this metric has been rising since November 2024 and has not plummeted despite the recent market dip. This suggests confidence in Ethereum's potential among institutional investors. Ethereum fund holdings chart. Source: CryptoQuant Ethereum fund holdings chart.

SOL remains down by half a percent in the past day, yet it has recovered by 5% since falling to one-month low of $175 on Friday. Its recent troubles means it’s still down by 16% in a week and by 28% in a month, although it holds on to a 92% increase in the past year, as part of a long-term upwards trajectory . And its bounce up from $175 suggests that it has already bottomed, and that it could enjoy a substantial recovery as we approach the end of 2024. Solana Rebounds From $175 Low – Could This Be the Launchpad to $300? While Solana still remains down on the medium-term timeframes, its indicators have begun showing signs of an incoming recovery. Its relative strength index (purple) has risen from a low 30 over the weekend to just over 50 today, signalling a return of buying pressure, as traders look to buy the dip. Source: TradingView It also seems as though SOL’s 30-period average (orange) has bottomed out and should begin climbing back towards its 200-day average (blue), a sign of a bullish reversal. As such, now does indeed look like a good time to buy Solana, which remains 30% down on the all-time high (of $263) it set at the end of November.

Looking at the tweet below, the popular Crypto Rover account seems to suggest that SOL could pass $900 by the second quarter of 2025. #Solana will explode. #Memecoin season will continue. pic.twitter.com/fKJhdHjeWH — Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) December 20, 2024 This may be optimistic, but it is entirely arguable that the current crypto bull market is only just getting started, what with Donald Trump’s second inauguration still ahead of it. A new Trump administration is likely to bring a much more favorable climate for crypto, with the President-elect already appointing the pro-crypto Paul Atkins as the person to replace the outgoing Gary Gensler as SEC Chairman. We may also see the belated arrival of comprehensive cryptocurrency legislation , which will further help nurture the cryptocurrency market in the US and elsewhere. This is why experts have predicted big things for Solana in 2025 , with the coin likely to pass $300 by the end of Q1. Diversification with New High-Return Alts Solana is likely to remain a strong performer for some time to come, but the ongoing bull market will also bring numerous other altcoins to the fore. This includes low-cap tokens and also presale coins, which can often surge when they list for the first time, especially if they’ve had a big sale. And one token having a big sale right now is Solaxy (SOLX) , which has already raised $4.5 million only a couple of weeks after opening its offering. $SOLX (SOLAXY) – World's First Solana L2!

While Solana has become more robust in recent months, dropped transactions and temporary outages have continued to affect the layer-one network during periods of peak traffic , so there’s clearly a demand for a reliable L2 solution. Within Solaxy’s ecosystem, SOLX will serve exclusively as payment for transactions fees, meaning that it could experience huge demand as the L2 grows. It will have a max supply of 138.046 billion SOLX, with 25% of this going to its sale and to community rewards. Investors can join its sale by going to its official website , where SOLX currently sells at $0.001576. Buyers should act quickly, since not only will this price rise in a day, but it will increase dozens of times before the sale ends. And once it does end, Solaxy’s early success could mean that its price explodes upon listing.

Daddy Pepe (DADDPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 11,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DADDPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Daddy Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Daddy Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Daddy Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Daddy Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Daddy Pepe by entering its contract address – 9UFnMabUe7wecdEEzAYPoQPZiuTJ1hTFpNz6qtsiB3FA – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DADDPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/daddy-pepe-daddpepe-solana-memecoin-will-surge-11000-ahead-of-exchange-listing-while-shib-wif-and-doge-underperform/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

38009534,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=375862,1734966827,Ethereum Key Metrics Point to Persistent Bullish Outlook for ETH: CryptoQuant,"Key metrics on Ethereum are painting a bullish outlook for the network’s native cryptocurrency, ether (ETH), despite its sluggish momentum over the past weeks. The asset has struggled to match bitcoin’s (BTC) momentum following the conclusion of the United States presidential election, but on-chain metrics indicate a bullish trend in the near term. According to an analysis by the pseudonymous CryptoQuant official EgyHash, factors like Ethereum’s funding rates and Estimated Leverage Ratio suggest traders are optimistic about ether’s profit potential. Ethereum Metrics Paint Bullish Outlook The Ethereum Estimated Leverage ratio indicates investors’ tendency to execute high-leveraged derivatives trades. The metric is currently at its peak, signaling a sustained risk appetite among ETH traders. Also, Ethereum funding rates are moderately positive, which indicates that long ETH positions are dominant but have not reached an extreme level. A moderately positive funding rate shows that there is still room for the price of ETH to increase without the risk of large-scale liquidations. EgyHash highlighted the Korea Premium Index for Ethereum, which has turned positive and is currently trading at a substantial premium. This index measures the price gap between South Korean crypto trading platforms and exchanges in other regions. The current state signals growing interest in Ethereum among Korean market participants, indicating positive market sentiment. ETH Investors Are Buying Furthermore, the CryptoQuant analyst mentioned that Ethereum fund holdings have been increasing steadily. This can be seen in the United States spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) market, which has recorded substantial inflows in seven out of the past nine trading days. Whales and large ETH investors have also been aggressively accumulating the asset, reaching an all-time high of 57% in supply ownership despite the recent market correction. EgyHash said this indicates continued confidence among institutional and retail ETH investors. “In aggregate, these factors point to a persistent bullish outlook for Ethereum, as market participants appear ready to maintain, and potentially increase, their exposure to the asset,” EgyHash added. Meanwhile, data from CoinMarketCap showed ETH trading at #3,344 at the time of writing, down 14% weekly and slightly up in the past 24 hours.

(TSXV: MATA) has announced a bold step to strengthen its corporate treasury by investing $4.5 million in Bitcoin. The Toronto Stock Exchange listed firm said it will transition the majority of its cash reserves from Canadian dollars (CAD) to U.S. dollars (USD). This decision, approved unanimously by the Board of Directors, is part of the company’s long-term strategy to mitigate risks associated with currency devaluation. National Debt Could Impact Purchasing Power of Canadian Dollar The Board shared concerns about Canada’s reliance on oil exports and its increasing national debt, which could erode the purchasing power of CAD-denominated assets. To counter these risks, the company is diversifying its treasury with Bitcoin and USD, both of which are viewed as more resilient stores of value. The Bitcoin allocation will take place in December 2024, with future acquisitions under consideration through measured buying programs. “Matador’s Board and management believe in using Bitcoin to future-proof our treasury,” said Sunny Ray, President of Matador. “This step also supports our mission to explore using Bitcoin as a platform for our gold-based products.” Growing Trend This latest move by Matador with a growing global trend of corporations adding Bitcoin into their treasuries as a hedge against inflation and currency debasement. MicroStrategy continues to focus more on its aggressive Bitcoin buying strategy. MicroStrategy executive chairman Michael Saylor continues to make huge investments in Bitcoin reflecting the firm’s commitment to leveraging crypto as a key component of its financial strategy. In a Monday post on X , MicroStrategy co-founder Michael Saylor said that the latest purchase brings the company’s total holdings to an impressive 444,262 BTC, accumulated at an average cost of $62,257 per Bitcoin.

Sonic built its SonicX game natively inside TikTok, attempting to replicate the success of mini apps that were built on theTON blockchain inside messaging platform Telegram.

38009733,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=632334,1734966635,DeSci tokens get a volume boost after Binance Launchpool adds Bio Protocol (BIO),"Binance has added to the emerging DeSci hype after it added one of the sector’s projects to its launchpool. As a result, trading volumes for DeSci tokens have grown by more than 31%. Binance made another statement about its DeSci focus by adding Bio Protocol (BIO) to Binance Launchpool. The DeSci project is the 63rd selection for the launchpool, allowing users to mine rewards after depositing BNB and FDUSD. Binance Launchpool remains a tool for passive income, in addition to signaling Binance’s interest in coins and tokens. $BIO is listing on Binance January 3rd! Let liquid science flow Bringing DeSci to 100m+ users on the most liquid crypto venue on the planet https://t.co/JxRYGAt9pm pic.twitter.com/KxXKVpd2S5 — BIO Protocol (@bioprotocol) December 23, 2024 Binance will start trading BIO on January 3, 2025. Before that, the exchange will have a 10-day farming period, starting from December 24. BIO farmers will have to lock up their BNB and FDUSD to receive airdrops for the launchpool period. After that, BIO will begin trading with a ‘Seed’ tag for potentially higher risk. The pool will distribute 99.6M BIO or 3% of the total supply. To avoid unfair allocations to whales, Binance will also introduce hourly caps to BIO received. 85M BIO will be airdropped to stakers with BNB in their wallets, while the remaining 14.9% will go toward FDUSD holders. BIO tokens have a distribution that will favor early backers and investors. A community auction will distribute 20% of the BIO supply, with another 25% set aside for ecosystem incentives. Early investors will control 13.6% of the tokens. The total supply of 3.2B tokens will unlock over six years, with a one-year cliff unlock. Binance has expressed its interest in DeSci despite the sector’s relatively underdeveloped status. Binance’s former CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao and Ethereum’s Vitalik Buterin have expressed interest in DeSci events. Binance’s direct investment may boost Bio Protocol’s profile For now, the DeSci sector is the smallest selection of tokens, as most are still in the early experimental stage. The addition of BIO could give legitimacy to some of the more promising projects. BIO is an early-stage token and a rather unusual choice for Binance Launchpool. Usually, the farming hub lists more liquid assets with a longer track record. However, Binance made an exception for Bio Protocol as one of its own investments. On November 8, Binance Labs raised an undisclosed funding round for Bio Protocol, becoming its sole VC backer. Bio Protocol may be able to consolidate the drive to create DeSci tokens, where now Pump.fun is serving that role. Bio Protocol will offer a curated selection of DeSci projects with backing from BIO token holders. By backing the protocol, Binance may gain control of an emerging token space and a new narrative. DeSci sector sees trading volume growth DeSci tokens as a whole remain closer to memes than to real scientific or biological projects. The entire collection of DeSci tokens is valued at around $600M, at one point only getting close to $1B. Origin Trail (TRAC) remains the leading DeSci token, with a total cap of $341M. The two other more active tokens are Rifampicin (RIF) and Urolithin A (URO), which build up their market value based on demand for virtual experiments. The tokens proved resilient despite a recent hack on Pump.science . BIO is also a minor asset, with fewer than 1,500 holders , though the project has promised overly ambitious reach. Bio Protocol itself will tap the demand for creating new DeSci tokens, by supporting a launchpad for new DeSci DAO projects. Bio Protocol already hosts DAOs attempting to build longevity, mental health, and bioengineering products. The protocol estimates around $40M in tokenized value based on biotechnological ideas. To this moment, Bio Protocol has carried a total of eight DeSci projects through its platform. The hub also advertises platforms and serves as a marketing and fundraising tool. Bio Protocol may turn into one of the leading fee producers in the Ethereum ecosystem. The biggest issue with citizen science remains the potential quality of the projects and the ability to deliver results. The BIO token, once it achieves sufficient liquidity, will serve as a governance asset to approve the launch of new DAO and DeSci startups. Holders will also receive priority approval for investing in those startups.

Here Are the Details,"President-elect Donald Trump has announced the appointment of Stephen Miran, a former Treasury official and economist at Hudson Bay Capital Management, as the new chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA). Trump Appoints Crypto Advocate Stephen Miran as Chairman of Council of Economic Advisers The CEA plays a key role in advising the president on economic issues, analyzing trends and formulating policies to promote growth and stability. Miran, known for his pro-crypto stance, recently voiced his support for reforming U.S. cryptocurrency regulations to encourage innovation. He has also criticized Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell in the past for urging Congress to pass a stimulus bill in 2020, calling the move “politically and economically incorrect.” Miran’s appointment aligns with Trump’s broader vision to position the U.S. as a global leader in cryptocurrency. Miran’s expertise and advocacy could signal a shift toward more crypto-friendly policies under the new administration. The announcement follows other high-profile appointments by Trump aimed at strengthening the administration’s crypto focus: Paul Atkins, a crypto advocate and former SEC Commissioner, has been elected as the new chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Bo Hines, a former congressional candidate, will serve as the Executive Director of the Presidential Council of Advisors for Digital Assets and will collaborate with the incoming “Crypto Czar” David Sacks. Trump’s appointments reflect his determination to make the U.S. the “crypto capital of the planet.” He has also floated the idea of creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve, a concept that could have far-reaching implications for the global cryptocurrency market. Miran’s appointment, combined with other crypto-focused leadership picks, signals a potential policy shift toward embracing digital assets under Trump’s administration. The move is expected to generate both excitement and scrutiny as the US establishes its position in the rapidly evolving crypto world. *This is not investment advice.

Ethereum (ETH) whales are making waves, setting an audacious price target of $10,000 for ETH, but their attention is also shifting to emerging opportunities like Lightchain AI (LCAI) . Currently priced at just $0.003 during its presale , LCAI offers a staggering potential rally of 12,102%, making it one of the most promising investments in the market. What’s driving this dual focus on Ethereum and Lightchain AI? Let’s dive into the details. Ethereum’s $10k Target Whale Optimism in Action Ethereum has been a cornerstone of the crypto ecosystem, revolutionizing decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs with its smart contract capabilities. Whales are optimistic about ETH reaching $10,000, citing several key factors. The Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, which transitioned the network to proof-of-stake (PoS), has drastically reduced energy consumption, making Ethereum more sustainable and attractive to institutional investors. Additionally, Ethereum's expanding ecosystem, fueled by a growing number of decentralized applications (dApps), continues to solidify its dominance in the blockchain space. Institutional adoption is also on the rise, with major corporations and financial institutions increasingly integrating Ethereum into their operations, driving both demand and price growth. While Ethereum's journey to $10,000 is supported by strong fundamentals, whales are also looking to altcoins like Lightchain AI for potentially even higher returns. Why Whales Are Eyeing Lightchain AI (LCAI) Lightchain AI is quickly attracting attention from investors thanks to its innovative integration of AI with blockchain technology. Unlike Ethereum, which focuses primarily on smart contracts and DeFi, Lightchain AI (LCAI) is carving out a unique space in AI-powered applications. One of its standout features is the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), which enables developers to create AI-driven decentralized applications (dApps) with potential use cases in industries like healthcare, finance, and logistics. Another groundbreaking feature is its Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism, which rewards nodes for AI computations, combining real-world utility with energy efficiency. Additionally, LCAI employs deflationary tokenomics, where a portion of transaction fees is burned, creating scarcity and driving up the token's value over time. These innovative attributes position Lightchain AI as a disruptive force in the crypto market, with many investors recognizing its potential to transform multiple industries. Ethereum vs. Lightchain AI: A Comparison While Ethereum remains the go-to platform for DeFi and NFTs, Lightchain AI offers a distinct value proposition through its focus on AI integration. Feature Ethereum (ETH) Lightchain AI (LCAI) Primary Focus Smart contracts, DeFi AI-powered blockchain Consensus Mechanism Proof of Stake (PoS) Proof of Intelligence (PoI) Ecosystem Growth Established Emerging but innovative Price Potential $10,000 by 2025 $0.003 to $15 (12,102% ROI) While Ethereum offers stability and long-term growth, Lightchain AI provides a higher risk-reward ratio, making it an attractive option for aggressive investors. Why Lightchain AI Could Outpace Ethereum’s Gains Ethereum’s $10k target represents a significant milestone, but its growth rate is expected to slow as the network matures. Lightchain AI, on the other hand, is in its early stages, offering exponential growth potential. Growth Drivers for Lightchain AI: Early-Stage Advantage: With its presale price at just $0.003, LCAI offers ground-floor entry for investors. Massive Market Opportunity: The convergence of AI and blockchain is a nascent field with immense potential, and LCAI is leading the charge. Community and Adoption: A rapidly growing community and strategic partnerships are accelerating LCAI’s adoption. Upcoming Catalysts: As Lightchain AI launches its mainnet and rolls out new features, investor interest is expected to surge.

38013765,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=106192,1734966410,"Analyst Says XRP New Cheap Entry Price Is $2, Expects $3 and $5 Sooner Than Anticipated","Market commentator BarriC shares an optimistic forecast for XRP, stating that market participants will soon view $2 as the new ""cheap entry point"" for the cryptocurrency. BarriC expressed this sentiment in a tweet, highlighting bold price predictions and various timelines for when these outlooks could materialize.$3 XRP: Coming Sooner Than ExpectedFirst, the analyst shared that XRP could reach the $3 mark much quicker than most analysts anticipate. The $3 level has been a major barrier for XRP for some time. It attempted to break this level earlier this month but stumbled at $2.90. Since then, it has retraced to the $1.90 level twice.Currently, XRP is trading at $2.18, and reaching $3 would only require a 38% surge. As a result, commentators like BarriC believe the target is within reach.$5 XRP by Early 2025Meanwhile, BarriC predicts that XRP will hit the $5 mark by early 2025. This prediction suggests a continued upward trend in the price of digital assets, drawing more attention from retail and institutional investors, as seen in November. Notably, attaining $5 would require a 130% increase from current levels.Interestingly, BarriC suggested that while market participants might expect a retracement when XRP reaches $5 , he believes the asset will rally to $10 without a correction. A similar scenario unfolded last month when XRP first surpassed $1 for the first time in three years.While many expected a pullback below $1, XRP went on to hit $2 without a major correction. It even maintained momentum and approached $3 as FOMO kicked in. BarriC expects a similar scenario to unfold again.$2 XRP: A ""Cheap"" Entry Point in RetrospectIn the scenario where XRP is finally trading in the double-digit range, BarriC suggests that market participants will look back and realize that $2 XRP was a ""cheap"" entry point into the market.In his view, those waiting for XRP to dip further may regret not taking advantage of current levels once the price rises. According to BarriC, by the end of 2025, when XRP could be trading in the $15-$20 range, looking back at $2 will feel like a missed opportunity.While he predicts bold price levels in the $15-$20 range by 2025, he also acknowledges that XRP could exceed those levels in the heat of the bull market next year.With the year coming to a close, BarriC indicates that explosive price movement for XRP could begin in the next three weeks.",POSITIVE,XRP,BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/23/analyst-says-xrp-new-cheap-entry-price-is-2-expects-3-and-5-sooner-than-anticipated/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=analyst-says-xrp-new-cheap-entry-price-is-2-expects-3-and-5-sooner-than-anticipated,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Currently priced at just $0.003 during its presale, LCAI presents a compelling alternative, combining innovative artificial intelligence with decentralized technology. With increasing interest from the crypto community, including experienced DOGE and SHIB investors, let’s examine why Lightchain AI is positioning itself as a promising token for those aiming for substantial growth. Why Dogecoin and Shiba Inu Traders Are Turning to Lightchain AI Investors in DOGE and SHIB are increasingly drawn to Lightchain AI (LCAI) for its clear focus on utility and innovation, offering a compelling contrast to the meme-driven narratives of traditional memecoins. Unlike these coins, which rely heavily on hype and community momentum, LCAI integrates artificial intelligence into its blockchain, creating a unique value proposition that appeals to tech-savvy traders looking for real-world utility. Additionally, the presale price of $0.003 is catching the attention of those who remember the meteoric rises of DOGE and SHIB from similarly low entry points, suggesting that LCAI could follow a similar growth trajectory as adoption increases. The Game-Changing AI Tools Behind Lightchain AI At the heart of Lightchain AI’s success are its advanced AI tools, which are setting a new standard for blockchain innovation. Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM)The AIVM allows developers to deploy decentralized AI applications (dApps) seamlessly. From predictive modeling to AI-driven logistics solutions, the AIVM offers practical applications across industries, making LCAI more than just another altcoin. Proof of Intelligence (PoI)LCAI’s PoI consensus mechanism rewards nodes for executing AI computations, such as training machine learning models. This approach not only increases network efficiency but also ensures energy sustainability—an essential factor for long-term scalability. How LCAI Stands Out from DOGE and SHIB While Dogecoin and Shiba Inu paved the way for community-driven cryptocurrencies, Lightchain AI is emerging as a tech-centric token with real-world applications that go beyond hype and memes. DOGE Known for popularizing cryptocurrency through its meme culture and ease of transactions, Dogecoin has gained widespread recognition. However, it lacks significant technological innovation, which limits its potential beyond a transactional token. SHIB Shiba Inu expanded its platform with features like ShibaSwap for decentralized finance (DeFi) and ambitious initiatives such as a metaverse project. Yet, much of its momentum still relies heavily on community enthusiasm rather than groundbreaking tech. LCAI Lightchain AI sets itself apart by seamlessly integrating blockchain technology with artificial intelligence. It offers innovative tools like the AI Virtual Machine (AIVM) for smarter contract execution and Proof of Intelligence (PoI) for enhanced consensus mechanisms. These features allow the platform to solve real-world problems, providing long-term utility that appeals to both traders and developers. With its technological edge and focus on practical applications, Lightchain AI is positioning itself as a superior option for those seeking a forward-thinking and sustainable investment in the crypto space. Investor Momentum and Market Impact The Lightchain AI (LCAI) presale is making waves, attracting millions in funding and a growing number of DOGE and SHIB holders. Its success stems from transparent tokenomics, deflationary mechanisms, and a focus on scalability, making it a standout opportunity for investors. Analysts predict a staggering 12,000% rise by 2025, presenting LCAI as a rare ground-floor chance to tap into a booming market trend. Lightchain AI’s applications span from decentralized finance (DeFi) to AI-driven healthcare solutions, positioning it to disrupt industries and increase demand for its token. With its innovative approach and extensive use cases, LCAI offers a promising opportunity for those looking to invest in the future of AI and blockchain.

POL: Polygon's Native Cryptocurrency Enhancing Ethereum's Scalability POL is the native cryptocurrency of Polygon, a layer two scaling solution for Ethereum. Polygon enables fast transactions and lower fees, operating alongside Ethereum to let users bridge assets and access many applications at reduced costs. POL is used for network fees, staking, and governance. The platform uses a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. Validators secure the network and process transactions, while delegators can stake their POL through trusted validators. Polygon's efficiency and low fees enhance Ethereum's scalability and accessibility. In the current market cycle, POL's potential in supporting DeFi protocols makes it an attractive option. TRON (TRX): Empowering Content Creators with Blockchain Technology TRON (TRX) is a decentralized blockchain platform launched by the Tron Foundation in 2017. It aims to give digital content creators full ownership rights and more rewards by enabling direct transactions between creators and consumers, eliminating intermediaries like YouTube and Apple. TRON supports smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps), allowing developers to build and share content without transaction fees. Originally an ERC-20 token on Ethereum, TRX moved to its own network in 2018. With its focus on creating a decentralized Internet and acting as an alternative to Ethereum, TRON has potential in the blockchain space. In the current market cycle, its appeal depends on adoption and technological advances in decentralized content platforms. Cardano (ADA): A Scalable and Sustainable Blockchain Platform Cardano is a blockchain platform built for smart contracts, enabling decentralized finance apps, crypto tokens, and games. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, lets users store value, make payments, and stake on the network. Cardano stands out for its energy-efficient proof-of-stake mechanism, Ouroboros, which is more sustainable than traditional proof-of-work models. The blockchain is divided into two layers: the Settlement Layer for transactions and the Computing Layer for smart contracts. This design enhances its transaction processing capability, potentially up to a million transactions per second. With its focus on scalability and sustainability, ADA shows strong potential. In the current market cycle, the coin appears attractive due to its innovative technology. Terra Classic (LUNC): A Blockchain for Stable Global Payments Terra Classic (LUNC) is a blockchain protocol that uses fiat-pegged stablecoins to power global payment systems with stable prices. It combines the stability of traditional currencies with the censorship resistance of Bitcoin, aiming to offer fast and affordable settlements. Development began in January 2018, and the mainnet launched in April 2019. In May 2022, the original Terra chain was rebranded as Terra Classic after significant changes. The native token, originally known as LUNA, became LUNA Classic (LUNC). The protocol provides stablecoins pegged to currencies like the U.S. dollar and South Korean won. The technology has potential for efficient global transactions. The attractiveness of LUNC in the current market cycle depends on various market factors. Conclusion POL, TRX, ADA, and LUNC may have less short-term potential. DOGEN, designed for those seeking luxury and success, stands out. Expected 700% growth by presale's end and potential thousand-fold returns, DOGEN follows successful tokens like BONK, WIF, and Popcat. Early adopters receive exclusive perks in a community of alpha leaders aiming to dominate the market.

Polkadot: A Protocol for Blockchain Interconnection Polkadot is a decentralized protocol and cryptocurrency enabling different blockchains, like Ethereum and Bitcoin, to share data and value directly. It uses parachains to improve speed and scalability, processing transactions faster than Bitcoin and Ethereum. The native token, DOT, allows holders to vote on network upgrades and stake for transaction validation. Developed by Gavin Wood and launched on May 26, 2020, Polkadot presents a system for creating interoperable and efficient blockchains. Its potential lies in connecting previously isolated networks, making it attractive for developers and businesses looking to build scalable solutions. The coin’s appeal in the market depends on how interoperability and scalability needs evolve. Dogecoin: From Meme to Market Mainstay Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency launched in 2013 as a lighthearted alternative to Bitcoin. It features a Shiba Inu meme as its logo and was created to be abundant, with no cap on supply and 10,000 new coins mined every minute. Originally intended as a joke by developers Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, it became popular due to community support and social media influence. In 2021, its value surged, entering the top ten cryptocurrencies by market cap. Its potential lies in its widespread appeal and a strong, engaged community. In the current market cycle, its attractiveness depends on trends in social influence, adoption rates, and how it aligns with broader cryptocurrency developments. Conclusion DOT and DOGE have less short-term potential. DOGEN, designed for those seeking luxury and success, is expected to grow 700% by presale’s end, with potential for thousand-fold returns in this altcoin season. Following tokens like BONK, WIF, and Popcat, DOGEN aims for record-breaking success. It builds a community of leaders, offering real benefits to early adopters.

38011360,https://invezz.com/?p=2401220,1734966000,Crypto fear & greed index tumbles to lowest since Trump’s election win,"The crypto market has entered a more cautious phase, as the Fear and Greed Index—used to gauge market sentiment—dropped to 70 on Monday. This decline marks the lowest level since Donald Trump’s presidential victory last month. The index, which ranges from 0 (extreme fear) to 100 (extreme greed), serves as a barometer for market emotions, guiding investors on potential buying or selling opportunities. While still reflecting greed-driven confidence, the dip signals a growing awareness of risks as the market transitions away from its recent euphoric highs. Post-Trump high sentiment cools as Bitcoin slips Following Trump’s election victory, the index surged to 94, reflecting peak market greed as investors drove Bitcoin toward its December highs. However, the subsequent drop to 70 indicates a more measured approach among traders. At 94, the market is often seen as overvalued, with unchecked optimism driving asset prices. By contrast, 70 suggests caution is creeping in, with investors reassessing the potential for corrections or bubbles. Bitcoin’s price trajectory mirrors this shift in sentiment. Currently trading at approximately $95,488, the leading cryptocurrency has declined by over 8% in the past week. This slide underscores how the Fear and Greed Index often correlates with Bitcoin’s performance—prices tend to spike when greed dominates but can retreat sharply as fear sets in. The latest decline also highlights a subtle recalibration among investors. While greed remains a dominant theme, market participants appear to be heeding warnings about overvaluation, suggesting a more balanced outlook compared to the fervour seen earlier. Bitcoin’s holiday volatility remains unpredictable As the year-end approaches, the question of Bitcoin’s holiday performance has come under scrutiny. Historical trends offer little clarity, with the cryptocurrency displaying mixed behaviour during previous festive periods. Some years have witnessed price surges in January, while others have seen declines. One factor often cited is lower liquidity during the holidays, which can amplify price swings. Yet, the absence of significant institutional involvement during these periods has, at times, contributed to price stability. This year, external influences such as macroeconomic trends, Trump’s impending return to the White House, and the aftermath of 2024’s ETF approvals could dictate Bitcoin’s trajectory. Bitcoin’s notorious volatility, a hallmark of its market dynamics, remains a central theme. However, with the Fear and Greed Index now signalling a shift in sentiment, the holiday season may offer a quieter phase unless unexpected news reignites market activity.

38009769,https://coinedition.com/?p=564837,1734966000,South Korea Crypto Regulation: New Bill Targets Money Laundering,"South Korea is about to amend its Foreign Exchange Transactions Act. The proposed amendment involves more oversight of crypto transactions. Suspicious transactions increased by 48.8% in South Korea last year. The South Korean government wants to amend its Foreign Exchange Transactions Act. The amendment would require virtual assets service providers (VASPs) involved in cross-border transactions to register under the new Act and submit monthly reports of individual users’ transaction details to the Bank of Korea. According to reports, Choi Eun-Seok, a member of the National Assembly from the People Power Party (PPP), sponsored the amendment bill, citing the need to combat crypto-related money laundering and foreign exchange crimes in the country. Choi’s proposal centers on creating a system to monitor crypto transactions. Meanwhile, the lawmaker believes the rise of illegal transactions and money laundering in South Korea stems from the lack of monitoring.

38011359,https://invezz.com/?p=2401227,1734965700,Presidential pardon for Sam Bankman-Fried: truth or political controversy?,"The collapse of FTX in November 2022 marked one of the most high-profile failures in cryptocurrency history. Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), the founder of the exchange, was convicted on seven charges, including fraud, after a trial that concluded in November 2023. Sentenced to 25 years in prison , SBF has remained a divisive figure, not least due to his significant donations to the Democratic Party. With speculation mounting over a potential presidential pardon, this case continues to capture attention. Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk’s recent comments have only fuelled the debate over whether SBF’s political connections might help him secure leniency. SBF’s conviction SBF’s trial ended with a guilty verdict on all seven charges, including wire fraud and conspiracy to commit securities fraud, following the implosion of FTX. Prosecutors sought a sentence of 40 to 50 years, though the court settled on 25 years. The punishment marked a steep fall for a figure once hailed as a crypto innovator. His legal team argued for a more lenient sentence of six years, citing mitigating factors, but the court dismissed these pleas. The fallout from FTX’s bankruptcy, which affected millions of investors, continues to unfold. Bankruptcy proceedings are set to begin in January 2025, likely bringing further scrutiny to SBF’s role in the exchange’s operations. Some observers argue that resolving the legal quagmire surrounding FTX might be easier if SBF is granted a pardon. Proponents of this view suggest it could pave the way for a faster settlement for creditors and other affected parties. Political connections and their role in the pardon debate SBF’s donations to the Democratic Party have raised questions about his potential influence within political circles. Before FTX’s collapse, SBF was among the party’s largest donors, contributing millions during election cycles. Critics argue these financial ties might shield him from harsher consequences or even help him secure a presidential pardon. Elon Musk added his voice to the growing speculation, stating on X (formerly Twitter) that he would be “shocked” if a pardon didn’t happen. Musk’s remarks reignited debates about whether SBF’s political affiliations could affect the legal outcome. Elon Musk @elonmusk · Follow Replying to @WallStreetMav I will be shocked if this doesn’t happen 12:43 PM · Dec 23, 2024 0 Reply Copy link Read more on Twitter The Biden administration has faced scrutiny for pardons in other high-profile cases, such as those involving Hunter Biden. This precedent, some believe, lends credibility to the notion that SBF could also benefit from executive clemency. Charges dropped and implications for future trials Adding complexity to the case, six charges against SBF were dropped earlier this year. The dismissed charges spared him from a second trial that could have further compounded his legal woes. While this decision was procedural—stemming from limitations on extradition agreements with the Bahamas—it has nonetheless influenced public perception. For opponents of a pardon, the dismissal of these charges highlights concerns about potential leniency. For supporters, it underscores the idea that SBF has already faced significant legal repercussions. The ongoing bankruptcy proceedings may also shape the narrative, as creditors and investors seek restitution for their losses. Significance of a potential pardon A presidential pardon for SBF would set a significant precedent, not just for the cryptocurrency industry but for corporate accountability more broadly. It could raise questions about fairness in the judicial system, particularly if political connections are seen as a pathway to reduced consequences. On the other hand, supporters of a pardon argue that it could bring closure to a case that has loomed large over the crypto sector and restore some stability to the industry. As the FTX bankruptcy case progresses, the debate over SBF’s future is unlikely to subside. Whether or not a presidential pardon materialises, the fallout from this scandal will shape discussions around crypto regulation, political influence, and corporate governance for years to come.

Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, lets users store value, make payments, and stake on the network. Cardano stands out for its energy-efficient proof-of-stake mechanism, Ouroboros, which is more sustainable than traditional proof-of-work models. The blockchain is divided into two layers: the Settlement Layer for transactions and the Computing Layer for smart contracts. This design enhances its transaction processing capability, potentially up to a million transactions per second. With its focus on scalability and sustainability, ADA shows strong potential. In the current market cycle, the coin appears attractive due to its innovative technology. Avalanche (AVAX): A Fast, Eco-Friendly Blockchain with Customizable Subnets Avalanche is a Layer-1 blockchain offering low fees and quick transactions, processing up to 4,500 transactions per second. It allows users to launch custom Subnets, providing flexibility. Using a hybrid consensus mechanism that blends classical and Nakamoto methods, Avalanche achieves transaction finality in under 2 seconds. The platform includes three chains: X-Chain, C-Chain, and P-Chain, each serving different functions like transactions and smart contracts. AVAX, the native token, is essential for transaction fees, staking, and operating Subnets. With its speed, scalability, and utility, AVAX has strong potential. In the current market cycle, it appears attractive due to these features. Conclusion While ADA and AVAX have less short-term potential, DOGEN appeals to those seeking the best, embodying luxury and success. Inspired by tokens like BONK and Popcat, DOGEN aims for remarkable growth this altcoin season. Building a community of leaders, it offers real benefits and exclusive perks for early adopters.

38009816,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52947,1734965521,"Elon Musk’s Grok Says XRP Will Trade At This Price On January 1, 2025","Elon Musk’s AI tool, Grok, has entered the cryptocurrency conversation with a prediction about XRP’s possible price on January 1, 2025. Known for its analytical capabilities, Grok approaches the volatile crypto market with caution, admitting the challenges of making precise forecasts. Here’s what Grok had to say: “Predicting the exact price of XRP for January 1, 2025, involves a lot of speculation due to the inherent volatility of cryptocurrency markets. However, forecasts based on current trends suggest XRP could see a trading range influenced by various market dynamics, regulatory updates, and broader adoption.” Grok’s Price Prediction: Insights and Supporting Data While Grok avoids pinpointing a specific number, it aligns with current market analyses to outline a plausible range. For instance: Changelly’s Forecast: By January 2025, XRP’s price is expected to fluctuate between a minimum of $1.60 and a maximum of $1.96, with an average trading price of around $1.78. CoinCodex’s Projection: They predict a potential decrease of 20.17% from its current price, placing XRP near $1.83 by mid-January 2025. These projections suggest a relatively stable price trajectory for XRP, but Grok cautions that the cryptocurrency market is unpredictable. “Market sentiment, regulatory clarity, and adoption rates will be key factors shaping XRP’s price in the coming months,” Grok noted. The Regulatory Wild Card One of the most significant factors influencing XRP’s future is regulatory clarity. XRP has been under the spotlight due to Ripple’s prolonged legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). While Ripple secured a partial victory last year, the case remains unresolved, making uncertainty linger in the market. Grok highlights this as a crucial variable, stating, “If regulatory clarity improves or Ripple secures a definitive win, XRP’s price could exceed current forecasts. Conversely, unfavorable outcomes could suppress investor confidence.” This regulatory uncertainty has made XRP a unique asset, with its price often reacting to news developments rather than typical market trends. Adoption and Broader Market Dynamics Beyond regulation, XRP’s adoption in the financial sector could help shape its price. As a digital asset designed for efficient cross-border payments, XRP’s utility depends on whether financial institutions continue to adopt Ripple’s technology. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Grok also points to the interconnectedness of cryptocurrency markets: “XRP’s price is influenced by the broader market, including Bitcoin and Ethereum. Significant movements in leading cryptocurrencies often have a ripple effect across the ecosystem.” Global macroeconomic factors, such as inflation, interest rates, and geopolitical stability, will further impact XRP and other digital assets. A Word of Caution While Grok’s insights align with reputable market analyses, it urges investors to approach cryptocurrency predictions with caution. The AI chatbot wrote, “Cryptocurrency markets are inherently unpredictable, and no forecast is guaranteed. Investors should conduct thorough research, diversify their portfolios, and remain prepared for volatility.” As the countdown to 2025 continues, XRP awaits regulatory resolutions, market trends, and adoption rates. Grok’s balanced perspective reminds users of the complex crypto investment, urging participants to focus on the bigger picture while staying informed.

38009327,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=632318,1734965518,Elon Musk’s xAI is testing out a standalone iOS app for Grok,"Grok was only available to all X users up until recently. Now, Musk and the company are planning to make it publicly accessible as a separate app on iOS. This is positioning xAI to compete with OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini. The app can receive real-time data from the web and X and is now live in Australia and a few other countries in beta. It has generative AI features like rewriting text, summarizing long paragraphs, and a little Q&A, and it can also make images from text prompts. BREAKING Grok will have a stand alone app. pic.twitter.com/eYI6TIGbmr — Tesla Owners Silicon Valley (@teslaownersSV) December 23, 2024 xAI is also working on a website called Grok.com that will let people use the chatbot on the web. When you log in with an xAI account right now, the page says “coming soon.” Other AI chatbots have standalone apps; Grok doesn’t Unlike competitors like OpenAI that already have standalone apps for Android and iOS, Grok is exclusively available on X (previously Twitter). Grok’s integration with X gives it an edge in pulling real-time data directly from a widely used social platform. In addition, Grok is promoted by xAI as a versatile AI assistant with fewer restrictions than competitors. The company highlighted that Grok’s image-generator model excels at “photorealistic rendering” and doesn’t apply major limitations on its image-generation capabilities. This allows users to create images using pictures of public figures and copyrighted material. Upload images to Grok. You will be amazed at what it can figure out! And it gets better every week. https://t.co/FCl0xsN7hq — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 22, 2024 The goal is to attract users looking for greater capabilities. To make it more accessible, the company started testing a free version of the chatbot and rolled it out to all X users earlier this month. In addition, the new platform lets users access real-time data from the internet and X, as well as generative AI capabilities like rewriting text and summarizing long paragraphs. Grok’s listing describes the app as “an AI-powered assistant designed to be maximally truthful, useful, and curious.” Musk’s AI product has become incredibly competitive, according to Sam Altman, the co-founder of Open AI, who recently mentioned that Musk wants to have the biggest AI in the world as he spoke about their ongoing dispute. AI in 2025 with Musk in Trump’s administration The inauguration of a new administration in the United States will result in several policy and strategy changes regarding AI. Given Musk’s current central position in the AI world, it may be tempting to concentrate on the president-elect’s close relationship with Elon Musk in order to predict the direction of the AI winds under President Trump. Looking at Musk’s highly adversarial relationship with OpenAI, the next administration may take a less sympathetic approach to OpenAI when it engages the industry. Musk could have a hand in AI regulations and awarding government contracts. This is an actual risk that OpenAI is concerned about today. On the other hand, the Trump administration may selectively benefit Musk’s own enterprises, such as reducing red tape to allow xAI to build data centers and gain a competitive advantage in the frontier model race. It could also help Tesla with speedy regulatory approval to deploy its robotaxi fleet. More importantly, Elon Musk, unlike many other technology CEOs with Trump’s ear, takes existential AI safety threats very seriously and hence advocates for extensive AI regulation. For example, he backed California’s contentious SB 1047 bill, which aimed to impose significant restrictions on AI developers. Therefore, Musk’s influence could lead to a stricter regulatory environment for AI in the United States. However, Donald Trump and Elon Musk are both unpredictable and complex individuals. The mutual benefits of their newfound companionship have been evident thus far, however, it is currently in its honeymoon phase. Predictions indicate that the relationship will have deteriorated prior to the conclusion of 2025. What implications will this have for the field of AI?

Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum (ETH) has experienced notable price shifts in recent times. Over the past week, its value dropped by 15.25%, marking a significant decline. In the last month, the price decreased by 2.48%, and over six months, it edged down by 2.16%. Currently, Ethereum trades within a range of $3648.43 to $4137.17, reflecting the volatility in the market. Technical indicators hint at possible future movements for Ethereum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 38.07, approaching oversold levels, suggesting a potential rebound. The Stochastic indicator stands at 21.50, also indicating an oversold condition. However, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) level is -21.52, showing bearish momentum. The price hovers near its 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages of $3331.27 and $3461.32, respectively. Ethereum's immediate resistance level is at $4318. If the price breaks above this point, it could aim for the second resistance at $4807, an increase of around 11%. On the downside, the nearest support is at $3340.38. A drop below this could lead to the second support level at $2851.64, a decrease of about 15%. Given the current indicators and support levels, Ethereum may be poised for a turnaround or further decline, making this a critical juncture for the asset. XRP (XRP) Over the past six months, XRP has seen a remarkable increase of 366.94%. This significant rise reflects strong interest and trading activity around the cryptocurrency. In the last month, XRP’s price climbed by 77.14%, showcasing a robust upward trend. However, the past week experienced a dip of 7.81%, indicating some short-term volatility. Currently, XRP is trading between $2.03 and $2.73. The nearest resistance level is at $3.02, a point that, if surpassed, could lead to testing the second resistance at $3.73. On the other hand, the nearest support lies at $1.61, with a secondary support at $0.9041. These levels are key indicators of potential price movement in either direction. Technical indicators present a mixed picture. The 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages are close, at $2.24 and $2.28 respectively, suggesting the market is consolidating. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 42.72, indicating that XRP is neither overbought nor oversold. The MACD level is slightly negative at -0.0059, which could point to a mild bearish sentiment. Monitoring these indicators can provide insight into XRP's potential price direction in the near future. Solana (SOL) SOL has faced notable price shifts recently. In the past week, its price dropped by 18.80%, and over the last month, it decreased by 30.50%. Despite these declines, Solana has grown by 34.97% over the past six months. The current trading range is between $205.85 and $239.87, showing significant volatility. Technical indicators suggest the bearish trend might persist. The RSI is at 38.29, nearing oversold levels. The MACD is negative at -1.376, and the Stochastic oscillator is low at 26.34. These figures point towards potential further declines, but they could also hint at an upcoming reversal if buyers step in. Solana's nearest support is at $188; falling below this could lead to a drop to the next support at $154. On the upside, resistance levels are at $256 and $290. To reach the first resistance, Solana needs to rise by about 8%. A decline to the nearest support means a decrease of around 10%. The 10-day SMA is $182.89, and the 100-day SMA is $193.52, indicating recent prices are above average. Conclusion ETH, XRP, SOL are promising, yet XYZVerse (XYZ) combines sports enthusiasm with meme culture, targeting significant growth and community-driven success in the current 2024 bull run.

42417015,faad5f9b-a3da-45d5-a040-842ceecabba6,1734965206,Investment Advisers to Supplant Hedge Funds as Top BTC ETF Holders in 2025: CF Benchmarks,"Investment advisers will probably overtake hedge funds as the biggest holders of  U.S.-listed spot bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) next year, CF Benchmarks said Monday.  A total of 11 spot BTC ETFs debuted in the U.S. on Jan. 11, providing a way for investors to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency without personally having to hold and store it. Since their inception, they have accumulated over $36 billion in investor funds.  Demand has been dominated by hedge-fund managers, who own 45.3% of the ETFs. Investment advisers, the gatekeepers to retail and high-net-worth capital, are a distant second at 28%.  That's set to change in 2025, according to CF Benchmarks, which predicts investment advisers' share will rise above 50% in both the BTC and ether (ETH) ETF markets. CF Benchmarks is a U.K.-regulated index provider behind several key digital asset benchmarks, including the BRRNY, referred by many ETFs.  ""We expect Investment advisor allocations to rise beyond 50% for both assets, as the $88 trillion U.S. wealth management industry begins to embrace these vehicles, eclipsing 2024's combined record-breaking $40 billion in net flows,"" CF Benchmarks' said in an annual report shared with CoinDesk.  ""This transformation, driven by growing client demand, deeper understanding of digital assets, and product maturation, will likely reshape the current ownership mix as these products become staples in model portfolios,"" the index provider said.  Investment advisers are already in pole position in the ether ETF market and are likely to extend their lead next year.   Ether's parent blockchain, Ethereum, is expected to benefit from the growing popularity of asset tokenization while rival Solana could continue to gain market share on potential regulatory clarity in the U.S.   ""We expect the trend towards asset tokenization to accelerate in 2025, with tokenized RWAs topping $30B,"" the report said, referring to real-world assets.   In stablecoins, new entrants like Ripple's RLUSD and Paxos' USDG are expected to challenge the dominance of tether's USDT, whose market share has increased from 50% to 70%.

They specialize in the Internet of Things (IoT), connecting devices like computers, cars, and phones. By combining IoT with blockchain technology, Jasmy creates a secure platform where users can safely store and exchange their data. In this system, your personal information becomes your own asset, and you have the power over it. In today's market, data privacy is more important than ever.

Pepe (PEPE) PEPE is a new player in the cryptocurrency world, born from the popular Pepe the Frog meme created by Matt Furie. Launched on the Ethereum blockchain, this deflationary memecoin has captured the attention of many. It follows in the footsteps of other meme-based cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. By embracing its meme origins and keeping things simple with a no-tax policy and being upfront about its lack of utility, PEPE appeals to those who enjoy the fun side of crypto. In late April and May of 2023, PEPE's value skyrocketed, reaching a market cap of $1.6 billion at its peak. Early investors saw huge gains, and a strong community formed around it. This surge sparked what some call a ""memecoin season,"" with new memecoins popping up and experiencing wild price swings. PEPE's roadmap includes plans for major exchange listings and aims for a ""meme takeover."" Whether PEPE will reach new heights remains uncertain, but with the upcoming Bitcoin halving and hopes for a Bull Run, many are watching closely.

Price predictions suggest FET could gain value in the coming years, reaching over $1 by 2025 and $1.19 by 2030. Compared to other AI-focused coins like SingularityNET or Ocean Protocol, Fetch.ai stands out with its autonomous agents and practical applications. As demand for AI solutions increases, Fetch.ai might be a project to watch in the evolving crypto landscape. Stellar Lumens (XLM) Stellar Lumens (XLM) is changing the way money moves around the globe. Founded in 2014, Stellar is a decentralized network that uses blockchain technology to make sending funds fast and affordable. It doesn't pick favorites among currencies. Instead, it allows people to transfer any type of money, whether it's a national currency or a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. Over the years, Stellar has processed billions of transactions and teamed up with major companies. With Stellar apps, individuals can send money worldwide, and businesses can build their own blockchain tools or use the network for payments and currency exchanges. Unlike many other cryptocurrencies that aim to replace traditional financial systems, Stellar wants to work with them. It offers a platform where different financial systems can collaborate. This approach sets it apart in the current market, where cooperation is becoming more important. The Stellar Development Foundation, supported initially by Stripe, helps promote the network's use. It works on projects like NFT creation and smart contracts. As the crypto market evolves, Stellar's focus on bridging old and new financial worlds might make it stand out among other coins. Its technology and partnerships could play a key role in the future of global finance. Conclusion During the 2024 bull run, altcoins like JASMY, PEPE, FET, and XLM show promise.

38009518,https://invezz.com/?p=2401222,1734964800,MicroStrategy joins Nasdaq 100 while Sol Strategies enters CSE 25 index,"On the same day, two prominent companies have gained recognition for their market performance and strategic initiatives. MicroStrategy, the business intelligence firm known for its substantial Bitcoin holdings, has entered the prestigious Nasdaq 100 index. Meanwhile, Sol Strategies, a key player in the blockchain ecosystem, has secured a spot in the Canadian Securities Exchange (CSE) 25 Index, marking a significant milestone in its growth trajectory. These developments underscore the rising influence of technology-driven firms in traditional and emerging financial markets, highlighting their ability to attract investor interest and institutional recognition. Sol Strategies gains CSE 25 recognition Sol Strategies (HODL.CN), a blockchain-focused investment firm, was officially added to the CSE 25 Index following the Canadian Securities Exchange’s quarterly rebalancing. The index, which tracks the top 25 companies by market capitalisation, made the announcement on Friday, with changes effective at the close of trading. The inclusion of Sol Strategies reflects its remarkable year-to-date performance, with its stock surging by an impressive 2,195%. The firm, which primarily acquires and stakes Solana (SOL) tokens, has established itself as a major player in the blockchain sector. Its holdings include $400 million worth of SOL tokens staked at a 9% annual yield, providing a steady income stream for shareholders. The rebalancing process also led to the addition of other companies, including Bright Minds Biosciences Inc. (DRUG) and Highlander Silver Corp. (HSLV), further diversifying the index. Funds tracking the CSE 25 are expected to purchase Sol Strategies stock to maintain exposure to the updated index, potentially driving additional demand. MicroStrategy’s Nasdaq 100 entry highlights Bitcoin strategy success MicroStrategy’s inclusion in the Nasdaq 100 signals a growing acceptance of cryptocurrency-focused strategies among mainstream financial institutions. The company, led by Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor, has amassed over 158,000 Bitcoin, positioning itself as a bellwether for corporate crypto investment. This achievement reflects not only MicroStrategy’s innovative approach but also the increasing intersection of traditional finance with digital assets. Its stock has gained significant traction this year, driven by bullish sentiment around Bitcoin’s recovery and the company’s ability to leverage its holdings for financial stability and growth. As part of the Nasdaq 100, MicroStrategy joins a cohort of high-performing tech firms, further solidifying its reputation as a leader in the digital transformation of financial markets. Growing investor interest in blockchain-focused firms The addition of Sol Strategies to the CSE 25 Index also signifies rising investor confidence in blockchain technology. The company’s consistent acquisition of Solana validators and its active investments in the blockchain ecosystem have contributed to its rapid growth. Chairman Antanas Guoga, popularly known as Tony G, has become a prominent figure, with his profile gaining significant attention on social media. This visibility, combined with the company’s strong performance, positions Sol Strategies for continued expansion. MicroStrategy’s rise to the Nasdaq 100 and Sol Strategies’ inclusion in the CSE 25 reflect broader trends in the financial landscape. Blockchain and cryptocurrency-focused companies are gaining institutional recognition, underscoring their potential to shape the future of finance.

The markets are heading towards the end of the yearly trade but the price of the second-largest token continues to juggle within a narrow range. While some of the indicators point towards a bearish close, others suggest a major upswing is fast approaching, and hence the pullback could be a great buying opportunity for the ETH price rally. In the times when Bitcoin price is struggling hard to reclaim the lost levels at $100K, Ethereum displays huge stability and a great potential to form new highs soon. As per the data from CryptoQuant, the balance on accumulation addresses witnessed a steep rise after the price displayed stability above $2000 by maintaining a range-bound trade above the range. The whales seem to be accumulating without much noise, suggesting an explosive breakout could be fast approaching. On the other hand, the active address of Ethereum has been consistently rising since the start of November, marking over 400K from the lows of around 250K. Besides, the balance on the exchanges that surged until the end of November began to drop in December, reducing the levels by over 700 million. This suggests that traders remain bullish on Ethereum and hence the start of 2025 could be explosive. The weekly chart of ETH price suggests after a long pullback, the token has been holding the support at $3346. A rise above this level could validate a rise above the bearish influence, as a drop below the range may trigger the lower target at $3000 or even lower to $2750. Besides holding the levels may long towards $3500 or even $4000. However, reclaiming $3400 is extremely important to keep up the bullish scenario for the Ethereum (ETH) price rally.",POSITIVE,ETH,ALTCOIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/despite-multiple-rejections-at-4000-heres-why-you-need-to-be-bullish-on-ethereum-eth-price-rally-in-2025/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png
38008584,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=632300,1734964574,MicroStrategy outperforms nearly every US stock with 480% yearly gain thanks to Bitcoin,"MicroStrategy (MSTR) is on a tear, blowing past nearly every other stock in the U.S. with a 480% surge this year, thanks to one relentless strategy: buying Bitcoin like there’s no tomorrow. The company has turned its balance sheet into a fortress of digital gold, and the results are clear. Today, it joins the Nasdaq 100, an epic comeback for a company that nearly faded into obscurity in the 2000s. MicroStrategy has also dropped $561 million to buy another 5,262 Bitcoins less than an hour ago, which tracks per its recent purchase pattern. Right now, its total holdings are 444,262 coins, worth around $43 billion. Screenshot of Michael Saylor posting about MicroStrategy’s latest Bitcoin purchase. Source: X (@saylor) Michael Saylor, the company’s founder and executive chairman, has transformed MicroStrategy into the ultimate Bitcoin play, catapulting its market cap from $1.1 billion in 2020 to $82 billion today. And it only took him four years. From dot-com crash to Bitcoin boom MicroStrategy started out as a software company specializing in business intelligence, riding the dot-com wave to a flashy Nasdaq debut in 1998. Saylor, then 33, stayed in a penthouse suite at the Lotte New York Palace in Manhattan on the eve of the IPO, courtesy of lead underwriter Merrill Lynch. The next morning, he watched as MicroStrategy’s stock popped 76% on its first day, with Nasdaq issuing a special ticker warning: “Please do not confuse MSTR with MSFT,” the latter being Microsoft. The good times didn’t last. The dot-com bust obliterated MicroStrategy’s value, and the company spent the next two decades clawing its way back with steady software revenue, generating around $100 million per quarter. But in 2020, Saylor decided to go all in on Bitcoin. He bet the company’s future on the apex crypto, calling it “the next technology wave.” Critics called him reckless. Saylor didn’t care. By mid-2020, MicroStrategy began borrowing money and issuing stock to fund the Bitcoin purchases. Today, it’s the fourth-largest Bitcoin holder in the world, behind only Bitcoin’s creator Satoshi Nakamoto, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust, and Binance. Not everyone is cheering though. Predictably, Peter Schiff, a proud Bitcoin hater, mocked Saylor’s strategy on X (formerly Twitter), writing, “Wash, rinse, repeat—what could possibly go wrong?” But for MicroStrategy, the numbers speak for themselves. This year’s surge follows a 346% gain in 2023. Trump, Bitcoin, and Wall Street’s crypto frenzy Donald Trump’s election victory poured gasoline on an already raging crypto fire. Backed by heavy funding from the crypto industry, Trump promised to make the U.S. the “crypto capital of the planet.” Since his win, Bitcoin has climbed 41%, BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF is up 39%, and MicroStrategy’s stock has jumped 60%, finally surpassing its dot-com-era high from 2000. In July, at the largest Bitcoin conference of the year in Nashville, Trump pledged to fire SEC Chair Gary Gensler, an outspoken crypto critic, and replace him with deregulation advocate Paul Atkins. Trump also named venture capitalist David Sacks as the White House A.I. and Crypto Czar, doubling down on his commitment to the industry. “Taxes are coming down,” Saylor said after Trump’s victory. “All the hostility from regulators to banks touching Bitcoin is gone.” In December, he pitched Microsoft shareholders on adopting Bitcoin, urging the tech giant to invest some of its $78.4 billion in cash and equivalents into the crypto. “Microsoft can’t afford to miss the next technology wave, and Bitcoin is that wave,” Saylor declared in a video presentation. The pitch didn’t land. Less than 1% of Microsoft shareholders supported the move. But for Saylor, the rejection was just another opportunity to preach Bitcoin’s merits. He has long been an evangelist for the OG crypto, co-authoring a book in 2022 titled What is Money? Critics of his style say his approach resembles a cult. ETFs, institutional access, and what’s next Until this year, MicroStrategy was one of the few ways institutions could gain exposure to Bitcoin. As an equity, it didn’t require special regulatory provisions, making it a convenient proxy for Bitcoin investments. That changed in January when the SEC approved spot Bitcoin ETFs, allowing investors to buy funds that directly track Bitcoin’s value. Despite the competition, MicroStrategy remains a favorite on Wall Street. Its stock is a pure Bitcoin play, and its performance has tracked the cryptocurrency’s rise almost perfectly. With Trump’s victory and a wave of deregulation on the horizon, Saylor believes the entire crypto market is set for explosive growth. “With the red sweep, Bitcoin is surging up with tailwinds, and the rest of the digital assets will also begin to surge,” he said .

38008424,https://finbold.com/?p=222126,1734964514,This crypto is down 42% and screams “buy” right now (Hint: Not XRP),"XRP has been one of the top performers in Q4 2024, increasing its market cap rank in an impressive rally. Meanwhile, other cryptocurrencies significantly retraced in a recent market crash that liquidated billions from long positions , creating a buying opportunity. In particular, MultiversX ( EGLD ) is down over 42% since a local top of $58.31, currently trading at $33.63. Technical indicators suggest EGLD could be a “buy” right now, with the potential to bounce back up from support . EGLD price analysis and technical indicators The key support zone formed after EGLD broke out on November 11, following weeks of consolidation. EGLD gathered momentum, crossing the 200-day exponential moving average (1D 200-EMA), which is now hovering around $34.91. Therefore, keeping the price action above the support zone, successfully tested during last week’s crash, and breaking out of the 200-EMA again could set MultiversX’s native token for another rally. Conversely, the daily Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) shows weak momentum at 36.00, which could indicate some more bearish continuation. Nevertheless, these RSI levels have historically preceded short-term reversals and breakouts as investors favored fundamentals and embraced the buying opportunity. MultiversX (EGLD) daily price chart. Source: TradingView / Finbold / Vini Barbosa MultiversX (EGLD) “buy” fundamentals despite a 42% price drop Despite the poor price action and the potential reversion hinted at by technical indicators, MultiversX’s “buy” is also backed by solid fundamentals, expert analyses, and real-world momentum with partnerships and collaborations. From a technology perspective, MultiversX is one of the most scalable, decentralized, and secure blockchains, capable of meeting high-level demand. Justin Bons, founder of Europe’s oldest cryptocurrency fund, called MvX the “technological Holy Grail of crypto” due to its properties. Last week, three other analysts mentioned they were “keeping an eye” on EGLD , as Finbold reported. Namely, Lucky Luciano , EliZ , and Crypto Busy , all with over a six-digit follower count on X. Lucky targets $100 for EGLD, which can also be read as “eGold,” saying it has “much room for growth ahead.” Active development, partnerships, and collaborations Notably, the MultiversX ecosystem is known for its focus on active development, especially through hackathons and collabathons happening worldwide. In 2024, for example, the Foundation hosted MultiversX Rust Bootcamp in Turkey, Helios Stacking hosted a collabathon with Injective ( INJ ) in Spain, and Rather Labs recently had its MultiversX development-focused event in Argentina. For 2025, MultiversX has partnered with Alibaba Cloud to host hackathons and related events in Asian countries, as Finbold reported. Moreover, the Foundation recently announced a $1.5 million grants program called Growth Games, and Beniamin Mincu is exploring a collaboration with Cardano’s ( ADA ) Charles Hoskinson.

38010080,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/tiktoks-first-app-layer-sonicx-will-airdrop-tokens-to-tiktok-users,1734964280,TikTok’s First App Layer SonicX Will Airdrop Tokens to TikTok Users,"Sonic SVM, the developer of TikTok App Layer SonicX, has unveiled an ambitious new initiative: an airdrop of $SONIC tokens for all TikTok users onboarded through its platform. The bold move aligns with Sonic’s mission to bridge TikTok’s immense user base with web3, with a $SONIC token airdrop regarded as the best way to accelerate this goal. A Sonic Boom Sonic’s vision of seamlessly merging web2 with web3 is already bearing fruit. Through its TikTok App Layer, SonicX has onboarded over 2 million users, leveraging the social media giant’s unparalleled reach and user engagement. Sonic’s goal of bringing 1 billion TikTok users into the web3 fold may seem audacious, but their innovative approach to onboarding and engagement shows they’re not afraid to think big. If it does achieve this goal, it will be thanks to two major components: seamless onboarding and a sharp distribution strategy. For most prospective users, the barriers to web3 lie in its complexity. Sonic eliminates these hurdles with a frictionless onboarding process powered by account abstraction. TikTok users can log in using their existing accounts, bypassing the need to set up and connect a separate web3 wallet. The user experience remains gasless, ensuring that transactions within the app are processed without requiring users to sign blockchain transactions. This approach creates an intuitive, web2-style experience while preserving the power and benefits of blockchain technology. The initial success of SonicX proves that blockchain adoption doesn’t have to entail a steep learning curve: it can feel as effortless as scrolling through TikTok. Targeted Growth Through TikTok Sonic’s unique position as a TikTok-focused web3 platform is bolstered by its team’s deep ties to the social media giant. Several Sonic team members, including CEO Chris Zhu, hail from ByteDance, TikTok’s parent company. Their insider knowledge of TikTok’s mechanics, distribution strategies, and ecosystem has been instrumental in driving SonicX’s growth. Using premium TikTok advertising, strategic partnerships with TikTok creators, and algorithm-driven targeting, Sonic has effectively captured its target audience. Campaigns designed to appeal to specific regions and demographics have seen users seamlessly onboard via ad and video links, while Sonic’s corporate TikTok account serves as a hub for gaming, blockchain education, and interactive events like live streams and branded challenges. When $SONIC? While the snapshot date for the $SONIC airdrop has not been announced, TikTok users still have time to qualify by accessing SonicX through the official Sonic SVM TikTok account. This campaign is part of a broader push leading up to Sonic’s Token Generation Event (TGE), which will reward eligible users with token allocations. Sonic’s bootstrapping strategy bears a passing resemblance to that of other pioneers in web3 retail onboarding, such as Telegram’s $TON ecosystem. With TikTok boasting over 1 billion monthly active users and projected to reach 2.35 billion by 2029, Sonic’s strategy could unlock a vast and untapped market for web3 gaming and applications. The numbers are already impressive: SonicX surpassed 1 million players within a month of its debut, demonstrating the platform’s viral appeal and potential for sustained growth. Sonic SVM isn’t stopping at a single game or airdrop either: its broader vision involves creating a TikTok Chain through its App Layer, allowing seamless integration for other projects seeking to tap into TikTok’s massive audience. The upcoming release of Mahjong 123, Sonic’s first game on SonicX.app , will mark the start of this expansion, with more content to follow.

Ondo (ONDO) Ondo Finance is changing the game by blending the stability of traditional finance with the innovation of blockchain technology. It takes reliable, income-generating assets like US Treasuries and tokenizes them, making them accessible to everyone through the blockchain. This means that everyday investors can now participate in high-grade financial products that were once hard to access. Ondo’s approach enhances financial infrastructure and broadens accessibility, aiming to democratize finance. In a market where trust and security are crucial, Ondo stands out by collaborating with trusted partners like BlackRock and using Coinbase for secure asset custody. Their commitment to transparency and regulatory compliance sets them apart. One of their notable products, USDY, offers the stability of a stablecoin with the added benefit of yield, backed by real assets like US Treasuries. For investors looking for quality and security in the volatile crypto market, Ondo Finance presents an attractive option. Its innovative blend of traditional assets and blockchain technology positions it well in the current market cycle, especially compared to other coins that lack such solid backing. Stacks (STX) Bitcoin is the biggest name in cryptocurrency, known for its security and value. But it lacks one thing: smart contracts. That’s where Stacks comes in. Stacks (STX) is a layer built on top of Bitcoin that allows smart contracts and decentralized apps to use Bitcoin’s network. It unlocks over $500 billion in Bitcoin capital for new possibilities. With its unique Proof of Transfer system and Clarity programming language, Stacks can read the entire Bitcoin state anytime. Plus, every Stacks transaction is settled on the Bitcoin blockchain, secured by its vast computing power. In today’s market, integrating smart contracts with Bitcoin is a big deal. While other platforms like Ethereum have smart contracts, they don’t have Bitcoin’s security and value. Stacks bridges that gap. As the crypto market looks for more secure and decentralized options, STX could stand out. Its strong technology and connection to Bitcoin make it an attractive option in the current cycle. Whether STX will soar remains to be seen, but it certainly brings something new to the table. Brett (BRETT) Meet Brett, Pepe’s best friend and the newest sensation on Base Chain.

Musk the Manipulator (MUSKMANI), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKMANI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk the Manipulator can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk the Manipulator could become the next viral memecoin. Musk the Manipulator launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk the Manipulator on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk the Manipulator by entering its contract address – DZpfk5LaLrnP6vSFJnLSMAopUuTJGiFk7543rQxh4ids – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKMANI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/solana-memecoin-musk-the-manipulator-muskmani-to-skyrocket-14000-before-exchange-listing/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum’s price has been fluctuating between $3648.43 and $4137.17, reflecting market volatility. Bears appear to have taken control, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 38.07 indicating weak momentum. Over the past week, the price has decreased by 15.25%, underscoring bearish pressure. However, the price is nearing the nearest support level at $3340.38, which may provide a foundation for a potential rebound. If Ethereum bounces back from the support level, it could aim for the nearest resistance at $4318. This would represent an increase of about 15% from the current price. Should buying pressure intensify, the second resistance level at $4807 becomes a target, suggesting a rise of approximately 32%. Currently, the 10-day Simple Moving Average at $3331.27 is below the 100-day SMA at $3461.32, reflecting bearish sentiment. However, the Stochastic indicator at 21.50 suggests the asset is nearing oversold territory, supporting the possibility of an upward movement. XRP (XRP) XRP is trading between $2.03 and $2.73, showing a period of consolidation. The price dipped by -7.81% over the past week, but it has surged by 77.14% in the last month, indicating strong upward momentum. The Relative Strength Index is at 42.72, suggesting the asset is nearing oversold territory, which might attract buyers. The Simple Moving Averages over 10 and 100 days are closely aligned, pointing to a potential trend development. If XRP breaks above the nearest resistance at $3.02, it could aim for the next level at $3.73. Achieving these levels would represent significant gains from current prices. With a six-month increase of 366.94%, XRP has shown substantial growth. Traders are watching these key levels, anticipating a possible rally as optimism builds for an upcoming altcoin season and a broader crypto market bull run. Solana (SOL) Solana (SOL) is currently trading within the range of $205.85 to $239.87. Over the past week, the price has decreased by 18.80%, and over the past month, it has dropped by 30.50%. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 38.29, indicating that the asset is approaching oversold territory. The MACD level is -1.376, and the Stochastic indicator stands at 26.34, both suggesting bearish momentum. The Simple Moving Averages over 10 and 100 days are $182.89 and $193.52 respectively, pointing to a short-term downward trend. Despite the recent downturn, Solana may find strong support at $188, with a secondary support level at $154. If the bulls regain strength, the price could rise to the nearest resistance level at $256, and potentially reach the second resistance level at $290. This would represent an increase of approximately 22% to 40% from the current price range. Given the altcoin season expectations and the overall bullish sentiment in the crypto market, Solana has the potential to recover and possibly surpass these levels. Conclusion ETH, XRP, and SOL are promising, but XYZVerse stands out with its sports memecoin , aiming for massive growth and community-driven success in the current bull run.

38009516,https://invezz.com/?p=2400965,1734963978,El Salvador rings in Christmas 2024 with a Bitcoin twist,"El Salvador continues to showcase its unwavering commitment to Bitcoin, doubling down on its cryptocurrency strategy despite stringent restrictions imposed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). On 19 December 2024, the country purchased an additional 11 Bitcoin (BTC), valued at over $1 million, pushing its total reserves to nearly 6,000 BTC. This comes on the heels of a $1.4 billion IMF loan, which introduces measures that seemingly conflict with El Salvador’s pro-Bitcoin policies. The nation is not backing down, reaffirming its vision of BTC as a long-term asset and an integral part of its financial future. IMF loan imposes strict cryptocurrency curbs The $1.4 billion IMF loan, signed on 18 December 2024, comes with stipulations that heavily regulate El Salvador’s cryptocurrency landscape. Businesses are no longer required to accept BTC as payment, taxes must be paid exclusively in US dollars, and the state-backed Chivo wallet, launched in 2021 to facilitate Bitcoin transactions, must cease operations. These conditions reflect the IMF’s broader stance favouring traditional monetary practices over decentralised digital currencies. Such measures raise questions about the sovereignty of El Salvador’s financial policies, with critics arguing that IMF loans often restrict a nation’s autonomy. The institution’s demands typically align with global financial norms, discouraging the use of cryptocurrencies in favour of centralised banking systems. El Salvador’s BTC reserves grow amid global scrutiny Despite external pressures, El Salvador remains steadfast in its commitment to Bitcoin. As of December 2024, the country holds 5,995 BTC, valued at approximately $569.5 million. With an average acquisition cost of $97,000 per BTC, the government views its holdings as a long-term investment. While the portfolio recently experienced a $6.08 million decline due to market volatility, its overall balance history reveals consistent growth, particularly in 2024. The National Bitcoin Office, established in 2021 to spearhead the country’s cryptocurrency initiatives, has reiterated that no Bitcoin from the reserves will be sold, further demonstrating El Salvador’s confidence in the asset’s future potential. A calculated bet on Bitcoin’s financial promise El Salvador’s decision to embrace Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021 was a bold move that has since become a defining feature of its economic strategy. While the IMF’s restrictions pose challenges, the government continues to invest in cryptocurrency as a means of fostering financial independence and reducing reliance on global institutions. The symbolism of El Salvador’s Bitcoin-themed Christmas tree for 2024 underscores the country’s deep integration of cryptocurrency into its cultural and financial identity. Despite criticism from traditional financial entities, El Salvador is charting its own path, positioning Bitcoin as a cornerstone of its economic future.

Dogecoin, a well-known memecoin, continues to thrive on its strong, community-driven backing, while XRP maintains its leadership in cross-border payment solutions. Lightchain AI, currently priced at $0.003, introduces an innovative approach by combining artificial intelligence with blockchain technology. This article explores the key strengths of these altcoins and evaluates their potential to deliver substantial gains. Dogecoin’s Momentum Community and Adoption Driving Growth Dogecoin’s appeal lies in its simplicity and massive community support. Created as a joke, it evolved into a cultural phenomenon, gaining traction as a payment method. Its surge during past bull runs highlights its potential for rapid growth, particularly when fueled by celebrity endorsements like Elon Musk’s. However, Dogecoin’s inflationary tokenomics, which add billions of DOGE to circulation annually, limit its long-term price sustainability. While DOGE could deliver significant returns in short-term market rallies, its ability to reach 10,000% gains depends heavily on speculative hype. Plus, Dogecoin faces competition from numerous other memecoins, some of which could gain popularity and erode its market share. XRP’s Resilience Cross-Border Payments and Regulatory Wins XRP has demonstrated remarkable resilience by streamlining cross-border payments and achieving significant regulatory milestones. Ripple's On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service utilizes XRP as a bridge currency, enabling near-instantaneous international transactions and reducing reliance on pre-funded accounts. This innovation addresses inefficiencies in the traditional $27 trillion cross-border payment market. Additionally, the New York Department of Financial Services recently approved Ripple's stablecoin, RLUSD, further enhancing XRP's utility in digital payments. These developments underscore XRP's pivotal role in modernizing global financial systems. Lightchain AI’s Innovation Disruptive Newcomer Lightchain AI (LCAI) is emerging as a game-changer, blending blockchain technology with artificial intelligence to solve real-world challenges. Its innovative features position it as a leading contender for substantial growth. Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) LCAI empowers developers to create AI-enhanced decentralized applications (dApps), offering solutions in sectors like healthcare, logistics, and finance. By enabling real-time AI operations on the blockchain, it redefines the potential of decentralized platforms. Proof of Intelligence (PoI) Lightchain AI introduces a unique consensus mechanism that incentivizes network participants for executing AI tasks. This approach ensures efficient resource utilization while driving real-world applicability in AI advancements. Deflationary Tokenomics With a portion of transaction fees burned, Lightchain AI reduces its token supply over time, creating scarcity and enhancing long-term value for holders. Priced at just $0.003 during its presale, Lightchain AI offers early investors a ground-floor opportunity to join a pioneering project. The platform's strategic roadmap, including milestones like the mainnet launch and ecosystem expansion by 2025, sets the stage for exponential growth, making LCAI one of the most promising altcoins on the market. Why Lightchain AI Could Be Poised for 10,000% Gains Lightchain AI has the potential to deliver 10,000% gains due to its strategic positioning and market-focused approach. Unlike speculative tokens, LCAI emphasizes real-world applications across industries such as healthcare, finance, and logistics. Its roadmap includes phases for ecosystem expansion, global adoption, and strategic partnerships, which are critical for long-term growth. The project’s deflationary tokenomics play a key role in driving value, with token-burning mechanisms reducing supply and creating scarcity as demand increases. Early-stage pricing at $0.003 allows investors to enter at a low cost, with significant upside potential as the token’s utility grows. By leveraging its focus on solving real-world problems and establishing itself as a versatile solution across industries, Lightchain AI is well-positioned to achieve exponential growth and potentially reach the projected 10,000% gains. Comparing the Prospects of the Three Altcoins When evaluating Dogecoin, XRP, and Lightchain AI (LCAI) , each offers distinct value propositions tailored to different investor profiles. Dogecoin thrives on its memecoin appeal and vibrant community but is hindered by its inflationary tokenomics, making it better suited for speculative, short-term gains. XRP, on the other hand, focuses on cross-border payments, showcasing utility-driven, stable growth backed by institutional adoption and Ripple’s financial partnerships, though it lacks the speculative surges seen in other assets. Lightchain AI disrupts the market through the integration of blockchain and AI, targeting real-world industries like healthcare and logistics. Its deflationary tokenomics, low-entry presale price of $0.003, and innovative roadmap make it a strong candidate for exponential, long-term growth. Ready To Dive Into $LCAI? You’re still here?

ChainLink enables smart contracts on the Ethereum platform, streamlining business transactions and eliminating third-party intervention. Real-world projects include partnerships with Sygnum, SWIFT, and UBS Asset Management, enhancing transparency and efficiency in financial transactions. ChainLink supports Web3 gaming and collaborates with AccuWeather for smart contract applications, showcasing its versatility and broad utility. ChainLink USD ( LINK-USD ) has lots of upside price potential as it has actual real-life utility in various areas of the business world. The recent dip in price presents a good buying opportunity. ChainLink has a good chance to ride the Bitcoin & crypto bull market in 2025. ChainLink USD's Background ChainLink is considered an oracle that takes off-chain data and places it onto the blockchain in a secure manner. ChainLink was created in 2017 by Sergey Nazarov and Steve Ellis, who co-authored the original whitepaper with Ari Juels, a professor from Cornell University. ChainLink operates on the Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) platform as a cryptocurrency. This functionality enables various decentralized services. One important service that ChainLink enables is smart contracts, which are a set of instructions that can be executed without intervention from third parties. An example of a smart contract looks something like this: If goods arrive on time, then execute a payment from the retailer to the supplier for the full amount. If the goods arrive one day late, then execute a payment for 99% of the full amount. Another example includes financial services where if a user deposits collateral into a specific smart contract, then they could get a loan up to 50% of the value of the collateral. Additional terms can be set up. For example, another term could be: if the collateral/loan value drops to a certain level, then the user's collateral would be automatically liquidated and transferred to the lenders. Another term could be lenders depositing funds into a smart contract. Other users can borrow from pre-defined collateralization ratios, while the lender receives interest on the loan. We can see from these examples how smart contracts could speed up business transactions and make them more objective & reliable, while eliminating the need for third parties to execute them. Current Real-World Projects Using ChainLink ChainLink is involved in hundreds of projects in the areas of decentralized finance [DeFi], blockchain, NFTs, gaming, tech project building, and data providing. Here are a few examples of ChainLink's partnerships/real-world projects. ChainLink Partnerships (CoinGape.com) One major trend for ChainLink is that global finance is moving onchain. Earlier this year, ChainLink partnered with Sygnum and Fidelity International to provide fund Net Asset Value [NAV] data onchain. Sygnum is a global digital asset banking group that tokenized $50 million of Matter Labs' company treasury reserves. These reserves are held in Fidelity International's money market fund and were issued on the ZKSync blockchain. ChainLink enables the NAV data to be accurately reported and synchronized onchain in an automated and secure way. This provides real-time transparency and built-in access to historical data for Sygnum, its customers, and for other market participants. In addition to this collaboration, ChainLink also enables NAV data to securely spread across any blockchain or existing offchain system. ChainLink collaborated with SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications) and UBS Asset Management to bridge tokenized assets with existing payment systems. This project enables digital asset transactions to settle with fiat payment systems across more than 11,500 financial institutions and over 200 countries/territories. This solves the inefficiencies involved in the subscription and redemption process such as manual interventions, lack of real-time transparency, and delayed settlements. These inefficiencies can increase costs, reduce liquidity, and lead to missed investment opportunities in the $63 trillion global mutual fund market. Sergey Nazarov, one of the founders of ChainLink believes that the upcoming adoption of these payment capabilities will increase the flow of capital and expand the possible user base of digital assets. ChainLink supports Web3 gaming, which uses the blockchain to decentralize the game experience, giving the players more control. ChainLink oracle networks power top blockchain gaming apps, which helps provide dynamic and unpredictable gaming experiences. This enables fairly distributed rewards based on randomness or predefined achievements. It also allows for an unbiased game winner selection, which increases fairness and transparency. Also, it allows for truly dynamic NFTs that react to offline data or time/state changes. AccuWeather launched a ChainLink node to supply and sell data directly to smart contract apps running on multiple blockchains. AccuWeather also uses the node to cryptographically sign its data so that users know for sure that it originated from them. Here are some use cases that AccuWeather is implementing with smart contracts via ChainLink: weather prediction market for hedging against future droughts or sea level rises, parametric crop and natural disaster insurance for regions where it is currently inaccessible, supply chain automation that shifts due to forecast alerts, and digital artwork using NFTs that change based on weather conditions. Wingman is an airline flight delay prediction app that has a live node on ChainLink. Wingman is built on the Polygon ( MATIC-USD ) blockchain. Wingman is designed to transform idle airport wait time into an opportunity for profit. The app allows users to predict flight delays and rewards them with MATIC cryptocurrency for accurate predictions. Wingman also has an AI prediction system designed to forecast future flight delays, giving users valuable insights. Those were just a few of the hundreds of projects that ChainLink is involved in. ChainLink's investment Opportunity ChainLink Labs is the company that is behind this technology. However, ChainLink Labs is not a publicly traded company. So, the opportunity for investors is to buy the cryptocurrency known as ChainLink USD at brokerages [ Coinbase ( COIN ), Robinhood ( HOOD ), etc.] or platforms that offer it. To consider investing in ChainLink, investors should have a good understanding of Bitcoin's ( BTC-USD ) halving cycle. The prices of all other cryptocurrencies tend to correlate with the price of Bitcoin. However, ChainLink did trade with different patterns as compared to Bitcoin in its first few years. You can see my opinion on how Bitcoin may perform in 2025 at this link. Since ChainLink the cryptocurrency doesn't have revenue or earnings, we can use Bitcoin's cycle and technical analysis to determine how the coin may perform in 2025. Based on past cycles, Bitcoin is projected to experience a bull market until about October 2025. Of course, Bitcoin and ChainLink do experience significant declines within bull markets. This past week marked one of these declines as the price of ChainLink declined from about $31 down to about $20 before recovering a bit to the current price of about $22. At the same time, Bitcoin dropped from about $108 down to about $92,000 before recovering a bit to the $97,000s. ChainLink's Monthly Chart ChainLink (LINK-USD) Monthly Price Chart with RSI and MACD (TradingView) We can see on ChainLink's monthly chart above that the price tends to top out after the purple RSI line (middle of the chart) moves above the 80 level. ChainLink's RSI is currently in the $63 to $64 range. So, there is likely to be more upside if the current Bitcoin bull market lasts as long as previous cycles. I noted in my last Bitcoin article that the past 2 bull cycles lasted exactly 1,064 days. So, that is why many are projecting October 2025 as the possible top for the current bull market. Therefore, I see the recent dip as a buying opportunity for those who haven't bought ChainLink yet. The current price dropped back down to a prior resistance level around $22. It is possible that it holds this level and turns it into support. If the $22 support level holds, the price may test the next level of resistance between $29 and $31. If the $22 level doesn't hold, it could drop down into the teens, where prior support exists at about $15. ChainLink's Long-Term Outlook As for a long-term projection to about October 2025 (where Bitcoin price may peak), my educated guess says that the price would at least reach the all-time high in the low $50s. Other analysts have more optimistic projections for the price to reach $100 by this time . Others are less optimistic with a price projection of about $45. The target price of $100 looks realistic considering that the price has gone significantly higher during each Bitcoin halving cycle. Increased adoption of ChainLink into more projects can be the catalyst for the price over the long-term beyond 2025. The risk for ChainLink is that the price is highly volatile - even more than Bitcoin. The price could drop 90% from the top of a cycle to the bottom of the cycle. So, investors might consider taking profits when the RSI reaches 80 as this is where the price tends to peak in past cycles. Another risk is that ChainLink's competitors could be considered more attractive for new projects. This could take market share away from ChainLink and threaten its long-term growth. ChainLink competes with Pyth ( PYTH-USD ) which has experienced strong growth in the past year. Other competitors include: WINkLink ( WIN-USD ), Chronicle , and Switchboard . Currently, ChainLink dominates market share among this group with about 47% of the market. WINkLink has the next highest market share with about 16%. Pyth is next in line with about 11% of the market. Various other competitors comprise the remaining 26% of the market. If ChainLink is successful in maintaining and growing its market share, then the price could go significantly higher through the remainder of the decade. Investors should consider ChainLink as highly speculative due to the uncertainties regarding its success and its price action. Therefore, only invest an amount of money in ChainLink that you are willing to lose.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4745999-chainlink-usd-likely-to-ride-crypto-wave-in-2025?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/38008058.jpeg
38009512,https://invezz.com/?p=2401017,1734963685,Securitize proposes BlackRock’s BUIDL as collateral for FRAX stablecoin,"Securitize, the real-world asset tokenization platform behind BlackRock’s BUIDL fund, is seeking Frax Finance community approval to adopt the tokenized US treasuries fund as collateral for the Frax USD stablecoin. Frax Finance announced on Monday that Securitize had submitted a proposal looking to integrate BUIDL with the frxUSD stablecoin. Securitize partnered with BlackRock to launch BUIDL earlier this year , with the tokenized short-term US Treasury bills fund growing into a $530 million asset. Frax DAO community support Community feedback and discussion on the proposal has been strong and mostly in support. Per the Frax DAO community forum page, investors and FRAX holders say the integration will be key to bringing traditional finance to the expanding decentralized finance market. BUIDL will add fiat redeemability to frxUSD. What this means is that leading crypto exchanges and market makers could soon integrate the stablecoin, helping unlock fresh distribution. Adding the tokenized fund as collateral to Frax USD will therefore not only help reduce counterparty risk, but also bolster yield opportunities. According to the proposal, it also means deeper liquidity, which will benefit the community. BlackRock’s BUIDL has over the past several months seen integrations as collateral for multiple stablecoins. These include Elixir Protocol’s deUSD and Ethena Labs’ USDtb. The latter is a recently launched stablecoin primarily backed by BUIDL fund. During its unveiling, Ethena Labs said USDtb will hold more than 90% of its reserves in the BlackRock tokenized money market Like other stablecoins, USDtb holds reserve assets to back every token. USDtb launched in December 2024 and saw over $65 million in total value locked on its debut. Growth of RWA market Securitize’s proposal comes as the RWA market gains massive traction with various products and funds. TradFi to DeFi trend is one of the driving factors for the RWA on-chain growth to a global sector of over $14.6 billion within the past year. The tokenized US treasuries market on the other hand has grown to over $3.5 billion, with BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, Ondo Finance, Hashnote, OpenEden and Superstate key players. Indeed, tokenized funds provider Superstate is also one of the platforms looking to tap into frxUSD growth potential. In its proposal , the platform said it is considering backing frxUSD with its Short Duration US Government Securities Fund (USTB). The firm also targets its Superstate Crypto Carry Fund (USCC) for frxUSD. Notably, Superstate is eyeing $100 million of USTB and $20 million in USCC to back the Frax stablecoin.

38008324,https://blockworks.co/news/robinhood-tokenization-efforts,1734963680,Robinhood wants to be a tokenization ‘pioneer’,"This is a segment from the Empire newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . That seems to have been Robinhood’s approach to crypto this past year, from its Bitstamp acquisition (still expected to close in the first half of next year) to its response to the Wells notice it received from the SEC. The firm has shown an interest and, dare I say, commitment to crypto. Johann Kerbrat told me that’s not changing anytime soon and, if anything, the “enthusiasm in crypto,” is serving to help the firm as it plots out the upcoming year. But even before the bullishness really took off after Donald Trump won the presidential election, the firm reported $38 billion in crypto assets under custody as of November 2024. And while Kerbrat wasn’t able to provide a more updated number, he did note that the company’s seen an increase in engagement if you’re looking at customer behavior, echoing what he told Empire back in October. “In November alone, we did more than $3 billion in volume, which is, I think, almost twice as much as Q3,” he added. “If you look at the activity onchain … we see people buying on Robinhood, transferring to their self-custody wallet or transferring to other places,” he noted. To put these figures in perspective, this is just a year after Robinhood’s trading revenues tanked in the same quarter back in 2023. Kerbrat’s also noticed a tick up in NFT activity. While activity is still way down from 2022 (to no one’s surprise), it’s looking like sales will either match or fall just under last year’s total figure, according to data from CryptoSlam. As of right now, with a little over a week left in the year, NFT global sales volume sits at $8.69 billion. Last year, that figure totaled $8.71 billion. If we’re just looking at the average sale in US dollars, though, then this year outperformed last year at $122 on average in comparison to 2023’s $95. Source: CryptoSlam! Europe has also been a big focus for Robinhood this year, arguably one of their bigger years in terms of expanding their EU footprint. However, that looks poised to change once the aforementioned Bitget acquisition closes . But it’s not just Bitget that has Kerbrat’s attention next year. He and his team are eager to “do more in tokenization,” he said. The firm, alongside Kraken, Paxos and others, announced the Global Dollar Network based on a new stablecoin offering, USDG , earlier this year. “We want to be a pioneer” in tokenization, he told me, given that the publicly-traded company feels like it can “bring a lot to the table.” He’s also starting to loosely look into artificial intelligence, but he’s wary due to how narratives tend to play out (story gets big, then bad actors come in to prey on the weak). Specifically, his concern is focused on AI being used for deep fake videos that could be used to scam people. But that’s not to say he doesn’t think AI and crypto can find common ground. “I think the intersection between crypto and AI is something that I’m following pretty closely. When I hear a lot of the issues around AI right now on like micro payments or fair remuneration of the data that is training the models you handle, like personal information, all this kind of thing, makes me feel like … we can actually combine [crypto and AI] and get somewhere that is pretty exciting,” he explained.

38007935,https://coinpaper.com/6689/former-football-star-bo-hines-named-head-of-trump-s-crypto-council,1734963606,Former Football Star Bo Hines Named Head of Trump’s Crypto Council,"Bo Hines will work under Donald Trump’s crypto and AI czar David Sacks. Trump also recently appointed Sriram Krishnan as AI policy adviser and Stephen Miran as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors. This aligns with Trump’s vision of making the U.S. a global crypto leader. Meanwhile, MicroStrategy added former Binance.US CEO Brian Brooks to its board as it joins the Nasdaq-100 Index, and Mohammad Shaikh stepped down as Aptos Labs CEO. Co-founder Avery Ching will be taking the helm to guide the layer-1 blockchain into its next growth phase. Bo Hines to Head the New Crypto Council Donald Trump announced the appointment of former college football player Bo Hines as the executive director of his administration’s new “Crypto Council.” In a post on Truth Social from Dec. 22, the president-elect confirmed that Hines, a Republican candidate who narrowly lost North Carolina’s U.S. House race in 2022, will lead the Presidential Council of Advisers for Digital Assets. Hines’ political background includes support from crypto-focused political action committees, including the American Dream Federal Action super PAC. He also benefited from contributions made by former FTX CEO Ryan Salame, who is currently serving a seven-year prison sentence for crimes related to unlawful political donations. Salame’s contributions to Republican candidates, including Hines, amounted to about $13.4 million in 2022. In addition to Hines’ appointment, Trump named Sriram Krishnan , a former general partner at Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), as the senior AI policy adviser to the Crypto Council. Krishnan pledged to work closely with David Sacks to ensure the United States maintains its leadership in artificial intelligence. These appointments reinforce Trump’s strong pro-crypto stance, which was a cornerstone of his presidential campaign. His promise to position the United States as the “world capital of crypto” earned a lot of financial backing from leading industry executives. Trump also continued to bring crypto advocates into influential roles, including billionaire Elon Musk and former SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins, the latter of whom has been nominated to chair the Securities and Exchange Commission. Stephen Miran Also Joins Trump’s Pro-Crypto Administration President-elect Donald Trump also nominated economist and former advisor Stephen Miran as the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors. His decision was announced on Dec. 22 via social media, and Miran’s role will involve providing economic policy guidance to the Executive Branch. Miran previously served as a senior adviser for economic policy at the U.S. Treasury Department during Trump’s first administration. In a recent episode of The Bitcoin Layer podcast, he talked about the importance of pro-innovation policies, including financial deregulation, and suggested that crypto could play a pivotal role in driving economic growth under the new administration. The crypto community largely welcomed Miran’s nomination, and sees it as yet another step in Trump’s ongoing support for pro-crypto and pro-innovation officials. Trump’s pro-crypto agenda sparked a lot of optimism in the market, and many people predict major growth for Bitcoin. Cathie Wood, founder of ARK Invest, forecasted a $1 million Bitcoin price by 2030 due to the administration’s supportive policies. Eric Trump, the President-elect’s son, agrees with Woods and believes Bitcoin’s supply scarcity will be a key factor driving its value to seven figures. Brian Brooks Joins MicroStrategy Board Things are not only changing on the political front. MicroStrategy, the Bitcoin-focused software company, appointed former Binance.US CEO Brian Brooks, Jane Dietze, and Gregg Winiarski to its board of directors, bringing the total number of board members to nine. The announcement was shared in a Dec. 20 filing with the SEC, and coincides with MicroStrategy’s inclusion in the Nasdaq-100 Index that is set to take effect on Dec. 23. Brooks was a former acting Comptroller of the Currency and is a well known figure in the crypto industry. Swan Bitcoin described the appointment as a “BIG deal” due to Brooks’ deep connections in the U.S. banking system and his regulatory expertise. Brooks resigned from Binance.US in August of 2021 after less than four months as CEO because of strategic differences. His recent appointment to MicroStrategy’s board fueled speculation about his influence on the company’s strategic direction. Crypto commentator MacroScope is very impressed with the quality of the new board members, and called all three appointments beneficial for the company. The appointment happened on the heels of Nasdaq’s decision to add MicroStrategy to its prestigious Nasdaq-100 Index , recognizing it as one of the 100 largest companies by market capitalization. Alongside MicroStrategy, Palantir Technologies and Axon Enterprise are also being added to the index, while Illumina, Super Micro Computer, and Moderna are set to be removed. MicroStrategy transitioned into a de facto Bitcoin hedge fund in 2020, and still continues to make headlines with its strategic moves in the crypto and corporate space. Mohammad Shaikh Steps down as Aptos Labs CEO Mohammad Shaikh, co-founder and CEO of Aptos Labs, recently stepped down from his role to pursue new opportunities. Co-founder and CTO Avery Ching will be taking over as CEO. The move was announced in a Dec. 19 post on X, and Shaikh expressed his confidence in Aptos Labs’ future and the team’s ability to achieve the company’s vision. Ching is expected to lead Aptos Labs into its next phase of growth, with a focus on expanding the ecosystem’s builder community across regions like India, Vietnam, South Korea, Japan, and China. Aptos Labs is known for its layer-1 proof-of-stake blockchain, and aims to deliver scalability, security, and high transaction speeds. The platform uses the Move programming language that was initially developed for Meta’s Diem project. Since its inception in 2021, Shaikh has played a pivotal role in raising $400 million for the project and securing strategic partnerships with major companies like BlackRock, Google, Microsoft, Mastercard, and Franklin Templeton. Under his leadership, Aptos also launched its mainnet in October of 2022 and positioned itself as a competitor to other major blockchains like Ethereum, Solana, and Sui. In its own announcement, Aptos Labs still promised to deliver major technical advancements by 2025. The news of Shaikh’s departure was met with praise from industry stakeholders. Crypto research firm Token Relations even thanked him for his contributions to building Aptos into a prominent blockchain platform. While Shaikh will remain a strategic adviser, he plans to take time to reflect on the future of finance and how Aptos can solidify its position as a leading layer-1 blockchain. APT price action over the past week (Source: CoinMarketCap ) The Aptos (APT) token has a market cap of $5.1 billion, and saw minimal impact from the announcement. The token did, however, experience a more than 30% price drop over the past week of trading.

Currently priced at just $0.003 during its presale , forecasts predict a significant price increase to $2 by Q1 2025. Known for its innovative integration of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology, Lightchain AI is positioned to be a disruptive player in the crypto market. As interest grows among early investors, LCAI is quickly becoming a noteworthy altcoin to watch ahead of the next market bull run. Why Lightchain AI Is Being Compared to Cardano Cardano has long been celebrated for its methodical approach to blockchain technology, with a strong emphasis on scalability and sustainability. Its layered architecture and focus on peer-reviewed research have established it as a leader in the decentralized space. However, its gradual evolution has left room for competitors like Lightchain AI to step in with faster and more adaptive solutions. Lightchain AI builds on some of Cardano’s strengths while pushing the boundaries of innovation even further. Unlike Cardano, which excels in infrastructure, Lightchain AI integrates artificial intelligence into its core with features like the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) and the Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism. These advancements enable real-world applications that extend beyond Cardano’s traditional blockchain use cases, making Lightchain AI a compelling contender in the blockchain space. Technological Features Driving LCAI’s Growth Potential Lightchain AI's standout features have made it one of the most talked-about tokens in the presale market. Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM)The AIVM enables developers to deploy AI-powered decentralized applications (dApps) on the blockchain, creating new opportunities in predictive analytics, healthcare solutions, and logistics management. Proof of Intelligence (PoI)PoI rewards network participants for performing valuable AI computations, making the network energy-efficient and utility-driven. This unique approach aligns with the growing demand for green and scalable blockchain solutions. Deflationary TokenomicsA deflationary mechanism ensures that a portion of transaction fees is burned, reducing the circulating supply over time. This structure is designed to boost the token's value as adoption grows. Price Predictions From $0.003 to $2 by Q1 2025 Lightchain AI (LCAI) has the potential to surge from $0.003 to $2 by Q1 2025 due to its strong market positioning and strategic growth plan. The token's price projection is fueled by its detailed roadmap, which includes testnet deployment, mainnet launch, and ecosystem expansion. Strategic partnerships and real-world use cases are expected to drive increased adoption and demand for LCAI tokens . Additionally, its deflationary tokenomics play a key role in this growth by reducing supply over time, enhancing scarcity, and driving value appreciation. The project’s focus on global adoption, industry integration, and community engagement positions it to capitalize on growing market trends. These factors combine to create a compelling case for significant price growth, making the $2 target achievable. How Lightchain AI Outshines Its Competitors While Cardano, Solana, and Ethereum have made their mark as blockchain giants, Lightchain AI is stepping into the spotlight with a fresh twist—combining blockchain with artificial intelligence (AI). This unique approach makes Lightchain AI a forward-thinking, versatile platform that’s ready for the future. Real-World Impact Across Industries Lightchain AI isn’t just about tech for tech’s sake. It’s designed to tackle real-world problems in industries like finance, logistics, and healthcare. With AI-powered features like predictive analytics, supply chain optimization, and advanced healthcare diagnostics, it goes beyond the narrower scope of many other platforms. Moving Fast Lightchain AI isn’t wasting time. Its testnet is set to launch in January 2025, with the mainnet following quickly in March 2025. This fast-paced roadmap shows how serious the team is about delivering usable and scalable solutions faster than most competitors did in their early days. Smart Tech with an Edge Lightchain AI brings some cool tech to the table. Its Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus system actually rewards AI-specific tasks, making the network more efficient and scalable. Plus, its Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) lets developers easily build smart dApps that blend blockchain and AI like never before. A Deflationary Model Instead of going the inflationary route like some platforms, Lightchain AI takes a deflationary approach. A portion of transaction fees gets burned, reducing the token supply over time. This scarcity boosts long-term value for token holders and paves the way for sustainable growth. Lightchain AI is shaping up to be a game-changer with its AI-driven blockchain innovations—and it’s moving fast to make an impact. Lightchain AI Is the Next Big Thing in Crypto As Lightchain AI builds momentum, it’s clear why analysts are calling it the next Cardano. With its presale price of $0.003 and a projected rise to $2 by Q1 2025, LCAI offers a ground-floor opportunity for early adopters. Its advanced AI-driven blockchain technology, combined with a deflationary token model, positions it as a standout investment in the rapidly evolving crypto landscape. As the market continues to mature and demand for sustainable, efficient blockchain solutions grows, Lightchain AI is well-positioned for exponential growth in the coming years. It’s an exciting time to be a part of this innovative project and witness its potential as it disrupts traditional boundaries in both blockchain and artificial intelligence. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

38007787,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/analog-announces-mainnet-launch-aiming-to-redefine-blockchain-interoperability,1734963322,Analog Announces Mainnet Launch Aiming To Redefine Blockchain Interoperability,"The platform also announced a transformative roadmap to support the mainnet launch including several new features and upgrades such as a Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS) consensus mechanism. Marking a monumental advancement for the multi-chain ecosystem, Analog has launched its mainnet which will be live as of today, December 23 2024. By doing so, developers who build advanced decentralized applications (dApps) that operate across numerous blockchain networks stand to be empowered as the launch sets the stage for future enhancements. Additionally, this launch will work to build on the momentum of a successful testnet which demonstrated the platform’s capabilities. With over 345,000 accounts and 1.9 million cross-chain datasets created, Analog has firmly cemented its dominance in the interoperability space. This has seen a lot of confidence boost from the market towards Analog. The Analog mainnet, upon its launch, will go beyond the conventional blockchain network by serving as an interoperability hub that will streamline cross-chain developments. It intends to do so since it will be in a position to leverage the platform’s tools to create applications that are capable of reacting to different events across different blockchain ecosystems, a move that will effectively make it a one-stop shop for multi-chain solutions. And, while Analog’s roadmap includes transformative upgrades such as a Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS) consensus mechanism, efficient cross-chain messaging, and powerful data querying capabilities, the features will be slated for phased integration, culminating in full functionality by the Token Generation Event (TGE). Analog’s path to mainnet success was paved by a thorough three-phase testnet process which saw the results being impressive. This is owed to the impressive engagement metrics that saw over 12 million website visits and 345,000 active accounts. Additionally, there were more than 1.9 million cross-chain datasets generated from over 290,000 smart contracts. Not to leave out, there were over 42,000 users who were verified using the Proof of Humanity (PoH) for the preparation of a genuine, robust and active community that will interact with the mainnet right from its launch. When it comes to its versatility, Analog reflects the same through its wide selection of projects that are already built on the platform. Some of the notable projects include StationX which has utilized Analog’s automation tools to streamline processes such as fund distribution and trigger-based actions; Parami Protocol which has integrated Analog to enable AI agents to interact with communities across multiple chains; Frax Finance , which has employed Analog’s tools for real-time oracle data and cross-chain governance, all of which have worked out when it comes to enhancing transparency and functionality; XYO , a leader in geo-location technology which uses Analog’s cross-chain tools to provide accessible DePIN-backed data and Vemo Network which transforms locked crypto assets into tradable NFTs by utilizing Analog’s ability to represent assets across multiple chains. As for Analog’s developer’s kit, it features solutions like Analog Watch, which is a cross-chain data indexing solution akin to The Graph but is tailored for multi-chain ecosystems, and automation workflows. It works to reduce manual effort, and at the same time enable developers to focus on innovation as opposed to integration. It is through the incorporation of such tools that the next wave of decentralized applications which will provide a secure and scalable foundation is catalyzed for the betterment of the users and developers alike. By positioning itself as a secure and chain-agnostic interoperability hub, Analog will be able to deliver on its mission of simplifying the multi-chain experience and further fostering a more interconnected and accessible blockchain ecosystem.

This Lightchain AI Could Be the Next 10,000x Opportunity","Solana’s remarkable growth trajectory has left countless investors regretting not joining early. Now, a new contender — Lightchain AI (LCAI) — has emerged, bringing with it the potential to outshine Solana’s achievements. Priced at just $0.003 during its presale , LCAI merges artificial intelligence and blockchain to offer an innovative investment opportunity. Let’s explore why Lightchain AI may redefine the market and deliver returns like no other. Pioneering Smart Automation in the Blockchain World Lightchain AI’s emphasis on intelligent automation sets it apart. With its focus on revolutionizing industries through autonomous systems, LCAI has quickly become the crypto space’s leading innovator. The Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) ensures faster, smarter transactions, enabling industries like supply chain logistics and predictive analytics to thrive. Beyond finance, its real-world applications bring blockchain into manufacturing, urban development, and even autonomous transportation. LCAI is paving the way for self-sustaining dApps, minimizing human intervention while maximizing operational efficiency—a capability Solana lacks. Tackling Scalability Without Compromising Security One of blockchain's greatest challenges has been achieving scalability while maintaining security. Lightchain AI tackles this with its groundbreaking Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism. Unlike traditional blockchains, PoI enables LCAI to handle massive volumes of AI computations securely. This is vital for projects integrating AI solutions like real-time surveillance or global trade. Where Solana gained traction for its speed, Lightchain AI is advancing scalability for more complex, computation-heavy use cases. This evolution highlights LCAI’s preparedness for the demands of AI-enhanced blockchain systems. A Roadmap Geared Toward Long-Term Dominance The meticulous planning behind Lightchain AI’s roadmap demonstrates its commitment to sustained growth and innovation. Key milestones include: Mainnet Launch (2025): This will introduce the AIVM to broader markets. Cross-Chain Compatibility: Seamlessly integrates with other networks, fostering interoperability. AI Consortium Partnerships: Collaborating with tech giants to implement AI-based solutions on a global scale. With clear deadlines and tangible goals, Lightchain AI is positioning itself for success, unlike projects that promise but underdeliver. Lightchain AI vs Solana: Beyond the Hype While Solana’s rise was driven by its groundbreaking Proof of History consensus and NFT adoption, Lightchain AI targets a broader spectrum of applications. Key Comparisons: Target Market: Solana excels in NFTs, whereas LCAI focuses on AI-enhanced governance and industrial-grade applications. Technology Edge: LCAI’s AIVM introduces an entirely new way of processing blockchain data with AI efficiency. Longevity: Lightchain AI’s deflationary tokenomics and ecosystem-first approach ensure lasting appeal. For investors who missed Solana’s early days, Lightchain AI presents an upgraded opportunity with a larger technological scope. Why Smart Investors Are Doubling Down on LCAI The early success of Lightchain AI’s presale signals massive interest from savvy investors. Analysts point to its unmatched price-to-value ratio as a prime reason why it’s capturing attention. Early-stage investors are already likening Lightchain AI to pre-launch Ethereum, where minimal initial investments yielded exponential growth over time. Its presale buzz, combined with its innovative roadmap, suggests that LCAI could deliver unprecedented returns. Plus, the AIVM’s AI integration could lead to a more organic demand for LCAI tokens, driven by dApps built on its platform. This potential for sustainable growth is what sets Lightchain AI apart from mere hype-driven projects. Ready To Dive Into $LCAI?

38007766,https://coinpedia.org/?p=396705,1734963245,Top 5 Blockchains by TVL in 2024: Eth Dominates DeFi,"The post Top 5 Blockchains by TVL in 2024: Eth Dominates DeFi appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News If you are into DeFi, you definitely have heard the term “Total Value Locked” before. It’s basically a way to measure how much value is secured within the smart contracts of a blockchain. The higher the TVL, the more adoption a blockchain usually has in DeFi. Here are the top 5 blockchains by TVL that are ruling the DeFi space: Ethereum, Tron, Solana, Binance Smart Chain (BSC), and Arbitrum. Together, they dominate the DeFi scene. But here’s a surprise—Bitcoin isn’t even in the top 10 by TVL. Weird, right? Let’s dive into what makes these blockchains tick and why Bitcoin isn’t one of them. Source : CoinMarketCap Ethereum: The King of DeFi TVL: $121.26 billion Protocols: 1,354 Market Cap: $391.73 billion TVL Change: -0.71% (1 day), -17.11% (1 week), +1.09% (1 month) Ethereum sits comfortably at the top. No one’s even close to dethroning it. With over a thousand protocols and the highest TVL, it’s the go-to blockchain for DeFi projects. Sure, there’s been a slight dip over the past week, but the monthly growth shows Ethereum isn’t slowing down anytime soon. Source : CoinMarketCap Tron and Solana: Solid Players but Not Without Issues Tron (TRX) TVL: $8.34 billion Protocols: 68 Market Cap: $20.97 billion TVL Change: -0.21% (1 day), -16.02% (1 week), -9.75% (1 month) Tron is doing pretty well, especially considering it only has 68 protocols. That’s tiny compared to Ethereum, but it still holds second place. Stablecoin operations are its bread and butter, which seems to work for now. Solana (SOL) TVL: $6.2 billion Protocols: 213 Market Cap: $86.01 billion TVL Change: -0.31% (1 day), -14.66% (1 week), -16.52% (1 month) Solana’s known for being fast and cheap, but it’s having a rough month. TVL is down quite a bit, and that’s something to keep an eye on. Still, it’s a favorite for developers, and that counts for a lot. Binance Smart Chain and Arbitrum: Focused on Scalability Binance Smart Chain (BSC) TVL: $6.05 billion Protocols: 862 Market Cap: $92.77 billion TVL Change: -0.96% (1 day), -9.20% (1 week), +0.82% (1 month) BSC’s strength lies in its scalability. Developers like it because it’s compatible with Ethereum, which makes transitioning easier. The recent TVL dip is noticeable, but its monthly growth shows some signs of recovery. Arbitrum (ARB) TVL: $3.41 billion Protocols: 773 Market Cap: $3.11 billion TVL Change: -0.67% (1 day), -16.36% (1 week), -5.42% (1 month) Arbitrum is a bit different. It’s not a standalone blockchain but a Layer-2 solution for Ethereum. It helps make Ethereum faster and cheaper to use, which is why people like it. What About Bitcoin? Here’s the curveball. Bitcoin could not get a place in the top 5 blockchains by TVL even though it is the biggest cryptocurrency by market cap. It ranks at 13th by total value locked. Its TVL is just $429.52 million. That’s wild, considering its dominance in the broader crypto space. Interestingly, Bitcoin’s TVL has grown by 52.82% this month. Maybe it’s starting to carve out a new role in DeFi? It’s too early to say, but the numbers are intriguing. What to Expect Ethereum isn’t going anywhere, and the competition is heating up. Even though in the whole crypto space Ethereum is at number two with a market dominance of 12.2%, in DeFi, it is the king with 64.90% dominance. Bitcoin’s role in DeFi is evolving, even if it’s nowhere near the top players. If you’re keeping tabs on DeFi trends, watching these blockchains might give you a clue about where the future of finance is heading.",NEUTRAL,SOL | ARB,BTC | ETH | MARKET | SOL | ARB,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/top-5-blockchains-by-tvl-in-2024-eth-dominates-defi/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen significant price movements recently. Over the past week, its price dropped by 22.05%. In the last month, it decreased by 13.66%. However, over six months, SHIB's price increased by 25.78%. This indicates that despite short-term declines, the coin has experienced growth in the longer term. The current price range of SHIB is between $0.00002396 and $0.00003200. The nearest resistance level is $0.00003614, and the nearest support level is $0.00002006. If the price rises toward the second resistance level at $0.00004418, it would represent a significant gain from current levels. On the other hand, dropping to the second support level of $0.00001202 would indicate a substantial decline. Technical indicators show mixed signals for SHIB. The Relative Strength Index is at 42.79, suggesting the coin is neither overbought nor oversold. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $0.00002174, and the 100-day average is $0.00002244, indicating a relatively stable trend. The MACD level is slightly negative, which may point to bearish momentum. Overall, SHIB's price could move in either direction based on market conditions. Pepe (PEPE) Over the past week, Pepe (PEPE) has experienced a price drop of 24.05%, settling within a range of $0.00002106 to $0.00002779. In the past month, the coin decreased by 14.81%. However, looking at the six-month timeline, PEPE has still gained 56.35%, showing significant growth over the longer term. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 49.30, indicating a neutral market sentiment. The Stochastic oscillator is at 60.19, suggesting potential upward momentum. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) level is 0.0000000454, which could hint at a bullish shift. The 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages are close, at $0.00001781 and $0.00001796 respectively, pointing to a possible consolidation phase. PEPE faces immediate resistance at $0.00003144. Breaking above this level could lead to the next resistance at $0.00003817, potentially resulting in gains of around 15% to 37%. On the downside, the nearest support is at $0.00001798, with a secondary support at $0.00001125. Falling below these points might lead to declines of approximately 15% to 46%. Traders are watching these levels to assess whether PEPE will continue its upward trajectory or face further corrections. Conclusion SHIB and PEPE have seen impressive gains, but XYZVerse (XYZ) aims to outshine them by uniting sports fans in a community-driven memecoin targeting 20,000% growth.

Why Traders Are Pivoting to Lightchain AI Cardano and Solana have been key players in the blockchain space, but recent slowdowns have pushed traders to seek new opportunities. Cardano's focus on decentralized apps and scalability, alongside Solana’s emphasis on speed and low-cost transactions, hasn’t been enough to sustain momentum.

Enter Lightchain AI (LCAI), a platform that seamlessly integrates blockchain with advanced AI tools, delivering unmatched utility and innovation. This unique focus on AI positions LCAI for exponential growth, making it an attractive choice for traders seeking future-proof investments. Analysts Predict 33,000% ROI for Lightchain AI Experts believe that Lightchain AI’s current price and innovative features position it for a historic bull run, surpassing even the gains seen by early ADA and SOL investors. Key Growth Drivers Adoption Across Industries With use cases in finance, healthcare, and logistics, Lightchain AI has the potential to disrupt multiple sectors. Deflationary Tokenomics By reducing token supply over time, LCAI ensures long-term value appreciation for holders. Upcoming Milestones The launch of its testnet and mainnet in 2025 is expected to significantly boost adoption and token value. Privacy and Security Lightchain AI prioritizes data privacy and security, ensuring AI computations and data handling meet strict privacy standards—essential for fields like healthcare and finance. Community Engagement Lightchain AI fosters collaboration by encouraging contributions from a global developer community, driving ongoing improvements to its AI capabilities. Traders who invest in LCAI at its presale price of $0.003 could see their holdings multiply by 33,000% by 2025, translating into life- changing financial gains . Lightchain AI Is the Future of Blockchain and AI As Cardano and Solana traders seek new opportunities, Lightchain AI stands out as a revolutionary project with unparalleled growth potential. With its innovative AI tools, deflationary tokenomics, and real-world applications, LCAI is poised to dominate the blockchain space and deliver unprecedented returns for early investors. Don't miss your chance to be a part of history and join the LCAI community today!

38007509,https://coinpedia.org/?p=396635,1734962798,Ripple CLO Calls for End to 4-Year SEC Battle: XRP To Soar to $3!,"The post Ripple CLO Calls for End to 4-Year SEC Battle: XRP To Soar to $3! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The legal battle between Ripple Labs and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) which began in December 2020 with the arrival of Joe Biden as US president has now continued for 4 long years. Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer (CLO), Stuart Alderoty, is calling for its end and urging the incoming Donald Trump administration to conclude this legal battle. Alderoty’s Request to End the “Lawless Lawsuit” The Ripple lawsuit, which began over accusations of raising $1.3 billion by selling XRP as unregistered securities, marks its fourth anniversary. Meanwhile, Alderoty took to X to demand an end to what he described as a “lawless lawsuit.” On this 4th anniversary of the SEC’s lawless lawsuit against Ripple, Brad, & Chris, we urge the incoming administration to cleanse the lingering stain of Hinman from the agency. There’s much more to do to repair the damage, but let’s start by restoring trust. — Stuart Alderoty (@s_alderoty) December 22, 2024 In July 2023, Judge Analisa Torres ruled that XRP did not violate securities laws, and other judges in the case criticized the SEC for acting “arbitrarily and capriciously,” further damaging its reputation. Alderoty urged the incoming administration to address the confusion caused by former SEC official William “Bill” Hinman, whose statements on crypto regulations have created conflict in the industry. He even believes that with a crypto-friendly SEC chair like Paul Atkins, there’s a chance to rebuild confidence and bring the clarity the industry desperately needs. Progress in Ripple’s Legal Battles Despite the ongoing challenges, Ripple has made significant strides in its legal battles. The SEC is set to file its opening brief by January 15, just before Gary Gensler steps down as SEC Chair. The agency is appealing a previous ruling that favored Ripple, particularly regarding XRP’s distribution and sales. Separately, a class action lawsuit against Ripple, its subsidiary XRP II, and CEO Brad Garlinghouse is nearing resolution. A district court recently ruled in Ripple’s favor, and both parties have agreed to expedite the final judgment. Impact On XRP Price Overall the lawsuit has impacted the XRP price strongly as it plunged from its ATH of $3.38 to $0.15. Amid so many challenges, XRP price has made an almost 500% jump in the past month and now currently sitting at $2.18 . Meanwhile, some analysts suggest that if XRP stays above the 26 EMA, it could attract more buyers, pushing the price to $2.40. Increased transaction volume may confirm a recovery, with the potential for a rise to $2.60 and $3.",POSITIVE,XRP,EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/ripple-clo-calls-for-end-to-4-year-sec-battle-xrp-to-soar-to-3/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Lightchain AI Crypto AI Revolution Will Deliver Massive Gains,"Investors chasing the next big cryptocurrency sensation are now turning their attention to Lightchain AI (LCAI) . Could this be the next Solana (SOL) or Dogecoin (DOGE)? With cutting-edge AI integration and blockchain innovation, LCAI is making waves as a top contender for massive returns. Currently priced at just $0.003 in its presale , it’s an opportunity that’s hard to ignore. Combining groundbreaking tech with incredible growth potential, LCAI is poised for an explosive breakout in the months ahead. Don’t miss the chance to be part of this exciting journey! AI Integration Transforming Blockchain Applications Lightchain AI distinguishes itself from traditional cryptocurrencies by seamlessly integrating artificial intelligence into its blockchain ecosystem. Its Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) enables developers to create intelligent decentralized applications (dApps). Unlike Dogecoin, which thrives on community hype, or Solana, which focuses on speed, LCAI uses AI to power real-world applications in sectors like healthcare, finance, and logistics. This transformative use of AI positions Lightchain AI as a pioneer in addressing blockchain inefficiencies while creating scalable and practical solutions. Tokenomics and Deflationary Model Driving Value The total supply of LCAI tokens is capped at 10 billion, distributed as follows: Presale (40%) 4 billion LCAI tokens are allocated to early supporters during the presale phase to bootstrap adoption and fund development. Staking Rewards (28.5%) 2.85 billion LCAI tokens are reserved to incentivize network validators and participants who contribute to the ecosystem's security and functionality through staking. Liquidity Pool (15%) 1.5 billion LCAI tokens ensure market liquidity, facilitating seamless transactions and minimizing slippage across decentralized exchanges. Marketing and Partnerships (5%) 500 million LCAI tokens are dedicated to promoting the platform, acquiring partnerships, and increasing global awareness of Lightchain AI. Treasury (6.5%) 650 million LCAI tokens are reserved for future development, operational expenses, and community-driven initiatives to ensure ecosystem sustainability. Team Allocation (5%) 500 million LCAI tokens reward the core team and contributors, with vesting schedules to align incentives with the platform's long-term growth. Deflationary Mechanisms To manage supply and promote scarcity, Lightchain AI employs deflationary mechanisms: Token Burns: A portion of transaction fees and staking rewards are periodically burned, reducing the total supply over time. How Lightchain AI Compares to Solana and Dogecoin Lightchain AI combines the best features of Solana and Dogecoin while addressing their limitations. Solana is known for its speed, but Lightchain AI goes further by offering unparalleled functionality with AI-driven decentralized applications (dApps). While Dogecoin remains a community favorite, it lacks significant real-world utility, which Lightchain AI provides. Additionally, LCAI is quickly gaining traction among developers and enterprises, fostering a balanced ecosystem of innovation and community engagement. With its unique Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus, Lightchain AI ensures energy efficiency and scalability, effectively solving the challenges faced by other networks. Upcoming Milestones Boosting Investor Confidence The Lightchain AI roadmap outlines exciting milestones that highlight its potential in the blockchain and AI space. A major highlight is the long-awaited Mainnet Launch in early 2025, introducing the Advanced Intelligent Virtual Machine (AIVM) to drive global adoption of blockchain-based AI solutions. Another key milestone is Cross-Chain Integration, ensuring seamless compatibility with Ethereum and other major blockchain platforms, enhancing accessibility and interoperability. The team is also pursuing Strategic Partnerships with industry leaders to expand real-world applications in sectors like finance, healthcare, and logistics. These developments meet the growing demand for AI-driven blockchain solutions, positioning Lightchain AI (LCAI) as a leader in this rapidly evolving industry. With a focus on innovation, collaboration, and accessibility, Lightchain AI is poised for exponential growth. Why Lightchain AI Is the Smart Investor’s Choice Investors searching for the next Solana or Dogecoin need look no further than Lightchain AI . Its unique fusion of AI and blockchain offers a broader range of applications, making it a more sustainable and impactful investment. Whether you’re aiming for short-term gains or long-term value, LCAI delivers an unmatched opportunity to capitalize on the next wave of blockchain innovation.

38007470,https://crypto.news/?p=14321593,1734962690,Christmas lull? Major cryptos down as investors appear to be taking profits,"Despite being just a day away from Christmas Eve, the crypto market shows no signs of recovery, as Bitcoin, the flagship crypto asset, has failed to stay above $100,000. Crypto prices continue to show a lackluster response from investors despite approaching Christmas Eve—a period that has historically seen most crypto assets rally, reaching new all-time highs and contributing to the festive mood. Bitcoin ( BTC ), which reached a new all-time high of over $108,000 just six days ago, has struggled to reclaim the $100K mark for the past three days. The flagship cryptocurrency has been down 8.3% over the past week, trading at $95,904 per coin. Other high-cap coins were also observed in a similarly subdued state. Ethereum ( ETH ) has fallen by 15.6% over the past 7 days, currently trading at $3,339. Meanwhile, XRP , linked to Ripple, has also experienced a notable 7.8% decline during the same period, now trading at $2.2. Meanwhile, the leading meme coin by market cap, Dogecoin ( DOGE ), has plummeted by over 21% in the past week, with its price currently hovering around $0.316. Additionally, Solana ( SOL ) has fallen below the $200 mark, tanking by 16% to a current price of $184. The weekly crypto charts of other leading crypto assets are also awash in red, with the broader market still down 14% from its all-time high of $3.9 trillion, currently standing at $3.41 trillion, according to data from CoinGecko. Looking at these charts, it seems investors have chosen to take early profits from their investments ahead of Christmas Eve. You might also like: Bitcoin price is still undervalued, MVRV indicator shows Despite a significant sell-off over the past week, the crypto market might not be done surprising investors just yet. Historically, a post-Christmas rally, often dubbed the ‘Santa Claus rally,’ has brought festive cheer to traders. According to a CoinGecko report , this rally, which typically unfolds between Dec. 27 and Jan. 2, has occurred 8 out of 10 times over the past decade, from 2014 to 2023. During these periods, the overall crypto market cap recorded gains ranging from 0.69% to 11.87%—offering a glimmer of hope amid the recent market downturn. However, this time around, the chances of a post-Christmas rally hinge largely on Bitcoin, which is currently dictating the market’s direction. The downturn over the past week was driven primarily by BTC’s drop below the $100,000 mark , and as such, if the flagship crypto manages to reclaim that level this week, it could reignite investor confidence and set the stage for a broader market rebound. As previously reported by crypto.news, Bitcoin remains undervalued according to the MVRV-Z score, which currently sits below historical thresholds associated with overvaluation. This leaves room for recovery in the coming weeks. Market pundits have repeatedly pointed out that corrections are normal during prolonged Bitcoin rallies. Meanwhile, experts from VanEck speculate that Bitcoin will re-enter its price discovery phase following the recent correction and expect BTC to hit as high as $180,000 by Q1 2025. At press time, Bitcoin was down 1.1% in the past 24 hours, exchanging hands at $95,870 per coin.

Total assets under management for digital asset exchange-traded products fell by $17.7 billion, representing a 0.37% decline in assets under management, marking the 13th largest single-day outflow on record, said CoinShares head of research James Butterfill.

Multi-asset investment products faced the steepest losses, with $121 million in outflows. However, selective interest in altcoins persisted, with XRP ($8.8 million), Horizen ($4.8 million), and Polkadot ($1.9 million) showing positive inflows. The outflows come as Bitcoin struggles staying above the $100,000 mark, falling in a moment below $95,000. According to CoinGlass, Bitcoin’s descent triggered a $1.4 billion mass liquidation event, wiping out leveraged long positions within 24 hours.

Their new target? A hidden altcoin currently in its presale phase , projected to surge by 5,409% by January 2025. With such significant whale movements, the crypto community is eager to uncover what makes this altcoin so appealing. Let’s delve into the factors driving this shift and why it could signal a massive opportunity for savvy investors. Why Solana Whales Are Selling PNUT and CHILLGUY PNUT and CHILLGUY gained early traction among Solana investors due to their memetic appeal and speculative potential. However, their growth has stalled in recent months, leaving large holders searching for more promising opportunities. PNUT's DeclinePNUT experienced rapid growth in its early days but failed to sustain its momentum due to a lack of real-world utility and dwindling community engagement. CHILLGUY's PlateauSimilarly, CHILLGUY saw initial hype as a niche memecoin but has struggled to expand beyond its core audience, limiting its long-term appeal. Faced with these challenges, whales are pivoting toward a project with substantial growth potential, cutting-edge technology, and a robust roadmap. The Hidden Altcoin Gaining Whale Attention Innovative Consensus Mechanism Lightchain AI introduces the Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus, rewarding nodes for executing AI computations like model training and optimization. This approach enhances network security and efficiency, setting it apart from traditional mechanisms. Comprehensive Roadmap Lightchain AI's roadmap outlines a clear path to growth, with milestones such as the testnet launch in January 2025 and the mainnet activation in March 2025. This structured plan demonstrates a commitment to innovation and scalability. Robust Tokenomics The LCAI token has a total supply of 10 billion, allocated as follows 40% for presale, 28.5% for staking rewards, 15% for liquidity, 5% for marketing, 6.5% for the treasury, and 5% for the team. This distribution ensures sustainability and equitable participation within the ecosystem. Strategic Vision By integrating AI with blockchain technology, Lightchain AI addresses challenges in scalability, governance, and privacy, positioning itself as a leader in decentralized intelligence. Its focus on real-world applications across various industries underscores its potential for widespread adoption. These factors, coupled with LCAI's low presale price and strong development team, make it a compelling investment opportunity in the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency space. Why This Altcoin Is Expected to Surge 5,409% Analysts are optimistic about LCAI’s growth potential due to its unique approach and favorable market conditions. Early Market PositioningLCAI’s presale phase offers a ground-floor opportunity for investors to participate in a project poised for exponential growth. Rising Demand for AI SolutionsAs artificial intelligence continues to transform industries, LCAI’s focus on AI-powered blockchain applications sets it apart from competitors. Strategic Roadmap ExecutionWith a well-defined roadmap, including a testnet launch in early 2024 and a mainnet rollout by 2025, LCAI is on track to deliver on its promises. These factors contribute to the projected 5,409% price increase, making it an attractive option for both retail and institutional investors. What This Whale Activity Means for the Crypto Market Whale movements often serve as a barometer for broader market trends. Their transition from PNUT and CHILLGUY to Lightchain AI signals a shift in investor priorities, favoring utility-driven projects over speculative memecoins. This shift could indicate a maturing market, with investors looking for sustainable and innovative solutions rather than short-term gains. As more whales and retail investors flock to projects like LCAI, the crypto space may see increased stability and long-term growth potential. Also, as whales continue to offload PNUT and CHILLGUY, their value may drop significantly, presenting buying opportunities for those interested in these tokens. However, thorough research is essential before investing in any cryptocurrency. Rare Opportunity for Early Investors With the presale phase of Lightchain AI currently ongoing , early investors have a unique opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a project with massive growth potential. As whales continue to shift their focus towards this hidden altcoin, its value is expected to increase significantly over the next few years. Moreover, the limited supply of LCAI tokens and strategic tokenomics make it a rare opportunity for those looking to invest in an emerging cryptocurrency with strong fundamentals. However, as with any investment, there are always risks involved, and it is crucial to do thorough research before making any financial decisions. Plus, as LCAI's use cases expand and its technology gains mainstream adoption, its value is likely to increase even further, providing early investors with a substantial return on their investment. So keep an eye out for this hidden altcoin and consider the potential it holds for your crypto portfolio. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Ripple’s XRP has made a good case – a bullish outlook has intensified amid institutional interest and legal triumph. SUI has been enjoying a rapid rise from its DeFi approach and partnerships. Another crypto that could make the perfect case is the new crypto casino Rollblock , which has been turning heads with its presale buzz and innovative GambleFi features. Could Rollblock emerge as the dark horse of this bull run? Let’s find out. Rollblock: GambleFi solution, utility-driven allure, huge potential Rollblock is reshaping GambleFi, setting a new benchmark for innovation in 2024. By integrating global sports betting and over 7,000 casino games on the blockchain, it has eliminated the inefficiencies plaguing online gambling for decades. Players can now enjoy seamless gaming experiences free from traditional casino pitfalls. “Out with the old and in with the new.” This new crypto casino is bringing a new age of AI-backed democratized gambling. Punters can earn fairly and enjoy more scaled gaming. At the heart of this is the RBLK native token, which offers even more appeal. Through its revenue share model, this new crypto offers holders 30% of its revenue. This smart tokenomics strategy has positioned Rollblock as the leading crypto to buy now, and it’s paid off. Rollblock has had over 25,000 investors snap up $7.5m worth of RBLK in presale and the price is still a fraction of a cent: $0.043.

That’s the question many investors are asking right now. In August, XRP’s case was nearing resolution after a pivotal ruling against the SEC. However, Trump’s pro-crypto win has fueled speculations that Ripple’s four-year ordeal will end soon. The result was a 450% surge, but that’s not all. XRP is getting massive institutional interest. In fact, whales poured in over $250m in December amid the increasing likelihood of an XRP ETF. But the appeal has now extended to its recent RLUSD stablecoin launch, potentially marking 2025 as the year of XRP’s dominance. SUI: Ecosystem growth, strategic partnerships and a bright future SUI’s layer one blockchain network has created another compelling narrative for the best crypto to buy. More than a year after its launch, SUI is thriving due to its strategic partnerships and key integrations. Recently, SUI unveiled a partnership with Circle’s Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) to enable seamless USDC transfers across multiple blockchains. Sui’s collaboration with Arkham to improve on-chain data analysis has further bolstered sentiment. As a result, analysts are increasingly bullish on its price trajectory. In fact, renowned analyst Joshua Orhue predicted a long-term surge to $1 by Q1 2025 and optimistic targets reaching $25 by next year’s end. Conclusion The bull run is gaining momentum, and Rollblock has emerged as the standout contender alongside XRP and SUI. The established duo is thriving on their ecosystem strides and institutional growth. Rollblock, too, has excelled with its GambleFi solution attracting whales.

While broader market corrections have weighed down short-term sentiment, Solana’s ability to maintain its structural integrity amidst the downturn provides a glimmer of hope for bulls. If SOL can sustain its current levels and build momentum, it may soon recover lost ground and chart a path toward new highs. Analysts closely watch how Solana responds to this crucial technical signal, as it could define the altcoin’s trajectory in the coming weeks. Solana Holding A Bullish Structure Despite a 30% retrace from its all-time high, Solana (SOL) maintains a bullish structure on higher timeframes, signaling long-term strength. This resilience has analysts and investors optimistic about Solana’s potential to outperform once the market regains momentum. Known for its strong fundamentals and rapid adoption, SOL remains a favorite among traders who are anticipating the next altcoin rally. Top crypto analyst Carl Runefelt recently shared a detailed technical analysis on X, highlighting an encouraging pattern for Solana. Runefelt revealed that SOL has successfully retested a massive triangle formation on the weekly timeframe, a critical milestone for its bullish trajectory.

With advanced AI models, AURA evaluates blockchain activities, such as transaction patterns and app usage, and uses them to deliver custom-tailored actions. For example, the tool can recognize and recommend relevant services to frequent decentralized exchange ( DEX ) traders or guide the bridging funds to new blockchains, fostering a seamless user experience. An AI agent for digital advertising AURA operates unlike traditional targeting models. As an AI agent, it aligns the user’s and ecosystem’s interests to reward value-driven suggestions and promote a fair attention economy. In the spirit of seamless experience, AURA embeds personalized recommendations directly into Web3 platforms like wallets, dApps, and blockchain explorers. For example, AURA can dynamically organize app catalogs for crypto wallets, leverage transaction history for context-aware suggestions on swap and bridge pages, and analyze transaction patterns to recommend the next steps for blockchain explorers. The new approach aims to boost audience engagement while upholding trust and transparency. AURA’s ecosystem runs on the native ADX token, which marketers and developers can stake to enhance recommendation placement or streamline placement approvals. The native token’s synergy with AURA is designed to contribute to the platform’s overall trust and transparency. The goal of AURA Ivo Georgiev, the CEO of AdEx, shared his vision of the project: “AdEx AURA represents a significant step forward for Web3 engagement. It’s not just about analyzing on-chain activity—it’s about delivering smarter, more personalized interactions that benefit everyone in the ecosystem.” Finally, AURA represents the first of several new projects of the company, and AdEx has invited crypto platforms to explore and benefit from the tool.

This rising momentum in its presale has made a confident cryptocurrency expert predict that RXS will pump as Ethereum and Ripple did in 2021. ETH and XRP: Lessons From the Past Rising from $8 to $1,441, Ethereum (ETH) saw an impressive 17,971% increase in 2017. Following suit, Ripple (XRP) shot 2,561% to land $3.36 in the same year. Early investors were paid life-changing profits from these altcoins, and analysts think Rexas Finance will follow a similar path. With a current price of $0.15 as of writing at the 10th presale stage and a target price of $40.5 in 2025, RXS presents an unmatched prospect for investors. Rexas Finance (RXS) Presale: A Phenomenal Start The Rexas Finance presale commenced in September 2024 at just $0.03 during its first stage. Since then, the token has surged by 400%, reaching $0.15 at stage 10. With over 355,271,227 tokens sold, the presale has already raised an impressive $29,416,026, and stage 10 is now 93.35% filled. Investors who act quickly can still purchase RXS at this discounted rate before the final stage, priced at $0.175, begins. The token’s launch on three out of the top ten tier-1 exchanges at $0.20 in early 2025 promises further upside potential. The Driving Forces Behind Rexas Finance 1. Community-Centric Approach: Unlike many projects that rely on venture capital, Rexas Finance has adopted a grassroots strategy, building a dedicated community of individual investors who align with its mission. This approach has created a strong and loyal base, driving organic growth. 2. Certik Audit and Transparency: Leading blockchain security company Certik Audit and Transparency has certified Rexas Finance, therefore guaranteeing the integrity of the project and increasing investor confidence. Moreover, its appearance on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko offers open data and real-time tracking. 3. Real-World Asset Tokenization: Rexas Finance tokenizes actual assets, including real estate, gold, and artwork, transforming asset ownership. The potential is unbounded, given the estimated $121.2 trillion in gold and $ 379.7 trillion worldwide real estate market. With just a click, investors can purchase, sell, or fractionally own these assets, closing the distance between blockchain and conventional markets. 4. Token Builder and Launchpad: The platform lets consumers tokenize assets without writing code and offers a launchpad to gather money for their tokens. Rexas Finance is a flexible and strong ecosystem supporting different platforms like ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155. Attracting notable interest, Rexas Finance is sponsoring a $1 million RXS campaign. With 560,886 entries as of writing, 20 winners will get RXS tokens valued at $50,000 each. By finishing assignments on the Rexas Finance website, participants increase their chances of winning. Having one billion tokens overall, RXS is positioned to take a sizable chunk of the trillion-dollar real-world asset market. Rising from its presale price by 27,000%, analysts estimate the token's price to reach $40.5 by 2025. The utility of the coin, together with its strategic alliances and creative platform, makes this expansion realistic. Why Investors Should Act Now There is just one stage left after stage 10 is filled, and the RXS presale is accelerating quickly. The price will grow to $0.175 in stage 11 before debuting at $0.20 as stage 10 approaches completion. Early investors have already made significant gains; the chance to purchase at presale prices is soon closing. Moreover, the forthcoming release on three of the top 10 tier-1 exchanges will offer liquidity and visibility, creating conditions for exponential expansion. Rexas Finance's emphasis on practical uses guarantees that it is not only another speculative token but an enterprise with actual worth and long-term possibilities. Rising as a leader in the cryptocurrency space, Rexas Finance allows investors to participate in a ground-breaking initiative. RXS is positioned to repeat Ethereum and Ripple's historic success with its community-driven approach, strong ecosystem, and practical value.

At this point, while it is wondered whether ADA will continue its rally, popular analyst Ali Martinez said that there is $6 for Cardano. At this point, the analyst noted that ADA is similar to the cycle in 2020, saying that he believes ADA could surpass its $3.09 ATH in 2021 and reach a new high of $6. 2025 Will Be the Year of Cardano (ADA)! In addition, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson claimed that Cardano has similarities with XRP and Bitcoin. Speaking during a live broadcast, Hoskinson stated that Bitcoin, Cardano and XRP have a bright future, saying that the networks are strong and have overcome many obstacles and difficulties. “XRP, Cardano and Bitcoin have a bright future.” Stating that Bitcoin, Cardano and XRP have overcome obstacles and difficulties, Hoskinson emphasized that untested projects often collapse when faced with obstacles, and said that the best examples of this are Terra (LUNA) and FTX. Charles Hoskinson also noted that Cardano could have more partnership opportunities than ever in 2025. Hoskinson particularly highlighted the network’s recent partnership with Bitcoin smart contract and interoperability solution provider BitcoinOS. Finally, Hoskinson emphasized that the network is determined to reveal itself in 2025 and added that Cardano will participate in leading crypto conferences such as Bitcoin 2025, Token 2049, Paris Blockchain Week and Consensus 2025. “Cardano will move forward loud and proud in 2025.” *This is not investment advice.

Viral ETH Alternative Below $1 Could Be Your Second Shot","Those who bought ETH in the early years, when it was less than $1, saw incredible gains as the token surged to an all-time high of $4,800 in November 2021. Rising to become the foundation of distributed apps and smart contracts, Ethereum transformed blockchain technology. But as ETH today trades well beyond reach for most early-stage investors at $4,068, the hunt for the next Ethereum is more urgent than it has been. Rexas Finance (RXS) is one rising competitor making headlines, a prospective new initiative still underpriced at less than $1 with significant development potential. The Ethereum Journey: From Pennies to Thousands The explosive ascent of Ethereum offers a model for how revolutionary blockchain ventures may produce rewards that change lives. ETH allowed early adopters to purchase into a revolutionary platform meant to distribute money and enable the development of smart contracts. By accumulating developer support and controlling distributed finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), Ethereum became a clear leader in the market. Early investors had witnessed unbelievable returns—gains of more than 1,000,000%—by the time ETH peaked at $4,800. For many latecomers, in the meantime, the chance to buy in Ethereum at such cheap levels is now only a dream. The crypto market has evolved to include fresh initiatives that can mimic Ethereum's success for individuals looking for such returns. Rexas Finance (RXS): The Viral Ethereum Alternative One project that stands out and is ready to replicate Ethereum's early-stage success is Rexas Finance . Both seasoned and novice investors are drawn to RXS because of its presale price of just $0.15 and predicted growth driven by a strong use case. The platform tokenizes real-world assets (RWAs) and lets users exchange genuine objects such as intellectual property, fine art, and real estate. By closing the distance between conventional banking and blockchain technologies, this invention creates unprecedented liquidity and access to assets accessible to high-net-worth individuals. Rexas Finance portrays itself as a scalable and sensible solution that tackles real-world issues, including asset illiquidity, high transaction costs, and a lack of openness in conventional markets. Early on, its utility-driven approach was compared to Ethereum; investors saw it as the next major prospect. The popularity of Rexas Finance's continuous presale has only accentuated its increasing standing. Having raised $29,407,303 as of writing over its first ten presale events, RXS has already shown excellent market confidence and demand. Priced at $0.15 in its presale stage 10, the cryptocurrency appeals to investors looking for exponential gains. Rexas Finance's obvious and convincing use case distinguishes it. Unlike speculative coins, RXS has a strong basis for solving real-world finance and asset management issues. Analysts already project a listing price of $0.20 for those purchasing in the presale, a 33% rise. Furthermore, given that early investors have already witnessed a 400% return from the first presale level, RXS's path seems bright. Can RXS Deliver Ethereum-Level Gains? Ethereum's supremacy grew in its capacity to close a market gap by offering a venue for distributed applications. In a similarly fast-expanding industry, Rexas Finance is carving out a position in tokenized assets. By 2030, experts estimate the worldwide tokenized asset market might reach $16 trillion; therefore, RXS is positioned to take a sizable chunk of this expanding sector. The RXS coin's unique value proposition and appeal to institutional and retail investors make it a strong competitor for large profits. Some analysts believe that if its ecosystem expands and acceptance rises, RXS might eventually yield Ethereum-level returns. The project's focus on accessibility and creativity reflects Ethereum's early goals, enhancing its legitimacy as a deserving substitute. Conclusion Rexas Finance presents an interesting chance for individuals who missed Ethereum's ascent from obscurity to supremacy to participate on the ground floor of a blockchain initiative. With a presale price of less than $1 and an increasing group of investors, RXS is looking to be a major contender for notable long-term development. Although the cryptocurrency market is still unpredictable, Rexas Finance's creative approach, proven presale success, and strong road map excite anyone looking for the next great opportunity. As Ethereum's past demonstrates, early investment in the correct initiative may produce transforming results. RXS might simply be the second shot investors have been waiting for.

Solana is also continuing its downward trend after the increased pressure on financial markets due to a pessimistic statement made by the chair of the US Federal Reserve. Meanwhile, Rollblock is attracting massive capital inflows with 30,000+ daily active users on its DeFi iGambling platform. Can Rollblock outshine XRP and SOL in early 2025? Rollblock: Players turn into investors with DeFi iGambling platform Rollblock’s viral iGambling platform has already delivered returns of 330% to early investors, making analysts even more bullish on the token until the end of this cycle. Rollblock’s GameFi ecosystem is rooted in a unique idea to bring decentralized governance to online gambling platforms. With Ethereum-backed security and a blockchain-powered ecosystem, Rollblock is ready to disrupt the $500 billion per annum global gambling market in 2025. During its explosive presale phase, Rollblock has gained the trust of more than 30,000 daily active users. This bullish momentum is all thanks to Rollblock’s dual appeal as a gaming platform and investment opportunity. Traders can purchase RBLK for a low price of $0.043 and gain exclusive access to Rollblock’s GameFi ecosystem which has 7,000+ AI-powered games. Every financial transaction made on Rollblock is executed via a smart contract that has already passed a comprehensive SolidProof audit. All bets placed on Rollblock are automatically encrypted on Ethereum’s blockchain, making them completely unchangeable. In-game payouts on Rollblock are made through the platform’s native RBLK token which functions as an independent utility altcoin. If traders add RBLK to their staking pool, they can earn weekly staking rewards. The platform also shares up to 30% of its weekly revenue with long-term token holders through rewards, giving RBLK investors the chance to earn a passive income. Rollblock investors benefit from both gameplay and staking rewards, creating a new league of player-investors who are expected to reap a total of 880% gains before the end of RBLK’s presale.

Solana is currently trading for $183.67 after an intraday decrease of 3.70%. According to the SOL/USDT 4-hour chart, Solana is in bearish territory as the token trades below all of its Exponential Moving Averages.

Over four years later, MicroStrategy 's Bitcoin acquisition strategy continues to be a polarizing subject within the crypto space and broader financial circles. Questions linger over how the company's debt-backed Bitcoin purchases affect its health and whether they also pose a risk to the digital asset itself.Debates around these questions have reached a fever pitch in recent weeks as the firm has ramped up purchases and unveiled plans to raise an additional $42 billion to buy Bitcoin in the next three years. In the latest instance, fears expressed by core contributors to leading crypto accelerator Alliance suggesting that the firm's liquidation price may not be so far off and that such an event could lead to an outcome 100 times worse than Terra and FTX have surfaced. However, a key consideration appears to be missing from their analysis.MicroStrategy Liquidation Price Around $60K?Fears expressed by Alliance core contributors Imran Khan and Qiao Wang about MicroStrategy's Bitcoin acquisition strategy in a November 27 episode of their Good Game podcast have recently made the rounds online, thanks to reporting from Wu Blockchain .https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1870755170872909971During the podcast, Wang asserted that Bitcoin could trigger a black swan event 100 times worse than Terra and FTX combined if it fell below the $60,000 price range, which he estimated to be MicroStrategy's liquidation price for its now over 439,000 BTC worth over $42 billion purchased at an average price of $58,219 and backed by about $7.6 billion in loans.For context, Terra and FTX are widely recognized as the two major collapses of the 2022 bear market. Bitcoin dropped as much as 30% at the peak of the Terra collapse chaos, from highs of around $36,124 to lows of $25,401. Also, during the FTX collapse, the asset wiped off nearly 37% in value, dropping from about $21,364 to a low of $15,632. As such, the statements from Wang have sparked significant concern amongst some, especially considering Bitcoin's historical tendency to drop around 70% during bear markets.However, there is one problem with Wang's analysis: MicroStrategy has no forced liquidation price for its Bitcoin holdings.Understanding MicroStrategy's Debt Structure MicroStrategy's Bitcoin holdings are purchased by loans obtained from convertible senior notes instead of traditional loans secured by collateral. Simply put, lenders do not hold any of MicroStrategy's Bitcoin as collateral and do not have the right to seize any assets to force repayment of the loan.Convertible payments only allow lenders to convert their debt to equity stake at an agreed future price before a set deadline or accept cash repayments on the loans if the deadline elapses and the note is not converted. Until conversion, however, lenders receive interest payments on their notes.In the case of MicroStrategy, most of its outstanding notes have maturation dates far into the future, between 2027 and 2029, at very low interest rates.In this structure, there is no set price for MicroStrategy to be required to sell its Bitcoin to cover loans, though the firm could consider doing so in an unforeseen case of a cascade of redemptions in a market panic or cash crunch. Redemptions happen when lenders decide to accept repayment in cash instead of equity in a sign that they lack confidence in the company's future potential or when the company fails to hit the share price target at the maturation of the note.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/23/alliance-partners-reveal-60k-as-microstrategy-bitcoin-liquidation-price-but-theres-a-catch/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=alliance-partners-reveal-60k-as-microstrategy-bitcoin-liquidation-price-but-theres-a-catch,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

This guide focuses on four pivotal projects, each known for its unique attributes and substantial growth potential. These cryptocurrencies are pioneering the future of blockchain with innovative solutions and substantial utility. Here’s a comprehensive review of why BlockDAG, Toncoin, Aptos, and Avalanche are at the forefront of the 2025 market and merit inclusion in your crypto portfolio. 1. BlockDAG: Enhancing Blockchain Capability BlockDAG (BDAG) is transforming blockchain functionality by integrating Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology with a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus model. This innovative approach solves traditional scalability issues, attracting developers and users alike. In its 26th batch, BlockDAG has amassed over $171.5 million, with coins now valued at $0.0234 each. Those who got in early have seen a substantial 2240% increase in value, demonstrating the high demand for this groundbreaking project. Looking ahead to early 2025, BlockDAG is set to launch its mainnet, promising quicker and more decentralized transactions. The project also offers up to 170% extra coins as a bonus for early supporters. Market analysts anticipate that BDAG could reach $1 by the end of 2025, with the potential to climb to $20 or more by 2027. These forecasts place BlockDAG as a leader among the top crypto projects, thanks to its technological innovation and strong market momentum. 2. Toncoin: Expanding Its Ecosystem and Functionality Toncoin is making strides within The Open Network, bolstered by its integration with the Telegram ecosystem. Currently priced at $6.15 with a recent 7% increase, Toncoin is demonstrating a robust recovery. Its expanded utility in payments and smart contracts makes it a versatile pick for blockchain users. The increase in transaction volume and the introduction of new functionalities are boosting demand for TON. Developers are continuously improving The Open Network, enhancing its attractiveness as a platform for decentralized apps. This combination of utility and adoption confirms Toncoin’s place as a top choice among top crypto projects as it heads into 2025 with a growing user base. 3. Aptos: Leading with the Move Programming Language Aptos, born from the Facebook-initiated Diem project, is notable for its innovative Move programming language. With a current price of $10.30, Aptos has witnessed considerable growth in 2024, with its total value locked (TVL) soaring by over 1,800%. This increase is propelled by native USDT liquidity and an expanding decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Leadership transitions in December 2024 have set Aptos up for a new phase of growth under its new CEO, Avery Ching. The platform's scalability and its appeal to developers make it a prime candidate among the top crypto projects to purchase, offering both innovation and a strong foundation for long-term success. 4. Avalanche: Championing Blockchain Efficiency Avalanche is capturing attention with its Avalanche9000 upgrade, which cuts operational costs for Layer-1 blockchains by 99.9%. Trading at $35.01, Avalanche has rallied 167%, approaching its $48 resistance level. Increased investment from major players indicates strong confidence in AVAX’s future. With price targets set above $100, Avalanche continues to be a solid choice among the top crypto projects to buy in 2025, celebrated for its efficient design and expanding ecosystem. Concluding Thoughts The crypto market offers diverse prospects, but success hinges on selecting projects with robust fundamentals and significant growth potential. BlockDAG leads with its state-of-the-art technology, while Toncoin, Aptos, and Avalanche bring powerful features and vibrant ecosystems. These top crypto projects for 2025 are defining the future of blockchain, making them vital for anyone seeking to stay ahead in the crypto industry.

38013762,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=106148,1734960969,"Dogecoin to $4: Expert Says Ongoing Correction is Expected, Sets Timeline for Breakout","A market expert presents a timeline for Dogecoin to break out of the ongoing correction, citing historical data. This comes as the pullback triggers massive declines for the meme coin. For context, Dogecoin previously experienced a rally following the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 5. The election saw pro-crypto candidate Donald Trump secure victory, creating excitement in the crypto community. Dogecoin soared to $0.48 by Dec. 8. However, as the broader market faced corrections, DOGE has dropped 36% in just two weeks. Despite this downturn, analysts believe the correction is part of a healthy market cycle and expect a substantial rebound. Javier Santini, a market analyst and founder of Elemento Cripto, has analyzed Dogecoin's historical patterns and expects an explosive rally soon. DOGE's 1-Month PullbacksAccording to Santini, pullbacks in Dogecoin's price below the previous cycle's all-time high often last about a month before the token resumes its upward momentum. Santini shared Dogecoin's weekly chart, revealing that the asset has consistently followed a unique pattern since 2017. https://twitter.com/javierosantini/status/1870329564875919799Particularly, in January 2014, Dogecoin achieved an all-time high of $0.00232 before entering a correction phase that lasted until March 2017. During this period, the price dropped to as low as $0.00022. After breaking out in March 2017, Dogecoin saw another pullback that lasted for exactly a month before surging to a new all-time high of $0.0187 in January 2018. Following this peak, Dogecoin experienced another extended correction, forming a descending trendline. This trendline broke in December 2020, leading to another rally. However, a pullback that lasted for a month occurred again before Dogecoin skyrocketed to its most recent all-time high of $0.7390 in May 2021. Dogecoin Targets $4 after Breakout The current market behavior suggests a similar cycle may be underway. After breaking out of the latest descending trendline in the fourth quarter of 2024, Dogecoin posted a remarkable 161% rally in November. However, December has brought a correction that Santini believes will also last about a month. He expects Dogecoin to resume its uptrend in the coming week. The analyst sets a price target of $4, expecting it to materialize in a week or less. A rally of this magnitude would require Dogecoin to surge by an impressive 1,168%, considering its current trading price of $0.3253. Santini's optimism comes from the consistent patterns Dogecoin has exhibited since its inception, with each breakout phase leading to new highs. Santini is not alone in his prediction. Another analyst, @Degengambleh, projected that Dogecoin could reach $4.20. The analysis highlighted a 1,000-day accumulation trend that has laid the foundation for a major rally. He noted this pattern when Dogecoin traded for $0.1713 in March 2024.

38006475,https://btc-pulse.com/?p=27820,1734960765,Australia’s ‘Barefoot Investor’ Takes On Crypto Scammers Using His Likeness,"Exposing the Deception: Scott Pape’s Fight Against Crypto Fraud Scott Pape, famously known as the “ Barefoot Investor ,” is fighting an alarming rise in online scams exploiting his identity. Fake Facebook groups have cropped up impersonating Pape to lure victims into fraudulent cryptocurrency investment schemes. With his reputation for promoting financial literacy, these scammers leverage Pape’s credibility to bait unsuspecting individuals. Unmasking WhatsApp Crypto Scams Pape had joined the network to expose how fraudsters operate. He used a pseudonym to infiltrate a sham Facebook group and was invited straight into an “exclusive” WhatsApp community called the “DB Wealth Institute”, where the scammers impersonated financial experts providing victims with fake trading signals. Pape’s question unraveled a thread of deceit. Pre-fabricated press releases about DB Wealth Institute manufactured its legitimacy, even to the extent that it was syndicated to major platforms like Yahoo Finance and Forbes, while in fact this was just an attempt to make it appear credible to prospective victims. A Three-Step Strategy Pape explained that most of these schemes follow a three-step strategy: building confidence, fueling greed, and instilling fear. Victims are enticed with small, quick profits early on, creating a false sense of security. Once trust is established, scammers pressure them into larger investments , often suggesting loans to capitalize on so-called “exclusive opportunities”. Pape described how fraudsters put pressure on him to invest up to $20,000 following the first successful trade. That, he said, was the climax of the scam because the fraudsters disappear once they get good money. Raising Awareness and Taking Action Rather than waiting for the social media sites to do something, Pape took it upon himself, publishing these scams right out front. He shared his experience in view of educating other users on how to spot such scams and not fall prey. As crypto-related scams continue to rise, including the $2.2 billion lost globally in 2024 alone, according to Chainalysis, the actions of Pape serve to remind people of vigilance and informed decision-making. His call for action couldn’t be louder: don’t let greed cloud your judgment and always verify the legitimacy of financial opportunities. In the process, Pape reinforces his mission of protecting ordinary investors against financial pitfalls and cements his position as a voice to be trusted in personal finance.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | SPONSORED | TRADING,,0,0,BTC Pulse,https://btc-pulse.com/australias-barefoot-investor-takes-crypto-scammers/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png

Over the past week, Sun offloaded 39,999 ETH worth $143 million, coinciding with Ethereum’s price plummeting by 17% after being rejected at the $4,000 resistance level. Analysts suggest the market could face further downward pressure, with Ethereum potentially dipping below $3,000 before any signs of recovery emerge. Justin Sun’s Aggressive Ethereum Sell-Off Sun has been on a selling spree , unloading Ethereum during key price rallies since the U.S. election results. Blockchain analytics firm Spot On Chain revealed that the Tron founder redeemed the latest batch of 39,999 ETH from liquid staking platforms Lido Finance and EtherFi, transferring the full amount to HTX. Since mid-November, Sun has sold a total of 108,919 ETH, valued at approximately $400 million, at an average price of $3,674. Interestingly, these deposits frequently occurred during local price peaks, potentially exacerbating Ethereum’s recent price slump. Adding to the market jitters, Sun has another 42,904 ETH worth $139 million currently unstaking from Lido Finance. Market watchers believe these funds could also be funneled into HTX, amplifying selling pressure. Bearish Dip or Bullish Reversal? Ethereum’s price has breached critical support at $3,500 , turning market sentiment bearish. Popular crypto analyst IncomeSharks noted last weekend’s low trading volume, suggesting that immediate sell-offs may not be ideal given the current volatility. The On-Balance Volume (OBV) indicator shows steady buying and selling activity, with recent buyers still in profit. However, this support might not hold, as technical charts indicate room for Ethereum to test the $3,000 mark. Not all outlooks are bearish, though. Prominent analyst “I am Crypto Wolf” pointed to a developing inverse head-and-shoulders (iHS) pattern, which could trigger a bullish breakout by late January. If the pattern holds, Ethereum could target $10,000 by May 2025, though a retest of $3,000 seems likely in the short term.

Tether’s $775 million investment in Rumble shows its commitment to fostering financial freedom and technological independence, while Securitize’s proposal to use the BlackRock-backed BUIDL fund as collateral for the Frax USD stablecoin signals a shift towards more secure and yield-generating stablecoin reserves. Tether Invests $775M in Rumble to Challenge YouTube’s Market Dominance Tether , the issuer of the world’s largest stablecoin by market cap, announced a $775 million investment in Rumble, an alternative video-sharing platform known for its open-content policies. The investment is part of Tether’s broader mission of fostering independence and resilience through strategic collaborations. Tether’s CEO Paolo Ardonio took to X on Dec. 20 to share his thoughts on the landmark investment. ”Tether deeply believes in the fundamental values of freedom of speech and financial freedom,” Ardonio stated, adding that the company’s decision to back Rumble aligns with these principles. Ardonio emphasized that Rumble’s ethos of promoting independence and resilience resonated with Tether's vision. “Our strategic investment in Rumble greatly underscores Tether’s focus on supporting technology and companies that empower humans, delivering independence and resilience to our society,” he explained. The collaboration will extend beyond mere financial backing. According to Ardonio, Tether and Rumble are planning to work together on innovative solutions in advertising, cloud computing, and cryptocurrency payments. Rumble’s alternative platform has gained popularity among users and content creators who prioritize free speech and minimal content restrictions. The infusion of $775 million from Tether provides the company with significant resources to expand its global reach and technological capabilities. The announcement had an immediate impact on Rumble’s market performance. The company’s share price (RUM) surged 51.60% during after-hours trading, reaching $10.90, according to Google Finance data . This dramatic increase suggests investor optimism about Rumble’s growth prospects and its potential to challenge established players like YouTube. The partnership with Tether follows Rumble’s growing interest in cryptocurrency. On Nov. 25, Rumble confirmed plans to add Bitcoin (BTC) to its balance sheet, allocating up to $20 million from its excess cash reserves. The move came after Pavlovski conducted a poll on X, asking his followers if Rumble should invest in Bitcoin. Out of nearly 44,000 responses, an overwhelming 93.9% voted in favor. Implications for the Tech and Crypto Industries Tether’s investment marks a significant milestone for both the cryptocurrency and tech sectors. For Tether, the partnership reflects its strategy of extending its influence beyond the stablecoin market into broader technological ecosystems. By backing Rumble, Tether is not only championing free speech but also paving the way for greater crypto adoption in the digital media industry. For Rumble, the $775 million infusion provides the means to scale its operations, enhance platform features, and attract a larger user base. The collaboration with Tether could lead to groundbreaking advancements in crypto payment solutions, potentially revolutionizing how creators and advertisers transact on the platform. As Rumble gears up to challenge YouTube’s dominance, the stakes are high. YouTube, backed by Google, has long held a monopolistic position in the video-sharing market. However, Rumble’s unique positioning as a platform that prioritizes content freedom and financial independence could attract creators and users seeking alternatives. The partnership with Tether may also enable Rumble to leverage blockchain technology in innovative ways, such as integrating crypto payments for content creators or employing decentralized cloud solutions to enhance platform scalability and security. Securitize Proposes BlackRock-Backed BUIDL Fund as Collateral for Frax USD Stablecoin In related news, Securitize, the brokerage firm behind the tokenized BlackRock US Dollar Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), has submitted a Frax improvement proposal (FIP) to integrate BUIDL as a backing collateral for the Frax USD stablecoin. The proposal, if approved, could mark a significant shift in how stablecoins are collateralized, leveraging tokenized real-world assets ( RWAs ) backed by one of the world’s most trusted financial institutions. The proposal highlights the unique advantages of using BUIDL as a reserve asset for Frax USD: Yield Opportunities: BUIDL invests in United States government securities, offering a stable and secure yield for collateral reserves. Enhanced Liquidity and Transferability: The tokenized structure of BUIDL enables seamless transactions and broader liquidity options for users and platforms. Reduced Counterparty Risk: Backed by BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, BUIDL introduces a level of trust and transparency uncommon in traditional stablecoin collateral assets. According to the proposal, these benefits would provide a more robust and scalable foundation for Frax USD, enhancing its stability and utility in the growing stablecoin market. Despite its potential, the integration of BUIDL as collateral for Frax USD is not a done deal. The Frax community will need to vote on the improvement proposal, a standard process in decentralized governance. If approved, BUIDL would join the reserve assets backing Frax USD, bringing a blend of traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi) to the forefront of stablecoin innovation. The move comes amidst growing adoption of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) as collateral in the stablecoin ecosystem. RWAs like BUIDL offer cost efficiencies, rapid transaction finality, and the potential for high-yield opportunities, making them an attractive alternative to traditional stablecoin reserve assets. BlackRock’s involvement in the crypto space through BUIDL has further legitimized RWAs as a viable option for collateralization. By backing the tokenized fund with short-term US government securities, BUIDL provides unparalleled transparency and security, aligning with the strict requirements of both regulators and DeFi communities. Securitize’s proposal follows closely on the heels of other milestones for BUIDL. Ethena Labs, the developer behind the USDe synthetic dollar, launched a separate BUIDL-backed stablecoin called USDtb in December 2024. Unlike USDe, which relies on a complex delta-neutral trading strategy, USDtb is overcollateralized 1:1 by cash and short-term US government securities in the BUIDL fund. USDtb’s launch was met with significant enthusiasm, accruing $65 million in total value locked (TVL) on its first trading day. This success reflects growing confidence in tokenized assets and their potential to reshape stablecoin markets. BUIDL as a Game-Changer in Collateral Markets BlackRock’s ambitions for BUIDL extend beyond stablecoins. In October 2024, the asset manager began pushing for BUIDL to be used as collateral on major crypto derivatives exchanges. Talks with platforms like Binance, OKX, and Deribit signaled BlackRock’s intent to challenge the dominance of incumbent stablecoin issuers like Tether and Circle in the collateral space. The integration of BUIDL as collateral for derivatives trading could introduce new competition and innovation, providing traders with a stable and secure alternative to existing collateral options. The use of BUIDL as collateral is not limited to Ethena’s USDtb or potential Frax USD applications. As of November 2024, the Elixir Protocol enabled the minting of its deUSD yield-bearing stablecoin on the Curve decentralized exchange, using BUIDL as backing collateral. This integration allows users to exchange deUSD with other stablecoin assets in Curve’s liquidity pools, further expanding the utility and adoption of BUIDL in DeFi ecosystems. If the Frax improvement proposal gains community approval, it could set a new benchmark for stablecoin collateralization by integrating tokenized real-world assets from globally trusted financial institutions. By leveraging BlackRock’s BUIDL fund, Frax USD could offer unparalleled stability, transparency, and liquidity, making it a formidable competitor in the stablecoin market. The proposal also brings attention to a broader trend: the increasing convergence of TradFi and DeFi. As major asset managers like BlackRock continue to explore tokenized assets, the lines between traditional and decentralized finance are blurring, opening new doors for innovation and collaboration.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | USDT,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6693/rumble-gains-775-m-boost-from-tether-to-challenge-you-tube-s-dominance,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

Bitcoin’s volatility; Path to $100K blocked? Bitcoin’s price has been on a rollercoaster ride recently. Just last week, BTC reached a new all-time high, surpassing $108,000 for the first time. This surge was followed by a sharp reversal after the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on Wednesday. Bitcoin’s price plummeted below $100,000 and continued to fall, hitting a low of $92,000 by Friday. Although BTC briefly recovered to $99,000 on Saturday morning, the relief was short-lived, and it settled at $96,000 on Sunday. This recent correction has left Bitcoin’s value down by approximately 12% from its peak of $108,000 on December 17. Despite some brief rallies, the overall trend appears to be bearish, with losses deepening as the market digests the rapid price swings. The cryptocurrency asset hit an intraday low of $93,810 on Monday morning, only to recover slightly to $96,000.

Altcoins struggling in the wake of Bitcoin’s decline Bitcoin’s pullback has had a ripple effect throughout the cryptocurrency market, particularly among altcoins. Many altcoins have experienced steep declines in the past few days, with Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) seeing notable losses. Ethereum failed to hold its ground above $3,500 and has since dropped to around $3,350, marking a 3.5% daily loss. XRP, another major altcoin, saw its price fall from just under $2.4 to $2.21 as the broader market downturn took hold. ETH/USDT price chart.

The broader altcoin market is grappling with losses, and many tokens are struggling to maintain their value. The recent downturn has left the market in a state of uncertainty, with investors uncertain about whether bullish predictions will stand in 2025. Analysts’ predictions: A bearish trend looms Fears of a bearish crypto market phase have been on the rise across the community. Some analysts are predicting that the correction could deepen in the coming months. Michael Pizzino, an Australian crypto analyst, highlighted a potential bearish signal forming in major cryptocurrencies like ETH and SOL, suggesting a possibility of a longer downturn than many had anticipated moving into 2025. “We now have the potential for a macro double top which is a very bearish signal. Now, it’s early days…[but] we shouldn’t ignore the same signal popped up in Bitcoin away from that March top and it did lead to a very lengthy and severe draw down in the market,” he said. However, Pizzino also emphasizes that broader macroeconomic trends for Bitcoin remain positive. While short-term market movements can be volatile and unpredictable, long-term trends for Bitcoin are still largely bullish, with key support levels intact. He cautions against relying too heavily on short-term analysis and suggests that investors remain adaptable, especially in times of market uncertainty. David Lawant, head of research at crypto prime broker FalconX, highlighted the potential for increased volatility as the year draws to a close, citing a “low-liquidity environment.” Lawant also pointed out that December 27 is set to witness the largest crypto options expiry event in history, with nearly $18 billion in BTC and ETH contracts set to expire. Spot Bitcoin ETFs also experienced bearish signals, with a significant outflow that saw the market shed nearly $950 million on Thursday and Friday as market participants reacted to the ongoing downturn.

This surge was driven by a combination of political and market factors that influenced broader crypto market sentiment. These bullish XRP price projections have significantly impacted market sectors, particularly in crypto innovation. Notably, this momentum has fueled interest in the emerging AI token, PropiChain (PCHAIN) , which analysts forecast could deliver an impressive 20,000% ROI by 2025. XRP Price Gains Momentum as Ripple Unveils RLUSD Stablecoin Ripple’s announcement of its USD-backed stablecoin, Ripple USD (RLUSD), has triggered a notable price movement for its native coin, XRP. On the day of the announcement, the XRP price gained 4%, continuing its impressive upward trajectory. Currently, the XRP price is at approximately $2.48, reflecting a significant increase over recent months. This surge can be attributed to various factors, including regulatory clarity and growing institutional interest. Analysts predict that the XRP price could reach between $1.75 and $3.81 in 2025, depending on market conditions and Ripple's ability to navigate ongoing legal challenges with the SEC. Additionally, the RLUSD stablecoin , set to launch on Tuesday, promises to improve Ripple’s ecosystem by facilitating instant cross-border settlements, treasury operations, and decentralized finance integrations. Ripple has emphasized regulatory compliance for RLUSD, backed by US dollar deposits, government bonds, and cash equivalents. The stablecoin will operate on the XRP Ledger and Ethereum blockchain, enabling scalability across ecosystems. PropiChain (PCHAIN): The AI Token Everyone's Talking About While the XRP price recovers from the bearish movement, the PropiChain AI token is redefining the trillion-dollar global real estate industry by integrating cutting-edge technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI), Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), and the blockchain into a seamless decentralized platform. Designed to tackle inefficiencies in property ownership, transaction processes, and valuation systems, PropiChain has emerged as a beacon for innovation in one of the world’s most traditional industries. PropiChain transforms physical real estate into digital assets through NFT tokenization, enabling fractional ownership. Investors can now buy portions of high-value properties and trade their shares freely on the blockchain, eliminating barriers like opaque pricing and exaggerated capital requirements. This revolutionary system democratizes real estate, providing broader access to markets traditionally reserved for high-net-worth individuals. But what truly sets PropiChain apart is its integration of AI. PropiChain’s AI automates complex tasks like market trend analysis, property valuation, and transaction execution. This saves investors time and optimizes strategies by providing predictive insights and minimizing risks. The platform also automates complex processes, such as executing transactions when specific conditions are met. Imagine setting a desired price for a property and having the AI automatically complete the purchase when the price is right. PropiChain goes beyond traditional real estate platforms by integrating the Metaverse, offering immersive virtual tours of listed properties. This feature allows users to explore properties in a 3D environment, eliminating geographical barriers and enhancing the overall experience. Sellers benefit as well, using these virtual tools to present their properties more effectively, reaching a global audience without the need for physical visits. The Propiverse positions PropiChain as a pioneer in the next generation of real estate marketplaces, blending digital innovation with tangible assets. PropiChain’s use of blockchain technology ensures unparalleled security for all transactions. Every property’s history and ownership details are stored in a decentralized ledger called the “Title Contract,” which mitigates risks like fraud and counterparty manipulation. Furthermore, smart contracts automatically handle lease agreements, rental payments, and renewals. These features simplify property management for landlords while ensuring tenants enjoy transparent, hassle-free interactions. To guarantee the security of the assets and the platform, the smart contracts are audited by BlockAudit. PCHAIN AI Token Presale Gains Traction With High ROI Potential With its ongoing presale , the PropiChain AI token is making waves in the cryptocurrency market, which has already garnered over $1.2 million in funding. As the presale progresses, early investors are presented with a unique opportunity to secure their stakes in a platform poised for significant growth. The PCHAIN AI token presale is structured in multiple phases, starting at an enticing price of $0.011 per token in the first round. As the presale progresses, prices will rise to $0.023 in the second round, with a projected exchange listing price of $0.032, offering investors a potential ROI exceeding 1,000%. While the XRP price maintains bullish momentum, the rapid rise of the PCHAIN AI token offers an unparalleled opportunity for investors seeking exceptional returns. With growing interest, especially from CoinMarketCap, PropiChain is primed for a breakout. Don’t miss this chance to invest early in the future of real estate.

In an interview with Yahoo Finance, he speculated about future acquisitions, envisioning purchases of up to $1 billion per day if Bitcoin hits $1 million per coin. Saylor Supports Trump’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve As reported, Saylor has expressed strong support for President-elect Donald Trump’s proposal to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Detailed in his “Digital Assets Framework” policy published Friday, the proposal outlines a roadmap for the United States to foster growth in the digital asset industry, establish clear compliance standards, and ensure defined rights for crypto asset holders and companies. Saylor noted the importance of the U.S. leading the global digital economy through innovation in digital assets. “By establishing a clear taxonomy, a legitimate rights-based framework, and practical compliance obligations, the United States can lead the global digital economy,” he wrote. He added that such measures could unlock trillions of dollars in wealth, empower millions of businesses, and secure the U.S. dollar’s status as the cornerstone of the digital financial system. While Saylor did not specify the size of the reserve, he suggested it could create wealth ranging from $16 to $81 trillion, potentially erasing the U.S. national debt of $36 trillion.

Among the best achievers in this field, PropiChain stands out as a unique project with novel features and tremendous upside potential. This emerging altcoin is gaining traction in the decentralized finance space as it combines safety, utility, and a projected 25,000x return. But what makes PropiChain so special? Let’s find out! Ethereum DeFi: A Booming Sector The Ethereum DeFi sector is still thriving with its decentralized solutions that put conventional systems to the test. This ecosystem has revolutionized the way users handle their wealth, from lending to yield farming, among many others. Due to growing usage and technological improvements, altcoins associated with Ethereum DeFi projects are experiencing a surge. Among these many Ethereum DeFi projects, PropiChain is standing out with its potential 25,000x returns. This is because the project is targeting the $300T real estate market ripe for disruption. PropoChain is revolutionizing property investments by addressing the long standing issues that have plagued this industry. PropiChain: A Safer and Smarter Investment In the rapidly evolving Ethereum DeFi industry, PropiChain stands as a shining example of dependability and expansion potential, with features that not only allay worries in traditional industries but also establish new benchmarks for decentralized finance: Fractional Ownership Revolutionizes Accessibility PropiChain's fractional ownership concept is one of its most notable characteristics. It removes conventional barriers to entry by tokenizing real estate properties, so that investors can own fractions of these assets. This strategy broadens access to wealth accumulation, which is a significant benefit in the cutthroat Ethereum DeFi market. For instance, an investor can invest $500 and own a fraction of a property, reaping proportionate profits, rather than needing to spend $200,000 to buy the entire property. The philosophy of decentralized finance is ideally aligned with this democratization of investing. AI-Driven Investment Insights PropiChain's incorporation of artificial intelligence is another unique element. The platform makes use of AI to give investors access to real-time data and analytics so they can make well-informed decisions. Compared to other Ethereum DeFi initiatives that don't have sophisticated tools for market analysis, this improves the investment experience. PropiChain uses AI to optimize asset management and provide predictive insights, assisting users in maximizing profits while lowering risks. Metaverse Integration: The Future of Finance By allowing users to invest in tokenized real estate, PropiChain also takes advantage of the rapidly growing metaverse trend. This special characteristic gives its tokens unmatched utility by bridging the ownership of digital and real assets. PropiChain's integration guarantees its relevance in both virtual and real-world financial ecosystems as the metaverse emerges as a key component of the global economy. This dual usage increases Its popularity in the rapidly changing Ethereum DeFi market. The Financial Opportunity: A 25,000x Upside PropiChain is currently in the second stage of its presale with each $PCHAIN token priced at $0.011. Early investors have the opportunity to take advantage of this, considering this altcoin has a potential 25,000x growth potential, making it one of the most profitable prospects in the Ethereum DeFi sector. For example, if PropiChain reaches its expected valuation, a $1,000 investment today might increase to an incredible $250,000. For smart investors, this amazing upside, along with its cutting-edge features and safe infrastructure, makes it an appealing option. In addition, PropiChain's legitimacy has been enhanced by a thorough security audit and its listing on CoinMarketCap , which will guarantee visibility and more trading opportunities. Conclusion The Ethereum DeFi market's current rally demonstrates how decentralized finance has the ability to change the global financial scene. PropiChain has become a leader in this expansion, providing ground-breaking solutions like metaverse integration, fractional ownership, and AI-driven insights. With its $0.011 presale token price and a remarkable 25,000x growth forecast, it is not only riding the Ethereum DeFi wave but is also establishing new standards for safety and innovation. Don't pass up the opportunity to join this life-changing journey.

38007948,https://cryptonews.com/?p=321957,1734959970,Bullish Fires CoinDesk Editors Amid Independence Controversy Over Justin Sun Article,"Bullish, the parent company of leading cryptocurrency publication CoinDesk, has abruptly dismissed three senior editors, including Editor-in-Chief Kevin Reynolds, amid growing controversy over editorial independence. Fortune reported on Friday that the layoffs also affected Deputy Editors-in-Chief Nick Baker and Marc Hochstein, and multiple sources familiar with the situation confirmed them. Bullish Fires Three CoinDesk Editors: What’s Going On? The firings follow a contentious incident involving the removal of a CoinDesk article about Tron founder Justin Sun’s $6.2 million purchase and subsequent consumption of a conceptual art piece: a real banana duct-taped to a wall. Controversy at CoinDesk because of an article on @justinsuntron eating a $6.2 million banana. Tensions on the rise, leading to the resignation of the editorial chair. #CoinDesk #JustinSun https://t.co/a5dnKGVCCn — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 19, 2024 The piece, part of the “Comedian” series by artist Maurizio Cattelan, was auctioned by Sotheby’s. The article highlighted Sun’s extravagant stunt and referenced his ongoing legal troubles with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This led to complaints from Sun’s team and alleged pressure from Bullish to remove the piece. It also created tensions about editorial independence, which later became a major concern for the staff, as Bullish’s ownership interfered with CoinDesk’s journalistic integrity. Sources revealed that following Sun’s representatives’ request for the article’s removal, Bullish CEO Tom Farley “ordered” its takedown in early December. The decision bypassed standard retraction protocols, which triggered an internal backlash. This ultimately led to the resignation of Matt Murray, former Editor-in-Chief of The Wall Street Journal, who had been appointed to oversee CoinDesk’s editorial independence post-acquisition. The situation escalated as staff became uneasy about potential conflicts between what they termed as “business interests and editorial freedom.” CoinDesk journalists viewed the takedown as a violation of the publication’s journalistic integrity. One senior staff member described the ousted editors as the “heart of the newsroom.” Staff also mentioned: “Bullish executives now heavily influence editorial and content decisions.” Bullish Controls CoinDesk: What Gave Them Such Power? Bullish acquired CoinDesk from Digital Currency Group for approximately $75 million in late 2023, far less than the $200 million valuation initially anticipated. According to the Fortune report, the acquisition had already raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest at the time, as Bullish, a crypto exchange, competes directly with entities frequently covered by CoinDesk. In a letter addressed to Bullish leadership, which The Block viewed, CoinDesk staffers cited fears that the newsroom had been “fully absorbed” into the parent company, which had compromised its autonomy. Among the claims was a reporter saying that they were also “encouraged to attend weekly ‘Bullish Scrum’ meetings that have little relevance to our journalists.” The letter accused Bullish executives of limiting editorial content and opinion pieces to avoid alienating industry leaders, including major event sponsors such as Tron. CoinDesk’s Consensus conference, a flagship event for the crypto industry, debuted in Hong Kong this year. Tron is listed as a primary sponsor. Sources suggest that Friday’s dismissals were framed as part of a restructuring effort to reduce costs and boost productivity, as stated in an internal email from CoinDesk CEO Sara Stratoberdha. However, newsroom staff remain skeptical, interpreting the layoffs as a direct response to the Sun article’s negative impact. It is worth noting that CoinDesk has gone through multiple layoffs since being acquired by Bullish last year. The departures of Reynolds, Baker, and Hochstein, all respected figures in financial journalism, have left the newsroom in disarray. Hochstein, who strongly upholds CoinDesk’s ethics and standards, was critical in maintaining the outlet’s credibility. His exit, alongside Baker’s and Reynolds’, has exacerbated fears of further editorial interference.

38013761,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=106164,1734959848,Michael Saylor Urges Jeff Bezos to Invest $600M in Bitcoin Instead of Lavish Wedding,"Michael Saylor, chairman of MicroStrategy, has intensified his advocacy for Bitcoin adoption among leading global corporations, now taking it to Amazon boss Jeff Bezos. In a recent post on X, Saylor directly suggested that Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder, should consider Bitcoin a significant investment. Saylor’s recommendation comes as Bezos reportedly prepares for a $600 million wedding celebration. Meanwhile, Saylor urged Bezoz instead to leverage the $600 million sum for Bitcoin acquisition. ""$600M would buy a lot of Bitcoin,"" he said. Reports indicate that Jeff Bezos is set to wed Lauren Sanchez on December 28 in Aspen, Colorado. According to the report, the event will feature extravagant arrangements, including the acquisition of a high-end sushi restaurant with seating for up to 180 guests. Furthermore, multiple luxurious mansions have been rented to host the event’s attendees. However, Bezos has denied reports about the million-dollar celebration, calling the claims ""completely false"" and cautioning against believing everything seen in the media.https://twitter.com/saylor/status/1870855350372749702Amazon Discussing Bitcoin AdoptionMeanwhile, Saylor’s proposal for Bitcoin acquisition coincides with growing momentum among Amazon’s stakeholders to explore Bitcoin adoption. The National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), a U.S.-based think tank, has recently encouraged Amazon to examine Bitcoin’s integration into its financial operations. This initiative will culminate in a shareholder vote during Amazon’s annual meeting in April, where the inclusion of Bitcoin on the company’s balance sheet will be a key agenda item. Saylor Pushes Bitcoin to Microsoft BoardWhile pushing for Bitcoin adoption at Amazon, Saylor has also been actively advocating for other tech giants. On December 1, he made a Bitcoin presentation to Microsoft’s board of directors. Saylor argued that Bitcoin could revolutionize capital preservation and productivity, framing it as essential for the company’s long-term growth.He also highlighted Bitcoin’s capacity to mitigate traditional capital risks, positioning it as a superior form of digital capital.Moreover, Saylor proposed that Bitcoin’s adoption could provide companies like Microsoft with an alternative to traditional financial strategies, such as stock buybacks.By leveraging Bitcoin, he argued, corporations could achieve higher returns, bolster shareholder confidence, and reduce counterparty risks, aligning with global trends of using Bitcoin as a hedge against economic instability.However, Microsoft's shareholders turned down the proposal, recommending against it, citing volatility problems.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | RESEARCH,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/23/michael-saylor-urges-jeff-bezos-to-invest-600m-in-bitcoin-instead-of-lavish-wedding/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=michael-saylor-urges-jeff-bezos-to-invest-600m-in-bitcoin-instead-of-lavish-wedding,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

38007673,https://invezz.com/?p=2400821,1734959544,"South Korea, US team up to craft new strategies against North Korean crypto heists: report","Efforts to counter cryptocurrency thefts allegedly linked to North Korea are gaining momentum as the US and South Korea collaborate to track stolen digital assets and curb malicious activity. According to reports , the partnership aims to develop tools to combat crypto-related crimes tied to North Korean hackers, who have reportedly stolen nearly $1.6 billion worth of crypto this year. This initiative signals an intensifying global crackdown on illicit crypto activities that threaten both economic stability and national security. With South Korea’s science ministry backing the programme through 2026, the collaboration also involves leading institutions and experts to address the escalating cyber threat. Joint strategy to counter crypto thefts The US and South Korea have signed an agreement to create mechanisms to prevent and track crypto thefts linked to North Korea. Although specific technical details remain undisclosed, the collaboration represents a significant step in tackling the growing influence of North Korea-linked hackers in the crypto space. The initiative is supported by South Korea’s Ministry of Science and ICT, with research contributions from prominent organisations like Korea University and the US-based RAND Corporation. These experts are expected to focus on tracking stolen funds, identifying laundering methods, and preventing further attacks. Advanced technologies will be used to examine how illicit funds are converted into cryptocurrencies through methods like ransomware and distributed across global networks. The need for such measures is underscored by data from blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis , which reveals that North Korean hackers account for an increasingly large share of stolen crypto worldwide. This collaboration is aimed at dismantling the infrastructure enabling such cybercrimes, addressing the technical complexity of tracking digital transactions across decentralised networks. US sanctions aim to disrupt North Korea’s crypto laundering networks The United States is also ramping up its efforts to curtail North Korea’s crypto-laundering activities through regulatory measures. The US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control recently imposed sanctions on two individuals and a company based in the United Arab Emirates for their alleged roles in laundering funds obtained through North Korean cybercrimes. According to the Treasury, the two individuals utilised the UAE-based company to convert stolen crypto assets, funnelling the proceeds to North Korea. This marks a critical step in identifying and penalising actors involved in facilitating such schemes. The sanctions highlight a growing recognition among governments of the need to address the financial channels that sustain North Korea’s hacking operations. By targeting enablers in jurisdictions with looser regulatory frameworks, the US aims to disrupt the flow of illicit funds that support North Korea’s broader activities, including nuclear weapons development and missile programmes. These measures are expected to complement the joint efforts with South Korea to tackle the issue on multiple fronts. A long-term vision for enhanced crypto security The collaboration between the US and South Korea reflects a shared commitment to bolstering crypto security on a global scale. By pooling resources and expertise, the two nations aim to establish a framework that can be adapted by other countries facing similar threats. With the initiative set to continue through 2026, its success could pave the way for more international partnerships to address the challenges posed by the growing adoption of cryptocurrencies. As North Korea-linked crypto thefts show no signs of abating, these combined efforts could significantly weaken the networks enabling such crimes. However, given the decentralised and anonymous nature of many blockchain platforms, sustained innovation and cooperation will be essential to staying ahead of cybercriminals. This initiative highlights the need for vigilance in the rapidly evolving crypto landscape, where opportunities for innovation are matched by risks of exploitation. For the US, South Korea, and their allies, the fight against crypto-related crimes linked to North Korea is both a test of resilience and a step towards a more secure digital financial ecosystem.

Bitcoin and Ethereum traders are slowly investing in PropiChain (PCHAIN) in anticipation of high returns next year. PropiChain is a tokenized real estate platform. Its ongoing token presale has progressed to the second stage, where each PCHAIN token is going for $0.011 only. It has managed to attract Bitcoin and Ethereum holders as it raised over $1 million in funding during the presale. Bitcoin Surges Amid Trump’s Strategic Reserve Plans Bitcoin set a new high of $108,135 on December 17. The rally was fueled by President-elect Donald Trump’s statement about creating a U.S. bitcoin strategic reserve . This announcement ignited optimism among Bitcoin and crypto investors. Bitcoin has since retreated to $104,494, marking a 3% slide. Analysts are predicting that BTC will reach $250,000 in H2, and potentially signal the cycle top. However, others are less optimistic. Some investors are already cutting their Bitcoin holdings after a 153% surge in the past year. Former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes predicts that Bitcoin and the crypto market will experience a deeper correction around Trump's inauguration in January. PropiChain’s Value Proposition Attracts Smart Money Investors have tipped PropiChain to be the stand-out cryptocurrency in the full-blown altcoin season in 2025. PCHAIN has already shown investors glimpses of what it can do after raising over $1 million during the presale. The presale has attracted smart money and retail investors. Overall, investors find PropiChain's value proposition appealing. Firstly, PCHAIN is a tokenization real estate platform that gives users access to fractional ownership of high-value properties. Users benefit from the possibility of selling fractions of their portfolios to raise capital. Moreover, retail investors have access to investments traditionally reserved for the rich. Additionally, smart contract automation makes property management efficient and cost-effective. The AI-driven smart contracts ensure that every detail is thoroughly checked before being validated. This removes any room for oversight or human error. The smart contract eliminates the need for intermediaries and several steps. Users enjoy quicker and cheaper real estate transactions. To keep the wheel turning safely, PropiChain's smart contracts have been independently audited by BlockAudit. Additionally, PropiChain wants to make life easier for prospective property buyers using the metaverse. The metaverse offers immersive 3D property tours and staging, making it easier for investors to make informed buying decisions. Furthermore, predictive market analysis provides users with access to AI-driven analysis that helps in investing decisions. This gives the platform's users a competitive edge, allowing them to make smart investment choices that will enable them to see high returns. To keep investors happy, PCHAIN has secured a listing on CoinMarketCap. This has added another layer of trust and credibility. Due to its practical use cases, PCHAIN is tipped to rise 10,000% in 2025. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust Hits 1M ETH Milestone BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) has surpassed 1 million ETH in holdings. This makes the asset manager becoming the second-largest ETF holder after Grayscale. With a current holding of 1.025 million Ethereum, BlackRock’s trust reached this milestone following a series of strategic purchases, including a notable buy in September during a period of sideways market movement. Ethereum is trading at $3,859.61, marking a 1.7% increase amid a market downturn. ETH is charging toward the $4K mark. However, analysts claim that Ethereum can reach a new high if Bitcoin loses its strength, paving the way for an altcoin season. Join PCHAIN's Presale Before the Explosive Rally The window is closing for investors who want to make a fortune by investing in PCHAIN in the second stage of its ongoing presale. Bitcoin and Ethereum OGs are flocking to PCHAIN due to its potential to transform the real estate industry. The project combines blockchain technology, AI, and the metaverse to take real estate investing and management to the next level. Investors are predicting a 10,000% surge by 2025, making PCHAIN the best altcoin to invest in now. Copy trade the smart money now.

The LINK marines appear to be quite confident over the next price action and as a result, the token has maintained a decent ascending trend. Meanwhile, the LINK price remains still above the pivotal range at $20 but a wider correction may soon make a huge room. The volume over the platform has slashed heavily, ranging from over $9.3 billion to the current level of less than a billion, a drop of over 80%. Despite this, the LINK price has maintained a consolidated ascending trend. While the retail traders continue to remain off-shore, the whales have turned active. During the recent pullback, they have managed to accumulate a huge number of LINK tokens. The santiment data shared by analyst ALI suggests the number of wallets holding LINK tokens within the range of 10M and 10M have risen by over a million. This move is speculated to have kept the LINK price stable above $20 throughout the past weekend when the markets experienced a massive plunge. Now that LINK has managed to grab the attention of the whales, will bulls also be attracted to them? Will the LINK price revive and mark a bullish close for the year? The daily chart of Chainlink indicates that the token may soon fall and test the support just above $20. To begin, the DMI levels are moving in tandem, indicating a high likelihood of a bearish crossover, and the Ichimoku cloud also suggests a potential pullback, as the base and conversion lines are also displaying a similar action. Observing the pattern, it suggests that the price may rise to $25 and drop back to $20, which may validate a head & shoulder pattern. If the bulls fail to defend the support, a continued bearish action could drag the levels below $18.

Although such use cases might be gradually phasing out, cryptocurrencies, and Bitcoin ( BTC ) in particular, have a history of being used for illegal purposes. To use the most straightforward example, the BTC confiscated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) from dark-web marketplace Silk Road is now worth billions of dollars . These illegal activities extend beyond common criminality — a lot of the time, they involve state actors whose clandestine activities are quite far-reaching. Efforts like these can include hacking for the purpose of theft, or attempts to avoid international sanctions . However, there is one thing that addresses linked to such groups and purposes rarely do — and that’s trade crypto. Last week, however, a wallet associated with the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s (DPRK) infamous Lazarus Group did just that — and ended up accruing significant losses within a matter of days. Wallet linked to North Korea hacker group makes untimely ETH trade The first transaction was made on December 18, and saw the deposit of 476,489 USD Coin (USDC). On the same day, the account went long on Ethereum ( ETH ) at a price of $3,791, per data retrieved by Finbold from Hypurrscan . Transactions made by the wallet allegedly tied to North Korea. Source: Hypurrscan That proved to be quite a costly mistake —as on December 18, ETH entered into a downward motion that would last until December 20. Just two days after the trade was opened, it was closed — and with ETH prices having receded to $3,251, the original investment, which was worth $2,808,823, was now worth $2,408,869. ETH price weekly chart. Source: Finbold In total, this short-term trade brought about a $399,954 loss for the address in question. Finally, a USDC withdrawal worth $18,197 was made on December 21. Readers should note that the losses could be greater than $399,954 — while the last withdrawal doesn’t necessarily mean that the wallet is completely cleaned out, early liquidation penalties and transaction/platform fees could have taken an additional bite out of its purchasing power.

Although DOGE has risen to $0.4049 and XRP has jumped to $2.49, neither currency can turn a $770 investment into $770,000. That difference belongs to Rexas Finance (RXS), a revolutionary coin with amazing development potential and innovative utility. Rexas Finance (RXS): A Revolutionary Investment Opportunity Rexas Finance (RXS) is rapidly rising as a popular crypto for investors hoping for life-changing rewards. Leading Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization, Rexas Finance closes the gap between conventional assets and blockchain technology. Rexas Finance provides unmatched liquidity and access by letting customers tokenize, trade, and own tangible assets, including real estate, art, commodities, and intellectual property. It has had amazing results during the presale. At $0.15 in its tenth presale stage as of writing, RXS has already raised over $29.44 million by selling out past stages ahead of time. Reflecting great investor interest, the coin has seen a 5x price rise since its first presale stage just over two months ago. Rexas Finance assured short-term gains through a projected listing price of $0.20 and listings on three top-tier exchanges, creating the foundation for an unparalleled price increase. The Power of Holding to Cycle Top Maximizing returns in the crypto market mostly depends on spotting tokens with exponential growth potential and holding them until the cycle's peak. Rexas Finance (RXS) provides precisely such a possibility. Early investors already have a guaranteed return from its projected listing price of $0.20 and current presale price of $0.15. The expected expansion of the RWA market strengthens Rexas Finance's situation even more. RXS is positioned to take the front stage as more businesses embrace tokenization to boost liquidity and efficiency. Experts estimate an amazing 10,000% surge in the token's price during this bull cycle, translating into a possible cost of $15. Given this price spike, a $770 investment now might explode to $770,000 if held until the cycle peak. The token's robust foundations and ambitious road map help justify this development path. The expected listings on three tier-1 exchanges will significantly increase its visibility and liquidity, promoting more usage. Furthermore, the token's Certik-audited structure guarantees high security and openness, which helps investors choose it with faith. Although big coins like XRP and DOGE still take the front stage, their market characteristics make it challenging for them to reach exponential expansion. Although Ripple's recent surge is remarkable, its vast market capitalization limits its capacity for outsized profits. Dogecoin is a fun but less reliable investment because community enthusiasm and meme culture mostly drive its momentum. By comparison, Rexas Finance blends a fast-growing market with a strong use case. Its emphasis on tokenizing real-world assets sets it apart from conventional cryptocurrencies in providing scalability and utility, which are absent from both. This makes it a unique choice for anyone looking for quick profits and long-term wealth building. Now Is the Time to Invest in Rexas Finance (RXS) In the crypto market, timing is everything, and Rexas Finance is currently at the sweet spot for investment. The cryptocurrency is priced at an understandable $0.15 and has great upside potential, as its tenth presale stage is almost over. Once listed on leading exchanges, RXS is predicted to show an initial 100x rally followed by an additional increase as adoption speeds up. Furthermore, the presale of Rexas Finance has already brought in more than $29.44 million, indicating great investor trust. Together with its planned listings and creative RWA strategy, this momentum prepares the ground for a historic price climb. Acting now helps investors to guarantee their place in a token with unmatched profits. Conclusion Rexas Finance (RXS) is the ultimate choice for investors aiming to turn $770 into $770,000 in this bull cycle. While XRP and DOGE have delivered solid gains, their growth potential is limited compared to the explosive opportunity presented by RXS. With its innovative approach to asset tokenization, strong presale performance, and projected 10,000% rally, Rexas Finance is the clear winner for those seeking life-changing returns.

38005645,https://crypto.news/?p=14321407,1734959160,Most Layer 2 solutions are still struggling with scalability and cost challenges | Opinion,"Disclosure: The views and opinions expressed here belong solely to the author and do not represent the views and opinions of crypto.news’ editorial. Since pivoting to a layer 2-centric approach, the Ethereum ( ETH ) ecosystem has relied heavily on L2 solutions to scale. However, these solutions are struggling to compete effectively, especially under pressure from alternatives like Solana ( SOL ). During the recent meme coin craze, Solana attracted much of the activity due to its advantages: low fees, high transaction speed, and user-friendliness. You might also like: Sharding tech makes 100x scalability and seamless interoperability a reality | Opinion To understand the challenges, it’s essential to examine why L2 solutions have not demonstrated the scalability and cost advantages that were widely anticipated. Why meme projects favor Solana over Ethereum L2s Meme projects have significantly contributed to the recent surge in market activity. These projects favor Solana for several reasons beyond user-friendliness: Low fees: Solana’s low transaction costs make it ideal for fee-sensitive applications like memecoins. High speed: Solana’s multithreaded architecture enables high throughput, ensuring seamless user experiences. Better developer experience: Solana’s tools and ecosystem are optimized for ease of use, attracting developers and projects. Why is scalability important? Scalability is fundamentally measured by the number of transactions a blockchain can process. A highly scalable blockchain can handle more TXs while offering lower fees, making it crucial for widespread adoption and maintaining a seamless user experience. This is especially important for grassroots projects like meme coins, many of which are short-lived and highly fee-sensitive. Without scalability, these projects cannot thrive, and users will migrate to platforms that offer better efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Why Ethereum L2s aren’t up to the challenge Architectural limitations of Ethereum. Ethereum has long faced scalability issues, and L2 rollups are its primary solution to these problems. L2s operate as independent blockchains that process transactions off-chain while posting transaction results and proofs back to Ethereum’s mainnet. They inherit Ethereum’s security, making them a promising scaling approach. However, Ethereum’s original design poses inherent challenges. Ethereum’s founder, Vitalik Buterin, has admitted that “Ethereum was never designed for scalability.” One of the key limitations is the lack of multithreading in the Ethereum Virtual Machine. The EVM, which processes transactions, is strictly single-threaded, meaning it can handle only one transaction at a time. In contrast, Solana’s multithreaded architecture allows it to process multiple transactions simultaneously, significantly increasing throughput. L2s inheriting Ethereum’s limitations. Virtually all L2 solutions inherit Ethereum’s single-threaded EVM design, which results in low efficiency. For instance, Arbitrum : With a targeted gas limit of 7 million per second and each coin transfer costing 21,000 gas, Arbitrum can handle about 333 simple transactions per second. More complex smart contract calls consume even more gas, significantly reducing capacity. Optimism : With a gas limit of 5 million per block and a block time of 2 seconds, Optimism can handle only about 119 simple transfers per second. Gas-intensive operations further reduce this capacity. Unstable fees. Another major issue with Ethereum and its L2 solutions is unstable fees during periods of high network activity. For applications relying on low and stable fees, this is a critical drawback. Projects like meme coins are especially fee-sensitive, making Ethereum-based L2s less attractive. Lack of interoperability between L2s. The scalability argument for having multiple L2s only holds if contracts on different L2s can interact freely. However, rollups are essentially independent blockchains, and accessing data from one rollup to another is as challenging as cross-chain communication. This lack of interoperability significantly limits the potential of L2 scalability. What can L2s do to further scale? Embed features to enhance interoperability . Ethereum L1 needs to do more to support interoperability among L2s. For example, the recent ERC-7786 : Cross-Chain Messaging Gateway is a step in the right direction. While it doesn’t fully resolve the interoperability issue, it simplifies communication between L2s and L1, laying the groundwork for further improvements. Architectural updates: Diverge from the existing L1 design . To compete with multithreaded blockchains like Solana, L2s must break free from Ethereum’s single-threaded EVM design and adopt parallel execution. This may require a complete overhaul of the EVM, but the potential scalability gains make it a worthwhile endeavor. Future milestones Ethereum’s L2 solutions face significant challenges in delivering the scalability and cost-effectiveness that applications like meme coins demand. To stay competitive, the ecosystem must address fundamental architectural limitations, enhance interoperability, and embrace innovations in blockchain design. Only by doing so can Ethereum L2s achieve the scalability needed to support widespread adoption and fend off competition from emerging blockchains like Solana.

The Ethereum DeFi ecosystem, known for its transformative impact on traditional finance, continues to attract investors seeking innovative opportunities in decentralized lending, borrowing, and trading. AAVE, one of the most established assets in this space, has emerged as a standout performer, driving enthusiasm for Ethereum-based projects. This surge reflects growing confidence in the potential of DeFi platforms to redefine financial systems, supported by ETH's robust blockchain infrastructure. The remarkable rally of AAVE underscores the broader trend of Ethereum DeFi altcoins pushing upward in value. Analysts project that a rival altcoin, PCHAIN , within the Ethereum DeFi space could potentially double AAVE's gains, attracting significant attention and excitement across the market. As more users explore decentralized finance for its transparency and efficiency, Ethereum DeFi altcoins like AAVE and PCHAIN are solidifying their positions as key innovators. These altcoins are capturing the attention of institutional and retail investors in the evolving crypto landscape. The Ethereum DeFi Growth and AAVE's Remarkable Price Surge Ethereum DeFi altcoins have become synonymous with innovation in the crypto space, and the AAVE is a testament to that effect. The platform, built on the ETH blockchain, enables users to lend and borrow crypto assets without intermediaries. Its unique features, such as flash loans and high-security protocols, have garnered significant attention from the DeFi community. The 110.5% rally marks one of the most impressive performances of AAVE in recent months. Analysts believe this growth is a reflection of the broader recovery of Ethereum DeFi altcoins. With more users engaging in DeFi activities, platforms like AAVE are benefiting from heightened liquidity and user participation. While AAVE is soaring, this rival, PCHAIN, has been tipped by leading analysts to double the gains. Such projection has garnered massive attention from investors and retail traders seeking to capitalize on the opportunity for massive gains. Rival Project Eyeing Bigger Gains Than AAVE While AAVE has demonstrated exceptional growth, the rival project, PCHAIN, within the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem, is positioning to outperform it by at least 221%. PCHAIN is one of the RWA altcoins that has captivated the crypto market with its unique value proposition to disrupt the $600 trillion global real estate market. This rival altcoin is also the utility token of PropiChain, a blockchain-based real estate platform that uses cutting-edge technologies to power the future of multi-trillion-dollar global real estate. According to top market analysts, a series of factors are driving PCHAIN's potential massive gains, such as: Increasing Market Demand The real estate market is projected to make up a larger percentage of the $16 trillion RWA tokenization market. With PCHAIN leading the charge for the tokenization of real estate assets on the blockchain, institutional investors and crypto whales see this asset as the potential game-changer in the global real estate market. Backed by the Number one Asset Class in the world PCHAIN is tied to the $600 trillion real estate market, giving the altcoin a relatively stable performance amid crypto market volatility. This stability attracts massive interest from savvy investors and retail traders who seek low-risk, high-profit investment opportunities in the market. Revolutionary Parent Project PropiChain, PCHAIN's parent project, is set to redefine the global real estate market using new-generation technologies. According to top market analysts, the platform is poised to take at least 1% of the $600 trillion real estate market. This means PCHAIN is potentially the utility token of a $6 trillion ecosystem. PropiChain's New-Generation Technologies to Power the Future of Real Estate PCHAIN's parent project, PropiChain , is transforming the global real estate market by deploying cutting-edge technologies, including AI, the Metaverse, tokenization of Real World Assets (RWA), and smart contracts. With AI-powered virtual assistants and chatbots, PropiChain offers personalized guidance to real estate investors throughout their investment journey. Its advanced predictive AI tools analyze market trends to deliver actionable insights, helping investors identify emerging opportunities and stay ahead of the market. Through the integration of the Metaverse, PropiChain enables real estate investors to explore properties worldwide virtually. This feature eliminates the need for physical site visits and the stress that comes with frequent traveling. It breaks down geographical limitations, offering a more accessible and efficient way to evaluate real estate assets. Another groundbreaking feature of PropiChain is its RWA tokenization technology. By converting real estate assets into blockchain-based digital tokens, the platform facilitates fractional ownership. This innovation allows investors with smaller budgets to acquire portions of high-value properties, making premium real estate investments more accessible. PropiChain's approach democratizes the real estate market, enabling a broader range of participants to engage in lucrative investment opportunities. Furthermore, the platform employs smart contract technology to simplify property management processes. Tasks such as property leasing and lease renewals are automated, reducing reliance on intermediaries and making the management process more efficient and cost-effective. Conclusion With PCHAIN set to outperform the AAVE's 110.5% rally and a host of other Ethereum DeFi altcoins by at least doubling the rally, market experts say that your $1000 investment in the ongoing PCHAIN presale priced at $0.011 could be worth over $132,000 by Q1 of 2025. The project has already raised over $1.3 million from its first presale round, a sign of investor's confidence in the project. Join the presale now to enjoy these potential massive gains. At the end of this presale round, the price of PCHAIN will rise to $0.023 for the third and final presale round. BlockAudit , a leading blockchain security firm, has carried out a thorough audit of the project's smart contract and found zero vulnerabilities. The token is listed on CoinMarketCap , signaling the project's readiness to take the crypto market by storm.

38007672,https://invezz.com/?p=2400820,1734958800,Regret not buying Bitcoin at $10? here are 3 coins fighting for the ‘next BTC’ spot,"Do you regret not buying Bitcoin at $10? You have company. Many claim they missed life-changing profit opportunities as Bitcoin has dramatically transformed from an unknown cryptocurrency into a worldwide legacy. The positive aspect is that the cryptocurrency market is still expanding and offering new opportunities. Rexas Finance (RXS), XRP, and Solana (SOL) are three competitors that are being funded as targets for the “next Bitcoin.” These projects have innovative technology, real-world utility, and exponential growth potential, making them ideal for experienced investors looking to ride the next blockchain wave. Let’s explore why these currencies could be your ticket to the future of money. Rexas Finance (RXS) Beyond decentralized finance, Rexas Finance sources its token within the physical and real-world sectors by tokenizing items like real estate, arts, and other essential properties, enhancing scalability and fractional ownership of assets. Bitcoin is taking the first token position on CoinMarketCap due to its excellent market valuation. Due to its novel crypto investing possibilities, Rexas Finance (RXS) is a promising “next Bitcoin” candidate. Rexas Estate, a pioneering RWA tokenization endeavor, is one of its highlights. Rexas Estate lets users co-own real estate and earn stablecoins while diversifying their crypto investments. This unique solution combines the stability of traditional investments with the growing potential of blockchain technology, appealing to both experienced and new investors. Rexas Finance democratizes wealth-building and hedges against market volatility by allowing fractional ownership of real-world assets, an uncommon characteristic in the crypto ecosystem. Strong community support and targeted development milestones drive acceptance and innovation, distinguishing Rexas Finance. RXS, the platform’s native token, has raised over $26.9 million as of writing, with 89% of the 10th presale round filled. The tremendous reaction shows trust and enthusiasm for the idea. A $1 million giveaway incentivizes early adopters, and the token’s $0.15 price with a $0.20 listing price gives tremendous upside potential. With CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko listings and the likelihood of top-tier exchange listings, RXS will gain visibility and liquidity. Investors trust the platform’s security after Certik’s comprehensive audit. Using cutting-edge functionality, significant financial support, and a committed community, Rexas Finance sees itself as a revolutionary RWA tokenization force and a top “next BTC” candidate. Ripple (XRP) With the pressing of the community on its capacity for possible significant advancements, XRP has positioned itself strongly as the potential third in line after Bitcoin and Ethereum to be dubbed the next successor. An XRP Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) may make XRP a mainstream asset and attract unprecedented institutional participation. Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD, was approved, boosting investor confidence and fueling ambitious price expectations. A renowned XRP fan predicts a jump during the bull market, fueling talk of a massive rise. XRP trades at $2.44 and targets $2.80 resistance, while $1.90 provides support. XRP supporters are on edge if XRP breaks $2.80; analysts say the next stop might be $2.86 and beyond, prompting a price spike. XRP is rapidly becoming a cryptocurrency powerhouse, vying to become the next BTC. Its growing adoption in cross-border payments, strong community backing, and promising regulatory clarity and financial innovation prospects. Solana (SOL) Solana has become a blockchain powerhouse, and its recent success suggests even more. The token has risen 4% in the past month and is currently trading at $226, up 1.2% in 24 hours. This trails behind the overall recovery, but Solana’s ability to hit a new all-time high of $264 this cycle—overcoming its 2021 peak—makes it one of the few cryptocurrencies to do so. This shows its solid foundation and rising popularity. Analysts were stunned when Solana announced its rebounding plans to make its presence felt in the market. Some started predicting the coin would jump beyond the $300 limit. According to Bitwise Asset Management, Solana has been predicted to rise 300 percent and reach $750 by 2025. Solana is becoming a favorite among developers and institutions as a liquid asset owing to its low cost and fast transaction capabilities. It is a strong contender for the “next Bitcoin” seat. Solana remains an unmissable opportunity for investors seeking a high-growth business with proven momentum and firm prospects.

Trading for the USUAL/USDT pair has started, with deposits and withdrawals available. Usual is an innovative fiat-backed stablecoin protocol focused on security and decentralization. As a multi-chain infrastructure, Usual integrates tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) from entities such as BlackRock, Ondo, and Mountain Protocol, converting them into a permissionless, on-chain verifiable, and composable stablecoin USD0. When users deposit RWAs or USDC/USDT (with a third party providing RWA collateral), they receive USD0, which represents the initial value of the deposit and can be traded freely. $USUAL is the revenue-based governance token of the project. Different from conventional revenue-sharing models redistributing part of the revenue generated by stablecoins, the platform prioritizes user-centric mechanisms by redistributing 100% of value and control through its governance token. This mechanism not only redistributes revenue, it also redistributes ownership of the system, providing incentives for early adopters and offering token holders long-term upside potential. By listing USUAL, Bitget reinforces its commitment to supporting innovative DeFi projects. The inclusion of USUAL aligns with the platform’s broader vision to empower users with access to forward-thinking financial solutions that drive Web3 development.

38005548,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=632242,1734958616,What will happen if Putin’s Russia launches a national Bitcoin strategic reserve before Trump’s America?,"Russia wants to beat America to Bitcoin. The plan? A national Bitcoin reserve. If Vladimir Putin pulls this off before Donald Trump’s America, it won’t just be a win for Russia, it could literally tilt the balance of economic power. Both countries are moving fast, but their strategies couldn’t be more different. While Putin views Bitcoin as a weapon to break free from U.S. dominance, Trump wants to use it to strengthen America’s financial grip. Donald Trump. Credits: Reuters Russia has already faced over 18,700 sanctions since its invasion of Ukraine a few years ago. The country’s $300 billion in foreign reserves is frozen, leaving Putin with few options. Bitcoin offers a way out. Trump, set to take office in January, has his eyes on the same prize. The question is, who gets there first? Putin’s plans Earlier this month, Russian lawmaker Anton Tkachev proposed a strategic Bitcoin reserve. This isn’t about hoarding crypto, it’s about survival. Bitcoin is decentralized, immune, and—most importantly—outside the control of Western financial systems. Tkachev’s proposal aligns with Putin’s public statements calling Bitcoin an “uncensorable asset.” Russia is already exploring Bitcoin-friendly policies. The government sees crypto as a way to bypass international financial blockades. With countries like El Salvador and Poland already holding Bitcoin in their reserves, Russia wants in. Putin’s administration is even looking at using Bitcoin mining as a new revenue stream. With its energy resources, Russia could dominate the mining industry and create an entirely new financial system for the BRICS +. “To use the dollar as a tool of foreign policy struggle is one of the biggest strategic mistakes made by the US political leadership,” Putin has said. “We had no such intention [to reduce dollar usage]. It was the decision of the United States to restrict our transactions in US dollars.” Trump’s ambitions Meanwhile, Trump’s ambitions start with the 200,000 bitcoins already seized by the federal government—worth about $21 billion—and build from there. The U.S. president also floated selling off parts of America’s gold reserves to fund more Bitcoin purchases. Trump isn’t doing this alone. Senator Cynthia Lummis, a longtime Bitcoin lover, proposed legislation to acquire one million bitcoins over five years. That’s about 5% of the total supply. U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis The U.S. government would finance the purchases using surplus Federal Reserve profits and by re-evaluating state-held gold certificates. But Fed chair Jerome Powell seems set to fight against it. Trump’s plan is as much about optics as it is about strategy. He wants to counter Russia and China, both of whom are exploring crypto as a way to challenge the U.S. dollar. The global implications of a Bitcoin race If Russia and the U.S. go all in on Bitcoin, the world will feel it. Bitcoin’s capped supply of 21 million tokens means that any large-scale accumulation will drive up prices. Smaller nations will be priced out, while the two superpowers battle for dominance. Critics say this could lead to market manipulation, with each country trying to outmaneuver the other. For Russia, a Bitcoin reserve could attract other sanctioned nations like Iran or North Korea. These alliances could create a parallel financial system that undermines the U.S.-led global order. On the other hand, America’s reserve would serve to stabilize its financial position, especially as more countries question the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The rivalry doesn’t stop with reserves. Both countries could ramp up Bitcoin mining operations to gain more control over the network. Russia has the energy resources, while the U.S. has the tech infrastructure. If either side gains a huge share of Bitcoin’s hashing power, it could tilt the balance in their favor. Putin and Trump: A complicated dynamic The perceived friendship between Putin and Trump is nothing short of bizarre. Trump has publicly praised Putin, calling him “smart” and “strong,” but their interactions have always been under scrutiny. There have been allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election that Trump won. Since leaving office in 2021, Trump says he hasn’t spoken to Putin. But after his recent election win, Putin congratulated him, calling him “intelligent and experienced.” Notably, he still hasn’t made a direct call, relying instead on informal channels to deliver his message. Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin The cautious nature of their communication shows that neither side is fully ready to trust the other. Trump, for his part, has promised to end the Ukraine war “within 24 hours” of taking office. While he hasn’t shared how he plans to do this, his comments have raised eyebrows in Kyiv. Many suspect that any deal would favor Russia, especially given Trump’s history of liking Putin. A fight over Bitcoin would definitely strain their relationship some more.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | MINING,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/putin-russia-bitcoin-reserve-trump-america/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/38005548.jpeg

38007947,https://cryptonews.com/?p=321992,1734958592,$2 Billion in BTC Leaves Exchanges – Will This Trigger a Rally to $108K for Bitcoin?,"Bitcoin (BTC) has seen a 5% dip over the past week, trading above $96,000 as of today. Despite the price decline, recent on-chain data suggests a bullish sentiment is brewing among market participants. According to CryptoQuant, more than $2.5 billion worth of Bitcoin has been withdrawn from cryptocurrency exchanges in the past seven days, signaling a decrease in selling pressure. Exchange net outflows represent the amount of Bitcoin moved from exchange wallets to private holdings. Large outflows are often seen as a bullish indicator, as investors typically transfer assets off exchanges when they plan to hold rather than trade or sell. Bitcoin Exchange Netflow. Source: CryptoQuant This trend aligns with current market behavior, with fewer BTC available for sale, potentially driving upward price momentum. Bitcoin Technical Outlook: Resistance Levels in Focus Bitcoin is currently facing immediate resistance at $97,250, with stronger barriers at $99,500 and $102,650. On the downside, $94,300 serves as a critical support level, with additional zones at $92,140 and $90,345. Technical indicators highlight mixed sentiment. The RSI hovers near 46, leaning neutral but edging toward oversold conditions. The 50-day EMA, positioned at $96,385, adds dynamic resistance. A decisive breakout above $97,250 could pave the way toward reclaiming the psychological $100,000 level. Conversely, failure to clear resistance might trigger further declines to $92,000. Funding Rates and Market Sentiment In the perpetual futures market, Bitcoin’s funding rate is currently positive at 0.0081. Positive funding rates indicate that traders holding long positions are paying those holding short positions, reinforcing a bullish outlook. Bitcoin Funding Rate. Source: CryptoQuant Analysts note that if the upward trend in funding rates and exchange outflows continues, it could reduce market volatility and support higher prices. Key Takeaways Exchange Outflows : Over $2.5 billion in BTC has left exchanges, signaling reduced selling pressure and bullish sentiment. Resistance Levels : Bitcoin must breach $97,250 to target $100,000; failure risks further declines toward $92,000. Funding Rates : A positive funding rate of 0.0081 reflects a market leaning toward upward momentum. – You might also like Bitcoin Price Prediction 2024 – 2034 $BEST Wallet Raises Over $5.43M: A Limited-Time Crypto Opportunity Best Wallet is reshaping the Web3 landscape, supporting thousands of cryptocurrencies across 50+ major blockchains, including Bitcoin and Ethereum.

38005166,https://coinpedia.org/?p=396538,1734958288,"$300,000 Bitcoin? Analyst Sees Explosive Growth in 2025","The post $300,000 Bitcoin? Analyst Sees Explosive Growth in 2025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As we approach 2025, the big question on everyone’s mind is: Where will Bitcoin go next? With the market showing signs of massive potential, many wonder if the cryptocurrency could skyrocket to new heights. Renowned analyst Michaël van de Poppe is one of the most outspoken voices, predicting that Bitcoin could soar to $250,000 in 2025. But what’s behind this bold prediction, and how likely is it to happen? Let’s dive into the key reasons why Bitcoin could be on the verge of a major breakthrough. Bitcoin’s Strong Performance in 2024 2024 has been an exciting year for Bitcoin. It began with the approval of a Bitcoin ETF, which brought in over $30 billion in inflows, helping the cryptocurrency gain even more attention. Bitcoin’s growing recognition as a legitimate asset continued to grow as countries like Brazil and large companies, such as Amazon, started considering Bitcoin for their balance sheets. By March 2024, Bitcoin had reached $70,000, and after some ups and downs, it peaked at $108,000. These milestones show how Bitcoin is becoming more mainstream and recognized in the global economy. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Liquidity Flows into These Altcoins-ALGO and AAVE Prices Prepare for a Strong Bullish Action , Expectations for Bitcoin in 2025 Looking ahead, Van de Poppe believes that 2025 could be a huge year for Bitcoin, with prices possibly reaching between $200,000 and $300,000. This forecast is based on Bitcoin’s past price patterns: sharp rises during bull markets and drops during bear markets. As Bitcoin nears $100,000, more investors are likely to jump in, hoping to profit from its potential gains. The Impact of Global Money Supply A key factor in van de Poppe’s prediction is the global money supply . As more money is printed around the world, he expects Bitcoin’s price to rise in line with this increase, potentially hitting $132,000 or even more in 2025. This would make Bitcoin an attractive hedge against inflation and a valuable asset for investors looking to protect their wealth. The Role of the Global Economy The global economic environment will also have a major impact on Bitcoin’s future. If the U.S. dollar weakens or interest rates are reduced, Bitcoin could experience a significant rally. In previous cycles, we’ve seen that when global liquidity increases, Bitcoin’s price rises sharply. With the global money supply expected to grow by around 18% in 2025, a new bull market could be on the horizon for Bitcoin. It’s Going to Be a Bumpy Ride! Despite the optimism for 2025, van de Poppe warns that the road ahead may not be entirely smooth. He expects a 25-30% correction in Bitcoin’s price during the first quarter of 2025, similar to the correction we saw in 2024. After that, Bitcoin could experience a period of sideways movement, much like what we saw in 2023. Right now, Bitcoin is trading around $96,000 , reflecting a slight 1% drop in the past 24 hours.

38004977,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=313868,1734957912,"Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Can Pay Off Over a Third of US National Debt by 2050, According to VanEck Executive","The head of digital assets research at exchange-traded fund (ETF) provider VanEck says a strategic Bitcoin ( BTC ) reserve can help the US pay off its rapidly accelerating national debt in about 25 years. In a new thread on the social media platform X, VanEck executive Matthew Sigel shows how a strategic Bitcoin reserve could improve the United States’ financial position by 2050. In July, Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming said she would announce a bill to establish a BTC reserve that would drive the US government to accumulate one million Bitcoin in five years. According to Sigel’s data, the one million Bitcoin trove would be valued at $42.4 trillion in 2049 while the US national debt would be worth $119.3 trillion. “Assume the US Treasury starts buying one million Bitcoin over five years at a starting price of $200,000. Assume US debt grows at 5% (vs. last 10 years 8% compound annual growth rate) and BTC price compounds at 25%. In such a scenario, the US Strategic BTC Reserve would hold assets equivalent to 36% of debt by 2050. In that scenario, BTC would be $42 million/coin (same as Michael Saylor’s target, coincidentally) and the market cap would be 18% of global financial assets. But even at a 15% compound annual growth rate, the BTC stash would still be quite valuable” Source: Matthew Sigel/X Sigel’s estimates come as Senator Lummis reiterates the need to create a US strategic Bitcoin reserve. “To be clear, the ‘strategic’ purpose of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve is to: explicitly, strategically, pay down government debt hanging over the head of every American. Put future Americans on a better footing, unencumbered by debt that they never supported or benefitted from… The bill language is to HODL (hold on for dear life) for twenty years (minimum) and establishes proof of reserves. By that time, the proper next action will be self-evident.” At time of writing, Bitcoin is worth $94,839.

38005031,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=632192,1734957773,Fed’s Mary Daly discusses AI and its impact on US Productivity,"Mary Daly was a young economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco in the late 1990s, helping then-chair Alan Greenspan realize the previous big rise in US productivity. But now, she says she feels there’s another similar upswing, this time fueled by artificial intelligence. In an interview on Bloomberg’s Odd Lots podcast, Daly, now president of the San Francisco Fed, said, “We’re seeing it everywhere,” referring to the productivity pushed by AI. Measured productivity has risen in the US over the past few years, but economists are not in agreement on the cause or whether it will continue rising. However, sustained productivity growth could be a great benefit. She said it is “really about machine learning. It’s about robotic processing, automation, just people and businesses doing things”. Furthermore, she added that it’s not going to show up in measured productivity immediately. However, there’s still a drive for change. Productivity is how much labor (labor + capital) it costs to produce a product or service. Higher productivity means more production without additional work. Productivity also plays an important role in enhancing overall living standards. Despite this, it’s also difficult to measure. In 1987, economist Robert Solow wrote, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” Daly says that history is repeating itself, this time with AI Alan Greenspan believed it was happening in the late 1990s while witnessing the start of the information technology revolution, which was changing businesses. Economists were asked to find examples of how companies were using technology in practice. The findings at least helped convince the Fed chair that productivity really was increasing, and that influenced monetary policy. “He turned out to be right,” Daly said. She shared that productivity was in a disorganized state, and eventually, when the data was updated, they had a better understanding of the computer revolution. “We realized we were living in a computer revolution.” Daly says the San Francisco Fed’s Emerging Tech Economic Research Network is trying to reproduce the research done by Greenspan a generation ago. “We’re spending a lot of time with researchers, but we’re also spending a lot of time with CEOs and CIOs, and we’re asking them, what are you doing?” She added that although the focus is on the US first, a large number of companies all over the globe are using AI, just like in the United States. Sounding optimistic about AI , Daly said it’s about how businesses use the technology to strengthen and enhance their teams. This also means getting the job done with less tiring work. “And I think that’s potentially a huge benefit. It could take a decade, but it is happening,” she concluded.

The Tokyo-listed company said it bought a record 619.70 BTC for 9.5 billion yen ($61 million) in a move that lifted its BTC holdings by 54%.    BTC is still 1.5% lower over 24 hours, CoinGecko data shows, with ether (ETH), Cardano’s ADA, Solana’s SOL and dogecoin (DOGE) all down as much as 2%. Chainlink’s LINK and Tron’s TRX gained, while the broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20) index fell 1.39%.    Metaplanet has now acquired 1,762 BTC for 20.87 billion yen ($133.2 million), with an average purchase price of 11.85 million yen. Between Oct. 1 and Dec. 23, the company achieved a BTC yield of 309.82%, up from the 41.7% for Jul. 1-Sep. 30.    Metaplanet experimented with novel ways of funding its bitcoin buys since it first started the strategy in April. As of Dec. 20, the company issued a $5.0 billion yen 5th Series of Ordinary Bonds to EVO FUND, a zero-coupon bond maturing June 16, 2025 with early redemption possible linked to the 12th series stock acquisition rights.    In total, the company has made 19 separate bitcoin purchases using capital market activities and operating income. The shares have skyrocketed 2,100% this year, and the company has become the 15th-largest publicly traded bitcoin holder.    Meanwhile, market watchers are cautious ahead of the holiday period with a short-term bearish bias.    “Markets continue to digest the Fed's tougher tone, reinforced by the accumulated urge to lock in profits after a strong year,” Alex Kuptsikevich, FxPro chief market analyst, told CoinDesk in an email. “Bitcoin is trading around $95.5K, receiving support near the 50-day moving average on Friday and Monday.

Join the Dogen Army today and conquer the crypto world! Solana’s SOL: A High-Speed Blockchain for Scalable Decentralized Applications Solana is a blockchain platform that prioritizes scalability, offering a foundation for decentralized applications with faster transactions and support for multiple programming languages. Its native cryptocurrency, SOL, is central to the ecosystem, enabling transactions, running custom programs, and rewarding network participants. Unlike some platforms that rely on sharding or second-layer solutions, Solana focuses on a high-capacity network to attract developers and investors. The potential of SOL lies in its ability to support a wide range of high-activity projects and services. In the current market cycle, Solana’s emphasis on speed and scalability positions it as an attractive option for those interested in decentralized applications and blockchain technology. Cardano (ADA): A Scalable and Sustainable Blockchain Platform Cardano is a blockchain platform built for smart contracts, enabling decentralized finance apps, crypto tokens, and games. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, lets users store value, make payments, and stake on the network. Cardano stands out for its energy-efficient proof-of-stake mechanism, Ouroboros, which is more sustainable than traditional proof-of-work models. The blockchain is divided into two layers: the Settlement Layer for transactions and the Computing Layer for smart contracts. This design enhances its transaction processing capability, potentially up to a million transactions per second. With its focus on scalability and sustainability, ADA shows strong potential. In the current market cycle, the coin appears attractive due to its innovative technology. Polkadot (DOT): Enabling Secure Communication Between Blockchains Polkadot is a decentralized protocol and cryptocurrency that enables secure communication between different blockchains. It allows value and data to be shared across networks like Ethereum and Bitcoin without the need for intermediaries. By employing parachains, Polkadot enhances speed and scalability, processing more transactions than Bitcoin and Ethereum. The Polkadot token (DOT) is used for governance and staking within its network, allowing holders to participate in decision-making and transaction verification. Developed by Ethereum co-creator Gavin Wood and maintained by the Web3 Foundation, Polkadot launched on May 26, 2020. Its focus on interoperability and efficiency positions it as a significant player in the evolving blockchain landscape, attracting attention in the current market cycle. Chainlink (LINK): Bridging Smart Contracts with Real-World Data Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network that connects smart contracts to real-world data. It allows blockchains to access external data sources, APIs, and systems, expanding the capabilities of smart contracts beyond the blockchain. Chainlink uses oracles to fetch data, aggregates it to ensure accuracy, and delivers it securely to smart contracts. The LINK token rewards node operators, supports staking for network security, and pays for data services. This ensures the system’s reliability and decentralization. Chainlink’s technology has the potential to enhance blockchain applications by bridging them with external systems. In the current market cycle, LINK’s role in connecting smart contracts with real-world data may make it an attractive option in the blockchain space. Conclusion While SOL, ADA, DOT, and LINK have limited short-term potential, DOGEN stands out. Designed for those seeking excellence, it embodies luxury and success. Expected to grow 700% by presale’s end with potential for massive returns, it follows successful tokens like BONK, WIF, and Popcat. DOGEN builds a community of leaders, offering real benefits like exclusive campaigns and perks for early adopters.

38004635,https://coinpedia.org/?p=396615,1734957154,Top 2 Reasons Why Hype Token Price Crashed 20%,"The post Top 2 Reasons Why Hype Token Price Crashed 20% appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News After a strong rally, Hyperliquid’s native token, HYPE, has dropped 20%, now trading at $26.54. The platform’s market cap also slid below $9 billion. Two major events caused this decline: a large sell-off by whale investor Laurent Zeimes and a cyberattack from North Korean state-sponsored hackers. The first blow came when Laurent Zeimes, a major whale, sold over 1 million tokens. This sell-off caused panic in the market and led to a sharp decline in the price of HYPE. Turns out, both factors played a part, but there’s more to the story. Read on to know what’s really at stake. North Korean Hackers Disrupt Hyperliquid The situation worsened when North Korean hackers turned their attention to Hyperliquid. Over the weekend, wallets linked to these hackers reportedly executed trades on the platform, resulting in losses of over $700,000. DPRK's trading career is…uh….going….. tbh if i was the dude managing Hyperliquid's 4 validators (or those fucking ghetto ass binaries on gh) I would be shitting my pants right now. Hyperliquid dudes dont seem worried at all though so im sure its fine. pic.twitter.com/JrrU7t1sJe — Tay (@tayvano_) December 22, 2024 Cybersecurity experts like Tayvano believe these trades were part of an effort to find weaknesses in Hyperliquid’s system. Despite the warnings, the platform’s team appears unconcerned, with Tayvano commenting, “I f I were managing Hyperliquid’s four validators, I’d be worried,” lol @ all you retards who think the risk is USG forcing Hyperliquid to freeze AAAAAAAAAAHHAHAHHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHA Yall, DPRK doesn't trade. DPRK tests. — Tay (@tayvano_) December 22, 2024 North Korea’s Record-Breaking Year in Cybercrime Notably, 2024 has been the most profitable year for North Korean hackers, with over $1.34 billion stolen across 47 cyberattacks, according to Chainalysis . This staggering figure accounts for 61% of the year’s total crypto theft, marking a 21% increase from 2023. Major heists include $305 million from DMM Bitcoin in May and $235 million from WazirX in July. Most attacks result from private key compromises, which make up 44% of the total losses, underscoring the urgent need for stronger security measures. North Korea uses these illicit gains to fund its weapons programs, and experts warn that attacks are increasing in frequency and scope, now targeting smaller sums as well. According to Lookonchain, the hackers went long on ETH as well at $3,791.8 but were liquidated when ETH’s price fell to $3,251.8, resulting in a $458K loss in just two days. Pros and Cons Analysis In a notable incident, hackers took long positions on ETH at $3,791.8 but were liquidated when ETH’s price dropped to $3,251.8, losing $458K in just two days, according to Lookonchain. Despite these risks, crypto analyst Cygaar reassured the community, noting that if three of Hyperliquid’s four validators were compromised, attackers could potentially withdraw $2.3 billion in USDC. However, Cygaar pointed out that Hyperliquid has strong defenses in place, such as Circle freezing stolen funds and Arbitrum rolling back the chain to restore the bridge. While there are risks, Cygaar believes there is no immediate cause for panic. tldr of the HyperLiquid situation: The Bad: – Wouldn't be surprised if North Korean hackers were looking at ways to attack – 3/4 validators would need to be compromised to withdraw all 2.3B USDC from the bridge The Good: – 2 lines of defense can kick in to prevent money from… — cygaar (@0xCygaar) December 23, 2024 .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Hack Weekly Report: $2.2 Billion Stolen in 2024, Centralized Exchanges Hit Hard , Hyperliquid’s Impressive Growth Despite the challenges, Hyperliquid has become the largest on-chain trading platform, with 271,000 users, $12.14 billion in total deposits, and a daily trading volume of $6.20 billion. Its native token, HYPE, which launched on November 29, has surged from $1.97 to $27.97, now boasting a market cap of $9.35 billion, making it the 22nd largest cryptocurrency. With North Korea’s increasing cyberattacks, it’s clear that these hackers are a significant threat to the global economy. The difficulty in preventing such thefts, combined with their ability to probe systems for vulnerabilities, could lead to more disruptions in the crypto market. The crypto community will be closely watching how this situation unfolds. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

With a dual role as a university professor in management and entrepreneurship, Dr. Ditsche brings a unique blend of academic insight and hands-on industry expertise. His career spans leadership in industrial giants, private equity, and M&A, alongside a passion for fostering startups as an investor and advisory board member. Having lived and worked across Germany, France, Italy, the UK, and the US, Dr. Ditsche’s international experience positions him as a thought leader on remote work, innovation, and the evolving iGaming landscape. Invezz: In your experience, what are the primary factors driving the rapid growth of the iGaming sector in recent years, and how do you see this trajectory evolving in the next 5-10 years? The pandemic played a pivotal role in accelerating the growth of the iGaming sector, as lockdowns and restrictions limited entertainment options, making online gaming one of the few available pastimes. Additionally, the opening of the North American market has fueled this expansion. Another significant factor has been the positive impact of regulation. Licensing has made gambling more socially acceptable and accessible, although the effectiveness of regulatory regimes varies by country. For instance, in the UK, more than 90% of the market is channelled into the regulated space, whereas in countries like Germany, the illegal market continues to thrive despite regulation. I expect modest single-digit growth for the sector, with a continued shift towards regulated markets and greater societal acceptance. Invezz: How do emerging technologies, such as blockchain and AI, influence the development of the iGaming sector, and what role do they play in maintaining competitive advantage? The future of iGaming will be defined by personalized entertainment, excitement, and unique experiences. Emerging technologies such as blockchain and AI are essential in tailoring the gaming experience to individual preferences. As players increasingly seek community-driven experiences, these technologies will facilitate social interactions within virtual groups, even during solo gameplay. Blockchain and NFTs will also allow for the creation of unique, verifiable in-game items, such as trophies, which will enhance the emotional appeal of online gambling. With the growing number of available games, bots will help players choose the most suitable options, and the social aspect of gaming will distinguish one provider from another. Invezz: The iGaming industry often faces varying regulations across jurisdictions. How can companies effectively navigate these challenges, and what trends do you foresee in global regulatory frameworks? Today, the iGaming industry is a multi-billion-dollar business, supported by highly skilled legal teams, business development experts, and lobbyists who track market trends and regulatory developments. While country-specific regulations present challenges, particularly for smaller providers, economies of scale will play an increasingly important role, leading to market consolidation. A key regulatory challenge is channelization—encouraging players to migrate from the black market to regulated environments. This can be achieved through either strict enforcement or by making regulated offerings more attractive. Evidence suggests that a more appealing regulated market yields better results than punitive measures. For example, Germany’s tax revenue from online gambling has fallen nearly 70% over the past three years, largely due to players shifting to the illegal market. Beyond the loss of tax revenue, the bigger issue is that players are left unprotected in these illegal spaces. I anticipate that more legislators will focus on creating attractive regulated markets in the years to come. Invezz: From an investor’s perspective, what are the key opportunities and risks when entering the iGaming sector, and how should one evaluate the long-term sustainability of such investments? The iGaming sector presents significant opportunities due to its profitability, scalability, and global reach, though it may not appeal to all investors, particularly those with ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) concerns. Regulation enhances the sustainability of investments by fostering societal acceptance and providing a degree of stability. Changes within existing regulatory frameworks tend to be less disruptive than the transition from unregulated to regulated markets, making investments more palatable. Moreover, human nature, the inherent desire to play games, ensures long-term demand, and legislators are likely to continue accommodating this need. Invezz: As a leader with extensive experience in remote work, what strategies do you recommend for iGaming companies to maintain productivity, innovation, and a strong corporate culture in a predominantly remote work environment? The iGaming industry, with its intangible products, is a prime example of how remote work, flexible work models, and global networks can be leveraged to drive success. At the core of this is the belief that culture trumps strategy. A strong corporate culture is essential for sustaining remote organisations, and increasing regulation is helping improve the industry’s reputation, allowing employees to take pride in their work. At iGaming.com Group GmbH, we treat our employees as adults, trusting them to manage their work schedules and locations. This autonomy fosters transparency, ownership, and a sense of accomplishment. We believe that a culture of dignity, respect, and appreciation is fundamental to innovation and creativity, regardless of organizational structure.

In a post on X, ""Crypto Vilian,"" a Cambridge graduate and market chartist, analyzed XRP's historical price chart. He drew parallels between its current market structure and the pattern from late 2017.The chart highlights a sequence of phases: a steep bearish decline, a recovery phase, and a consolidation period, followed by a significant breakout to the upside.During the 2017 rally, this breakout led to a brief consolidation before XRP's explosive move to an all-time high.According to the chart, XRP appears to be replicating this pattern over the past seven years. The token recently broke out of a prolonged bearish trend and entered a recovery and consolidation phase, culminating in a major breakout last month.Moreover, the current ranging pattern aligns with the historical trajectory, suggesting that XRP could be on the verge of another explosive move—potentially reaching new all-time highs akin to the 2017/2018 surge. XRP chart by Crypto Vilian Notably, Crypto Vilian's chart suggests that XRP could surpass a $1 trillion market cap in this cycle should the explosive surge occur. This would equate to a price above $17 for XRP. Not Holding XRP Could Be One of the Biggest MistakesThis observation has caught the attention of many in the crypto community. Xoom, a notable market commentator with 14.8K followers on X, remarked that failing to include XRP in one's portfolio during this bull run could be one of the biggest mistakes by an investor.XRP has been trading at a discount for the past few days amid the ongoing broader market downturn led by Bitcoin . At a market price of $2.20, XRP has shed approximately 9% of its value over the past week.Considering that it traded at a seven-year high of $2.90 precisely three weeks ago, the asset is currently trading at a 24% discount from this peak.Now, as market participants await a rebound from the multiple weeks of consolidation, analysts are calling attention to promising signs on XRP's chart, ones that preceded explosive price gains for the asset.Caution for XRP Holders Targeting to Sell at the TopWhile Crypto Vilian's chart presents a promising outlook, he has cautioned that reaching the trillion-dollar threshold will depend on Bitcoin's performance. Specifically, an upward trend could benefit altcoins, while a decline may negatively affect the outlook.He also clarified that his chart aims not to predict price targets but to illustrate price behavior. Regarding potential targets, he noted technical price levels between $8 and $13.In his view, if XRP breaks through that range, it could theoretically experience a 2x-3x increase, potentially reaching the technical target for the contracting triangle Elliott wave pattern . However, this would imply a nearly 100x gain from the lows of $0.30.Accordingly, Crypto Vilian emphasized that he hopes XRP holders are not waiting to sell at the exact top. He advocates taking profits at key targets along the way up. ""After all, no one went broke taking profits early,"" he said.",POSITIVE,XRP,BTC | MARKET | TRADING | XRP | ZRX,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/23/expert-says-ignoring-xrp-this-bull-run-could-be-one-of-the-biggest-mistakes-cites-probable-1t-market-cap/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=expert-says-ignoring-xrp-this-bull-run-could-be-one-of-the-biggest-mistakes-cites-probable-1t-market-cap,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png
38004643,https://zycrypto.com/?p=99278,1734957049,"XRP Leads Altcoin Trading Volume in December, Will XRP Price Explode?","XRP ranked top among the most traded altcoins in December after a period marked with mixed movements. The asset price spiked to new highs not seen in three years before dropping nearly in two weeks. Despite this trend, it ranked above major altcoins in several metrics. Recent data shows XRP became the most traded altcoin on Binance in December. With days left to the new year, the asset’s volumes continue to soar alongside its institutional funds. On the Binance futures market, the asset’s trading volume hit a staggering high of $116.6 billion with slight periods of sideways trading. According to Maartum, XRP has shown signs of recovery above other assets in the past 48 hours. This follows high sell pressure that plagued Bitcoin and the wider market, with some coins posting double-digit outflows. “ XRP is the most traded altcoin on the Binance Futures market, with a trading volume of 116.6B already, and the month isn’t over yet. It’s important to track the top-traded coins on Binance, as they should be your main focus when trading altcoins. In the past two days, both Bitcoin and altcoins have experienced large declines. XRP seems to be one that could recover quickly.” Trading volumes on Binance are closely monitored to give traders a general sense of the market. Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volumes, is a major driver due to major whale and retail activity. Institutional Players Drive XRP Volume The activities of traditional and large stakeholders bolstered investor confidence in crypto assets. After the United States election, investors dominated the scene, setting sights on new gains. New flows sent the price of Bitcoin above $90K before hitting higher levels. This sparked a similar momentum in altcoins , with XRP and Solana being the biggest gainers. XRP jumped to a three-year high, temporarily outpacing Tether by market cap. Trading at $2.6, its market cap topped $130 billion alongside surging trading volumes. Institutional investors flooded XRP for two reasons; its utility in cross-border payments and anticipated clear rules in the United States. Over the years, Ripple has tapped several central banks and organizations towards cross-border payments and Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) architecture. The company also faced headwinds after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against the firm for offering unregistered securities.

38004558,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=666321,1734957027,Dogecoin Price Roadmap To $0.75 ATH: Why The Next Wave Is Bearish And Could Drop To $0.15,"Crypto analyst Behdark has provided an in-depth analysis of the Dogecoin price roadmap to its current all-time high (ATH) of $0.75. In his analysis, he explains why Dogecoin could still witness a significant correction before it rallies to its current ATH. Dogecoin Price Next Wave Is Bearish In a TradingView post, Behdark stated that the Dogecoin price seems to be entering wave F, which is a bearish wave. The crypto analyst noted that the previous corrective waves of this diametric lasted between 196 and 347 days, so this wave F is also expected to last between 196 and 347 days. Related Reading: Bitcoin $178K Target In Sight? Analyst Highlights Bollinger Band Retest Mirroring Jan. 2024 Rally The analyst’s accompanying chart showed that the Dogecoin price could drop to as low as $0.15 on this wave F corrective move. Similar to waves B and D, the analyst remarked that this corrective wave is expected to be highly volatile. Based on the 196 to 347-day timeline, this corrective wave might not end until sometime in November 2025. Once the corrective wave F is done, the Dogecoin price will transition to wave G. Behdark stated that Wave G will be a bullish wave that might lead to a new ATH. The accompanying chart showed that Dogecoin could reach around $0.8 on this impulsive move to the upside. However, the much-anticipated psychological $1 price level could still elude the foremost meme coin. Meanwhile, the crypto analyst added that a weekly candle below the invalidation level at $0.12 would invalidate the buy outlook for the green zone between $0.15 and $0.20. Behdark’s analysis provides a completely different perspective for the Dogecoin price, considering that crypto analysts like Trader Tardigrade have predicted that the meme coin could rally to double digits before mid-2025. Behdark’s analysis also suggests that the Dogecoin price is unlikely to reach $1 in this market cycle, a target market participants have set their eyes on since the meme coin began its parabolic rally between October and November. Four-Year Cycle Still In Play Crypto analyst KrissPax provided a more bullish outlook for the Dogecoin price, stating that the four-year cycle is still in play. The analyst cited a historical pattern in which Dogecoin took off in January 2021 after an uptrend in late December 2020. He then raised the possibility of this historical trend repeating itself again. Related Reading: XRP Battles Critical $2.20 Support Level — Will It Target $2.70 Or Slip To $1.96? Crypto analyst Master Kenobi had before now also suggested that a Dogecoin price rebound was likely in January 2025 as he alluded to the historical pattern in the 2021 bull run. The crypto analyst believes that Dogecoin could reach a new ATH around Donald Trump’s inauguration, especially with the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E) coming to life when Trump takes office. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.31, down almost 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

38006064,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52883,1734957023,"Best Coins to Join This Month:Qubetics Leads with Over $7.5 Million Raised, Alongside Bitcoin Cash and Render","Cryptocurrency has long captured the imagination of investors, from savvy Wall Street pros to everyday individuals looking for the next big thing. These digital assets aren’t just speculative bets anymore—they’re reshaping finance and challenging the dominance of traditional investment options like stocks and real estate. Among the most exciting players in the game right now are Qubetics presale (TICS) , Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and Render (RNDR). Each of these projects has carved out a distinct identity and built a strong community of believers. When it comes to finding the best coins to join this month , Qubetics is at the top of everyone’s radar. This emerging powerhouse is making waves with its innovative approach to real-world asset tokenisation and an impressive presale performance that has analysts predicting jaw-dropping returns. Let’s dive into what makes Qubetics, Bitcoin Cash, and Render stand out as go-to investment options this month. Qubetics: Redefining Asset Tokenisation Qubetics (TICS) is the new kid on the blockchain, but don’t let its newcomer status fool you. This project has already achieved milestones that even veteran cryptocurrencies envy. Currently in its 13th presale stage, Qubetics has sold over 367 million $TICS tokens to more than 11,300 holders, raising a staggering $7.5 million. Right now, you can scoop up $TICS for just $0.0342 per token, but hurry—the price is set to jump by 10% this weekend. What really sets Qubetics apart is its focus on real-world asset tokenisation (RWAT). Let’s put it in simple terms. Imagine owning a fraction of a high-end luxury property in New York or a Picasso painting, all through blockchain. Tokenisation breaks down these high-value assets into digital tokens that anyone can buy, sell, or trade. Qubetics is leading the charge in this space, making it easier for businesses, professionals, and regular folks to access assets once reserved for the wealthy elite. Think about it: a small business could tokenize its invoices, giving it quick access to cash flow without waiting on long payment cycles. For professionals, RWAT could streamline the ownership of tools, licenses, or intellectual property, creating liquid markets for previously illiquid assets. And for individuals? Imagine tokenising your car or home equity, unlocking funds without cumbersome loan processes. Qubetics is building a blockchain ecosystem where these scenarios aren’t just possible—they’re practical. The hype around Qubetics isn’t just noise. Analysts predict that $TICS could hit $10-$15 after the mainnet launch, with incremental milestones like $0.25 at the end of the presale (a 630% ROI) and $1 shortly after (a 2820% ROI). For context, a $1,250 investment at the current price of $0.0342 could potentially grow to $18,250 at $1 and a staggering $546,875 if $TICS hits $15. These projections aren’t just exciting—they’re life-changing. With its presale momentum and revolutionary use cases, Qubetics is undeniably one of the best coins to join this month. Don’t wait for the price hike this weekend—act now and secure your position in what could be the next big crypto success story. Bitcoin Cash: The Everyday Payment Pioneer If Bitcoin is the gold standard of crypto, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is its more accessible sibling. Born out of a fork from Bitcoin in 2017, Bitcoin Cash was designed to tackle one major problem: scalability. While Bitcoin focuses on being a store of value, BCH aims to be a fast, low-cost payment system that’s actually usable for day-to-day transactions. Bitcoin Cash has cemented its reputation as one of the best coins to join this month, thanks to its ability to process transactions at a fraction of the cost and time of Bitcoin. Its larger block size means it can handle more transactions per second, making it a favourite among merchants and users alike. In the crypto community, BCH is the go-to coin for payments and remittances. It’s widely accepted by retailers worldwide, from coffee shops to e-commerce giants. Need to send money abroad? Bitcoin Cash makes international transfers a breeze, with minimal fees and instant processing times. Its user-friendly design and commitment to real-world utility make it a cornerstone of the blockchain ecosystem. Over the years, BCH has weathered its share of ups and downs, but its resilience and utility have kept it relevant. As cryptocurrencies become more integrated into mainstream finance, Bitcoin Cash’s payment capabilities make it a solid alternative to traditional financial systems. If you’re eyeing practical crypto investments, BCH is a no-brainer. Render: Powering the Digital Frontier Render (RNDR) takes blockchain beyond finance and into the world of creative industries. This unique crypto project leverages decentralised GPU rendering to bring high-quality 3D graphics and animation to life. In simple terms, Render provides a marketplace where artists, designers, and developers can access GPU power for rendering their projects, all while getting rewarded in RNDR tokens. Render is a darling of the crypto community, especially among creatives and tech enthusiasts. It’s the first blockchain project to tackle the rendering bottleneck, a pain point for industries ranging from gaming to architecture. By decentralising the rendering process, Render makes it faster, cheaper, and more accessible. Picture this: you’re an indie game developer with a shoestring budget. Instead of spending thousands on rendering services, you use Render’s network to tap into a pool of GPUs worldwide. Not only do you save money, but you’re also supporting a decentralised economy where contributors—whether individuals or data centres—earn RNDR tokens for lending their processing power. Render has become a go-to investment for those who believe in blockchain’s ability to revolutionise industries beyond finance. With the growing demand for high-quality visuals in gaming, VR, and metaverse projects, RNDR’s use case is only set to expand. It’s no wonder Render is often listed among the best coins to join this month for those looking to diversify their crypto portfolio. Conclusion: Qubetics Leads the Pack If you’re hunting for the best coins to join this month , Qubetics, Bitcoin Cash, and Render are your top contenders. Each project offers something unique: Qubetics is revolutionising asset ownership through real-world tokenisation, Bitcoin Cash is redefining everyday payments, and Render is empowering creatives with decentralised rendering solutions. But let’s be real: Qubetics is stealing the show right now. With its presale in full swing and $TICS tokens priced at just $0.0342 , now’s the perfect time to get in. Don’t miss your chance to join over 11,300 holders who’ve already recognised the game-changing potential of this project. Analysts are predicting massive returns, so why wait?

Make Qubetics Your Best Crypto Investment in December 2024,"The crypto market never sleeps, and December 2024 is no exception. VeChain (VET), the blockchain powerhouse for supply chain solutions, has captured headlines with its impressive bull run over the past year. From enabling real-time product tracking to transforming industries like retail and pharmaceuticals, VeChain has carved out a niche that’s both practical and profitable. But let’s be real—if you missed VeChain’s meteoric rise, you’re probably kicking yourself right now. The good news? There’s another star on the horizon. Enter Qubetics ( $TICS ), a blockchain project that’s not just riding the crypto wave but redefining it. With its focus on Real World Asset Tokenisation (RWAT), Qubetics is solving problems that have plagued traditional industries for decades. And with its presale making waves, it’s shaping up to be the best crypto to buy in December 2024 for those looking to turn missed opportunities into massive gains. Qubetics ($TICS): Redefining Blockchain’s Role in the Real World Qubetics isn’t just another blockchain project; it’s a game-changer. This Web3 aggregator combines cutting-edge tech with real-world solutions to make blockchain practical, accessible, and profitable for everyday people. At its core lies Real World Asset Tokenisation, a revolutionary approach that allows users to own fractions of high-value assets, such as luxury real estate, fine art, or even rare collectibles. Picture this: A teacher in Chicago wants to invest but finds the stock market too volatile and real estate too expensive. With Qubetics, they can own a slice of a Beverly Hills mansion or invest in a tokenised Picasso. Meanwhile, a tech startup in Berlin looking for innovative funding can tokenise its intellectual property, attracting global micro-investments. Qubetics doesn’t just bridge gaps; it builds highways to opportunity. Adding to its appeal, Qubetics offers a Decentralised VPN for unparalleled online security and privacy. Its multi-chain wallet streamlines the process of managing assets across different blockchains. And with its No KYC policy, users can enjoy privacy without the hassle of extensive verification processes. Currently in Presale Phase 13, Qubetics has raised over $7.5M and sold more than 367M tokens. At $0.0311 per token, the next phase brings a 10% price hike, making this a prime moment for early investors. Analysts predict a post-presale price of $0.25, translating to a jaw-dropping 900% ROI. Why is Qubetics a standout among the best cryptos to buy in December 2024? Its ability to blend innovation with real-world utility makes it a no-brainer for investors hungry for both growth and impact. VeChain (VET): The Supply Chain Innovator VeChain has made a name for itself by revolutionising supply chain management. With its blockchain-powered solutions, VeChain enables businesses to track products throughout their lifecycle, ensuring transparency, authenticity, and efficiency. From tracking wine authenticity in Bordeaux to monitoring vaccine distribution in Asia, VeChain has proven that blockchain isn’t just hype—it’s a necessity for modern logistics. Recent developments in VeChain’s ecosystem, like the introduction of its fee delegation feature, have further cemented its utility. This feature allows businesses to absorb transaction costs, making it easier for non-crypto users to adopt VeChain’s solutions. Add to that its growing list of partnerships with major brands, and it’s clear that VeChain is here to stay. VeChain’s price has seen consistent growth, bolstered by its utility and adoption across various industries. However, with its market cap climbing steadily, some analysts question how much explosive growth remains for VET. While it’s a strong bet for long-term stability, newer projects like Qubetics might offer higher short-term returns for those looking to capitalise on emerging trends. Why is VeChain one of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024? Its proven track record in solving real-world problems makes it a cornerstone of any diversified crypto portfolio. Don’t Let Another Opportunity Pass You By When you compare Qubetics to VeChain, the differences are stark yet complementary. VeChain has established itself as a reliable player in the blockchain space, focusing on supply chain management with a proven track record. Its solutions are tailored for businesses, making it a solid choice for those seeking stability and steady returns. On the other hand, Qubetics is all about untapped potential. While VeChain solves specific industry problems, Qubetics tackles a broader spectrum of real-world challenges. Whether it’s tokenising assets, securing online interactions with its decentralised VPN, or enabling seamless multi-chain asset management, Qubetics has positioned itself as a versatile and forward-thinking platform. For investors, the choice boils down to your goals. If you’re after stability and proven value, VeChain is a no-brainer.

With its presale attracting thousands of investors and its applications solving problems across industries, Qubetics is poised to be the best crypto to buy in December 2024 for those ready to seize the moment.

38004641,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=632224,1734956861,Elon Musk and Trump might actually break up next year. What will happen to D.O.G.E then?,"Donald Trump and Elon Musk might be heading for a breakup, and it’s not the kind of split anyone saw coming. You see, even before he officially takes back his Oval, the president is already dealing with whispers that Elon has more influence over his presidency than anyone should. If they go their separate ways next year, the fate of their ambitious project, the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E) would be thrown into chaos. “Let’s get one thing straight,” Trump reportedly said onstage in Phoenix during Turning Point USA’s AmericaFest conference. “No, he’s not going to be president, that I can tell you. And I’m safe. You know why he can’t be? He wasn’t born in this country.” The crowd ate it up, chanting Trump’s name as smoke and sparklers lit up the stage. Trump stood in his signature red tie, basking in the attention. Tensions rise as Elon overshadows Trump The partnership between the billionaire tech mogul and the president started with grand promises but has begun to look like a ticking time bomb. Elon isn’t exactly shy about shaking things up. Just last week, he helped derail an emergency spending measure in Congress, an act that made headlines and left the Democrats and even some Republicans fuming. Elon’s unpredictable nature, coupled with his growing political influence, has started to rub Trump the wrong way. Insiders say Trump is tired of Elon’s growing profile and doesn’t appreciate the shadow it casts over his administration. The cracks began to show as Elon’s involvement in D.O.G.E started drawing more attention, especially as he seeks to defund organizations like the IRS and the Federal Reserve . D.O.G.E’s mission is to slash up to $2 trillion in wasteful spending by cutting bloated agencies and eliminating useless regulations. Elon and Vivek Ramaswamy were handpicked by Trump to lead the charge, but Elon’s star power is overshadowing the president in ways he clearly doesn’t like. “He’s not running the country. Not ever,” Trump declared, shutting down rumors that Elon might even want to run for office. “The Constitution says you have to be born here. He wasn’t. End of story.” What happens to D.O.G.E without Elon? For starters, D.O.G.E doesn’t have formal approval from Congress, which means it’s functioning more like a high-profile advisory group than an actual federal department. Its goal to save $2 trillion by July 4, 2026—the 250th anniversary of American independence—sounds great on paper, but without Elon’s leadership, the chances of pulling it off shrink dramatically. His reputation for innovation and his ability to disrupt entire industries are the kind of qualities this project depends on. Losing him would strip D.O.G.E of its most powerful asset. Vivek, while a capable entrepreneur in his own right, doesn’t have the same pull. The US federal budget is $6.5 trillion annually, and Trump’s administration promised to find massive savings by dissecting every line of spending. Critics have already pointed out that these kinds of cuts could trigger layoffs, disrupt public services, and create chaos in government operations. Without Elon, even those shaky plans might completely collapse. But the fallout from a Trump-Elon split would extend far beyond D.O.G.E. Trump’s supporters have embraced Elon as part of the team, seeing their partnership as a powerful alliance against Washington’s entrenched bureaucracy. If Elon walks away, some of Trump’s base (especially the tech-savvy younger crowd and the wealthy donors who admire Elon’s vision) might follow him out the door. On the other hand, breaking ties with Elon could help Trump regain control over his own narrative. But the risks are real. The Republican Party is already showing signs of internal division. House Republicans have been increasingly defiant, with some openly ignoring Trump’s directives. Losing Elon could fire up these groups, making it even tougher for Trump to keep control of the party and push his agenda. It could also open the door for new GOP leaders who aren’t so tied to Trump’s populist style and lean more toward old-school conservative values.",NEGATIVE,없음,DOGE | FIAT | REGULATION,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/elon-trump-break-up-next-year-d-o-g-e/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/38004641.jpeg

Amid the broader market correction, altcoins have experienced significant losses. Cardano has seen a substantial drop during this correction phase, losing the critical $1 psychological level.Will increased speculation in the market lead to a rapid decline in Cardano prices, or is a bullish reversal possible?Cardano Price AnalysisCurrently, Cardano is trading at $0.90, with an intraday gain of 1.93%. This recovery comes after a bearish weekend, during which the price dropped 4.84% on Saturday, followed by a 3.32% decline on Sunday.At present, ADA struggles to maintain levels above the 50-day EMA line, encountering lower price rejections at the $0.85 psychological level. The 24-hour low remains at $0.86, while the crucial support, the center pivot line, is at $0.851. Cardano Price Chart With an intraday recovery, ADA is showing potential for a bounce back to an overhead resistance trendline, forming a falling wedge pattern. The Cardano price trend continues to hover above this critical level with lower price rejections from the center pivot line.This increases the likelihood of the altcoin reclaiming the $1 psychological level if the broader market recovers. Based on the current price action, the overhead resistance trendline aligns with the $1 mark, which could act as a key resistance level.In the event of a breakout rally, the Cardano price could target the $1.239 resistance level. On the other hand, the $0.85 support, combined with the local trendline, serves as a bullish floor.In the case of a bearish outcome, a breakdown could see the price retest the 100-day EMA line at $0.727, implying a downside risk of nearly 20%.Analyst Remains Optimistic, Targets $6Despite the short-term risk, independent analyst Ali Martinez has highlighted the possibility of Cardano reaching the $6 mark.However, in his tweet, he pointed out the likelihood of a major correction similar to the price action seen in 2020.Drawing a parallel to the 2020 bull run, Martinez believes that Cardano's price will likely undergo a significant correction following the current rally, much like what occurred during the previous cycle.With an optimistic price target of $6, he suggests that the ongoing correction could present a lucrative buy-the-dip opportunity for Cardano supporters.",NEUTRAL,ADA,ADA | ALTCOIN | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/23/cardano-price-analysis-will-ada-reclaim-1-after-a-bearish-weekend/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=cardano-price-analysis-will-ada-reclaim-1-after-a-bearish-weekend,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Bad actors have seemingly found a new way to exploit crypto users by sharing seed phrases, tricking victims into attempting to steal funds from a multi-signature wallet, only to fall victim to the scam themselves. In a blog post on Dec. 23, Russia’s sanctioned cybersecurity firm Kaspersky revealed a scam after a comment appeared under a finance YouTube video. The user shared their seed phrase and asked for help transferring funds from their wallet, which experts quickly flagged as suspicious. Binance founder Changpeng Zhao stated in an X post that receiving crypto through a private key or hardware wallet is a “bad idea,” citing “several instances” where this has occurred. https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1870843145971458058 A seed phrase is a unique sequence of words needed to access a cryptocurrency wallet, and sharing it openly can lead to theft. Kaspersky notes that the comment appeared to be from a beginner, with other similar comments following, all from “from newly created accounts.” These messages contained seed phrases and requests for assistance with fund transfers. In the scam, a thief accessing the wallet would find it filled with Tether’s ( USDT ). However, to withdraw the funds, the thief would need TRON ( TRX ). “Unfortunately, the wallet doesn’t have enough TRX, so the thief tries to transfer TRX from their own personal wallet — only to discover that the tokens they transferred immediately ended up in a completely different, third wallet.” Kaspersky You might also like: Kaspersky warns of new MacOS malware aiming at crypto wallets The trick lies in the wallet’s multi-signature setup, the analysts say, adding that this type of wallets requires approval from multiple parties to authorize transactions. As a result, even if the scammer paid the necessary fees, they would not be able to steal the funds. Kaspersky warned that this scam is an example of how scammers can manipulate thieves, encouraging users to avoid sharing seed phrases and to stay cautious of similar schemes. In June, the Biden administration imposed sanctions on 12 senior leaders at Kaspersky Lab, citing cybersecurity risks, a day after announcing plans to ban the sale of the Russian company’s antivirus software.

As a blockchain-AI innovator, LCAI is already catching attention for its transformative potential. Other frontrunners include Cardano (ADA), popular for its scalable architecture and dedicated community. Let’s explore why these three tokens are poised for significant growth. Cardano: A scalable and sustainable blockchain Cardano is still one of the best ͏plans in crypto world, because of its careful growth and aim at lastingness.

Its focus on AI integration, real-world utility, and a community-driven model make it a standout in the under-$1 category. For those looking to diversify their portfolio, a combination of LCAI, ADA, and new coins could provide a balanced mix of growth potential and stability. However, with its low presale price and groundbreaking features, Lightchain AI holds the most promise for exponential returns. Plus, with the increasing demand for decentralized AI solutions and the potential for advancements in healthcare, finance, and logistics, investing in LCAI now could prove to be a game-changer in the long run.

Unlike many low-priced tokens that rely solely on hype and speculation, LCAI has a clear use case and addresses a significant gap in the market. By bringing together two powerful technologies – blockchain and AI – LCAI offers a more robust, efficient, and decentralized solution for developers looking to integrate AI into their applications. Additionally, LCAI’s transparent governance model ensures that decisions are made with community input, fostering trust and inclusivity.

Daddy Pepe (DADDPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 11,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DADDPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Daddy Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Daddy Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Daddy Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Daddy Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Daddy Pepe by entering its contract address – 9UFnMabUe7wecdEEzAYPoQPZiuTJ1hTFpNz6qtsiB3FA – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DADDPEPE.

In a December 21 post on X, Saylor outlined a strategic plan to establish a Bitcoin reserve , promote digital asset innovation, and solidify the U.S. as a global leader in the digital economy. Saylor’s framework identifies six key categories within the digital asset space: digital commodities like Bitcoin, digital securities, digital currencies, digital tokens, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and asset-backed tokens. These categories aim to define clear roles for issuers, exchanges, and owners, ensuring transparent and accountable participation across the industry. Economic Impact of the Proposed Framework The proposed Bitcoin reserve lies at the heart of Saylor’s plan, with projections indicating it could create between $16 trillion and $81 trillion in wealth. By reducing issuance costs from millions to mere thousands of dollars and expanding market access from 4,000 public companies to 40 million businesses, the framework envisions a 21st-century capital markets renaissance. Saylor also highlights the potential for the U.S. dollar to emerge as the global reserve digital currency, propelling the expansion of global digital capital markets from $2 trillion to $280 trillion, with U.S. investors capturing the lion’s share. A notable aspect of the framework is its focus on efficiency and innovation, advocating for industry-led compliance mechanisms. The plan suggests capping compliance costs at 1% of assets for token issuance and 0.1% annually for maintenance, aiming to reduce friction and bureaucracy. Mixed Reactions While Saylor’s proposal has garnered attention for its ambitious scope, it has also faced criticism. Serial Bitcoin detractor Peter Schiff dismissed the idea as “complete bullshit,” arguing that it would weaken the dollar, increase national debt, and harm America’s credibility. Nevertheless, MicroStrategy, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin with over 439,000 BTC valued at more than $41 billion, remains a testament to Saylor’s unwavering confidence in the cryptocurrency’s potential. With an aggregate portfolio profit of 54%, according to SaylorTracker, the company showcases Bitcoin’s transformative financial power .

38003894,https://coinpedia.org/?p=396576,1734955762,"Whales Fuel BONK Surge, Monero Rallies Strong! Next Big Crypto?","The post Whales Fuel BONK Surge, Monero Rallies Strong! Next Big Crypto? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Out of ashes, a Phoenix shall rise. That’s probably the befitting quote that highlights Monero and BONK’s recent surge. BONK price is gaining traction again – a major listing and surging whale activities have pushed it to a new ATH. Monero, often under regulatory fire, has also shown signs of life with a 5.8% rally despite recent adversities. It’s even better for the new DeFi powerhouse, Lunex Network. Its ongoing presale surged powerfully by 300% after $5.4 million has been raised, thanks to its redefining DeFi revolution. Are these the next big crypto? Lunex Network leads DeFi At The Forefront In Presale. The Next Big Crypto? In a landscape where established crypto are making waves, the DeFi all-rounder and the next big crypto crown is taken away by Lunex Network. This hybrid exchange is not just entering the market—it’s rewriting the rules of trading by addressing the flaws that have long plagued both centralized and decentralized platforms. This alone supersedes BONK’s speculative fad and Monero’s regulatory battles. Lunex Network bridges the divide between CEXs and DEXs with a revolutionary hybrid model, delivering the best of both worlds. The tech is one of a kind, too. It offers unbeatable security from its Enclave-backed noncustodial asset management solution, institutional-grade liquidity, an enterprise-grade e-commerce solution for businesses, and up-to-date trading tools for traders. Nothing comes close, and it’s easy to see why analysts think it’s the next big crypto. Whale’s Big Buys And Major Listing Fuel BONK Surge BONK’s price has been surging on the tailwind of meme coins’ resurgence. Whale activity and a listing that put BONK’s price in the Asian market spotlight have propelled this Solana star to a new ATH. In a bold move, a high-profile whale poured $3.4 million USDC into acquiring a staggering 65.4 billion BONK tokens. The hefty snap-up that showcases investors’ confidence has boosted sentiment for the BONK price. Beyond this, BONK’s recent securing of a listing on South Korea’s Upbit exchange has also heightened trading activity. Open interest is up in the sky, too. BONK’s OI went from under $10 million to $60 million, and the sharp rise improved market participation. Monero Shows Signs Of Strength Despite Adversities. Dominance in adversity—that’s rare, but Monero is pulling that off. Its privacy-focused solution, which has been getting on regulatory and exchanges’ nerves, has defied bearish pressure. Despite regulatory hurdles and exchange delistings, Monero’s price blew up 5% to $160, marking an astonishing 15% rebound from its monthly lows. Privacy coins like Monero have long been targets of regulatory scrutiny. Kraken recently delisted the coin in compliance with MiCA. Yet, Monero’s advocates remain resilient. Technically, Monero shows promising signs of recovery. Conclusion As BONK price and Monero rally amid market optimism, Lunex Network is emerging as the true game-changer in the crypto world. Lunex Network is rewriting the DeFi playbook with its hybrid exchange model that bridges the best features of both CEXs and DEXs. This is paying off already! $5.4 million was raised in liquidity, and analysts are saying its 300% growth is just the beginning.

38003975,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=632230,1734955616,Bitcoin shows signs of maturity as BTC ends the year with the smallest drawdowns in any bull cycle,"Bitcoin (BTC) continued the 2024 bull cycle with the smallest drawdowns to date. The higher price range is less volatile, translating into much smaller expected crashes. Bitcoin had the smallest drawdowns as a fraction of its price during the 2024 bull run . As the year closes, the most dramatic slide for BTC happened when the leading coin erased 32% of its value. Cycle drawdowns usually require months of recovery, while smaller price fluctuations allow for the rallies to resume faster. Bitcoin (BTC) had the smallest drawdowns during the 2022-2024 bull cycle, but the past 12 months arrived with even lower volatility. | Source: Glassnode The August 5 drawdown was the record loss for the year, and in hindsight, the prime opportunity to buy the dip. Since then, BTC drawdowns and volatility have decreased further, with losses limited to 25%. BTC traded at $96,071.21 as of December 23, after a recent dip under $94,000. The leading coin retains a dominance of 57.3%, still retaining its lead over Ethereum (ETH). At the higher price range, drawdowns become even smaller, as most traders are avoiding panic-selling. The recent behavior is also due to the previous experience of seeing whales buying during every dip, absorbing more of the previous retail investments. The 2024 bull cycle outperformed while sustaining lower volatility The 2024 bull cycle started from a low of $16,000 and extended to a peak of $108,000. Later, BTC corrected under $95,000, but with no signs of a bigger drawdown. Traders were much more cautious in 2024, though leveraged positions were still liquidated periodically. The 2022-2024 bull cycle followed the previous 2019-2021 price range, which was one of the most dramatic in the history of Bitcoin. From 2019 onward, BTC attempted new all-time highs, but the rally was cut short by the uncertainty of the Covid-19 pandemic. The previous cycle started with lows of $4,000 and peaked above $61,000. Drawdowns during that cycle reached 61.8% during the days of the biggest market panic. After the post-pandemic period and the crash of FTX, Bitcoin trading became more mature, finding other sources of liquidity. The leading coin still managed to become the main narrative for the year, extending its dominance to over 70% of the crypto market capitalization. During the most recent bull cycle, BTC also found support from corporate buying, especially the involvement of MicroStrategy (MSTR) and other mining companies building up treasuries. The biggest factor sustaining a relatively low volatility for this bull cycle was also the inflow of stablecoins during periods of weakened price action. This time, Tether, Inc. did not allow bigger drawdowns, and whales also bought the dip. BTC also did not go for a freefall as ETF buyers joined the game, buying more coins on behalf of their investors. BlackRock built one of the biggest Bitcoin reserves, after constant inflows into its ETF. At the highest price range, some whales managed to realize profits, but the overall conviction is to hold BTC as a reserve coin for a jump to an even higher price range. Will BTC still have a big correction? The relatively low volatility raises questions on whether Bitcoin can return to a bear market and post a bigger drawdown. One long-term prediction is that BTC may slide as low as $85,000 from the $100,000 level before re-launching its 2025 bull market. BTC achieved 2% volatility on average, still allowing for dramatic price moves in the short term. The current BTC price based on the Rainbow chart is still in the accumulation range, with no indications of a market peak. This time around, traders are much more careful when allocating leveraged liquidity, which keeps the BTC price within a range. The biggest accumulation of liquidity is at around $93,660, potentially driving the price downward to liquidate those positions. The Bitcoin fear and greed index returned above 70 points, once again indicating greed. In 2024, the price moves near the BTC peak are more often caused by whale traders instead of a mix of FOMO and panic-selling. After even a small dip, greedy trading behavior returns, suggesting a short-term bullish outlook.

Solana ($SOL), Binance Coin ($BNB), and Theta Network ($THETA) are three likely candidates for breakouts. Total 3 chart (altcoins) analysis Source: TradingView Total 3 tracks the combined market cap of all cryptocurrencies except $BTC and $ETH. The 2-week chart shows that the combined market cap is still on target to achieve the measured move out of its cup and handle pattern (drawn in yellow). This suggests that altcoins have quite some way to go in order to attain this target of $1.29 trillion. It could also be borne in mind that a possible even bigger cup and handle pattern could be playing out, with the handle being formed right now. On the downside, the RSI at the bottom of the chart is showing that this current red 2-week candle has resulted in the indicator line being rejected from the descending trendline. This indicator line will definitely need to turn back up and break the descending trendline in order to reverse the downward trend. $SOL could be the first of the major altcoins to recover Source: TradingView Solana’s descent over these last few weeks has surprised many. A beautiful cup and handle pattern had broken to the upside, and all seemed very bright for the $SOL price going forward. However, the major support at $202 gave way and the price continued on down to finally be held up by good support at $176. This also coincides with the upward trendline. $SOL is currently up 2.3% on Monday so far, and has come up against the first horizontal resistance at $184. $SOL bulls will need to break this and then repeat this feat if the price can get back to the pivotal $202 major resistance. The Stochastic RSI (momentum indicator) on the weekly chart is fast returning to the bottom and a potential reset. Compared with $BTC and major altcoins, this indicator for $SOL is a lot more advanced, meaning that $SOL could start its main recovery before most. $BNB breakout or break of trend Source: TradingView The weekly chart for $BNB is very similar to that of $SOL, given that the upward trend is still in force. However, $BNB is at its breakout level right now. A band of very strong resistance stretches from $660 to $675, and the price is up against the upper of these resistances currently. $BNB will either now break out again, or the upward trend will be broken to the downside. The Stochastic RSI is on the way down, but not being as advanced as that of $SOL, the downward momentum could keep the price suppressed a while longer. $THETA bulls still have it all to do Source: TradingView Unlike $SOL and $BNB, the $THETA price is still a long, long way from its all-time high. With the bull market potentially in its last stage, this does not bode well for $THETA in the longer term. That said, the price is up 4.4% so far on Monday, bringing it to the major horizontal resistance at $2.25. Bulls need to push the price through this level and above the last local high at $3.80 in order for any kind of recovery to take place. Nevertheless, with the Stochastic RSI indicators on their way back down from the top, the likelihood of rejection is probably quite high. If this does take place, a lower low below $0.90 must be avoided. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Lunex Network is rapidly emerging as a prominent topic within the crypto sphere, overshadowing major cryptocurrencies with its robust profit prospects. While established altcoins struggle to maintain momentum, Lunex Network is experiencing a remarkable surge, offering substantial returns to investors in its ongoing presale. Enjoy DeFi’s Best Features With Lunex Network Lunex Network is positioning itself as the top crypto that delivers both real functionality and consistent profits for investors who are constantly on the hunt for features. Despite being a new altcoin, Lunex Network is already dominating the market with its DEX protocol designed to improve trading by addressing major challenges in the DeFi space. This protocol uses a unique aggregation technology to pull liquidity from multiple exchanges. This also ensures that trades can be split for the best prices. Additionally, Lunex Network possesses an advanced smart contract system that continuously verifies transactions, providing real-time information and enhancing the platform’s efficiency and security.

With LNEX, these holders get amazing staking rewards, and governance voting rights that lets them make decisions regarding the growth of the platform. NEAR Dips Following Current Market State The past month has been highly volatile for NEAR as it has fallen below its previous support zone of $6. After briefly rising from $5.5 to a little over $8 between November end and the first week of December, NEAR is now struggling to maintain a price above $5.5. NEAR trading at around that mark shows a 5.14% decline in the past month and a huge 22.72% decline in a smaller time frame. While many analysts have attributed this fall to the current state of the market, NEAR investors are hopeful that this price trend doesn’t last for too long. Could Recent Fall Cause RNDR to Lose Investor Attention? Like NEAR, RNDR has also been on a downtrend lately. According to Render price charts, RNDR fell drastically from an impressive $9.33 to around $7.30, where it has been trading recently. This represents a decline of over 21%, raising concerns among RNDR investors about the token’s price trajectory leading into 2025. Some investors suspect that RNDR’s token name rebrand to RENDER (and move to Solana from Ethereum) could be a contributing factor to this fall. Despite their worries, there is still a bit of optimism among RNDR investors who are banking on the bullish sentiment around the upcoming United States Presidential swearing-in to boost the official Render price. Conclusion While old-timer cryptos like NEAR and RNDR are fading, the new Lunex Network is steadily making its way to the top of the crypto market. Its live presale, where LNEX tokens are valued at $0.0048 , is the main boost to this growth trend. Having already raised over $5.4 million through the presale, there is no doubt that Lunex Network will become a market giant in no time.

38004217,https://cryptonews.com/?p=321904,1734955092,Botswana’s Central Bank Calls for Crypto Regulations to Stay Ahead of Future Risks,"Botswana’s central bank has called for crypto regulations to mitigate future risks, even though the local cryptocurrency market remains relatively underdeveloped and poses “minimal” risks to financial stability at present. In its latest Financial Stability Report , the Bank of Botswana acknowledged the increasing interconnectedness between the crypto market and traditional financial systems globally, warning of potential systemic risks. Systemic risks refer to the cascading failures that can occur within the financial system, potentially triggering broader economic instability. Botswana Calls for Crypto Regulations The central bank of Botswana said regulators “need to develop effective oversight frameworks for the sector.” “Domestically, risks emanating from crypto assets are minimal but ongoing misconduct in the segment presents regulatory concerns.” While the bank noted that Botswana’s virtual asset market is still in its infancy and relatively unsophisticated, posing limited threats to financial stability, it also identified broader concerns tied to financial technology innovations. As tech adoption grows, these risks are expected to increase, requiring proactive measures. A key concern raised by the bank is the use of digital payment instruments, including cryptocurrencies, for money laundering and terrorist financing. It identified the anonymity provided by digital platforms as a significant factor enabling illicit activities and flagged this issue as one of the top five national security risks emanating from the financial sector. “The evolution of digital platforms and digital payment instruments that promote anonymity of transactions present an opportunity for money laundering in the financial sector,” the bank stated, adding that advanced financial technologies make it easier to transmit illicit funds. To address these challenges, the Bank of Botswana called for regulatory oversight to ensure that virtual asset service providers, such as crypto exchanges, comply with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter Financing of Terrorism (CFT) regulations. Why #Crypto needs regulation #memecoin #hawktuah pic.twitter.com/Xvos4guTKj — Evan Kirstel #B2B #TechFluencer (@EvanKirstel) December 22, 2024 The bank also recommended enhanced market surveillance and collaboration with law enforcement as strategies to detect and prevent illegal activities. More Countries Push for Crypto Regulations Botswana’s call for crypto regulations comes as more countries are announcing new rules for crypto companies. Just recently, Taiwan announced that it is set to implement its new AML regulations for crypto businesses following fines issued to two exchanges for compliance breaches. The Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) announced in November that the deadline for mandatory AML registration for virtual asset service providers (VASPs) has been moved up to November 30, 2024, from the previous January 1, 2025, timeline. Likewise, the United Kingdom plans to introduce a comprehensive regulatory framework for the cryptocurrency sector early next year. During a London conference last month, Economic Secretary to the Treasury Tulip Siddiq said that the proposed framework will consolidate regulations for stablecoins and staking services under one unified regime. Meanwhile, cryptocurrency enforcement in the United States may ease under the upcoming administration of Republican President-elect Donald Trump, with regulatory priorities expected to shift.

The latest dip, however, extended its weekly losses to almost 22%. This prompted many whales to accumulate the token. LINK Whales’ Conviction There has been a noticeable uptick in the holdings of wallets containing between 10 million and 100 million LINK coins, rising from approximately 475.79 million to 479.78 million within a short period. According to popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez, this translates to a purchase of over $44 million worth of LINK, which reflects bullish behavior among large holders during the price retracement. The accumulation trend suggests growing confidence in LINK’s long-term potential. Lookonchain’s recent tweet further validated the strong conviction among whales. The blockchain analytics platform identified nine fresh wallets withdrawing a total of 362,380 LINK tokens, which is worth around $8.19 million, from Binance within the last 48 hours. Before the recent market turmoil, the LINK token saw a significant price increase and a boost in market activity, attributed to World Liberty Financial (WLFI) – a project backed by Donald Trump’s family – strategically increasing its holdings. This wave of renewed interest has led to a sharp rise in market activity. As such, CoinCodex has predicted that Chainlink’s price will increase by more than 53%, potentially reaching $35.56 by January 22, 2025. The market sentiment remains Neutral, while the Fear & Greed Index stands at 70 (Greed). In the past 30 days, Chainlink had 16 green days out of 30, with a volatility of 17.48%. Chainlink Leads Real-World Assets (RWA) Sector Earlier this month, market intelligence platform Santiment reported that Chainlink is at the forefront of the real-world assets (RWA) sector in terms of development activity. Its analysis highlighted that the decentralized oracle network is leading the sector, followed by Synthetix (SNX), a synthetic asset platform based on Ethereum, and Dusk Foundation (DUSK), which focuses on privacy and tokenization. According to the data, Chainlink recorded nearly 394 significant GitHub events in the last 30 days, while Synthetix and Dusk Foundation had 176.6 and 34.7, respectively. Besides, Chainlink has partnered with leading companies such as Coinbase, SWIFT, UBS, and Emirates NBD for the RWA tokenization industry.

38003391,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=113382,1734954728,AI Website: The Future of Web Development and User Experience,"AI Website: The Future of Web Development and User Experience The internet is constantly evolving, and so are the tools and technologies that power websites. One of the most significant technological advancements in recent years is the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in web development. AI websites are transforming how websites are designed, how users interact with them, and how businesses optimize their online presence. From personalized user experiences to automated customer support , AI is enhancing website functionality in ways that were previously unimaginable. In this article, we’ll explore how AI is reshaping web development , the benefits of AI-powered websites , and how businesses can leverage AI technologies to improve user engagement and streamline operations. Whether you’re a web developer, business owner, or curious about AI’s role in web design, this guide will provide you with a comprehensive understanding of the growing impact of AI on the world of websites . What is an AI Website? An AI website is a website that incorporates artificial intelligence technologies to improve functionality, user experience, and automation. AI enables websites to perform tasks that require human-like intelligence, such as personalization , natural language processing , predictive analytics , and automation . Rather than simply being static web pages, AI-powered websites can adjust their content dynamically, interact with visitors in real time, and offer personalized experiences based on user behavior and preferences. AI can analyze large amounts of data, make decisions based on that data, and improve over time with machine learning, creating a more efficient, engaging, and intuitive user experience. How Does AI Work on Websites? AI’s functionality on websites is largely driven by advanced algorithms, machine learning, and data processing. AI tools and platforms can be integrated into websites in various ways to enhance their capabilities. Here are some key areas where AI is used on websites: Personalization : One of the most common applications of AI on websites is personalization . By analyzing user behavior and collecting data on previous interactions, AI can tailor website content to individual users. For example, an e-commerce site might use AI to recommend products based on a user’s previous purchases or browsing history. AI can personalize the content, layout, and even the calls to action based on real-time data, making the user experience more relevant and engaging. Chatbots and Virtual Assistants : AI-powered chatbots are becoming an integral part of many websites. These bots are designed to simulate conversation with users and can handle customer queries, provide recommendations, and resolve common issues. AI chatbots can answer questions, direct users to relevant pages, and even assist in completing purchases or processing orders. Virtual assistants like Siri and Google Assistant are also examples of AI-driven tools that help users interact with websites through voice commands. Predictive Analytics : AI websites often use predictive analytics to anticipate user behavior and needs. By analyzing past behavior, AI can forecast what users might want or need next. For instance, a news website might use predictive analytics to recommend articles that users are likely to find interesting based on their reading history. Predictive analytics can also help businesses optimize their content, ensuring the most relevant information is presented to users at the right time.

38003361,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=113378,1734954621,What is Forex? A Comprehensive Guide to the World of Forex Trading,"What is Forex? A Comprehensive Guide to the World of Forex Trading If you’ve ever wondered about the term “ Forex ” or “ foreign exchange ,” you’re not alone. Forex refers to the world’s largest financial market, where currencies are traded against one another. The forex market plays a crucial role in international trade and investments, with trillions of dollars being exchanged daily. Whether you are an aspiring trader, a business owner, or just someone looking to understand this dynamic market, this guide will provide you with a deep understanding of what Forex is , how it works, and how people can trade currencies for profit. In this article, we’ll cover everything you need to know about Forex trading , including key concepts, how to get started, and tips for success. Let’s dive in! What is Forex? Forex , also known as foreign exchange or FX , is the global marketplace for buying and selling currencies . Unlike other markets such as stocks or commodities , the Forex market operates 24 hours a day, five days a week, allowing traders worldwide to exchange currencies at any given time. The Forex market is decentralized, meaning it doesn’t have a central exchange like the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) . Instead, it operates through a network of banks , financial institutions , brokers , and individual traders who exchange currencies electronically over-the-counter (OTC). The main goal of Forex trading is to speculate on the price movements of one currency relative to another. This is done by buying one currency while simultaneously selling another. The aim is to profit from the difference in exchange rates between the two currencies. How Does Forex Work? To understand how Forex works, let’s break down the key elements that make up the Forex market. Currency Pairs Forex trading involves trading currency pairs . A currency pair consists of two currencies: the base currency and the quote currency . For example, in the currency pair EUR/USD , the Euro (EUR) is the base currency, and the U.S. Dollar (USD) is the quote currency. When you buy this pair, you are buying Euros while selling U.S. Dollars . Conversely, when you sell the pair, you are selling Euros and buying U.S. Dollars . The price of a currency pair indicates how much of the quote currency is needed to buy one unit of the base currency . Exchange Rates Exchange rates are the value at which one currency can be exchanged for another. They fluctuate constantly based on various factors, including interest rates , economic data , geopolitical events , and market sentiment . For instance, if the EUR/USD exchange rate is 1.2000, this means 1 Euro is worth 1.20 U.S. Dollars . If this rate changes to 1.2500, the Euro has appreciated relative to the Dollar , and the exchange rate has increased. Leverage Leverage in Forex trading allows traders to control a large position in the market with a relatively small initial investment (called margin). For example, with 50:1 leverage , a trader can control a position worth $50,000 with just $1,000 of their own capital. While leverage can amplify profits, it also increases the risk, as traders can incur substantial losses if the market moves against them. Market Participants The Forex market is made up of several key participants, including: Central Banks : These institutions control a country’s monetary policy and influence currency values through interest rate changes and foreign exchange interventions. Commercial Banks : Large banks provide liquidity and facilitate currency transactions for their clients. Retail Traders : Individual traders who engage in Forex trading for personal profit. Hedge Funds and Investment Firms : These entities also trade currencies to manage risk or seek profit. Market Sessions The Forex market operates 24 hours a day, with trading sessions opening and closing in different parts of the world. These include the Sydney , Tokyo , London , and New York sessions. The overlap between these sessions creates periods of higher liquidity and volatility. The Asian session is typically less volatile, while the London and New York sessions experience the highest trading volume and price movements. Types of Forex Markets There are three primary types of Forex markets where trading takes place: Spot Market The spot market is where currencies are bought and sold for immediate delivery, typically within two business days. This is the most common market for retail traders . Forward Market The forward market involves contracts to buy or sell currencies at a specific future date and price. These contracts are customizable and traded over-the-counter (OTC), typically by businesses looking to hedge currency risk. Futures Market In the futures market , currency contracts are standardized and traded on exchanges like the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) . These contracts are similar to forward contracts , but they are more regulated and can be bought or sold before their expiration date. Why is Forex So Popular? Liquidity The Forex market is the most liquid market in the world, with daily trading volumes surpassing $6 trillion . This means that orders can be filled quickly, and there is always a buyer or seller available. Accessibility Forex trading is open to anyone with an internet connection and access to a broker. Unlike stock trading , which requires buying shares in a company, Forex trading allows you to speculate on the movement of currencies without owning the underlying asset. Leverage Leverage is one of the most attractive aspects of Forex trading. It enables traders to control larger positions in the market with a smaller amount of capital, increasing their potential for profit (and loss). Diverse Trading Opportunities Forex provides opportunities to trade a wide range of currencies, including major , minor , and exotic pairs . This allows traders to take advantage of fluctuations in a wide variety of markets and time zones. 24-Hour Trading The ability to trade 24 hours a day across different time zones gives Forex traders flexibility and the ability to react quickly to market events and news. How to Get Started with Forex Trading Choose a Reliable Forex Broker The first step in Forex trading is to choose a regulated Forex broker that offers low spreads , high leverage , and a user-friendly platform . Make sure the broker is licensed by a reputable financial authority, such as CySEC , ASIC , or the FCA . Open a Trading Account Once you have chosen your broker, you can open a trading account . Most brokers offer different types of accounts (such as micro or standard accounts), so you can choose one that suits your trading style and budget. Start with a Demo Account Before risking real money, it’s advisable to start with a demo account . This will allow you to practice trading with virtual funds and get familiar with the trading platform. Develop a Trading Strategy Successful Forex trading requires a solid trading strategy . Whether you prefer technical analysis , fundamental analysis , or a combination of both, having a well-thought-out plan is key to managing risk and maximizing profits. Monitor the Market Stay informed about economic indicators , global events , and market sentiment that can affect currency values. Using news feeds , charts , and technical indicators will help you make more informed decisions. Risks of Forex Trading Forex trading can be highly profitable, but it also comes with significant risks . The use of leverage can amplify both profits and losses. It’s essential to use risk management tools , such as stop-loss orders , to protect your capital. Additionally, it’s crucial to stay disciplined and avoid emotional trading decisions. Conclusion Forex trading is a dynamic and highly liquid market that offers numerous opportunities for traders around the world. Whether you’re a beginner looking to explore the market or an experienced trader looking for new opportunities, understanding the fundamentals of Forex trading is crucial. By choosing the right broker, developing a solid strategy, and continuously educating yourself, you can succeed in the Forex market . If you’re ready to dive into the world of Forex trading , make sure to do thorough research and practice responsible trading. Forex may seem complex, but with the right knowledge and approach, you can make the most of this exciting market.

At this point, while Trump is expected to take office as president, ETF Store president Nate Geraci revealed an interesting situation regarding Dogecoin (DOGE). Pointing out that no fund manager has so far applied to the SEC for a spot Dogecoin ETF, Geraci expressed his curiosity as to who will be the first to apply for DOGE. Responding to this post, Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said that the Dogecoin ETF application will be awaited after US President-elect Donald Trump takes office. The analyst added that Trump’s inauguration would set a precedent for investment fund managers to apply for a spot Dogecoin ETF. Finally, Balchunas stated that Paul Atkins’ appointment as SEC chairman would significantly increase the chances of crypto ETFs being approved. “I agree. I thought someone would file for a Dogecoin ETF by Christmas. But now we can wait until Atkins and Trump are inaugurated.” Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to trade at $0.31 at the time of writing. https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas/status/1870996999782437071 *This is not investment advice.

38003348,https://coinpaper.com/6684/bitcoin-records-first-major-weekly-loss-after-trump-s-election-rally,1734954606,Bitcoin Records First Major Weekly Loss After Trump's Election Rally,"Despite this setback, people are still optimistic about Bitcoin and predict it could still surge to $200,000 by 2025 due to institutional adoption and favorable regulatory shifts under the incoming administration. Japanese firm Metaplanet capitalized on the dip with a record $60 million Bitcoin purchase, while social sentiment hit a 2024 low. Long-term Bitcoin prospects are also still quite positive, bolstered by strategic proposals like a U.S. Bitcoin reserve that could cut national debt. Bitcoin Retreats from All-Time Highs Bitcoin experienced its first big weekly decline since Donald Trump’s November presidential election win started a rally that propelled the cryptocurrency past six figures. Over the week ending Dec. 22, Bitcoin dropped by 10%, closing at $94,645 after starting the week at close to $105,185. This decline erased approximately $10,500 from its price. Bitcoin price action over the past week (Source: CoinMarketCap ) The downturn coincided with the Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Market Committee decision to reduce the number of projected interest rate cuts for the coming year, trimming expectations from five to just two. The federal funds rate is now expected to peak at 3.9% in 2025, compared to the previously forecasted 3.4%, creating a less favorable environment for risk-on assets like Bitcoin. Before this decline, Bitcoin showed consistent strength by rising in six of the past seven weekly closes since Trump’s election. The only exception was a minor 0.78% retracement during the week ending Nov. 24. Bitcoin weekly price history (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Despite this recent pullback, optimism for Bitcoin’s long-term prospects is still strong. Asset management firms like Bitwise and VanEck predict the cryptocurrency could surge to the $180,000 to $200,000 range by 2025, driven by a potential U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve and increased institutional and corporate adoption. Trump’s administration is also expected to create a much more favorable regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies. Some of Trump’s key appointments include hedge fund manager Scott Bessent as Secretary of Treasury and Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick as Commerce Department head. Crypto advocate Paul Atkins is also set to replace Gary Gensler as chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission on Jan. 20. Atkins is a former SEC commissioner, and is anticipated to bring a more pro-crypto stance to the agency. At press time, Bitcoin was trading hands at $95,303.85 after its price dropped by 1.35% over the past 24 hours. This is a dramatic increase from its position on Christmas Day last year when it was valued at approximately $43,600. Metaplanet Makes Record Bitcoin Purchase Japanese investment firm Metaplanet certainly took advantage of Bitcoin’s price dip by making its largest-ever Bitcoin purchase. The firm bought 619.7 BTC for nearly $60 million. The purchase was announced on Dec. 23, and was made at an approximate price of $96,000 per Bitcoin. Metaplanet’s previous record buy was 159.7 BTC in October. This latest acquisition brought Metaplanet’s total Bitcoin holdings to 1,762 BTC, which is valued at around $168 million, with an average purchase price of $75,600 per Bitcoin. Metaplanet’s latest purchase also makes its Bitcoin holdings the 12th-largest among public companies, trailing behind medical technology firm Semler Scientific. The company also reported some very impressive returns on its Bitcoin strategy, with a BTC Yield of 310% between October and December. This exceeded the 41.7% yield achieved in the previous quarter by far. Metaplanet uses BTC Yield as a metric to evaluate the success of its Bitcoin acquisition strategy, which it claims adds value for shareholders. In an investor disclosure, Metaplanet revealed plans to formalize Bitcoin acquisition and management as a core business line. This initiative will include leveraging financial instruments like loans, equity, and convertible bonds to accumulate and manage Bitcoin holdings. The firm also announced its plan to raise more than $62 million through a stock acquisition program to expand its Bitcoin treasury even more. On Dec. 18, Metaplanet projected its first operating profit since 2017. The announcement triggered a 5% surge in the company’s stock price on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, although shares are still down almost 13% over the past week. Despite its recent fluctuations, Metaplanet’s stock skyrocketed by more than 2,100% this year, driven by its embrace of Bitcoin. Bitcoin Sentiment Hits 2024 Low Social sentiment around Bitcoin also recently plummeted to its lowest level in 2024, which raised some speculation about a potential recovery above the $100,000 mark. Bitcoin’s correction has been accompanied by a sharp decline in retail sentiment, with a ratio of four to five positive versus negative Bitcoin-related comments on social media. Despite the negative sentiment, some market analysts see this as an indicator of an incoming Bitcoin breakout. Market intelligence platform Santiment pointed out that fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) among vocal traders could signal a market move contrary to retail expectations. Other analysts agree with this sentiment, and suggested that the end of Bitcoin’s current correction phase under $100,000 is near. Emerging fractal patterns on Bitcoin’s daily chart point to the possibility of an imminent recovery above $100,000. Analyst Elja Boom noticed the similarities to previous patterns, and suggested a short-term reversal could be in play. However, historical data indicates that Bitcoin’s correction might continue for another week. Analyst Rekt Capital referenced prior market cycles where corrective phases extended through multiple weeks. Looking further ahead, Bitcoin’s outlook for 2025 still appears more optimistic. Matrixport , a crypto services provider, predicts that improving macroeconomic conditions and easing global monetary policies could propel Bitcoin’s price above $160,000 by the end of next year. U.S. Bitcoin Reserve Could Cut National Debt Meanwhile, the United States could greatly reduce its national debt by creating a Bitcoin reserve, according to a report by asset management firm VanEck. The analysis suggests that holding 1 million Bitcoin could offset approximately 35% of the national debt by 2049, assuming Bitcoin’s price grows at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 25%. Under this scenario, Bitcoin’s value would reach $42.3 million per coin by 2049, while the national debt is projected to rise from $37 trillion in 2025 to $119.3 trillion at a 5% CAGR over the same period. VanEck’s projection started with Bitcoin at $200,000 in 2025, more than double its current trading price of $95,360. The firm expects that Bitcoin’s value could expand to represent 18% of global financial assets by 2049, which is a big increase from its current 0.22% share of the $900 trillion market. (Source: VanEck ) This proposal aligns with a bill that was introduced by Senator Cynthia Lummis, which advocates for the U.S. to establish a Bitcoin reserve. While Donald Trump’s incoming administration has shared its interest in using Bitcoin as a reserve asset, Lummis’ bill still has to be reviewed by Congress. Strike CEO Jack Mallers even speculated that Trump might issue an executive order on his first day in office to designate Bitcoin as a reserve asset. Under the Lummis plan, the U.S. could take advantage of the 198,100 Bitcoin that it currently holds from asset seizures and acquire the remaining 801,900 Bitcoin through Emergency Support Functions, selling a portion of its $455 billion gold reserves, or a combination of both. This strategy would not involve money printing or taxpayer funds, according to VanEck. VanEck also mentioned how Bitcoin’s adoption at the state, institutional, and corporate levels could accelerate its growth even more. The firm’s analysts, Matthew Sigel and Nathan Frankovitz, suggested that Bitcoin’s potential role as a settlement currency in global trade could drive its adoption, especially among BRICS nations looking to bypass U.S. sanctions. In this context, Bitcoin’s broader use as a global settlement currency could reshape its role in international finance completely and contribute to its projected growth trajectory.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6684/bitcoin-records-first-major-weekly-loss-after-trump-s-election-rally,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

38003463,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=632216,1734954497,OpenAI to advance o1 and o3 AI models with new safety training paradigm,"On Friday, OpenAI announced the release of a new family of AI models, dubbed o3. The company claims the new products are more advanced than its previous models, including o1. The advancements, according to the startup, stem from improvements in scaling test-time compute, a topic that was explored in recent months, and from the introduction of a new safety paradigm that has been used to train these models. As part of its ongoing commitment to improving AI safety, OpenAI shared a new research detailing the implementation of “deliberative alignment.” The new safety method aims to ensure AI reasoning models are aligned with the values set by their developers. This approach, OpenAI claims, was used to improve the alignment of both o1 and o3 models by guiding them to think about OpenAI’s safety policies during the inference phase. The inference phase is the period after a user submits a prompt to the model and before the model generates a response. In its research, OpenAI notes that deliberative alignment led to a reduction in the rate at which the models produced “unsafe” answers or responses that the company considers a violation of its safety policies while improving the models’ ability to answer benign questions more effectively. How deliberative alignment works At its core, the process works by having the models re-prompt themselves during the chain-of-thought phase. After a user submits a question to ChatGPT, for example, the AI reasoning models take anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes to break down the problem into smaller steps. The models then generate an answer based on their thought process. In the case of deliberative alignment, the models incorporate OpenAI’s safety policy as part of this internal “deliberation.” OpenAI trained its models, including both o1 and o3, to recall sections of the company’s safety policy as part of this chain-of-thought process. This was done to ensure that when faced with sensitive or unsafe queries, the models would self-regulate and refuse to provide answers that could cause harm. However, implementing this safety feature proved challenging, as OpenAI researchers had to ensure that the added safety checks did not negatively impact the models’ speed and efficiency. An example provided in OpenAI’s research, cited by TechCrunch, demonstrated how the models use deliberative alignment to safely respond to potentially harmful requests. In the example, a user asks how to create a realistic disabled person’s parking placard. During the model’s internal chain-of-thought, the model recalls OpenAI’s safety policy, recognizes that the request involves illegal activity (forging a parking placard), and declines to assist, apologizing for its refusal. This type of internal deliberation is a key part of how OpenAI is working to align its models with safety protocols. Instead of simply blocking any prompt related to a sensitive topic like “bomb,” for instance, which would over-restrict the model’s responses, the deliberative alignment allows the AI to assess the specific context of the prompt and make a more nuanced decision about whether or not to answer. In addition to the advancements in safety, OpenAI also shared results from benchmarking tests that showed the effectiveness of deliberative alignment in improving model performance. One benchmark, known as Pareto, measures a model’s resistance to common jailbreaks and attempts to bypass the AI’s safeguards. In these tests, OpenAI’s o1-preview model outperformed other popular models such as GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Flash, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet in terms of avoiding unsafe outputs. Italy’s data protection authority fines OpenAI for privacy violations In a separate but related development, OpenAI was fined 15 million euros ($15.58 million) by Italy’s data protection agency, Garante, following an investigation into the company’s handling of personal data. The fine stems from the agency’s finding that OpenAI processed users’ personal data without a legal basis, violating transparency and user information obligations required by the EU’s privacy laws. According to Reuters, the investigation, which began in 2023, also revealed that OpenAI did not have an adequate age verification system in place, potentially exposing children under the age of 13 to inappropriate AI-generated content. Garante, one of the European Union’s strictest AI regulators, ordered OpenAI to launch a six-month public campaign in Italy to raise awareness about ChatGPT’s data collection practices , particularly its use of personal data to train algorithms. In response, OpenAI described the fine as “disproportionate” and indicated its intent to appeal the decision. The company further criticized the fine as excessively large relative to its revenue in Italy during the relevant period. Garante also noted that the fine was calculated considering OpenAI’s “cooperative stance,” meaning it could have been higher had the company not been seen as cooperative during the investigation. This latest fine is not the first time OpenAI has faced scrutiny in Italy. Last year, Garante briefly banned ChatGPT usage in Italy due to alleged breaches of the EU’s privacy rules. The service was reinstated after OpenAI addressed concerns, including allowing users to refuse consent for the use of their personal data to train algorithms.

38003291,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=113372,1734954492,Michael Saylor to Jeff Bezos: “$600M Would Buy a Lot of Bitcoin”,"Michael Saylor to Jeff Bezos: “$600M Would Buy a Lot of Bitcoin” In a light-hearted yet pointed response on X (formerly Twitter), Michael Saylor , the co-founder of MicroStrategy , suggested to Jeff Bezos that the $600 million rumored to be spent on his wedding could be better utilized in purchasing Bitcoin . Saylor’s comment came shortly after Bezos publicly denied rumors that he intended to spend $600 million on his wedding to fiancée Lauren Sanchez in Aspen, Colorado . The Context Behind the Remark The comment from Saylor emerged as a playful exchange in the wake of a widespread rumor about Bezos’ wedding expenses . Reports had surfaced claiming that Bezos, the Amazon founder , was planning to spend $600 million on his upcoming wedding, a claim he swiftly denied. In response, Michael Saylor , who has long been an advocate for Bitcoin , made a remark suggesting that instead of spending such a significant sum on a wedding, Bezos could potentially use the funds to acquire Bitcoin , an asset that Saylor has consistently championed as a store of value and hedge against inflation. Saylor’s response not only highlights his unwavering belief in Bitcoin as a superior investment but also reflects his ongoing efforts to promote Bitcoin adoption among the world’s most prominent business leaders and investors. The Power of $600 Million in Bitcoin Saylor’s suggestion that $600 million could “ buy a lot of Bitcoin ” emphasizes the current price of Bitcoin and how much value could be accumulated through a significant investment in the cryptocurrency. At Bitcoin’s current price (as of December 2024), $600 million would indeed allow for the purchase of a substantial amount of Bitcoin , further bolstering Saylor’s argument that Bitcoin is a smart long-term investment. Given that Bitcoin has steadily gained recognition as a store of value akin to gold , many investors have seen it as a way to preserve and grow wealth, especially in a world of increasing fiat currency printing and economic instability . Michael Saylor’s Advocacy for Bitcoin Michael Saylor has been a vocal supporter of Bitcoin for years. As the CEO of MicroStrategy , a business intelligence firm, Saylor has made his company one of the largest institutional holders of Bitcoin . MicroStrategy currently holds over 124,000 BTC , worth billions of dollars, making Saylor one of the most prominent figures in the crypto space advocating for the integration of Bitcoin into corporate balance sheets. Saylor has frequently argued that Bitcoin offers unparalleled potential as an inflation hedge and an asset that can outperform traditional forms of currency and bonds . His personal and professional investments in Bitcoin serve as a strong endorsement of the asset, and his comment to Bezos reflects his ongoing campaign to persuade other influential figures and companies to consider Bitcoin as a core component of their investment strategy. Jeff Bezos and Bitcoin: A Potential Future? While Jeff Bezos has not publicly commented on Saylor’s suggestion , his response to the wedding rumors makes clear that the $600 million figure is not intended for lavish expenses. However, the conversation has opened the door to speculation about Bezos’ potential involvement in Bitcoin . Bezos, as one of the world’s wealthiest individuals and a pioneer of the e-commerce and tech industries , has the means and the platform to make a significant impact on the cryptocurrency space . While there is no indication that Bezos is currently invested in Bitcoin , the growing adoption of cryptocurrencies among institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals suggests that he may, at some point, consider incorporating Bitcoin into his financial portfolio. Bitcoin as a Strategic Asset for High-Profile Investors Michael Saylor’s comments underscore a larger trend where prominent business leaders, investors, and institutional players are increasingly looking to Bitcoin as a strategic asset. As traditional investment avenues like stocks and bonds face pressures from inflation and monetary policy changes , Bitcoin offers a potential alternative that is more resistant to inflationary pressures and currency devaluation . The idea that $600 million could buy a significant amount of Bitcoin is part of the ongoing conversation about institutional adoption and the growing importance of digital assets in global finance. The question now is how many other business leaders and billionaires will follow Saylor’s lead and begin considering Bitcoin as a cornerstone of their investment strategies . Conclusion: A Playful Yet Powerful Bitcoin Suggestion Michael Saylor’s comment to Jeff Bezos that $600 million could buy a lot of Bitcoin serves as both a playful remark and a reminder of the growing influence of Bitcoin in the financial world. While Bezos may not be planning to invest in Bitcoin anytime soon, Saylor’s advocacy for Bitcoin remains steadfast, and his suggestion to Bezos further highlights the cryptocurrency’s potential as an investment vehicle. As Bitcoin continues to gain recognition as a long-term asset and inflation hedge , it is likely that more business leaders and investors will consider incorporating Bitcoin into their financial portfolios, just as MicroStrategy has done.

38003967,https://invezz.com/?p=2400684,1734954421,Botswana central bank pushes for crypto oversight despite limited risks,"The central bank of the South African nation of Botswana says cryptocurrencies pose limited risks to its economic stability but has advocated for measures to regulate the sector. According to the Bank of Botswana, the domestic virtual asset market remains small and relatively unsophisticated and, hence, doesn’t pose an immediate threat to the nation’s financial well-being. However, the rapid evolution of global crypto markets and the increasing integration of the crypto sector with traditional financial systems could introduce systemic risks over time. In its latest Financial Stability Report , the central bank warned that these risks, if left unchecked, might cascade into broader economic vulnerabilities. Despite the current limited exposure, the central bank stressed the importance of preemptive action, calling for tailored oversight frameworks that address market misconduct alongside other risks such as money laundering and terrorist financing fuelled by anonymous crypto transactions. It noted: Domestically, risks emanating from crypto assets are minimal, but ongoing misconduct in the segment presents regulatory concerns. Regulators, therefore, need to develop effective oversight frameworks for the sector. Money laundering using digital payment channels was flagged as a major concern for Bostwanan, with the central bank warning that the anonymity offered by certain digital platforms creates fertile ground for illicit financial flows. These channels, the bank noted, enable funds to be moved across borders with “relatively low detection risks,” complicating efforts to trace and intercept suspicious transactions. To mitigate such activities, the central bank urged the creation of clear rules to improve market monitoring and strengthen cooperation between financial regulators and law enforcement agencies. Further, it also wants regulators to ensure that Virtual Asset Service Providers are fully compliant with Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing regulations. Cryptocurrencies and money laundering Cryptocurrencies, due to their pseudonymous nature and decentralised structure, have long been criticised for their role in facilitating money laundering, fraud, and other illicit activities. This has led to increased enforcement actions , the introduction of stricter regulatory measures , and the updating of existing laws to better address the evolving risks posed by digital assets. While the Central Bank of Botswana acknowledged these risks, its assessment was notably more measured compared to the urgent warnings and stricter stances often seen across other jurisdictions. For instance, in September, law enforcement in Sweden labelled some cryptocurrency exchanges as “professional money launderers” for allowing illicit transactions after initiating an investigation into unlicensed platforms. The country’s Financial Market Supervisory Authority had previously sounded the alarm on the rising misuse of digital assets, particularly stablecoins, in fueling cyberattacks, illegal dark web transactions, and sanctions evasion tied to geopolitical conflicts. Last month, the Eurasian Group on Combating Money Laundering issued a similar warning, highlighting that bad actors were increasingly taking the crypto path to obscure financial trails and launder illicit funds using fake identities and multi-layered transactions across several platforms.

38003152,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=113368,1734954245,Bitcoin Archive Debunks UAE’s Alleged $40B Bitcoin Purchase as Fake News,"Bitcoin Archive Debunks UAE’s Alleged $40B Bitcoin Purchase as Fake News Bitcoin Archive , a prominent X account that specializes in Bitcoin (BTC) news and analysis, has recently refuted claims that the United Arab Emirates (UAE) purchased $40 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) . According to a post from Bitcoin Archive , the claim, which has been circulating widely across crypto news outlets and even shared by Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) on X , is a false rumor without credible sources or supporting evidence. Bitcoin Archive pointed out that the supposed $40 billion Bitcoin acquisition by the UAE appears to be a baseless claim, one that originated from an anonymous source and has now been mistakenly accepted as fact. The lack of verifiable links , supporting documentation, or search results further invalidates the claim, leading Bitcoin Archive to label it as fake news . The Rumor’s Spread Across Crypto Platforms The rumor about the UAE’s massive Bitcoin purchase gained traction quickly after it was initially shared on X , the platform previously known as Twitter. It was further amplified when Changpeng Zhao (CZ) , the CEO of Binance , posted about the alleged $40 billion Bitcoin acquisition . This connection between the claim and a high-profile figure in the crypto space may have contributed to the rapid spread of the rumor, with many in the crypto community believing it to be true. However, Bitcoin Archive emphasized that while Binance’s CZ shared the information, the claim lacked any official documentation , public announcements , or reliable sources to back it up. The absence of such credible evidence, according to Bitcoin Archive, makes it clear that the story should be regarded with skepticism. Lack of Sources and Supporting Evidence One of the key reasons Bitcoin Archive dismissed the UAE’s alleged $40 billion Bitcoin purchase as fake news was the absence of supporting sources . In the world of cryptocurrency , where market-moving events are often meticulously documented and reported by credible news outlets, the absence of any authoritative references makes it extremely unlikely that such a massive purchase would go unnoticed. The UAE government or any related official entities would likely have made a public announcement or issued a formal press release if such a monumental investment in Bitcoin were indeed taking place. The lack of verifiable information and transparency surrounding this claim makes it clear that the rumor has no solid foundation. The Impact of Misinformation in the Crypto Space The spread of misleading or false information within the crypto community can have significant consequences, especially when it comes to market sentiment and investor behavior . False claims about major players in the cryptocurrency space , such as sovereign states like the UAE , can lead to false price movements , increased volatility , and misinformed trading decisions . For example, had the $40 billion Bitcoin purchase claim been true, it could have caused a surge in Bitcoin’s price as investors speculated on the potential long-term implications of such a massive institutional investment. However, since this claim has now been debunked, it serves as a reminder of how easily rumors can influence market behavior , even in a space that is supposed to be driven by transparency and verified data . Bitcoin Archive’s Role in Providing Accurate Information As Bitcoin Archive continues to serve as a trusted source of news and analysis in the crypto space, the account’s commitment to debunking false rumors and misleading claims is vital in maintaining market integrity . By addressing false narratives , Bitcoin Archive helps ensure that investors and traders are equipped with the correct information to make well-informed decisions. In this case, Bitcoin Archive has taken a proactive stance in calling out the $40 billion claim for what it is— a rumor without credible backing . Their ability to quickly respond to misinformation helps mitigate the spread of false narratives and maintains the credibility of cryptocurrency news and market analysis . The Need for Caution in Crypto Market Claims The UAE’s alleged Bitcoin purchase serves as a prime example of how rumors can spread in the fast-moving world of cryptocurrencies . While Bitcoin continues to gain institutional interest , it is essential for investors, media outlets , and industry figures to critically assess the information they share. In the future, the crypto market should place greater emphasis on fact-checking and verifying claims, particularly when it comes to high-profile events that can influence market sentiment. The spread of misinformation can ultimately erode trust in the market and result in unnecessary volatility . Conclusion: A Reminder to Verify Crypto News In conclusion, the claim of the UAE purchasing $40 billion worth of Bitcoin has been debunked by Bitcoin Archive , which pointed out the lack of credible sources , links , and supporting evidence . The spread of this fake news highlights the importance of verifying crypto market information , especially when it comes to rumors that can impact investor sentiment and market dynamics. As the cryptocurrency space continues to mature, it is crucial for industry participants to rely on trusted sources and verifiable data to avoid the consequences of misleading narratives . Bitcoin Archive’s swift debunking of the rumor helps maintain the integrity of the crypto market and ensures that investors are not swayed by unsubstantiated claims.

38003106,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=375805,1734954229,Why is the XRP Price Down Today? (Ripple Price Analysis),"Ripple is navigating a pivotal range between $1.8 and $3, with recent price action highlighting the likelihood of a consolidation phase. A breakout from this range will likely determine its next significant trend. XRP Price Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart XRP recently faced rejection at the critical $3 resistance, triggering increased volatility and initiating a sideways consolidation phase. After that, the price found support at the $1.8 level, a key zone filled with demand and buying pressure. This support region can limit further downward movement and maintain the cryptocurrency within the $1.8-$3 range. As the price consolidates, a bullish or bearish breakout will determine Ripple’s upcoming trajectory. While this could lead to a sustained uptrend, an unexpected bearish breakdown might trigger a significant liquidation event, causing the price to plummet toward lower levels. Source: TradingView The 4-Hour Chart During the 4-hour timeframe, XRP consolidates within a descending wedge pattern, which often signals a potential bullish breakout if breached upward. Currently, the price is testing the wedge’s lower boundary near the $1.8 support level, where increased buying activity is expected. In the mid-term, Ripple seems likely to continue fluctuating within this pattern, with a bullish breakout aiming to reclaim higher levels near $3. Conversely, a bearish breakdown below the wedge’s lower boundary could initiate a decline, potentially driving the price toward the $1.5 threshold, a crucial support level.

38003132,https://finbold.com/?p=221967,1734954211,Arthur Hayes just dumped $10 million of this crypto he supports,"Arthur Hayes is a famous crypto investor, executive and influencer, co-founder of BitMEX and CIO of his family office Maelstrom Fund. Just recently, Hayes dumped over $10 million of the Ethena ( ENA ) cryptocurrency, a project he has funded and supports. According to data Finbold retrieved from Arkham Intelligence , the famous investor received 9 million ENA from an Ethena smart contract on December 22 and deposited this amount to two centralized exchange addresses. First, Hayes sent 7 million ENA, worth $8.47 million, to Binance after receiving $10.91 million from the contract. Then, the executive sent 2 million ENA, worth $2.42 million, to an address Lookonchain identified as belonging to Bybit. It is possible that this amount comes from unstaking 9 million sENA from Ethena’s liquid staking protocol. This is because Hayes’s address has an sENA activity from one week ago worth $8.88 million at that time. Arthur Hayes crypto transfers. Source: Arkham Intelligence / Finbold Arthur Hayes supports Ethena (ENA) Notably, Arthur Hayes is also a known Ethena supporter in many fronts. For example, he inspired USDe’s creation through a paper describing a stablecoin that would work similarly to what Ethena designed. However, Hayes’s drafts suggested using Bitcoin ( BTC ) automated trades instead of the Staked Ethereum ( sETH ) used by Ethena’s stablecoin USDe. The millionaire investor has supported the project since its launch, not only by inspiring it with his paper but also with funding and advisory. As CoinDesk reported , the Maelstrom Fund was one of Ethena’s investors in a $6 million funding round led by Dragonfly. As of this writing, Arthur Hayes holds $36.44 million in his known addresses, according to Arkham Intelligence . Out of that, sENA makes the third largest position, currently with 7.919 million sENA, worth $8.35 million. Hayes also has 18,580 ENA, worth $19,680. Arthur Hayes holdings.

38003151,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=113364,1734954174,"U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs See $463M in Net Inflows, BlackRock IBIT Leads the Pack","U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs See $463M in Net Inflows, BlackRock IBIT Leads the Pack According to recent data shared by Trader T (@thepfund) on X (formerly Twitter), U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced a combined net inflow of $463 million last week. The data highlights significant developments within the Bitcoin ETF market , with a notable influx of capital into Bitcoin-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as institutional and retail investors continue to seek exposure to the cryptocurrency market. Among these Bitcoin ETFs , BlackRock’s IBIT ETF led the way, recording a substantial net inflow of $1.452 billion . In contrast, when excluding IBIT , the remaining U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs saw net outflows totaling $989 million . This stark contrast between IBIT’s inflows and the outflows from other ETFs suggests a growing preference for BlackRock’s ETF in the current market environment. Key Highlights: U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Combined net inflows of $463 million for U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs last week. BlackRock’s IBIT ETF saw an impressive net inflow of $1.452 billion . Other U.S. Bitcoin ETFs experienced net outflows of $989 million . The trading volume for U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs for the same period reached $26 billion . Since the start of the fourth quarter , these ETFs have accumulated a cumulative net inflow of $17.5 billion . BlackRock’s IBIT ETF Dominates with Record Inflows The strong performance of BlackRock’s IBIT ETF stands out in the latest data, as it alone accounted for a net inflow of over $1.45 billion . This surge in capital into IBIT underscores the growing institutional appetite for Bitcoin exposure through regulated financial products . BlackRock’s entry into the Bitcoin ETF space has been met with enthusiasm from investors looking to gain exposure to Bitcoin without the complexities of directly holding the cryptocurrency. The IBIT ETF’s performance reflects the broader trend of institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies , especially as major financial institutions like BlackRock continue to develop Bitcoin-related products . This marks an important milestone for Bitcoin ETFs , signaling that institutional interest in digital assets is gaining momentum and could continue to drive Bitcoin’s price and market legitimacy . Other Bitcoin ETFs Struggle with Outflows Despite the success of IBIT , other U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have experienced challenges, with net outflows totaling $989 million . This disparity between IBIT’s performance and that of other Bitcoin ETFs may be due to several factors, including investor preference for larger, well-established funds like BlackRock’s IBIT , which benefits from its strong brand reputation and institutional backing . Moreover, the ongoing market volatility and the complex regulatory environment surrounding cryptocurrencies may have led to a more cautious stance from investors, particularly in the Bitcoin ETF sector . Smaller ETFs may be struggling to maintain investor confidence as a result, while larger funds like IBIT continue to see strong inflows. Cumulative Net Inflows of $17.5 Billion in Q4 Looking at the broader picture, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have experienced a cumulative net inflow of $17.5 billion since the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2024 . This reflects an overall positive trend for Bitcoin ETFs , despite the mixed results among individual funds. The overall growth in inflows indicates that investors are increasingly turning to Bitcoin ETFs as a way to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency market while mitigating some of the risks associated with direct cryptocurrency trading. Trading Volume and Investor Sentiment The total trading volume for U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs for the week was reported at $26 billion . This significant volume suggests that there is robust market activity and interest in Bitcoin-related financial products , particularly in the run-up to year-end . As Bitcoin remains a dominant force in the crypto market , Bitcoin ETFs are likely to continue to play a key role in providing access to digital assets for both retail and institutional investors . Conclusion: Growing Institutional Interest in Bitcoin ETFs The $463 million net inflow into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs last week, driven largely by the BlackRock IBIT ETF , is a strong indicator of the growing institutional interest in cryptocurrencies . The disparity between IBIT’s inflows and the outflows from other ETFs highlights the preference for larger, more established Bitcoin-backed financial products. With a cumulative net inflow of $17.5 billion for Bitcoin ETFs in the fourth quarter of 2024 , the momentum for institutional Bitcoin adoption is expected to continue into the new year. As more investors turn to Bitcoin ETFs for exposure to the crypto market , these funds will likely play a critical role in the continued growth and maturation of the Bitcoin market .

38003081,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=113361,1734954106,"Bitcoin Poised to Lead as Dominance Increases, Altcoins Lose Support: Glassnode Co-Founders","Bitcoin Poised to Lead as Dominance Increases, Altcoins Lose Support: Glassnode Co-Founders In a recent report shared on X (formerly Twitter), the co-founders of Glassnode , Jan Happel and Yann Allemann , discussed the current trends in the cryptocurrency market . Their analysis, posted under the Negentropic account, indicates that Bitcoin (BTC) is likely to lead the market as its dominance continues to increase, while altcoins are facing significant challenges, particularly as they lose crucial support levels . Bitcoin’s Dominance Strengthens According to the Glassnode co-founders, Bitcoin’s dominance in the market has been on the rise, especially after a brief dip below the $100,000 mark . The increased dominance of Bitcoin suggests that institutional and retail investors are gravitating more toward the top cryptocurrency as it gains more attention as a safe haven asset and a store of value . This is a significant shift as Bitcoin’s dominance typically rises when altcoins lose momentum or fail to maintain upward price movements, signaling a return of focus to Bitcoin . BTC’s dominance in the market is currently strengthening, likely due to Bitcoin’s stability compared to altcoins , many of which are struggling with support loss . Altcoins Losing Crucial Support While Bitcoin is gaining dominance, altcoins are experiencing a period of weakness, with many coins losing support levels that were previously considered crucial for maintaining price momentum. The Glassnode co-founders noted that altcoins are currently in accumulation zones , meaning they are likely being bought up at relatively low prices in anticipation of future growth, but the lack of support may prevent them from seeing significant upward price action in the short term. In their report, Happel and Allemann highlighted the increasing volatility among altcoins , where market sentiment seems to be shifting away from altcoins toward Bitcoin . This sentiment is likely exacerbated by the uncertainty surrounding altcoin adoption and regulatory issues that continue to plague the broader crypto market . The weakness in altcoins could be attributed to Bitcoin’s dominance and the growing preference for BTC among institutional investors . As Bitcoin stabilizes, it may continue to see increased investments while altcoins experience periods of stagnation. Bitcoin Stabilization Above $100,000 Could Spark Altcoin Surge Despite the current weakness of altcoins , the Glassnode co-founders suggested that altcoins could see a resurgence once Bitcoin stabilizes above the $100,000 mark. This stabilization would likely trigger a wave of interest and investment into altcoins , particularly those currently in accumulation zones . Bitcoin’s stabilization above $100,000 could indicate a period of market maturity , where Bitcoin’s price consolidates at a new higher level, potentially giving room for altcoins to recover. As Bitcoin stabilizes , investors may look to diversify into altcoins , fueling another potential phase of growth for these cryptocurrencies. Happel and Allemann also noted that as Bitcoin’s dominance increases , it creates a more favorable environment for altcoins to thrive. However, this only happens once Bitcoin reaches a point of stability at higher price levels. Until then, altcoins may continue to lag behind. A Strengthening Environment for Bitcoin The analysis by Glassnode suggests a strengthening environment for Bitcoin , with its increasing dominance and the growing number of investors flocking to it. In contrast, altcoins may continue to face challenges, especially if they cannot maintain support levels and show signs of sustained growth. As Bitcoin strengthens its position as a leading asset in the cryptocurrency market , it sets the tone for the broader market environment . Bitcoin’s dominance serves as an indicator that investors are becoming more cautious about altcoins and prefer to stay in Bitcoin until the market stabilizes further. Conclusion: Bitcoin Leads the Market as Altcoins Struggle for Support As Bitcoin dominance increases and altcoins struggle to maintain crucial support levels , the market appears poised for a continued focus on Bitcoin . The Glassnode co-founders’ insights suggest that Bitcoin is likely to remain the dominant force in the crypto space until it stabilizes above $100,000 , at which point altcoins may see a resurgence. For now, Bitcoin is leading the market, while altcoins find themselves in a challenging period , largely due to a lack of support and market volatility . However, as the market stabilizes, there is potential for altcoins to bounce back once Bitcoin reaches a new higher price level. Investors should stay alert for potential opportunities in both Bitcoin and altcoins as the market evolves.

38003045,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=113356,1734954009,"Substantial Increase in Crypto Holders in the Last Two Years, Reports Santiment","Substantial Increase in Crypto Holders in the Last Two Years, Santiment Reports According to a recent report from Santiment , a leading crypto market intelligence platform , there has been a substantial increase in the number of non-empty cryptocurrency wallets over the past two years . The report highlights significant growth in wallet holders for the top four cryptocurrencies by market capitalization : Bitcoin (BTC) , Ethereum (ETH) , Tether (USDT) , and XRP . The data shared by Santiment on X (formerly Twitter) reveals the following wallet growth: Bitcoin (BTC) wallets grew by 27% , reaching a total of 54.7 million . Ethereum (ETH) wallets increased by 47% , reaching 134.9 million . Tether (USDT) wallets saw a 66% rise , bringing the total to 6.57 million . XRP wallets grew by 28% , with a total of 5.75 million . Strong Growth in Major Cryptocurrencies The significant increase in the number of non-empty wallets for these top cryptocurrencies is a strong indicator of growing adoption and participation in the crypto market . The increase in holders suggests that more individuals and institutions are accumulating cryptocurrencies , contributing to their rising popularity and recognition as viable investment assets. Bitcoin (BTC): Continued Market Dominance Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap , has seen a 27% growth in the number of wallets holding Bitcoin in the past two years. The total number of non-empty Bitcoin wallets now stands at 54.7 million , reflecting Bitcoin’s continued dominance and appeal as a store of value and digital asset . As institutional adoption of Bitcoin continues to grow, more users are entering the ecosystem, adding to the total number of wallets and contributing to its growing market liquidity . Ethereum (ETH): Leading Smart Contract Platform Ethereum , the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap , has experienced a remarkable 47% rise in wallet holders over the last two years, with the number of non-empty Ethereum wallets reaching 134.9 million . Ethereum’s continued growth is driven by the increasing adoption of decentralized applications (dApps) and the rise of the DeFi (Decentralized Finance) ecosystem, where Ethereum serves as the foundational platform. The growth in Ethereum wallets reflects its expanding use case and its pivotal role in the smart contract space. Tether (USDT): Stablecoin Growth Tether (USDT) , the largest stablecoin by market capitalization, has seen the most significant growth among the top cryptocurrencies, with a 66% increase in wallets holding Tether over the past two years. The number of non-empty Tether wallets has surged to 6.57 million . This growth underscores Tether’s role as a widely-used digital dollar for trading and transferring value in the crypto market. The stablecoin is used as a bridge between cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies, making it an essential tool for crypto traders and investors seeking stability in volatile markets. XRP: Growing Interest in Cross-Border Payments XRP , the native token of the Ripple network, has also experienced a 28% increase in wallet holders, bringing the total number of XRP wallets to 5.75 million . XRP is often used for cross-border payments , and its growth suggests that more individuals and institutions are using the token for remittances and international transfers . Ripple’s push for greater regulatory clarity and its involvement in multiple financial partnerships have likely contributed to the growing adoption of XRP . Implications of Increased Crypto Holders The substantial rise in crypto holders across these major coins suggests a positive trend for the cryptocurrency market. More wallet holders mean greater participation in the market, leading to increased liquidity , price discovery , and a broader adoption of cryptocurrencies as mainstream assets . As more users and investors accumulate these digital assets, the market becomes more resilient and mature, creating a more robust ecosystem for the long-term future of cryptocurrencies. In addition, the growth in wallets indicates a wider acceptance of cryptocurrencies as stores of value , payment methods , and investment tools , especially as institutional investors and retail investors continue to embrace the crypto market. Conclusion: Crypto Adoption Continues to Surge The data from Santiment clearly shows that the number of crypto holders has experienced a significant surge over the last two years. The growth of wallets for Bitcoin , Ethereum , Tether , and XRP reflects an ongoing trend of adoption in the cryptocurrency market, driven by both retail and institutional investors . As the market continues to mature and cryptocurrencies become more integrated into the global financial system , this growth in holders is a positive sign of the future of digital assets . As more individuals and organizations enter the space, the crypto ecosystem will likely continue to evolve, offering new opportunities for investment, financial inclusion , and technological innovation .

38002972,https://coinpedia.org/?p=396534,1734953907,Meme Coins Like Bonk and DogWifHat Lead Solana dApp Revenues. Rollblock Aims To Surpass All,"The post Meme Coins Like Bonk and DogWifHat Lead Solana dApp Revenues. Rollblock Aims To Surpass All appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In November 2024, Solana’s decentralized applications (DApps) generated $365 million in revenue, with meme coin platforms leading the bull run. Bonk and DogWifHat are leading the charge, but it needs to be asked if a meme coin bull run is sustainable. Usually, they are not, and investors would be well advised to seek out tokens with better long-term and short-term potential. An impossible ask? Not necessarily. Rollblock is raising its hand to be the investment token of the year. Rollblock (RBLK): New Altcoin Brings Online Gambling To The Blockchain Online gambling is a massive industry sector, but investing in this lucrative industry was reserved only for moguls and millionaires. Now, Rollblock is bringing online gambling investments to retail investors thanks to its presale. Here’s the tea: Rollblock already exists. It’s not making promises of what it may do one day in the future; Rollblock’s online casino is live and active and offers punters hundreds of games to choose from. Rollblock boasts the title of the world’s first play-to-earn online casino built on Ethereum. Rollblock is now having a presale of its RBLK utility token to raise liquidity for its online casino. The potential for massive price growth here is obvious, but it gets even better. All Rollblock token holders get paid a weekly share of the income generated by the online casino, making Rollblock an income-bearing asset. It’s no wonder that thousands of investors have supplied Rollblock with over $7.4 million worth of liquidity; this token is changing the face of online gambling, and now retail investors can grab a slice of the pie. Bonk (BONK): King Of The Solana Meme Coins Meme coins are frivolous, but they can be exceptionally lucrative. Bonk is a case in point of this, as the token showed a phenomenal rise during 2024 and then dropped the ‘phenomenal’ adjective for something even more superlative during the November pump. Early adopters of Bonk are laughing to the Lambo dealership – but only if they got out on time. Meme coins like Bonk tend to crash and burn, as at the end of the day, there’s nothing of value to underpin their price. Bonk may still make money this bull run, but at what risk? DogWifHat (WiF): Second Placed Solana Meme Coin Loses Half Its value DogWifHat (WIF) is in many ways a textbook example of a meme coin. It is not just frivolous but outright silly. If not spurious. Its financial underpinnings? None. WIF is worthless, with zero infrastructure of use to give it value. Yet, this Solana meme coin has returned 46,000% yields since its launch. That is the good news. The bad news is that it was closer to 100,000% in March this year. WIF crashed and shed half its value since then. WIF is now at a level lower than it was before the Trump Pump. Yes, meme coins are fun, but are they worth it? Conclusion Investing in meme coins can be lucrative, but the fun and games can come to a rapid end when the bull run ends and investors stand to lose the farm. There are much safer investments out there. Rollblock exemplifies a token with immediate short-term yield and long-term passive income. Rollblock is now available at $0.043.

38002945,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=113354,1734953861,"Funds Expected to Exit Crypto Market During Christmas Week, Researcher Predicts","Funds Expected to Exit Crypto Market During Christmas Week, Researcher Forecasts According to Adam , a macro researcher at the crypto options trading platform Greeks.live , a fund withdrawal from the cryptocurrency market is expected during the Christmas week . This prediction follows past trends where the U.S. and European stock markets close for the holiday season. Adam’s insights, shared through a post on X (formerly Twitter), highlight that this trend of capital outflows is becoming more pronounced in comparison to previous years, indicating a potential dip in market liquidity. The Role of ETFs in Crypto Funding Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) continue to play a crucial role in providing external funding to the crypto market . However, according to Adam, ETFs are currently under pressure due to the market’s volatility and the capital outflows expected in the coming days. ETFs, which have been a significant source of investment in cryptocurrencies , especially for institutional investors, may face challenges during the holiday period when the broader market slows down. This could lead to diminished liquidity in the crypto space as funds are withdrawn or repositioned, contributing to the potential downturn or stagnation of crypto asset prices . $12 Billion in Crypto Options Set to Expire A major contributor to the fund withdrawals and market adjustments is the impending expiration of nearly $12 billion in crypto options this week. This represents over 40% of the total open interest in the market. With such a large portion of the market in crypto options set to expire, major investors are expected to adjust their positions to align with new market conditions. These adjustments could trigger further market movements as traders rebalance their portfolios in preparation for the expiration of these options. The expiration of crypto options often leads to increased volatility , but Adam predicts that the Christmas week will see relatively low volatility . This can be attributed to the general market slowdown that occurs during the holiday period, as many institutional investors take time off, and retail activity tends to drop. Low Market Volatility Expected This Christmas Week Adam’s forecast also suggests that market volatility will remain low throughout the Christmas week . As is often the case during major holidays, crypto trading volume is expected to decrease, leading to less drastic price movements and a quieter trading environment. Investors and traders may refrain from making significant market moves as they await the end of the holiday season and the start of January 2025 , when the market may see a return to more active trading. The relatively low volatility is not unusual for the period between Christmas and the New Year , a time when markets globally experience reduced activity. The quiet trading conditions could persist until January , when institutional and retail investors return to the market with renewed focus. Focus Shifts to the Inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump While the Christmas week may see subdued market activity, attention is expected to shift toward the upcoming inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on January 20, 2025 . This high-profile event is likely to attract significant media attention and could influence market sentiment, including the crypto market . If President-elect Trump’s administration moves forward with pro-crypto policies or announcements regarding digital asset regulation , it could reignite interest in cryptocurrencies as investors look for clarity on how new policies might shape the market. Conversely, a more cautious stance by the incoming administration could lead to further market uncertainty , particularly if there are delays in legislative decisions. Conclusion: A Quiet Christmas Week with Long-Term Implications The crypto market is expected to experience fund withdrawals and relatively low volatility during the Christmas week . As $12 billion in crypto options expire and ETFs face pressure, market liquidity is likely to decrease, leading to potential price stagnation or mild corrections. Despite this temporary slowdown, the broader trend for the crypto market in 2025 could be influenced by policy decisions and macro-economic factors as we approach the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump . While Christmas week may offer a quiet period for crypto traders, the events leading into the new year and January 20, 2025 will likely drive market sentiment and determine the next phase of cryptocurrency growth .

38002944,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=113351,1734953788,"Altcoin Season Index Drops to 43, Signaling Bitcoin Season","Altcoin Season Index Falls to 43, Indicating Bitcoin Season As of December 23, 2024 , the Altcoin Season Index registered a score of 43 , marking a one-point decline from the previous day. This shift signals that the cryptocurrency market is currently in Bitcoin Season , where Bitcoin (BTC) is outperforming most altcoins in terms of price performance. The Altcoin Season Index , tracked by CoinMarketCap (CMC) , serves as a valuable metric to gauge the overall sentiment in the cryptocurrency market , particularly in relation to altcoins versus Bitcoin . What is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index is a tool that compares the performance of the top 100 coins listed on CoinMarketCap (CMC) over a 90-day period , excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens . The index uses this data to determine whether the market is in Bitcoin Season or Altcoin Season based on how the top altcoins are performing relative to Bitcoin . For the market to be considered in Altcoin Season , at least 75% of the top 100 coins must outperform Bitcoin . Conversely, if Bitcoin outperforms 75% or more of the top 100 coins, the market is in Bitcoin Season . The index score ranges from 1 to 100 , with scores closer to 100 indicating a stronger Altcoin Season , while scores closer to 1 reflect a dominance of Bitcoin in the market. Current Market: Bitcoin Season With the Altcoin Season Index now at 43 , it indicates that Bitcoin has regained the upper hand in the market. This is consistent with the idea of Bitcoin Season , where Bitcoin’s dominance continues to outpace the performance of altcoins . At this score, Bitcoin is outperforming altcoins , and this can be attributed to various factors such as institutional interest , market uncertainty , or Bitcoin’s status as a store of value during volatile market conditions. The shift into Bitcoin Season often means that investors are turning their attention to Bitcoin as a more stable and safe haven asset, especially when there is market turbulence or unfavorable conditions for altcoins . Bitcoin’s dominance in the market can lead to increased capital inflows into Bitcoin while altcoins experience more volatility and price corrections. How the Altcoin Season Index Works The Altcoin Season Index is updated daily , reflecting the latest market conditions. The index’s primary purpose is to provide cryptocurrency investors with insight into the performance trends of Bitcoin and altcoins , offering a gauge of whether altcoins are gaining traction or if Bitcoin continues to dominate. The index is calculated based on the performance of the top 100 coins by market capitalization, making it a broad indicator of market sentiment . The key threshold for Bitcoin Season is when 25% or fewer of the top 100 coins outperform Bitcoin . In this current scenario, with the index score at 43 , it is clear that the altcoins are lagging behind, and Bitcoin continues to maintain its dominance . Factors Influencing Bitcoin Season Several factors could be contributing to the ongoing Bitcoin Season as reflected in the Altcoin Season Index . Some of the key reasons include: Institutional Adoption of Bitcoin – As more institutional investors integrate Bitcoin into their portfolios, the demand for Bitcoin continues to rise. This drives Bitcoin’s price performance higher, overshadowing altcoins . Market Sentiment and Economic Uncertainty – During times of economic uncertainty or market volatility , investors often flock to Bitcoin as a safe-haven asset. Bitcoin’s perceived stability compared to altcoins leads to greater capital flows into Bitcoin. Regulatory Developments – Regulations and legislative changes surrounding cryptocurrencies can affect altcoins more than Bitcoin , causing investors to shift their focus back to Bitcoin during uncertain regulatory periods. Bitcoin’s Historical Performance – Bitcoin has a long history of outperforming altcoins during periods of strong market growth or economic stress . Its first-mover advantage and established market dominance make it the preferred choice for many investors. What’s Next for the Altcoin Market? Despite the dominance of Bitcoin , the Altcoin Season Index can shift quickly, especially if there is a major surge in altcoin performance relative to Bitcoin . Altcoins can experience periods of explosive growth driven by new technological advancements, protocol upgrades , or market trends that favor specific altcoins. For instance, if the DeFi (Decentralized Finance) space continues to expand, or if there is a breakthrough innovation in blockchain technology that benefits altcoins, the Altcoin Season could return. Similarly, if Ethereum or other major altcoins experience significant price rallies or adoption increases, we could see a shift back toward Altcoin Season . Conclusion: A Period of Bitcoin Dominance Currently, the Altcoin Season Index at 43 indicates that the market remains firmly in Bitcoin Season , with Bitcoin outperforming the majority of altcoins . While Bitcoin’s dominance continues to rule the market, altcoins will likely need additional catalysts to make a strong comeback. Investors should remain mindful of the market sentiment and track the Altcoin Season Index for signs of a potential shift in the coming months. As the cryptocurrency market evolves, the relationship between Bitcoin and altcoins will continue to be shaped by technological developments , regulatory changes , and market dynamics . Whether the market will shift back to Altcoin Season or remain in Bitcoin Season will depend on the broader market trends and the performance of individual cryptocurrencies.

38002875,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=113347,1734953720,"Crypto Fear & Greed Index Falls to 70, Remains in ‘Greed’ Zone","Crypto Fear & Greed Index Falls to 70, Staying in the ‘Greed’ Zone As of December 23, 2024 , the Crypto Fear & Greed Index has dropped to 70 , marking a slight decline of three points from the previous day. Despite this small dip, the index remains in the “Greed” zone , indicating a market sentiment that is still characterized by optimism and positive sentiment , albeit slightly weaker than before. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , provided by the software development platform Alternative , is a widely recognized tool used to measure the emotional sentiment of the cryptocurrency market . It ranges from 0 to 100 , with 0 representing extreme fear and 100 signaling extreme greed . This index provides a quick snapshot of how investors are feeling about the crypto market , offering valuable insight into whether the market is overbought , oversold , or experiencing balanced sentiment . Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index The Fear & Greed Index is based on six different factors , each contributing a specific percentage to the overall score. These factors include: Volatility (25%) – This measures the market’s price fluctuations, both in the short and long term, and can indicate investor confidence or anxiety. Market Momentum/Volume (25%) – This factor assesses whether the market is showing upward or downward momentum, along with trading volumes. Social Media (15%) – Social sentiment, including discussions, mentions, and trends, plays a role in gauging the collective mood of crypto investors. Surveys (15%) – Polls and surveys conducted with crypto investors help determine how confident or fearful the market participants feel. Bitcoin Dominance (10%) – The percentage of total market capitalization held by Bitcoin compared to other cryptocurrencies. A higher dominance may indicate that investors are seeking safer, established assets like Bitcoin. Google Trends (10%) – This tracks the search volume for relevant cryptocurrency-related terms on Google, offering insight into public interest in digital assets. These factors are combined to calculate the overall index score, providing a snapshot of market sentiment on a daily basis. Market Sentiment: Weakened but Still in the ‘Greed’ Zone With the Crypto Fear & Greed Index at 70 , it suggests that the overall market sentiment is still in the “Greed” zone, but has softened slightly from higher readings in recent days. This level of greed indicates that there is still a significant level of optimism in the market, but investor confidence may be facing some headwinds. Although the market sentiment has weakened, the index is far from the “Extreme Greed” territory, which typically occurs when the score is above 80 . In such conditions, markets can become overheated, leading to a potential price correction. The 70 reading, while still high, suggests that there is caution among investors, and market participants may be cautious of becoming too overconfident. This shift in sentiment could be a result of several factors, such as recent price volatility , changes in market momentum , or external economic events that have slightly dampened investor optimism. However, the fact that the index remains in the Greed zone indicates that the bullish momentum still prevails in the crypto market . Implications of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index for Investors For crypto investors , the Fear & Greed Index is an important tool to gauge the market mood and make informed decisions. A score in the Greed zone typically suggests that investors are confident in the market, but it may also indicate the risk of market overextension or an impending correction . This is especially true when the index remains high for an extended period of time. On the other hand, when the index shows Extreme Fear , it can signal undervaluation in the market, potentially creating buying opportunities for long-term investors. For those looking to capitalize on market sentiment , the Fear & Greed Index can serve as a helpful indicator of when to enter or exit positions, although it should always be used in conjunction with other market analysis tools.

38003052,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=632187,1734953684,Elon Musk’s D.O.G.E is coming after the Federal Reserve as it scrambles to explain last week’s hawkish cut,"Elon Musk has set his sights on the Federal Reserve, calling it “absurdly overstaffed” in a post on X (formerly Twitter). The eccentric billionaire, soon to lead the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) under President Donald Trump, seems interested in picking apart the central bank. His comment came after the central bank announced a disappointing “hawkish rate cut,” leaving markets rattled and drawing sharp criticism from Trump. The Fed employs about 24,000 people across its 12 regional banks and the Board of Governors in Washington, a number Elon and Trump find excessive. Elon, alongside entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, is leading Trump’s $2 trillion government efficiency overhaul. “We’re trimming the fat,” Trump said during his campaign. “No one gets to sit around collecting a paycheck for doing nothing — not even Jerome Powell.” Trump and Elon vs. the Fed and Powell The President has been gunning for the central bank since day one. He blames its monetary policy for holding back economic growth during his first term and has taken many direct jabs at Powell, the Fed Chair he appointed. “It’s the easiest job in government,” Trump has mocked. “You show up once a month, say something vague, and then leave the rest to chance.” Elon’s new role as one of Trump’s closest advisors is amplifying these attacks. With D.O.G.E., he plans to overhaul bloated institutions. The central bank actually employs far fewer people than its European counterparts. Germany, France, and Italy’s central banks alone surpass the Fed’s staffing levels, but Trump thinks it’s still too big. Christine Lagarde, President of the European Central Bank, fired back at his comments. “I have thousands of hard-working people—economists, jurists, computer scientists—who defend the euro every day, not just once a month,” she said. Powell, for his part, has remained silent, true to form. The Fed’s hawkish cut San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly described Last week’s announcement of a 25-basis-point rate cut as a “close call.” Recently, she explained that the decision was the end of the recalibration phase, which forced them to take a more cautious approach. Markets did not take it well. The S&P 500 dropped nearly 3%, and the Nasdaq 100 tanked 3.6%, reflecting investor fears of prolonged inflation and slower monetary easing. The FOMC also revised its projections for 2025, raising the median estimate for the federal funds rate to 3.9% from 3.4%. This means fewer rate cuts are coming, with just two more anticipated instead of the previously expected six or even four. Daly said that policymakers must remain flexible, saying, “We’ll adjust if inflation drops faster or if the labor market weakens significantly.” The labor market’s strength and persistent inflation risks have forced the Fed into a tight spot. Earlier this year, it implemented rate cuts in September (50 basis points) and November (25 basis points) to counter signs of economic slowdown. But inflation has proven stubborn, leaving the Fed to balance growth and stability. The Fed’s budget and staffing The Fed’s 2024 budget climbed 6.3% to $6.053 billion, covering operations, staff salaries, and services to the U.S. Treasury. It plans to employ 21,238 full-time workers, a 1.9% increase from last year. Elon has called this growth “unacceptable,” pointing to technological advancements that should reduce the need for additional personnel. Trump’s broader economic policies could add to the Fed’s challenges. His proposed tariffs and tax cuts are expected to drive inflation up by 2.5 percentage points, potentially pushing core inflation above the 2% target by 2025. Analysts warn that the Fed may have to even delay next year’s two rate cuts until the fourth quarter due to this. Meanwhile, Powell has defended his office’s independence, saying its decisions are made for the benefit of all Americans, not political agendas. But Trump doesn’t care. “Why should unelected bureaucrats have the final say on our economy?” he asked. “We’re taking back control.” From Zero to Web3 Pro: Your 90-Day Career Launch Plan",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | DOGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/elon-musk-doge-fed-scramble-hawkish-cut/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/38003052.jpeg

However, the price has now reached a critical support level, suggesting the potential for a bullish consolidation phase in the mid-term. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart Cardano recently failed to breach the substantial $1.3 resistance zone due to heightened selling pressure, driven mainly by participants capitalizing on the distribution phase and opening short positions. This rejection led to a decline, with the price finding support at the crucial $0.8 level, where a bullish rebound has already occurred. The price range between $0.8 and $1.3 represents a critical consolidation zone, with buyers likely defending the $0.8 threshold. A bullish retracement phase toward the $1.3 mark is anticipated over the mid-term. Source: TradingView The 4-Hour Chart The rejection at $1.3 is reflected on the 4-hour chart, where significant selling activity pushed the price downward. This correction aligns with the typical behavior of a healthy bullish trend, allowing for profit-taking and market stabilization. Cardano’s price has landed within a robust support region, defined by the 0.5 ($0.8) – 0.618 ($0.7) Fibonacci levels. This area is expected to be a strong defense, preventing further declines.

38002842,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=113344,1734953641,VanEck Proposes Bitcoin Reserve Could Cut U.S. National Debt by 36% by 2049,"VanEck Suggests Bitcoin Reserve Could Cut U.S. National Debt by 36% by 2049 In a bold new report, investment management firm VanEck has proposed the idea that the U.S. could potentially reduce its national debt by 36% by the year 2049 through the creation of a strategic Bitcoin reserve . According to the firm’s projections, the U.S. could significantly lower its national liabilities by accumulating Bitcoin as part of its national reserves . This proposal is based on the assumption that Bitcoin would appreciate at an annual rate of 25% , while the U.S. national debt continues to grow at a rate of 5% per year . Under these assumptions, VanEck suggests that the U.S. could reduce its national debt by approximately $42 trillion by 2049 , an amount that could alleviate much of the current financial burden facing the U.S. government. VanEck’s Vision for a Bitcoin-Fueled Economic Strategy VanEck’s suggestion that a Bitcoin reserve could play a key role in reducing national debt reflects the growing interest in cryptocurrencies as a potential asset class for financial stability . As the U.S. faces mounting challenges related to its national debt , the concept of using Bitcoin as a reserve asset presents an innovative and unconventional approach to managing the country’s finances. The idea behind this proposal is that, much like gold reserves , Bitcoin could serve as a store of value, one that could appreciate over time as demand for digital assets continues to grow. If the U.S. were to accumulate Bitcoin strategically over the coming decades, the growth in Bitcoin’s value could offset the increases in national debt , effectively creating a net reduction in overall liabilities. Projections Based on Bitcoin’s Expected Growth VanEck’s projections assume an annual Bitcoin appreciation rate of 25% , a figure based on the historical performance of Bitcoin over recent years. While past performance does not guarantee future results, the firm’s model takes into account Bitcoin’s historical growth and the increasing institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies . If Bitcoin continues to grow at a 25% annual rate, the value of U.S. reserves in Bitcoin could grow exponentially, allowing the country to use its Bitcoin holdings as a leveraging tool to reduce its overall debt. This strategy would hinge on the long-term growth of Bitcoin and the U.S. government’s ability to manage its reserves effectively. National Debt Growth and the Need for Innovative Solutions The U.S. national debt has been on an upward trajectory for years, with estimates putting it at over $31 trillion in 2024. According to VanEck , if the national debt continues to grow at 5% annually , it could reach $60 trillion by 2049. Without significant intervention, this growing debt burden could have long-term consequences for the U.S. economy, including higher interest payments, reduced fiscal flexibility, and potential negative impacts on economic growth. Given this financial challenge, traditional methods of managing debt, such as raising taxes or cutting government spending, may not be sufficient on their own. This is where VanEck’s proposal comes in—suggesting that a strategic accumulation of Bitcoin could provide a creative solution to reducing the national debt in a way that traditional fiscal measures cannot. The Role of Bitcoin as a Hedge Against Inflation Another key factor driving VanEck’s proposal is the increasing recognition of Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation . As central banks around the world continue to print money to meet fiscal needs, many economists and investors view Bitcoin as a safe haven against the erosion of purchasing power. Bitcoin’s fixed supply —there will only ever be 21 million Bitcoin —makes it an attractive asset for those seeking protection from inflation and currency devaluation . By holding Bitcoin in national reserves , the U.S. could potentially benefit from Bitcoin’s appreciation while also insulating itself from the inflationary pressures that come with traditional fiat currency systems. This would provide a dual benefit : reducing national debt and acting as a safeguard against the economic challenges posed by inflation and currency fluctuations . A Vision for the Future: Can Bitcoin Save the U.S. Economy? While VanEck’s proposal is still speculative, it highlights the potential for Bitcoin to play a transformative role in global financial systems . As cryptocurrencies gain mainstream adoption and institutional investors continue to integrate digital assets into their portfolios, the idea of Bitcoin as a reserve asset could become more feasible for governments around the world. For the U.S., accumulating Bitcoin could represent a way to leverage the digital asset ’s growth to address long-term fiscal challenges . By integrating Bitcoin into its reserve strategy , the U.S. could potentially reduce its debt load and stabilize its financial future. However, this would require a willingness from policy makers to embrace the volatile nature of digital assets and the uncertainties that come with cryptocurrency markets . Conclusion: Bitcoin and the Future of U.S. Debt Management VanEck’s proposal to use Bitcoin reserves as a strategy to reduce the U.S. national debt by 36% by 2049 is an intriguing and innovative concept that reflects the growing recognition of cryptocurrency as a valuable asset in global finance . With Bitcoin ’s potential for continued growth, it could play a pivotal role in addressing the financial challenges that lie ahead for the U.S. economy . While the proposal remains speculative, it highlights the broader trend of institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies and the evolving role of digital assets in reshaping economic policy . As the global economy faces increasing uncertainty, Bitcoin could emerge as a crucial tool for managing debt and building a more stable financial future.

38002774,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=113329,1734953503,"Quantum Computing Could Strengthen Bitcoin, Says Blockstream CEO","Quantum Computing Could Strengthen Bitcoin, Says Blockstream CEO Adam Back , CEO of Blockstream , a leading blockchain technology developer, believes that quantum computing has the potential to make the Bitcoin network even more powerful. Back addressed concerns about quantum computing’s ability to disrupt cryptographic systems, emphasizing that these risks are likely decades away. The Role of Quantum Computing in Bitcoin’s Future 1. Cryptographic Advancements Quantum computing’s immense processing power has sparked concerns about its potential to break existing cryptographic algorithms. However, Back remains optimistic, stating that by the time such capabilities emerge, Bitcoin will have integrated robust post-quantum (PQ) signature solutions. 2. Enhanced Network Security Post-quantum signature research is expected to yield conservative, well-reviewed, and compact cryptographic signatures . These could be seamlessly integrated into Bitcoin’s protocol as an additional layer of security. “The Bitcoin network is well-positioned to adopt cryptographic advancements, ensuring resilience against future quantum threats,” Back noted on X (formerly Twitter). Quantum Computing: A Threat or an Opportunity? 1. Potential Threats Breaking SHA-256 Encryption: Bitcoin relies on the SHA-256 hashing algorithm to secure transactions and maintain its blockchain. Some fear that quantum computers could solve SHA-256 faster than traditional computers, compromising the network. Key Recovery: Quantum algorithms like Shor’s algorithm could potentially reverse-engineer Bitcoin private keys, endangering wallet security. 2. Opportunities for Bitcoin Quantum computing could accelerate transaction verification , improving scalability and efficiency. Enhanced cryptographic techniques could fortify the Bitcoin network, making it more secure than ever. Timeline for Quantum Risk Adam Back emphasized that quantum computing is not an immediate threat: Current quantum technology is far from the computational scale required to threaten Bitcoin’s cryptography.

An analyst is also bullish on Stellar (XLM), predicting gains if bulls hold a crucial support level. Notably, the price of BNB reached lows of $620 on Dec. 20, while that of XLM traded at $0.31. But can bulls reclaim support zones and push BNB, and XLM higher? BNB price sees a minor bounce Although the BNB market cap is down since its ATH earlier this month, it has recovered to recent highs of $675 and could target $700. BNB’s uptick comes amid an overall weakness in the altcoin market and BTC’s struggles to chart a fresh upside. The flagship cryptocurrency touched lows of $92k last week. In this case, sentiment is slightly bearish for altcoins. However, as Binance put it in a recent blog post, the crypto market often experiences dramatic swings. “Beyond the headlines and “number go up” narratives”, a long term view is often the key to opportunity, Binancr wrote in the blog post. Two strategies investors use include dollar-cost averaging and HODLing. BNB’s minor bounce includes a 0.5% return in the past 24 hours. BNB Chart : TradingView After diving to lows of $620, BNB has retested $675 and then slipped off the resistance line. The altcoin’s daily chart shows the relative strength index and moving average convergence divergence indicators favouring the sellers. If BNB falls below $600, it could rely on primary support near the $550. Nonetheless, the daily RSI is pointing to a potential upward extension and the primary target could be $800 and then the psychological $1,000. Stellar (XLM) price shows buy signal Stellar price is down 3.3% in the past 24 hours and 17% in the past 30 days. This outlook has the XLM token trading within the lower range of $0.3481 – $0.3706, off weekly highs of $0.46. XLM’s latest struggle coincides with the declines for all top altcoins by market cap. In November, Stellar rallied as XRP exploded following the US election and Donald Trump’s win. Stellar price has also surged in recent weeks as Ripple announced the imminent launch of its stablecoin RLUSD. But with Bitcoin slipping amid broader market sell-off pressure, XRP fell to around $2 and XLM tanked to the aforementioned level. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez says Stellar has a potential buy signal on the daily chart. “If The TD Sequential presents a buy signal on the Stellar $XLM daily chart, anticipating a price rebound if the $0.33 support level holds,” the analyst posted on X.

The notice, requested by Finnish authorities, cites allegations of tax fraud and assault. HEX declined 25% in value following the Interpol announcement. But has since made a quick recovery. The Red Notice seeks Schueler’s provisional arrest but does not serve as an international arrest warrant. It follows a September 13 remand order from Finnish authorities, raising questions about discrepancies between Schueler’s reported income and the Finnish tax service’s estimates. Helsinki police detective Harri Saaristola highlighted these concerns, which further amplify suspicions of financial misconduct. Founder Placed on Europe’s Most Wanted List In addition to the Red Notice, Schueler has been placed on Europe’s Most Wanted list. He faces allegations of assaulting a 16-year-old by grabbing their hair, dragging them into a stairwell, and knocking them to the ground. The tax evasion charges span a four-year period from June 2020 to April 2024. Despite these serious accusations, Schueler has remained active on social media, posting cryptic remarks that appear to address the situation. On December 21, he commented on X (formerly Twitter), “If the haters really wanted to get me down, they could raise more than the $27M I did for medical research. Nothing makes haters angrier than success.” The market reaction has left observers puzzled, as HEX’s price jumped 15% amid the controversy. Analysts speculate that the surge may be driven by speculative trading or Schueler’s staunch supporters viewing the situation as an opportunity to defend the cryptocurrency. The developments add a dramatic twist to HEX’s volatile history, leaving the crypto community divided on whether the legal challenges will impact the token’s long-term viability.

38002696,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=375799,1734953361,Bitcoin Price Analysis: Can BTC Bounce Back to $100K Following 8% Weekly Drop?,"Bitcoin has been navigating an ascending consolidation phase near its critical $108K resistance level, recently encountering a sharp decline. However, strong support zones suggest a potential for a short-term bullish rebound. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart Bitcoin has undergone an ascending consolidation phase near the $108K resistance region, only to face increased selling pressure and distribution activity from large market participants. This wave of selling led to a significant 15% decline, with the price finding support around the $90K mark and the middle boundary of a long-standing bullish price channel. These levels represent a critical defense line against further declines. A rebound from this support could set the stage for a renewed attempt to reclaim the $108K mark. Conversely, a failure to hold it may lead to a deeper correction, with the channel’s lower boundary near $75K serving as the next key level of support. Source: TradingView The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour chart, Bitcoin has been consistently trending upward within a multi-month bullish channel. The recent rejection at $108K triggered a sharp decline, bringing the price down to the channel’s middle boundary near $95K, a crucial dynamic support level. A bounce from this region is anticipated, allowing the price to stabilize and potentially resume its uptrend. However, concerns over a hawkish monetary policy for 2025 may amplify selling pressure, increasing the likelihood of a bearish breakout. In such a scenario, Bitcoin could face further downside, with $90K as an immediate target and $75K as long-term support. Source: TradingView On-chain Analysis By Shayan The Bitcoin Long-Term Holder SOPR metric provides valuable insights into market behavior and investor sentiment. Between 2022 and mid-2023, the SOPR remained below 1 for an extended period, indicating that long-term holders were selling at a loss associated with market capitulation. By mid-2023, the SOPR began trending closer to or above 1, marking the beginning of a recovery. This shift was aligned with a broader market rebound as Bitcoin prices rose, reflecting renewed confidence among investors. The upward trend in SOPR suggested that long-term holders were no longer selling at a loss, a key sign of improving sentiment. As the market moved into 2024, Bitcoin prices continued to climb, and the SOPR consistently stayed above 1. This shift signified that long-term holders realized profits, but the selling pressure remained controlled. The stability of the SOPR above 1 highlights sustained confidence among investors, reinforcing that market conditions support continued growth, with a potential for further market expansion.

With its controversial past including a bankruptcy filing in December 2023 following a token burn exploit that wiped out the Liquidity Pool and the arrest and prosecution of executives , SafeMoon faces a string of uncertainties surrounding its future, with many questioning whether the current price surge can be sustained. Why is SafeMoon’s price rising? One of the main catalysts behind SafeMoon’s recent surge is the release of the SafeMoon Wallet, which debuted in Beta in November and has now entered its open Beta stage after a successful closed Beta. The SafeMoon Wallet, which comes after the VGX Foundation acquired SafeMoon, has been pivotal in attracting fresh interest and driving up the SFM value. As VGX Foundation works on rebuilding and expanding the SafeMoon ecosystem, with plans for a Centralized Exchange and NFT marketplace, the SafeMoon Wallet is a significant part of its strategy to bring more functionality and accessibility to the SFM token. By giving users a more tangible, user-friendly way to manage their tokens, the wallet could help increase adoption. Additionally, the SafeMoon protocol’s deflationary features—like its coin-burning strategy—could provide long-term value for holders by reducing supply, thus theoretically increasing scarcity and potential value. The wallet’s integration into this broader ecosystem seems to be a driving force behind the recent surge, which accounts for a significant portion of the 132% jump in price over the last 30 days. Speculation and concerns: Can SafeMoon sustain the surge? While the launch of new products like the SafeMoon Wallet has fueled speculation that the token could continue rising, there are reasons to be cautious. The 2021 arrest of SafeMoon’s founders led to significant doubt in the market, and many investors, disillusioned by the events, moved on or failed to even migrate their assets to SafeMoon V2. However, since mid-November 2024, the token has started to regain attention, particularly with the development of the SafeMoon Wallet. Source: TradingView Despite a slight pullback after a surge to a high of $0.00009936, the token currently holds above the 50-Day MA and the 100-Day MA signaling that bulls are still in control. Yet, some investors are skeptical about the sustainability of this rally. There’s a strong divide over what is driving the surge. Some believe that the ongoing token burn and SafeMoon Wallet development are genuinely affecting the price, while others speculate that the rally could be driven by manipulation from the development team or even large whale investors pumping the price. This creates uncertainty about the long-term viability of SafeMoon’s growth. Moreover, the controversy surrounding the project’s leadership, coupled with lingering questions about its business model and regulatory challenges, leaves a shadow over its future performance. As with any investment, anyone considering an investment in SafeMoon (SFM) should proceed with caution and conduct thorough research before making any decisions.

38002637,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=113340,1734953221,Trump Nominates Pro-Crypto Stephen Miran as Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers,"Trump Nominates Pro-Crypto Stephen Miran as Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers In a recent announcement made via Truth Social , U.S. President-elect Donald Trump revealed that he has nominated Stephen Miran , a Harvard-trained economist and former senior advisor for economic policy at the U.S. Treasury Department during Trump’s first term, to be the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) . This nomination is significant not only for Miran’s credentials but also for his stance on cryptocurrency , an area that has gained increasing attention in the economic and financial sectors. A Pro-Crypto Stance from Miran Stephen Miran is known for his pro-crypto views, and his nomination comes at a time when cryptocurrency is becoming more integrated into the global financial ecosystem. In a recent appearance on The Bitcoin Layer podcast , Miran expressed his belief that cryptocurrency could play a key role in driving economic innovation and ushering in what he described as another Trump Administration economic boom . Miran’s comments on cryptocurrencies underscore his recognition of the potential role digital assets could play in shaping the future of the U.S. economy. He stated that crypto has a “big role potentially to play in innovation,” aligning with his broader economic outlook that seeks to capitalize on emerging technologies and disrupt traditional financial systems. Background of Stephen Miran Stephen Miran is a seasoned economist with significant experience in U.S. economic policy. He served as a senior advisor for economic policy at the U.S. Treasury Department during President Trump’s first term , where he worked on various economic reforms and contributed to policy discussions on key issues such as taxation and trade. Miran is also a Harvard-trained economist , and his academic background and expertise in economic policy make him a strong contender for the role of Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers . His deep understanding of macroeconomics and financial policy will be crucial as he works alongside the president to shape the country’s economic agenda in the coming years. The Council of Economic Advisers and Its Role The Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) is a key advisory body within the U.S. government that provides economic advice to the president. It plays a critical role in formulating national economic policy and analyzing the economic implications of proposed policies. The CEA has a history of being a platform for shaping the nation’s economic direction, and under Miran’s leadership, there is potential for a stronger focus on emerging sectors such as cryptocurrency , blockchain , and financial innovation . Miran’s nomination signals that the Trump administration is likely to pursue a more pro-innovation approach to economic policy, with a particular emphasis on technology-driven economic growth . This could include efforts to foster cryptocurrency adoption , blockchain innovation , and other areas where the U.S. can maintain a competitive edge in the global digital economy . Miran’s Crypto Vision for the U.S. Economy Miran’s pro-crypto stance is not just a personal view but reflects broader economic trends that are gaining traction worldwide. Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin , are increasingly seen as legitimate assets and alternative financial systems that can complement traditional currencies and offer greater financial inclusion . As cryptocurrencies continue to evolve and mature, they have the potential to disrupt existing financial infrastructures and create new opportunities for economic growth. In his comments on The Bitcoin Layer podcast , Miran highlighted the role crypto could play in stimulating economic activity and innovation, a vision that aligns with the broader goals of the Trump administration to foster a thriving economy through technological advancement. By nominating a pro-crypto economist like Stephen Miran , the incoming administration is signaling that it sees the potential for cryptocurrency to contribute positively to the country’s economic development .

This could involve incentivizing private sector investment in blockchain solutions and promoting the use of digital currencies for cross-border payments , remittances , and other financial services.

With Miran’s pro-crypto views , there is a clear indication that the administration may push for greater cryptocurrency adoption and integration into the broader U.S. economy .

38002636,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=113338,1734953153,"ETFs, Governments, and MicroStrategy Now Hold 31% of All Bitcoin Supply, CryptoQuant CEO Reveals","ETFs, Governments, and MicroStrategy Control 31% of Bitcoin Supply, Says CryptoQuant CEO In a recent update, Ki Young Ju , the Chief Executive Officer of blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant , revealed that ETFs , governments , and MicroStrategy now hold a significant portion of the total Bitcoin (BTC) supply. According to Ju , these entities currently control a staggering 31% of all Bitcoin in circulation. This marks a remarkable increase compared to their collective holdings in 2023, which were only around 14% . Ju shared this data through a post on X (formerly Twitter) , underscoring the growing influence of institutional investors and governments in the Bitcoin market . This surge in holdings reflects a shift towards more institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies , particularly Bitcoin , which continues to gain traction as a store of value and an asset for diversification in traditional investment portfolios. A Growing Trend: Institutional Ownership of Bitcoin The sharp increase in Bitcoin ownership by entities such as Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) , governments , and MicroStrategy signals a growing trend towards the institutionalization of Bitcoin. These organizations have long seen the value of Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty, especially amid the growing adoption of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency in the global financial ecosystem. The fact that ETFs and governments now control a combined 31% of Bitcoin’s total supply is a clear indicator of the increasing trust in Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. Over the past few years, numerous financial institutions have launched or shown interest in launching Bitcoin-backed ETFs to allow investors to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency market without directly holding the asset themselves. MicroStrategy’s Continued Dominance in Bitcoin Holdings MicroStrategy , the U.S.-based business intelligence firm, has been a long-time advocate for Bitcoin and is the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin . The company’s CEO, Michael Saylor , has led the firm to accumulate tens of thousands of Bitcoins over the past few years. As of now, MicroStrategy holds over 124,000 Bitcoins , making it a significant player in the Bitcoin market . This growing institutional ownership is not just about investment —it also signals greater stability for the cryptocurrency as a whole. MicroStrategy’s massive accumulation of Bitcoin showcases its belief in Bitcoin’s potential as a store of value and a financial asset for long-term appreciation . The Role of Governments in Bitcoin Ownership Another notable point in Ju’s revelation is the role of governments in accumulating Bitcoin. While specific government holdings are not always public, several countries have either mined Bitcoin or seized assets in various crypto-related law enforcement actions, contributing to their ownership of the cryptocurrency. For example, El Salvador , under President Nayib Bukele , has purchased large amounts of Bitcoin as part of its national cryptocurrency adoption initiative. Government ownership of Bitcoin further emphasizes its growing role in global monetary systems and its potential for nation-states to hold reserves in a decentralized, digital currency. This trend could continue to develop as more governments and central banks explore the potential benefits of holding Bitcoin alongside traditional currencies like the U.S. dollar . A Significant Shift in the Bitcoin Market The 31% ownership of Bitcoin by ETFs , governments , and MicroStrategy represents a significant shift in the Bitcoin market . Traditionally, Bitcoin was seen primarily as a retail investment and was mainly owned by individuals and smaller players . However, as institutional adoption increases, Bitcoin’s market dynamics are shifting, leading to greater market stability and legitimacy for the cryptocurrency. This growth in institutional holdings also suggests that Bitcoin’s role in the global financial ecosystem will continue to expand, especially as cryptocurrency adoption accelerates in the coming years. With ETFs and major corporations increasing their Bitcoin exposure, Bitcoin is becoming more ingrained in mainstream financial markets. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin’s Future? The rise in institutional holdings of Bitcoin suggests a positive outlook for the cryptocurrency’s future. As more traditional financial institutions , governments , and corporations continue to adopt Bitcoin as a store of value , its price stability and legitimacy as an asset class will likely increase. This could potentially lead to further price appreciation and greater global adoption , especially if other large players in the financial sector begin to follow suit. Additionally, the growing dominance of institutional investors and governments in the Bitcoin market could lead to greater regulation and standardization of the cryptocurrency market, helping to mitigate risks for retail investors while fostering confidence in Bitcoin as a mainstream asset. Conclusion: Institutional Ownership Marks Bitcoin’s Evolution The fact that ETFs , governments , and MicroStrategy now hold 31% of all Bitcoin is a testament to the growing institutional adoption of the cryptocurrency. With these players driving Bitcoin’s price stability and mainstream acceptance , Bitcoin is becoming a more prominent asset in global financial markets . As Bitcoin continues to gain legitimacy and institutional backing , the future of cryptocurrency looks increasingly secure. With institutional adoption on the rise, Bitcoin’s evolution from retail-driven speculation to a mainstream asset class is becoming a reality.

38002639,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/cardanos-charles-hoskinson-wants-to-play-kingmaker-in-us-crypto-regulation,1734953136,Cardano’s Charles Hoskinson Wants To Play Kingmaker In U.S. Crypto Regulation,"Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson says he wants to help the United States establish a crypto-friendly regulatory regime once President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House. He believes he can play a central role in the process, helping to facilitate conversations between prominent figures in the crypto industry and Trump’s “Crypto Czar”. Hoskinson’s comments came during an interview with COTI founder and CEO Shahaf Bar-Geffen, where he explained that the U.S. has fallen far behind other, more forward-thinking nations in Europe, the MiddleEast and Asia. He points out that countries like Israel and Japan has already established progressive regulations to foster the growth of crypto, whereas the U.S. has taken a much more hostile stance towards the industry. That will change under Trump, Hoskinson said. “The current President created this situation, but the upcoming President, Trump, wants to fix it,” he said. “So he’s going to appoint a Crypto Tzar, he’s going to work with the Senate and Congress now that there’s a unified government, and he’s going to appoint a pro-crypto SEC chair and CFTC chair.” Crypto Industry Must Step Up Now It’s not yet clear who Trump will turn to as his Crypto Czar. For days, it was said that ex-PayPal Chief Operating Officer David Sacks was the front-runner to land the job, but it’s said that he has since been sidelined due to his refusal to fully divest from his investment firm, Craft Ventures. Nonetheless, Hoskinson said Trump’s promise to hire somebody to take control of the crypto industry is a major step towards the U.S. introducing a more accommodating regulatory environment. What the crypto industry needs to do is take the initiative, and start looking at new ways in which emerging technologies like decentralized finance, decentralized autonomous organizations and smart contracts can be better regulated. “The industry has an obligation to use the next 6-9 months wisely, to have a discussion about what executive orders, administrative changes and law-making needs to be done to create a framework that’s workable for everybody,” Hoskinson stated. U.S. Risks Being Sidelined Without Regulation Hoskinson, who first came to prominence in the crypto industry when he helped to create the Ethereum network almost 10 years ago, is adamant that the U.S. needs to take action soon, or risk falling behind in what will eventually grow to become “a $10 trillion to $20 trillion industry.” He said the existing uncertainty has forced too many crypto projects to ignore the U.S. market and focus their efforts elsewhere, in countries with friendlier crypto regulatory regimes. COTI is one of those projects, Hoskinson said. He noted that it has made real strides in other countries like Israel, where it’s working with that country’s central bank on its “Digital Shekel” initiative. “COTI is worth about a quarter of a billion dollars today, and that entire ecosystem can’t touch the U.S.,” he said. “That’s one of thousands of stories globally, and think of all the value that would bring to the U.S. And think of the value the U.S. can bring to these projects.” Hoskinson accused the outgoing Biden administration of arbitrarily cutting off the entire crypto industry. And that forced the industry to do the same. “People basically said draw a ringfence around the U.S. and pretend it's radioactive and don’t touch it,” he said. “They said, never have a U.S. customer. It’s pretty devastating.” Fortunately, Hoskinson believes it’s not too late for the U.S. to reverse its stance, and in his opinion it can still become the best country in the world in which to establish and operate a crypto business. What’s required to get there is a fundamental shift in the way the U.S. government approaches financial innovation, he said, and he’s confident that will happen under Trump. “I think the team Trump is putting together is quite competent, quite capable,” he said. “I believe there’s a strong possibility that not only the U.S. people, but also international entrepreneurs, will be able to interact with that team and create a global framework that the IMF can understand, the FATIF can understand, that foreign regulation can interoperate with.” The “Connector-In-Chief” This is where Hoskinson thinks he can play a useful role, helping to formulate that framework. He told Bar-Geffen that he sees himself as a “connector-in-chief”, using his contacts with the industry and the U.S. government, facilitating conversations between policymakers and international crypto experts. As part of his plans, Hoskinson said he is working with various other people to send out a survey to major U.S. crypto companies, so he can provide that feedback to the Crypto Tzar and other key leaders in the Senate and Congress. The idea is that the industry will be able to say, off the record, “What’s the good, what’s the bad and ugly, and what do we need to fix.” “I’m going to bring in people from abroad, who would normally be excluded from the U.S. political process, and have them talk to U.S. lawmakers and talk to the administration to share problems they have already solved in many cases,” Hoskinson explained. “People from the ADGM in Abu Dhabi, for example, or people from FINMA in Switzerland and the Monetary Authority of Singapore.” Hoskinson admitted that this would be quite a revolutionary step for the U.S., as the country tends to do the opposite, regulating things at home before pushing its ideas outbound. “The world is ahead of us, so it’s time we learn from them and don’t replicate any of their mistakes,” he added. “Trump has made the mandate very clear. He wants the U.S. to be the best country in the world to found and run a cryptocurrency business or a blockchain business.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

38002567,https://zycrypto.com/?p=99276,1734952845,Ethereum Whales Are Dumping Assets; What’s Going On?,"Ethereum (ETH) faced increasing sell pressure last week as crypto prices tumbled. The largest altcoin, on the verge of an uphill climb ahead of 2025, has plummeted beyond multiple resistance levels. ETH trades at $3,336 at press time, a 2% drop in 24 hours and a sharp 19% decline this week. Massive ETH Outflows Data from crypto analytics firm Lookonchain shows whales offloading assets to recoup slight gains. This has ushered in declining sentiments after the Federal Reserve’s Jerome Powell stressed caution for future cuts. Although the central bank slashed policy rates by 25 basis points and hinted at two cuts in 2025, investors moved slowly after the decision. Caution on the Fed’s part could mean delayed cuts, which will cause funds to flow out of risky assets. Ethereum and altcoins have traded in this downward direction. An ETH whale sold huge assets on decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols to repay loans. The trader deposited 22,746 ETH worth approximately $77.7 million on Binance. On-chain data shows the amount used to pay Spark and Aave’s debts. In the last 48 hours, the wallet moved 31,968 ETH, about $122 million, to Binance. The exchange continues to record crypto exits as the wider market tumbles. The movement to centralized exchanges from other custodians indicates a scale sparking bearish sentiments. Hours after the transaction, another whale moved 49,910 ETH worth $170 million to Binance and withdrew $137 million of stablecoins from the exchange. Offloads by the Ethereum Foundation have also sparked low sentiments this year. The community criticized these withdrawals, calling for accountability before the team explained. “ Since the #EthereumFoundation sold 100 $ETH on Dec 17, the price of $ETH has dropped by ~17%, marking another successful top sale. Over the past year, #EthereumFoundation has sold 4,466 $ETH($12.6M) across 32 trades, with 15 of them executed at the top(marked in red in the table),” Lookonchain wrote. What’s Next For ETH Price Ethereum price has faced significant pressure alongside the wider market. Total liquidations have topped $2 billion, with the market cap declining 8% in 24 hours. As volumes plunge, several experts cast doubt on the anticipated ETH rally. However, ETH bulls continue to pick up assets, pushing for a recovery and a price above $5K in the altcoin rally . This is fueled by recent outflows from Bitcoin after its price slumped retracted below $100K. Analysts opine that the first step in an upward movement for ETH revolves around reclaiming the $3,500 resistance.",NEGATIVE,ETH,ALTCOIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/ethereum-whales-are-dumping-assets-whats-going-on/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png
38002407,https://coinpedia.org/?p=396400,1734952824,FTX Founder Sam Bankman Fried To Receive a Presidential Pardon? Truth OR Rumor?,"The post FTX Founder Sam Bankman Fried To Receive a Presidential Pardon? Truth OR Rumor? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), the former CEO of the defunct crypto exchange FTX, has become the subject of growing rumors surrounding the possibility of him receiving a presidential pardon. With SBF facing a lengthy sentence for his crimes, the speculation grew after Billionaire founder Elon Musk, said he would be “shocked if this doesn’t happen.” SBF To Get Presidential Pardon Failed crypto exchange FTX , whose empire collapsed in November 2022, was convicted on all seven charges after a five-week trial that concluded in November 2023. As a result, SBF was sentenced to 25 years in prison , though the U.S. government had requested a sentence between 40 and 50 years . His legal team had argued for a much shorter sentence of just six years. In response to speculation on X that SBF, the founder of FTX, might receive an early pardon from President Biden, Elon Musk responded: “I will be shocked if this doesn’t happen.” But on the Polymarket, the probability of Biden pardoning SBF is only about 5%.… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) December 23, 2024 Despite his conviction, the idea of a pardon has gained attention, mainly because of SBF’s close ties to the Democratic Party. He was one of the biggest donors to the party, which has led some to believe that his political connections might help him get a lesser sentence or even a pardon. The upcoming bankruptcy proceedings for FTX , starting in January 2025, have led some to argue that pardoning SBF could help the country move on from the scandal. Elon Musk Weighs In on the Possibility The speculation surrounding a potential pardon gained further traction after Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s comments on X. Musk tweeted that he would be “shocked if this doesn’t happen,” adding fuel to the rumors. I will be shocked if this doesn’t happen — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 23, 2024 The possibility of a pardon may have some credibility, considering President Joe Biden granted pardons to his son, Hunter Biden, on two separate charges despite earlier promises to avoid such actions. Some even pointed to the fact that six charges against SBF were dropped, sparing him a second trial. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Stephen Miran to Chair CEA: Why Trump’s Pick Is Great for Crypto! , Polymarket Predict 16% Chances Despite Musk’s confident prediction, the chances of President Biden granting a pardon to SBF seem low.

This number indicates that, according to market participants, the chances of such an event occurring are minimal. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Let’s look at some more major developments. Bitcoin (BTC) President-elect Donald Trump has reiterated his plans to sign an executive order and create a Bitcoin reserve on his first day in office. This has left many wondering how it could impact Bitcoin’s current four-year boom-bust cycle. El Salvador plans to continue buying Bitcoin (BTC) for its strategic reserve despite reaching a deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The Central American country had agreed to modify its Bitcoin policy to secure a $1.4 billion loan deal with the IMF. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has said the Federal Reserve is not allowed to own Bitcoin and does not intend to be involved in any government effort to create a Bitcoin strategic reserve. Bitcoin (BTC) surged to an all-time high on Monday, hitting $106,500 and giving buyers hope the current bull run will continue. However, indicators have signaled a highly overbought market, with a correction imminent. Bitcoin (BTC) slumped almost 6% thanks to remarks by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell after the FOMC meeting. Powell stated there would be only two rate cuts in 2025, plunging the crypto market into the red. Technology Kraken has launched its Layer2 blockchain Ink ahead of schedule. Initially set for a 2025 launch, Ink launched on mainnet on Wednesday thanks to considerable developer enthusiasm and community support. Ink was built using Optimism’s OP Stack.

Ironically, in some cases, they have even outperformed the market giants, such as Bitcoin, during the infamous November rally following Trump’s victory. For investors who desire to pursue high-profit opportunities in the crypto industry, memecoins remain a significant point of interest. This is due to their potential for both volatility and potential returns. Although memecoins are worth fractions of pennies individually, their total value sometimes runs to billions. Memes are the main direction of 2024 🧐 Alas, while the fundamental is resting, memes are accelerating only on the way. Since the beginning of 2024, the total capitalization of memcoins has increased by $93.73 billion. pic.twitter.com/t6VjY2Rhpp — To The Moon | Altcoin Gems & BTC (@ToTheMoonMemeX) December 3, 2024 Still, according to Binance, memecoins listed in 2024 experienced a large market cap rise of 80%. This has highlighted the high reward potential of memecoins despite their inherent risks. Ben Kurland from DYOR Labs said, “Meme coins are the sugar rush of the crypto world fun, flashy, and easy to digest, but they’re not exactly the healthiest long-term play.” 2024 has proven this statement as people have shown excitement for these coins, leading to a downside of great losses as well.

However, the memecoin’s price has decreased since last week, with a current price of $0.31. On Friday, Dogecoin experienced its most precipitous decline in over a month, reaching a low of $0.267. Notably, memecoin NEIRO has seen amazing growth, with its market capitalization increasing by 7,594%. In addition, the Bonk (BONK) memecoin also made headlines by breaking its all-time price record, reaching a new high of $0.000057. This allowed it to reclaim its position as the leading memecoin in the Solana ecosystem. Bonk’s price increased by more than 72% in a week. Bonk’s competitor in the Solana ecosystem, Dogwifhat, also surged by 13.7%. The token is a notable participant in the memecoin sector with a market cap that peaked at approximately $2.99B as of its most recent performance. It reached an all-time high of $4.83 earlier this year and is currently trading at approximately $1.9. Sentiment in the crypto market regarding the potential for a crypto-friendly business environment in the wake of Trump’s victory in the US presidential election was reflected in the rally in memecoins. A vast majority of memecoins were created this year, and this figure is expected to continue to rise. 2025 memecoins predictions There is speculation that Dogecoin may experience exceptional growth during a Donald Trump presidency, following the announcement of Elon Musk’s appointment to the “Department of Government Efficiency” (D.O.G.E.), which is famed for its abbreviation. Dogecoin price projections are within a high-risk range of $0.39 to $0.25. In the meantime, certain crypto analysts predict that Dogecoin may reach $0.1131 by mid-2025 and $0.1228 by the year’s closure. Also, Changelly predicted that by 2025, SHIB’s price will fluctuate between $0.0000149 and $0.0000247, with an average trade price of roughly $0.0000345. Based on the current pricing, this represents a possible return on investment of approximately 23.5%. In addition, Dogwifhat’s average price is anticipated to fall within the $5.39 to $14.72 range by 2025. Some optimistic predictions indicate that it may continue to increase. It is anticipated that January will be the most significant month for WIF, with prices potentially increasing by 392.39% in comparison to their current value. Still, Bonk (BONK) is expected to fluctuate between $0.00008783 and $0.000239. The average price for the year is anticipated to be approximately $0.000138. January has the potential to be the best month for BONK, as its value could increase by 409.53% compared to its current price. Memecoins reigned supreme in 2024. How many were actually success stories? An ever-increasing majority of memecoins fail, regardless of whether they are promoted by social media influencers, created on Pump. fun, or even if they gained popularity through the mere magic of memes. More than 75% of memecoins were created in 2024, and over 97% are dead. According to a study conducted by CoinWire, only 1% of influencers have been able to increase the value of a memecoin by tenfold. Additionally, only 3% of memecoins that are promoted by influencers will ever attain a 10x increase. The research, which analyzed 1,500 tokens promoted by 377 American Twitter influencer accounts, discovered that 76% of these influencers promoted defunct meme token projects, and 86% of those projects experienced a 90% decline within three months. The saturation of the market is of no concern to memecoin creators and investors. It pertains to the use of the present moment, with minimal regard for the future.

The price is dangerously close to the $185 support level, and as a result, traders are getting out of their positions since this is the line to a downward spiral. In this uncertainty, the DTX Exchange (DTX), a new kind of hybrid trading platform, has been taking the headlines and brought in $500K in freshly raised capital from a bunch of investors wanting a place that is safer and shows more promise. Solana A Critical Moment in SOL Price As a high-speed blockchain with a friendly ecosystem for developers, Solana has been a perennial presence in the top cryptos. However, $185 support has become the next big battleground for bulls and bears alike, as the SOL price momentum has petered out substantially over the past few weeks. At the time of writing, the SOL price is down notably from its monthly highs. If the $185 level doesn’t hold, analysts say, the next stops could be $170—or lower. As the bearish outlook continues, sentiment among investors to buy has taken a knock, prompting many to cut Solana positions and switch to other assets. However, Solana remains a blockchain space leader supporting a plethora of decentralized (dApps) while having a substantial total value locked (TVL) of $8.214 billion. However, with a decline in the SOL price and market sentiment being bearish, capital is flowing into more promising new projects, like DTX Exchange, which shows that people are becoming more and more inclined to diversify. DTX Exchange: The $10 Million Presale With Huge Inflows While the SOL price struggles, new capital has rotated to a brand new crypto exchange. DTX Exchange acts as a next-generation hybrid trading platform melding the best features of centralized (CEX) and decentralized (DEX) exchanges to allow users to trade diverse asset classes ranging from cryptocurrencies to stocks and commodities through its revolutionary interface. With a recent $500k rotation to DTX, this trailblazing presale has raised more than $10,000,000 in presale funding. Key features of DTX Exchange that prompted this inflow: VulcanX Hybrid Blockchain: VulcanX is at the heart of DTX, a proprietary Layer 1 blockchain that aims to bridge between traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi). By implementing this unique system, users can effortlessly trade over 120,000 asset classes on one single platform. Unmatched Growth Potential: DTX boasts a very affordably priced token, set at $0.12 during its presale phase. With its disruptive tech and strong adoption trajectory, analysts are predicting an impressive 15x rally post-launch. Advanced Trading Tools: DTX provides institutional-grade features, such as non-custodial storage, real-time analytics, social trading, and automated bots, to everyday traders. These tools allow users to get higher returns without losing control over their assets. Massive Market Opportunity: DTX has set its sights on a $170 billion global trading market and is well positioned to seize the growing shift towards hybrid trading solutions to become a game changer. Conclusion: A Shift in Market Dynamics Due to the current market turbulence that arose around the SOL price, the crypto scene is opened to new projects like DTX Exchange to move the investor’s attention. DTX has quickly become a top choice for both a stable and growth-oriented type of speculation in this climate. With a robust community backing and its powerful tools, DTX is a one-of-a-kind opportunity to stay agile as the market evolves.

38003964,https://invezz.com/?p=2400665,1734952381,Feeling like you missed out by not buying Ethereum at $0.66? here are 3 altcoins looking a lot like ETH of 2015,"Investors who regret not purchasing Ethereum (ETH) at $0.66 in 2015 now have a chance to find similar ground-breaking cryptocurrencies ready for explosive expansion. Today, three altcoins show possible evocative of Ethereum’s early years: Polygon (POL), TRON (TRX), and Rexas Finance (RXS). These projects have a unique opportunity for significant gains and are transforming blockchain technology. Rexas Finance (RXS): the decentralized internet alternative Rexas Finance (RXS) is a new blockchain-based platform that changes decentralized finance (DeFi) and real estate tokenizing. Rexas Finance uses modern technologies to tokenize real-world assets like property so that consumers may access quick, safe, open financial solutions. As the presale for Rexas Finance continues, the cryptocurrency community is taking notice. Currently, in stage 10, RXS is priced at $0.15 and has raised over $29.2 million and sold more than 354.4 million tokens. Its success has already won its listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, and Certik’s security audit strengthens its reputation. The platform was meant to encourage a decentralized internet, enabling developers to construct decentralized apps (dApps). This concept presents Rexas Finance as a substitute for Ethereum since it provides a more readily available ecosystem for innovation. Rexas Finance is a strong candidate for exponential development with a fast-expanding community, significant money, and a clear goal to change the internet. Should you have missed Ethereum at $0.66, RXS at $0.15 could provide your second opportunity to participate early in a revolutionary movement. TRON (TRX): revolutionizing content creation TRON has positioned itself as a blockchain pioneer by emphasizing decentralized content creation and distribution. Its platform allows users to freely create and share content while receiving digital assets as compensation. Since TRON does not impose transaction fees, it appeals more to content creators and developers than Ethereum. This function makes TRON a potent instrument for content dissemination democratizing agents. TRON’s capability to allow decentralized apps, from games to streaming, offers developers great value. Furthermore, as of writing, the live TRON price is $0.27, making it a reasonably priced choice for those looking for expansion. A growing ecosystem and substantial use cases help TRON to gain momentum progressively. Its decentralized content generation method reflects Ethereum’s early aim of enabling consumers and developers. Investors seeking a convenient point of entrance into the future of blockchain should give TRON top thought. Polygon (POL): scaling Ethereum’s vision Previously known as Matic Network, Polygon has become increasingly important in enabling Ethereum’s capacity. Designed to improve Ethereum’s efficiency while lowering its infamous transaction costs, it functions as a Layer-2 scaling fix. Its activities depend on the Polygon Ecosystem Token (POL), which helps staking, governance, and network consensus mechanism involvement. With Polygon’s live pricing at $0.59 as of writing, investors have a unique chance to enter at a reasonable cost. The platform is essential to the blockchain ecosystem because it can scale Ethereum’s capabilities. Staking POL tokens not only protects the network but also pays participants. Therefore, offering long-term investors is still another incentive. Polygonal growth has been crucial in the ecology of decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Though the network is still somewhat slow, Polygon is worth investing in over the long haul, especially given its continuous efforts to overcome the Ethereum platform’s scalability issues. Despite the recurring patterns in history, the potential loss of Ethereum at $0.66 represents a significant opportunity. Offering creative answers to long-standing problems, Rexas Finance , TRON, and Polygon are opening the path for blockchain’s next stage. Rexas Finance, TRON, and Polygon aim to develop blockchain technology by tackling Ethereum’s constraints. These initiatives change the crypto scene via scaling solutions, transaction-free content sharing, or decentralized internet services. These initiatives stand out as investments because of Rexas Finance’s decentralized internet approach, TRON’s emphasis on content production, and Polygon’s scalability. These altcoins offer a good path forward for those looking for the next Ethereum-like expansion tale. The crypto market is based on invention; early adoption usually pays off the most. Given their potential for significant expansion and original value propositions, Rexas Finance, TRON, and Polygon need a place on every investor’s radar.

Experts Share Insights on Upcoming Altcoin Season,"Toncoin (TON) price trades in the woods like most crypto assets following the recent pullback. Generally, the network’s skyrocketing growth this year has led to bulls circling in, acquiring assets as on-chain factors flip green. Market commentators have projected price bottoms and peaks alongside this week’s bear trading. On-chain analysts have hinted at a possible 280% TON price growth within current levels, being a local bottom. The yearly simple moving average (SMA) heatmap shows a price of $5.14, representing a cool zone for a further rebound. The asset has made several gains this year and remains a major driver of another bull swing. Historically, the TON price has only dropped below this average during the best market, and present levels signify a bottom due to the bull season. In recent months, TON has seen institutional flows as bulls look towards higher gains. This year, the asset is up 146% with expanding volumes and market-moving partnerships. Last week, Hong Kong’s broker OSL Digital Securities announced support for Toncoin to its OTC offerings. The move opens a channel for professional brokers to trade the asset against USD, USDT, and HKD. According to the statement, this follows the firm’s vision to expand its crypto offerings in the region to create market opportunities. A Price Jump to $19.53? The targeted bull scenario might see the TON price soar to $19.53 as institutional investors propel gains. At press time, the asset exchanges hands at $5.41, showing slight signs of recovery after low trading this week. Drawing references from the SMA365 heatmap, TON might see three price levels at different cycle stages. Per the report, the price will tap $8.74 before surging to $15.93 and a further $19.53. “ Analyzing these levels, TON has an initial potential to surge by up to 280% in an altcoin bull market. Additionally, it’s important to note that the price heatmap metric is based on a moving average. This means that during a bull cycle, as prices rise, these target levels are likely to increase correspondingly,” CryptoQuant added. Most whales are motivated by the wider market positions ahead of next year’s bull peaks. Ethereum and Solana have seen similar projections to new levels based on on-chain and institutional factors.

A standout of the performers has to be the DTX Exchange (DTX) token, which has already raised so much traction early on before listing. Market analysts and crypto enthusiasts are now speculating whether DTX could replicate the meteoric rise of Solana (SOL) from the historic 2021 bull run. Let’s explore DTX’s growth, propelled by different market factors like the general market bullish sentiment among investors looking for the next big opportunity, and how it might deliver massive upside potential, much like Solana’s legendary surge. Solana’s (SOL) Meteoric Rise: A Case Study in Crypto Explosions Such have been the standards set by Solana’s bull run, that all the fresh altcoins look to emulate it. The blockchain platform, which is fast gaining prominence for unmatchable transaction speeds and low fees, shot up from under $1 in January 2021 to an all-time high of $264 by November of the same year. That comes to a whopping 26,000% growth in under a year. Among the architects of the SOL price increase were its revolutionary blockchain architecture, rapid developer adoption, and strategic listings on the major exchanges. As Solana’s attraction was built on its understanding of scalability in blockchain, it was viewed as the new darling of DeFi and NFT platforms alike. Years on from that historic period, Solana’s price is currently not at that level, experiencing a severe drop in the past few days and standing at $183. So investors are now eyeing DTX Exchange, which has shown similar growth potential. Could it be the next to go on that type of 2021 Solana run? DTX Exchange’s (DTX) Gains Potential is Through the Roof In a very short time, DTX Exchange is becoming a top trading platform, merging traditional financial assets with cryptocurrencies. This was the first platform with the capability for seamless trading across multiple asset classes – providing over 100,000 trading instruments and privileges up to 1,000 times in leverage. Such a pioneering approach has earned a place for DTX with more than 200,000 members in late 2024. The platform’s innovative features, such as the Phoenix Wallet for multi-asset holdings and plans to tokenize real-world assets (RWAs), set it apart in the crowded crypto landscape. DTX’s presale has been a massive hit, raising around $10 million, generating up to 36,000% as an ICO in 2024. And its potential to generate profit for investors is just as massive. Early investors also benefit from incentives such as profit-sharing and voting rights, further driving demand. The current price of its presale token is 0.12 at its sixth stage, meaning early investors from the first stage have already recorded 500% in profit. And there are speculations putting the token’s price at $0.2 by the time it lists, meaning people who invest from this point could stand to gain by 66%. DTX’s potential after listing is very promising as well, with the token having tons of utility on the trading platform that is fast becoming popular among investors. The platform has passed a detailed SolidProof audit and is listed on CoinMarketCap. That focus on security and transparency boosts investor confidence and positions DTX well to attract institutional investors, much like Solana did. As DTX continues to gain traction, it could very well replicate Solana’s legendary rise, delivering life-changing returns for early investors. For those who missed out on that, DTX offers a second chance to get in early on a project with massive potential. DTX Exchange is not just another altcoin project; it is a transformative platform that bridges the gap between traditional and digital finance.

Although it has lost its momentum, especially in the past week or so, history shows that its most spectacular price surge during this cycle could still be around the corner. DOGEUSD. Source: TradingView Can DOGE Pull a 2021-Like Rally? Perhaps due to its affiliation with Elon Musk and his upcoming role in Donald Trump’s administration, Dogecoin skyrocketed after the US presidential elections. Its price exploded by more than 200% from its aforementioned bottom to $0.485 on December 8. After these quite impressive gains, though, DOGE started to retrace but still maintained the $0.4 level. However, that all changed last week when the market-wide crash pushed it south hard. In just a few days, DOGE’s price tumbled by nearly 40% to $0.26. Although such a massive correction sounds painful, it is not something unheard of for the crypto market, especially in the ever-volatile meme coin sector. Similar enhanced fluctuations have transpired in the past as well, which could actually suggest a more favorable future for DOGE. Popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez compared the recent crash to similar developments that took place during the bull cycles in 2017 and 2021. In both instances, the largest meme coin surged by triple-digits, retraced by 40-60%, and then shot up by four or even five digits by the end of the respective runs. In 2017, when #Dogecoin began a parabolic run, it surged 212%, retraced 40%, then rallied 5,000%. In 2021, it went up 476%, retraced 56%, then skyrocketed 12,000%. Now, in 2024, $DOGE is up 440% and has retraced by 46%. If history repeats, another parabolic rally is on the way! pic.twitter.com/uhf2kMc0Id — Ali (@ali_charts) December 23, 2024 Can DOGE Soar Above $10? Skyrocketing by 5,000% or 12,000% sounds quite bullish, but let’s look at these predictions more realistically. In 2017 and 2021, DOGE’s price was a lot more modest, and posting such massive gains seemed easier, at least on paper. If the OG meme coin is to surge by similar percentages from now on, its price and market cap would have to go to the stratosphere. For example, a 5,000% increase would put its price at over $13, and the market cap would be at over $1.9 trillion – or bigger than bitcoin’s current one. If DOGE repeats the 2021 gains, then its price would go all the way up to $31-32, and its market capitalization would be north of $4.5 trillion – bigger than Apple’s. Although these numbers sound quite far-fetched and history is no indicator of future price performances, this doesn’t necessarily mean that DOGE has peaked during this cycle. Dogecoin is still far away from its all-time high registered in 2021, and many other assets have managed to break their peaks, so DOGE might still have a lot of room for growth.

At this point, Tesla CEO Elon Musk also joined the X speculation that FTX founder SBF could be pardoned early by President Joe Biden. Elon Musk stated in a post on his X account that Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), the founder of the bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX and one of the largest donors to US Democrats, may receive an early pardon from US President Joe Biden. Musk then said he would be shocked if Biden did not pardon SBF early, adding, “I would be shocked if that doesn't happen.” Rumors that Biden could pardon SBF have caused a surge in the FTX Token (FTT) price. Following the news, the probability that Biden will pardon SBF increased from 5% to 9% on Polymarket. As is known, SBF was sentenced to 25 years in prison for multiple crimes, including fraud. SBF recently filed a court appeal against his fraud conviction, claiming that the judge overseeing his case was unfairly biased against him. However, the appeal was rejected by US authorities.

Conclusion The battle for crypto dominance is heating up as Solana and BNB enter beast mode, vying to reclaim their ATH. Since the US’s political shift, Solana’s price has been on steroids at the heel of positive ecosystem development and institutional interest. BNB, too, has been exceptionally impressive. BNB clinched a new ATH, and the stakes have never been higher. Which of these DeFi giants will crush its ATH first? Or can this new crypto threaten to disrupt the leaderboard and eventually take the lead? Read on to learn more. Solana price faces a decline: Can it break ATH before BNB? Solana’s price has been impressive all year, and its PoH ecosystem has dominated headlines. But this once high-flying blockchain has hit a stumbling block after recording a 17% dip. The decline in Solana’s price came at the heels of the Federal Reserve Chair’s hawkish decision. But beneath the price slump is a vibrant story of Solana’s brilliance. This year, Solana’s dApp revenue has skyrocketed 15x from DeFi and meme growth. Even TVL reached a new high. Can it harness this momentum to reclaim its ATH before BNB? With resistance at $230 and key support at $190, the race is on. BNB gets bullish outlook off soaring staking TVL and whale activity BNB is getting a bullish outlook on its ecosystem wins, especially the recent BNSOL liquid staking and renewed institutional interest.

38003963,https://invezz.com/?p=2400648,1734951775,"Three altcoins ready to pump with Ethereum (ETH) in 2025 as it aims for $15,000 in Q1 2025","After breaking its $4000 bottleneck, Ethereum is expected to rally toward $15,000 in 2025, potentially leading to an altcoin season. Rexas Finance , Aptos, and Cardano are among the leading altcoins to surge alongside Ethereum, each with solid fundamentals and market momentum to provide big rewards for investors. Rexas Finance (RXS) Rexas Finance is taking the lead in real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, with valuations expected to reach trillions. The Rexas blockchain technology democratizes illiquid assets, including real estate, commodities, and art. By converting ownership to digital tokens, these assets become more liquid, transparent, and accessible to global investors. The RXS coin, which is exclusive to the Rexas Finance ecosystem, has had an outstanding presale performance. Its previous nine stages sold out ahead of schedule, and Stage 10 is now 92% complete, with RXS priced at $0.15. This performance demonstrates great investor confidence, with $30 million raised and 352 million tokens sold to date. The Rexas team announced earlier that after the presale, RXS will list on at least three of the top 10 crypto exchanges for $0.20, positioning it for immediate gains post-launch. Rexas Finance offers user-friendly solutions such as the Rexas Token Builder, a no-code tokenization tool, and the QuickMint Bot, which easily integrates token generation into platforms such as Telegram and Discord. Furthermore, its AI-powered security technology, Rexas AI Shield, protects smart contracts and fosters investor trust. The project has undergone a Certik audit, which confirms its reliability. Also, Rexas Finance is hosting a $1 million giveaway with twenty winners, each poised to earn $50,000. This event has seen over 550,000 entries, indicating high community interest. Experts believe that the anticipated mega listing on top exchanges will propel RXS past $20 by 2025, offering great upside potential when it hits the market. Also, as an ERC token, Rexas Finance is expected to surge exponentially as Ethereum rallies toward the $15,000 milestone. Aptos(APT) Layer-1 blockchain leader Aptos (APT) is rising. Institutional investors and DeFi fans are increasingly drawn to Aptos’ scalability and developer-friendly architecture. APT’s attractiveness has increased due to Binance’s native USDT integration, which has improved transaction efficiency and liquidity. Aptos has also grown abroad, opening a new office in Abu Dhabi’s ADGM. This strategic move positions the initiative to capitalize on the Middle East’s booming blockchain sector. Anchorage Digital’s support for tokenized treasury on Aptos strengthens its position as a hub for institutional-grade DeFi solutions. Analysts predict Aptos will leverage on its strong Total Value Locked (TVL), which increased by 60% in Q4 2024, reaching new highs. Aptos expects a breakout to $20 in 2025, suggesting a considerable increase from its current price of $8. Cardano(ADA) Cardano continues to gather traction as it expands its ecosystem to unimaginable heights. The Hydra protocol implementation increased Cardano’s scalability to 1 million transactions per second (TPS), drawing a new wave of developers and DeFi initiatives to its platform. On-chain data shows Cardano’s TVL grew from $230 million to $705 million in December 2024. Due to significant growth and institutional interest, analysts predict ADA’s price will reach $5–10 by 2025. Cardano whales have over $110 million in ADA despite recent dips, indicating long-term optimism. Institutional adoption and speculation about Cardano ETFs support the optimistic outlook. As the market rises, ADA will remain one of the top altcoins to rally alongside Ethereum in 2025. Rexas Finance, Aptos, and Cardano can profit from Ethereum’s goal of $15,000 by 2025. Each project has solid fundamentals, real-world use cases, and institutional support, making it a good bull cycle investment. With its novel RWA tokenization technology and explosive presale performance, Rexas Finance is well-positioned to provide astonishing rewards. Early investors stand to gain from the company’s impending tier-1 exchange listings and quickly expanding ecosystem.

Analyst Weighs In","As 2024 nears its conclusion, Ethereum price fluctuations are being closely monitored. The trajectory of the cryptocurrency is critically influenced by key resistance and support levels, as indicated by recent analysis from crypto experts, which suggests a cautiously optimistic outlook. Related Reading: Ethereum Adoption Grows As BlackRock ETF Secures 1 Million ETH Important Price Levels To Monitor Analyzing cryptocurrencies, Justin Bennett emphasized the importance of Ethereum recovering the $3,540 level over the weekly period on December 22. This pricing range is regarded as necessary to show a potential change in the market toward optimism. Should Ethereum be unable to clear this barrier, it runs the danger of sliding below the significant support zone of $3,000, leading to a drop toward $2,600. For investors as well as speculators, a drop of this degree would be costly. As bullish as I’m turning with the overall setup going into 2025, buyers still have work to do. For example, $ETH needs to recover $3,540 on the weekly time frame to look bullish next week. Buyers have 33 hours to get it done.#Ethereum pic.twitter.com/cAChCbJxjd — Justin Bennett (@JustinBennettFX) December 21, 2024 Market Sentiment And Analyst Predictions The analysis by Titan of Crypto who utilized the Ichimoku cloud approach to predict probable recovery further strengthens the optimism surrounding Ethereum. The analyst noted that Ethereum has retested some critical levels, which gives the impression that the present correction cycle is about nearing its end. The strength of Kumo Cloud’s support line indicates that Ethereum may well form a base for higher moves if it can manage to hold on to the existing levels. Whales Ramp Up Accumulation Meanwhile, Ethereum whales have increased their holdings and amassed about 340,000 ETH, which is worth more than $1 billion, in just a few days. This rise in accumulation shows that big investors are becoming more confident of the prospects of the altcoin. Ethereum Whales Bought $1 Billion ETH In The Past 96 Hours – Details https://t.co/fZe8jWmQ3S — Jose JM (@CryptoJoseJM) December 22, 2024 In addition, spot Ethereum ETFs have garnered inflows of over $2 billion since their introduction in the US market, which is indicative of the growing interest in these instruments. If regulatory authorities permit staking yields within these funds, analysts anticipate that this trend could surpass Bitcoin ETFs by 2025. Ethereum Price Forecast At the time of writing, Ether was trading at $3,330, down 0.7% and 15.7% in the daily and weekly timeframes, data from Coingecko shows. Based on how the Ethereum market is doing right now, there will likely be a positive upward trend within the next week, despite Ether’s numbers flashing red in the charts. Analysts are hopeful about its chances of recovering, even though it is selling at a 21% discount to what they think it will be worth in a month. Source: CoinCheckup A potential breakout that could test critical resistance levels is being indicated by technical indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Averages. Ethereum is anticipated to experience a robust development trajectory in the medium to long term, with a 35% price increase within the next three months and a remarkable 100% growth within a year, according to projections.

With an average acquisition price of $75,600 per Bitcoin, the firm’s bold strategy reflects its commitment to integrating Bitcoin into its financial operations. From Bitcoin Accumulation to Profitable Operations Metaplanet’s Bitcoin acquisition strategy is paying dividends for its shareholders. The firm reported a staggering 310% BTC Yield between October and December, a dramatic increase from the 41.7% yield in the preceding quarter. BTC Yield is Metaplanet’s proprietary metric for evaluating the performance of its Bitcoin strategy, which aims to enhance shareholder value. In a significant shift, the company announced plans to establish Bitcoin accumulation and management as a core business line. This new focus includes exploring financial instruments such as loans, equity, and convertible bonds to further bolster its Bitcoin holdings. After years of losses, Metaplanet is projecting its first operating profit since 2017 , signaling that its Bitcoin-focused strategy could be a sustainable path forward. The firm has also raised $62 million (9.5 billion Japanese yen) through a stock acquisition program to expand its Bitcoin reserves, reinforcing its long-term confidence in the cryptocurrency’s potential. Market Reactions News of the $60 million Bitcoin purchase caused a 5% surge in Metaplanet’s stock on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Despite a slight decline in stock value over the past week, shares in the company have skyrocketed by over 2,100% this year, hitting an all-time high in mid-December. As Metaplanet integrates Bitcoin into its treasury strategy and positions itself as a leader in Bitcoin accumulation, its moves are being closely watched by both crypto enthusiasts and traditional investors.

38002136,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=631358,1734951600,Could Lightchain AI Outpace Dogecoin (DOGE) in 2025? Analysts Weigh In,"As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, analysts are starting to weigh in on the potential of Lightchain AI (LCAI) to surpass established tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE) in 2025. While DOGE remains popular for its community-driven appeal and meme status, Lightchain AI offers a more innovative approach by merging artificial intelligence (AI) with blockchain technology. With its unique Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism, Lightchain AI rewards nodes for performing valuable AI computations, optimizing both blockchain security and performance. Additionally, its Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) supports decentralized AI model training and real-time analytics. Currently in its presale phase at an affordable $0.003, LCAI has attracted significant investor interest. As Lightchain AI continues to grow and develop, many believe it could outperform DOGE in the coming years due to its technological advantages and real-world applications. In this article, we’ll explore the potential of Lightchain AI and its ability to outpace Dogecoin in 2025. The Rise of Lightchain AI Lightchain AI is emerging as a groundbreaking force in the cryptocurrency market by integrating artificial intelligence (AI) with blockchain technology. Unlike traditional blockchain platforms, which focus primarily on decentralization and security, Lightchain AI enhances these qualities by incorporating advanced AI capabilities that optimize network performance and scalability. Its Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism uniquely rewards nodes for performing complex AI computations, such as model training and data analysis, driving further innovation and efficiency. The Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) enables seamless execution of AI tasks on the blockchain, empowering decentralized AI applications. With a presale token priced attractively at $0.003, Lightchain AI has already garnered significant attention from investors looking to capitalize on the platform’s potential. The innovative combination of AI and blockchain offers substantial growth prospects, particularly in industries such as finance, healthcare, and supply chain management, positioning Lightchain AI for widespread adoption and long-term success. The Popularity of Dogecoin Dogecoin (DOGE) has gotten a lot of fame in recent times, mostly because of its group-focused style and meme value. Made first as a laugh, DOGE has turned into one of the best coins by market size and still pulls in new users with its small fees and quick processing. But, some critics say that DOGE does not have big tech leaps when matched to other coins which makes some experts wonder about its future chances to grow. As the world of digital money changes and rivals grow, it’s key for tokens such as DOGE to keep making new things and changing to hold onto their spot. With Lightchain AI coming up as a tough͏ player in the market, it’s good to think if DOGE can stay up with them in the next years. Lightchain AI vs. Dogecoin: The Technological Advantage Lightchain AI (LCAI) distinguishes itself from Dogecoin (DOGE) through its innovative integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with blockchain technology, offering a technological advantage that sets it apart in the cryptocurrency landscape. While DOGE has gained popularity as a meme-based cryptocurrency with a strong community following, its technological infrastructure remains relatively basic, primarily utilizing a Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism. In contrast, Lightchain AI employs a Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism, rewarding nodes for performing valuable AI computations such as model training and optimization. This approach enhances network efficiency and scalability, addressing key challenges faced by traditional blockchain platforms. Additionally, Lightchain AI’s Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) enables the execution of complex AI tasks directly on the blockchain, facilitating real-time analytics and decentralized AI model training. These technological advancements position Lightchain AI as a forward-thinking solution with the potential to revolutionize various industries, including finance, healthcare, and supply chain management. Whose Future is Brighter? While Dogecoin has certainly captured the attention of the cryptocurrency community, Lightchain AI’s technological advantages and real-world potential suggest that it could potentially outpace DOGE in 2025. With its unique blend of AI and blockchain technology, Lightchain AI offers a more innovative approach that addresses key challenges faced by traditional cryptocurrencies. As its presale phase continues and development progresses, it will be interesting to see how these two tokens compare and whether Lightchain AI will emerge as a dominant force in the market. So, lightchain AI definitely has a brighter future with its potential for widespread adoption and real-world applications.

38001928,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=632161,1734951581,FTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) to get a Presidential pardon from Biden before January 20,"Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), the infamous crypto billionaire turned convict, will soon be a free man if rumors of a presidential pardon hold true. It all started after Wall Street Mav tweeted , “Guess who might get an early pardon from President Biden. The #2 largest donor to the Democrats.” As if that wasn’t enough, Elon Musk (arguably the most powerful person in Trump’s incoming administration) fanned the flames, saying , “I will be shocked if this doesn’t happen.” SBF is currently rotting in Mendota Federal Prison, serving a 25-year sentence for orchestrating one of the most outrageous financial scandals in modern history. Convicted in November 2023 on charges of fraud and conspiracy, his case is already a political minefield. Throw in talk of a pardon, and now we’re playing with fireworks. From crypto king to inmate number who-knows At his peak, SBF was untouchable. He launched FTX in 2019 and built it into a $32 billion empire in like two years. Over a million users trusted their assets to this guy’s platform. Then November 2022 happened. FTX imploded faster than a meme coin on rug-pull day. Customers rushed to withdraw billions, triggering a liquidity crisis. Within days, the exchange filed for bankruptcy, and SBF was arrested in the Bahamas on a US extradition request. Fast forward to 2023, and things got even worse. Prosecutors said SBF had looted billions from FTX users to plug holes at Alameda Research, his hedge fund. The funds also covered personal luxuries, including a $30 million penthouse in the Bahamas. SBF’s defense team painted him as a naive nerd who got in over his head. The jury wasn’t buying it. By March this year, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison and slapped with an $11.02 billion forfeiture. Even with time reductions for good behavior under federal rules, SBF will be in his 40s before he breathes free air. That is unless President Joe Biden has other plans. I mean, we did just watch him pardon his son, Hunter Biden. This is not out of pocket. Why Biden might step in But SBF didn’t just run a crypto exchange, he ran political donations like a boss. In just 18 months, he shelled out over $70 million to political campaigns, making him one of America’s top donors ever. More than half of that, about $40 million, went straight to Democrats during the 2022 midterms. That’s second only to George Soros. His cash wasn’t spread around for nothing. The Protect Our Future PAC, which promotes pandemic preparedness, got $27 million. The House Majority PAC took $6 million. Even the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) pocketed $250,000. High-profile pro-crypto Democrats like Kirsten Gillibrand, Cory Booker, and Maggie Hassan each received $5,800, the maximum individual contribution allowed. But he apparently didn’t forget the Republicans . He claimed to have donated similar amounts to GOP candidates, but he used dark money to avoid scrutiny. If true, those donations might match or even outpace what he gave to the Democrats. Exact figures are anyone’s guess, but we’re talking tens of millions. Is it any wonder Biden might feel the heat? Whether it’s gratitude, pressure from SBF’s political beneficiaries, a desire to take the spotlight off Trump a little bit, or something else entirely, the pardon rumors are growing louder. Jail time, appeals, and the road ahead without pardon After his sentencing, SBF was shipped off to Mendota , a federal prison in California. The facility offers medium and minimum security housing. It’s not exactly Rikers, but it’s still prison. Privacy rules keep details about his living conditions under wraps, but this much is clear: SBF isn’t having any more of his alleged penthouse sex parties anymore. His lawyers are busy filing appeals. They argue procedural mistakes during the trial violated his rights. Appeals in federal court rarely succeed—only 10% of cases even get a second look. Still, SBF is banking on his legal team to at least shave years off his sentence. Thanks to the First Step Act, a federal law dedicated to reducing sentences for nonviolent offenders, SBF could cut his time behind bars by a very long margin. If he earns maximum good-behavior credits, he might be out in as little as 12.5 years. But that’s a big “if.” Public reaction and current sentiment on SBF Not everyone’s buying into the redemption arc. Victims of FTX’s collapse, who collectively lost billions, see SBF as the face of betrayal. John Ray, the man tasked with cleaning up SBF’s mess at the exchange, has repeatedly emphasized the harm caused by SBF’s actions. Meanwhile, SBF’s defense team insists the crime was “victimless,” a claim that’s as convincing as a hot dog being called a sandwich. Meanwhile, a YouGov survey shows 37% of Americans view SBF favorably. Thirteen percent see him unfavorably. The rest? They’re either unaware or couldn’t care less. Among those familiar with his trial, 73% believe he should be behind bars. If Biden does grant a pardon, the backlash could be brutal. Critics would accuse him of cronyism, especially given SBF’s financial ties to the Democratic Party . On the other hand, the White House might see it differently. Pardons often serve political purposes.

Hamster Kombat S2 Coming Soon! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The recent surge that added 240 million players to Hamster Kombat (HMTR) made headlines and set high expectations for the HMSTR token. But can it repeat this historic rally? Currently trading at $0.002693, the token is facing a major challenge: it needs to rise by more than 73% to hit $0.01 before 2025. While such gains have been achieved before, the current market environment is far from ideal. Hey Hamsters! We know you’ve been waiting for this one… We would like to finally give you a taste of what’s coming in Season 2! Our ideas and ambitions pushed us to spend all the past weeks building this. Season 2 will be more than just a game, it turned out much bigger… pic.twitter.com/KIwZfQRahs — Hamster Kombat (@hamster_kombat) December 22, 2024 With Bitcoin showing signs of further decline, will HMSTR manage to defy the odds? Read on to find out. The Rise and Fall of HMSTR The announcement of the Hamster Kombat S2 beta temporarily boosted the token’s price, creating some excitement. The introduction of a $3k prize pool drew attention and gave the token a short-term boost. However, despite the buzz around S2, the price quickly fell due to heavy selling, and interest in the game started to drop. What Went Wrong? Once boasting an active user base of 300 million, Hamster Kombat now struggles with only 27 million pHamster Kombat, once boasting an active user base of 300 million, now struggles with just 27 million players. This sharp decline, along with Binance delisting the token due to low trading activity, shows the broader challenges HMSTR is facing. The drop in player interest is one of the token’s biggest issues. The game, which started as a popular Telegram-based mini-game with a tap-to-earn feature, has seen a steep fall in users. Despite this, the developers remain hopeful that the full launch of Hamster Kombat S2 can bring back interest and attract new players. Is $0.01 Still Possible for HMSTR? With just days left before 2025, HMSTR’s journey to $0.01 looks uncertain. The token’s price has consolidated, and the lack of a bullish market—especially with Bitcoin potentially facing further drops—adds to the challenge. HMSTR’s last big rally happened when the overall market was doing well, but that doesn’t seem likely at the moment. The full launch of Hamster Kombat S2 could be a game-changer for HMSTR. While the beta version sparked some interest, it’s the full-season launch that might drive a lasting rally. Season 2 will introduce new games and lay the groundwork for HamsterVerse, which could help revive interest in the game and attract new players. Can Season 2 Turn Things Around? For Hamster Kombat to reach a new all-time high (ATH), it needs more players. This may depend on how successful the Beta version is. While the company says the Beta will exceed expectations, market signals so far suggest otherwise. Whether this phase can give HMSTR the boost it needs remains to be seen. Success can be fleeting in the crypto world – but with the right moves, HMSTR could still make a comeback .",NEGATIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING | BNB | ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/can-hamster-kombat-s2-ignite-a-comeback-for-hmstr-token/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

XRP rose 328% and HBAR skyrocketed 457% since then. President-elect Donald Trump has exposure to XRP and HBAR as well. XRP and Hedera (HBAR) are among the best performers in the crypto market since a pro-crypto candidate won the 2024 United States presidential elections on November 5. While XRP gained 328%, HBAR climbed 457% since then. CoinMarketCap data shows XRP was ranked third among digital assets, hitting multi-year highs in early December.

Among the hottest coins are Rexas Finance (RXS), Ripple(XRP), Sui (SUI), Mantra (OM), Dai (DAI), and Filecoin (FIL). These coins have different use cases; however, they are all expected to perform exceedingly well during the bull market. Rexas Finance (RXS): Tokenization of Real-World Assets Rexas Finance is an ERC-20 token that enables everyday investors to gain exposure to high-value assets. With the advent of tokenization, RXS allows users to own portions of expensive assets like real estate, gold, and artworks in a completely novel way. The project encompasses Rexas Launchpad, which finances decentralized projects, and the Rexas Token Builder, which enables users to create unique tokens, further reinforcing RXS as a one-stop solution for asset tokenization. RXS’s presale was a major success, selling over 354 million tokens and raising over $29 million. Such amounts contributed to the presale’s success. The project, however, has turned down VC backing to focus on being community-driven. RXS is currently in the tenth phase of its presale stage, with a price set at $0.15, and expects a significant exchange listing within the next month priced at $0.20. Additionally, by undergoing a Certik audit, Rexas Finance ensures transparency and security, earning investors’ trust. Further, to add visibility, Rexas Finance is currently running a $1 million giveaway, where it plans to reward 20 lucky participants with RXS tokens worth $50,000 each. Through Ether and USDT, you can acquire RXS by linking ERC-20 wallets like Trust Wallet or MetaMask through the project’s interface. Ripple (XRP): Cross-Border Payment Made Easy For $2.42 and a market cap of $138.6 billion, it is safe to say XRP is a leader in financial blockchain technologies. The prospect of completing foreign exchange transactions in no time is an added advantage in its acceptance amongst banks and other financial institutions. Recently, the firm has recorded good results, especially with its plans to participate in global tokenization efforts, which will add to its growth potential in the upcoming bull run. Sui (SUI): A High-Performance Blockchain Network Sui is a next-generation Layer 1 blockchain for decentralized apps (dApps). The price for Sui is $4.61, with a market cap of $13.49 billion, which means this asset is just starting to make its way to developers. Its construction is designed to support large applications with essential scalability and low fees. As the adoption of blockchain technology increases, Sui could become a big hit during its bull phase because of its focus on ease of use and performance. Mantra (OM): Enabling Decentralized Finance Mantra began as a DeFi ecosystem that offers staking, lending, and governance services. It sells at $3.86 with its market cap at $3.653 billion, which best suits investors looking for opportunities to earn passive income within the DeFi sector. Also, the platform’s followers appreciate its transparency and user empowerment approach. With the growth of the DeFi, Mantra has promising prospects, and coupled with the bull market, its value can rise. Dai (DAI): A Multipurpose Stablecoin Dai is a decentralized stablecoin, and its exchange value is $0.99. Centralized stablecoins are centrally controlled, but Dai’s control is via smart contracts, thus increasing transparency and decreasing centralization. The total capitalization of DAI amounts to 5.36 billion dollars and has great acceptance across many DeFi platforms for lending, borrowing, and yield farming. This makes it appealing to investors since the risks attached to investing in the market are minimal, while returns earned during investment are assured. Filecoin (FIL): Toward Decentralization of the Data Storage Space Industry With a price of $6.68, Filecoin (FIL) has a market capitalization of $4.08 billion. It creates a platform where potential demands for cost-effective and reliable data storage are met. Moreover, the model enables users to rent their excess capacity, making it self-sustaining. The increasing global demand for data has opened new fronts for Filecoin, which is expected to create marvelous opportunities for price appreciation. Conclusion As the bull market approaches, Rexas Finance, Ripple, Sui, Mantra, Dai, and Filecoin are some coins that should be in holders’ portfolios. Each coin is different and can provide advantages spread across investment portfolios. Rexas Finance indeed goes up with growing attention on asset tokenization, socially driven development, and business logic. These tokens can turn $1,000 into $5,000,000. This money-multiplying potential is ideal for investors targeting explosive growth during the bull run.

Musk the Manipulator (MUSKMANI), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKMANI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk the Manipulator can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk the Manipulator could become the next viral memecoin. Musk the Manipulator launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk the Manipulator on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk the Manipulator by entering its contract address – DZpfk5LaLrnP6vSFJnLSMAopUuTJGiFk7543rQxh4ids – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKMANI.

38003235,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52925,1734950934,XRP Is Creating Squares On Daily Chart. Here’s the Significance,"XRP, the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has captured significant attention following its sustained rally above $2. For the first time since 2018, XRP has crossed this critical threshold, recently peaking at $2.86. Market participants now closely monitor the asset as it enters a potential consolidation phase as various technical and fundamental indicators point to continued momentum. Random Crypto Pal (@RandomCryptoPal), a crypto analyst on X, recently shared a notable observation. The analyst posted a chart showing XRP’s daily price movements, depicting the formation of triangles and a consolidation pattern showing squares over the past few days. #XRP is creating SQUARES on 1D chart!! Do you know what that means?? pic.twitter.com/JlNHyDxaWc — Random Crypto Pal (@RandomCryptoPal) December 22, 2024 What Does This Pattern Mean? The pattern often signifies indecision in the market, leading to a breakout in either direction. For XRP holders, this could present an opportunity if the breakout aligns with the ongoing bullish sentiment. XRP’s price has established support near $2.20 as indicated by the chart. The consolidation triangle, a classic continuation pattern, suggests that volatility may soon return. Historically, this setup has often preceded significant price moves, and given the current macro and technical trends, a bullish breakout could propel XRP toward testing new highs above $3. Market participants will likely watch this closely in the coming days as the asset approaches the triangle’s apex. If it can cross $3 and hit $3.288 as another analyst recently predicted, that could begin a run to $27 . We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Positive Momentum and Notable Developments The upward movement in XRP’s price coincides with broader optimism in the cryptocurrency space. One of the most impactful recent announcements is the resignation of SEC Chair Gary Gensler , scheduled for January 20, 2025. His tenure created regulatory challenges for the crypto industry, most notably the lawsuit against Ripple. The nomination of Paul Atkins, a crypto-friendly advocate, as Gensler’s successor has further fueled optimism. Analysts anticipate that the incoming administration will adopt a less adversarial stance on crypto-related matters, potentially ending the SEC’s prolonged legal battle with Ripple. Although there’s a chance the asset could fall if it cannot hold above the resistance, other analysts have also shown bullish signals on XRP’s chart. XRP is currently trading at $2.18, this consolidation could lead to massive gains if the digital asset can break out.

38001366,https://finbold.com/?p=221952,1734950672,Stellar (XLM) set for an imminent rally,"Trading since Wednesday , December 18, proved an uncomfortable reminder of the persistent volatility – perhaps even fragility – of even the strongest cryptocurrency bull runs. Despite the significant downturn that is, by press time on December 23, proving difficult to shake off, few investors and analysts believe that digital assets have topped this cycle and, indeed, most now look to the coming weeks and months for a renewed rally. Technical analysis ( TA ), as applied to Stellar ( XLM ) by the popular on-chain expert Ali Martinez, appears to back the mid and long-term optimism, and the token might, in fact, be poised for an imminent upswing. XLM chart showing the TD Sequential buy signal. Source: Ali Martinez Why XLM is poised for a rally Specifically, in a December 22 X post, Martinez explained that a technical analysis tool called TD Sequential is sending a buy signal for XLM, offering a chance for a rebound toward – and possibly beyond – the recent highs near $0.55. TD Sequential is used to gauge whether the current trend will persist or experience a reversal based on the historical performance of the asset. Martinez, however, added that there is a prerequisite for such a rally – a sustained holding above the critical support zone at $0.33. Fortunately for Stellar bulls, the token is trading somewhat comfortably above the level with XLM price today of $0.35977. XLM 7-day price chart. Source: Finbold Why an imminent XLM rally is not guaranteed Still, it is worth pointing out that the sum of the many technical analysis tools and indicators is not yet decisively bullish on Stellar. For example, the relative strength index ( RSI ), despite being on the optimistic side, remains relatively neutral at 43.78. Some tools – such as the volume-weighted moving average (VWMA) and the Hull moving average – remain fixed on the ‘sell’ side. Ultimately, despite TD Sequential’s ‘buy’ flash, XLM’s true test is yet to come as the token approaches its nearest resistance level near $0.38 – an uncertain prospect at press time as the last 24 hours of trading led to a 2.07% price decline.

38004215,https://cryptonews.com/?p=321909,1734950635,Data Firm CoinMarketCap Adds New Metrics for Token Launches,"CoinMarketCap, a provider of crypto market data, will add new tools to analyse token launches, said the firm in a blog post. Two new metrics will be added in 2025 to its platform. The updates are designed to provide users with insights into the potential selling pressure associated with recently launched cryptoassets. Tokens With Low Float Create Market Volatility The tools will address concerns surrounding tokens with low float and high fully diluted valuations (FDV), which create market volatility. The two new metrics are: “Unlocked Circulating Supply” (UCS) and “Unlocked Market Capitalization” (UMC). FDV is the total market capitalization if all tokens are in circulation. A high FDV relative to MCAP may lead to significant supply inflation and sell-side pressure, said the data firm. “In recent months, we’ve observed tokens launching at high valuations with low initial float,” said Rush Lu, CEO of CoinMarketCap in a blog post. “UCS and UMC are designed to provide traders with better tools to anticipate these risks,” said Rush. Through UCS and UMC, users will gain more understanding of how much supply could potentially be sold in the market at any given time.

38001423,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=632175,1734950518,Why is Justin Sun offloading Ethereum? Sun does away with 50% ETH Holdings,"Tron founder Justin Sun has made significant Ethereum sales amid a sharp downturn in the cryptocurrency’s price. Over the past seven days, Sun has sold 50% of his Ethereum holdings, valued at approximately $143 million, following Ethereum’s rejection at the $4,000 level. Blockchain analytics platform Spot On Chain reported that Sun recently redeemed 39,999 ETH from liquid staking platforms like Lido Finance and EtherFi. These funds were subsequently deposited into HTX, fueling speculation about his strategy. Justin Sun’s recent market activity has added to Ethereum’s (ETH) woes this week. The coin has shed 17% in the last seven days and is trading at $3,304. Analysts are predicting further declines below the $3,000 mark in the coming days. Sun’s Ethereum liquidation strategy: Profits or losses? According to Spot On Chain, since November 10, Sun has offloaded a total of 108,919 ETH, worth $400 million, at an average price of $3,674 per ETH. Many of his transactions have occurred near local market highs, which shows that the Tron founder is executing a calculated profit-taking approach. 🚨 Over the past 7 days, Justin Sun ( @justinsuntron ) redeemed 39,999 $ETH ($143M) from Lido Finance and Etherfi and deposited it all to #HTX . 🔄💰 pic.twitter.com/pUSDQgZtRC — SmartWhalesAI (@SmartwhalesAI) December 23, 2024 Moreover, reports indicate Sun is unstaking an additional 42,904 ETH, valued at $139 million, from Lido Finance. This could lead to further selling pressure in the days ahead. Between February and August 2024, Sun spent an estimated $1.19 billion to accumulate 392,474 ETH, distributed across three separate wallets. Despite the recent sell-offs, his holdings have yielded a 29% return on investment, translating to a profit of approximately $349 million. Market sentiment and price movement Ethereum’s price action has reflected bearish sentiment across the broader cryptocurrency market. Over the past 24 hours, ETH has declined an additional 2.19%, with trading volume dropping by 8.57%. Prominent crypto analyst IncomeSharks attributed the sluggish activity to a “low volume weekend” and heightened stock market volatility. Despite this, the On-Balance Volume (OBV) indicator suggests that recent buyers are still in profit and providing some price support. Source: TradingView However, the overall market outlook remains pessimistic, particularly with large holders like Sun continuing to sell. Analysts note that this could exacerbate downward pressure on Ethereum’s price, especially if key support levels are breached. Technical analysis highlights bearish and bullish scenarios Ethereum is navigating a critical phase as 2024 draws to a close. The cryptocurrency reached an annual high of $4,101 earlier this year but has since fallen below pivotal thresholds. ETH is currently trading below the $3,500 mark and the 100-hourly simple moving average (SMA), with technical insights pointing to a short-term bearish trend . Per recent analysis from TradingView, resistance levels at $3,420 and $3,500 are pivotal for a potential recovery, while key support levels include $3,200, $3,120, and the psychologically significant $3,000 mark. A break below $3,000 could accelerate the bearish momentum, while a successful climb above $3,420 might set the stage for further gains toward $3,650. Source: TradingView Amid the bearish signals, some analysts see a glimmer of optimism. ‘I am Crypto Wolf,’ a notable crypto analyst, highlighted the potential formation of an inverse head-and-shoulders (iHS) pattern on Ethereum’s price chart. According to this outlook, the cryptocurrency could experience a bullish continuation if the pattern is completed successfully. Source: TradingView Additionally, Ethereum continues to attract institutional interest, particularly through exchange-traded fund (ETF) products, which could mean the market is optimistic about a price rally in the near future. Recent data shows that in the last trading week, running from December 16 to 20, total net ETH ETF inflows hit $62.73 million, adding to a positive momentum for four consecutive weeks.

38004214,https://cryptonews.com/?p=321901,1734950424,Elon Musk Predicts President Biden Will Pardon SBF Despite 5% Odds on Polymarket,"In a surprising twist of debate, Elon Musk has commented on the ongoing speculation surrounding the fate of Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), the disgraced founder of FTX , on getting a pardon. In response to an X post about Bankman-Fried’s past as the second-largest donor to the Democratic Party, Musk commented , “I will be shocked if this doesn’t happen.” I will be shocked if this doesn’t happen — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 23, 2024 Musk’s comment has attracted increased attention from observers who believe that SBF’s political contributions and connections could influence the justice system. However, current betting markets on Polymarket suggest only a 5% – 10% chance of a pardon. Elon Musk Predicts SBF Would Be Pardoned: Can Polymarket Be Wrong This Time? The discussion originated from a wager on Polymarket that began circulating in April. The wager questioned whether Biden would exercise his presidential powers to pardon, commute, or grant a reprieve to Bankman-Fried. Polymarket participants have largely dismissed the likelihood of such a move, with the odds lingering around a meager 5% to 10%. Source: Polymath Bankman-Fried’s journey from crypto wunderkind to a convicted fraudster is one of the most dramatic downfalls in recent financial history. At the height of his career, SBF was seen as a leading force in the crypto industry, lauded for founding FTX in 2019 and rapidly transforming it into one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges. His influence extended beyond digital finance. He carefully constructed a public persona that merged tech innovation with social responsibility. By 2020, Bankman-Fried had become one of the most recognizable names in crypto and politics, building a reputation as a key donor and lobbyist. At this point, Bankman-Fried’s entanglement with US politics becomes undeniable. In the 2020 presidential race, he emerged as one of the largest contributors to Biden’s campaign, donating a substantial $5.2 million . This generous backing bolstered his reputation as a crypto prodigy and a formidable political player. While Bankman-Fried maintained a bipartisan approach to donations , records indicate that approximately 92% of his political contributions were directed toward Democrats. However, the collapse of FTX in late 2022 shattered Bankman-Fried’s public image, dragging him into a vortex of legal battles and public condemnation. Bankman-Fried was accused of orchestrating one of the most significant financial frauds in recent history. His downfall has cast a long shadow over the Democratic Party, prompting some Republican figures to call for greater transparency regarding the fate of his campaign donations. Despite this pressure, the Biden administration has yet to address returning or reallocating the contributions formally. Will President Biden Pardon The Biggest Fraudster In Crypto History? In December 2022, FTX filed for bankruptcy , exposing an $8 billion hole in customer accounts. Investigations revealed that SBF had funneled client funds into Alameda Research to cover its losses, effectively using depositor money to bankroll risky ventures. By October 2023, Bankman-Fried was convicted of fraud and conspiracy charges. His sentencing in March 2024 dealt him 25 years in federal prison . Despite his conviction and imprisonment, Bankman-Fried’s political connections bring hope to him. Presidential pardons have historically been a topic of public debate, especially when they apply to individuals with close ties to political elites. The prospect of Biden issuing such a pardon, whether now or during his final days in office, remains contentious, especially as the 2025 Trump inauguration gets closer. Polymarket’s 5% odds may seem low, but things can change quickly. For now, SBF’s fate still leaves him in prison.

The $143 million worth of ETH was transferred to HTX crypto exchange. Since November 10th, Sun has offloaded 108,919 ETH. Justin Sun, the founder of the Tron blockchain, has moved his Ether (ETH) holdings from various platforms to crypto exchange HTX (formerly Huobi). Sun serves as an advisor to the exchange.

38001139,https://crypto.news/?p=14321569,1734950279,Here’s why HYPE fell 20% over the past day,"Hyperliquid’s native token, HYPE, which had been on an upward trend over the past few days, experienced a 20% price dip today, trading at $26.54, while its market cap dropped below $9 billion. Hyperliquid ( HYPE ) surged to a record high of $34.96 on Dec. 22, rising from its airdrop listing price of $11 and achieving nearly 200% cumulative gains. Its market cap surpassed $11.5 billion at the time, securing a spot among the top 20 coins by market cap, according to CoinGecko. Launched in June 2023, Hyperliquid DEX has gained traction due to its innovative approach to eliminating gas fees for transactions. The platform offers low fees on perpetual contracts and trade openings, with the revenue reinvested into the ecosystem through token buybacks or by supporting ecosystem vaults. HYPE’s price rallied after one of the most highly anticipated token airdrops of the year. Hyperliquid distributed 310 million tokens to its users, marking the largest airdrop in crypto history. However, the altcoin’s price has faced a setback due to growing concerns within its community, making HYPE the top trending coin on CoinGecko. HYPE dropped by 26% from its all-time high reached yesterday, hitting an intraday low of $25.77 on De. 23. The slump brought its market cap down to $8.87 billion, making it the 23rd largest crypto asset at press time. You might also like: Happy Cat, Hyperliquid, Virtuals lead as Bitcoin steadies above $100k Why did HYPE tank? HYPE’s price dropped after community members noticed that a major whale, identified as X user laurentzeimes, began selling over 1 million HYPE tokens. The sales were executed using Hyperliquid DEX’s TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price) mechanism, which splits large orders into smaller transactions over a set period to minimize slippage. So far, within the ongoing TWAP execution, the whale has sold 175,000 tokens. The whale sell-off coincided with concerns over North Korean hackers actively trading on the platform, with cybersecurity expert Tayvano speculating in an X post that this activity might be an attempt to test a vulnerability in Hyperliquid’s security. The expert noted that the issue is especially alarming given that Hyperliquid operates with only four validators, raising further concerns. Following the discovery, Hyperliquid has experienced over $42 million in USDC outflows — its largest since launch — likely exacerbating HYPE’s price plunge per data from Dune Analytics. However, analysts remain optimistic despite the recent hiccups, predicting that HYPE could resume its climb and potentially reach a new all-time high. In a Dec. 23 post , analyst CJ, with 92.8k followers, expressed a bullish outlook for HYPE, suggesting it could climb towards a $40 target if it breaks above the key $30–$32 resistance level. He noted that while the short-term trend may appear bearish, a drop to $18–$22 could offer traders a strong buying opportunity. However, CJ added that if HYPE’s price rebounds to around $32.3 in the coming days, it would invalidate his prediction. Previously, crypto.news analysts predicted a similar price target, stating that HYPE needs to rise above its all-time high of $34.8 to confirm a bullish breakout, potentially reaching $40. This outlook is supported by Hyperliquid’s strong performance in the DeFi sector, where it leads the decentralized perpetual trading market with a weekly trading volume that peaked at $98.6 billion last week and a TVL that recently surpassed $3.4 billion for the first time this month, up from $188 million in October.

ADA saw a significant 15% drop in value over the past seven days. However, recent price movements suggest a potential bullish reversal despite this decline. ADA has rebounded after testing a major support level around $0.80 , reigniting optimism among analysts. Popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared his views on ADA’s future trajectory following this week’s pullback, noting the current market scenario reflects the 2020 bull cycle. “ADA is following an eerily similar pattern to its previous cycle. Back in 2020, the first major correction after the bull rally began happened at the very same time as the correction we are experiencing today.” He tweeted Sunday, predicting the price could surge to “$6 next”. Notably, in January, the pundit pointed out the same pattern, noting that if history repeats itself, ADA could surge to $7. Elsewhere analyst “Liqprodigy” highlighted the recent appearance of a potential double bottom pattern on ADA’s weekly chart, which often signals a shift from a downtrend to an uptrend. “ ADA 1week chart has broken out from double bottom pattern & is now retesting the green horizontal line. Once we get a bounce back from the horizontal line, we can see huge pumps,” he tweeted, pointing to a target of $3 if it successfully rebounds from this key level. Notably, Michaël van de Poppe, an analyst with over 750,000 followers on X, also sees ADA’s price potentially stabilizing around $0.75, calling it the “ most optimal entry level for ADA if the markets are experiencing a broader correction.” In a recent post, van de Poppe shared his expectation for ADA to reach a new all-time high next year. Key technical indicators, including the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) and Relative Strength Index (RSI) crossing above the 50 level, also show bullish signals, further fueling optimism. Additionally, whale activity plays a key role in ADA’s market movements. Over the past month, ADA whales have accumulated hundreds of millions of tokens, as highlighted by analyst Ali Martinez in several posts on X. Similarly, analyst “Givesfux” observed a surge in whale transactions this week, noting on Tuesday, “Despite the pullback, whales are on the move—687 transactions over $1M in the last 24 hours. Historically, whale activity = bullish sentiment.” This suggests that large investors remain confident in Cardano’s long-term potential, which could support future price growth.

Here Are the Details","Bitcoin (BTC) could face further downward pressure in the coming weeks, presenting a potential “dip buying” opportunity for long-term investors, according to Andre Dragosch, European Director and Head of Research at Bitwise Asset Management. Bitcoin Faces More Turbulence After Biggest Weekly Drop Since August, Experts Warn Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value, fell 8.8% last week to around $95,000, marking its steepest decline since August, amid hawkish signals from the Federal Reserve. The Fed’s statement, which included fewer rate cuts planned for 2025 and a reaffirmation of the ban on BTC holdings, contributed to a broad risk-off sentiment in the markets. Traditional financial assets were also affected, with the S&P 500 losing 2% while the dollar index rose 0.8% to its highest level since October 2022. Treasury yields rose sharply, with the 10-year note gaining 14 basis points, signaling higher borrowing costs and increasing the appeal of fixed-income investments over riskier assets such as cryptocurrencies. Dragosch, who is known for correctly predicting that BTC would rise above $100,000 in the summer, has become cautious, citing tightening financial conditions and a resurgence of inflationary pressures. “While further pain is likely in the short term, given Bitcoin’s supply shortages and ongoing structural tailwinds, this could represent an intriguing buying opportunity.” Despite the short-term negativity, Dragosch remains optimistic about Bitcoin's long-term prospects. BTC’s fixed supply cap and growing adoption as a store of value could position it as a strong hedge against monetary instability. *This is not investment advice.

38001106,https://crypto.news/?p=14321561,1734950127,El Salvador celebrates Christmas 2024 by buying another Bitcoin,"El Salvador’s festive holiday celebrations amid IMF restrictions. As the country adds to its Bitcoin ( BTC ) reserve, El Salvador’s Christmas 2024 celebration has a distinctive Bitcoin-themed Christmas tree, further demonstrating the country’s everlasting dedication to the original cryptocurrency. https://twitter.com/WatcherGuru/status/1871032479596810282 On Dec. 19, 2024, shortly after obtaining a $1.4 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund , El Salvador made headlines once more when it bought 11 BTC, valued at over $1 million. This action demonstrates the nation’s audacious BTC strategy despite outside criticism. The criticism primarily comes from traditional financial institutions and economists , who have expressed concerns about the risks of BTC’s volatility and its impact on the country’s financial stability. El Salvador became the first nation to accept BTC as legal tender in September 2021, making history in the process. Although contentious, this ruling signaled a shift in the nation’s stance on cryptocurrencies. BTC has been a major part of the nation’s financial scene in recent years. Cryptocurrency has become a part of daily life, from government-backed BTC ATMs to its growing use in enterprises. However, this approach has faced skepticism, particularly from global financial entities like the IMF, which has imposed conditions on the country’s financial strategy. The terms of the recent $1.4 billion IMF loan, which was signed on Dec. 18, 2024, affect the nation’s cryptocurrency policy, one of which is to impose a ban on cryptocurrency transactions. Furthermore, companies are no longer obligated to take cryptocurrencies, and taxes may only be handled in US dollars. In addition, the IMF has ordered El Salvador’s government to stop using the Chivo wallet , a state-backed cryptocurrency wallet that was first made available in 2021. This wallet was a component of El Salvador’s larger initiative to incorporate BTC into the country’s financial system, enabling companies and residents to use cryptocurrencies to access government services and perform transactions. You might also like: El Salvador to discontinue Bitcoin wallet Chivo in $1.4b IMF deal IMF loans frequently have terms that have a direct impact on a country’s financial and economic choices. The purpose of these requirements is to guarantee financial restraint and conformity to global financial norms. Certain independent financial practices, like the usage of cryptocurrencies, may have to be abandoned or restricted by the loan arrangement. Because of the IMF’s pressure on nations to adopt more conventional monetary practices—like depending on central banks and national currencies—instead of decentralized digital currencies, these loan terms usually lead to a loss of financial sovereignty. But it seems like El Salvador is not going to back down. The government is still giving priority to cryptocurrencies despite the IMF’s restrictions. The nation’s National Bitcoin Office, established in 2021 as a key part of the country’s BTC strategy, reaffirmed its commitment to its long-term BTC plan and stated that no BTC from its reserves will be sold. https://twitter.com/bitcoinofficesv/status/1869899405391999015 El Salvador now has 5,995 BTC in its possession, which is worth around $569.5 million at the time of writing. Their overall reserves are now close to 6,000 BTC after the most recent acquisition of 11 BTC. Approximately $97,000 is the average purchasing price per BTC in the nation. The nation’s dedication to BTC as a long-term investment is demonstrated by recent statistics from its portfolio: Total BTC Holdings: Over $572 million, or around 5,995 BTC. Impact of BTC Price: Due to volatility, the portfolio recently had a $6.08 million decline, which is equivalent to a small decline of $1.02K per BTC. Source: Arkham The balance history graph shows a general upward trend in the value of the reserves, demonstrating steady long-term growth despite transient fluctuations. Notably, 2024 saw a notable increase that began in the middle of the year and continued to rise consistently until December to correspond with the new IMF agreement and the nation’s ongoing BTC purchases. Even in the face of worldwide criticism, El Salvador shows a clear and calculated strategy for maintaining its cryptocurrency holdings by utilizing such strong financial tracking systems. El Salvador has demonstrated its support for the cryptocurrency sector by recognizing its potential to promote financial independence and lessen dependency on global financial institutions.

38000990,https://finbold.com/?p=221932,1734949971,Robert Kiyosaki warns ‘Global crash has started’,"Up to this point, 2024 has been rather kind in terms of returns — not to mention the start of the cryptocurrency bull run and the S&P 500 at all-time highs (ATHs), but it is simply the nature of the markets to wax and wane. No uptrend or downtrend lasts forever — and being able to correctly identify that shift is a skill that can net immense profit — or prevent huge losses. It comes as little surprise that investors tend to turn to the experts when it comes to this topic. Although most market analysts are optimistic, one of the most notable dissenting voices is Robert Kiyosaki — author of the bestselling personal finance book ‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’. A noted cryptocurrency and precious metal bull , Kiyosaki has had a slight tone of change recently — now, he expects to see a market-wide crash on a global scale. Robert Kiyosaki turns bearish — but still optimistic on gold and BTC Reflecting on recent events, Kiyosaki claimed that the crash had already started — citing Europe, China, and the United States as regions facing downturns in a December 23 post made on social media platform X. Global crash has started. Europe, China. USA going down . Depression ahead? Please be smarter with your money. Hang on to your job and your money. Biggest problem are our leaders and educators. As I have often asked “What did school teach you about money?” Regardless of… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) December 23, 2024 He urged investors to be smart with their money and keep their jobs — adding that crashes are the best time to get richer for many people. While the author and investor did not reflect on the causes of the crash, in a more far-reaching manner, he pinned the blame on educators — asking ‘What did school teach you about money?’ However, this was Kiyosaki’s most bold and notable prediction: ‘Regardless of which way the economy goes, gold, silver, and Bitcoin hold their value’. While gold and silver are proven hedges, BTC has shown an increasing correlation with the performance of traditional assets as the years go by — and there are more than enough crashes in recent memory to dispute Kiyosaki’s thesis that Bitcoin holds its value no matter what. BTC price historical chart. Source: Finbold What’s more, a crash could easily lead to large-scale BTC liquidation — with investors locking in profits and subsequently redirecting them to now-cheap equities. Is Kiyosaki right about an upcoming crash? Finally, it should be noted that the old analogy of a broken clock being right twice a day very much applies in this instance. Kiyosaki has often been accused of leveraging scaremongering tactics — he has a long history of ‘calling’ market crashes that simply fail to materialize. The S&P 500 price chart with Rober Kiyosaki’s crash predictions up to 2021. Source: @fintwit_news. Predicting market tops and subsequent reversals is such a tall order that no one has been able to do it reliably and on a consistent basis. Even the investors who have the best track record in terms of predictions tend to overshoot — or as a common joke goes, they’ve predicted 20 out of the last 4 crashes. That’s not to say that there isn’t value in Kiyosaki’s line of reasoning — allocating a certain portion of holdings to defensive stocks, hedges like gold and silver, and even diversifying into digital assets like Bitcoin can serve to reduce risk — provided that it is done sensibly.

38000784,https://finbold.com/?p=221905,1734949573,"Another Dogecoin (DOGE) ‘parabolic rally is on the way,’ says expert","As Dogecoin ( DOGE ) struggles with short-term bearish sentiments, historical price movements and technical indicators suggest the top meme coin might be poised for another parabolic rally. This outlook comes from renowned cryptocurrency trading expert Ali Martinez, who drew parallels between Dogecoin’s 2017 and 2021 movements, hinting at explosive growth after significant retracements, as shared in an X post on December 23. Back in 2017, Dogecoin surged 212%, followed by a 40% retracement, before embarking on a 5,000% rally. Similarly, in 2021, DOGE climbed 476%, retraced by 56%, and soared by 12,000% to reach its all-time high. Dogecoin price analysis chart. Source: TradigView/Ali_charts The same pattern appears to be replicating in 2024, with the meme coin surging 440% before undergoing a 46% retracement, closely mirroring its previous cycles. According to Martinez’s analysis, this setup could signal the beginning of another parabolic move for Dogecoin. “Now, in 2024, DOGE is up 440% and has retraced by 46%. If history repeats, another parabolic rally is on the way,” Martinez said. Indeed, Dogecoin’s price has been confined within an ascending channel, a pattern often preceding major rallies. A breakout above the channel could signal a bullish reversal and trigger a parabolic rally. DOGE’s $0.70 price target In another X post on December 21, cryptocurrency trading analyst Javon Marks also highlighted that historical patterns could hint at another DOGE rally. The analyst noted the recent pullback mirrors price movements from 2020, when DOGE broke through descending resistance patterns, consolidated briefly, and surged over 122%, achieving more than double gains. Dogecoin price analysis chart. Source: TradigView The anticipated target for this rally is $0.73905, suggesting Dogecoin could revisit and surpass its all-time high. Besides the technical setup, Dogecoin’s potential to rally is also guided by fundamental factors, with Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) CEO Elon Musk’s influence remaining a key element. Musk’s commentary on Dogecoin has been influential, and the possibility of a rally could coincide with his official appointment as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in January 2025. Additionally, DOGE has recently seen an increase in whale accumulation , reinforcing confidence in the asset. Historically, such transactions have preceded major price rallies. DOGE price analysis At press time, DOGE was valued at $0.31, showing weakness on the daily and weekly timeframes, dropping 0.40% and 21%, respectively. DOGE seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Amid the current correction, Dogecoin’s technical setup suggests a possible downside in the short term. The coin is trading below its 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) of $0.360157, reinforcing bearish momentum. DOGE remains above its 200-day SMA, which is at $0.178915, indicating that the long-term trend may still hold bullish undertones. Interestingly, the Fear & Greed Index reflects a reading of 73, firmly in the “Greed” zone, hinting at strong market interest despite prevailing negative sentiment. In summary, as DOGE faces short-term weakness, historical patterns suggest Dogecoin could be on the verge of another explosive rally, eyeing a breakout toward the $1 mark.

38001796,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/bitcoin-btc-price-trends-downward-will-the-decline-persist,1734949446,Bitcoin ($BTC) Price Trends Downward: Will the Decline Persist?,"Over the last five days the Bitcoin ($BTC) price has generally trended downward. Currently holding just above $95,000, will this decline continue, or could we see a big recovery going into the end of this year? A perfectly normal $BTC trajectory The king of cryptocurrencies has been very much in sideways and downward mode over the last few days. In fact, the drop in price that took place over last Thursday and Friday took $BTC down to a price of $92,700, which was first seen more than a month ago. Since that time, $BTC has followed an upward tilting channel, dropping out of it during the aforementioned price dip. Given that ascending channels generally do break to the downside, Bitcoin’s trajectory over these last few weeks has been perfectly normal. Now that a bearish weekend is behind us, and the short term momentum indicators have reset, it could be that some green candles start to reverse this last downward trend. Will MicroStrategy announce another purchase on Monday? One factor that could accelerate Monday’s positive start is the possibility that MicroStrategy could announce its next BTC purchase. According to Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy Portfolio Tracker , the green dots that record all purchases have appeared every Monday since 11 November. It would therefore be no surprise to hear of a new purchase later today. Can $BTC reenter the ascending channel? Source: TradingView The 4-hour chart shows the $BTC trajectory over recent weeks. Given that Monday has dawned brightly for $BTC, with the price up 0.80% so far, it may be that the measured move out of the channel does not take place - at least not yet. It can also be seen that the ascending trendline, that goes all the way back to the 2021 bull market double top, is being respected. It has acted as strong support so far, and this may well continue. If this last correctional phase is indeed over, the next targets for $BTC are $98,000, $100,000, and $102,000, which besides being good support/resistance levels, are also Fibonacci levels. This would take $BTC back inside the ascending channel. If the top of this channel can be attained once again, a new all-time high would be the prize. $BTC cup and handle pattern predicts $120,000 Source: TradingView Much information can be gleaned from the above 2-week chart. First of all, the ascending trendline that bisects the double top of the 2021 bull market can be clearly seen. The support that this line is giving to the current price can also be noted. Looking at the entirety of the descent into the bear market from that last top in 2021, and the consequent ascent into the current bull market, shows that a cup and handle chart pattern developed, with the handle being formed by the long 8-month bull flag. The price sprang upwards from that $69,000 base and is still potentially on the way to its measured move of $120,000. RSI could signal the next bear market The bottom of the chart contains the Relative Strength Indicator (RSI), which signals oversold or overbought conditions. This indicator has rolled over due to the recent corrective impulse, and this is currently signalling a lower low compared to the previous two tops that can be seen on the chart. However, there is a good chance that the 70.00 level could act as support. If the indicator line is showing below this level at the weekly close, then this dip is likely to continue. Looking much further out, if this indicator line does not get above the previous high of 87.00, very serious bearish divergence would come into play - probably putting an end to this bull market, and signalling the start of the next bear market.

38000803,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=632167,1734949433,Is Litecoin (LTC) merge mining the new trend for tokens?,"Litecoin (LTC) merge mining is turning into a tool for both security and exposure for new tokens. A small new family of assets is emerging, aiming to repeat the success of Dogecoin (DOGE). Litecoin (LTC) merge mining is turning into both a security and a marketing tool for new tokens. A small batch of new assets are trying to ride on the fame of LTC and DOGE, while also gaining exposure from major mining pools. Binance Pool has announced the addition of three new assets to its merged mining program – LKY, PEP, and LKC. Merge mining is the process of producing other coins and tokens in each block of a minable coin. The new production does not make mining more expensive, but creates a secure new asset at virtually no extra cost. Every Litecoin block has produced DOGE for years, while ensuring cheap transactions on the Litecoin chain. In 2024, the network added BELLS, Luckycoin (LKY), Pepecoin (PEP), and Junkcoin (JKC). Additional merged mining arrives at a time when the Litecoin hashrate marked new all-time highs. LTC mining was close to 1.8 PH/s, remaining a staple for some of the large pools. The Litecoin network retained its popularity, adding some stability to the LTC market price . After the latest market drawdown, LTC traded at $103.22, recovering some of its lost ground. DOGE traded at $0.31 during the latest market drawdown. BELLS retained a level of $0.61. JKC traded around $0.22, while PEP retained the $0.0012 level. All the merged mining coins backtracked during the latest market correction. However, those assets also benefitted from the meme token frenzy. Litecoin remains the fourth largest mined coin, which has retained its influence in the crypto space. Mining has expanded in 2024, as most corporate pools reinvested in the newest ASIC, increasing the capacity for competition and growing each network’s security. Litecoin mining followed the trend of Bitcoin with constant expansion to new all-time highs as new machines come online. Binance Pool expands access to merged mining The availability of merged mining coins depends on the decision of every respective pool. Binance Pool has added payouts, though sometimes requiring the end user to provide a suitable wallet. The Binance Pool has warned that JKC, PEP, BELLS, and LKY remain unlisted, and the addition of mining opportunities does not translate into future listings. Additionally, the reward schedule for all assets are independent of the LTC earned in a block. Binance Pool solves around 10% of all Litecoin blocks. The Binance Pool started adding new merge mining assets since September, with BELLS becoming the first expansion. The trend of adding new rewards has spread to most major Litecoin mining pools. ViaBTC and F2Pool offer LKY and PEP, but have not yet added JKC. Other pools still limit their merged mining to DOGE and BELLS. Currently, Binance has announced the widest selection of merged mining assets. Scrypt mining also retains popularity, with a total of 21 minable assets. Those coins are not available for merged mining, and require different settings. The current profitability of Litecoin mining with 1 GH/s mining power is around $30 per day, based on LTC and DOGE rewards alone. Modern mining ASIC offer more than 9 GH/s, though some rely on competitive pricing. Merged mining offers a boost to lowered block rewards Merged mining may prove a valuable bonus depending on the hashrate. As large pools and miners continue to pay attention to the Litecoin network, some of those entities may have large reserves of all merged mining coins. Merged mining has also existed for Bitcoin, producing Elastos (ELA) tokens, as well as NMC, Syscoin (SYS), and FB, with different rules and proportions. Merged mining can offset some of the lowered block rewards. Litecoin’s network also remains attractive for its $0.0048 fees for regular transactions. The chain has a highly active turnover, reaching more than 78% of the LTC supply, as the asset is used to move funds between wallets. The other advantage of Litecoin is its wide reach with legacy services, dating back to the first wave of crypto expansion. LTC now awaits an eventual ETF launch, while still being used for trading, payments, and general transfers.

Trump's pro-Bitcoin stance appears more like electioneering than a well-thought-out policy, conflicting with his pledge to maintain the USD reserve currency status. Establishing a Bitcoin reserve would face significant funding challenges and skepticism from mainstream financial institutions and Congress. Despite occasional bullishness, I remain cautious about Bitcoin's hype and wary of being bullish due to the speculative nature of the reserve idea. The idea of the US establishing a strategic national reserve of Bitcoin has recently attracted a lot of media attention. In this article, I will discuss my views on how this might impact Bitcoin's price. Before I begin the discussion, for readers that have not read my commentary on crypto before, I would like to showcase my crypto ""credentials"" with the tactical buy recommendation of Coinbase ( COIN ) in Oct 2022 during the previous crypto winter, which has since gone up by 315%. Author track record on crypto (Seeking Alpha) Now back to the discussion on the Bitcoin National Reserve. Timeline and overview Bitcoin price (StockCharts) The idea of establishing a Bitcoin National Reserve in the US is a relatively recent one. If you google for ""Bitcoin reserve"" before July 1, 2024, you won't find many mainstream mentions of the idea. President-elect Donald Trump first mentioned creating a ""national bitcoin stockpile"" on July 27, 2024 at a bitcoin conference, reportedly saying ""If I am elected, it will be the policy of my administration, the United States of America, to keep 100% of all the bitcoin the U.S. government currently holds or acquires into the future…If we don't embrace crypto and bitcoin technology, China will, other countries will. They'll dominate, and we cannot let China dominate. They are making too much progress as it is."" As shown in the above chart, this mention coincided with the trough in bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices in July 2024, which have soared since Donald Trump won the US Presidential election in November 2024. The Bitcoin Act of 2024 was also introduced on July 31, 2024 by Senator Cynthia Lummis, which proposed to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve through the Treasury purchasing 1 million Bitcoins over a 5-year period and held for 20 years (unless used to retire the outstanding federal debt). Since Donald Trump won the election, momentum (or at least discussion) for establishing a Bitcoin National Reserve has snowballed: Trump has nominated David Sacks as AI and crypto czar, who is viewed as friendly towards the crypto industry. Trump has made multiple comments on crypto that were viewed positively ( example ) My Assessment of likelihood My current assessment is, despite the hype, it is unlikely the Bitcoin National Reserve will be established in any meaningful way: There may be some symbolic gesture where the Bitcoin owned by the US federal government ( currently about 200k ) is placed in a reserve; however, the federal government purchasing massive amounts of Bitcoin is probably unlikely. Based on a summary of pros and cons from the broader financial community, I personally don't find the arguments in favor of establishing a Bitcoin reserve as persuasive: Reasons supporting Bitcoin reserve My view 1. Inflation hedges against economic uncertainty and monetary instability While buying Bitcoin as an inflation hedge may make sense from an individual investor's point of view, it does not make sense from a legislative point of view. Inflation over the long run is largely due to money printing and government overspending, without addressing these root causes, proposing that the government buys bitcoin just because the government cannot balance its books doesn't sound like a strong argument to me. It's like, if a car broke down, proposing to rent a car instead of fixing it. 2. strengthen the dollar as the world's reserve currency It's not clear to me why promoting an alternative currency strengthens the dollar as the world's reserve currency. It could just as well encourage other countries to use Bitcoin and forgo the dollar. 3.exert control over bitcoin supply I'm not sure what would be achieved by the government owning 5% or 10% or 15% of all Bitcoin supply. Does having 19 million Bitcoin in circulation rather than 21 million Bitcoin in circulation somehow improve Bitcoin? By the same logic, the Federal Reserve might buy stocks just to exert control of the supply of stocks, but the stock market is doing just fine doing its own thing without such additional governmental support. Reasons against Bitcoin reserve 1. not crucial to running the economy (unlike oil reserves) This I would tend to agree with. While having mineral and resource stockpiles could be useful in times of economic crisis, stockpiling a bunch of digital tokens doesn't really do anything. If the concern were inflation, then the root cause should be addressed rather than funding a bitcoin reserve and avoiding root problems. 2.commit the state and taxpayers to backing bitcoin and create economic risks This I find some merits as well. While I can appreciate the uses of Bitcoin, does that mean the government should commit to backing it when there are so many other items on the agenda? And if the wider public has that question in mind, it may be difficult to pass actual legislation funding any Bitcoin reserve. Donald Trump's pronouncements on Bitcoin appear, in my opinion, to be telling crypto proponents what they want to hear rather than a well-thought-out policy: His initial pledge to establish a Bitcoin Strategic Stockpile in July 2024 was made at a Bitcoin conference, so it may just be electioneering and fundraising and telling the crypto crowd what they want to hear. Trump has previously made many negative comments on Bitcoin before embracing it in July 2024, e.g. in 2021 he called Bitcoin ""a scam against the US Dollar"". There is very little indication of what caused this change of heart. While Donald Trump has been very public and consistent about some of his policy ideas since the 1980s (e.g. getting US allies to contribute more defense spending or tariffs) and attempted to apply them during his first term as president, his change in stance on Bitcoin is relatively new and untested. This could mean even if he views Bitcoin more positively (for whatever reason), he might not push too hard for it and just make a moderate effort to placate his supporters, which might not be enough to get the Bitcoin reserve established. It contradicts with his pledge to maintain the US Dollar reserve currency status. Trump has mentioned potential massive tariffs against countries that go against the US Dollar reserve currency status. It would make no sense to expend that much effort to maintain the USD reserve currency status just to undermine it by elevating Bitcoin. Some of his points don't correspond to what is happening in reality: Trump often mentions that the US should counter China's influence in crypto while China has actually banned crypto activities in its mainland territories (allowing crypto to be conducted only in Hong Kong etc), so this type of ""straw man"" argument does not hold up under close scrutiny. Massive funding for something so unorthodox (purchasing 1 million Bitcoin at $100,000/each would cost $100 billion) would be relatively hard to pass in Congress. Witness in the below chart how during the Great Financial Crisis of 2008 how it took a stock market collapsing for a year before Congress would pass legislation establishing TARP. Given how we've seen in the past week the difficulty of getting run-of-the-mill stopgap spending bills through Congress, spending a hundred billion dollars purchasing Bitcoin sounds farfetched.

With innovation, hype, and seismic shifts in technology, the crypto space has emerged as a tantalising alternative to traditional investments. Whether you’re a die-hard Bitcoin enthusiast, a Polkadot aficionado, or someone who’s just heard whispers about the rising star Qubetics presale , one thing is clear: these projects are no longer niche. They’re the talk of the town—and for good reason. While Bitcoin and Polkadot have held the limelight for years, Qubetics ($TICS) is turning heads with its impressive milestones and bold vision. Analysts are already buzzing about its potential to disrupt markets in 2025 and beyond. So, which crypto is worth your hard-earned cash? Let’s dive into why these are the Best Coins to Join for 2025 and how they’re reshaping the investment landscape. Qubetics: Real World Asset Tokenisation and a Bold Vision for 2025 Here’s the lowdown on Qubetics: It’s not just another crypto. Qubetics is making waves with its presale success and its unique focus on Real World Asset Tokenisation (RWAT). With over 367 million $TICS tokens already sold to 11,300 holders, raising more than $7.5 million, this project is commanding attention from crypto investors hungry for the next big thing. Imagine owning a fraction of a luxury yacht, a prime piece of real estate in Manhattan, or even a rare piece of art—all without needing deep pockets or a trust fund. That’s the power of Real World Asset Tokenisation, and Qubetics is leading the charge. By turning physical assets into blockchain-based tokens, Qubetics democratises access to previously exclusive investments. Take this: a real estate developer wants to raise funds for a high-rise project. Instead of waiting for one or two big investors, they tokenize the building’s value. Individuals can then buy $TICS tokens to own a slice of that project. It’s like crowdfunding meets Wall Street but with way fewer middlemen. For businesses, this means quicker capital access. For professionals and individuals, it opens up a world of opportunities. No more being locked out of high-end investments because you’re not a millionaire. And thanks to blockchain , everything’s transparent, secure, and free of the usual headaches like excessive paperwork or delays. At $0.0342 per $TICS token during the 13th stage, the Qubetics presale is an enticing entry point. And here’s where things get wild: analysts are predicting the price to soar to $10-$15 after the mainnet launch. Let’s do some quick math. A $5,000 investment in $TICS at today’s price gets you about 146,198 tokens. At $1, you’re sitting on $146,198. At $15? You’re looking at over $2.1 million. Crazy, right? Even before the mainnet, $TICS is forecasted to hit $0.25, a 630% ROI. And that’s just the start. With analysts projecting a potential 43,711% ROI at $15 post-launch, Qubetics has investors—and sceptics—buzzing. The best part? You can still get in before the next price hike this weekend. Qubetics isn’t just a tech-savvy buzzword. It’s a community-driven project, and its current presale numbers prove that people believe in its vision. The blend of cutting-edge tokenisation tech with real-world use cases is making $TICS a hot pick among crypto enthusiasts. Add its solid presale tally, rising token price, and community support, and you’ve got one of the Best Coins to Join for 2025 . Bitcoin: The OG King of Crypto Ah, Bitcoin. Love it or hate it, there’s no denying its dominance. Launched in 2009, Bitcoin started the whole cryptocurrency revolution. For over a decade, it’s been the go-to asset for investors who want an alternative to fiat currency and gold. With a capped supply of 21 million coins, Bitcoin thrives on scarcity. Its decentralised nature and robust security make it the ultimate digital store of value. If gold is the “boomer” investment, Bitcoin is the cool millennial cousin who’s already a millionaire. Bitcoin’s appeal is simple: it’s decentralised, untouchable by governments, and has massive mainstream adoption. From Tesla accepting Bitcoin (at least for a while) to El Salvador making it legal tender, this crypto OG continues to stay relevant. If you’re looking for a safe bet in the wild world of crypto, Bitcoin is a no-brainer. But with its high price tag, newcomers might find it less appealing than rising stars like Qubetics. Polkadot: Connecting the Dots of Blockchain Polkadot isn’t just a cute name. It’s a powerhouse blockchain that solves a huge problem: interoperability. In simple terms, Polkadot allows different blockchains to talk to each other. Launched in 2020, it’s already a fan favourite for developers and investors alike. Think of blockchains like islands. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana—they’re all doing their thing, but they don’t exactly communicate. Polkadot builds bridges between these islands, enabling seamless data and asset transfers across chains. This opens up endless possibilities for decentralised apps (dApps) and cross-chain projects. Its native token, DOT, plays a crucial role in governance, staking, and bonding. In plain English, owning DOT lets you influence Polkadot’s future while earning rewards through staking. Polkadot’s ecosystem is thriving, with parachains (custom blockchains) being added at a rapid pace. Developers love its flexibility, and investors are drawn to its innovative approach. If Bitcoin is digital gold and Qubetics is the tokenisation pioneer, Polkadot is the blockchain whisperer, uniting fragmented networks. Conclusion: Why Qubetics, Bitcoin, and Polkadot Are the Best Coins to Join for 2025 So, what’s the takeaway here? If you’re scouting for the Best Coins to Join for 2025 , all three projects—Qubetics, Bitcoin, and Polkadot—deserve your attention. Bitcoin offers stability and legacy status. Polkadot is the tech-savvy connector solving real blockchain problems. But Qubetics? It’s the dark horse poised for explosive growth, thanks to its Real World Asset Tokenisation and record-breaking presale. Want to make 2025 your breakout year? Don’t wait on the sidelines. With $TICS tokens priced at $0.0342 and a price hike looming, now’s your chance to jump in. The Qubetics presale is your golden ticket to a potential financial windfall. Let’s be real: opportunities like this don’t come around every day. Ready to join the revolution? Head over to the Qubetics presale and grab your $TICS tokens today!

In a new “Crypto Market Outlook” report, Coinbase starts its list with stablecoins, saying that they’re “just getting started” after the sector’s explosive growth in 2024. Coinbase says stablecoins are crypto’s “killer app” and their use case will soon expand beyond simple trading. “As stablecoins continue their surge, we are rapidly approaching the day when their first and primary use cases will be global capital flows and commerce, rather than trading.” Next on the list is the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs), which Coinbase says will emerge as a cornerstone of the current crypto market cycle in 2025. “Firms are experimenting with using tokenized assets as collateral for other financial transactions, like those involving derivatives, which could streamline operations and mitigate risk. Moreover, the RWA trend is expanding beyond assets like US Treasuries and money market funds – finding traction with private credit, commodities, corporate bonds, real estate, and insurance as well.” The third area to watch, according to Coinbase, is the exchange-traded fund (ETF) space. Coinbase says it expects institutional interest to remain concentrated within a select few crypto ETFs. The crypto exchange is also interested in potential rule changes that regulators could make, like allowing ETF products to incorporate staking or in-kind redemptions. Next up is decentralized finance (DeFi). Coinbase says DeFi will witness a “resurgence” that will propel it into a new era and extend its reach. “Decentralized finance (DeFi) took some hits in the previous cycle, but a more sustainable and resilient ecosystem has emerged. Lending protocols are hitting all-time highs in total value locked (TVL), while decentralized exchanges (DEXs) are pushing their share of trading volumes – relative to centralized exchanges (CEXs) – to unprecedented levels.” The fifth area in crypto markets Coinbase says to watch is the regulatory climate, which the exchange says is due for a major shift that boosts the industry. Coinbase says that a pro-crypto majority in both the House and Senate will be a tailwind for crypto in 2025. “Specifically, we expect to see the establishment of a comprehensive regulatory framework in the US, the introduction of sound stablecoin legislation, and an end to the era of regulation by enforcement. And the US isn’t the only jurisdiction poised to make regulatory progress. Many G20 countries and major financial hubs are writing rules to accommodate digital assets, which should help create more conducive environments for innovation and growth. Taken together, these moves can open the door for more people and institutions to confidently participate in the crypto economy.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

A record $60 million of USDC fled the exchange by 10:00 UTC Monday, according to Hashed Official's Dune-based tracker. USDC, the world's second-largest dollar-pegged stablecoin, is used as collateral on HyperLiquid. The deposit bridge still holds $2.2 billion in USDC.   Addresses associated with hackers from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) have accrued losses exceeding $700,000 while trading on HyperLiquid, Tay said. The transactions indicate the hackers are potentially familiarizing themselves with the platform's inner workings to launch a malicious attack.   ""DPRK doesn't trade. DPRK tests,"" Tay said.  CoinDesk contacted HyperLiquid on X for comments on the USDC outflows and potential threat from North Korea.  Tay said they reached out to the platform two weeks ago, offering help in countering a potential threat.

38000329,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=632127,1734948532,No Dogecoin ETF yet? Experts drop hints on next moves,"The year 2024, which began with the banging launch of the US Bitcoin spot exchange rraded funds (ETFs), is ending with the hopes that more crypto-linked investment products will soon enter the market. Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas even agreed with the ETF Store’s president on the surprising absence of filings for a Dogecoin ETF. The crypto industry has registered rapid gains since the historic launch of BTC ETFs in January 2024. Bitcoin recorded a surge of over 125% on a year-to-date (YTD) basis and has knocked off the much anticipated $100K barrier. However, it is expected that the introduction of popular altcoins linked ETFs will push the cumulative crypto market cap to thrash the $4 trillion mark. Experts seek DOGE ETF soon Nate Geraci, President of the ETF Store, in a post stated that it is a shock that no ETF issuer has filed for a Dogecoin ETF yet. He asked what could be the downside and mentioned that the worst case would be its marketing expense. Meanwhile, he wonders which issuer is sitting on the ‘DOGE’ ticker. Senior ETF Analyst Balchunas agreed with Geraci and suggested that he was initially expecting them before Christmas. He now believes they might come after Paul Atkins becomes SEC chair under the Trump administration. He even speculates on potential ETF issuers: “If I’m Vegas, my favorite on the reserve of $DOGE ticker is Venuto. That said, Tuttle is my favorite to file.” Despite being the biggest meme coin in the crypto space and massive support from Elon Musk, no such investment fund manager has filed for a spot DOGE ETF with the commission. Balchunas now predicts filings after the new administration takes office. Agree. Thought by Xmas we’d see someone file. Maybe waiting til Atkins/Trump officially in charge. If I’m Vegas my favorite on reserver of $DOGE ticker is Venuto. That said Tuttle is my fav to file for the ETF. — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) December 23, 2024 With spot altcoin ETFs for Solana (SOL), Ripple’s XRP, and Litecoin (LTC) already in the works, it feels like DOGE’s turn is just a matter of time. The pro-crypto stance of incoming leadership is also a signal for a better environment around crypto ETFs. Dogecoin price action saw a minor downturn recently. DOGE is down by 21% in the last 7 days but it is still up by a huge 253% on YTD. The biggest meme crypto is trading at an average price of $0.316, at press time. It is trading down by 56% from its all time high of $0.737, recorded on May 08, 2021. Elon Musk’s D.O.G.E reforms The industry knows that Dogecoin is the favorite meme crypto of the richest person on Earth “Elon Musk.” He is now leading the charge for government reform as part of President-elect Trump’s new Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.). This move has boosted DOGE’s price eventually. Musk is aiming for a $2 trillion budget cut and sweeping agency reforms. He is proposing a return-to-office mandate for federal workers, banking on mass resignations. He even advocated for cuts to entire agencies and targeted agency leaders like FTC Chair Lina Khan for dismissal. These moves echo his X (formerly Twitter) acquisition playbook. Musk has openly criticized federal employees and agencies. He singled out Alexis Pelosi, a senior climate adviser, suggesting her dismissal and even took aim at the SEC, labeling the government as “more broken than you could possibly imagine.” From Zero to Web3 Pro: Your 90-Day Career Launch Plan",NEUTRAL,BTC | DOGE,ALTCOIN | BTC | DOGE | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/no-dogecoin-etf-yet-experts-drop-hints/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/38000329.jpeg

While bears threaten more dips, Verge token (XVG) grabbed crypto enthusiasts’ attention with notable price actions over the past day. The altcoin soared from $0.006916 to $0.001902. That translated to a remarkable 72.49% price surge. XVG’s upside trajectory reflects the significant bounce-backs in the privacy cryptocurrencies sector. These tokens displayed resilience amidst the broad market slump. According to CoinGecko data, the market capitalisation of all privacy tokens increased by 4.7% in the past day to $6,811,115,146. Moreover, the robust $453 million 24-hour trading volume signals impressive trader actions behind the assets’ performance. Source – CoinGecko Contrarily, the overall crypto sector exhibited bearishness. The global cryptocurrency market capitalisation dipped 1.40% in the previous 24 hours to $3.27 trillion. Understanding Verge Verge is a privacy-centered blockchain seeking to offer a decentralised, efficient, and fast payment platform. It enhances Bitcoin’s original blockchain by introducing privacy tools. For instance, it integrates obscurity network Tor to VergePay – its wallet -allowing individuals to send cash to anonymous wallets. Verge launched in 2014 as DogeCoinDark before rebranding to its current name in 2016 to distinguish itself from Dogecoin and promote mass adoption. Verge leverages Simple Payment Verification technology for swift transactions. With data breaches costing cryptocurrencies billions per year , privacy tokens provide users with confidential and secure options to complete transactions. They safeguard investors from possible surveillance, thus essential for individuals who prioritize privacy while in the financial world. XVG’s current price action The native token trades at $0.01266 after brief retracements from its daily peaks. Up 18% on its daily chart, XVG boasts adequate momentum for extended gains in the near term. Source – Coinmarketcap Its daily volume has surged by over 900% to surpass $160 million, confirming renewed investor optimism. Verge has seen remarkable performance in the previous sessions, with its price increasing by 85% within the last month. Further, the 240% YTD growth strengthens XVG’s status in the cryptocurrency industry. The prevailing momentum could propel the alt to $0.0149 by December end.

38000159,https://coinpedia.org/?p=396467,1734948257,Ethereum’s Dominance Struggles: Will 2025 Bring a Turnaround?,"The post Ethereum’s Dominance Struggles: Will 2025 Bring a Turnaround? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News At the start of this year, the dominance of Ethereum was around 16.96%. In late February, it touched an yearly peak of 19.28%. In mid-May, it plummeted to a low of 15.42%. Just before the launch of Ethereum spot ETFs, it rebounded to a peak of 18.8% in mid-June. However, since the launch, the ETH dominance has steadily dropped by around 5.42%. The big question now is: Can the year 2025 bring a turnaround? Bitcoin Dominance Overshadows Ethereum and Altcoins Since the start of this year, the Bitcoin market has climbed by over 115.76%. At the beginning of this year, the dominance of Bitcoin was around 51.58%. Right now, it stands at 58.71%, though between November 20 and December 7, the BTC dominance declined from a yearly peak of 61.19% to a low of 55.11%. Although between November 21 and December 6, the Ethereum dominance jumped sharply from 12.11% to 13.5%, since December 7, it has steeply slipped by at least 1.09%. Notably, the YTD growth of the Altcoin market currently stands at 65.18%, particularly Ethereum at 40.96%. This indicates that BTC has outperformed both Altcoins and Ethereum this year. Decline in Ethereum’s Dominance Despite ETF Inflows Reports indicate that Ethereum’s dominance continues to drop since the launch of Ethereum ETFs in mid-2024. Reports add that though billions of dollars flowed into the ETFs, it made very little impact on the price of Ethereum. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why is the Bitcoin (BTC) Price Dropping?

Here Are Those Altcoins,"Cryptocurrency exchange's mining platform Binance Pool has announced the launch of merged mining support for Junkcoin (JKC) and Pepecoin (PEP). Binance Pool Introduces Merged Mining for Junkcoin and Pepecoin This new feature allows miners to mine Litecoin (LTC) while also earning rewards in multiple cryptocurrencies, including LTC, Dogecoin (DOGE), Bellscoin (BELLS), Luckycoin (LKY), Junkcoin (JKC), and Pepecoin (PEP). Merged mining, also known as auxiliary proof of work (AuxPoW), allows miners to process transactions for multiple blockchains with a single computational effort. This increases efficiency and provides the opportunity to maximize earnings by mining additional coins alongside primary coins like Litecoin. By adding Junkcoin and Pepecoin to its merged mining program, Binance Pool continues to diversify its offerings by appealing to miners looking for alternative coins and higher potential rewards. The addition of JKC and PEP reflects Binance Pool’s efforts to support emerging cryptocurrencies and encourage participation in the mining ecosystem. This move is expected to support the growth of smaller blockchain networks while attracting miners looking to leverage their resources for greater profitability. Miners can join Binance Pool to take advantage of this new feature by configuring their mining setup to enable merged mining. Additional details and configuration instructions are available on the Binance Pool platform. As merged mining continues to gain traction, Binance Pool’s inclusion of Junkcoin and Pepecoin positions it as a versatile platform for both established and emerging cryptocurrencies. *This is not investment advice.

38000032,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=666335,1734948009,ADA Faces Retest Of $0.8119 As Technical Indicators Turn Bearish,"Cardano (ADA) is facing increasing bearish momentum, with its price nearing a critical support level at $0.8119. This potential retest signals a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency as market conditions turn unfavorable. Recent price action with negative signals from key technical indicators has intensified concerns about further downside risks. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and other metrics suggest growing selling pressure, making ADA’s ability to hold above this key level a matter of significance. A breach below $0.8119 could pave the way for more losses, potentially pulling ADA into uncharted bearish territory. However, defending this support level might provide the foundation for a stabilization or recovery. As the market sentiment shifts, can Cardano regain its footing or succumb to deeper declines? This critical juncture highlights the importance of monitoring technical and market-driven factors in the token’s ongoing journey. Technical Indicators Signal Further Downside For ADA Historically, the $0.8119 level has served as a crucial threshold for price action, acting as both a support and resistance point in previous market cycles. Its proximity now highlights the mounting challenges Cardano faces as bearish momentum continues to dominate the market. Related Reading: Cardano Price Eyes Recovery Toward $2 As Million-Dollar Whale Transactions Explode On The Network The negative sentiment around the token is largely fueled by weakening technical indicators and a waning market mood. ADA remains below key moving averages, such as the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), which underscores a prolonged downtrend. This alignment of the price below pivotal technical levels signals a lack of upward strength and an increased likelihood of more downside pressure. Adding to the bearish narrative is the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which has been trending lower, signaling intensified selling pressure. Currently hovering near oversold levels, the RSI reflects waning buyer interest and heightened dominance by sellers. Should the trend continue, it could pave the way for the altcoin to break below the $0.8119 mark, possibly triggering a new wave of selling. Potential Scenarios: Break Below $0.8119 Or Rebound? If ADA fails to hold above $0.8119, it may signal a continuation of downbeat momentum, potentially triggering a deeper decline. In this case, sellers might push the price toward lower support zones such as $0.6822 or even $0.5229 areas that have previously acted as stabilizing levels during market downturns. A break below $0.8119 would likely confirm seller dominance, further eroding market confidence and leading to heightened volatility. Related Reading: Cardano Could Be Heading For A 20% Correction – Technical Data Signals Bearish Price Structure On the other hand, a successful defense of the $0.8119 level could lay the groundwork for a rebound. Buyers may seize the opportunity to regain control, leveraging the support level as a springboard for recovery. This could result in ADA attempting to revisit resistance levels near $1.2630 or higher, reversing the bearish trend and reigniting optimism in the market.

38000054,https://coinpedia.org/?p=396455,1734948003,Trump Names Stephen Miran as CEA Chair: A Boost for Crypto Markets?,"The post Trump Names Stephen Miran as CEA Chair: A Boost for Crypto Markets? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In a bold step towards making the U.S. a global leader in crypto, President-elect Donald Trump has named Stephen Miran as the Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA). Miran, a seasoned economist and a known advocate for digital assets, previously served as a Treasury official during Trump’s first term and is currently with Hudson Bay Capital Management. I am beyond honored that President Trump has chosen me to lead his Council of Economic Advisers. I look forward to working to help implement the President's policy agenda to create a booming, noninflationary economy that brings prosperity to all Americans! pic.twitter.com/CROmzuk61v — Stephen Miran (@SteveMiran) December 22, 2024 This move is considered Trump’s masterstroke to pump the shallowed faith of crypto investors after the Fed’s hawkish stance on Bitcoin dropping Bitcoin to its lowest. Will these moves help crypto recover from the dent? Let’s understand. A Crypto-Friendly Leader Miran’s appointment is part of a series of moves by the new administration to support cryptocurrency. He has always been a strong supporter of changing U.S. crypto rules to encourage new ideas and growth in the blockchain industry. In a recent podcast , Miran stressed the importance of clear regulations, believing they are crucial for the U.S. to stay competitive in the digital economy. Miran has shown independent thinking, especially in his criticism of the Federal Reserve’s policies. In 2020, he disagreed with Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s call for more stimulus, arguing it was both politically and economically flawed. As the new head of the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA), Miran is expected to bring a fresh outlook on economic strategies, including those related to digital assets like cryptocurrency. Trump’s Crypto Agenda Miran’s appointment fits perfectly with Trump’s goal to make the U.S. the “crypto capital of the planet.” Trump has proposed bold ideas like creating a strategic bitcoin reserve and has consistently pushed to integrate digital assets into the country’s economy. Trump also appointed Bo Hines as Executive Director of the Presidential Council of Advisers for Digital Assets. While Hines doesn’t have a crypto background, he will work closely with David Sacks, the administration’s “Crypto Czar,” to push forward the White House’s digital asset plans. Impact on Crypto Assets The series of pro-crypto appointments have already triggered bullish sentiment in the digital asset market. Bitcoin and Ethereum saw modest gains following the news. Analysts predict that Miran’s leadership, coupled with Trump’s crypto-forward policies, could pave the way for a surge in mainstream adoption. Even though BTC is technically on the verge of a breakout, analysts are waiting for some major crypto policy changes to see a green zone once again.

Recent reports suggest that the United States could significantly reduce its national debt by establishing a Bitcoin reserve, while the cryptocurrency's current low social sentiment may indicate a near-term recovery above $100,000. US National Debt Could Shrink by 35% With Bitcoin Reserve, Says VanEck Report Asset management firm VanEck has suggested that the United States could reduce its national debt by 35% over the next 24 years by establishing a Bitcoin reserve of 1 million BTC. This idea, aligned with a bill proposed by Senator Cynthia Lummis, brings attention to the transformative potential of Bitcoin in offsetting the nation’s mounting liabilities. VanEck’s analysis projects a 25% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) for Bitcoin , which could see its price soar to $42.3 million by 2049. Simultaneously, US national debt is expected to grow at a 5% CAGR, increasing from $37 trillion in 2025 to an astronomical $119.3 trillion by the same year. If Bitcoin’s growth aligns with these estimates, a 1-million-BTC reserve could offset roughly $42 trillion in liabilities, equivalent to 35% of the projected national debt. VanEck’s head of digital asset research, Matthew Sigel, and investment analyst Nathan Frankovitz detailed these findings in a Dec. 20 report . They emphasized that the plan hinges on an optimistic scenario in which Bitcoin’s price begins its growth trajectory at $200,000 in 2025, more than doubling from its current value of around $95,360. If Bitcoin were to reach $42.3 million, it would account for approximately 18% of the world’s financial assets—a staggering increase from its current 0.22% share of the $900 trillion global market. The concept of a national Bitcoin reserve has gained traction amid speculation that the incoming Trump administration might explore this idea. Reports suggest that former President Donald Trump’s administration is considering designating Bitcoin as a reserve asset via an executive order on his first day back in office, a move that has already fueled Bitcoin’s rally into six-figure territory. Senator Cynthia Lummis, a staunch advocate for cryptocurrency adoption, has introduced legislation to formalize such a reserve. However, her bill has yet to be reviewed by Congress. If enacted, the US could leverage its existing 198,100 BTC from asset seizures and acquire the remaining 801,900 BTC through measures like selling a portion of its $455 billion gold reserves. Crucially, this approach avoids the need for taxpayer funds or additional money printing. Ripple Effects on Bitcoin Adoption The proposal could trigger widespread adoption of Bitcoin at multiple levels of the US economy, including state governments, corporations, and institutions. VanEck’s analysts believe such adoption would support their bullish CAGR estimates for Bitcoin and Ethereum. Furthermore, Bitcoin’s inclusion as a reserve asset could help stabilize its historically volatile boom-bust cycles, providing long-term market resilience. Beyond the United States, the report highlights Bitcoin’s potential as a settlement currency for international trade, especially among nations seeking alternatives to the US dollar. VanEck’s Sigel noted in a Dec. 21 social media post that BRICS countries—Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa—could increasingly adopt Bitcoin to sidestep escalating US sanctions, further driving its utility and value. Despite its promising outlook, the proposal faces significant hurdles. Bitcoin’s price trajectory must meet or exceed the optimistic CAGR estimates, and the US government would need to navigate the political and logistical complexities of such a strategy. Moreover, critics may question the feasibility of transitioning a portion of gold reserves into Bitcoin or the broader implications of relying on a highly volatile asset for debt reduction. VanEck’s ambitious proposal positions Bitcoin as more than just a speculative investment—it envisions the cryptocurrency as a pivotal tool in national debt management. While the road ahead is fraught with uncertainty, the potential for Bitcoin to offset trillions in US liabilities shows its transformative role in the global financial ecosystem. As Senator Lummis’ bill awaits legislative review, the world watches closely, pondering whether Bitcoin’s ascent could reshape not only markets but also national economies. Bitcoin’s Social Sentiment Hits 2024 Low: Signs Point to a $100,000 Recovery The cryptocurrency market has entered a crucial phase as Bitcoin’s social sentiment falls to its lowest point in 2024, raising hopes among contrarian analysts of a potential price recovery above the $100,000 mark. Despite a recent 10% correction from its all-time high of over $108,300 on Dec. 17, Bitcoin has managed to stabilize above $95,770 as of Dec. 23. Social media sentiment around Bitcoin has turned markedly bearish, with a ratio of four to five positive versus negative comments marking the lowest sentiment level this year. According to a Dec. 22 post by market intelligence platform Santiment, this widespread fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) among retail traders could signal an imminent price breakout. “Vocal traders are now showing severe FUD, and that's good news for contrarians who know markets move in the opposite direction of retail's expectations,” Santiment noted. Such contrarian signals often precede significant market movements, particularly in the cryptocurrency sector, where sentiment-driven trading plays a prominent role. Bitcoin’s current downturn has led to three consecutive daily red candles on its chart for the first time since early November, coinciding with the US presidential election period. This pattern has sparked discussions about the potential for a recovery, particularly among technical analysts relying on fractals and historical data to predict price movements. Fractal patterns, which identify recurring trends and key support and resistance levels, suggest an imminent rebound. Crypto analyst Elja Boom highlighted on Dec. 20 that Bitcoin’s current setup resembles past instances of rapid recovery, writing, “We have seen this before.” While optimism for a swift recovery above $100,000 is growing, some analysts caution that Bitcoin may face further downside in the near term. According to historical analysis by crypto strategist Rekt Capital, Bitcoin’s price corrections in 2017 and 2021 extended into Weeks 8 and 9 of similar market phases. As Bitcoin approaches Week 8 of its current correction, this historical context suggests the potential for short-term bearish continuation. “In 2017, Week 7 as well as Weeks 8 and 9 were also corrective. In 2021, Week 6 and Week 8 were corrective. Bitcoin is currently in Week 7 and slowly transitioning into Week 8,” Rekt Capital explained in a Dec. 21 post. Long-Term Optimism: 2025 and Beyond Looking beyond 2024, analysts project an increasingly bullish outlook for Bitcoin. Crypto services provider Matrixport forecasts that improving global macroeconomic conditions and easing monetary policies could drive Bitcoin’s price above $160,000 by the end of 2025. As inflation cools and central banks pivot towards more accommodative stances, Bitcoin may benefit as a hedge against traditional financial instability. This potential shift could attract both institutional and retail investors, further solidifying Bitcoin’s role as a digital asset powerhouse. Despite the recent correction, Bitcoin remains a star performer in 2024, boasting year-to-date gains of nearly 130%. This momentum has attracted increasing attention from institutional players, whose long-term investments could provide a stabilizing force against the volatility often associated with retail-driven markets. The potential for Bitcoin to break out above $100,000 is also supported by growing adoption across various sectors. As more corporations and institutions integrate Bitcoin into their operations, the cryptocurrency is expected to gain greater legitimacy and mainstream acceptance. Bitcoin’s current phase of low social sentiment and price correction may be a turning point for the world’s largest cryptocurrency. While short-term volatility could persist, historical patterns and emerging fractal trends point to a potential recovery above the $100,000 mark before year’s end. Looking ahead, the macroeconomic environment and institutional adoption are set to play pivotal roles in shaping Bitcoin’s trajectory, with analysts predicting an optimistic outlook for 2025 and beyond. For now, Bitcoin’s resilience amid bearish sentiment underscores its enduring appeal as a digital asset in an evolving financial landscape.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6678/van-eck-projects-bitcoin-at-42-3-million-to-aid-us-debt-reduction,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

The altcoins are not in great shape either, with many, such as XRP, ADA, and AVAX, still 3-4% down on a daily scale. BTC Keeps Struggling A lot can change in the cryptocurrency markets within a week, and this has been the case for the past seven days or so. Just last Monday and Tuesday, BTC posted fresh gains and shot up above $108,000 to mark its latest all-time high. However, the landscape started to change on Wednesday evening after the latest FOMC meeting. Bitcoin reacted with an immediate price drop to under $100,000, but that was just the start. It kept plummeting in the following days, which culminated on Friday with a price slump to $92,000. BTC managed to stop the freefall at this point and even jumped to over $99,000 on Saturday morning. However, that was short-lived again and it fell to $96,000 on Sunday and is currently sitting there. The question now arises whether the new trading week will be any different, given some of the factors that could impact BTC’s price.

Near Protocol is gaining popularity for its scalability and developer-friendly design, and Render is redefining decentralized digital rendering with its platform. Meanwhile, Rollblock , a rising star in crypto gambling, is capturing interest with its unique DeFi integration. XRP, however, is notably absent from these projections, making way for these exciting contenders. Rollblock: Transforming online gambling with web3 technology Rollblock (RBLK) is redefining the traditional casino model for the modern era through its web3-powered platform. With the online gambling market valued at $450 billion and projected to grow by 8% annually over the next decade Rollblock is perfectly positioned to disrupt this thriving sector. Unlike traditional casinos known for dishonest practices, Rollblock ensures complete transparency. Each transaction is saved on the Ethereum blockchain, enabling players to place bets securely and fairly. The platform offers over 7,000 immersive games, including poker, roulette, slots, and new titles, including Candyland and Cash Compass. Rollblock also launched a sports betting option last month, and this upgrade has received overwhelmingly positive feedback. Trust is at the heart of Rollblock’s mission, reflected in its gaming license from the respected Anjouan Gaming Authority. The casino also offers a revenue-sharing model that rewards holders. Weekly, a percent of the casino’s revenue will be used to buy back tokens, burning 60% and distributing the remaining to holders. The platform’s unique approach has attracted over 32,000 presale registrants, with RBLK tokens now priced at $0.043 in stage 9 of its ICO. Analysts believe this GambleFi gem has the potential for a meteoric rise, predicting a run to $10 by 2025 as Rollblock cements its place among the leaders in crypto gaming.

Despite that, its 24-hour trading volume jumped 81%, suggesting that investors are buying the dip. In comparison, XRP also slid by 6% during the same period. Over the last month, Near Protocol lost 11% of its value, decreasing from $5.60 to $5.02. Nonetheless, the protocol is continuing to improve its blockchain scalability features. Near Protocol’s adoption of BlockDAG technology is set to improve efficiency, delivering faster transaction speeds and enhanced security. This innovation positions Near Protocol as a candidate for blockchain leadership. Render holds strong amid market volatility Render’s value has dropped by nearly 8% over the last 24 hours and is now trading at $6.94. Despite the dip, trading volume surged by 52%, indicating steady investor confidence in Render amid market volatility. Recently, Render achieved a $5 billion market cap and solidified its position as one of the leading AI coins. Currently ranking third in social dominance among the top five AI cryptocurrencies, Render trails FET and VIRTUAL, both of which have gained traction in recent weeks. However, Render’s robust market presence keeps it a significant player in the AI and blockchain industries. While XRP faces challenges in the broader market downturn, Render’s continued advancements set it apart. Analysts suggest RNDR could hit $15 by Q1 2025, aligning with growing confidence in AI-focused cryptocurrencies, much like XRP’s steady appeal among institutional investors. Rollblock outshines XRP, Render, Near Protocol with 3000% growth potential While XRP, Render, and Near Protocol face notable declines, Rollblock is gaining momentum as the most promising contender for long-term growth.

Investors are seizing the chance to position themselves for a potentially explosive 2025, with iDEGEN (IDGN) emerging as one of the standout projects making waves in the market. Crypto pullback is an ‘opportunity’ Despite BTC plunging to near $92,000 from its all-time high above $108,000, sentiment remains bullish. Analysts suggest this pullback isn’t the bearish reversal some might expect but rather a pause as investors reposition. In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan attributed the crypto market pullback to leverage naturally ‘washing out.’ Hougan emphasized that the market’s long-term catalysts remain intact, affirming that crypto is ‘still in a strong bull market. “The drivers of the bull market are long-term and fundamental, while the drivers of the pullback are short-term and tactical. That makes the pullback an opportunity and not a reversal,” Hougan said . With top altcoins such as SOL, XRP, and ADA potentially set to rally higher, which under-the-radar tokens are investors also buying? Market experts and analysts have pointed to meme coins, RWA, and AI agents. iDEGEN looks poised as one of the tokens to watch in the meme and AI agent ecosystem. iDEGEN – not just an AI token? AI tokens exploded in the latter stages of the last bull market and flourished throughout the bear market amid market dynamics around OpenAI, Nvidia, and other companies. But in recent months, the crypto AI sector has evolved with the rise of autonomous agents. Trending since its launch last month is iDEGEN. iDEGEN takes the traditional guardrails and dumps them for an uncensored training model fully dependent on degen interactions on X. With no restrictions on what it can learn or post every 60 minutes, iDEGEN has the potential to take over as the AI agent of X and Telegram. The rise of iDEGEN on Telegram follows the AI agent’s recent v2 release. As well as X, the project now has the chance to rise through the chaotic environment of the 950 million-user app. Every hour, iDEGEN must post – anything from the latest crypto hot take, market performance, or trading alpha Is iDEGEN worth a look today? When it comes to the hottest trends in crypto this cycle, BTC’s surge to $108k is only bettered by the rise of AI agents. iDEGEN sits pretty as one of the autonomous AI agents on Solana set to make a breakout in 2025. Notably, the project’s pre-market auction which adopted a dynamic pricing model, has seen returns of over 21,253% in under 30 days. The presale has raced to $8.1 million and over 1 billion IDGN sold as interest skyrockets ahead of the token’s listing on exchanges on January 1. Recently, Binance Alpha, a new platform for potential crypto alpha by the world’s largest crypto exchange, has listed several AI agent tokens. iDEGEN, which will burn unsold IDGN presale tokens to add to scarcity, has attributes that suggest such a listing is likely.

If true, this would make the UAE one of the largest holders of the cryptocurrency globally. However, these claims remain unverified . The speculation started after a vague tweet by Binance’s former CEO, Changpeng Zhao , on December 22. Zhao referenced an unconfirmed report suggesting the UAE has accumulated approximately 411,978 BTC, worth around $40 billion. This news ignited debate within the crypto community, with opinions ranging from excitement to skepticism. Crypto analyst Trader T highlighted that, if accurate, the UAE could rank among the top three Bitcoin holders globally and potentially hold the largest Bitcoin reserves of any national government. Despite the buzz, many in the crypto space have urged caution. Bitcoin Archive, a prominent source in the field, emphasized that there is no solid evidence backing these claims. They stated, “People are treating the UAE’s $40 billion Bitcoin purchase as a fact , but all available information suggests this is just a rumor circulating on social media.” This speculation follows a pattern of rumors suggesting that wealthy nations in the Middle East, such as Saudi Arabia and Qatar, might also be increasing their Bitcoin holdings. These rumors have gained traction as Bitcoin’s price recently surged past the $90,000 mark. However, much like the UAE claims, these reports are also unconfirmed. While the UAE’s alleged Bitcoin stash remains speculative, the idea of nation-states acquiring Bitcoin has been gaining momentum. One notable example is El Salvador , which has openly embraced Bitcoin as part of its national strategy. Recently, the country purchased an additional 11 BTC, bringing its total holdings to 5,993.77 BTC, valued at approximately $575 million. El Salvador’s decision to increase its Bitcoin reserves defies recommendations from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which had previously advised against such policies. Furthermore, Max Keiser, an advisor to El Salvador’s President, disclosed plans for the country to acquire an additional 20,000 BTC. He stated, “El Salvador is transitioning to a peaceful Bitcoin standard, with a goal to significantly boost its reserves.” Although concrete evidence regarding the UAE’s Bitcoin holdings is lacking, these discussions highlight a growing trend where countries are exploring Bitcoin as a strategic asset. For now, these claims about the UAE remain part of the broader speculation surrounding state-level interest in cryptocurrency.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING | BNB,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/uae-rumored-to-hold-40-billion-in-bitcoin,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/37999920.jpeg

This proposal aligns with a bill introduced by Senator Cynthia Lummis, advocating for Bitcoin to play a central role in the country’s financial strategy. According to VanEck’s report released on December 20, the optimistic scenario assumes Bitcoin’s compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) at 25%, potentially reaching a staggering $42.3 million per Bitcoin by 2049. Simultaneously, the U.S. national debt is expected to grow at a 5% CAGR, climbing from $37 trillion in 2025 to $119.3 trillion. This strategic reserve could offset approximately $42 trillion in liabilities, VanEck’s digital asset experts, Matthew Sigel and Nathan Frankovitz, stated. For this scenario to materialize, Bitcoin’s price would need to start at $200,000 in 2025—more than double its current value of $95,360. Proposed Pathways for Bitcoin Reserve The Lummis bill suggests leveraging the 198,100 Bitcoin already seized by the U.S. government as a starting point. The remaining 801,900 Bitcoin could be acquired through creative financial measures, including reallocating part of the U.S.’s $455 billion gold reserves or using Emergency Support Functions, all without burdening taxpayers or printing more money. The prospect of Bitcoin’s price rising to $42.3 million would position it as a significant financial asset, representing 18% of the world’s $900 trillion market. This stands in stark contrast to its current 0.22% share. Geopolitical Implications Donald Trump’s incoming administration has also fueled the discussion around a Bitcoin reserve , with speculation that an executive order designating Bitcoin as a reserve asset could be issued on his first day in office. Meanwhile, Strike CEO Jack Mallers has echoed this possibility, adding to the ongoing Bitcoin price rally. VanEck believes global adoption trends could further bolster Bitcoin’s value. The report highlights potential influences from BRICS nations, suggesting that Bitcoin could increasingly serve as a settlement currency for global trade, particularly among countries aiming to bypass U.S. dollar sanctions.

VanEck’s analysis estimates that such a reserve could lower U.S. debt by approximately $42 trillion by 2049, assuming a 5% annual debt growth rate and a 25% yearly increase in Bitcoin's value. Under this projection, Bitcoin’s price would surpass $42 million , positioning it as a dominant global financial asset by mid-century. VanEck predicts that Bitcoin could eventually represent 18% of the world's total financial assets, which are expected to grow at an average rate of 7% annually. Mathew Sigel, VanEck’s head of research, highlighted Bitcoin's potential to become a major global settlement currency. He pointed out that Bitcoin could offer an alternative to the U.S. dollar, especially for nations aiming to bypass American financial sanctions. Sigel noted the increasing reliance on Bitcoin as a neutral asset for global trade agreements. To initiate this reserve, VanEck proposed several key actions, including halting the sale of Bitcoin from U.S. asset forfeiture reserves. They also suggested that policy adjustments under a potential Trump administration could accelerate the adoption of this strategy , such as revaluing gold reserves to market prices and utilizing the Exchange Stabilization Fund for Bitcoin purchases. These measures, according to VanEck, could bypass lengthy legislative processes and enable quicker implementation. However, not everyone is convinced. Venture capitalist Nic Carter expressed doubts about whether a Bitcoin reserve would genuinely strengthen the U.S. dollar or effectively manage national debt. Investor Peter Schiff offered an alternative solution, proposing the creation of a digital currency called ""USAcoin,"" modeled after Bitcoin but with improvements to enhance usability for everyday transactions. Schiff argued that such a digital currency, capped at 21 million units like Bitcoin, could provide financial stability without depending on volatile Bitcoin valuations. Despite the skepticism, VanEck remains confident that Bitcoin could play a transformative role in U.S. debt management and the global financial system. The debate highlights a growing divide between traditional financial approaches and emerging digital asset strategies. With influential figures on both sides, the future of Bitcoin in U.S. fiscal policy remains uncertain but undeniably significant.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/vaneck-bitcoin-reserve-could-cut-us-debt-by-36-by-2050,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/37999760.jpeg

The Sol Strategies news was announced by the CSE on Friday and the addition was effective as of the close of trading. Four more companies join HODL as part of the quarterly index rebalancing. Four companies have been deleted. The rebalancing means funds that track the index will need to buy HODL to replicate exposure to the index’s constituents. Here are the new additions to the CSE 25 Index: Sol Strategies stock is up 2,195% and there’s likely more to come Sol Strategies has a market capitalization of $385 million. Although its primary listing is on the CSE, it is also listed OTC in the US with the ticker CYFRF.PNK. At the close on Friday HODL was priced at $2.64, up 26.4% on the day following the announcement of yet another clutch of Solana validator acquisitions . Sol Strategies acquires SOL tokens, of which $400m worth are staked on the network at 9% APY, proving shareholders with an earnings stream in addition to the capital appreciation. The company is also actively investing in the ecosystem. Year to date Sol Strategies stock is up 2,195%. But with Solana on-chain growth exploding making it one of the busiest blockchains in the industry, there is likely to be much more upside to come. Interest in the stock is rising, as the addition to the CSE 25 shows. In another sign of growing traction, the resumé of the chairman Antanas Guoga (aka TonyG) was posted on TikTok and has received 1.4 million views. TonyG could soon be as popular as Michael Saylor, who has attracted a cult following among MSTR stock followers. Earlier this month Sol Strategies applied for its own Nasdaq listing .

It has launched its very own layer 2 solution. Currently active in testnet, the new product Unichain is attracting developers. Built using the OP Stack framework, this new project is all about improving scalability and security in DeFi. While the official mainnet launch is still months away, there’s already plenty to get excited about. Let’s have a look and explore if Uniswap Unichain is the future of DeFi. Achievements on Testnet Unichain has been quietly proving its potential on Ethereum’s Sepolia testnet since October. It handled over 50 million test transactions and deployed more than 4 million test contracts—numbers that show just how serious Uniswap is about this project. Even more impressive, the testnet has maintained 99% uptime for all critical systems. But it’s not just about flashy numbers. The project’s goal is security. That’s why Unichain plans to include permissionless fault proofs from day one on its mainnet. These proofs let users verify blockchain states and challenge any invalid transactions, building trust in the system. Unichain from its X account has shared the roadmap of the project. Back in October, we announced Unichain Today we’re sharing the official Unichain roadmap to public mainnet and beyond And we're also announcing that Unichain will go live with permissionless fault proofs from day one pic.twitter.com/BFtE9jvbIA — Unichain (@unichain) December 20, 2024 Before this can happen, though, the Sepolia testnet will go offline for maintenance starting January 6, 2025. This update will activate those fault proofs, setting the stage for a safer and more reliable network. What the Mainnet Brings The Unichain mainnet, set to launch in early 2025, isn’t just a copy of what’s already out there. It’s bringing some big innovations. Flashblocks will reduce block times to 250 milliseconds, making transactions almost instant. The Unichain Validation Network will let independent operators validate blockchain states, keeping things decentralized. Rollup-Boost by Flashbots is designed to securely build rollup blocks, ensuring both speed and safety. Once the mainnet is live, users will be able to bridge funds and interact with apps on Unichain. It will also join Optimism’s Superchain ecosystem, with Uniswap Labs taking a key role as a contributor to the OP Stack. What to Watch For Unichain, If delivers on its promises, it could set new benchmarks for Ethereum Layer 2 solutions. The emphasis on speed, security, and decentralization could change how we think about DeFi. With Uniswap already handling over $1 billion in daily transactions, the potential impact is huge. All eyes are now on the mainnet launch in 2025 . Would Unichain be able to deliver the revolutionary features it’s promising. What are your thoughts?

Saylor advocates for a clear framework to regulate digital assets in the U.S. He proposes classifying them into categories like digital commodities (e.g., Bitcoin), digital securities (e.g., stocks), digital currencies (e.g., stablecoins), digital tokens (e.g., utility tokens), NFTs (e.g., unique digital assets), and digital ABTs (backed by physical assets). Additionally, he calls for a system that establishes clear rights and responsibilities for issuers, exchanges, and owners to ensure confidence and legitimacy in the market. Key Proposals for Regulating Digital Assets He explained the opportunity for the U.S. to lead in the digital economy by implementing a strategic digital asset policy . This could strengthen the U.S. dollar, help manage national debt, and position the country as the global leader in digital assets.

Hines will collaborate with David Sacks, who oversees both crypto and AI policy, signaling a structured approach to digital asset strategy. Trump’s announcement on Truth Social emphasized the need for innovation while providing the crypto industry with essential institutional support. Hines, a former congressional candidate from North Carolina, brings political experience and connections to the role. He previously secured the Republican nomination in 2022 but lost the general election to Democrat Wiley Nickel. In 2024, he attempted another primary run in North Carolina's 6th district but finished fourth with 14.4% of the vote. Despite these setbacks, Hines maintained visibility in conservative circles, partly due to his ties to pro-crypto funding sources during his campaigns. Hines’ appointment highlights his past financial backing from crypto-affiliated Political Action Committees (PACs) , including contributions linked to former FTX executive Ryan Salame, who is currently serving a prison sentence for campaign finance violations. These connections have sparked discussions about Hines' role in shaping future crypto policy. In his statement, Hines expressed enthusiasm for his new position, saying he looks forward to working with David Sacks to foster innovation in the digital assets industry. He emphasized the importance of ensuring the sector thrives as a key driver of the nation's technological progress. While Hines lacks a detailed public record on crypto policy, his appointment alongside an established figure like David Sacks suggests a shift toward a more structured and integrated approach to digital asset regulation. The creation of a dedicated ""Crypto Council"" under Trump's advisory framework signals a heightened focus on balancing innovation with regulatory oversight . This move comes at a critical time for the crypto industry, which faces ongoing regulatory challenges and increasing pressure for institutional adoption. The effectiveness of this advisory council will depend on how well it manages to address industry concerns while promoting sustainable growth. Trump’s decision to bring Hines and Sacks together reflects a broader strategy aimed at strengthening the role of digital assets in the U.S. economy. Observers will be watching closely to see if this team can deliver meaningful policy outcomes in an industry often marked by volatility and uncertainty.",POSITIVE,없음,REGULATION,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/trump-appoints-bo-hines-to-lead-digital-assets-advisory-council,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/37999532.jpeg

The notice urges international authorities to locate and detain him for extradition. Heart, whose real name is Richard James Schueler, faces claims of failing to meet tax obligations worth hundreds of millions of euros and allegedly assaulting a 16-year-old. Despite the gravity of these accusations, Heart remains defiant, dismissing the charges as part of a conspiracy against him. He expressed confidence in his projects and voiced hope that the anticipated Trump administration would bring favorable outcomes for his legal battles. In a public statement, Heart said he feels safe and excited about the future, emphasizing that his platforms — HEX, PulseChain, and PulseX — are operating successfully. Earlier this year, Heart’s legal team attempted to counter the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's ( SEC ) allegations of securities fraud in a letter addressed to Judge Carol Bagley Amon of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The SEC’s investigation is part of an ongoing scrutiny of his business operations. Surprisingly, the price of the HEX token surged by 30% following the announcement of the Red Notice, reflecting an unusual market reaction. However, this spike has been overshadowed by a significant drop in HEX’s market capitalization, which has reportedly halved in December. PulseX, another project tied to Heart, also experienced a sharp decline in total value locked, falling by nearly $200 million within the same period. Heart continues to maintain his innocence, portraying himself as a visionary being targeted by powerful adversaries. He claims his lifelong preparation for future challenges is now paying off and insists that his projects remain resilient despite legal and financial setbacks. While Interpol intensifies its efforts to apprehend Heart, the cryptocurrency community remains divided. Some supporters view him as a misunderstood innovator, while critics see him as a symbol of excess and unaccountability within the sector. Regardless of opinions, the outcome of Heart’s legal battles will likely have far-reaching consequences for the projects he founded and for investor confidence in his platforms.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/hex-founder-richard-heart-wanted-by-interpol-for-tax-fraud-and-assault,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/37999436.jpeg

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. AI predicts Rollblock as the next big crypto, blending utility and meme coin culture for explosive growth potential. Table of Contents Rollblock blends utility with meme coin culture in gambling industry Solana finds staggering success as top utility token of 2024 Dogecoin rally shows importance of community in crypto value AI sees stellar 2025 growth for Rollblock When we asked AI which crypto token was next to pump after Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin (DOGE), it gave us a simple answer: Rollblock (RBLK). AI pointed out that this GambleFi protocol combines the utility of Solana with the meme coin community of Dogecoin. AI also mentioned that this altcoin’s small market capitalization means that it could rally more than 10,000% higher once its crypto presale ends, with early investors already seeing returns of over 300%. Rollblock blends utility with meme coin culture in gambling industry Rollblock has discovered the perfect opportunity in the lucrative gambling industry. The market generates over $500 billion in revenue each year, an increasing share of which is migrating online every day. Meanwhile, legacy online sites are plagued by backward technology and a poor player experience. Rollblock uses blockchain technology and meme coin culture to completely transform the online gambling experience. Instead of red tape, hidden fees and long delays, Rollblock players enjoy instant, transparent and seamless access to both global sports betting and over 7,000 of the industry’s best casino games. Rollblock has also used meme coin culture to enhance the player experience with its own massive social media ecosystem and a suite of generous rewards programs. Rollblock’s commitment to the community includes a weekly revenue-sharing program. This program operates RBLK buybacks through the casino’s own revenue and then either gives them out as high-APY rewards for staking or burns them in weekly events to drive market value. AI has identified Rollblock’s online gambling approach as the perfect blend of crypto utility with meme coin culture in a market that is primed for explosive growth. RBLK tokens are currently on sale at $0.043 at the time of writing, making now a fantastic opportunity to get involved. Solana finds staggering success as top utility token of 2024 AI identified Solana’s role in the meme coin market as the key to its staggering success. The Solana price rose over 1,000% from late 2023 as it came to redefine the market for Layer 1 blockchains. While other Layer 1 blockchains were struggling with the perennial problem of external scaling solutions, Solana’s internal solution set it apart. Solana was able to rapidly scale up to challenge the largest Layer 1 blockchain ecosystems by many metrics. Now Solana is poised to become the largest Layer 1 blockchain as it rapidly scales from its current price of $182.13. Dogecoin rally shows importance of community in crypto value The blistering year-end rally in the Dogecoin price was fueled not by utility but by its massive meme coin community. The Dogecoin price rallied over 300% in a matter of weeks as its community made it the top meme coin for celebrating Donald Trump’s election victory. Dogecoin’s meme coin rally demonstrates the importance of community in creating crypto value. Dogecoin continues to have the biggest and most dedicated community with some community members anticipating a price increase to $1 in 2025. AI sees stellar 2025 growth for Rollblock AI suggests that Rollblock perfectly captures the value created by both Solana and Dogecoin in 2024. Now this top altcoin is poised for more than 10,000% growth when its crypto presale ends, with only days remaining for its current stage nine price of $0.043.

37999297,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=666312,1734946220,What’s The Worst Case Scenario For Bitcoin Right Now? Analyst Explains,"In his latest video published on December 21, crypto analyst Rekt Capital tried to answer the question “What’s The Worst Case Scenario For Bitcoin Right Now?”. After reaching a new all-time high at $108,374 on December 17, the BTC price is down more than -11%. How Low Can Bitcoin Price Go? Rekt Capital put the Bitcoin price pullback in a historical perspective, underscoring the historical importance of weeks 6, 7, and 8 in a “price discovery uptrend.” Drawing upon past cycles such as 2013, 2016–2017, and 2021, he explained that Bitcoin has a strong tendency to correct during these specific windows, with some dips reaching as steep as 34% or even higher. “Understanding these weeks is crucial because they tend to be problematic for Bitcoin,” Rekt Capital stated, referencing past cycles where significant downturns occurred within this timeframe. For instance, in week 7 of the 2013 cycle, Bitcoin experienced a dramatic 75% pullback over 13 weeks. Similarly, the 2016-2017 period saw a 34% decline in week 8, underscoring the recurring vulnerability during these specific weeks. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Top In For This Cycle? On-Chain Signals You Need To Know As of the current cycle, Bitcoin has undergone a 10%+ retracement, bringing its price into a historically critical support zone at $96,537 on the weekly chart. Rekt Capital emphasized the importance of this support level, noting, “This area of historical support has enabled the move to $108,000.” He cautioned that failure to maintain this support could trigger a more severe correction down to $89,830. Examining the price action of the last few days, Rekt Capital pointed out the emergence of a bearish engulfing candle in the weekly timeframe—a technical indicator often associated with potential reversals. “We’re losing resistances that turned into support,” he observed. This loss signifies a potential transition into a corrective period, as the price struggles to maintain its upward trajectory. Related Reading: Analyst Says Bitcoin Price Peak Lies Above $225,000, The Timeline Will Shock You Rekt Capital also pointed out the importance of maintaining the 5-week technical line in his analysis. “If we lose this 5-week technical uptrend and the orange trend line, it would be mounting evidence that we might be transitioning into a corrective period,” he warned. Furthermore, he addressed the CME gap between the $78,000 and $80,000 price levels, a critical area that has remained unfilled. “Delving into 26%, 27%, 28% dips could fill the entire CME gap,” Rekt Capital noted. Historically, CME gaps have the tendency to get filled whereas there are a few ones which have never been filled. Despite all cautionary signals, Rekt Capital maintains a bullish stance in the long-term “These pullbacks are what enable future uptrends in the parabolic phase of the cycle,” he explained. Drawing from previous cycles, he illustrated how corrections have historically provided the necessary “breather” for the market. In the 2021 cycle, for example, Bitcoin experienced a 16% pullback in week 6 and an 8% dip in week 8, yet the overall trend continued upward. Similarly, the current 10% retracement, while significant, could serve as a preparatory phase for the next leg of price discovery. At press time, BTC traded at $95,000.

37999283,https://crypto.news/?p=14321533,1734946182,Nokia patents technology for encrypting digital assets,"Nokia takes a major step toward securing cryptocurrencies with a new encryption patent. Nokia Technologies Co., Ltd. reportedly filed for a patent on Dec. 23, 2024, under the title “Device method and computer program” to improve the encryption of digital assets. The patent was submitted to the National Intellectual Property Administration in Jun. 2024 and was given publication number CN 119155674 A. Nokia is making a big move by entering the rapidly growing field of digital asset encryption, which is becoming crucial in the blockchain and cryptocurrency sectors. According to the abstract of the patent, this proposed system described in the patent will allow user devices to securely encrypt digital assets using a “first key,” which is employed to encrypt the assets and ensure their security. This key is likely part of a symmetric or asymmetric encryption system, where a single key (symmetric) or a pair of public/private keys (asymmetric) is used to ensure that only authorized parties can decrypt and access the digital asset. You might also like: News COPA and Unified Patents launch ‘Blockchain Zone’ to combat patent trolls The process of transforming data or information into a code to stop unwanted access is known as encryption. Encryption guarantees that only people with permission can access and manage digital assets like Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. In the case of Bitcoin ( BTC ), for instance, encryption ensures that only the private key holder can access and manage the coins stored in a wallet. In the absence of encryption, any digital asset can be susceptible to theft and hacking. Following the application of the ‘first key’, a “first network function” is then provided with the encrypted assets and an index that monitors the encryption process for further handling, which may involve processing or verification. To ensure the secure and traceable management of digital assets across networks, the system also features a mechanism for identifying these encrypted digital assets. This identification is subsequently sent to a first entity for validation or authorization, with the first network function acting as a trusted node or service that processes the encrypted assets and performs tasks such as additional verification. The patent serves as an identification process that ensures that the assets are traceable and can be validated by the right parties before they are transferred or used in a transaction.

From a Pure TA perspective (ignoring fundamentals for a moment), this could be the most pivotal price action in XRP's… pic.twitter.com/Hrx225lglT — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) December 20, 2024 Key Price Milestone on the Yearly Candle The 12-month (yearly) candle provides a clearer view of XRP’s long-term direction. A crucial price level to monitor is $1.99. This corresponds to the closing body of XRP’s 2017 yearly candle. If XRP successfully closes above this level, it would represent a historic breakthrough, signaling the beginning of a new growth phase. Such a move could lead to increased investor confidence and heightened demand, reinforcing XRP’s upward momentum in the market. Impact of Demand Dynamics on XRP’s Price Demand dynamics play a vital role in shaping XRP’s price behavior. When prices rise, demand often remains inelastic, meaning buyers continue to purchase despite higher costs. This phenomenon is largely fueled by FOMO (fear of missing out) and investor anticipation of further gains. However, as prices escalate, demand can become more elastic, as some buyers may hesitate to commit at elevated levels. Key factors such as utility-driven adoption, institutional interest, and the introduction of ETFs could sustain demand even at higher price points, mitigating the risk of demand fatigue. Momentum from Bi-Annual and Quarterly Charts The 6-month (bi-annual) and 3-month (quarterly) charts provide insight into XRP’s market behavior. Unlike the highly volatile cycle in 2017, the bi-annual chart suggests a steadier and more controlled growth trajectory this time. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP’s Exponential Moving Average (EMA) reflects consistent upward momentum, with a 30-degree angle suggesting a sustainable growth pattern and reducing the likelihood of sudden trend reversals. Furthermore, the quarterly RSI (Relative Strength Index) is already above 70, signaling strong upward momentum. Analysts project the RSI could rise to 87 or even 96, indicating the possibility of substantial price increases in the near term. Bi-Monthly Chart Highlights a Bullish Scenario The bi-monthly (2-month) chart reveals a bullish setup as XRP is currently positioned above equilibrium, a level it last held prior to a massive 13x price rally. This positioning suggests that XRP could be on the verge of another significant upward movement, with potential targets as high as $13 becoming increasingly achievable. Current Price and Market Outlook As of press time, XRP is trading at $2.23. With the market becoming increasingly competitive, investors are closely monitoring critical price levels and indicators. If current momentum persists and key technical levels are breached, XRP could achieve the ambitious target of $50 by early January 2025.

While altcoins were expected to follow the trend and some popular ones are doing so, cryptos like Algorand (ALGO) and Aave (AAVE) have stood apart. The growing interest in these tokens suggests that a liquidity flow from Bitcoin to altcoins has begun, which may continue for some time. Algorand (ALGO) Preparing for a 40% Upswing Algorand attracted huge bullish attention soon after its breakout in the first few days of November, which raised the price by over 470%. Currently, the price is facing some pullback, primarily due to less participation of bulls. However, this period is expected to fade off soon as the technicals have flashed massive bullish signals, suggesting a bullish close for the year. As seen in the above chart, the ALGO price faced a 35% correction followed by a decent rise in the price. Although the volume has entered the restrictive range, it may not ascertain the rise in the dominance of bears. The MACD suggests a drop in selling pressure while the DMI is heading towards a bullish crossover. Hence the price is stuck below 0.5 FIB and is expected to breach the levels and reclaim the yearly highs, probably before the year-end. AAVE Price May Reach $500 if These Levels are Secured in 2024 The AAVE price triggered a consolidated ascending trend since the start of the second half of the year that revived the possibility of reaching $500. Meanwhile, a couple of pullbacks hindered the progress of the rally but eventually, the latest rebound revived the upper targets. Therefore, the price is now believed to maintain a consolidated ascending trend for the rest of 2024 and secure the important resistance required to start 2025 on a bullish note. The AAVE price has broken above the rising parallel channel followed by a pullback. However, the token has revamped a strong rebound and is about to test the resistance of the channel, flashing bullish signals. Besides, DMI failed to validate a bearish crossover while the levels flipped completely and a strong bullish divergence in RSI suggests a continuation of a bullish trend. Therefore, it is now important for the token to secure an important resistance at $420.03 that may lead the price to $500 in the first few days of 2025.",POSITIVE,AAVE | ALGO,AAVE | ALGO | ALTCOIN | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/liquidity-flows-into-these-altcoins-algo-and-aave-prices-prepare-for-a-strong-bullish-action/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Daddy Pepe (DADDPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 11,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DADDPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Daddy Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Daddy Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Daddy Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Daddy Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Daddy Pepe by entering its contract address – 9UFnMabUe7wecdEEzAYPoQPZiuTJ1hTFpNz6qtsiB3FA – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DADDPEPE.

In just over 24 hours, BTC dropped from around $108,000 to its current level of $95,000, as the Fed’s announcement about reducing rate cuts in 2025 hit the market hard. The drop led to BTC posting its first weekly decline since Donald Trump won the elections, with the asset down 9% over the past week. Almost all cryptocurrencies registered double-digit losses over the weekend, with BTC’s losses dwarfed by those of Ethereum (ETH), down nearly 15% over the past week as it slipped below $3,500. Solana (SOL) is down almost 3% in the past 24 hours and nearly 16% over the past week thanks to substantial losses over the weekend. Meanwhile, Dogecoin (DOGE) is down almost 21% over the past week. The crypto market cap is down just over 1.1% and currently sits at $3.3 trillion. Major Crypto Bloodbath The cryptocurrency market faced one of its biggest meltdowns in recent memory with $1.2 billion in liquidations as prices tumbled across the board. As a result, Bitcoin (BTC) fell from an all-time high of over $108,000 to below $95,000. Other major cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Dogecoin (DOGE) registered double-digit losses as the crypto market took a bearish turn. The downturn started after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s comments after the FOMC meeting. The markets, slowing down after a huge rally since Trump’s election, tumbled after Powell and the Fed took a hawkish stance and raised concerns about inflation. Powell also said the Fed would reduce rate cuts in 2025 from the forecasted four to two, triggering a significant selloff. Bitcoin (BTC)’s sharp fall Bitcoin (BTC) fell sharply over the weekend after the Federal Reserve’s warning about inflation. As a result, around $500 billion was wiped out from the market. BTC dropped around 10% but was dwarfed by losses by Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Dogecoin (DOGE). Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned that interest rates will not come down as quickly as expected and reduced the number of planned interest rate cuts to just two in 2025. BTC is currently trading around the $95,500 level. Meanwhile, Cathie Wood, the founder of Ark Invest Capital, has reiterated her stance on BTC’s price. Wood predicted BTC would touch $1 million by 2030, giving BTC a market capitalization of $20 trillion. “[Bitcoin] is becoming even more scarce than gold. The difference between gold and bitcoin is, when the gold price goes up, as it has, production goes up, the rate of increase in the supply goes up—that can not happen with bitcoin.” Analysts expect BTC and other cryptocurrencies to be prone to wild price swings over the holidays and the next few weeks. James Tolenado, Chief Operating Officer at Unity Wallet, stated, “In terms of what is coming over the holiday period, the first rule of Bitcoin is that it is always volatile in the same way water is always wet. Its behavior is always mixed, and there is zero discernible pattern at the end of the year and going into the next. Sometimes, the price rises in the new year, and at other times it falls. So, historically, we can say that bitcoin exhibits typically mixed behavior over Christmas and New Year.” Coinbase, Kraken Donate $1M Towards Trump Inauguration Several cryptocurrency firms, including Coinbase and Kraken, have donated towards Donald Trump’s inauguration. Coinbase and Kraken have donated $1 million each to the Trump-Vance inaugural committee. The committee is organizing events surrounding the January 20 swearing-in ceremony, including galas, parades, and dinners. Ripple has also pledged $5 million in XRP to the committee. Kara Calvert, Coinbase’s VP of US Policy, stated, “Coinbase is committed to working with the Administration and both sides of the aisle to create regulatory clarity for crypto. We’re eager to work with the most pro-crypto Administration in U.S. history as we build the future of crypto in America.” MoonPay has also pledged to donate to the inaugural committee, although the exact amount was not disclosed. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) dipped below $96,000 over the weekend and fell to an intraday low of $92,072 on Friday. The drop comes after BTC surged past $100,000 to set a new all-time high, as the asset witnesses wild price swings. Analysts have said the price swings are the result of traders locking in profits after BTC crossed $100,000. BTC has been highly bullish since Trump’s election victory but experienced its first weekly decline since after markets turned bearish. BTC’s decline can also be attributed to statements by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who announced rate cuts would be reduced in 2025. Powell also stated the Fed is prohibited from holding BTC or other cryptocurrencies as reserve assets Despite BTC’s slump, analysts are confident about a recovery, with some suggesting it could go past $150,000 in 2025 thanks to growing institutional interest and favorable policies under the Trump administration. However, the weekend’s decline led to $258 million in liquidations across derivatives markets, including $30 million in long positions. Sentiment around BTC changed after it set a new all-time high on Tuesday. The asset started the previous week on a positive note, rising 1.50% to $105,746 on Monday. BTC continued to push higher on Tuesday, setting a new all-time high as it raced to $108,269. However, sentiment around BTC changed on Wednesday as the price plummeted almost 6% to $100,195. Buyers attempted a recovery on Thursday as BTC rose to $102,792. However, they lost momentum after reaching this level, allowing sellers to take control. As a result, BTC fell below the 20-day SMA and $100,000, registering a drop of 2.49% and settling at $97,703. Source: TradingView BTC fell to an intraday low of $92,072 on Friday as it slipped below key support levels. However, it recovered from this level to register a marginal increase and settle at $98,124. The weekend saw bearish sentiment return as BTC fell to $97,505 after a marginal decline. Sunday saw a jump in selling activity as BTC dropped by 2.26% to $95,303, ending the weekend negatively. The current session sees BTC marginally up as buyers try to build momentum and push towards $100,000. On the other hand, if sellers retake control, BTC could drop below the 50-day SMA and go as low as $90,000. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH)’s recent decline has seen the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency slip below $3,500 after surging past $4,000 last week. ETH reached an intraday high of $4,106 last Monday as bullish sentiment peaked. ETH dropped on Tuesday instead of consolidating above this level, falling by 2.33% to go below $4,000 and settle at $3,892. Bearish sentiment intensified on Wednesday as ETH dropped almost 7%, going below the 20-day SMA and settling at $3,625. Buyers attempted a recovery on Thursday as ETH reached an intraday high of $3,762. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level, dropping almost 6% to go below the $3,500 level and settling at $3,415. Source: TradingView ETH plunged to an intraday low of $3,096 on Friday, falling below the 50-day SMA as sellers attempted to drive it below $3,000. However, it recovered from this level to climb above the 50-day SMA, reclaim $3,000, and settle at $3,470. Any hope for a sustained recovery was dashed over the weekend as ETH dropped almost 4% on Saturday to go below the 50-day SMA and settle at $3,336. ETH continued to decline on Sunday after failing to mount a recovery, dropping 1.71% and settling at $3,279. The current session sees ETH marginally up as buyers attempt a recovery. Buyers will look to build momentum and push ETH above the 50-day SMA. If they are successful, ETH will target the $3,500 level. However, if sellers retake control, ETH could drop to $3,000 before seeing a recovery. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) is looking to recover after dropping to its support level of $180 over the weekend. SOL suffered a monumental decline after turning bearish on Wednesday, with the altcoin down almost 16% over the past week. SOL started the week in the red in an indication of things to come, dropping 3.55% to $216. However, it recovered on Tuesday, rising to an intraday high of $228 before settling at $223, an increase of 3.23%. Bearish sentiment returned Wednesday as SOL dropped by 7.50% to go below the 50-day SMA and settle at $206. Sellers retained control on Thursday as SOL slipped below $200 after a drop of just over 6% and settled at $193. Source: TradingView SOL plummeted to an intraday low of $175 on Friday, briefly falling below the $180 support level. However, it recovered to thwart selling pressure and registered a marginal increase to settle at $194. The recovery was short-lived as SOL was back in the red on Saturday after a failed attempt to reclaim $200. SOL reached an intraday high of $202 before turning bearish as sellers took control. As a result, SOL dropped almost 7% and fell to $181, just above the $180 support level. Buyers attempted a recovery on Sunday as SOL rose to an intraday high of $187 before losing momentum. As a result, SOL registered a marginal decline and settled at $180. SOL has recovered during the current session but is witnessing significant volatility, having dropped to an intraday low of $176 and an intraday high of $187 before settling at $181, a marginal increase. Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Analysis Bearish sentiment around Dogecoin (DOGE) intensified last week as it plummeted below the 50-day SMA and a key support level. DOGE started the week in the red, dropping just over 1% on Monday and settling at $0.401. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as the price fell just over 2% to go below $0.40 and settle at $0.393. Bearish sentiment intensified on Wednesday as DOGE dropped over 9% and settled at $0.357, just above the $0.30 support level. DOGE registered a more substantial drop on Thursday, falling over 12% to slip below the 50-day SMA and a key support level to settle at $9.313. Source: TradingView DOGE plummeted to a low of $0.262 on Friday as sellers attempted to drive it below $0.30.

As a result, it dropped back and settled at $0.319, registering only a marginal increase. However, it was back in the red on Sunday dropping by 2.47% and settling at $0.312. The current session sees DOGE marginally down as sellers attempt to push it below $0.30. Ripple (XRP) Price Analysis Ripple (XRP) has been trading downwards since hitting an intraday high of $2.72 on Tuesday. After reaching this level, XRP fell back, dropping to $2.56, ultimately registering an increase of 3.38%.

However, it could not go higher and fell by 3.10% to settle at $2.23. Bearish sentiment intensified on Friday as XRP dropped to an intraday low of $1.95. However, it recovered from this level to register an increase of 1.83%, settling at $2.27. Source: TradingView XRP could not sustain its recovery and fell back in the red on Saturday, dropping almost 2% and settling at $2.23. Sellers retained control on Sunday, pushing XRP down by 1.58% to $2.20. XRP has remained in the red during the current session, down 1.27% and trading at $2.17. Aptos (APT) Price Analysis Aptos (APT) has plummeted over the past week and is down a staggering 35% in the past seven days as bears tighten their grip. APT’s decline began on Tuesday when it fell over 7%, going below the 20-day SMA and settling at $12.92.

Lightchain AI (LCAI), currently priced at $0.003, is drawing significant attention for its innovative integration of blockchain and artificial intelligence. While Ethereum is primarily known for its focus on smart contracts, LCAI introduces advanced features through its Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism and Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM). Ethereum’s Current Dominance and Limitations Ethereum (ETH) stays ͏as a top blockchain place, taking a big part of the decentralized money (DeFi) and unique token (NFT) markets. In the last 30 days, Ethereum saw an on-chain deal amount of $149.9 billion, way more than its nearest rival BNB Chain which had $26.6 billion. This 37 7 percent rise shows Ethereum's strength in a blockchain world. Even with its lead, Ethereum has problems, mainly speed and big fees. The network's typical fee is $7.50 which can be too much when many people use it at once. To fix these troubles, Ethereum is using methods like splitting data and zkEVM machines to make transactions faster and lower costs. Additionally, Ethereum's market dominance has declined, reaching its lowest point since 2021. This shift is attributed to strategic dilemmas and mixed signals from the Ethereum network, as well as increased competition from other blockchain platforms. Lightchain AI’s Rapid Growth and Unique Features Here are some key features that make Lightchain AI a promising contender for surpassing Apologies for the earlier repetition. Here's an expanded overview of Lightchain AI's features and growth Rising Demand for AI Solutions Artificial Intelligence (AI) is set to play an increasingly crucial role across industries. By combining AI with blockchain technology, this token positions itself at the forefront of two booming markets. As demand for AI solutions continues to soar, this token has the potential to benefit from the increased adoption of AI-powered dApps and blockchain-driven automation. Massive Market Opportunity The blockchain and AI industries are both rapidly growing, but their combined power offers even greater potential. With its unique features like the AIVM and PoI, the token is poised to capture market share across a range of sectors. This could include everything from decentralized finance (DeFi) to AI governance, opening up numerous avenues for growth. Strong Roadmap and Milestones The project has a clear and achievable roadmap, with key milestones expected in the coming months. From the mainnet launch to AI-powered dApp rollouts, the project is setting itself up for long-term success. As it continues to reach milestones and improve its offerings, the token’s market position will only strengthen. Growing Community Support While the token may not have as large a community as Shiba Inu, it’s quickly gaining traction and support from early investors. As more people learn about its unique value proposition and potential for growth, the community is expected to continue expanding. Market Trends Favoring Decentralized AI Platforms Over Traditional Blockchain As AI continues to gain traction across industries, the demand for decentralized AI platforms is growing. Lightchain AI capitalizes on this trend by providing a platform designed specifically for AI-powered decentralized applications. While Ethereum has been a staple in the blockchain world, its lack of AI integration limits its ability to meet the evolving needs of businesses seeking smart, AI-driven solutions. In contrast, Lightchain AI's integration of AI with blockchain positions it as a leader in the emerging market for decentralized AI. Investors are recognizing this shift and moving toward LCAI, as it aligns with the future of blockchain technology. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

37998531,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=632153,1734944221,Can traders trust Binance Alpha-launched projects? 41% of its projects tank,"In a recent analysis, Binance Alpha, the innovative feature within Binance’s Web3 Wallet, completed the listing of 29 new tokens over the past week. More than 40% of the tokens have plummeted in value, and investors are now “raising eyebrows” on whether Binance Alpha projects are worth looking towards. According to an insight shared on X by @sankin_eth on X, 17 of the 29 tokens that debuted on Binance Alpha have yielded returns for investors, while 12, representing 41% of the total have shown a decrease in their Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV) from their initial listing values. The market capitalization of these tokens at the time of listing ranged significantly, with the highest valued less than a billion dollars and the lowest above ten million. Binance Smart Chain (BSC) accounted for 41.4% of the listed assets. In terms of thematic classification or ‘narrative’, the tokens were categorized into six sectors, with artificial intelligence (AI) agents, animal-themed memes, and DeFi being the most prominent. Tokens plummet after Binance Alpha launch Although some tokens saw substantial gains after their launch announcement, several experienced sharp declines. BOB saw the steepest drop, plummeting 23.2% within 24 hours, while BANANA fell 14.4%. PSTAKE also faced a decline, albeit less severe, with a 7% decrease over the same period. 2024-12-23 #BinanceAlpha 上线资产统计 基于 Binance Web3 Wallet 的 Binance Alpha 在上周 3 天的时间分别分四批上线了 29 个代币（第四批时只上线了 9 个代币），过了一个周末，看看这些代币截至目前的市值表现如何？ 盈亏表现 29… pic.twitter.com/rgV4AZ0mva — 做表人小郭 (@sankin_eth) December 23, 2024 According to the analysis cited by Wu Blockchain on X, Solana memecoin Fartcoin (FARTCOIN), which was released in the project’s second batch, suffered a 16% FDV downtick. DeFi tokens SYRUP and SD, launched in the same batch, also suffered the same fate, dropping 15% and 21% in FDV values, respectively. Moreover, tokens with smaller market capitalizations have shown significant volatility, with Shoggoth, FROG, BOB, TERMINUS, and GNON leading gains, each surging over 100%. Conversely, APX and GRIFFAIN recorded the steepest declines of 28% and 25%, in the mentioned order. Per @sankin_eth analysis , Binance Alpha has not yet created a significant wealth effect, suggesting that the true potential might only be realized once selected projects are listed on Binance’s main spot market. The crypto enthusiast recommended Binance Alpha to consider tokens with higher FDVs, ideally over one billion, to provide substantial growth opportunities for secondary market investors. Additionally, they emphasized on the importance of diversifying the coins further, and implementing a delisting mechanism for underperforming tokens, akin to Binance’s main exchange strategy, to maintain a curated selection of assets. Binance US set to make USD services active in 2025 Binance US, the American subsidiary of global crypto exchange Binance, is preparing to reintroduce US dollar services, aiming for an early 2025 launch. The update was shared by interim CEO Norman Reed in a recent blog post, who believes the exchange is making huge progress towards restoring the platform’s USD offerings in the US. “We are closer than ever to bringing back USD services and are focused on achieving this milestone in early 2025,” Reed stated. He further emphasized the platform’s commitment to offering low fees and high rewards to solidify its position in the competitive crypto market. The announcement follows recent comments by the exchange’s CEO Richard Teng, who, in a December 9 Bloomberg interview , described discussions about re-establishing the exchange in the United States as premature. The crypto exchange debuted in 2019, offering regulated cryptocurrency trading for American users. However, its operations faced a significant challenge in June 2023 when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against Binance. The SEC accused the company of failing to properly register Binance US as a securities exchange, and that they violated several regulatory laws.

Phoenix Group , the first cryptocurrency company in the UAE to be listed on the Abu Dhabi Stock Exchange (ADX), is planning to dual-list on the Nasdaq in 2025 to expand its worldwide footprint. Founded in 2017 and based in Abu Dhabi, the company made history in October 2023 when it was registered on the Middle Eastern stock exchange as the first private cryptocurrency and blockchain organization. With government-supported programs creating a flourishing digital economy, the UAE is quickly becoming a center for cryptocurrency innovation and a desirable destination for crypto businesses looking to go worldwide. Phoenix Group has developed into a multibillion-dollar technological conglomerate and is currently the biggest cryptocurrency mining operator in the MENA area. Currently, the firm operates 765 MW of mining facilities in the United States, Canada, and the United Arab Emirates. A vital component of Phoenix Group’s investing ventures is Bitcoin mining devices, which are pieces of hardware that solve challenging mathematical puzzles to validate transactions on the Bitcoin ( BTC ) network. Taking advantage of the growing market for mining equipment, the firm is also the only distributor of MicroBT’s BTC mining devices in countries including the GCC, Egypt, Turkey, and Kenya.

The company’s dual listing on Nasdaq may be crucial in establishing the UAE as a major participant in the blockchain and cryptocurrency sectors globally, especially if the UAE’s crypto scene picks up steam and Phoenix Group grows its presence abroad.

37998005,https://crypto.news/?p=14321542,1734943302,Cardano-Ripple collaboration? Hoskinson praises Ripple CTO in recent remarks,"Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson recently praised Ripple CTO David Schwartz, commending his leadership and Ripple’s resilience amid ongoing challenges. During a recent live stream , Hoskinson described Schwartz as ‘super smart’ and ‘really passionate,’ emphasizing his resilience despite Ripple’s ongoing legal battle with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. “Dave Schwartz is a great guy. He’s a brilliant guy. It’s a lot of fun being in meetings with him, and I love to hang out with him,” Hoskion said. He went on to highlight how Ripple, even after facing lawsuits, delistings, and regulatory hurdles, has remained steadfast and continues to push forward. Ripple has been embroiled in a legal battle with the SEC since December 2020, when the regulator accused the company of conducting an unregistered securities offering by selling XRP ( XRP ) tokens. While Ripple secured a partial victory in July 2023—when a federal judge ruled XRP is not a security when sold on public exchanges—the case remains ongoing, with appeals and unresolved penalties still in play. However, Hoskinson remains optimistic about Ripple’s future, pointing out that despite being excluded, delisted, sued, and forced to fight even after legal victories, the company remains steadfast. “They’re still here. They’re still resilient. And they got a bright future because of it.” You might also like: Cardano price may crash soon, legendary trader warns Hoskinson’s recent shift in stance toward Ripple, marked by a public apology to the XRP community on Nov. 10, has signaled a turning point in his relationship with Ripple and its advocates. Hoskinson has confirmed meeting Schwartz along with Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse to discuss potential synergies between the two ecosystems, fuelling speculations regarding a potential collaboration. Subsequently, in a Dec. 8 interview , the Cardano founder revealed that the conversation explored potential collaboration opportunities between the Cardano and XRP ecosystems, with a focus on Cardano’s privacy-centric sidechain, Midnight , and its smart contract toolkit, Marlowe. Hoskinson hopes to ‘include XRP into the Midnight story’ and believes the cryptocurrency is a better fit for Marlowe than ADA , the Cardano blockchain’s native token. He has also floated the idea of integrating Ripple’s upcoming RLUSD stablecoin into the Cardano blockchain.

Bo Hines, a former college football player and 2022 Republican candidate for North Carolina’s U.S. House seat, will work alongside David Sacks, the crypto and artificial intelligence czar for Trump’s incoming administration. In his post, Trump emphasized that Hines’ role will focus on “fostering innovation and growth in the digital assets space” while providing industry leaders with essential resources. Hines narrowly lost the 2022 election to Democrat Wiley Nickel but garnered significant support from pro-crypto super PACs, including contributions tied to Ryan Salame, the former FTX CEO currently serving a seven-year prison sentence for illegal political contributions. Strengthening the Crypto Advisory The newly established “Crypto Council,” part of the Presidential Council of Advisers for Digital Assets , is designed to streamline collaboration between the administration and the crypto industry. This council aligns with Trump’s campaign promise to transform the U.S. into a global crypto hub. Complementing Hines’ appointment, Trump named Sriram Krishnan, a former Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) general partner, as senior AI policy adviser. Krishnan expressed his gratitude via X, stating his commitment to ensuring the U.S. maintains its leadership in artificial intelligence while working closely with David Sacks. The council’s leadership reflects a strategic blend of innovation and regulatory foresight. By incorporating individuals with deep industry ties, Trump is signaling his intent to create a balanced approach to crypto regulation—one that encourages growth while ensuring oversight. Trump Appoints Pro-Crypto Figures Trump’s pro-crypto stance has also extended to other influential positions. Earlier this month, he nominated Paul Atkins , a former SEC commissioner known for his industry-friendly outlook, to head the Securities and Exchange Commission. This move has been well-received by crypto advocates, who hope it will mitigate the SEC’s stringent enforcement actions.

Are they preparing to hack the platform?","_Marked addresses linked to North Korean hackers have reportedly engaged in trading activities on Hyperliquid, resulting in losses of more than $700,000. The trading activities have stirred concerns within the crypto community, with some speculating that these actions may signal North Korean hackers testing Hyperliquid’s systems for vulnerabilities. As reported by Chinese correspondent Colin Wu, Tayvano, a crypto enthusiast on X, has warned the Hyperliquid team of an imminent threat, saying the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) “does not trade; it tests.” DPRK's trading career is…uh….going…..🙈 tbh if i was the dude managing Hyperliquid's 4 validators (or those fucking ghetto ass binaries on gh) I would be shitting my pants right now. Hyperliquid dudes dont seem worried at all though so im sure its fine. 🫠 pic.twitter.com/JrrU7t1sJe — Tay 💖 (@tayvano_) December 22, 2024 Hyperliquid (HYPE) recently hit the $11 billion trading volume mark, fueled by its recent airdrop event. Analysts are optimistic the token will surge past its recent highs of $35.02. However, recent activities from DPRK hackers have the community a little worried. Expert offers to help Hyperliquid ‘mitigate imminent threat’ Just two weeks ago, crypto KOL Tayvano reached out to Hyperliquid, offering insights and assistance to counter the perceived risks. In a letter to the crypto project, Tayvano highlighted the dangers posed by the familiarity North Korean hackers have with Hyperliquid’s platform. Source: X “I would like to walk you through some of the measures that your team can and should take to mitigate risk of a sophisticated attack,” Tayvano wrote. The letter further emphasized the evolving tactics of DPRK hackers, describing them as “creative, persistent, and highly sophisticated,” with access to zero-day vulnerabilities, such as those recently patched by Chrome. Tayvano proposed an open communication channel between Hyperliquid and security experts to share updates and countermeasures effectively, aiming to prevent the platform from becoming a high-profile target. DPRK hacks dominate 2024 crypto theft According to a Chainalysis report, North Korean state-sponsored hackers stole an estimated $1.34 billion in cryptocurrency in 2024 alone, accounting for more than half of all crypto-related thefts this year. The frequency and scale of the attacks have intensified, with the hackers targeting a wider range of organizations. Notably, DPRK-linked exploits yielding profits of $50 to $100 million—or more—occurred significantly more often this year compared to 2023. Chainalysis attributes this trend to the hackers’ growing expertise in executing massive exploits. In addition to large-scale thefts, DPRK hackers have also conducted smaller attacks, pulling in as little as $10,000. These activities showcase their ability to target both high-value entities and smaller-scale opportunities. The rise in DPRK cyber activities has also been linked to North Korean IT workers infiltrating crypto and Web3 companies . Using sophisticated tactics such as false identities, third-party hiring intermediaries, and exploiting remote work opportunities, these individuals have compromised networks and stolen proprietary information. One notable case involved the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) indicting 14 North Korean nationals accused of posing as remote IT workers at U.S. companies. These individuals reportedly stole more than $88 million through extortion and data theft. Sanctions and blacklists: Something for the pain? As international efforts to disrupt North Korea’s illicit activities continue, countries are now joining hands to break the chain of attacks the DPRK is executing. A collaboration between the US and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) recently led to the disruption of a DPRK money-laundering network. According to the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), two Chinese nationals and their UAE-based shell company, Green Alpine Trading LLC, were sanctioned for laundering millions of dollars in cryptocurrency for North Korea. The duo reportedly funneled funds for Sim Hyon-Sop, a sanctioned representative of the Korea Kwangson Banking Corporation (KKBC), who is wanted by the FBI. Sop is known for establishing complex financial pipelines to support North Korea’s weapons programs. OFAC’s sanctions freeze all US owned assets linked to the Chinese nationals and Green Alpine Trading LLC, effectively blacklisting them from global financial systems. The agency warns that financial institutions interacting with these entities may face additional penalties. The sanctions are part of broader efforts to curb North Korea’s ability to finance its weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and ballistic missile programs through illicit means, including crypto theft and money laundering operations.

BNB is trading at about $727 right now, with a surge of over $8.2% within the past week. BNB’s outlook remains positive due to Binance’s growing global presence and strategic partnerships. Despite the overall price correction in the market, BNB remains resilient, with its price soaring above the $700 mark, signaling strong investor interest.

TRON’s whale activity spikes: Positive price rally expected Recently, a TRON whale sent about 4.85 million TRX tokens worth over $1.84 million to a private wallet from Binance.

This new development makes TRON a top blockchain for whales to make large transfers. Amid the massive whale participation, TRX rose to its all-time high of $0.43 after a 90% surge, but it is now trading at a price of $0.27. TRX holders have shifted their focus to FXG, one of the best DeFi crypto coins, in order to turn $100 into $10,000.

The altcoin changed hands at $0.004312 at press time, with a 25% uptick in daily trading volume signaling intensified trader activity. That underscored significant recoveries following December struggles, which saw HEX’s market cap plunging by over 50% to $2.48 billion at press time. Technical indicators also support HEX’s upward trajectory. The altcoin hovers well above the vital 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages on the daily timeframe. That signals robust buyer strength. Further, the 4H Moving Average Convergence Divergence has approached a bullish deviation with the signal line, highlighting continued upswings in the near term. HEX will likely extend its upside to $0.4540 – another 5.29% increase from current prices before its revealing trajectory. However, broad market influence remains crucial in shaping HEX’s performance in the upcoming sessions. Bears dominate the cryptocurrency space as Trump-driven momentum fades. Bitcoin recorded its first seven-day loss since Donald Trump’s victory. BTC lost nearly 10% over the past week to trade at $95,247 at press time. The downside followed the Fed’s hawkish outlook , which dampened optimism about Trump embracing cryptocurrencies. The crypto sector displays selling signals, which could translate to short-lived HEX gains.

37997699,https://coinpedia.org/?p=396421,1734942578,Why is the Bitcoin (BTC) Price Dropping? Is This Something to Worry About?,"The post Why is the Bitcoin (BTC) Price Dropping? Is This Something to Worry About? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ever since the BTC price triggered a massive breakout to the ATH, the markets have become highly optimistic about the next price action. The upper targets were elevated beyond $110K to $115K ahead of the yearly close. However, the rally is experiencing a major hindrance, primarily because of the bulls’ weakness instead of an increase in the buying volume. This could raise some concerns about the next course of action in 2025, which is speculated to be the year of a bull run, elevating the Bitcoin price to levels above $150K. After the breakout in November, the price continued to trade within a rising parallel channel. Interestingly, the token breached the channel to mark a new ATH above $108K, which attracted bearish attention. Initially, the pullback appeared to be a small retracement, aiming to attract fresh buying volume. Meanwhile, the correction got more intense, which has raised concerns of the next price action as the rally has broken below the channel. What’s next for the BTC price rally ahead of the yearly close? The daily chart of BTC appears to be bearish as the rally has broken down the bullish pattern. But the larger concern lies within the technicals that do not pose a high risk at the moment but suggest the price may remain within an extended bearish influence. The MACD shows constant selling pressure suggesting a drop to the interim support close to $92,000. The MACD had undergone a bullish crossover, but in no time, the bearish crossover that followed validated a strong pullback. On the other hand, the OBV, or on-balance volume, a volume-based indicator, remains bearish as it trades along the descending trend line. Moreover, the OBV continued to plunge while the price maintained a steep upswing towards the highs. Hence, this suggests the upward momentum could lose strength anytime, resulting in a price reversal very soon. As the smart money does not appear to be taking part in the price movement, a breakdown has already occurred as the breakout towards the ATH was a false one. Therefore, the levels at $92,100 could be pivotal, as a rebound from here may not invalidate the bearish trajectory but keep the token within the bullish range. A failure may cause the Bitcoin (BTC) price to plunge and enter the support zone between $88,900 and $89,700. A rebound from here could revive a consolidated ascending trend; otherwise, it could be the beginning of a fresh bear market.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/why-is-the-bitcoin-btc-price-dropping-is-this-something-to-worry-about/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

The total estimated cost of the deal was around $60 million (around £47 million). As per a statement by the company, the average price for the purchase was around $96,000. This acquisition brings the company’s total Bitcoin holdings to 1,761.98 BTC, valued at approximately $168 million. The average purchase price of its total holding is around $75,600 per Bitcoin. Metaplanet’s latest Bitcoin purchase, the largest since it began acquiring the cryptocurrency in May, brings its total holdings to the 12th-largest Bitcoin stack among public companies, just behind medical tech maker Semler Scientific. Metaplanet’s Bitcoin play The latest Bitcoin acquisition follows the company’s recent bond issuances . Last week, the Tokyo-listed company announced the issuance of ¥4.5 billion ($30 million) in zero-interest bonds to expand its Bitcoin holdings, aligning with its strategy to accumulate the cryptocurrency as a core asset. This move mirrors MicroStrategy’s well-known approach of leveraging corporate reserves to acquire Bitcoin, positioning Metaplanet as a Bitcoin-focused business in Japan. The company officially designated itself as a Bitcoin Treasury company, highlighting its strategy to acquire and manage Bitcoin as a core corporate asset to protect against the declining Japanese Yen. From October 1 to December 23, Metaplanet reported a BTC Yield of 310%, significantly up from 41.7% in the previous quarter (July to September). The firm uses BTC Yield to evaluate the performance of its Bitcoin acquisition strategy, which it says aims to be accretive to shareholders. It disclosed its intention to formally establish Bitcoin accumulation and management as a business line, incorporating instruments such as loans, equity, and convertible bonds for purchasing and holding BTC. Metaplanet’s stock price With the surge in Bitcoin holdings and the impressive yield, Metaplanet’s stock price has gone up by more than 2,000% year-to-date, pushing the company’s valuation to over $1 billion. Last week, Metaplanet projected it would achieve its first operating profit since 2017 and expressed plans to extend its strategy beyond merely buying Bitcoin. The company expects to generate $5.8 million in revenue for the fiscal year ending December 31. The company’s operating profit is projected to reach $1.72 million, representing a sharp turnaround from the $2.98 million loss it reported last year. Bitcoin remains under pressure Bitcoin dropped 10% during the week ending December 22, closing at $94,645, down by around $10,500 from its starting point of $105,185, according to TradingView. This decline followed the US Federal Reserve’s decision to reduce the number of projected interest rate cuts for next year from five to two after implementing its third consecutive rate cut. Bitcoin continued its decline for the third consecutive day on Monday, trading just above the $95,300 mark, a 0.88% drop over the last 24 hours.

37998084,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52919,1734941422,XRP Is Finishing a Correctional Pattern. Here’s How Long Before $6,"A respected market analyst has outlined a timeline for XRP to achieve a $6 valuation, a milestone that would nearly double its all-time high from 2017-2018. This projection comes despite ongoing volatility in the cryptocurrency market, driven by macroeconomic and regulatory challenges. Broader Market Context XRP’s recent price activity has unfolded amid bearish sentiment across the financial markets, influenced heavily by U.S. Federal Reserve policy updates. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell recently announced that interest rate reductions in 2025 may be more gradual than anticipated, dampening market enthusiasm. In addition, discussions around potential legislation prohibiting the Federal Reserve from holding Bitcoin have introduced further uncertainty. This environment has negatively impacted the broader cryptocurrency market, with XRP seeing notable declines. On December 20, XRP experienced a sharp 9.91% drop, followed by a 3.24% loss the next day, reaching a low of $1.96. However, by December 21, the token had partially recovered, gaining 4.35% to trade at $2.37. Analysts See a Breakout Opportunity Despite the recent downturn, some analysts remain optimistic about XRP’s near-term prospects. CryptoBull, a notable market commentator, has identified a symmetrical triangle formation on XRP’s daily chart, signaling the potential for a significant breakout. According to CryptoBull, the ongoing correction could conclude soon. “This structure will resolve within the next week,” he noted, predicting that XRP’s breakout could cause a rapid surge to $6. #XRP is finishing a correctional pattern. This will be completed within the next week. After that I believe we will go to $6 within a few days. pic.twitter.com/qrAbmTEGTn — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) December 19, 2024 The symmetrical triangle emerged after XRP hit a seven-year high of $2.9 on December 3, followed by a significant correction. This pattern, commonly associated with market indecision, indicates a narrowing range as bulls and bears compete for control. The formation has unfolded in five waves: a steep decline (wave A), a partial recovery (wave B), a lower low (wave C), a potential test of the upper trendline (wave D), and a final pullback (wave E). CryptoBull anticipates that a breakout above the triangle’s resistance could set the stage for XRP to retest $2.9 before advancing to $6. Key levels identified include $2.4 as immediate resistance and $2.0 as a major support zone. A breakout above $2.4 could confirm the start of a new bullish phase. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Parallels with the 2017 Rally In another analysis , CryptoBull likened XRP’s recent price behavior to its notable rally in 2017, when the cryptocurrency entered a multi-month upward trend starting in March. CryptoBull believes XRP is following a similar trajectory, having already reached a critical level of $1.96. Based on this pattern, he forecasts that XRP could reach $6.28 by the end of December 2024. Additionally, he predicts a meteoric rise to $40 by January 2025 if the fractal behavior continues. Outlook for XRP While XRP has faced considerable headwinds from macroeconomic factors and market corrections, technical patterns, and historical parallels suggest the potential for a strong recovery. As XRP approaches the triangle’s apex, its price movement in the coming days will be critical. A breakout above $2.4 could signal the start of a new bullish cycle, with the potential to reach $6 and beyond.

The network, designed to enhance scalability and efficiency in decentralized finance, has been tested on Ethereum’s Sepolia testnet since October. The Sepolia testnet has processed over 50 million test transactions and deployed more than 4 million smart contracts, maintaining an uptime exceeding 99% across critical services, according to Uniswap . Sepolia testnet to Activate Permissionless Fault Proofs in 2025 Starting January 6, 2025, the testnet will undergo planned maintenance to activate permissionless fault proofs, a key feature that will also be integrated from the first day of the mainnet launch. Permissionless fault proofs enable participants to verify the blockchain’s state and challenge invalid withdrawals, improving the network’s security and reliability. These proofs are crucial for Ethereum Layer 2 networks, acting as safeguards against fraudulent transactions. Following the completion of safety validations, the mainnet will allow users to bridge assets and access DeFi applications built on Unichain.

To ensure decentralization and mitigate risks tied to single-sequencer systems, Unichain will introduce the Unichain Validation Network, comprising independent node operators. Additionally, it will leverage Rollup-Boost, a secure block-building platform developed by Flashbots, for enhanced rollup functionality. Upon its launch, Unichain will join Optimism’s Superchain ecosystem, with Uniswap Labs contributing to the OP Stack. The development solidifies Uniswap’s position as a leading player in decentralized finance, with over $1 billion in trading volume recorded in the past 24 hours. Uniswap Hits $38B Monthly Volume on Ethereum Layer 2s Last month, Uniswap shattered its monthly volume record on Ethereum layer-2 networks, signaling a resurgence of interest in DeFi. At the time, the decentralized exchange processed $38 billion in volume across major Ethereum layer-2 platforms like Base, Arbitrum, Polygon, Optimism, and others in November. The milestone surpasses the previous record set in March by $4 billion. In August, the Uniswap Foundation unveiled its financial summary for the second quarter , revealing a lot of cash and stablecoins and not so many UNI tokens. The report revealed that the Uniswap foundation holds $36.81 million in cash and stablecoins, alongside a modest reserve of 680,000 UNI tokens. These cash and stablecoin reserves are earmarked for grant-making and operational purposes, while the UNI tokens are allocated for employee incentives. The foundation expects these funds to support its activities until the end of 2025, with $26.12 million designated for grants and $10.69 million for operational costs. During Q2, the Uniswap Foundation approved over $3.2 million in new grants and distributed nearly $2.5 million from previously committed grants. Meanwhile, the foundation’s operating expenses for the quarter reached $1.6 million, with 8.2% directed towards advertising and marketing, 47.9% to payroll, and 35.2% to professional fees.

The small-cap memecoin project, with a fully diluted valuation of about $683 million and a 24-hour average trading volume of about $1.1 billion, dropped more than 50 percent two weeks to trade about $0.68 on Monday, December 23, 2024, during the mid-European session. After an impressive rally during and after the US 2024 elections , PNUT price has significantly slowed down in the recent past. Moreover, the ongoing Bitcoin correction has sent bearish shivers to the entire altcoin industry, resulting in further recovery of the BTC dominance to hover above 58 percent at the time of this writing. PNUT Fundamentals The PNUT memecoin has gained significant attention from speculative traders in the past few weeks following the notable listing on major cryptocurrency exchanges. Following the successful listing on the Binance exchange, which has over 240 million global users, Coinbase Global Inc . (NASDAQ: COIN) recently announced the listing of PNUT. As a result, the highly liquid memecoin with a locked liquidity of over $12 million, has attracted over 78k on-chain holders. However, the PNUT memecoin has faced significant headwinds from legal action filed by Mark Longo, alias the squirrel dad. Recently, Longo issued a cease and desist letter to Binance and Coinbase for using his former pet’s image without approval.

37997003,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=313884,1734941065,"‘Omega Candle’ Is the Next Step for Bitcoin, Says BTC Veteran Samson Mow – Here’s What He Means","A veteran of the Bitcoin ecosystem says that BTC is moving into a phase where extreme price impulses to the upside will become normalized. In a new interview on the Block Rewards podcast, Samson Mow says that BTC is almost ready to graduate from printing “god candles” – $10,000 daily moves – to “omega candles” representing $100,000 daily moves. Mow notes that in some countries with much weaker currencies than the USD, omega candles are already taking place on a regular basis. “The world’s going to change. After $100,000, I think everything starts to accelerate and go faster. So post-$100,000 we’re not going to be watching $500 candles. A $1,000 candle is already kind of normal in one day in terms of volatility, and I think the next step from that is the $10,000 and $100,000. We almost had a god candle a couple weeks ago. I think we went up $9,000 on the day. But $100,000 is the next step. Once we start to go well into the higher ranges of Bitcoin. But it just goes to show you the fiat system does not really make sense anymore because an omega candle is nothing in terms of fiat money. Like the debt increases by a couple of omega candles every day – many, many omega candles each day, but no one blinks an eye for that. There’s this disconnect between the fiat monetary system where that’s normalized. It’s growing very fast at ridiculous rates but it’s normal. But when you talk about Bitcoin, people are like ‘Whoa that’s crazy.’ But it’s not at all. So the omega candle is just a big move up in Bitcoin price. And the interesting thing is we already see omega candles in countries with weaker fiat currencies: Egypt, Turkey, Argentina even, it’s normal. Omega candles every day.” At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $96,126.

37996860,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=666320,1734940825,XRP Price On Its Way To $10 In Only 3 Months If It Follows This Pattern,"The XRP price has continued its steep correction into the past 24 hours, with it currently hovering around the $2.2 price level. Nonetheless, analysts are still concerned about the possibility of the XRP price reaching new highs sooner than later, with some giving projections into the two-digit threshold at $10 and beyond. Interestingly, crypto analyst Cryptoinsightuk recently shared his thoughts on social media platform X, drawing attention to a potential roadmap for XRP to achieve this ambitious target. Mirroring The 2017 XRP Price Pattern Cryptoinsightuk has brought a compelling perspective to the ongoing XRP price correction and its previous rally, highlighting how its current trajectory resembles the movement it experienced in 2017. Back then, XRP consolidated a little bit in early 2017 before undergoing a powerful rally that extended into 2018. Related Reading: XRP Battles Critical $2.20 Support Level — Will It Target $2.70 Or Slip To $1.96? With this in mind, technical analysis from Cryptoinsightuk adjusted the price action at that time to size in relation to XRP’s previous breakout in early October. According to this, if XRP continues to follow the 2017 pattern, the cryptocurrency could replicate this crazy move throughout 2025. Interestingly, the analyst’s overlay of the 2017 price action suggested that the XRP’s 460% price breakout from its early October range of $0.5 is already halfway into replicating this movement. If this were to continue playing out this way, the analyst expects XRP to break above $10 in the first quarter of 2025. However, Cryptoinsightuk’s projections extend beyond this initial $10 target in Q1 2025. If XRP’s price continues to mimic the historic movement beyond the first quarter, the analyst envisions what he describes as a “moon boy blow-off top.” This phase, which is characterized by a larger parabolic surge in price, could push XRP as high as $35 by the third or fourth quarter of 2025. Factors To Push XRP’s Bullish Trajectory CryptoinsightUK’s bullish outlook on XRP hinges on the cryptocurrency’s ability to replicate its 2017 movement. Back then, the parabolic surge saw XRP go from below $0.0060 until it reached its current all-time high of $3.40. Punching in the numbers, this comes up to around 56,000% gain over 12 months or so. Related Reading: Bitcoin $178K Target In Sight? Analyst Highlights Bollinger Band Retest Mirroring Jan. 2024 Rally While XRP is currently in a positive market sentiment to continue a strong bullish move, market conditions in 2024 are different from those in 2017. Furthermore, the amount of inflow capital needed to reach $10 or $35 at this point would be far greater than what it took to reach $3.4 in 2018. However, increased institutional involvement and factors like political and expected regulatory positivity in 2025 suggest that the XRP price could nonetheless go on a comparable surge. Additionally, broader crypto market trends, such as Bitcoin’s performance, could contribute to the predicted XRP price surge. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.18. Reaching the $10 and $35 price targets would translate to a 358% and 1,505% move, respectively.

37998083,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52865,1734940824,"Aptos (APT) Defies Market Selling Spree Along With DTX Exchange, But Dogecoin Loses Major Support at $0.38","With the wave of sell-offs in the crypto market currently, it is interesting to see that some assets are defying the trend. Aptos (APT) and DTX Exchange (DTX) have emerged as strong performers, showing resilience despite mounting selling pressure. However, not all tokens are holding steady—Dogecoin (DOGE) has lost critical support at $0.30, raising concerns among investors about further downside. A deeper analysis of Aptos, DTX Exchange, and Dogecoin highlights their distinct market performances and potential outlooks. Aptos (APT) Defies the Sell-Off Aptos (APT) has been one of the few cryptocurrencies to maintain strong performance in recent weeks, trading at $10.68 despite the overall bearish sentiment. Its Layer-1 blockchain, built using the Move programming language, continues to attract developers and investors seeking advanced scalability and efficiency. Source: TradingView The Aptos ecosystem is expanding steadily, evidenced by growing transaction volumes and increased wallet activity. On-chain data indicates heightened user engagement, a promising sign for long-term sustainability. Analysts are optimistic about Aptos, predicting that it could soon retest the $12 resistance level if market conditions improve. Adding to its strength, Aptos has forged strategic partnerships and announced new initiatives to enhance its ecosystem. This proactive approach has bolstered investor confidence, positioning the token as a standout amidst market uncertainty. DTX Exchange Stays Strong Amid Market Uncertainty While most assets falter under the weight of market sell-offs, DTX Exchange (DTX) continues to defy expectations with its resilience and growth potential. The decentralized exchange has positioned itself as a pioneer in DeFi, offering distributed liquidity pools that aggregate liquidity from multiple sources, enabling seamless trade execution and significantly reducing slippage for traders. DTX recently concluded its $10.24 million presale, making it one of the most successful fundraising campaigns in the DeFi space. This presale success reflects growing confidence in the platform’s innovative approach, attracting retail and institutional investors eager to capitalize on its potential. The buzz around DTX is further fueled by analysts’ forecasts of a 550% post-listing rally, driven by the platform’s solid technical foundation and market interest. Unlike many DeFi projects that struggle to differentiate themselves, DTX has managed to carve out a niche with its focus on efficiency and scalability, two factors critical to long-term success. Dogecoin Breaks Below $0.30 Support In stark contrast, Dogecoin (DOGE) has faced significant challenges. The token recently lost its critical $0.30 support level, now trading at $0.307368, marking a bearish turn after failing to break the $0.352232 resistance level. Source: TradingView This decline is compounded by decreasing trading volume and waning investor interest. A recent 4.9 billion DOGE transfer, highlighted by Whale Alert, has sparked concerns about heightened sell pressure, further eroding confidence in the token’s near-term prospects. If DOGE fails to reclaim the $0.30 mark, analysts warn it could test lower support levels around $0.27, where the 200-day EMA provides a longer-term safety net. However, Dogecoin’s inherent volatility and community-driven nature leave room for potential surprises, though the current sentiment leans bearish. Market Outlook The current market conditions highlight a clear divide: Aptos and DTX Exchange are maintaining upward momentum, while Dogecoin is struggling to recover. As Aptos aims for a potential $12 retest and DTX draws increasing investor interest, Dogecoin’s ability to stabilize will remain in question.

From multi-million-dollar breaches to sanctions targeting global laundering operations, the industry is under attack. The sheer scale of the losses raises serious questions about the security of digital assets. Who are the masterminds behind these attacks? How are platforms like WazirX and DeFi projects coping with the fallout? Let’s dive in for the full story. Billion-Dollar Hacks Hit Hard Crypto fraud continues to plague the industry, with hackers stealing $2.2 billion in 2024 alone , according to Chainalysis. This marks a 21% increase from 2023. Centralized exchanges have now become the primary targets, replacing DeFi platforms as the hardest hit. North Korean hackers remain a major threat, stealing $1.34 billion this year—more than double their total for 2023. Wazirx Under Siege: Delisting and Legal Battles India’s cryptocurrency exchange WazirX is facing serious challenges after a $235 million hack earlier this year. The Delhi High Court has called for a reinvestigation into the case, adding to the platform’s mounting problems. To make matters worse, Binance delisted the WRX token, leading to a 51% drop in its value. With trust among users eroding, WazirX is exploring options, including shifting to a decentralized exchange (DEX) model.

While opinion remains divided, major asset management firm VanEck has claimed in its latest report that a strategic Bitcoin reserve could reduce the US national debt by up to 36% by 2050. VanEck analysts stated in a recent report that the United States could reduce its national debt by 35% over the next 24 years if it created a reserve of 1 million Bitcoins under a bill proposed by Senator Cynthia Lummis. VanEck based his prediction on a Bitcoin assumption. Accordingly, if Bitcoin’s annual appreciation rate reaches 25%, its price could skyrocket to $42 million by 2049. As Bitcoin’s price increases, the US national debt will rise from $37 trillion at the beginning of 2025 to $119.3 trillion over the same period, with a 5% CAGR. At this point, VanEck head of digital asset research Matthew Sigel and investment analyst Nathan Frankovitz said, “A Bitcoin reserve created could represent approximately 35% of the national debt by 2049, offsetting approximately $42 trillion in liabilities.” Sigel and Franlovitz also suggested that the US halt the sale of Bitcoin and start initial Bitcoin purchases through the Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF). The duo added that under the Bitcoin bill presented by Lummis, the US could reuse the 198,100 Bitcoins it seized, while financing the remaining 801,900 Bitcoins through Emergency Support Functions. *This is not investment advice.

37996531,https://coinpedia.org/?p=396384,1734940099,Why Elon Musk’s SpaceX Uses Stablecoins: No Currency Risks?,"The post Why Elon Musk’s SpaceX Uses Stablecoins: No Currency Risks? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Stablecoins are becoming a go-to solution for major companies tackling financial challenges. With a market cap of over $200 billion, these digital currencies—tied to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar—offer stability and efficiency, making them a compelling alternative to traditional financial systems. But why are companies like SpaceX turning to stablecoins? What makes them so attractive? Here’s a deep dive. The Risks of Operating Globally Before exploring the benefits of stablecoins, it’s important to understand the challenges international businesses face. Take, for example, a U.S. company receiving payments in Brazilian reais (BRL). If the exchange rate fluctuates unfavorably during conversion to U.S. dollars, the company could suffer losses. SpaceX’s Starlink satellite internet service operates in many countries, including regions with unstable or weak currencies. To minimize financial risks, SpaceX has turned to stablecoins, highlighting their ability to solve real-world problems in global trade. How SpaceX Uses Stablecoins Venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya recently discussed SpaceX’s use of stablecoins on his All-In Podcast . According to Palihapitiya, SpaceX accepts payments from Starlink customers in countries with volatile currencies. These payments are converted into stablecoins and later exchanged for U.S. dollars. This strategy reduces currency risks, streamlines transactions, and avoids the high costs and delays of traditional bank transfers. It also enables faster international payments, giving SpaceX an edge in the fast-paced digital economy. Are Stablecoins the Answer? Palihapitiya believes stablecoins could transform cross-border transactions by replacing outdated banking systems and reducing high fees charged by traditional financial institutions. Stablecoin providers like Tether and Circle are now competing with payment giants such as MasterCard and American Express. Even lowering fees like the 3% charged by payment processors such as Stripe could make a significant impact on global economic growth. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Trump Names Stephen Miran as CEA Chair: A Boost for Crypto Markets? , Elon Musk’s Crypto Vision Elon Musk’s involvement in cryptocurrencies goes beyond SpaceX. Tesla’s Bitcoin investments have delivered strong returns, and Musk has introduced cryptocurrency tipping on his social media platform, X. Musk’s endorsement of stablecoins could further accelerate their adoption. Speculation is growing that Musk might advise Donald Trump in the White House, potentially creating a partnership between two major crypto supporters. This collaboration could drive interest in technologies like AI, stablecoins, and meme coins , making them attractive to large investors. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Musk the Manipulator (MUSKMANI), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKMANI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk the Manipulator can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk the Manipulator could become the next viral memecoin. Musk the Manipulator launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk the Manipulator on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk the Manipulator by entering its contract address – DZpfk5LaLrnP6vSFJnLSMAopUuTJGiFk7543rQxh4ids – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKMANI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/new-solana-memecoin-musk-the-manipulator-muskmani-will-skyrocket-14000-before-exchange-listing/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

There are a few economic reports due out this week despite it being a holiday period. However, they are unlikely to impact crypto markets. “We expect volatility from last week to carry over into early this week,” commented the Kobeissi Letter. Economic Events Dec. 23 to 27 Most of last week’s losses were due to the reaction to the news from the Federal Reserve’s meeting on Wednesday, in which it made the decision to reduce rates by 0.25%. However, the central bank’s “Dot Plot” revealed that policymakers expect only two interest rate cuts next year, not the four they had predicted in September. Additionally, Fed chair Jerome Powell anticipated higher core inflation in 2025 than was previously forecast, adding that the central bank is “going to be cautious about further cuts.” Monday will see December’s Consumer Confidence Index report, which conveys the level of consumer confidence in economic activity, impacting their spending, which contributes about 70% of GDP. Also related to spending is November’s Durable Goods Orders report, which is due on Tuesday. This data measures the cost of orders received by manufacturers for durable goods, such as vehicles and electrical appliances. The report helps assess the state of US production activity and reflects the demand for big-ticket goods, which is also related to consumer confidence and economic sentiment. Key Events This Week: 1. CB Consumer Confidence data – Monday 2. Durable Goods Orders data – Tuesday 3. November New Home Sales data – Tuesday 4. Markets Closed, Merry Christmas! – Wednesday 5. Initial Jobless Claims data – Thursday 6. Atlanta Fed GDPNow data – Thursday… — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) December 22, 2024 Initial jobless claims data will be released on Thursday, following the holiday on Wednesday, and GDP data from the Atlanta Fed will also be released on December 26. Crypto Market Outlook Crypto markets continued to decline over the weekend, with total capitalization falling to $3.4 trillion on Monday morning as around $200 billion left the space on Saturday and Sunday. The correction has wiped out all gains over the past month, sending markets back to late November levels. Bitcoin continues to pull back with a daily loss of 3%, sending it back below $94,000 during the Monday morning Asian trading session. The asset has now retreated 13% from its Dec. 17 all-time high of $108,000 and is heading back to support level in the low $90K range. Ethereum has tanked even harder, plummeting 20% from its high of over $4,000 last week to bottom out below $3,200 in late trading on Sunday. The altcoins were all in the red as the new week began with average losses between 2% and 4%.

Experts Even Predict a Potential 3x Growth in 2025,"The post Top Crypto Coins SOL and SHIB Facing Turbulence? Not This Rising Presale Star! Experts Even Predict a Potential 3x Growth in 2025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market is volatile, with tokens like Solana (SOL) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) showing some price dips. However, market analysts like Batman and Del Crxpto remain optimistic about these crypto coins with their price predictions. Amid all these developments, a new phase eight presale star has only gone up—IntelMarkets (INTL). Early buyers of this altcoin are already 710% richer, and it has raised nearly $5M. Interest in it is so high that many experts foresee a potential 3x surge for INTL in 2025. IntelMarkets (INTL) Price Rises 710%, More Upswings Ahead While Solana (SOL) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) are showing some red price charts, IntelMarkets (INTL) is bucking the trend. This crypto ICO event has already seen a 500% price surge. Since this presale is now in phase eight, its value will rise as this event advances. With nearly 4M INTL tokens sold, traders are excited about what this token will offer. Speaking of which, holding this altcoin will result in: Reduced Trading Fee: Up to 30% discounts on trading fees on the IntelMarkets platform. Governance Rights: The ability to give input on the upcoming developments for this platform. Prioritized Feature Rollout: INTL holders will get first dibs on new features or products from IntelMarkets. The IntelMarkets platform is also getting attention as it will combine AI technology and blockchain. It will introduce the first AI-powered smart trading platform with self-learning trading robots and more. In other words, IntelMarkets is strategically positioning itself to capitalize on the AI market, which Statista predicts may be worth $826B by 2030. Traders interested in this platform’s growth potential are now buying the INTL token . It costs only $0.073, a 710% rise from its starting price. However, this altcoin price will rise to $0.082 after phase nine of the presale starts. In fact, a Tier-1 CEX listing is expected to trigger a rally to $0.11, potentially making INTL one of the best altcoins for fast returns. Solana (SOL) Price Dips, but Analyst Remains Bullish Solana (SOL) is among the best cryptos but has seen some red price charts. According to CoinMarketCap, its value fell over 20% in the past month alone. The Solana price moved between $240 and below $180 during that time. However, crypto analyst Batman remains optimistic for Solana (SOL). In a recent X post, he said that now is the ideal time to start scaling into crypto coins like SOL. As a Solana price prediction, he predicts a potential surge past $240. Although the Solana coin may see a price surge again, experts think it may not be as high as expected. As its price has increased nearly 150% in the past year, the highest upswings may have come and passed. Del Crxpto: A Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price of $0.01 May Come As one of the biggest meme coins, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen a lackluster performance recently. On the one-week chart, the price of Shiba Inu has fallen nearly 30% as per CoinMarketCap. Right now, traders are paying attention to market expert Del Crxpto. According to his X post, the dream of Shiba Inu (SHIB) hitting the $0.01 level may become a reality now. Therefore, investors are excited about this Shiba Inu price prediction. However, the Shiba Inu market cap now stands at $11B, which could slow down its growth. To clarify, this meme coin will need more money for its price to skyrocket. Meanwhile, tokens like IntelMarkets will not have this problem. Can IntelMarkets (INTL) Surge Ahead of Solana (SOL) & Shiba Inu (SHIB)? While Solana (SOL) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) face some challenges, IntelMarkets (INTL) is riding a bullish wave. This newcomer will bring innovation, real-world utility, and more. Plus, its low market cap means that this altcoin will need less money for its price to rise. Therefore, experts foresee a potential surge of 3x for INTL in 2025.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Pepeto is gaining traction as a standout meme coin, combining a compelling narrative with smart features, positioning itself as a key player in the evolving crypto landscape. Table of Contents Adverse market condition plunge Pepe price Why is Pepe Falling? Will Pepe rebound? Pepeto vs. rising meme coin stars How to join Pepeto About PEPETO After many days of celebrating a level above $100k, Bitcoin’s price has dropped. As the Fed’s recent declaration led to a token sell-off, the entire crypto market is trading in the red zone. Pepe, the world’s third-largest crypto by market capitalization, has dropped by more than 16% in a month, with the majority of the drop occurring since last week. Will Pepe make a comeback, or should investors start to focus on alternative investments? Adverse market condition plunge Pepe price While the third quarter of 2024 proved beneficial for the crypto market, especially since Bitcoin’s surge past the $100k mark pushed other meme coins such as Pepe to new highs, in the last few days, Pepe has started to trade in the red. Since December 9th, the Pepe price has fallen by more than 43%. It is currently trading around the $0.000016 level and has a market capitalization of more than $7.11 billion. Why is Pepe Falling? Pepe’s recent fall has been the result of adverse market conditions, triggered by the Fed’s outlook for fewer rate cuts in 2025. Another reason behind the market’s downward trend was Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve’s Chair, dispelling any rumors of a potential Bitcoin reserve. “We’re not allowed to own Bitcoin,” Powell said following the Fed’s two-day policy meeting, which highlighted that the US Central Bank has no intention of being involved in any government efforts to stockpile large amounts of Bitcoin. This dropped the BTC price, creating a chain reaction that adversely impacted the broader crypto space. Pepe’s price is a victim of this drop. Will Pepe rebound? Pepe’s recent drop has been very steep, with three large red candles forming recently. The RSI indicator shows that it is getting closer to the oversold zone (currently at 37). The MACD histogram has also painted a long red, indicating that a further drop may be coming soon. The critical support for the token right now is around the $0.000006 level. Once the Pepe price reaches there, there is a possibility of a rebound. Now, whether or not the token is able to recapture its recent high will depend on the community’s strength and broader market conditions. Pepeto vs. rising meme coin stars The rise of Pepeto mirrors the success of other standout memecoins like Pepe Unchained (PEPU), which secured $73 million during its presale and delivered over 171% gains post-listing, and CatSlap (SLAP), which rewarded early investors with an impressive 3,450% return. However, Pepeto distinguishes itself with a strategic and visionary approach. Known as the God of Frogs, Pepeto carves a unique path in the meme coin world with a narrative that goes beyond typical hype.

Justin Sun’s $143M Sell-Off Triggers Panic appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ethereum is having a rough week, and the crypto market is feeling the strain. Adding to the drama is Tron founder Justin Sun, who has been making waves with some massive Ethereum transactions. Over the past week, Sun sold $143 million worth of ETH—about half of his holdings—triggering a sharp price drop. The community is buzzing with questions: Why is he offloading so much ETH? Is there a hidden agenda behind these moves? Let’s unravel the factors driving Ethereum’s slide and see what lies ahead. Justin Sun’s Massive ETH Transactions Since November 10, Justin Sun has deposited 108,919 ETH—worth around $400 million—into HTX (formerly Huobi), according to blockchain data from Spot On Chain . Most of these deposits happened when Ethereum’s price was near its recent highs, averaging $3,674 per ETH. Source : Spot on chain In addition, Sun recently unstaked 42,904 ETH from Lido Finance , valued at $139 million. There’s speculation he may move these funds to HTX as well. Such large transactions are putting pressure on Ethereum’s price , and the market is feeling the heat. Ethereum’s Price Takes a Hit Ethereum is now trading at $3,304, down 17% from its recent rejection at $4,000. In the last 24 hours, it has dropped another 2.19%, and trading volume is down 8.57%. Source : Coinglass The market sentiment isn’t great either. Data shows that 54% of futures trades are short positions, with the long-short ratio at 0.8495. However, there’s a small silver lining: 78% of Ethereum holders are still in profit at the current price. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why is the Bitcoin (BTC) Price Dropping? Is This Something to Worry About? , Key Technical Levels to Watch Ethereum is approaching a crucial support level at $3,260. If it breaks below this level, the price could drop further to $3,000, where the 200-day moving average might provide some support. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 39.28, near oversold territory, while the Average Directional Index (ADX) indicates strong bearish momentum. These signals suggest Ethereum’s price could remain under pressure in the short term. What’s Next for Ethereum? The big question is whether Ethereum can hold above $3,260. If not, analysts warn the price could fall as low as $2,800, especially if large holders like Justin Sun continue selling. While some experts think Ethereum is still in a “safe zone,” others caution that low weekend trading volumes and uncertainty in the stock market could lead to more volatility. Justin Sun’s large Ethereum transactions have added pressure to an already weak market, leading to speculation about his motives. For now, investors should stay cautious and keep an eye on key support levels and whale movements as the market remains volatile. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

37995961,https://coinpedia.org/?p=396369,1734938819,Make $1 Million in the Crypto Bull Run 2025 – Top Investor Reveals Strategy!,"The post Make $1 Million in the Crypto Bull Run 2025 – Top Investor Reveals Strategy! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Many believe 2025 could be an interesting (and successful) year for the cryptocurrency industry, with bold predictions and strategic moves shaping the market. Rumors suggest that top crypto investors are crafting aggressive plans to capitalize on anticipated market gains. Among them, VirtualBacon, a renowned investor on X, has unveiled his ambitious strategy to achieve $1 million in profits next year. Let’s explore his approach and its potential impact. Building on 2024’s Market Momentum VirtualBacon’s investment strategy leverages the positive trends from 2024, a year marked by Bitcoin and Ethereum Spot ETF approvals that boosted market sentiment. He pointed out that the altcoin market has moved past its consolidation phase and appears set to outperform Bitcoin, paving the way for a possible altseason in 2025. To align with these trends, he reduced his Bitcoin allocation from 20% to 10%, while retaining 20% exposure each to Ethereum and Solana . These three cryptocurrencies form the foundation of his portfolio, reflecting his confidence in their resilience and growth potential. Targeting Six Core Categories VirtualBacon’s strategy is heavily focused on altcoins, with investments spread across six main categories: Layer 1, Layer 2, Gaming, AI, Real World Assets (RWA), and Decentralized Finance (DeFi). Is the 2025 crypto bull run your opportunity to 10x? #Bitcoin is hitting new all-time highs, altcoins are catching fire, and the Federal Reserve’s money printer is poised to return. This could be the biggest year in crypto history. Here’s how I’m building my $1M crypto… — VirtualBacon (@VirtualBacon0x) December 22, 2024 Crypto Investor’s Layer 1 & Layer 2 Top Picks For Layer 1 assets, his portfolio includes Avalanche, Toncoin, Kaspa, Aptos, Sei, and Algorand. He cited Avalanche’s strong gaming, RWA, and DeFi ecosystem; Toncoin’s reliable infrastructure; and Algorand’s standout tokenomics as key reasons for these picks. In Layer 2, VirtualBacon invested in Metis and Mantle. He praised Metis for its innovations in memecoins, gaming, and AI, and highlighted Mantle’s robust support from Bybit. Gaming Altcoins Take the Spotlight Gaming altcoins represent the largest portion of VirtualBacon’s portfolio, underscoring his belief in their growth potential. His picks include Superverse, Beam, Zentry, Wilder World, XBorg, Seedworld, Super Champs, Play Network, and Sidus. These choices are based on their infrastructure, scalability, and innovation. AI and RWA Picks In the AI category, his selections feature Near Protocol, Bittensor, Arweave, HumansAI, AIOZ Network, BasedAI, Paal AI, and Nosana. Reasons for these choices include NEAR’s scalability, TAO’s strong tokenomics, Arweave’s focus on decentralized computing, and Nosana’s Solana-based compute network. For RWA, he chose Axelar and Clearpool, citing Axelar’s interoperability and Clearpool’s institutional support as major advantages. DeFI and Memecoins: What We Know About The Investor’s Choice In DeFi, VirtualBacon invested in Wrapped Ampleforth, SwissBorg, and mETH Protocol. He noted WAMPL’s dominance in the rebasing token niche and SwissBorg’s high total value locked (TVL) relative to its valuation. Memecoins also hold a notable place in his portfolio. His picks—PEPE, MOG, BRETT, WIF, GOAT, PUFF, FOXY, and M3M3—were chosen for reasons ranging from PEPE’s strong community backing and cultural relevance to GOAT’s unique positioning as an AI agent-powered memecoin. What A Smart Investor’s Portfolio Looks Like VirtualBacon’s portfolio distribution reflects his methodical approach to risk and opportunity: Bitcoin : 10% Ethereum : 20% Solana : 20% Gaming : 16.4% AI : 10.9% Memecoins : 7% Layer 1 & Layer 2 : 9% RWA : 3.1% DeFi : 3.7% To navigate the volatile crypto market, he adheres to three core principles: avoiding overleveraging, focusing on high-conviction sectors, and maintaining a well-defined exit strategy. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The crowd has gone into a full Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) state, which could actually be beneficial for bitcoin’s upcoming price movements. Bitcoin/Price/Chart 23.12.2024. Source: TradingView Crowd Hints at Recovery? Just six days ago, the primary cryptocurrency was flying high above $100,000 and ever skyrocketed to its latest all-time high of just over $108,000. This put the gains following Trump’s victory at roughly 60%. However, the landscape changed on Wednesday after the hawkish comments by Fed Chair Jerome Powell about fewer interest rate cuts for 2025. In what turned out to be the worst trading week for BTC since Trump’s win, the cryptocurrency dropped by 15% from the aforementioned peak to $92,000. Although it has managed to recover some ground, it still fails to bounce off in a manner similar to the previous corrections and is currently struggling to remain above $95,000. According to the crypto analytics platform Santiment, this extended correction has made the crowd fearful as the overall sentiment was sent “down to its most negative statistical point of the year.” However, this could be a blessing in disguise for BTC as the asset tends to move in the opposite direction of retail investors’ expectations, said the report. BREAKING: Crypto’s further flush has sent Bitcoin’s crowd sentiment down to its most negative statistical point of the year. Vocal traders are now showing severe FUD, and that’s good news for contrarians who know markets move the opposite direction of retail’s expectations. https://t.co/lYvTWbRX25 pic.twitter.com/AfhVJwRHlj — Santiment (@santimentfeed) December 22, 2024 BTC Buy Signal? Crypto analyst Ali Martinez outlined a potential ‘buy signal’ for BTC after the correction due to the TD sequential on the 4-hour chart. The indicator identifies the exhaustion in either direction and typically pinpoints the beginning of a reversal. The TD Sequential presents a buy signal on the #Bitcoin $BTC 4-hour chart, anticipating a price rebound! pic.twitter.com/acDIusZCkW — Ali (@ali_charts) December 22, 2024 Martinez further brought up a key support zone for bitcoin that can send the asset soaring once again. However, if broken to the downside, BTC could tumble hard to around $70,000 as there’s not much support between here and there. The cryptocurrency currently sits at the lower end of the crucial support, which extends from $97,041 to $93,806. In fact, the asset slipped below the latter during the night but managed to bounce off, at least for now. The key support zone for #Bitcoin $BTC now lies between $97,041 and $93,806. If this critical demand area doesn’t hold, we could see a sharp drop to $70,085, as there’s minimal support below. pic.twitter.com/cHdr5mKxhi — Ali (@ali_charts) December 22, 2024 The post Bitcoin’s 15% Weekly Drop Results in Massive FUD: Here’s Why That’s Good News appeared first on CryptoPotato .",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Crypto Potato,https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoins-15-weekly-drop-results-in-massive-fud-heres-why-thats-good-news/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/37995796.jpeg

This rise highlights the growing interest in privacy-focused cryptocurrencies. Verge XVG Coin Recored Massive Gain As of now, Verge ( XVG ) has been gaining significant momentum, currently trading at around $0.013. While it has seen a slight dip from its earlier peak, the token still boasts a 27% increase in the past 24 hours, showcasing its resilience. Over the past month, XVG’s price has surged by 90.7%, adding an average of $0.00034 to its value. This steady growth highlights its strengthening position in the crypto market. Additionally, with an impressive year-to-date (YTD) growth of 238%, XVG’s market cap now stands at slightly above $215 million. What Makes Verge Stand Out? Verge is a decentralized blockchain that focuses on privacy and anonymity. It improves on Bitcoin’s original blockchain by adding privacy tools like Tor integration and VergePay, which lets users send funds to stealth addresses. Originally launched in 2014 as DogeCoinDark, Verge was rebranded in 2016 to better align with its goals. It uses Simple Payment Verification (SPV) technology for faster transactions and competes with other privacy-focused coins like Monero and Zcash. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Cardano Offering an Optimal Entry Point—Is ADA Primed to Rally Higher in Coming Weeks? , XVG Price Prediction According to Coinpedia’s predictions , XVG could reach $0.0149 by the end of 2024 if its bullish momentum continues.

With its robust performance and focus on privacy, Verge is gaining momentum as a noteworthy contender in the evolving crypto market.

Analysts Answered!,"As is known, although the FED cut the interest rate by 25 basis points last week in line with expectations, FED Chairman Jerome Powell made hawkish statements. Following these statements, Bitcoin (BTC) experienced a sharp decline to $92,000 levels, recording its first weekly loss since Donald Trump's US election victory. Bitcoin has fallen more than 7% in a week, suffering its first weekly loss since Donald Trump won the US presidential election, Bloomberg reported. This is the sharpest decline since September, driven by the cautious Fed stance that has cooled enthusiasm for Trump’s cryptocurrency-friendly stance. The Fed made its third consecutive rate cut on Wednesday, but Powell signaled that monetary easing, or rate cuts, would be slower next year to keep inflation under control, sending global stocks into a downward spiral. The decline in stocks also had a negative impact on the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency markets, while Powell's hawkish stance and his statement that he would not agree with Trump's promise of a national Bitcoin reserve deepened the decline even further. Evaluating the decline in Bitcoin and the latest situation, liquidity provider Arbelos Markets analyst Sean McNulty stated that the record outflow in US spot Bitcoin ETFs last week could lower prices even further in the short term. “We need to maintain the $90,000 level for Bitcoin until the end of the year for further upside, but if we fall below that level we could trigger further liquidation. “In the past week, options traders have also been hedging to the downside. At this point, we see big buyers at the $75,000 to $80,000 hits in January, February and March.” FalconX head of research David Lawant said there will be a major bull run in the first quarter of 2025, but prices will remain volatile in the short term before then. “As we enter the final days of the year, the low liquidity environment could lead to more volatility, especially with cryptocurrencies set to see the largest option expiration in history on December 27,” Lawant said. *This is not investment advice.

37996447,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52915,1734938208,XRP The Big Fall: Analyst Says It Already Began At This Dollar Mark,"EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto), a prominent cryptocurrency analyst on X, recently shared an intriguing chart and commentary on XRP’s price trajectory. The analysis, initially suggesting a big fall for XRP, is revealed upon closer examination to project a significant upward movement for XRP, with potential targets aligning with Fibonacci retracement levels. The chart shared by EGRAG CRYPTO appears visually inverted, which might be misleading at first glance. However, a closer look makes the bullish sentiment clear. The analyst identified three key levels derived from Fibonacci extensions, a common tool in financial market analysis to identify potential price targets after a breakout, and an analysis of the asset’s extended consolidation and repetition of historic patterns. #XRP – The Big Fall: It has already began At $2 Dollar Mark. Soon I'll be welcoming you in Valhalla. #XRPFamily STAY STEADY and STRONG pic.twitter.com/1PPh1jgyS0 — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) December 22, 2024 Targets for XRP’s Next Run EGRAG CRYPTO noted the $2 mark as the beginning of XRP’s journey. In early December, the digital asset crossed over the $2 level for the first time since 2018, and EGRAG CRYPTO believes the asset has entered a new phase. The first target is $5.89, a level the analyst has previously described as a measured move preceding a pump to double digits . Notably, this target represents a new all-time high for XRP. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The digital asset is currently trading at $2.2, and this target represents a 167.7% increase from its current price. However, this is just the start, as EGRAG CRYPTO has much higher expectations for the digital asset. The second target is $15, a massive 581.8% increase that significantly exceeds XRP’s previous all-time highs. This prediction signals a potential for strong market adoption or major developments in the cryptocurrency space. The final target is $18.5, which is 740.9% higher than the asset’s current price, and would bring life-changing wealth to early investors. The Increasing Bullish Sentiment Surrounding XRP EGRAG CRYPTO’s analysis has sparked excitement within the XRP community. His analysis reflects a broader trend in the cryptocurrency market, as many analysts have recently shared bullish predictions for XRP. The identification of Fibonacci-based targets at $5.89, $15.00, and $18.50 reinforces this bullish outlook for XRP. While the asset has a strong technical foundation, notable developments within the crypto space like the recent launch of RLUSD and growing adoption through Ripple’s global partnerships could speed up this predicted rally.

Well, it’s not just the meme potential—it’s the community-driven initiatives, including a play-to-earn (P2E) game, staking rewards, and referral programs . These features help BTFD create more than just a speculative coin; it’s building an entire ecosystem that rewards loyal holders. Let’s take a moment to appreciate BTFD Coin’s explosive growth.

If you’re looking for a fun yet promising investment, Dogwifhat might just be the coin for you. Snek: A Meme Coin That’s Redefining Gaming and Cryptocurrency When talking about the best new meme coins to invest in this week, Snek is definitely turning heads.

By combining the best elements of meme coins and the gaming industry, Snek has created a unique niche that’s capturing the attention of both gamers and crypto investors alike. Snek’s commitment to gaming isn’t just a marketing gimmick—it’s built into the coin’s very foundation. The project plans to integrate with major gaming platforms, allowing players to use Snek for in-game purchases, rewards, and other virtual assets. Imagine using your meme coin to buy skins, items, or unlock exclusive content in your favourite games. Snek has already made moves in this direction, and it’s only going to grow from here.

Metaplanet, a publicly traded Japanese company, has acquired 619.7 Bitcoin as part of its crypto treasury strategy, paying an average of 15,330,073 yen per ( BTC ), with a total investment of 9.5 billion yen. *Metaplanet purchases additional 619.70 BTC* pic.twitter.com/5npflMJ3kW — Metaplanet Inc.

The company has spent 20.872 billion yen in total on Bitcoin acquisitions, the document reads. The latest purchase is the largest so far for the Tokyo-headquartered company and comes just days after Metaplanet issued its 5th Series of Ordinary Bonds via private placement with EVO FUND, raising 5 billion yen (approximately $32 million). The proceeds from this issuance, as disclosed earlier, were allocated specifically for purchasing Bitcoin. These bonds, set to mature in June 2025, carry no interest and allow for early redemption under specific conditions.

From Oct. 1 to Dec. 23, Metaplanet’s BTC Yield surged to 309.82%, up from 41.7% in the previous quarter. Bitcoin itself has seen strong performance this year, climbing 120% and outperforming assets like the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 indices. However, it has recently pulled back from its all-time high of $108,427, trading at $97,000 after the Federal Reserve indicated only two interest rate cuts in 2025. Despite the retreat, on-chain metrics indicate that Bitcoin is still undervalued based on its Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV-Z) score, which stands at 2.84 — below the threshold of 3.7 that historically signals an asset is overvalued.

37995565,https://coinpedia.org/?p=396353,1734937944,"While Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Cardano (ADA) Plunges, Analysts Reveal Why DTX Exchange (DTX) Is Making Higher Highs","The post While Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Cardano (ADA) Plunges, Analysts Reveal Why DTX Exchange (DTX) Is Making Higher Highs appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News While Shiba Inu (SHIB) is trying to get positive momentum and Cardano (ADA) is struggling with consolidation, DTX Exchange (DTX) is making higher highs . Given early DTX investors are currently enjoying over 440% gains, this new crypto is quickly flipping the portfolios of investors. Analysts estimate enormous gains for DTX, with up to 100x rallies post-launch, while Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Cardano (ADA) holders remain optimistic for a bullish continuation. Read on to discover why DTX Exchange is positioned to be the best crypto investment of this bull cycle. DTX Exchange (DTX) Promises Explosive Returns for All Investors By guaranteeing a fair and democratized token distribution method that levels the playing field for both retail and institutional investors, DTX Exchange is enhancing crypto investment. As a result, DTX Exchange removes the power of venture capitalists and whales by offering equal opportunity to all. Through its creative cliff pricing strategy, DTX encourages early involvement. While governance tokens empower token holders with a role in determining the future of the platform, token holders also gain from the earnings of the platform as well as from trade discounts. DTX holders tend to make substantial passive income because of this investor-centric approach. Meanwhile, DTX also gives access to over 120,000 financial assets including currencies, stocks, and cryptocurrencies. Supported by the robust VulcanX blockchain, DTX Exchange presents an unmatched trading experience distinguished by security, speed, and efficiency. Early DTX investors have already witnessed returns exceeding 440% as the current token price is just $0.12 in its sixth ICO round. Meanwhile, DTX is expected to get listed at $0.20 on key exchanges like Uniswap, Binance, and Bybit in Q1 2025. DTX is set for exponential growth as projections show up to 100x gains after its debut, making it the best crypto investment right now. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Consolidates Extensively The Shiba Inu price has lately gone through a phase of consolidation as it swings between $0.000030 and $0.000026 before falling to the main $0.000020 support level. Long-term hope is still intact even as the weekly Shiba Inu price chart shows a bearish pattern of lower highs and lower lows suggesting that bears are under control for now. Higher highs and higher lows on the annual Shiba Inu price chart point to the possibility of growing momentum. Although some may find the current Shiba Inu price action pessimistic, analysts are hopeful that the altcoin may rise toward its all-time high of $0.000088 soon, offering investors hope for a significant comeback. For those looking for even more exponential gains, DTX offers a more promising substitute nonetheless. Despite being one of the promising altcoins to watch, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has a market capitalization of about $11 billion, but DTX has far more room to skyrocket with a market capitalization of just $57 million. DTX is fast attracting attention as it gets set for its official launch in Q1 2025. Meanwhile, DTX has already yielded an amazing 440% ROI in just a few months during its presale phase. According to analysts, there could be up to 100x rallies post-launch, making DTX the best crypto investment right now. Bullish Sentiment Remains as Cardano (ADA) Eyes Potential ATH Retest The Cardano price has shown some volatility recently; last week the price dropped more than 22%, yet over the past month it rose by almost 4%. The Cardano price has primarily been consolidating between $1.35 and $0.74, but the community sentiment is still very positive and many see a possible bullish breakout soon. While the Momentum Oscillator advises prudence with its sell signals, technical indicators such as the MACD and Moving Averages are showing buy signals on the Cardano price chart, therefore boosting investor confidence. Though the Cardano price chart shows that the altcoin is trading more than 70% below its ATH of $3.10, analysts remain hopeful, predicting that the altcoin might retest its ATH in this bull run. Cardano (ADA) is among the altcoins to watch over the next few months as long-term investors are hoping for a great rally. Although Cardano’s (ADA) future seems promising, DTX offers a far larger chance for exponential increase. DTX gives investors much more opportunity for big ROIs than Cardano (ADA), with a market valuation of just about $57 million, compared to Cardano’s (ADA) $29 billion. DTX’s small market cap will make it much easier for the token to skyrocket in value. DTX Exchange Promises More Gains Than Shiba Inu and Cardano While Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Cardano (ADA) face bearish pressure, DTX Exchange (DTX) is yielding big gains for holders. DTX is revolutionizing the crypto investing scene with its fair token distribution, modern VulcanX blockchain, and more than 440% ROI within a few months during its presale. This is an opportunity too great to overlook with DTX’s small market cap and ambitious rally forecasts of up to 100x post-launch.

Dubbed the “Crypto Council,” Hines will work alongside tech entrepreneur and Artificial Intelligence and Crypto Czar David Sacks to create a regulatory framework for the digital assets sector, as confirmed by Trump in a Dec. 22 Truth Social post . Appointed last month as Trump’s AI and Crypto Czar, David Sacks will spearhead the newly formed crypto council, tasked with shaping digital asset policies, collaborating with Congress on regulatory frameworks, establishing a Bitcoin reserve, and coordinating efforts with key agencies like the SEC, CFTC, and the Treasury. Sacks and Hines—both seen as staunch advocates for the crypto industry—are expected to drive innovation, create growth opportunities, and ensure industry leaders have the tools needed to thrive in an evolving digital economy, Trump wrote, adding: “Together, they will create an environment where this industry can flourish and remain a cornerstone of our Nation’s technological advancement.” You might also like: Crypto firms vying for a place on Trump’s ‘Crypto Council’: report In a Dec. 23 X post , Hines expressed his enthusiasm for taking up the new role, calling it an “honor of a lifetime.” The crypto community has largely welcomed Hines’ appointment with optimism, viewing it as a positive step toward regulatory clarity and industry growth. Prominent figures, including MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor and Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson, have publicly congratulated Hines. See below. Congratulations, Bo. It's a tough job, but you're up for it — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) December 23, 2024 Hines ran for the House this year in North Carolina’s 6th District but fell short in the Republican primaries, placing fourth among the candidates. In his previous bid in 2022, Hines ran for North Carolina’s 13th District but narrowly lost to Democrat Wiley Nickel in the general election. The former football player has also received backing from influential pro-crypto political action committees, including the American Dream Federal Action super PAC. Additionally, during his 2022 congressional campaign, he was supported by former FTX executive Ryan Salame, who is currently serving time for campaign finance violations. Hines’ appointment reflects Trump’s ongoing strategy of surrounding himself with pro-crypto allies as he builds his new administration. This approach aligns with his earlier nomination of former SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins, a well-known advocate for clearer crypto regulations, to replace outgoing SEC Chair Gary Gensler, whose tenure has been marked by regulatory uncertainty, frequent lawsuits, and aggressive enforcement actions against the crypto industry.

42389227,4849edca-a4ad-429f-a0aa-c4c583f516ee,1734937334,"More Pain Likely, Market Expert Says After Bitcoin's Biggest Loss Since August","Bitwise's Europe head of research, who has been accurately bullish on bitcoin (BTC) for months, has turned cautious after last week's 8% dip, warning of deeper losses in the coming weeks.  Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, fell 8.8% to nearly $95,000 last week, the biggest percentage drop since August, according to data source TradingView and CoinDesk Indices. The losses came as the Federal Reserve signaled fewer rate cuts for next year while stressing that it prohibited from holding BTC and doesn't seek a change in the law to do so.  The so-called hawkish rate projections also roiled sentiment in traditional markets, leading to a 2% drop in the S&P 500 and a 0.8% gain in the dollar index, lifting it to the highest since October 2022. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, the so-called risk-free rate, rose 14 basis points, breaking out bullishly from a technical pattern.  The risk-off mood may persist for some time, according to Andre Dragosch, director and head of research Europe at Bitwise.  ""The big macro picture is that the Fed is stuck between a rock and a hard place as financial conditions have continued to tighten despite 3 consecutive rate cuts since September. Meanwhile, real-time measures of consumer price inflation have re-accelerated over the past months to new highs as well judging by truflation‘s indicator for U.S. inflation,"" Dragosch told CoinDesk.  Dragosch is one of the few observers who correctly predicted a massive BTC price rally in late July when the sentiment was hardly bullish. BTC put in lows near $50,000 around that time and recently topped $100,000 for the first time on record.  ""So, it’s quite likely that we will see more pain in the coming weeks, but this could be an interesting buying opportunity given the ongoing tailwinds provided by the BTC supply deficit,"" Dragosch added.  The hardening of the Treasury yields, representing higher borrowing costs and relative attractiveness of fixed-income investments, typically leads to outflow from riskier assets like cryptocurrencies and stocks. A stronger dollar also makes USD-based assets expensive, discouraging capital inflows.  Inflation following the 1970s model?  If you have been following financial markets for a while, you have likely encountered discussions that price pressures in the U.S. economy are on the same inflation rollercoaster ride as the 1970s. Back then, the second wave was more intense than the first.  Dragosch notes that the sticky CPI inflation readings in recent months have raised concerns at the Fed about a potential second wave, leading to a more cautious stance on rate cuts.  ""They are probably scared of the double hump scenario and a revival of the 70s twin peak in inflation which is why they are probably too reluctant to cut rates more aggressively,"" Dragosch said. ""They risk a significant acceleration in inflation if they cut rates aggressively, if they do little, the economy may suffer.""

The asset hit an intraday low of $93,810 during trading in Asia on Monday morning but recovered quickly to tap $96,000 before another slip. Those losses have resulted in a “bearish engulfing” weekly candle, as reported by crypto analyst “Rekt Capital.” All of the gains over the past month have now been wiped out in the correction. “Bitcoin is showing increasing signs of transitioning into a multi-week correction,” he said. #BTC Bitcoin has confirmed a Bearish Engulfing candlestick formation $BTC #Crypto #Bitcoin https://t.co/KnIptVe958 pic.twitter.com/XwUWCkjTvM — Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) December 23, 2024 Bitcoin Corrections Are Normal “Historically, week eight in Bitcoin price discovery tends to be a corrective week,” the analyst added while providing a comparison with previous market cycles. In 2017, week nine was also corrective, but to a much lesser extent than week eight, he observed, before adding : “Generally, once BTC clears the typically corrective weeks 7 and 8 – the retrace gets close to a bottom.” It is also the worst week for the asset since Donald Trump won the US presidential election in early November. Additionally, the Federal Reserve’s cautious policy outlook has tempered optimism over Trump’s embrace of the crypto sector. Nevertheless, BTC remains up more than 40% since Trump’s victory. “We should hold the $90,000 level for Bitcoin into the year-end, but if we break below that could trigger further liquidations,” Sean McNulty, director of trading at liquidity provider Arbelos Markets, told Bloomberg. Meanwhile, David Lawant, head of research at crypto prime broker FalconX, said the “low-liquidity environment may bring more volatility as we enter into the final days of the year.” He pointed out that Dec. 27 will also likely see the biggest crypto options expiry event of its history, with almost $18 billion in notional value BTC and ETH contracts expiring. Additionally, spot Bitcoin ETFs shed almost $950 million on Thursday and Friday as investors were rattled by the market pullback. Some Altcoins Showing Recovery There are a handful of altcoins showing minor bounces from their correction dips this Monday morning. Solana (SOL) made 2.2% on the day to reach $186, Chainlink (LINK) was up 5.1%, topping $23, Toncoin (TON) made 3.5% to reach $5.50, and Stellar (XLM) was up 3%, trading at $0.363 at the time of writing.

Trump Fires Powell (TRUMPPOW), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPOW is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Fires Powell can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Fires Powell could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Fires Powell launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Fires Powell on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Fires Powell by entering its contract address – FWmVybuoRxJ79ZDHJ3Y8efeYsHsKL4qMNwJP8rCDsfmB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPOW. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trump-fires-powell-trumppow-solana-memecoin-will-surge-15000-before-first-exchange-listing-while-pepe-shib-and-wif-fall/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png
37994903,https://coinpedia.org/?p=396333,1734936390,"Web3 Is The Future For High-Net-Worth Individuals, But Can They Trust It?","The post Web3 Is The Future For High-Net-Worth Individuals, But Can They Trust It? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Web3 can provide many benefits to high-net-worth individuals, with new and exciting opportunities for them to manage and grow their wealth. Through exposure to cryptocurrencies, NFTs and tokenized assets like art and real estate, individuals can dramatically diversify their investment portfolios and access new and exciting markets. With decentralized finance, investors can engage in staking, lending and liquidity provisioning, and potentially benefit from some attractive yields that are difficult to find in traditional finance. Anyone who is familiar with Web3 will know that it can provide enhanced financial flexibility within more dynamic and decentralized economies. But at the same time, most of those with significant funds available are cautious about increasing their exposure to digital assets. There are good reasons for this caution, as the Web3 industry’s regulatory status remains incredibly cloudy, and security is still a big question mark. It’s clear that some Web3 platforms are trustworthy, but there are many which are not, and even many of the honest DeFi protocols can still fall victim to glaring vulnerabilities in their underlying code. Still, that doesn’t mean that high-net-worth individuals should avoid investing in Web3 entirely, it just means they have to proceed with extra caution. They need to do their homework and identify legitimate platforms that have invested in strong security and worked hard to ensure compliance with global anti-money laundering and know-your-customer rules. In addition, they can focus their efforts on platforms that have achieved compliance with financial authorities in key crypto markets, such as Dubai, Singapore and Switzerland, which have already created specific regulations with Web3 in mind. Strong encryption is a must The most reliable digital asset platforms are those that use strong encryption to secure user’s personal information and encrypt as much data as it’s possible to do. Some of the most reliable cryptographic security standards include biometric and homomorphic encryption, which can mask user’s transaction details from outsiders, while multiparty computation can offer further reassurances. Biometric security uses details such as the user’s facial scan, eye scan, fingerprints or even their voice as a kind of cryptographic key that’s required to access their accounts. Such techniques go a long way towards preventing unauthorized account access. Meanwhile, homomorphic encryption is a technique that allows data to be processed without ever decrypting it, meaning that it’s never exposed to bad actors, even when it’s stolen in a breach. As for multiparty computation, this is a computing technique that splits work across multiple servers, ensuring that no single server has possession of all of the encrypted data at the same time, so even if one is hacked, the data that’s stolen is useless to whoever gains access to it. Regulatory compliance provides reassurance Affluent individuals must also consider the compliance status of Web3 platforms, as well as other indicators of their financial health, such as their funding sources, investor backing and profitability. These factors aren’t always very apparent, but one way to ensure a platform is legitimate is to consider what kind of financial certifications it has achieved. Certifications to look out for include the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority or FINMA, which is the independent regulatory body that governs financial institutions in Switzerland, including banks, investment companies and crypto exchanges. It’s known for its risk-based approach to supervision of such institutions, and it works to identify threats that might put such organizations at risk of financial crimes. It’s especially vigilant about money laundering and the finance of terrorism, and conducts regular audits and reviews of any certified institutions. Others include the Dubai Financial Services Authority or DFSA, which is the guardian of financial integrity within Dubai’s financial economy. It ensures that institutions ranging from banks to investment firms and crypto companies are in full compliance with Dubai’s stringent regulatory requirements, in adherence to its ethical standards, and maintain market integrity. Finally, a growing number of Web3 firms adhere to the regulations of the Monetary Authority of Singapore or MAS. Singapore has become a hotbed of crypto startups, and MAS does the job of regulating all such businesses in its territory. Web3’s advantage in wealth management If you can find a platform that’s regulated by all three of those organizations, you can be reassured that your finances are in safe hands, which is why the digital wealth management platform Welf stands out as a promising option for high-net-worth individuals. Welf, unlike traditional private banking services, operates 24/7, providing instant access to funds globally. Its products include tailored and exclusive investment opportunities, cash management, high-limit credit and debit cards that are accepted globally, luxury concierge services and advanced security. With it, clients can access a modern, fully-digital wealth management platform that blends traditional financial instruments with DeFi-based yield-generating opportunities and tokenized investments, expanding their financial opportunities. Welf’s native token WELF is required to access the platform, and sits at the heart of its ecosystem, as the main currency for transaction and service fees, and also as the cornerstone of its community governance mechanism. Clients are required to stake WELF tokens for access to its services and additional yield opportunities. The token is currently available via pre-sale IDOs on Polkastarter and Ape Terminal. Summing up Web3 is a vast and exciting financial ecosystem that has lots of potential for affluent individuals to diversify their portfolios and increase their wealth. However, it’s also a risky new economy that’s plagued by security concerns and scams, and that means regulatory compliance is a must for any serious investor. By achieving regulatory compliance, Web3 platforms demonstrate they’re committed to growing the decentralized finance system in a secure and ethical way, reassuring stakeholders, creating new opportunities for high-net-worth individuals.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | MARKET,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/information/web3-is-the-future-for-high-net-worth-individuals-but-can-they-trust-it/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Analyst Makes a Case Based On Repeating Bullish Pattern,"Dark Defender, a notable crypto analyst on X, recently shared a compelling technical analysis of XRP’s price trajectory. The post highlights a potential bullish movement using historical patterns and Fibonacci levels. The detailed chart compares a 4-hour timeframe correction to a similar structure forming on the daily timeframe, sparking discussions on XRP’s future price potential. According to Dark Defender, XRP’s previous correction on the 4-hour timeframe saw the cryptocurrency drop by 21% from $1.2680 to $1.0033. Following this correction, XRP consolidated within an ascending channel for a short period before a significant surge to $2.9070. This surge pushed XRP above $2 for the first time since 2018 and sent it to a multi-year high. What makes this prediction more intriguing, is that the asset shows the same pattern on the 1-day time frame. The comparison between the two timeframes suggests that an XRP break out is possible through key resistance levels, leading to substantial price increases. The asset has experienced a 34% drop, falling from that peak of $2.9070 to $1.9010, before a swift recovery and consolidation inside an upward channel. XRP imitates the 4-hour (4-H) correction structure on the daily time frame. After the 4-hour correction at that time, XRP ran from $1.2680 to $2.9070. With a daily break above $2.90, the Frog Leap first to the upper Fibonacci Level sits at $5.85 and $8.76 in the short term.… pic.twitter.com/iOeEz17drG — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) December 21, 2024 Targets For XRP’s Next Surge Dark Defender believes the current technical setup targets the Fibonacci levels at $5.85 and $8.76 in the short term. These projections indicate a potential rally that could more than double XRP’s current value of $2.19. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 A key aspect of the analysis is its focus on Fibonacci retracement and extension levels, a widely used tool in technical analysis. The Fibonacci levels referenced align with prior resistance zones and the analyst has previously referenced these targets . More Bullish Technical Indicators The lower portion of the chart highlights the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which is used to gauge market momentum. The 4-hour and daily charts indicate a cyclical pattern, with previous RSI behavior providing clues to future price movement. The RSI’s recovery following the correction in the 4-hour timeframe coincided with XRP’s strong rally, a pattern that appears to be unfolding on the daily chart. The detailed technical breakdown shared by Dark Defender outlines a potential roadmap for XRP’s price action. While the asset has shown some bearish momentum over the past 24 hours, his analysis and other bullish predictions shared by other analysts suggest this downturn will not last.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. How a Ripple millionaire’s windfall from XRP’s surge is inspiring interest in DTX Exchange, a new platform promising unprecedented growth potential. Table of Contents XRP’s meteoric rise makes investors look to DTX Exchange DTX set for unprecedented growth in 2025 Conclusion A Ripple millionaire reaped a seven-figure windfall from the recent XRP surge. This news will send shockwaves through the crypto community, reflecting the rapid pace at which the entire market is evolving. With this event, the Ripple millionaire paints a picture of how such a strategy can change lives. Analysts point at the beginning of November when the market was a little above $2 trillion, and now the whole market has increased above $3.5 trillion. The big-time Ripple investor became a millionaire after waiting for years for the XRP to go up to its current price. Given the success of this investment, interest in XRP and other rising coins has been revived. Now that the interest is rising even more in altcoins, there is a special one out there that is getting the most attention. The interest is in DTX Exchange (DTX) as an option for investment opportunities similar to the one in which the Ripple millionaire invested. XRP’s meteoric rise makes investors look to DTX Exchang e With the cryptocurrency reaching a 5-year high, XRP’s price has inspired new investors to start investing. Factors that caused this uptrend for XRP are: the bullish developments over Ripple’s ongoing court proceedings and, second, an increasing adoption of XRP for cross-border use cases. The million-dollar jackpot serves as food for thought to patient investors who invest wisely in cryptocurrencies. As the last moments of the recent XRP pump settle, the eyes are now on DTX Exchange , a hyped game-changer in the crypto community. DTX is using hybrid methodologies that perfectly combine the best features of centralized and decentralized exchanges. DTX Exchange is presently holding the sixth phase of the presale on its native token platform, with the current price of DTX tokens at $0.12, they have collected over $10.4 million in presale investments. Early backers who joined DTX early in the days when tokens were priced at $0.02 are already seeing profits of more than 500%. DTX holds enormous promise as savvy investors hail it as the next big investment opportunity. DTX set for unprecedented growth in 2025 Analysts and crypto fans have been discussing DTX Exchange’s raw growth potential. Some claim that DTX could have a significant rally. With an audacious prediction of 24,000% for the year 2025, analysts are comparing DTX to some of the incredibly successful platforms such as Binance and Uniswap. DTX is the first crypto-native platform that allows for seamless trade of stock, forex, ETF trading, and over 100,000 currency pairs in one go. Thus, the company can grab a huge portion of the online trading platform market, worth approximately $712 billion. Additionally, DTX Exchange offers features like up to 1000x leverage and a blistering transaction speed of 100,000 TPS, slowly becoming a strong contender in the world of finance. Conclusion For other investors who would like to mirror the success of the Ripple millionaire, then DTX Exchange is a great opportunity. The presale is currently moving very quickly, with an expected official launch next year in Q1 2025. DTX could very well be the next big crypto, providing early backers with life-changing returns.

With this aim, Trump announced Bo Hines, a former college football player, and 2022 Republican candidate, as the Executive Director of the Presidential Council of Advisers for Digital Assets, known as the “Crypto Council.” Trump in his social account announced that Hines will work along with David Sacks, Trump’s crypto czar, to drive innovation and growth in the digital assets space. The market is eyeing all the political moves as the coming month will be all a political month and policies will decide the fate of the crypto assets. To back his crypto love, Trump is working closely to make the U.S. the “world capital of crypto,”. The industry is cheering his big appointment plan to add Elon Musk and former SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins for key roles, hinting at friendlier rules to help the crypto industry grow with technological advancements.

Bitcoin has seen a massive bloodbath after the Fed’s hawkish comments. Since then it has taken a dip of 10% from its $108,300 peak, now trading near $95K. Moreover, the social sentiment has taken a toll to its lowest in 2024, with bears and negative rumors taking control of the crypto space. Despite this, Santiment sees this fear as an opportunity for a Bitcoin breakout. Historically, when there is low sentiment it often signals a price breakout, and many expect Bitcoin to regain momentum above $100,000 after Trump joins officially in January.

37994817,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52896,1734935404,Could Pepe Unchained Overtake The Original Pepe Coin? Is A New Altcoin Set To Outperform Both In 2025?,"While meme coins have cooled off slightly in Q4, they are likely to experience a major resurgence as soon as alt season commences around January-February. Set to traverse through its first bull run, Pepe is primed to rally following increasing whale activity and major exchange tier-1 exchange listings. As a leveraged bet to Pepe, Pepe Unchained also exhibits some potential but at a far greater risk. Read on to learn more about these assets. Whale Activity And Prominent Listings Bode Well For Pepe Before Alt Season Pepe has solidified its status as the third-largest memecoin in Q4, gaining traction through major listings on Coinbase, Robinhood, and Binance US. This has increased Pepe’s accessibility in the USA where the average person has more disposable income to frivolously spend on memes such as Pepe, which could be a major bullish catalyst for Pepe as the bull run progresses. In addition, recent whale activity has further fueled confidence for Pepe in the short-term. A dormant wallet recently transferred 2.1 trillion PEPE tokens, worth a staggering $52 million, after 600 days of inactivity. Given the insider information and aptitude that many whales possess, major moves like this have historically signified imminent bullish price action. Pepe’s rise is particularly notable given its historic performance during the bear market, where it defied expectations and delivered massive returns while other cryptocurrencies struggled. Although ultra-bullish predictions for Pepe like $0.10 or $1 are unrealistic due to market cap constraints, Pepe looks poised to become a top two meme in this cycle and usurp Shiba Inu as Ethereum’s primary meme mascot. Is It Worth Investing In Pepe Unchained? Pepe Unchained, a layer-2 meme coin designed to tackle Ethereum’s high fees and congestion, has performed decently in Q4, securing listings on MEXC and BingX during its presale. While the project boasts faster transactions and raised significant money so far, its reliance on layer-2 scaling raises concerns about its long-term sustainability on top of being a risky low cap meme play. Despite becoming one of the most swapped tokens on MetaMask and pushing a double-rewards staking feature, Pepe Unchained’s momentum remains tied to broader market sentiment and an anticipated “Pepe upsurge”. However, with Pepe already dominating the meme coin space, smaller projects like Pepe Unchained may struggle to sustain interest as new investors seek out “the real thing”. Analysts argue that Pepe Unchained’s features, including decentralized exchanges and cross-chain tools, are yet to demonstrate real adoption. As money inevitably trickles down to real utility gems with actual innovative fundamentals at the core of the project, the new financial cross-border payment coin Remittix could usurp Pepe Unchained as one of the trendiest presales for massive returns in this bull run. The Premier Presale Opportunity: Why Remittix Could Rally As Soon As Q1 2025 Remittix is revolutionizing global payments by seamlessly merging blockchain technology with fiat transfers, offering a faster and more cost-effective way to send money internationally. Users can send funds in over 40 cryptocurrencies, which are instantly converted into fiat currencies like USD, GBP, and EUR. With a transparent flat-fee model and no hidden charges, Remittix ensures that what users send is exactly what recipients receive, providing a reliable solution for both individuals and businesses navigating the complexities of cross-border payments. Another standout feature of Remittix is its ability to simplify international payroll processes. By allowing businesses to pay employees, freelancers, and contractors in cryptocurrency, which is automatically converted into fiat and deposited into bank accounts, Remittix removes the challenges associated with traditional systems like “Swift”. This innovation empowers companies to manage global teams with ease and reduce costs. At the heart of the Remittix ecosystem is the RTX token, currently available in its presale phase at $0.018. The token has been thoroughly audited by leading firms such as Solidproof and BlockSAFU, ensuring security and trust for early adopters. With a capped supply of 1.5 billion tokens and a growing demand for efficient cross-border payment solutions, RTX presents a unique investment opportunity during its tentative presale with 20x forecasts for the early stages of the bull run.

Depends on Your State’s Bill,"Retirement costs in the U.S. vary, from $700K to $2M, based on state and living expenses. To retire with $1M using SHIB, you need 45.4 billion tokens at its current price. SHIB’s price would need to rise 1,900% to hit $0.00044 for a $2M retirement goal. The amount of Shiba Inu (SHIB) needed to retire early depends on where you live in the United States. According to an analysis by GOBankingRates, as noted by a CNBC report , retirement expenses vary based on location, with some states requiring more than $1.36 million to cover costs for 25 years. Depending on the state, the U.S.’s retirement cost can range from $700,000 to over $2 million. GOBankingRates calculated the average cost of living for individuals aged 65 years or older in each state. For example, retirees in Hawaii require $2 million to manage 25 years of expenses, the highest sum among all U.S. states. But, those in West Virginia can retire comfortably with less than $700,000 for the same duration. These figures assume retirees are not included in Social Security benefits, which would add to personal savings.

On December 23, the company announced the $60 million acquisition of 619.7 BTC at an average price of approximately $96,000 per coin. The purchase marks a significant milestone for Metaplanet, nearly quadrupling its previous record buy of 159.7 BTC in October. Metaplanet Holds 1,762 BTC Dubbed “Asia’s MicroStrategy,” the Tokyo-based firm now holds a total of 1,762 BTC, valued at around $168 million, with an average purchase price of $75,600 per Bitcoin. The company reported a 310% BTC yield between October and December, a sharp increase from the 41.7% yield in the preceding quarter. Metaplanet views its Bitcoin acquisition strategy as a key value driver for shareholders. Looking ahead, the firm plans to expand its Bitcoin operations into a dedicated business line, incorporating loans, equity, and other instruments to support its BTC strategy. *Metaplanet purchases additional 619.70 BTC* pic.twitter.com/5npflMJ3kW — Metaplanet Inc. (@Metaplanet_JP) December 23, 2024 In November, Metaplanet announced a stock acquisition program aiming to raise $62 million for further Bitcoin purchases. Following the announcement, Metaplanet’s stock rose 5% on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, although it remains down 13% over the past week. For the year, shares have surged over 2,100%, driven by the firm’s aggressive Bitcoin adoption strategy. More recently, Metaplanet raised 9.5 billion yen ($60.6 million) through two tranches of bond issuance aimed at accelerating its Bitcoin purchases. Last week, the Tokyo-listed company announced it issued a 5 billion yen ($31.9 million) bond on Friday, following a 4.5 billion yen ($28.7 million) bond issuance earlier in the week. Both bonds are zero-interest and set to mature on June 16, 2025. According to Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich, the funds will allow the company to expedite its planned 2025 Bitcoin acquisitions into the current fiscal year. Metaplanet Anticipates First Operating Profit in Seven Years As reported, Metaplanet is poised to achieve its first consolidated operating profit in seven years, just months after incorporating Bitcoin into its balance sheet . The firm announced last week that it expects to generate 890 million Japanese yen ($5.8 million) in revenue for the fiscal year ending December 31, a significant increase from the 261 million yen recorded in the previous fiscal year. The company’s operating profit is projected to reach 270 million yen, a sharp turnaround from the 468 million yen loss it suffered last year. A substantial portion of Metaplanet’s revenue comes from its Bitcoin-related activities, particularly its strategy of selling Bitcoin put options. This approach generated 520 million yen in income, making it a key driver of the company’s improved financial outlook. Put options allow investors to sell an asset at a pre-agreed strike price, and Metaplanet earns a premium for each contract sold, regardless of whether the option is exercised. If exercised, the company can acquire Bitcoin at the agreed price, aligning with its broader strategy of accumulating the cryptocurrency.

37994093,https://coinpedia.org/?p=396292,1734934710,Regret Not Buying Solana (SOL) at $0.50? Here Are 2 Tokens That Look Like SOL Before It Took Off,"The post Regret Not Buying Solana (SOL) at $0.50? Here Are 2 Tokens That Look Like SOL Before It Took Off appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Solana started small, at $0.50. However, the coin has grown rapidly and ranks sixth in market capitalization among the most successful cryptocurrencies. Market capitalization has increased, reaching fifth position thanks to the SOL token, which has grown tremendously. Meanwhile, SOL is currently trading for $214, a 42000% increase over the last four years. However, the price of the coin has increased tremendously, its constant workings have made it one of the most recognized coins, cutting out the competition. This remarkable growth has made SOL an icon. Yet, investors who missed out on the token can’t turn back the hands of time. However, they still have another chance to see such a parabolic surge. Two tokens— Rexas Finance (RXS) and Sei (SEI)—are showing early bullish potential and might just be the next Solana. Rexas Finance (RXS): The Rising Star of Cryptocurrency Rexas Finance is a new entrant into the crypto market that has leveraged the popular real-world asset sector. The project tokenizes real-world assets like real estate and fine arts, turning them into digital fractions. Through tokenization, Rexas Finance breaks down barriers to entry and allows smaller investors to get involved in real-world assets. This process not only makes investing more transparent but also boosts liquidity. Using blockchain technology, Rexas Finance simplifies asset management and stands out as a leader in this growing space. As more industries adopt blockchain, Rexas Finance is set to grow into a pioneer of real-world asset tokenization. The platform simplifies complex financial systems for individuals and institutions through user-friendly tools like the Rexas Token Builder and Rexas Estate . Rexas Finance has allocated 42.5% of its tokenomics to its public presale, which has been successful and has drawn investors. The presale is currently in stage ten, selling for $0.150. The next stage will increase the price to $0.175; the token’s launch price is expected to be $0.20. The token will skyrocket by 566% before its official launch. Crypto experts are optimistic about its post-launch potential, suggesting that RXS could become a major asset for investors. The project also did a CertiK audit to double-check its security and reliability. The coin is also listed on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, where users can track it in real time, enhancing its visibility and transparency. Additionally, Rexas Finance plans to launch on three major exchanges to reach a broad audience. Rexas Finance achievements and its focus on cutting-edge technology position Rexas as a significant player in the financial space. With its remarkable presale performance and ambitions, RXS is preparing for massive growth. Analysts speculate that it will likely surge past $20 after its launch. In the long run, it could reach more ambitious heights, delivering exponential gains similar to Solana. Thus, investors must refrain from sleeping on this opportunity. Rexas Finance also runs a $1 million giveaway to foster community engagement. Twenty lucky participants will have a chance to win $50,000 worth of RXS tokens each. Sei (SEI): Poised For A Strong Future Sei is a high-performing Layer 1 blockchain launched in September 2023 at $0.14. Since then, it has shown a remarkable increase. SEI reached an all-time high of $1.14 in less than a year, a stunning 714% rise from its starting price. At press time, SEI trades at $0.5. However, it’s still poised to do more, possibly mirroring SOL’s ascent. SEI’s current technical performance suggests a promising future. It also gains social engagement, indicating a rise in community interest in the token, which is a vital foundation for future growth. Sei has gained three million new users in the past three months alone. Investors’ confidence in Sei is also boosted by its dedication to improving its ecosystem. A recent announcement revealed that DEX Screener has been integrated into the network, giving users access to real-time chart tracking and trading insights. This move improves usability and shows Sei’s dedication to providing practical solutions for its users. SEI’s breakout performance and increasing use cases show its potential to become a significant player in the blockchain space. SEI is strategically aligning itself with the broader trend of tokenized assets, a sector gaining global momentum. Sei’s ability to adapt to and thrive in this evolving environment gives it a competitive edge. Sei’s innovative approach and growing adoption suggest it could carve out a lasting role in the blockchain landscape that will help it gain a strong position and reimagine Solana’s momentum in the crypto space. Conclusion If you missed out on the massive profits that investing early in Solana offered, you have another chance to invest in Rexas Finance (RXS) and Sei (SEI), which have great potential like SOL. Rexas Finance will launch at $0.20. It has the potential to grow fast and continue surging to greater heights like Solana. Thus, it offers the best opportunity for those seeking SOL-like gains in 2025.

37994049,https://coinpaper.com/6674/richard-heart-s-legal-troubles-escalate-with-interpol-red-notice,1734934653,Richard Heart’s Legal Troubles Escalate with Interpol Red Notice,"Finnish authorities also placed Richard Heart on Europe’s most wanted list. In a separate case, influencer Haliey Welch is cooperating with legal representatives after allegations of a pump-and-dump scheme involving the Hawk Tuah token. Meanwhile, financial educator Scott Pape exposed crypto scams impersonating him. Additionally, the SEC fined Jump Trading’s Tai Mo Shan $123 million for deceptive practices related to stabilizing TerraUSD (UST) during its 2021 depeg event. Interpol Issues Red Notice for Hex Founder Interpol issued a Red Notice for Richard Schueler, better known as Richard Heart, who is the founder of Hex. The notice was issued for alleged tax fraud and assault. This Red Notice is a global request for law enforcement to locate and provisionally arrest an individual, and was prompted by Finnish authorities. However, it does not constitute an international arrest warrant. Schueler has also been placed on Europe’s most wanted fugitives list, accusing him of assaulting a 16-year-old by grabbing their hair, dragging them into a stairwell, and knocking them to the ground. Richard Schueler’s Red Notice (Source: Interpol ) The remand order for Schueler was issued three months ago, on Sept. 13, with Finnish authorities suspecting him of tax evasion from June of 2020 to April of 2024. The allegations include discrepancies in Schueler’s reported income compared to estimates from tax authorities. On Sept. 18, a Helsinki police detective, Harri Saaristola, told Finnish broadcaster Yle that Heart’s financial disclosures did not align with the tax service’s calculations. Schueler has not publicly addressed the Red Notice just yet, but is still active on social media . In a Dec. 21 post, he commented, “If the haters really wanted to get me down, they could raise more than the $27M I did for medical research.” Schueler is also embroiled in a legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over allegations of unregistered offerings of three cryptocurrency tokens: Hex, PulseChain (PLS), and PulseX (PSLX). The SEC accused Schueler of raising more than $1 billion through these unregistered sales, and claimed he marketed them as a way to achieve wealth. Schueler tried to dismiss the $1 billion lawsuit in August, but the SEC maintained its authority to pursue the case. Haliey Welch Addresses Hawk Tuah Token Scandal Richard Heart is not the only crypto founder currently facing some serious legal troubles. Haliey Welch, the influencer behind the viral “Hawk Tuah” video, addressed the controversy surrounding a meme coin bearing her nickname that experienced a dramatic pump and dump shortly after its launch in December. In a Dec. 20 post on X, Welch stated that she is “fully cooperating” with lawyers representing investors in the Hawk Tuah (HAWK) token. While Welch was not named as a defendant yet, crypto users have filed a lawsuit against the project’s creators and partners, accusing them of promoting and selling an unregistered securities offering. The HAWK token was launched on Dec. 4, and reached a market capitalization of about $500 million before crashing by 90%. This prompted allegations of a rug pull. Welch shared that she is very serious about the matter and encouraged the affected people to contact legal representatives. The controversy stems from her promotion of the token, which used her likeness and branding, as she transitioned from her TikTok fame into the cryptocurrency space. Welch initially gained internet fame in June after a viral clip earned her the nickname “Hawk Tuah” girl. Blockchain data revealed suspicious activity surrounding the token’s launch as one wallet acquired roughly 18% of the HAWK supply and sold it for a profit of over $1 million shortly afterward. Meanwhile, many investors suffered big losses during the token’s rapid decline. It is still uncertain whether Welch or the project’s founders could face criminal or regulatory actions in the United States. The SEC, under Chair Gary Gensler, has taken a very firm stance when it comes to treating most tokens as securities, though the agency’s leadership is expected to shift to Republican control in January. Barefoot Investor Exposes Crypto Scam Tactics Scott Pape, who is known as the “Barefoot Investor,” recently exposed how he tackled crypto scammers who used his identity to defraud his followers. Pape is an Australian financial educator, and shared that he and his team reported hundreds of fake Facebook groups impersonating him to scam people. Frustrated by the slow response from Facebook, Pape decided to engage directly with the fraudsters and investigate their methods. By using a fake name, Pape contacted a fraudulent Facebook page and was invited to join an exclusive WhatsApp group called the “DB Wealth Institute.” A quick search of the group revealed automated press releases about the supposed institute, bragging about its achievements and partnerships with well known platforms. Pape also discovered that U.S. regulators previously warned of similar fake “wealth institutes” that operated through WhatsApp and offered fraudulent crypto trading lessons. The scam followed a familiar pattern: members of the group were provided fake trading signals, encouraged to share fabricated successes, and pressured into making large investments. Bots likely generated the constant flow of messages claiming profitable trades. Pape was guided by an assistant named “Ally,” and even followed one of these signals and saw an 81% profit on a trade, which is a tactic to build confidence and greed. Soon after, he was pressured to invest larger sums, with exclusive programs starting at $20,000 and going up to $5 million. Part of the scam’s strategy is to instil fear and desperation in victims to extract even more money from them. He pointed out that scammers often target victims again after the initial scam by urging them to borrow money in an attempt to recover losses. Pape is the author of the best-selling book The Barefoot Investor, and has been very vocal about fighting financial fraud. According to Chainalysis, crypto scams and hacks in 2024 stole $2.2 billion, a 21% increase from 2023. SEC Fines Tai Mo Shan $123M In May of 2021, after a temporary depegging of the algorithmic TerraUSD stablecoin (UST), the token appeared to stabilize back to its $1 peg automatically. However, according to an SEC complaint , a subsidiary of Jump Trading’s crypto unit, Tai Mo Shan, intervened with $20 million in purchases to stabilize the token. This action allegedly misled investors in UST and its counterpart token, Luna, by giving the impression that Terraform Labs’ stabilization mechanism functioned as intended. The SEC and Tai Mo Shan reached a settlement which requires the firm to pay $123 million in fines, including over $86 million in disgorgement and $36 million as a civil penalty. The disgorgement amount was based on profits Tai Mo Shan allegedly earned by purchasing UST during the depeg event and subsequently receiving and selling unlocked luna tokens. These actions, according to the SEC, deceived investors about the efficacy of Terraform Labs’ arbitrage mechanism. Earlier SEC allegations also suggested that Tai Mo Shan profited $1.28 billion from these transactions, but the settlement was reached without the firm admitting or denying the findings. Terraform Labs founder Do Kwon publicly claimed that TerraUSD survived a severe stress test, and used the situation as proof of the algorithmic mechanism’s robustness. However, the SEC pointed out that the lack of transparency about Tai Mo Shan’s involvement misled the market about UST’s stability. Jump Crypto’s president, Kanav Kariya, invoked his Fifth Amendment rights during a previous deposition about the deal. As part of the settlement, Tai Mo Shan agreed to pay the penalty without admitting any wrongdoing. Overall, the SEC holds firm that the intervention misrepresented UST’s stability and Terraform Labs’ system.

37997414,https://cryptonews.com/?p=321859,1734934532,Crypto Fear & Greed Index Hits Lowest Mark Since Trump’s Presidential Win,"The Crypto Fear and Greed Index , measuring the crypto market’s emotional pulse, has dropped to its lowest level since Donald Trump’s presidential victory last month . On Monday, the index reached 70, matching its level just before Trump’s decisive victory. He had captured several swing states, while the Republican Party also gained control of the Senate. This index scales from 0, indicating extreme fear, to 100, signaling extreme greed. It helps traders and investors assess whether the market is driven by fear or greed, guiding their buying and selling decisions. Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index is 70 – Greed Current price: $94,586 Follow on Telegram: https://t.co/XKOdVF2cCZ pic.twitter.com/VGNZJMlDui — Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index (@BitcoinFear) December 23, 2024 Bitcoin Sentiment Cools as Fear and Greed Index Drops from Post-Trump Highs In the days following Trump’s election, the index soared to as much as 94, indicating peak market greed and potential overvaluation. This high came even before Bitcoin recorded an all-time high on. Dec. 17. Now, the index’s drop to 70 still reflects a greed-driven market, with investors remaining overly confident but less intensely so. The shift also shows a slight rise in risk awareness among some investors. At 90, greed often fuels unchecked pursuit of gains, while at 70, investors start paying attention to warnings about potential corrections or bubbles. Currently, Bitcoin is trading around $95,488, and is down over 8% in the last week. The asset’s price often mirrors investor sentiment, rising quickly when greed drives expectations of gains and falling sharply as fear prompts sell-offs. No Clear Pattern for Bitcoin Over Holidays? James Toledano, COO at Unity Wallet, offered advice on Bitcoin’s holiday-season behavior. He drew a parallel between Bitcoin’s volatility and the constant wetness of water, stating that just as water is always wet, Bitcoin is always volatile. “It’s behavior is always mixed and there is zero discernible pattern at the end of the year and going into the next,” he said. “Sometimes the price rises in the new year and at other times it falls. So, historically, we can say that Bitcoin exhibits typically mixed behavior over Christmas and New Year.” He clarified that although lower liquidity might amplify volatility, a lack of significant institutional involvement could conversely stabilize prices. However, exceptions occur in years when macroeconomic news or market catalysts trigger abrupt changes. “This year, much depends on investor sentiment following 2024’s ETF approval and the Trump-factor as well as other macro trends. A relatively quiet period is possible unless unexpected news reignites volatility. But given that on Jan 20th, pro-Bitcoin Trump will be back in the White House, I think we can expect a lot of price movement again very soon,” he added.

37993798,https://coinpedia.org/?p=396286,1734934097,"Pepe (PEPE) Consolidates Around $10 Billion Market Cap, Could It Run To Over $100 Billion In 2025?","The post Pepe (PEPE) Consolidates Around $10 Billion Market Cap, Could It Run To Over $100 Billion In 2025? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Pepe (PEPE) has been making waves in the crypto market, holding steady at a $10 billion market cap. As interest grows, analysts debate whether the token has what it takes to break into the $100 billion range by 2025. With meme coins often driven by community enthusiasm and speculative trends, PEPE’s trajectory will likely depend on sustained investor interest and market conditions. PEPE Holds Steady On Blockchain Activity According to data from Coinglass, PEPE spot metrics revealed over $2.61 billion in outflow over the past week. This massive outflow from exchanges typically indicates potential upside momentum as investors hold on to tokens in personal wallets or cold storage. The less PEPE in exchanges, the higher the value of its scarce tokens. On December 14 , a dormant whale account became active, moving its entire balance worth 2.1 trillion PEPE. The investor initially bought these tokens for $27, and now, the same tokens are worth over 1,900,000 times that amount. These kinds of big shifts typically indicate that whales have faith in the asset or are getting ready for price changes. At 4.15, Binance’s PEPEUSDT Long/Short Ratio shows a high level of trader interest. At the moment, around 20% of top Binance traders hold short, while 80% hold long positions. What are The PEPE Technicals Saying? Per technicals, PEPE has formed a descending triangle pattern after a short consolidation period around the $10 billion market cap. PEPE could close a week-long candle above the $0.000032 level with a breakout imminent. According to price prediction analysis , PEPE is forecast to rise by 226% and reach $0.000074 by January 16, 2025. With a 14-day RSI of 51, PEPE is neither overbought nor oversold, indicating a chance for an upside rally. Combining these metrics, it makes sense that PEPE is slightly above its mid-November price. However, PEPE continues to trade above its moving averages as bull traders expect a significant surge in the coming days. Currently, large transactions are up to $1.82 billion on PEPE with 6,230 active addresses. With 90% of holders in profit, the token has experienced heightened investments in expectation of a bullish incline. According to data from IntoTheBlock, about 20% of PEPE holders came in the past month. The Next Thing For PEPE Holders As the Ethereum network expands, so have PEPE and RTX. With the launch of its cross-border payment system, Remittix (RTX) is forecast to yield a higher return on investment. The hot new crypto is focused on overcoming the hurdle of international payments with a crypto-to-fiat structure, low fees, and resilience to location restrictions.

Daddy Pepe (DADDPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 11,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DADDPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Daddy Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Daddy Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Daddy Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Daddy Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Daddy Pepe by entering its contract address – 9UFnMabUe7wecdEEzAYPoQPZiuTJ1hTFpNz6qtsiB3FA – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DADDPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/daddy-pepe-daddpepe-solana-memecoin-will-surge-11000-ahead-of-exchange-listing-while-shiba-inu-and-doge-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

The overwhelming support of crypto-friendly US leaders has changed the entire perspective of digital assets, especially by institutional investors during the past few weeks. Furthermore, more investment fund managers have filed for spot altcoins ETF including Solana, XRP, and Litecoin, among others with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). With the ongoing macro crypto bull market, more funds are expected to follow into the web3 industry ahead. When Dogecoin Spot ETF? Dogecoin (DOGE) has remained a leader in the memecoin industry, majorly due to the unwavering support from tech billionaire Elon Musk. The Dogecoin network, which is secured by the legendary proof-of-work consensus mechanism, takes pride in more than 5.9 million on-chain holders. However, none of the pro-crypto investment fund managers have filed for a spot Dogecoin ETF with the US SEC to date. According to Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, the inauguration of U.S. president-elect Donald Trump will set the precedent for investment fund managers to file for spot Dogecoin ETF. Moreover, the entrance of Paul Atkins as the US SEC chair will significantly improve the chances of crypto ETF approvals. “If I’m Vegas my favorite on reserver of $DOGE ticker is Venuto. That said Tuttle is my fav to file for the ETF,” Balchunas noted . Whales on a Buying Spree According to on-chain data analysis provided by Santiment , crypto whales purchased 250 million Dogecoins, worth more than $77 million, during the recent market dip. As a result, Dogecoin whales with a balance of between 1 million and 10 million units now hold more than 10.7 billion DOGE units, which is nearly 1 percent of the total circulating supply. Midterm Targets Dogecoin price has been trapped in a midterm correction phase after registering palpable gains in the past two months. The large-cap memecoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $47 billion and a daily average traded volume of around $5 billion, is currently retesting the support level around the 0.5 daily Fibonacci Retracement, which could yield a major rebound soon. In the weekly time frame, DOGE price is aiming for an all-time high after the Relative Strength Index (RSI) rallied above the 85 percent level for the first time since mid-2021.",POSITIVE,DOGE,ALTCOIN | DOGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bloomberg-etf-analyst-hints-dogecoin-spot-etf-filing-under-trump-presidency/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

BlackRock hints at plans for an XRP ETF, signalling increased institutional interest. Ethereum continues to show bullish momentum, aiming for a significant milestone of $10,000. Meanwhile, Yeti Ouro (YETIO), a rising altcoin, dominates presale charts with its unique utility and community focus. BlackRock’s XRP ETF Announcement BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, recently acknowledged growing interest in cryptocurrency ETFs. While prioritizing Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs, the company confirmed it is exploring an XRP-focused ETF. This move reflects institutional recognition of XRP’s growing use in cross-border payments. 1-month XRP price chart- source: CoinMarketCap However, BlackRock stated that launching a spot XRP ETF might not happen immediately. The regulatory landscape in the U.S. remains a challenge for altcoin ETFs. Despite this, BlackRock’s interest in XRP price signals potential for future growth and institutional adoption. Ethereum Price Prediciton: ETH Price Road To $10,000 Ethereum continues to attract attention with its intense price action. After surpassing $4,000 earlier this year, Ethereum price analysts believe $10,000 is within reach. Factors driving this bullish outlook include increased adoption of Ethereum-based DeFi platforms and institutional investments. 1-month Ethereum price chart- source: CoinMarketCap The recent introduction of Ethereum spot ETFs has also played a key role. These ETFs have provided easier access for investors, further boosting demand. Analysts predict that its price will continue to soar as Ethereum transitions into scalability upgrades like sharding. Yeti Ouro: The Utility Altcoin Stealing the Spotlight While XRP and Ethereum dominate headlines, Yeti Ouro has captured significant attention during its presale phase. The altcoin, positioned as a utility memecoin, has raised over $1.27 million in its second presale stage. Yeti Ouro’s success lies in its gaming ecosystem and real-world use cases. Yeti Ouro powers Yeti Go, an innovative Play-to-Earn (P2E) game developed on Unreal Engine. Players can earn, stake, and trade YETIO tokens within the game. Its tokenomics include a capped supply of 1 billion, ensuring scarcity and potential value growth. Moreover, Yeti Ouro isn’t just about games. The platform features staking rewards, token-burning mechanisms, and vibrant community-driven initiatives. One such initiative is the ongoing Yeti Ouro Meme Contest , where participants can win up to $2,000 in YETIO by creating funny, creative memes. The contest has added an engaging social element, further strengthening Yeti Ouro’s community appeal. Ending on the 25th of December, for more information please visit Yeti Ouro official X channel. What’s Next for Yeti Ouro? Yeti Ouro’s ecosystem aims to revolutionize how utility tokens integrate with gaming and DeFi. Its roadmap includes partnerships with gaming studios and expansion into other decentralized applications. Yeti Ouro could become a top altcoin contender with growing investor interest and community support. Crypto enthusiasts are taking notice of Yeti Ouro’s presale success. As the presale progresses, the token price will increase, offering early investors a chance for higher returns. Yeti Ouro presents a unique opportunity for those looking to diversify beyond major coins like XRP and Ethereum. Final Thoughts BlackRock’s potential XRP ETF signals broader adoption of crypto assets in institutional markets. Ethereum’s bullish outlook and price targets showcase its dominance in the blockchain space. However, it’s Yeti Ouro that has emerged as a surprising contender. With its innovative ecosystem, gaming integration, and strong community engagement, Yeti Ouro offers a fresh perspective in the altcoin space. For investors seeking high-growth opportunities, Yeti Ouro’s presale is worth exploring. Yeti Ouro stands out in a crowded market with its strong utility and fun initiatives like the meme contest.

37994816,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52909,1734932763,"In December 2014, 1 BTC Bought 43,000 XRP. Here’s What It’s Today","In a recent post on X, crypto investor and analyst Dom (@traderview2) highlighted an intriguing observation regarding XRP’s performance relative to Bitcoin (BTC). Dom pointed out that in December 2014, one Bitcoin could purchase 43,000 XRP. Today, despite Bitcoin’s significant price appreciation over the years, one Bitcoin still buys 43,000 XRP. This parity suggests that XRP has managed to maintain its value relative to Bitcoin over the last decade. In December 2014, 1 $BTC bought you 43,000 $XRP Today, 1 $BTC buys you 43,000 $XRP Tell me more about that underperformance… pic.twitter.com/Z4sdUtwnw8 — Dom (@traderview2) December 21, 2024 This observation counters common narratives in the cryptocurrency community, where XRP is often criticized for underperformance as some skeptics claim that XRP’s value will go to zero . Dom’s statement has sparked discussions about XRP’s historical price trends, volatility, and investment potential. XRP’s Performance Relative to Bitcoin Protector (@protechtor), a crypto investor on X, expanded on Dom’s observation by emphasizing XRP’s unique price behavior. According to his analysis, XRP can consolidate for extended periods, followed by abrupt and significant price surges. This cyclical pattern of “very low volatility to extreme volatility” sets XRP apart from other cryptocurrencies and positions it as an asset that can quickly recover and even outperform during certain market conditions. He shared a chart highlighting the performance of both assets from November 2023 to now. Bitcoin was at the bottom of the current cycle, hitting a low point below $35k. XRP spent much of that time consolidating below $0.6. It stayed close to this level for most of 2024 while Bitcoin soared to new heights. However, as the chart shows, XRP shot up after this prolonged consolidation, catching up with Bitcoin and eventually overtaking its performance. According to Protechtor and as shown by this performance, XRP offers a unique risk/reward dynamic. Specifically, during the early stages of bull markets, XRP’s relative undervaluation presents opportunities for investors seeking returns exceeding the market average. What’s Next For XRP? XRP’s ability to maintain its value against Bitcoin over such a long period challenges the notion that it is a consistently underperforming asset. From a historical perspective, XRP has endured multiple market cycles, regulatory challenges, and shifts in investor sentiment while preserving its relative position to Bitcoin. This spectacular performance has changed the minds of many prominent figures including Peter Brandt, a well-known trader and financial expert. Brandt recently shared what he described as the most powerful chart in the crypto world, and he has high expectations for XRP in the current cycle. At press time, the digital asset traded at $2.18, with a slight 3.4% decline over the past 24 hours. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The CEA's role is to advise the president on economic issues, including evaluating the effectiveness of federal policies and programs, analyzing economic trends, and crafting recommendations to foster growth and stability.  Miran has long been an advocate for crypto, recently appearing on Blockworks' Forward Guidance podcast. He has previously tweeted about how crypto regulations need to be reformed in the U.S. to allow for innovation to flourish.  Miran has previously criticized Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell as ""wrong politically and economically"" for urging Congress to pass a stimulus bill in October 2020.  This appointment comes as Trump himself has pledged to make the U.S. the “crypto capital of the planet” and earlier floated the idea of a strategic bitcoin reserve.  Recently, Trump announced he was appointing crypto advocate Paul Atkins as Securities and Exchange Commission chair. Atkins had previously served as a Commissioner at the SEC during the George W. Bush administration.  Trump also appointed former congressional candidate Bo Hines as Executive Director of the Presidential Council of Advisers for Digital Assets.  In a post on Truth Social, Trump said Hines would collaborate with David Sacks, the incoming ""Crypto Czar,"" to advance the administration's crypto agenda.

37997412,https://cryptonews.com/?p=321854,1734931904,Securitize Proposes BUIDL Token as Collateral for Frax USD Stablecoin,"Securitize, the brokerage behind the tokenized BlackRock US Dollar Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), has proposed adding BUIDL as collateral for the Frax USD stablecoin. The proposal, submitted as a Frax Improvement Proposal (FIP), highlights the advantages of leveraging BUIDL, which invests in U.S. government securities, as a reserve asset. The key benefits outlined in the proposal include yield generation opportunities, enhanced liquidity and transferability, and reduced counterparty risk due to BlackRock’s backing — the world’s largest asset manager. Proposal is Subject to a Community Vote Notably, the inclusion of BUIDL as collateral is subject to a community vote. Tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) like BUIDL are increasingly being adopted as collateral for stablecoins. These assets offer cost efficiencies, quick settlement times, and unique high-yield opportunities, making them attractive in the stablecoin ecosystem. “In addition to providing Frax USD utility, relative safety, and convenience, Frax USD can significantly reduce counterparty risk for its reserves by working with BlackRock,” the proposal read. 1/ BlackRock Frax @BlackRock , the world's largest asset manager, is proposing to become an enshrined custodian to power Frax USD $frxUSD fiat redeemability. Read the full proposal posted by BUIDL tokenization provider @Securitize here: https://t.co/K2kzZqGR10 Learn more https://t.co/7KC79iTGNG pic.twitter.com/k3c5BdBnbv — Frax Finance ¤ ¤ (@fraxfinance) December 22, 2024 Ethena Labs, the developer behind the synthetic dollar USDe, launched a separate stablecoin, USDtb, backed by the BUIDL fund in September 2024. Unlike USDe, which relies on complex trading strategies, USDtb is overcollateralized by cash and short-term U.S. government securities, maintaining a 1:1 backing with U.S. dollars. USDtb went live on December 16, 2024, amassing $65 million in total value locked on its first day of trading. In parallel, BlackRock has been advocating for BUIDL’s use as collateral on crypto derivatives exchanges. The asset manager has reportedly engaged with Binance, OKX, and Deribit to incorporate BUIDL into their platforms. This move could challenge the dominance of traditional stablecoins like Tether and Circle in collateral reserves for derivatives trading. Additionally, BUIDL has already found use in decentralized finance (DeFi). The Elixir Protocol’s deUSD stablecoin can now be minted using BUIDL as collateral on Curve Finance, allowing seamless swaps with other stablecoins in Curve’s liquidity pools. Tokenization Market Could Reach $16T by 2030 McKinsey & Company recently reported that tokenized financial assets have had a “cold start” but are still expected to grow to a $2 trillion market by 2030. Meanwhile, a report by the Global Financial Markets Association (GFMA) and Boston Consulting Group estimates the global value of tokenized illiquid assets will reach $16 trillion by 2030 . Even more conservative estimates from Citigroup suggest that $4 trillion to $5 trillion worth of tokenized digital securities could be minted by 2030. Recognizing this potential, major companies are making significant moves in the tokenization space. Goldman Sachs, for instance, plans to launch three new tokenization products later this year, driven by growing client interest. Some protocols have played a significant role in driving this growth, particularly in terms of active users. Digital carbon market platforms like Toucan and KlimaDAO, as well as the real estate tokenization protocol Propy, have experienced substantial user growth. It is worth noting that both public and private blockchains are witnessing the inclusion of various assets.

37993062,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52887,1734931822,"Tron Targets $0.65 Breakout, Sui and Lunex Network Set To Bounce To New Price Levels","The crypto market is heating up as top altcoins eye potential breakouts in the coming weeks. Tron (TRX) is inching closer to a breakout at $0.65, exciting traders and enthusiasts alike. Meanwhile, Sui (SUI) and Lunex Network (LNEX) are gaining momentum, poised for potential price rebounds. With strong market sentiment and favorable technical indicators, these assets could be on the verge of significant price movements. Sui (SUI) Forecasted To Bounce To $5 In a recent tweet, a top expert called Suipiens.sui argued that the Sui (SUI) downtrend could be over. According to him, the next phase now is for the DeFi token to bounce back to former highs. The analyst congratulated those who refused to sell during the dip. He encouraged them to hold tight as the Sui coin could rise to $5 soon. Also, he highlighted a buying opportunity around $3.6 for those who missed the Sui token before. At the moment, Sui (SUI) is trading above a key level. Price information from CoinMarketCap shows the Sui price has increased by 3.8% in the weekly timeframe. We might see the cryptocurrency rising to retest higher levels as long as it holds above $3. A drop from this level could push the value of the altcoin to former lows in the coming weeks. On the flip side, most of Sui’s technical indicators are bullish. The relative strength index is above average, a sign that bulls are not perturbed by the ongoing downtrend. Tron (TRX) Poised For Breakout To $0.65 The Tron (TRX) coin is among the top performers in the market right now. Data from CoinMarketCap platform shows TRX’s price rose to $0.425 recently. Although it has witnessed a minor correction, most of its technical indicators are still bullish. Its relative strength index is above the midline, a signal that bulls are active. Also, the Fear and Greed Index is showing extreme Greed. Looking ahead, analysts have posted bullish predictions for the Tron token. One of them is Evan Luthra. He predicts the value of this coin is getting ready for an all-time high breakout retest. According to him, the Tron price might rise to two targets. The first target is $0.65. If this cryptocurrency’s upward movement continues, Luthra believes the altcoin price could rise to the second target, $1.25. Another analyst called UB is also bullish about the Tron crypto . However, he said TRX must reclaim the $0.31 level to continue its uptrend. Lunex Network (LNEX) Raises Close To $5M In Presale Lunex Network (LNEX) is currently in presale, attracting significant interest in the DeFi market . Priced at $0.0048 per token, the project has already raised over $5.4 million. Analysts predict a potential 18x rally, making Lunex one of the most promising DeFi projects . Lunex stands out with its privacy-focused approach, eliminating the need for KYC procedures. This allows users to trade and trade assets anonymously. It also saves them the stress of going through long registration processes that make centralized exchanges discouraging to traders. Additionally, the platform offers access to 65+ RPC nodes, supporting decentralized applications and empowering developers to build on various blockchains. Furthermore, Lunex Network has a unique revenue-sharing model. It shares a part of its revenue with those who stake their tokens for at least 30 days. This is how it works. First, Lunex Network will use a part of its revenue to buy back some coins from the market. 50% of these coins are shared with stakers while the other half are kep5 as incentives for other purposes. Lunex Network’s combination of no-KYC policies, robust RPC infrastructure, and user-friendly features positions it as a comprehensive DeFi platform. The presale is shaping Lunex into a versatile and privacy-oriented solution for both traders and developers. In Conclusion The best cryptos to consider right now are Tron (TRX), Sui (SUI), and Lunex Network. Analysts say investors should see the ongoing downtrend as a good buying opportunity to stock up their portfolios before the bull run begins.

37992717,https://coinpaper.com/6675/corporate-bitcoin-pioneer-micro-strategy-surpasses-2021-bull-market-purchases,1734931800,Corporate Bitcoin Pioneer MicroStrategy Surpasses 2021 Bull Market Purchases,"MicroStrategy, a pioneer in corporate Bitcoin adoption, has recently made waves with significant developments that show its strategic focus on cryptocurrency and its growing influence in both the traditional financial and digital asset sectors. The company set new records with its largest-ever Bitcoin acquisitions in November 2024, while simultaneously preparing for its inclusion in the Nasdaq 100 index. To bolster its leadership, MicroStrategy has welcomed three prominent executives as well, including former Binance.US CEO Brian Brooks, to its board of directors. MicroStrategy’s Record-Breaking Bitcoin Acquisitions: A New Era of Corporate Crypto Investment MicroStrategy, led by its co-founder and Bitcoin evangelist Michael Saylor, has once again made headlines by surpassing its previous Bitcoin acquisition records. The company’s recent purchases during November and December 2024 have not only eclipsed its previous all-time highs but also outpaced the buying intensity of the 2021 bull market. These bold moves solidify MicroStrategy’s position as a corporate leader in Bitcoin adoption and further reinforce the asset's potential as a cornerstone for institutional portfolios. According to Saylortracker , MicroStrategy purchased 27,200 BTC on Nov. 10, 2024, at an average price of $74,000 per Bitcoin. The pace only accelerated from there, with the company acquiring 51,780 BTC on Nov. 17 and culminating in its largest single purchase to date: 55,500 BTC on Nov. 24 at an average price of $97,000 per coin. These figures are staggering, even compared to MicroStrategy’s prior Bitcoin acquisitions during the 2020-2021 bull run. At that time, its largest single purchase was 29,646 BTC on Dec. 21, 2020, when Bitcoin traded around $21,000. The latest acquisitions demonstrate the company’s unwavering belief in Bitcoin's long-term value, even as the cryptocurrency reaches new price milestones. MicroStrategy’s aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy has long been a topic of interest and emulation. The firm’s approach is predicated on using Bitcoin as a superior store of value compared to traditional assets. By transferring capital from the stock market into the Bitcoin market, MicroStrategy has not only enhanced its corporate treasury but also inspired other institutions to follow suit. Traders and analysts alike see these acquisitions as a bullish signal, injecting institutional liquidity and interest into the cryptocurrency market. Michael Saylor has repeatedly voiced his long-term commitment to Bitcoin, stating in a recent interview with Yahoo Finance, “I am sure that I will be buying Bitcoin at $1 million a coin — probably $1 billion dollars a day of Bitcoin at $1 million a coin.” A Catalyst for Bitcoin’s Market Adoption The timing of MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin purchases aligns with broader developments in Bitcoin adoption and market dynamics. The inclusion of MicroStrategy in the Nasdaq 100 index, effective Dec. 23, 2024, marks a pivotal moment. The Nasdaq 100 is a weighted index of the 100 largest companies listed on the Nasdaq exchange by market capitalization, and MicroStrategy’s entry provides indirect exposure to Bitcoin for stock investors. This inclusion means that holders of ETFs like the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ), which manages over $322 billion in assets, will gain exposure to Bitcoin through MicroStrategy’s holdings. MicroStrategy’s persistent Bitcoin acquisitions are seen as a bullish catalyst by many in the crypto space. The company’s confidence in Bitcoin’s future — even at prices nearing six figures — reinforces its narrative as a robust asset class for institutional investors. Moreover, the increasing size of its purchases may reflect growing confidence in Bitcoin’s potential to outperform traditional assets. As Bitcoin continues its upward trajectory, MicroStrategy’s actions bring attention to a shift in the corporate landscape. The company’s strategic focus on Bitcoin could inspire similar moves by other publicly traded firms, further driving institutional adoption and mainstream acceptance of the cryptocurrency. MicroStrategy Strengthens Board with High-Profile Appointments Amid Nasdaq 100 Inclusion In related news, MicroStrategy has appointed three prominent executives — former Binance.US CEO Brian Brooks, Galaxy Digital board member Jane Dietze, and Fanatics Holdings' Chief Legal Officer Gregg Winiarski — to its board of directors. This strategic move comes on the heels of Nasdaq’s announcement that MicroStrategy will be added to the prestigious Nasdaq 100 index. The appointments, disclosed in a Dec. 20 filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), expand MicroStrategy’s board to nine members. Each of the new directors — Brooks, Dietze, and Winiarski — brings unique expertise and deep connections across financial, legal, and regulatory landscapes. According to the filing, all three are eligible for equity awards, aligning their incentives with the company’s long-term goals. Among the appointees, Brian Brooks stands out as a pivotal addition. Brooks, who served as the United States Comptroller of the Currency for nine months in 2021, oversaw the entire US banking system and earned a reputation as a pro-crypto regulator. His appointment has been described as a “BIG deal” by Bitcoin platform Swan Bitcoin, which noted Brooks’ deep regulatory expertise and connections within the financial ecosystem. Brooks previously gained attention in the crypto community after being rumored as a potential replacement for SEC Chair Gary Gensler under Donald Trump. The timing of these appointments coincides with MicroStrategy’s upcoming inclusion in the Nasdaq 100, a benchmark index comprising the 100 largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq exchange. On Dec. 13, Nasdaq confirmed that MicroStrategy would join the index alongside Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) and Axon Enterprise, Inc. (AXON). The three companies will replace Illumina, Inc. (ILMN), Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI), and Moderna, Inc. (MRNA), which will be removed from the index. The listing positions MicroStrategy among the Nasdaq’s most significant stocks by market capitalization, reflecting the company’s evolution from a software provider to a de facto Bitcoin hedge fund. MicroStrategy’s inclusion also extends Bitcoin exposure to a broader audience, as Nasdaq 100-linked exchange-traded funds (ETFs), such as the Invesco QQQ Trust, indirectly represent the company’s substantial Bitcoin holdings. This development is seen as a milestone for integrating cryptocurrency into traditional financial markets. Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy’s co-founder and executive chairman, has consistently advocated for Bitcoin’s role as a superior store of value. Under his leadership, the company transformed its treasury strategy in 2020, accumulating billions of dollars’ worth of Bitcoin. Saylor has repeatedly emphasized his belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition, stating that MicroStrategy is committed to buying Bitcoin throughout its lifecycle. This bold approach has not only solidified MicroStrategy’s reputation but has also inspired other corporations to consider Bitcoin as a strategic asset. The company’s significant Bitcoin holdings have contributed to its reclassification as a Bitcoin-focused entity, drawing attention from institutional investors and crypto enthusiasts alike. A Strategic Inflection Point MicroStrategy’s recent developments demonstrate its dual role as a software company and a Bitcoin market leader. The inclusion of seasoned executives like Brooks, Dietze, and Winiarski, combined with its Nasdaq 100 listing, represents a strategic inflection point for the company. The appointments enhance MicroStrategy’s ability to navigate regulatory complexities, foster institutional relationships, and further integrate Bitcoin into traditional financial systems. As Brian Brooks takes his seat at the boardroom table, his regulatory expertise and industry insights are expected to play a crucial role in shaping MicroStrategy’s future. By strengthening its leadership team and achieving inclusion in the Nasdaq 100, MicroStrategy continues to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the burgeoning cryptocurrency sector. As Michael Saylor and his team push forward, MicroStrategy is poised to remain a trailblazer in corporate Bitcoin adoption, inspiring other firms to follow suit and paving the way for broader institutional engagement with digital assets.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6675/corporate-bitcoin-pioneer-micro-strategy-surpasses-2021-bull-market-purchases,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

Many holders are turning to modern protocols, such as Arbitrum and Lunex Network, to diversify their investments. While Arbitrum has established a strong reputation for its approach to security, Lunex Network ($LNEX) is amassing popularity for its extensive value offering. So why are Ethereum holders pinning their hopes on these two projects? Ethereum (ETH) Dips Despite Efficiency Progress Ethereum (ETH) has had a slow year, growing by 67% in total. Ethereum (ETH) has lagged behind other crypto titans who have largely seen bigger gains. There have been glimmers of technological progress for Ethereum, as the Ethereum developers managed to cut the network’s energy consumption massively, which was a long criticized shortcoming of Ethereum among holders. However, this hasn’t managed to spur much growth, and in the last 5 days, Ethereum (ETH) has dipped by 5%. Arbitrum (ARB) Activates Stylus Update On Mainnets Arbitrum (ARB) has found a new lease of life, with Arbitrum’s price soaring by 54% in the last month and 12% over the last 24 hours. These price increases followed Arbitrum’s activation of the Stylus protocol on its mainnets. This update allows developers to use a variety of additional languages to code smart contracts on the network. This massively enhances the appeal of Arbitrum (ARB) developers globally, as many networks are yet to make these adjustments. Arbitrum is looking strong going into 2025 despite some fluctuations earlier in the year.

One of the fake groups using Scott Pape’s name. Source: Facebook Pape decided to engage with the fraudsters and explain their methods instead of waiting on Facebook to take down these groups since this could allow more frauds to spread. He took up a fake name on Facebook and asked for investment advice from the scammers. Within hours of contacting a fake Facebook page, he was solicited to share his phone number and then offered a chance to join an ‘exclusive’ WhatsApp group called the ‘DB Wealth Institute.’ Pape looked up DB Wealth Institute on Google and quickly sifted through several automated press releases about the ‘investing firm’ and even on Yahoo Finance, Forbes, and LinkedIn. One press release notes that “ DB Wealth Institute, founded in 2011 by Professor Cillian Miller, offers practical financial training and developed ‘AI Financial Navigator 4.0,’ integrating AI with big data to enhance trading strategies. By 2024, it had trained over 30,000 students from more than ten countries. “ US regulators and financial authorities had warned of such scams by “wealth institutes” Pape added that further research revealed that many US regulators and financial authorities had warned of fake ‘wealth institutes’ trading crypto through WhatsApp. The State Department of Financial Institutions (DFI) gave the script of the scammers after receiving many complaints. Such frauds include a ‘professor’ who provides false trading signals to group members that they can invest their money in and an assistant who communicates with investors. As soon as the group realizes enough money has been gathered, it disappears with the funds, rebrands, and then goes after new victims. The DFI explains . The alleged fraud typically starts with an investor being placed into a WhatsApp or Telegram group. The ‘Professor’ and founder of the company provides investment courses such as ‘daily trading signals’ that result in exorbitant rates of return . DFI Scammers rely on victims’ desperations after robbing them Pepe noted that the professor launched a “partner program” categorizing investors and how much they were willing to invest. The investment packages varied from $20,000 to $5 million. He pulled the pin at this point, stating that he understood the script by helping scam victims. The script was similar. He noted that scammers smell desperation and prey on it without mercy. When you notice you have been robbed, they encourage you to borrow money to help recover your losses. The fact is, the biggest loss happens when you realize you have been scammed. Cryptocurrency hacks, including scams and exploits, reached $2.2 billion in 2024, an almost 21% increase from $1.8 billion in 2023.

Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, has already had a private meeting with President Trump, which caused a major movement in the market, especially for the XRP price. In addition to Ripple, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and his company donated $1 million to President Trump’s inauguration. Now, global trading platform Kraken and tokenized DeFi project Ondo Finance have also contributed US $1 million each. Donors will be invited to a Sunday service, an inaugural ball, and even have the chance to meet members of Trump’s cabinet.

Ripple’s involvement in significant events like this, coupled with its partnerships with institutions like Bitstamp and its ongoing efforts in the global market, solidifies its place as a leading player in the crypto world.

Given their current market positions and ongoing advancements, such a milestone would likely significantly impact altcoins like XRP, Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Yeti Ouro (YETIO). XRP Price Outlook Amid Bitcoin’s $200K Prediction Ripple’s XRP can gain substantial upward movement with Bitcoin price set to rise to $200,000. Ripple currently trades at $2.51; the key resistance area for XRP is $2.72, while the support level is situated at $2.42. Some of the figures economists highlight are crucial to keeping these levels to support a bullish scenario. If Bitcoin’s growth sparks market-wide rallies, XRP could surpass its December high of $2.92 and aim for its all-time high of $3.43. A further breakout might take XRP to $5.85, marking a 133% increase. This aligns with Ripple’s network advancements and potential legal clarity. Source X However, short-term corrections pose risks. Analysts stress that holding support at $2.42 and $2.38 is crucial for a continued upward trajectory. XRP’s performance will depend on broader market trends and investor sentiment in the coming months. Shiba Inu Price Prediction: SHIB Growth Potential In A Bull Market As Bitcoin approaches $200K, Shiba Inu (SHIB) might gain more energy. Since September, SHIB’s price increased, although there have been fluctuations and sales in recent weeks, such as the 250 billion SHIBs sold by a whale. The token is heavily staked and used at $0.00002424, essentially a profitable standing. Analysts predict that SHIB price will trade at $0.00003232 and $0.00004 by the end of 2024, up by 25.6% and 61.6%, respectively. However, in the long run, the forecast is to rise to $0.00007012, which is near an all-time high of $0.00007013, in effect increasing by 172.5%. Upcoming projects like Shibarium, a Layer 2 blockchain solution, are expected to enhance SHIB’s utility and boost investor confidence. Source X Maintaining current support levels and overcoming key resistance points will be crucial for SHIB’s next breakout. However, whale activity remains a key factor influencing price stability and market sentiment. SHIB continues to hold promise as it navigates these challenges amidst growing interest in the crypto space. Yeti Ouro’s Rising Potential In The Play-to-Earn Sector Yeti Ouro, a new Ethereum-based token priced at $0.017, is gaining traction within the Play-to-Earn (P2E) space. The token’s integration into Yeti Go, an upcoming P2E game, adds utility to the project. Yeti Ouro has already raised over $1.27 million during its presale and employs a deflationary model with token burns. Developers of Yeti Go are collaborating with industry leaders responsible for iconic games like Call of Duty and The Witcher 3 . The game aims to deliver a high-quality experience with immersive audio and dynamic gameplay. With a capped supply of one billion tokens, Yeti Ouro is positioned for long-term growth if market conditions align with Bitcoin’s upward trajectory. If Bitcoin hits $200,000, investor interest in utility-driven projects like Yeti Ouro may rise. However, the project’s growth will depend on its ability to deliver on its ambitious roadmap and attract a larger player base. Yeti Ouro has recently announced a meme contest!

Musk the Manipulator (MUSKMANI), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKMANI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk the Manipulator can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk the Manipulator could become the next viral memecoin. Musk the Manipulator launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk the Manipulator on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk the Manipulator by entering its contract address – DZpfk5LaLrnP6vSFJnLSMAopUuTJGiFk7543rQxh4ids – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

A clear plan is followed throughout the project’s development in order to produce a scalable and interesting platform. In its foundational phase, the team completed project scoping, whitepaper development, and website creation to ensure technical feasibility and strategic alignment. Subsequent efforts included launching the Token Generation Event (TGE) and the initial $RACE token sales. This phase also focused on enhancing the platform’s website to support seamless user interaction. The next phase will see the platform’s full launch, where participants can actively use their $RACE tokens to predict the outcomes of virtual races. As part of its long-term vision, Race to a Billion plans to expand its ecosystem through collaborations with exchanges and influencers. These efforts aim to establish $RACE as a prominent token in the Web3 landscape while fostering a vibrant and engaged community. Balanced Tokenomics for Sustainability The Race to a Billion platform features a total supply of 2.5 billion $RACE tokens, strategically distributed to support growth and incentivize participation. 40% of the supply, equivalent to one billion tokens, is allocated for token distribution phases to engage early adopters. 20% is reserved for staking, encouraging long-term holding and active participation. The remaining tokens are evenly divided across development, marketing, liquidity, and ecosystem support, each receiving 10%. This balanced tokenomics approach supports platform growth while fostering a sustainable environment for the $RACE ecosystem. Decentralization as the Foundation Race to a Billion’s decentralized structure, which eliminates the need for centralized monitoring, is its fundamental component. By using smart contracts for crucial procedures like event creation, prediction submissions, and results processing, this framework guarantees equity, security, and transparency. Because all platform operations are carried out on-chain, participants’ trust is increased by ensuring data accessibility and integrity. The dependability and immutability of blockchain technology set Race to a Billion apart from conventional prediction systems, fostering an ecosystem that places a premium on user trust and operational transparency. Security, Transparency, and Compliance The platform prioritizes user trust through its commitment to security and transparency. All prediction activities are conducted on-chain, ensuring that data is immutable and accessible to participants. Regular smart contract audits are conducted to maintain reliability and address potential vulnerabilities proactively. By adhering to blockchain best practices, Race to a Billion navigates the regulatory landscape effectively. The decentralized nature of the platform helps it avoid the complexities of traditional betting regulations, further enhancing its appeal to users seeking a secure and transparent prediction gaming experience. Presale: An Opportunity to Get In Early The Race to a Billion presale has become a focal point for early adopters, offering a unique chance to secure $RACE tokens at an attractive price of $0.00821. With over $219,000 raised so far, the presale phase reflects significant interest and trust from the crypto community. Participants can acquire $RACE tokens using a variety of payment options, including ETH, BNB, USDT, and even traditional payment methods like bank cards. This accessibility ensures that the presale appeals to a broad audience, allowing more users to participate in the Race to a Billion ecosystem. In addition to offering participants a low-cost entry point, the presale stage puts them in a position to gain from the platform’s expansion and potential benefits.

By selecting Miran, Trump is bringing experienced leadership back to Washington to help shape economic policy. “Steve will work with the rest of my Economic Team to deliver a Great Economic Boom that lifts up all Americans,” Trump said in a Truth Social post on Sunday. Miran has openly criticized the Biden administration, specifically targeting Fed Chair Jerome Powell. He condemned Powell for calling for more aggressive fiscal and monetary stimulus in Oct. 2020, just a month before the election, to boost the economic recovery during the pandemic. Stephen Miran to Help Craft Trump’s Vision for a Booming Economy The White House Council of Economic Advisers is a three-member team. It advises the president on economic policy. Miran will guide Trump on policy matters and be a key spokesperson to promote those decisions. He will provide insights and recommendations to shape the administration’s economic agenda. His work will help achieve its broader goals. Currently a senior strategist at hedge fund Hudson Bay Capital Management, Miran said he was honored to be chosen. “I look forward to working to help implement the President’s policy agenda to create a booming, noninflationary economy that brings prosperity to all Americans!” he posted on X.

Last month, Trump named Kevin Hassett as chair of the National Economic Council. And he nominated Paul Atkins to replace Gary Gensler as SEC Chair. Miran Sees Crypto as Catalyst for Prosperity Under Trump’s Agenda The crypto community has shown strong support for Miran, including Michael Saylor, executive chairman of MicroStrategy. In a recent interview with The Bitcoin Layer , Miran criticized the current financial regulatory framework, calling it overly restrictive and a barrier to financial institutions. He also pointed out the importance of innovation for economic growth, highlighting cryptocurrency’s potential role. “I think crypto will have a big role in innovation and ushering in a Trump administration economic boom,” he said in the interview.

37991372,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52907,1734928697,Projected Timeline For Dogecoin (DOGE) to Hit $10,"Dogecoin’s recent price movements have reignited discussions about its potential, with market analyst Dima James Potts projecting a significant surge to $10 within the current bull market cycle. Potts outlined his predictions, supported by historical data and current market trends while providing a clear timeline for when this milestone could be achieved. Market Performance and Outlook The meme-inspired cryptocurrency has shown strong recovery signs following a brief dip to a six-week low of $0.26216 on December 20. The token rebounded to close above $0.31, maintaining its upward momentum with an increase to $0.3226 as of the latest update . This steady recovery underscores growing confidence in the asset’s long-term potential among investors and analysts. Dima James Potts has set a minimum price target of $10 for the asset during this bull market cycle. According to Potts, Dogecoin’s performance aligns with broader market trends, where major cryptocurrencies often surpass their previous cycle highs during the fourth year of a bull run. For the token, this would mean exceeding its all-time high of $0.73995, achieved in 2021. Historical Trends Support Bullish Predictions Potts emphasized that the token has consistently outperformed its third-year performance during prior bull cycles. He highlighted that the cryptocurrency recorded gains of 72.37% in 2016 and 114.86% in 2020. However, the token’s growth in 2024 has already surpassed these figures, with an impressive 232.87% increase. Based on his analysis, Potts expects Dogecoin to close in 2024 at approximately $0.31. He projects the cryptocurrency will reach $10 in the coming years, with his base case targeting this milestone by 2025. Remarkably, his most optimistic scenario envisions the token soaring to $80, although this remains a speculative estimate. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Potts has provided a specific timeline for when Dogecoin could achieve the $10 target. According to his analysis, this milestone is expected between February 11 and May 7, 2025. He attributes this potential growth to the cyclical nature of the cryptocurrency market and predicts the digital asset to peak alongside Bitcoin during the latter’s first cycle top next year. Potts also cited increasing adoption and technological advancements as key drivers of Dogecoin’s anticipated rally. The cryptocurrency gained significant attention in November following the establishment of the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.), further boosting its visibility and market presence. Other Analysts Share Similar Predictions Potts is not alone in predicting Dogecoin’s rise to $10. Analyst Ali Marinez has also forecasted similar growth, referencing Dogecoin’s movement within an ascending triangle pattern. Meanwhile, other sources, such as Changelly and ChatGPT, have speculated on the asset’s long-term potential. Changelly predicts the token will reach $10 by 2040, while ChatGPT provides a timeline between 2029 and 2034. Analysts and investors have focused on the asset’s potential to hit $10, with projections grounded in historical trends, market behavior, and technological developments. While the exact timeline and magnitude of growth remain uncertain, the cryptocurrency’s recent performance and positive outlook suggest it could achieve significant milestones in the coming years.

Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin launch and ETF prospects enhance XRP’s ecosystem and institutional appeal. Key 2025 price targets hinge on ETF approvals, with potential highs of $35 amid robust market sentiment. After a prolonged consolidation phase, XRP experienced a dramatic resurgence in late 2024, propelled by pivotal events reshaping the crypto landscape. The asset’s trajectory signals a promising outlook for 2025, with bullish momentum and potential catalysts lining up to push XRP to new heights. A Landmark Victory and Market Rebound XRP’s rally can be traced back to the favorable ruling in its SEC case by Judge Analisa Torres in August 2023. The court affirmed that XRP sales on exchanges weren’t securities, a monumental win for Ripple and the broader crypto market. While Ripple was fined $125 million for institutional sales deemed unregistered securities, the decision further clarified XRP’s regulatory status, setting the stage for its future.

37991032,https://coinpedia.org/?p=396236,1734928230,"Meme Index Simplifies Investing in Meme Coins, Offering a Curated Selection of Diverse Cryptos: Here’s How","The post Meme Index Simplifies Investing in Meme Coins, Offering a Curated Selection of Diverse Cryptos: Here’s How appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News People typically choose select cryptocurrencies when trading meme coins. For example, a meme coin investor might hold Shiba Inu in the hope that it will rise in value while neglecting Pepe, Dogwifhat, and some other top 10 meme tokens. However, with the Meme Index model, this is about to change. Users can now hold a meme coin basket, which gives them access to multiple cryptocurrencies at once without having to buy them one after the other. Meme index combines various meme coins into unique curated indexes. The innovative platform enables its users to unlock the explosive potential of meme coins while also having the flexibility to choose their risk levels. Meme Index allows users to participate in four meme coin baskets. These baskets vary based on their risk levels. There is the Meme Titan Index , which is filled with the top cryptocurrencies, especially the top 10 meme coins. The Meme Moonshot Index consists of meme coins that are about to challenge for a top 10 position. Many of these meme coins are already on centralized exchanges. We also have the Meme Midcap Index . The meme coins in this category are quite volatile, making this basket suitable for those who want to take on more risk. These tokens also have market capitalizations between $50 million and $250 million. This low market capitalization means that these coins could rise sharply and also fall very quickly, depending on market conditions. The Meme Frenzy Index is the last basket, designed for those who like to take significant risks. It contains the riskiest plays and is not for the faint-hearted. These cryptocurrencies can rise and fall very quickly, making them high-risk, high-reward tokens. Other Features of the Meme Index Platform The Meme Index platform gives its MEMEX token holders the opportunity to submit proposals and vote on them. This puts the future of the ecosystem in the hands of the platform users. The votes will also affect the types of coins included in the baskets, as users have the opportunity to vote on coins to add to a basket. The dynamic content of the baskets ensures that the project continues to meet the community’s needs. Users also can keep the baskets fresh by incorporating both established tokens and new contenders. The platform prioritizes security. All operations are fully decentralized, and all staking and governance functions are executed through audited smart contracts. As detailed in the whitepaper, the smart contracts will also undergo rigorous audits to ensure their safety and integrity. https://twitter.com/memecoin_index/status/1864383592182526132 MEMEX also allows users to stake their tokens from the presale for high APY. This requires them to lock their tokens in an investment pool to earn passive income from the beginning. Since MEMEX price will continue to increase at various stages of the presale, this means that those who buy early can enjoy a percentage increase on their purchases by just holding the tokens throughout the presale and doing nothing else. The staking rewards also add to the appeal and general benefits of buying early in the presale. 15% of the total supply of the MEMEX token will be distributed during the presale. 25% of the supply will service the staking pool and rewards. 20% will be used for marketing, including various PR efforts, digital media, social media, and billboards. Another 20% will go into community rewards and incentives to promote awareness about the token and attract more people. The last 20% will be used for treasury and governance, which is necessary for holding a token. It is important to have voting rights and access to the index. How to Buy the Meme Index (MEMEX) Token To buy the token , ensure that you have a compatible wallet. For desktop users, MetaMask is recommended; for mobile users, Trust Wallet is recommended. After this, ensure that you load your crypto wallet with the accepted cryptocurrency and then buy and stake the MEMEX tokens.

37990983,https://coinpedia.org/?p=396240,1734928091,XRP Price Prediction For December 23,"The post XRP Price Prediction For December 23 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ripple’s XRP is currently trading in red and is trading below the $2.25 mark. Majority of the top 10 coins are trading in red, including Bitcoin. XRP continues to trade sideways as it remains in a consolidation phase. This range-bound movement is expected to exist as the market works through a correction. Here’s an update on the important price levels to monitor for XRP in the coming days. Key Support Levels XRP is currently facing support between $2.24 and $2.21. This range is based on Fibonacci retracement levels, but it is important to note that this support is relatively weak and could potentially be broken. The critical level to watch is the $1.94 swing low. As long as XRP stays above this level, the consolidation phase remains intact. However, if the price falls below $1.94, it could signal a shift toward lower support levels. Potential Lower Support Zone If XRP fails to hold above the $1.94 level, the next key support zone lies between $1.85 and $1.12. This could be the area where XRP finds strong buying interest if the current consolidation breaks down. Key Resistance Levels On the upside, XRP is approaching resistance near the $2.72 level. This price point is crucial because if XRP breaks above it, it could signal a potential rally toward previous highs. If XRP continues to hold its ground and eventually breaks out to the upside, this resistance level could be a significant target. Triangle Formation: Key Phases Currently, XRP may be in the D-wave of the triangle formation. This follows the previous A, B, and C waves, with the D-wave potentially developing now, followed by an E-wave, which should form a higher low. If the triangle is valid, XRP could breakout upward once the E-wave concludes, signaling a potential price rise.",NEUTRAL,XRP,ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-price-prediction-for-december-23/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

In fact, these tokens have notched a new record in terms of monthly volumes after attracting liquidity and institutional players across the region. MiCA Spurs Euro-Backed Stablecoin Adoption Monthly volumes for euro-backed stablecoins reached a multi-year high, surging to nearly €800 million in November. According to the latest report by research firm Kaiko and Netherlands-headquartered crypto exchange Bitvavo, this sharp increase can be largely attributed to Banking Circle’s EURI stablecoin, which gained significant traction after being listed on Binance. Other MiCA-compliant stablecoins, such as fintech firm Circle’s EURC and Société Générale’s EURCV, also contributed to the rise, collectively capturing 91% of the euro-backed stablecoin market share by the end of the year. Regulatory clarity provided by MiCA, which took effect in June, has been crucial in instilling investor confidence, driving liquidity, and attracting institutional players into the market. However, Tether’s decision to cease support for its euro-backed stablecoin, EURT, citing regulatory concerns, highlights ongoing challenges within the evolving framework. Explosive Growth in European Crypto Markets Zooming out, the broader European cryptocurrency market experienced transformative growth in 2024, with euro-denominated trade volumes hitting record highs. November alone saw weekly trade volumes surpass €12 billion, more than doubling October’s levels, as Bitcoin reached an all-time high above $100,000. The euro consolidated its position as the third most traded fiat currency in global crypto markets, behind the US dollar and the Korean won, and its share in Bitcoin-fiat trading surged from 3.6% to nearly 10%. This growth reflects improved regulatory conditions and the rising institutionalization of Bitcoin. European exchanges like Bitvavo, Kraken, and Coinbase played a key role, with Bitvavo leading in euro-denominated trading volumes, accounting for nearly 50% of the market. These platforms expanded their offerings significantly, listing over 331 new euro-denominated pairs in 2024 to meet growing demand. Liquidity in euro markets also improved markedly, with the combined 1% market depth for euro-denominated pairs doubling by November.

Announced Sunday, Bo Hines will onboard as executive director of the Presidential Council of Advisers for Digital Assets. Per Trump’s Truth Social post , Hines will report to the new ‘Crypto Czar’ pick, David Sacks. On December 5, Trump picked David to head the AI and Crypto sectors , calling them two “critical areas to the future of American Competitiveness.” Bo Hines, a graduate of Yale University and Wake Forest University Law School, played football for NC State and Yale. He once ran for a Republican seat in the House of Representatives in 2022, but came up short. Trump wrote that both Bo Hines and David Sacks will build an environment for the crypto industry to flourish. “Bo will work with David to foster innovation and growth in the digital assets space while ensuring industry leaders have the resources they need to succeed.” Besides, Trump has announced the appointment of Sriram Krishnan to serve as Senior Policy Advisor for Artificial Intelligence. Further, Trump has picked Michael Kratsios to lead tech policy at the White House. Joining Kratsios, Lynne Parker, Kratsios’ former deputy, will help in shaping crypto policy. In a response post on X, Bo Hines thanked Trump, calling his appointment to serve in the next administration the “honor of a lifetime.” “I am thrilled to work alongside the brilliant David Sacks to ensure that this industry will thrive and remain a cornerstone of our Nation’s technological advancement.” Thank you, Mr. President!

The price is now trading below $2.30 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.25 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might continue to move down if it stays below the $2.30 resistance. XRP Price Faces Resistance At $2.40 XRP price started a fresh increase from the $2.00 support level, unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum . However, the bears were active near the $2.38 and $2.40 levels. A high was formed at $2.38 and the price started a fresh decline. There was a move below the $2.30 and $2.25 levels.

37990452,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=113321,1734926816,BNB to Close 2024 Strong? ATH Push Heats Up While Uniswap Faces Fresh Rivalry,"BNB to Close 2024 Strong? ATH Push Heats Up While Uniswap Faces Fresh Rivalry BNB and Uniswap have turned in scintillating gains in December—but both have cooled off in a big way as December comes to an end. Nevertheless, their respective December runs have been nothing short of a success after a new BNB ATH was minted at $793 and Uniswap price action resulted in a solid 32% gain in the past month. However, the smart money is already on to the next big crypto—and they’re buying in big to the best presale left on the board this year with the launch of cross-chain DeFi protocol Lunex Network . Here’s why. Cross-chain DeFi protocol Lunex offering big-time gains in 2025 The future of crypto is multi-chain. And one new presale investment opportunity offers way better upside than BNB and Uniswap—even with new BNB ATH and strong Uniswap price action. Low caps, after all, offer significantly greater potential to skyrocket in value than big caps—and that’s exactly what newcomer cross-chain DeFi protocol Lunex Network brings to the table with its presale. Lunex enables users to seamlessly bridge, sell, and swap over 50,000 trading pairs across 40 blockchains, simplifying the user experience across the board with its hybrid model. Through its Lunex Wallet, users can conduct complex trades while maintaining complete control of their digital assets without having to connect to third-party apps that expose their digital assets to fraud. Lunex users will be able to leverage its self-custodial wallet for the most economical cross-chain swaps through its liquidity aggregator partners, while its native token $LNEX can be staked directly through the self-custodial wallet for passive income. Given its ability to onboard new users into the DeFi fold, $LNEX could be in for a major pump. That makes its presale launch one of the best investment opportunities as the year draws to an end. New BNB ATH and robust Uniswap price action hints at strong finish Not too long ago, BNB holders were ecstatic after a new BNB ATH of $793 was hit at the beginning of December. But the BNB ATH train hasn’t stopped yet. Even as prices have come back down to earth at the $680 range, the Binance-adjacent L1 protocol is still up 4% on the month. It was all just a matter of time before traders cashed in on the BNB ATH. On-chain volume suggests another strong finish for BNB to close out the year. Nothing ever goes up in a straight line forever, but a BNB ATH retest is most definitely well within the cards in 2025. Uniswap price has followed the same trajectory. Uniswap notably pumped hard throughout November and December, with Uniswap prices following Ethereum’s rise to $4000. As Ethereum pulled back to $3300, so has Uniswap. Uniswap is down 32.5% in the third week of December, trading at the $11 range. If Ethereum pumps and retests its ATH in 2025, holders can expect Uniswap to pump along with it. Conclusion BNB and Uniswap have pumped in 2024, and traders have already taken profit. While a strong finish could still be in the cards, the risk to reward ratio isn’t worth it. The smart money is favoring new crypto projects that haven’t mooned yet—making Lunex an infinitely superior investment prospect for investors looking for real gains in 2025.

Major world powers and politicians may be investing and holding BTC, but bitcoin cash is aiming to expand and follow through on Satoshi Nakamoto’s original vision: money for anyone, able to scale and work for low fees. While Blackrock bros continue to toot their Trump-ets about a compromised, NGU coin, and MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor unbelievably posts vids that say there’s “no guarantee” bitcoin’s 21 million supply cap won’t be changed (destroying the currency’s soundness), development on BCH pushes forward in determined, relative silence — but not without enthusiasm. After all, permissionless money for the world is just as exciting as when Satoshi Nakamoto initially floated the radical idea back in 2008. And let’s make no mistake: it’s always been about payments , whether one likes it or not. And that fact has, of course, resulted in a historical schism in the Bitcoin community, and created a hard fork. On one side, the Saylor/Blackrock camp saying Bitcoin is not a currency but just a kind of digital property, and on the other, those that understand the whitepaper. A tweet from X user Unstoppable Cash citing the Bitcoin whitepaper. Still, even for those on board with the purely peer-to-peer (P2P) version of electronic cash that doesn’t require any financial institution, 2nd layer network, or deep pockets for heavenly fees , keeping up with bitcoin cash upgrades that have preserved the pseudonymous Nakamoto’s vision can be tough, especially in an online sea of grift-y, Kiyosaki fear-mongering posts and internet trolls trying to mock anyone who still wants to actually buy something with the stuff. Not everyone is in the market for a Lambo, by the way, or is transferring hundreds of thousands of dollars overseas. Some folks can barely afford shoes, and Bitcoin was supposed to be about helping them as well. Some folks want to buy a coffee, a beer, or a new winter jacket with crypto. Minisatoshi’s Upgrade History and Fork Map Luckily, BCH community member minisatoshi has an excellent resource at the ready for anyone who wants to follow the history of bitcoin cash upgrades. And that’s not all — there’s also an epic and fairly exhaustive BTC fork chart for crypto historians comparing BTC to BCH. Minisatoshi’s timeline starts with Bitcoin’s Genesis Block and goes from there, right up to the present era. So whether one is a fan of BCH, an absolute hater, or anything in between, minisatoshi’s resources provide a unique glimpse into the trajectory of the most groundbreaking economic concept to emerge in modern history. The Bitcoin Cash upgrade timeline was released relatively recently and comes ahead of the approaching May 2025 upgrade for the network, which will bring the “VM Limits” and “BigInts” changes that aim to streamline and enhance BCH’s relatively new UTXO (unspent transaction output) smart contract capabilities.

Trump Fires Powell (TRUMPPOW), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPOW is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Fires Powell can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Fires Powell could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Fires Powell launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Fires Powell on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Fires Powell by entering its contract address – FWmVybuoRxJ79ZDHJ3Y8efeYsHsKL4qMNwJP8rCDsfmB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPOW.

While Dogecoin continues to hold its ground as a classic in the meme coin universe, BTFD Coin has stolen the spotlight with a jaw-dropping presale performance. In its first month, it raised over $4.3 million and captured the attention of over 6,300 holders. Meanwhile, Pepe Coin is carving its niche by combining gaming with blockchain technology, taking meme coin innovation to uncharted territories. Meme coins have always been about more than laughs—they’re a cultural phenomenon. Ever since Dogecoin’s meteoric rise, they’ve turned casual investors into millionaires and transformed internet humour into hard cash. Over time, these quirky tokens have evolved into powerful financial assets. Leading the pack now is BTFD Coin, a project that combines entertainment, utility, and massive return potential with its play-to-earn (P2E) game, staking rewards, and referral program. With a thriving community rallying behind it, BTFD is shaping up to be the next big thing in the meme coin universe. Buy The Dip Now There’s never been a better time to invest in innovative projects like these. History has shown that economic downturns can create incredible opportunities for those who take bold steps. During the global crash of 1973, savvy investors turned financial chaos into life-changing wealth. Today, BTFD—short for “Buy The F***ing Dip”—is urging investors to do just that. With its presale in Stage 12 at $0.000064 per coin, BTFD is an unmissable opportunity to get in early on a project with analysts predicting exponential growth. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin with Real Utility BTFD Coin has been making waves for all the right reasons. Its presale success is staggering, with over $4.3 million raised and 57 billion coins sold to more than 6,300 holders. Currently priced at $0.000064 in Stage 12, BTFD offers an 837.5% ROI opportunity when it lists at $0.0006 after the presale. What makes it stand out isn’t just its financial promise—it’s the ecosystem behind it. Unlike other meme coins, $BTFD is more than hype. It brings a robust platform that combines fun and functionality. The P2E game isn’t just a gimmick; it’s an immersive experience where players can earn rewards while enjoying the gameplay. Staking rewards add a layer of incentive for long-term holders, while the referral program strengthens community ties by rewarding participants for spreading the word. The numbers speak volumes. Imagine investing $50,000 at the Stage 7 price of $0.000064. That would bag you 781,250,000 BTFD Coins. By the time the coin lists at $0.0006, that investment would skyrocket to $468,750. With only a few stages left in the 16-stage presale, the window to secure such returns is closing fast. Dogecoin: The OG of Meme Coins Dogecoin has always been the king of meme coins, and for good reason. Born as a joke in 2013, it grew into a cultural icon that turned “Doge” the Shiba Inu into a global sensation. While its journey has had ups and downs, Dogecoin remains a reliable name in the crypto world, backed by an active community and widespread recognition. Dogecoin’s strength lies in its simplicity and popularity. It’s the coin that introduced millions to cryptocurrency, proving that investing can be fun and accessible. Over the years, it has gained endorsements from high-profile figures like Elon Musk, which have kept its momentum alive. But Dogecoin’s appeal isn’t just about nostalgia—it’s about consistency. It continues to serve as a gateway for new investors and a favourite among seasoned traders. However, compared to newer projects like BTFD Coin, Dogecoin lacks the cutting-edge features that today’s investors crave. It doesn’t have a P2E game, staking rewards, or referral programs, which are becoming the norm in the meme coin ecosystem. While Dogecoin remains a solid choice for stability, those looking for massive return potential may find newer coins more appealing. Pepe Coin: Where Gaming Meets Blockchain Pepe Coin is redefining what a meme coin can be by bridging the gap between gaming and blockchain technology. Inspired by the internet’s beloved Pepe the Frog, this project taps into nostalgia while offering something fresh—a gaming platform that allows players to earn rewards in crypto. It’s like combining your favourite pastime with an investment opportunity, and who wouldn’t want that? What makes Pepe Coin unique is its focus on community-driven gameplay. Players can compete, earn, and trade assets, all while being part of a vibrant and passionate community. The integration of blockchain ensures transparency and fairness, giving players confidence in their rewards. It’s a bold move that positions Pepe Coin as a serious contender in the meme coin space. While Pepe Coin is still finding its footing, its innovative approach to gaming has captured the imagination of investors and gamers alike. It’s a riskier bet compared to established names like Dogecoin or promising projects like BTFD Coin, but the potential upside is huge. If you’re someone who loves gaming and crypto, Pepe Coin might just hit the sweet spot. How to Join the BTFD Coin Presale Jumping into the BTFD Coin presale is easier than ordering a flat white at your local café. First, head to the BTFD presale page .

37990300,https://thecoinrise.com/achieve-your-investment-milestones-the-best-coins-to-invest-in-this-week-qubetics-polygon-and-algorand/,1734923717,"Achieve Your Investment Milestones: The Best Coins to Invest in This Week – Qubetics, Polygon, and Algorand","Cryptocurrency has come a long way since its experimental days, evolving into a powerhouse for alternative investments. In today’s market, savvy investors are no longer asking if crypto is worth the leap but rather, which coins are worth their money this week ? If you’re on the hunt for the best coins to invest in this week, the crypto scene has three standouts: Qubetics (TICS ), Polygon, and Algorand. These projects have earned their stripes in different ways, and they’re reshaping what financial independence and decentralised tech really mean. The crypto world is buzzing right now, and one name that keeps popping up in conversations is Qubetics (TICS). From its innovative Decentralized VPN technology to an insane presale run with record-breaking numbers, Qubetics is emerging as the next big thing. And while Polygon and Algorand have their own claim to fame, Qubetics seems to be taking centre stage, especially for those looking for high-growth potential in their crypto portfolios. But what makes these projects shine? Why are analysts and crypto enthusiasts dubbing them the best coins to invest in this week? Let’s dive in. Qubetics ($TICS): The New Kid with a Decentralised VPN Revolution If you’ve been tracking crypto presales, you’ve already heard about Qubetics. It’s smashing milestones faster than a meme coin goes viral, and the numbers don’t lie. Currently in its 13th presale stage, Qubetics has sold over 367 million $TICS tokens to more than 11,300 holders, raising a whopping $7.5 million so far. At $0.0342 per token, it’s still affordable, but here’s the kicker: the price is set to jump by 10% this weekend. Now, the big question: Why all the hype around Qubetics?The excitement surrounding Qubetics stems from its innovative approach to online privacy through its decentralized VPN technology. Unlike traditional VPNs that depend on centralized servers, which can be unreliable and untrustworthy, Qubetics leverages blockchain to enhance security, privacy, and efficiency. This decentralized model distributes the workload across thousands of nodes, making it nearly impossible for hackers or governments to monitor users’ online activities. For businesses, this means secure exchanges of sensitive data within remote teams, ensuring that company secrets remain confidential. Professionals, particularly digital nomads, can access geo-restricted content and use public Wi-Fi without worrying about security breaches. Individuals benefit from enhanced privacy while shopping or streaming, knowing their data is protected. Additionally, Qubetics’ decentralized VPN is more cost-effective than many leading VPN services. Analysts are optimistic about Qubetics, forecasting significant returns for investors. Predictions suggest that by the end of the presale, the price of $TICS could reach $0.25, offering a 630% return on investment (ROI). Following the presale, projections rise to $1, translating to a staggering 2,820% ROI. Long-term estimates post-mainnet launch indicate a price range of $5 to $15, with potential ROIs soaring to an astonishing 43,711%.If you invested $20,000 at today’s presale price of $0.0342, you’d snag roughly 584,795 tokens . By the time $TICS reaches $15, your $20k would balloon to $8.77 million . Unreal, right? Polygon: The Layer-2 Darling with Real-World Utility Polygon has cemented itself as a household name in the crypto world. Known for its scalability solutions, it acts as a Layer-2 protocol for Ethereum, reducing transaction fees and increasing processing speeds. If Ethereum is the highway, Polygon is the express lane that keeps traffic flowing smoothly. What makes Polygon one of the best coins to invest in this week is its real-world application. Major brands like Reddit and Starbucks have integrated Polygon into their ecosystems, showing the crypto world that scalability is key to mass adoption. Polygon is beloved by developers and investors alike because it bridges the gap between Ethereum’s decentralised power and user-friendly performance. With big players like Disney joining its Web3 accelerator programme, Polygon’s reputation continues to skyrocket. Let’s not forget its NFT and gaming roots. From powering decentralised marketplaces to enabling metaverse platforms, Polygon is setting the stage for the future of crypto-based economies. While it’s not riding the presale wave like Qubetics, Polygon’s steady growth makes it a safe bet for those who prefer a less volatile investment. Its native token, MATIC, is still a favourite among long-term investors, offering both stability and potential upside. Algorand: The Green Blockchain If crypto were a high school, Algorand would be the eco-friendly, straight-A student. Known for its carbon-neutral blockchain, Algorand has been championing sustainability long before it was cool. Algorand isn’t just green; it’s wicked fast and incredibly secure. Its Pure Proof-of-Stake (PPoS) mechanism eliminates the energy-guzzling processes of traditional blockchains. That makes it a darling for ESG-conscious investors. It’s also carving out a niche in decentralised finance (DeFi). With partnerships ranging from central banks to cutting-edge startups, Algorand is proving that you can be sustainable and scalable at the same time. Absolutely. While its gains might not be as explosive as Qubetics’ presale predictions, Algorand offers a reliable option for those looking to balance risk and reward. Why These Three Coins Dominate the Week Whether it’s Qubetics with its game-changing decentralised VPN tech, Polygon’s scalability solutions, or Algorand’s green innovations, these projects represent the best of what crypto has to offer right now. Looking to make a move? Don’t sleep on Qubetics. With its presale heating up and token prices poised to rise soon, this is your chance to get in before the wave. Conclusion: The Time to Invest Is Now Crypto isn’t just an alternative investment anymore—it’s a must-have in any modern portfolio. And when it comes to the best coins to invest in this week, Qubetics, Polygon, and Algorand are leading the charge. If you’ve been on the sidelines waiting for the perfect moment to dive in, this is it. Qubetics presale is offering life-changing ROI potential and provide the stability and proven track record seasoned investors love. So, are you ready to join the future of finance? Don’t wait too long—crypto doesn’t pause for anyone. Grab your slice of Qubetics presale now and ride the wave before it’s too late.

37997409,https://cryptonews.com/?p=321830,1734922800,Chivo Architect Says It’s Time to Shut Down El Salvador Bitcoin Wallet,"One of the architects of El Salvador’s state-run Chivo crypto walle t has claimed the government should shut the app down. In an interview with the Spanish-language media outlet Criptonoticias , Arley Lozano (aka Vakano) said: “The most sensible thing to do would be to shut down the Chivo Wallet due to the controversy it has generated since its launch.” Chivo Regrets? Lozano is the Co-Founder of the Panda Exchange and also directed the team that created the Chivo Wallet for the El Salvador government. El Salvador keeps betting on Bitcoin, pledging to expand its holdings despite IMF warnings about crypto risks. #Bitcoin #ElSalvador https://t.co/FXIO11iYL0 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 20, 2024 Chivo was the world’s first government-run Bitcoin (BTC) wallet, and launched to much acclaim in September 2021. In a bid to drive up adoption, the state gave Salvadoran users a “golden hello” of $30 in BTC when they opened a Chivo wallet . However, this led to widespread accusations of identity theft, fraud, and reports of Chivo-related bugs that saw accounts frozen. Many people claimed that they only downloaded the app to receive the $30 handout, which they immediately traded for fiat. The app’s user base declined sharply after an initial rush, and it has been beset with controversy ever since. Lozano suggested that “saying goodbye” to the Bitcoin wallet would be a logical “part of El Salvador’s evolution.” “Many users have experienced problems with their accounts. And others have taken advantage of the Bitcoin wallet to commit fraud. I believe that it is for this reason that the International Monetary Fund asked El Salvador to distance itself from the app.” Arley Lozano El Salvador reached a deal with the International Monetary Fund after four years of negotiations that were strained by the country’s adoption of Bitcoin as a legal tender https://t.co/fsWvAxtybp — Bloomberg (@business) December 18, 2024 Government to Make Privatization Decision Lozano was speaking in the wake of the Salvadoran government’s decision to privatize or discontinue the Chivo Wallet. The government says that “service” would not be interrupted during the process if Chivo was sold off. But Lozano said this decision would be a “mistake.” “It [would be] a mistake because, ultimately, we all have access to technologies superior to the Chivo Wallet, especially as we head into 2025. There are tools out there that have already been tested and work efficiently.” Lozano The expert added that the state’s decision would only “benefit the competition – companies that offer Bitcoin wallet services and that can now attract Salvadoran users.” He explained that he worked on the project with experts from the US-based firm Athena Bitcoin. However, Lozano opined that the team was ill-equipped to deal with Chivo. Lozano said that the problems with Chivo had already become apparent by December 2021. He suggested that this was the point when the government should have said: “Let’s put an end to the Chivo Wallet and start again from scratch, with another team in charge.” The post Chivo Architect Says It’s Time to Shut Down El Salvador Bitcoin Wallet appeared first on Cryptonews .",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,,0,0,cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/chivo-architect-says-its-time-to-shut-down-el-salvador-bitcoin-wallet/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/37997409.jpeg
37988766,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=631357,1734922800,Cryptos with Upcoming Developments That Could Boost Prices Stay Ahead of the Curve,"In the ever-evolving cryptocurrency landscape, being ahead of the curve is crucial. Early awareness of key developments, such as technical updates, strategic partnerships, and ecosystem expansions, can lead to significant returns. One exciting opportunity to keep on your radar is the Lightchain AI Presale , a promising project combining AI integration and blockchain technology. Instead of reacting to price surges after the news breaks, savvy investors focus on projects with strong roadmaps and impactful milestones. From advanced privacy features to enhanced cross-chain functionality, these innovations have the potential to bring undervalued tokens into the spotlight. Below, we explore a few emerging cryptos that could see substantial price growth in the near future, helping you capitalize on these opportunities. Manta Network (MANTA) Privacy Upgrades Fueling DeFi Innovation As secrecy gets more and more key for both big groups and small buyers in crypto, Manta Network shines as a chief in the area. Its privacy-centered DeFi tools, driven by zero-knowledge proof, make sure that user data and plans stay secret. Manta is growing its system by joining with different DeFi platforms, decentralized ex͏change (DEX), and lending rules. These partnerships aim to widen the network’s scope enabling private and safe deals across many platforms. Also, Manta is improving its secrecy traits with the creation of Universal Circuits 2.0 which will give builders a library of ready-made zero-knowledge circuits making it easier to add privacy traits into current apps. With rules checks growing, secrecy answers like Manta are becoming more key. These updates could bring in funds looking for safe DeFi choices possibly raising MANTA’s token cost. Injective (INJ) Cross-Chain Growth and Beyond Injective is making waves with its focus on cross-chain interoperability, enabling seamless asset transfers and trading. By providing traders with access to multiple blockchains without the need to navigate separate platforms, Injective saves time and reduces complexity. The network is integrating Layer 2 solutions to improve transaction speeds and lower costs, with a notable collaboration with Arbitrum to build interoperable EVM infrastructure for cross-chain compatibility. Injective’s ecosystem is also growing with the addition of new decentralized applications (dApps), such as Helix, which offers Trading Bots and Pre-Launch Futures, and Neptune Finance with its peer-to-peer lending testnet. These developments enhance the utility of the INJ token and drive ecosystem growth. Interoperability remains a top priority for developers and traders alike, and advancements in this area significantly boost INJ’s market appeal. Lightchain AI (LCAI) Merging AI with Blockchain for Real-World Impact Lightchain AI (LCAI) combines artificial intelligence with blockchain technology, creating a platform designed to support AI-powered decentralized applications (dApps). Its Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) and Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism allow developers to build solutions that address real-world challenges in industries like healthcare, finance, and logistics. The roadmap for LCAI includes a Testnet Rollout in December 2024 and a Mainnet Launch in January 2025, critical milestones for validating the platform’s technology and driving interest from developers and investors. Strategic partnerships with AI developers , enterprises, and other blockchain platforms aim to drive adoption and integrate AI across various sectors. With a presale price of just $0.003 and significant near-term milestones, LCAI’s technological advancements position it for rapid growth. Casper (CSPR) Enterprise-Grade Improvements and Upgrades Casper is designed for enterprise-grade scalability, adaptability, and upgradability, making it particularly attractive to businesses seeking reliable blockchain solutions. With a focus on predictable performance, Casper is well-suited for professional environments hesitant to adopt less proven blockchains. The network is refining its protocol efficiency and actively engaging with corporate clients, with each successful integration potentially increasing demand for the CSPR token. Additionally, Casper is introducing developer-friendly tools to streamline building on its platform, encouraging ecosystem growth and long-term token appreciation. As the corporate world gradually embraces blockchain technology, Casper’s advancements strengthen its reputation as a reliable solution for professional-grade applications, paving the way for steady token price improvements. Why Lightchain AI (LCAI) Presale Stands Out as an Opportunity The Lightchain AI (LCAI) Presale is generating significant buzz in the crypto community, positioning itself as a standout opportunity for early investors. Leveraging cutting-edge AI-powered blockchain solutions, LCAI aims to redefine efficiency and scalability in decentralized ecosystems. Priced at an accessible $0.003, the presale offers investors an entry point into a project that combines innovative technology with practical use cases across industries. What sets LCAI apart is its focus on ultra-fast transaction speeds and energy-efficient operations, appealing to both developers and eco-conscious investors. The ongoing presale provides a chance to capitalize on a promising project before potential market surges. For those seeking a blend of technological innovation and financial potential, the LCAI presale at Lightchain.ai offers a unique opportunity to secure a foothold in the future of blockchain technology.

Daddy Pepe (DADDPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 11,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DADDPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Daddy Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Daddy Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Daddy Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Daddy Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Daddy Pepe by entering its contract address – 9UFnMabUe7wecdEEzAYPoQPZiuTJ1hTFpNz6qtsiB3FA – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DADDPEPE.

37988117,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=632089,1734921318,Securitize proposes using BlackRock’s BUIDL token to back Frax USD stablecoin,"Securitize is brokering a deal for BlackRock’s BUIDL token to be integrated as collateral for the soon-to-be-released Frax USD stablecoin. The Frax improvement proposal is undergoing a governance process; should it pass, BUIDL will be part of Frax. Securitize is the brokerage firm for the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund and its BUIDL token. The firm developed the Frax Finance governance proposal. Part of the proposal mentions. “In addition to providing Frax USD utility, relative safety, and convenience, Frax USD can significantly reduce counterparty risk for its reserves by working with BlackRock.” Although the proposal must undergo a community vote, the prospects are good for BUIDL. The proposal has received public support, with one response from alexd3366 reading: I wholeheartedly support this proposal! As a proud investor and big believer in the project’s potential, I’ve witnessed the dedication and expertise that’s gone into shaping this initiative. ~ alexd336 6 BlackRock’s BUIDL is making a niche in the collateral market The Frax stablecoin proposal is not the first for BUIDL. If it goes through, it will join other stablecoins, including Ethena’s USDtb, which works with BUIDL token as a collateral asset. BUIDL has over $530 million worth of assets under management, most in short-term US treasury bills. Securize made the strategic move as Frax’s team is exploring rebranding its core stablecoin to Frax USD (frxUSD). The plans for rebranding are described in another governance proposal , which also talks of introducing Staked Frax USD (sfrxUSD) as a yield-bearing counterpart. The proposal clarifies that the frxUSD token will facilitate direct conversions into fiat currency while working with Paxos. New mint-redeem system, motivation for approval Frax Finance has put in place a new mint-redeem system, known as enshrined custodians, to accompany the stablecoin launch. Through the mint-redeem system, users will have mint-redeem rights to frxUSD if governance allows their assets to back the frxUSD. If BlacRock’s proposal wins, any authentic user can mint 1 BUIDL and send it to the on-chain custodian to receive a frxUSD. While BlackRock’s proposal receives a fair share of public support, it isn’t the only one that can authorize a proposal. Superstate, a competing tokenized fund platform, submitted two governance proposals .

That’s the promise of aevatar intelligence, a cloud-native AI agent framework built for everyone, from beginners to seasoned developers. And here’s the kicker: it will be open-source. The Vision Behind aevatar Intelligence At the heart of aevatar intelligence lies aelf’s commitment to breaking down barriers. AI and blockchain technology are often seen as two separate realms, each with its own steep learning curve. But aelf believes the magic happens when you bring the two together—and make it accessible to everyone. “aevatar intelligence represents a turning point in the integration of artificial intelligence and blockchain technologies for aelf,” said Brian Liang, COO of aelf. “In developing this framework, we set out a mission to eliminate complexity, unite ecosystems, and make AI accessible to everyone. Launching aevatar intelligence will transform how AI agents work and interact with each other, and unlock new opportunities on the Web3 frontier.” And it’s not just talk. The framework is powered by multiple large-language models (LLMs), giving users access to both general-purpose AI and niche models tailored to specific industries. Whether you’re in asset management, gaming, or decentralized trading, aevatar intelligence has you covered. Building AI Agents with No Limits (and No Code) So how does it work? aevatar intelligence lets users create and deploy AI agents without needing to dive into complicated code.

The AI pump pad is set to launch in early January 2025, taking a fair-launch approach to ensure that AI agents and token creation are accessible to everyone. It’s a glimpse of what’s possible when AI and blockchain technologies collide in the most creative ways. What’s Next for aelf and aevatar Intelligence? aevatar intelligence isn’t just a tool—it’s a vision for the future of Web3. By combining AI’s limitless potential with blockchain’s decentralized power, aelf is creating an environment where innovation knows no bounds.

Why Qubetics Is December 2024’s Most Promising Crypto Investment,"Ever kick yourself for not jumping on Theta’s bandwagon back in the day? You’re not alone. Plenty of folks watched from the sidelines as Theta’s value shot up, turning early believers into big winners. But here’s the kicker: opportunities like that don’t come around often. Or do they? Enter Qubetics ($TICS) , the fresh face in the crypto world that’s got everyone talking. If you missed the Theta train, this might just be your second chance. Theta made waves by shaking up video streaming, but it had its hiccups—think high fees and clunky user experiences. Qubetics is stepping up to tackle these issues head-on. With its multi-chain wallet and real-world payment integrations, it’s aiming to make crypto as easy to use as your everyday cash. Imagine paying for your morning coffee with crypto without breaking a sweat. That’s the kind of real-world problem Qubetics is looking to solve. Qubetics Could Be the Opportunity You Don’t Want to Miss Qubetics isn’t just another name in the crypto crowd; it’s carving out its own space with some seriously cool features. At the heart of it is the Qubetics Wallet —a non-custodial, open-source hub that puts you in the driver’s seat of your digital assets. No middlemen, no fuss. Plus, it’s rolling out on iOS, Android, and desktop, so you’ve got access wherever you are. But wait, there’s more. Qubetics is teaming up with big players like Visa and Mastercard to bring debit and virtual card options into the mix. That means you can spend your $TICS tokens just like regular money, whether you’re swiping your card or tapping your phone with Apple Pay or Google Pay. It’s all about making crypto fit seamlessly into your daily life. And for the tech-savvy out there, Qubetics is cooking up a decentralized VPN (dVPN) service and a tokenized asset marketplace. These additions are set to boost privacy and open up new investment avenues, making the Qubetics ecosystem even more robust. Now, let’s talk numbers. The Qubetics presale is in its 1 3th stage, with tokens priced at $0.0342. Each stage wraps up every Sunday at midnight, bumping the price up by 10%. So far, over $7.5 million has been raised, with more than 1 1,300 token holders and 367 million $TICS tokens sold. That’s some serious traction, and it hints at a promising future for Qubetics. Theta’s Journey from ICO to Today Theta’s story is one for the books. Back in January 2018, it launched its ICO with tokens priced at a mere $0.15. Fast forward to its peak on April 16, 2021, and Theta hit an all-time high of $15.72. That’s a jaw-dropping increase, turning a modest investment into a small fortune. citeturn0search8 Today, Theta is trading at around $2.28, which, despite being below its peak, still represents a significant gain from its ICO days. Early investors who held onto their tokens have seen substantial returns, showcasing the potential rewards of getting in on the ground floor of a promising project. Theta’s success wasn’t just about luck; it tapped into the booming demand for decentralized video streaming, offering a solution that resonated with both users and investors. Its journey from a $0.15 ICO to a multi-dollar valuation underscores the impact that innovative blockchain projects can have in the market. Wrapping Up: Don’t Let Qubetics Slip Through Your Fingers Missing out on Theta’s early days was a tough break, but here’s your shot at redemption. Qubetics is bringing a fresh approach to the crypto scene, focusing on real-world usability and user-friendly features. With its presale in full swing and a slew of innovative applications in the pipeline, it’s shaping up to be a compelling opportunity for both seasoned crypto enthusiasts and newcomers alike. The $TICS presale stages are flying by, each ending every Sunday at midnight with a 10% price hike. Jumping in now at $0.0342 could position you for potential gains as the project evolves. Don’t let this chance pass you by—consider diving into the Qubetics presale and becoming part of a project that’s aiming to redefine the crypto landscape.

37988065,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52875,1734918301,Best Altcoins to Invest in December 2024: Qubetics Sold Over 367M $TICS as Algorand Hits Highs and SEI Climbs the Crypto Ladder,"The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with activity as December 2024 unfolds. While seasoned investors are locking in gains, newcomers are looking for projects with explosive potential. The market is teeming with opportunities, and three projects stand out for their innovation, utility, and investment potential: Qubetics, Algorand, and SEI. Qubetics, a rising star in the blockchain world, is rewriting the rules of crypto presales with its $7 million success. Meanwhile, Algorand is scaling new heights with its robust blockchain architecture, and SEI is turning heads with its meteoric rise in market value. Each project offers a unique value proposition, making them some of the best altcoins to invest in December 2024. Qubetics: Redefining Blockchain Development with QubeQode IDE Qubetics is not just a blockchain platform; it’s an innovation powerhouse aimed at simplifying blockchain adoption for developers and businesses. With its user-friendly tools like the QubeQode IDE, Qubetics is removing the complexity of blockchain development and making it accessible to everyone. Qubetics is a ground-breaking Layer 1, Web3 aggregated blockchain. The Qubetics presale , now in its 13th stage, has already raised over $7.5 million, sold more than 367 million $TICS tokens, and attracted over 11,300 token holders. At $0.0342 per token, investors have limited time before the price jumps by 10% this weekend. Analysts are optimistic, predicting $TICS could reach $0.25 by the presale’s end, delivering a 630% ROI. Post-presale, forecasts suggest the token could hit $1 for a 2,820% ROI, with the potential to soar to $15 after the mainnet launch—a staggering 43,711% ROI. If you invested $6,000 today, your returns could grow to $43,841 at $0.25, $175,365 at $1, and an incredible $2,630,475 at $15. The QubeQode IDE is one of Qubetics’ standout features . This integrated development environment allows businesses and developers to create smart contracts and decentralised applications (dApps) without extensive coding expertise. Imagine a small business automating supply chain payments or a legal firm developing tamper-proof contracts—all without hiring expensive blockchain developers. The QubeQode IDE is democratising blockchain technology, making it one of the best altcoins to invest in December 2024. Algorand: A Blockchain for the Future Algorand has solidified its position as one of the most scalable and secure Layer-1 blockchains. Known for its innovative Pure Proof-of-Stake (PPoS) consensus mechanism, Algorand offers unparalleled speed, security, and decentralisation. Its ecosystem supports everything from DeFi platforms to tokenised assets, making it a versatile player in the crypto space. Recently, Algorand has experienced a significant price surge, reaching levels not seen in over two years. This growth is underpinned by robust on-chain metrics, including increased Open Interest (OI) and Total Value Locked (TVL), reflecting strong investor confidence. Algorand’s focus on providing enterprise-grade solutions has attracted partnerships and use cases across various industries, from finance to supply chain management. Imagine a financial institution using Algorand to settle cross-border payments in seconds or a healthcare provider ensuring patient data security with blockchain-backed systems. Algorand’s versatility and reliability make it a go-to option for businesses and developers, earning it a spot as one of the best altcoins to invest in December 2024. SEI: The New Contender on the Block SEI is making waves as one of the fastest-growing altcoins in the market. With its focus on providing a decentralised and scalable ecosystem, SEI is quickly climbing the ranks of notable cryptocurrencies. Its recent performance, including a doubling of value in November, showcases its potential to deliver massive returns. SEI’s market capitalisation has reached approximately $2.73 billion, making it the 55th-largest cryptocurrency. Analysts believe SEI could hit the $1 mark in 2024, especially as the altcoin market continues to rise. Its growth trajectory is bolstered by increasing adoption and a supportive community, making it an attractive investment option. SEI’s use cases range from decentralised trading platforms to scalable dApps, catering to both retail and institutional users. For example, a decentralised exchange built on SEI could offer lightning-fast transaction speeds and reduced fees, appealing to traders worldwide. Conclusion: Why Qubetics Stands Out Algorand and SEI are undoubtedly strong contenders in the cryptocurrency market, each excelling in their respective niches. Algorand’s focus on scalability and enterprise solutions makes it a cornerstone for blockchain innovation, while SEI’s rapid ascent showcases its potential to disrupt the market. However, Qubetics is the project that truly stands out. Its $7 million presale, combined with tools like the QubeQode IDE and groundbreaking Real World Asset Tokenisation, positions it as a leader in blockchain innovation. Whether you’re a developer, a business owner, or an investor, Qubetics offers something for everyone. The time to act is now. Visit Qubetics’ presale page today to secure your $TICS tokens before the price hike. With its ambitious roadmap and game-changing features, Qubetics isn’t just another blockchain—it’s the future of digital innovation.

37986592,https://nulltx.com/?p=136224,1734918246,Best Altcoins To Invest In Now: Qubetics Presale Sets New Standards As AAVE Nears $400 And SUI Integrates Bitcoin,"The crypto market in December 2024 is buzzing with fresh opportunities and transformative projects that promise massive returns. As new technologies and utilities redefine the blockchain landscape, projects like Qubetics, AAVE, and SUI are making waves. Qubetics is rewriting the rules of blockchain innovation, particularly with its $7.5 million presale and groundbreaking features. Meanwhile, AAVE is strengthening its position as a DeFi powerhouse with its recent price surge and ecosystem developments. At the same time, SUI is capturing attention by integrating Bitcoin functionality into its network, enhancing its appeal to developers and investors alike. With each project bringing something unique to the table, let’s explore why they’re the best altcoins to invest in now. Qubetics: Driving Innovation in Blockchain Technology Qubetics is a blockchain ecosystem designed to simplify and expand blockchain adoption. By tackling critical challenges like scalability, interoperability, and asset tokenisation, Qubetics is creating a comprehensive platform for businesses, developers, and everyday users. The $7M Presale Success The numbers speak for themselves. Currently in its 13th stage, the Qubetics presale has raised over $7.5 million, sold more than 367 million $TICS tokens, and on boarded over 11,300 holders. At $0.0342 per token, there’s a limited window to invest before the next 10% price hike this weekend. Analysts are optimistic about $TICS’ trajectory, predicting a price of $0.25 by the presale’s end, delivering a 630% ROI. Post-presale, the token is expected to hit $1, representing a 2,820% ROI, with projections of $15 after the mainnet launch—a jaw-dropping 43,711% ROI. For a $7,000 investment, this means potential returns of $50,732 at $0.25, $204,800 at $1, and a life-changing $3,072,000 at $15. The Power of QubeQode IDE The QubeQode IDE is a standout feature that simplifies blockchain development. Traditionally, creating smart contracts or decentralised applications required extensive programming skills. With QubeQode, developers of all levels can easily create, deploy, and manage their blockchain projects. Imagine a fintech startup automating cross-border payments or an artist tokenising their digital art collection—both without hiring a team of blockchain developers. QubeQode IDE is removing barriers and enabling more industries to embrace blockchain technology. Multi-Chain Wallet: Simplifying Digital Asset Management Qubetics’ Multi-Chain Wallet is another game-changer. This feature allows users to manage multiple cryptocurrencies across different blockchains seamlessly. For businesses, this eliminates the inefficiencies of juggling various wallets and platforms. A freelancer working with global clients could invoice Ethereum, Bitcoin, or stablecoins, all while maintaining one central wallet. This innovation not only makes digital asset management simpler but also more secure and user-friendly, appealing to both seasoned crypto enthusiasts and new users. Real World Asset Tokenisation Tokenising real-world assets is at the heart of Qubetics’ vision. By converting tangible assets like real estate, intellectual property, or commodities into digital tokens, Qubetics is opening up new investment opportunities and improving liquidity. Consider a real estate developer looking to raise funds by tokenising a luxury apartment complex. Investors from around the world can now own fractional shares, enabling small-scale investors to participate in markets traditionally reserved for the wealthy. Qubetics is not just making investment more inclusive; it’s revolutionising asset ownership. AAVE: The DeFi Giant Nears $400 AAVE has long been a cornerstone of decentralised finance (DeFi), offering users a platform to lend, borrow, and earn interest on digital assets. Its adaptability and continuous innovation make it a mainstay in the crypto ecosystem. Recently, AAVE’s price has surged to nearly $400, representing a 420% increase from its April low. This bullish trend is supported by a rise in active addresses and strong on-chain metrics, reflecting heightened interest in the protocol. Beyond its price performance, AAVE’s utility in DeFi is unparalleled. Developers are leveraging AAVE’s flash loans for complex financial transactions, while users benefit from its flexible lending and borrowing options. As AAVE continues to evolve, it remains one of the best altcoins to invest in now. SUI: Bridging Bitcoin and DeFi SUI is quickly becoming a force to be reckoned with in the crypto world. Its recent integration of SatLayer brings Bitcoin functionality to the SUI network, allowing developers to secure decentralised applications with Bitcoin. The SUI ecosystem is thriving, with decentralised exchange volume exceeding $466 million in a single day. While a recent network outage temporarily affected its performance, SUI’s market cap has climbed to $2.73 billion, making it the 55th-largest cryptocurrency. By bridging the gap between Bitcoin and modern blockchain applications, SUI is positioning itself as one of the best altcoins to invest in now. Its focus on innovation and user engagement ensures its long-term relevance in the rapidly evolving crypto landscape. Take Away AAVE and SUI are undoubtedly impressive, each excelling in their respective niches. AAVE’s dominance in DeFi and SUI’s bold integration of Bitcoin functionality make them essential components of a diversified crypto portfolio. However, Qubetics is the project redefining what blockchain technology can achieve. With its $7 million presale success, innovative features like the Multi-Chain Wallet, and groundbreaking focus on Real World Asset Tokenisation, Qubetics is setting a new standard for the industry. The opportunity is now. Visit Qubetics’ presale page to secure your $TICS tokens before the price hike.

Musk the Manipulator (MUSKMANI), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKMANI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk the Manipulator can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk the Manipulator could become the next viral memecoin. Musk the Manipulator launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk the Manipulator on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk the Manipulator by entering its contract address – DZpfk5LaLrnP6vSFJnLSMAopUuTJGiFk7543rQxh4ids – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKMANI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/new-solana-memecoin-musk-the-manipulator-muskmani-will-skyrocket-over-14000-before-exchange-listings/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png
37986368,https://nulltx.com/?p=136211,1734917703,Final 2 Days of BlockDAG’s $1M Giveaway! Shiba Inu Whale Activity Rises & Polkadot Price Outlook Looks Positive,"People generally respond quickly to shifts in the crypto market, either by capitalizing on lower prices or by keeping up with new trends. This quick reaction is shown in the recent increase in Shiba Inu whale activity, with a significant movement of 2.79 trillion SHIB tokens valued at $76.48 million. Similarly, the Polkadot price outlook appears positive, with predictions of an increase to $30 following a breakout from a long-term downtrend. In this context, BlockDAG’s nearly concluded $1 million giveaway is gaining traction, providing an attractive chance for BlockDAG (BDAG) holders. By possessing $100 worth of BDAG, 50 fortunate individuals will win $20,000 each. This event is contributing to the success of BlockDAG’s $170.5 million presale, positioning it among the key crypto coins to watch currently. Shiba Inu Whale Activity Escalates with 2.79T SHIB Transferred Recent figures show a spike in Shiba Inu whale activity, with 2.79 trillion SHIB tokens moved, totaling $76.48 million. This represents a 41.39% rise in substantial transactions, suggesting a heightened interest from significant holders. Despite this increase, the price of SHIB is still struggling, decreasing by 3.49% to $0.00002736 over the last day. The trading volume has also seen a reduction of 18.25%, indicating a drop in overall market participation. Moreover, the token faces hurdles in surpassing a critical resistance level at $0.00003, crucial for any potential price recovery. Without a consistent positive outlook or broader market support, SHIB may face continued challenges. For now, it remains a crypto coin to watch, as its recovery hinges on overcoming these obstacles. Polkadot Price Outlook: Analysts Forecast $30 Polkadot is showing signs of recovery, with forecasts suggesting a possible rise to $30 after emerging from a prolonged bearish phase. This optimistic view follows a 150% surge from a price range of $4–$5, fueled by robust accumulation through its downturn. Yet, challenges remain. The current price is encountering resistance near the $9 mark, and failing to break through this barrier could restrict further advances. Market volatility also poses a risk to maintaining recent gains, casting uncertainty on continued growth. Despite these concerns, the Polkadot price outlook is still tentatively hopeful, with signs of stability as it tests its breakout zone. Final Days to Win Big with BlockDAG’s $1M Event BlockDAG is turning heads in the cryptocurrency market with its $1 million giveaway , where 50 lucky people could each win $20,000. To be eligible, one needs to own at least $100 worth of BDAG. The stakes are higher as participants can increase their chances by engaging in activities like referring friends and promoting the event on social media. With only three days remaining, time is quickly running out to take part in this opportunity. The event has also sparked a lot of interest in BlockDAG’s ongoing presale, which has already gathered a formidable $170.5 million, making it a hot topic in the crypto community. The price of BDAG has skyrocketed by 2240%, starting at $0.001 and reaching $0.0234 in the latest release, batch 26. This sharp increase has drawn significant attention, further enhancing the presale’s success. As the giveaway nears its end, more people are getting involved, seeing the potential for substantial rewards and the rising value of BDAG. With the presale moving swiftly and the $1 million prize drawing attention, BlockDAG’s presence in the market continues to grow. For those interested in joining and possibly winning part of this grand prize, now is the ideal time, especially with BDAG still being quite affordable. However, this opportunity might not last as the current batch is almost sold out, and the next batch will likely see a price hike. Key Crypto Coins to Keep an Eye On With Shiba Inu whale activity intensifying, marked by 2.79 trillion tokens being moved, and the Polkadot price outlook possibly climbing to $30, the crypto market is showing interesting shifts. Yet, BlockDAG stands out with its $1 million giveaway and rapid price increase. This giveaway is a chance for 50 individuals to win $20,000 each by simply holding $100 in BDAG, contributing to both the growth of its presale and increased market interest. With over $170.5 million raised and a remarkable 2240% increase in price, BlockDAG is quickly becoming one of the top crypto coins to watch now.

This announcement follows Nasdaq’s recent decision to include MicroStrategy in the Nasdaq-100 index. Brooks, Jane Dietze — who also serves on Galaxy Digital’s board — and Gregg Winiarski, chief legal officer at Fanatics Holdings, join the board, increasing its total membership to nine, according to a Dec. 20 filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Swan Bitcoin: Brooks’ Appointment a “BIG Deal” The three new board members will be eligible for equity awards, per the statement. Swan Bitcoin highlighted the significance of Brooks’ appointment in a Dec. 21 X post, calling it a “BIG deal.” “As Comptroller, Brooks oversaw the entire US banking system and is deeply connected,” the company said. Brooks, who stepped down as CEO of Binance.US in August 2021 after citing “differences over strategic direction,” also served as Acting Comptroller of the Currency for nine months in 2021. Crypto commentator MacroScope shared with their 77,200 X followers, “all three are good especially Brooks.” MicroStrategy Joins Nasdaq-100 This announcement coincides with MicroStrategy’s inclusion in the Nasdaq-100 Index, effective Dec. 23. On Dec. 13, Nasdaq confirmed that MicroStrategy (MSTR), Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR), and Axon Enterprise, Inc. (AXON) would be added to the index. Illumina, Inc.

Glassnode Co-Founders Warn Alts in Danger of Lagging Behind After Last Week’s Correction,"The creators of the crypto analytics firm Glassnode are warning that altcoins could lose all bullish momentum following last week’s market correction. Jan Happel and Yann Allemann, who go by the handle Negentropic on the social media platform X, tell their 63,400 followers that “altcoin season,” which they say began in late November, could come to an abrupt end after alts witnessed deep pullbacks over the last seven days. According to the Glassnode co-founders, traders and investors will likely have a risk-off approach on altcoins unless Bitcoin recovers a key psychological price point. “Is This the End of Altcoin Season? Bitcoin dominance is surging after dipping below $100,000, while altcoins are losing critical supports. Dominance has risen and resumed its upward trend, signaling a stronger BTC environment. If BTC stabilizes above $100,00, we might see a pump in altcoins now in accumulation zones. Until then, Bitcoin appears poised to lead, leaving altcoins lagging behind.” Source: Negentropic/X The Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) chart tracks how much of the total crypto market cap belongs to BTC. In the current state of the market, a surging BTC.D suggests that altcoins are losing value faster than Bitcoin. At time of writing, BTC.D is hovering at 59%. Looking at Bitcoin itself, the Glassnode executives say long-term Bitcoin holders are massively unloading their holdings as other investor cohorts pick up the slack. “The Board Keeps Shifting. As BTC continues flowing out of exchanges during this dip, long-term holders are exiting forcefully, while short-term holders step in without hesitation. Whales quietly accumulate, miners remain neutral, and selling pressure has merely reshuffled the board. New hands are absorbing the sales.” Source: Negentropic/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is worth $97,246.

Trump Fires Powell (TRUMPPOW), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPOW is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Fires Powell can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Fires Powell could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Fires Powell launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Fires Powell on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Fires Powell by entering its contract address – FWmVybuoRxJ79ZDHJ3Y8efeYsHsKL4qMNwJP8rCDsfmB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPOW. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trump-fires-powell-trumppow-solana-memecoin-will-surge-15000-before-exchange-listing-while-wif-shib-and-pepe-fall/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Dogecoin kicked things off, and Shiba Inu followed with its explosive rise, proving that meme coins can deliver jaw-dropping returns. Today, a new crop of meme coins is making waves. Among them, BTFD Coin is stealing the spotlight thanks to its innovative Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, generous staking rewards, and a referral program that’s making early investors smile. If you’re wondering about the best new meme coins to buy this month , we’ve got you covered with a deep dive into BTFD Coin, Neiro, and Notcoin. With the BIG50 bonus code, you can lock in the discounted Stage 7 price of $0.000064 and maximise your gains. It’s a deal that’s too good to pass up—especially when you see the explosive potential of BTFD Coin’s presale. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin That’s Raising the Bar Let’s cut to the chase— BTFD Coin isn’t your average meme token. It’s a bold, feature-packed project built for those who want more than laughs from their investments. If you’ve ever heard the saying “buy the dip,” that’s exactly what BTFD Coin encourages—seizing opportunity during market chaos. And let’s not forget, the coin’s presale is nothing short of legendary. The presale kicked off at just $0.000004 per coin and has now surged to $0.00013 in Stage 12—that’s an 837.5% ROI. Over $4.3M has been raised, with more than 57 billion coins sold to over 6,300 holders. The best part? Investors who use the BIG50 bonus code can still lock in the discounted Stage 7 price of $0.000064. This bonus alone is a game-changer, letting savvy buyers maximise their potential gains. Now, here’s where BTFD Coin really shines. Its beta P2E game went live in Stage 10 of the presale. While rewards aren’t available during the beta phase, players are raving about the experience. The full launch is expected to offer lucrative incentives, making it a win-win for gamers and investors alike. What about staking? BTFD offers a jaw-dropping 90% APY. Staking went live on December 2, allowing holders to earn passive income while holding their tokens. Add to that the Bulls Squad—an exclusive community of top investors—and the referral program that rewards users for bringing in new buyers, and you’ve got a coin that’s built for success. Imagine this: You invest $40,000 at the Stage 12 price of $0.00013 per coin. That nets you over 307 million tokens. When BTFD hits its post-presale listing price of $0.0006, your investment will skyrocket to $184,200. That’s the kind of return that turns heads and changes lives. BTFD’s success story is even more remarkable when you think about the global economy. Back in 1973, the world experienced a major financial crash, but those who bought the dips emerged victorious. BTFD Coin is a modern-day opportunity to capitalise on chaos. Head over to the BTFD presale page, connect your wallet, and don’t forget to enter the BIG50 code for a sweet discount. Neiro: The AI-Powered Meme Coin Next up, we’ve got Neiro, a meme coin with an AI twist. Unlike traditional meme tokens that rely solely on community hype, Neiro uses artificial intelligence to add real value. Its standout feature is an AI-powered trading bot that helps users optimize their investments. This isn’t just a gimmick; it’s a legitimate tool gaining popularity among both crypto enthusiasts and casual investors. Neiro’s presale performance has been strong, with significant funds raised so far. The coin is priced at $0.00009, and analysts predict it could reach $0.0005 after launch. While its return on investment potential might not be as dramatic as some other coins, Neiro’s steady growth and innovative features make it an attractive option for those looking for something different in the meme coin market. The community behind Neiro is another key strength. Its Telegram group is active, offering regular updates, AMA sessions, and giveaways. Neiro’s developers have also hinted at potential partnerships with major crypto platforms, which could further elevate its visibility and value. However, Neiro does come with some risks. The integration of AI adds complexity to the project. While it offers additional utility, it might not appeal to those who prefer a simpler, more straightforward investment. But for those open to exploring the intersection of AI and crypto, Neiro presents an intriguing option. Notcoin: The Meme Coin for Minimalists Finally, let’s talk about Notcoin. Its slogan, “It’s not a coin, it’s a movement,” perfectly captures its essence. Notcoin is a satirical take on meme coins, designed to highlight the absurdity of crypto while still offering real value. Its simple, stripped-down approach resonates with minimalists who appreciate its no-frills, no-nonsense vibe. What sets Notcoin apart is its anti-hype strategy. Unlike other coins that rely on flashy marketing and bold promises, Notcoin stays grounded. Its presale performance reflects a steady and modest start, appealing to those who see it as a long-term hold. A standout feature of Notcoin is its “Burn the Hype” initiative. With every transaction, a small percentage of tokens are burned, reducing supply and gradually increasing scarcity. This deflationary model has proven effective in enhancing token value over time. However, Notcoin’s minimalist and ironic approach might not be for everyone. Those seeking excitement, flashy features, or high-stakes drama may find it underwhelming. But for investors who value subtlety, irony, and a slow-and-steady strategy, Notcoin is a unique choice among the latest meme coins to consider this month. How to Buy BTFD Coin with the BIG50 Discount Buying BTFD Coin is simple, and using the BIG50 discount code makes it even better. Start by visiting the official BTFD presale page. Once there, click on “Connect Wallet” and choose your preferred wallet, such as MetaMask, Trust Wallet, or any other supported option. After connecting your wallet, look for the bonus code field and enter BIG50 to unlock the discounted Stage 7 price of $0.000064 per coin. Next, decide how many BTFD coins you want to buy, input the amount, and review the final price. When everything looks good, click “Buy Now” and confirm the transaction through your wallet. By using the BIG50 code, you’re not just saving money—you’re also taking advantage of a potentially lucrative opportunity . With the presale already raising over $4.3 million, now is the perfect time to make your move! Bottom Lines Whether you’re into the high-octane world of BTFD Coin, the AI-driven innovation of Neiro, or the minimalist charm of Notcoin, there’s no shortage of exciting opportunities in the meme coin space. Each of these projects brings something unique to the table, catering to different investor preferences. But let’s be real—BTFD Coin stands out as the clear frontrunner. Its P2E game, 90% APY staking rewards, and explosive presale performance make it a must-have for anyone looking to turn a profit in 2024. Don’t miss your chance to join the BTFD Coin presale now at a discounted price by using the BIG50 code. Make the most of this wealth-generation opportunity with BTFD Coin presale. Connect your wallet, secure your tokens, and watch your investment grow. The clock’s ticking—don’t wait too long to dive in.
