42403014,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAde9eN,1560547819,Crypterium Introduces Global Crypto Payments Card,"Crypterium - a financial technology startup based in Estonia -- launched the Crypterium Card, the first crypto card available globally.  Prior to this launch, crypto cards, such as the Coinbase Card, were only accessible in specific countries or by region, according to the company. Coinbase recently announced it would roll out services to six additional European countries after being only available for users in the U.K.  Crypterium believes that crypto cards are the “easiest and fastest way for holders to access their digital currencies,” but were concerned availability was too limited or arbitrary to make it a legitimate option for crypto payments on the world stage.  “By 'global' we mean that no matter where people are based, they can order and receive it in only 3 business days,” said Matias Lapuschin, in an email to CoinDesk. This point is repeated on the company website, that “no matter where you are based,” a Crypterium Card can be shipped to your door.  The company has already tested the payment services through 5,000 Estonian clients who preordered, to confirm it works as a payment option.  Card developers also tested the product while travelling to cryptocurrency conferences across the world, using the prepaid plastic to purchase goods and services in bitcoin, ether, and litecoin across the Americas, Asia and Europe, thus confirming the advertised claim of global application, Siranush Sharoyan, company representative, told CoinDesk in an interview.  Interest in the card is admittedly concentrated in regions where banking services are less developed, such as in South America and Southeast Asia, according to Sharoyan. Though she also said there are a number of requests coming from the U.S.  The card is linked to the Crypterium App, which has over 500,000 users in the U.S. and U.K. Those that are interested will need to provide proof of identity -- passport, national ID or driver’s license -- and proof of residence in the form of utility bill, bank or credit card statement.  The card does not charge transaction fees, though there is a 1.5% fee when adding prepaid funds. There are also daily and monthly limits, which top off at $10,000 per day, and $60,000 per month -- “which should be enough for anybody,” said Sharoyan.  Crypterium alleges it is fully compliant with U.K. and Estonian laws, and that it issues the cards using their bank partner’s license, according to Sharoyan. Though, when asked which bank the company partners with, Sharoyan did not immediately recall the name, and said she needed to “look at the [bank’s business] card,” which was not immediately handy.  Later, when CoinDesk asked for confirmation, a company spokesperson said, ""Our legal department says that we aren’t allow to disclose the partnership for reasons concerning competition among card players. We are, however, able to confirm that it is a top financial institution in the Philippines, fully compliant with local laws, as well as UK and EU regulations.""  However, the crypto card’s website states, “The Crypterium Card is a UnionPay prepaid debit card.” The card can be used wherever UnionPay is accepted. “Nowadays, there are nearly 23 million merchants connected to the UnionPay network in over 175 countries.”  ""Unlike other players in the market, we opted for UnionPay as a card processor because it’s the only one that enables global coverage. Visa and MasterCard work in regions: UK, Central Europe, US, etc.,"" said Matias Lapuschin, representative for Crypterium. ""For UnionPay, it’s either China or non-China. That gives us flexibility to serve all countries left behind by the rest of the cards in the market.""  The company established more than 300 partnerships with e-commerce retail services after building the first mobile payment service based on QR scanning in Eastern Europe.  It raised $1 million in a Series A funding, $7 million in a Series B financing in 2015, and $51 million during its 2017 ICO. It is backed by KPMG and H2 Ventures. Former general manager of Visa Europe, Steven Parker, serves as CEO. The company aims to make ""cryptocurrencies as liquid as cash,"" through its two main projects.  Crypertium saw that the regions where people actually treated crypto as a currency were also undeveloped in terms of services. ""The main players in the [crypto card] market are focusing on developed countries, like the UK, US or EEA. That’s leaving behind plenty of holders from countries like Venezuela, Brazil, India, South Korea, etc. The Crypterium Card was designed to promote inclusivity in crypto-based financial services,"" said Lapuschin.  In time, Crypterium will expand the coins it offers for the card, but will be selective about the currencies it selects. Sharoyan said the company is primarily looking at “major cryptocurrencies,” as well as companies “that are prepared to help us promote the product” through co-marketing or partnering to create solutions for their communities.

Founders Sergey Nazarov and Steve Ellis created SmartContract.com and Chainlink in order to create proper middleware between traditional data sources and blockchain-based systems. They are working with money movers SWIFT as well as database company Oracle.  “We realized that a reliable oracle mechanism is a gating issue for the creation of most of the use cases that people are expecting from our space, and set out to solve this limitation of blockchain infrastructure with security, reliability, and easy consumption of the inputs/outputs needed by smart contracts to reach this new level of usefulness,” said Nazarov, adding:  “In this case we are working with Google as someone who we’ve successfully made an on-chain data provider that can now securely interact with smart contracts that want to consume their high-quality data and/or various off-chain services. We’re trying to create the next generation of smart contracts that are able to go beyond tokenization, and will find their usefulness based on interactions with market events (DeFi), IoT events (Decentralized Insurance) and various other use cases.”  It’s important to note that this is one of the few blockchain products that Google has singled out in this way making the announcement a feather in Chainlink’s proverbial cap.  “At a high level, Ethereum Dapps (i.e. smart contract applications) request data from Chainlink, which in turn retrieves data from a web service built with Google App Engine and BigQuery,” wrote Allen Day, a Developer Advocate with Google. “One or more Chainlink nodes are listening for these calls, and upon observing, one executes the requested job. External adapters are service-oriented modules that extend the capability of the Chainlink node to authenticated APIs, payment gateways, and external blockchains. In this case, the Chainlink node interacts with a purpose-built App Engine web service.”  All of this means, quite simply, that Google’s products can now interact with decentralized applications in the same way, say, a client app can interact with a standard database server. Chainlink acts as the data middleman.  “Allowing smart contracts to interact with a data source of Google BigQuery’s quality, enables various new and exciting capabilities for Ethereum contracts in general e.g. more private ethereum transactions via submarine sends, as well as various exciting use cases/Dapps like prediction markets that will base their outcomes on BigQuery’s data,” said Nazarov. “We’ve really enjoyed working with the folks at Google on this initial implementation, and we’re looking forward to working with them in many more ways to come.”  Chainlink’s associated token, LINK, shot up on the news, hitting an all-time high of $1.95 before dropping to about $1.72 today.

42382128,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qfAL,1560538846,"Facebook's GlobalCoin May Be A 'Historic Initiative,' Say RBC Analysts","Facebook’s “crypto opportunity” comes with high expectations.  “We believe this may prove to be one of the most important initiatives in the history of the company to unlock new engagement and revenue streams,” RBC Capital Markets’ Mark Mahaney and Zachary Schwartzman said in a note on Thursday.  The two experts expect the currency to be used for payments, commerce, applications and gaming -- across Facebook's ecosystem that includes image-based social media platform Instagram and encrypted messaging service WhatsApp.  Mahaney and Schwartzman also repeated previously reported expectations that Facebook will release their currency’s white paper on June 18, following in Satoshi’s footsteps to explain the fundamental protocols that will underpin Libra, the internal codename for the project.  RBC said it plans to offer an analysis of the paper when it’s released, “to help investors analyze the underlying cryptoeconomics of the token.”  The currency is rumored to be a stablecoin backed by a number of global fiat currencies.  It has been in development for more than six months -- though the company indicated it has contemplated enveloping cryptocurrency into the social network as far back as the end of 2017 -- and has 100 staff working on its development. This includes two former compliance managers that migrated from Coinbase in May.  Facebook allegedly will offer employees the option to take their salary in the new currency. It has not been confirmed if the $514 billion company will offer incentive packages in GlobalCoin.  ""More people will turn to bitcoin for one simple reason—bitcoin is scarce, while Facebook’s cryptocurrency is not. People will migrate over time to the most honest ledger for storing their hard-earned wealth—and that’s not fiat currencies or derivatives thereof, including Facebook’s cryptocurrency,"" wrote Caitlin Long of the Wyoming Blockchain Task Force.  Now everyone is as excited about the product. Crypto-notable Charlie Shrem said:    I'm just gonna say it.      I think the ""FacebookCoin"" is an attempt by big tech, banks and credit card companies to lure people away from Bitcoin into ""better, easier, crypto"", which is nothing more than a fiat coin being masqueraded as crypto.    Millions will be fooled.    A lobbyist from Standard Chartered will join the Facebook crypto-unit staff in September, possibly to assist with political and regulatory scrutiny in the EU. Facebook emissaries have reportedly been having lunch with the Governor of the Bank of England to see how the project may progress in the country amid Brexit.  Visa, Mastercard, PayPal and Uber are all backing GlobalCoin to the tune of $10 million dollars. This is in addition to the $1 billion in VC funding Nathanial Popper of the New York Times has reported that Facebook is seeking, either as an investment or for collateral.  For as much as Facebook has raised, the company has also acquired smart contracts producer, Chainspace, to assist development.  RBC has an outperform rating on Facebook with a price target of $250 a share. Facebook’s stock is up more than 35% this year as of Thursday’s close of $177.47 a share.

42382142,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qfLf,1560535509,Concerns Over Facebook Data Use Derailed at Least 3 Crypto Partnerships,"Facebook’s GlobalCoin project, also known as Project Libra, may face significant hurdles as the social media giant works toward a prospective launch.  Despite reports that Facebook is gearing up to reveal its new cryptocurrency as early as next week, a source with knowledge of Facebook’s operations said the project’s software has a long way to go until it can be used. Sources attribute the delay to blockchain industry incumbents being reluctant to work on a project that doesn't appear to have the hallmarks of a true cryptocurrency.  One source estimated that early 2020 would be a more realistic timeframe for testing, so any imminent announcements would merely be forward-looking plans.  Based on conversations with seven knowledgeable sources, CoinDesk confirmed Facebook’s plan is to connect users’ financial information to their personal Facebook profiles. Such data would likley be under Facebook’s control, hosted in company databases. There are even talks about integrating with external payment processors like Mastercard, which the Wall Street Journal reported has signed on to help finance the GlobalCoin project. In a call with CoinDesk, Facebook declined to comment.  Sources compared GlobalCoin to Alipay, which allows digital payments across social platforms yet is also associated with Chinese government surveillance, and cited political lobbying as a cornerstone of Facebook’s broader effort.  This has created a rift between various partners from the blockchain industry, which were reluctant to work on a project that offered users little control over their digital identities. Sources say Facebook entered fruitless talks with startups Tendermint and Stellar, then even expressed an interest in acquiring MobileCoin, the startup advised by Signal creator Moxie Marlinspike.  The above-mentioned teams declined to comment. In their absence, Facebook acquired the blockchain startup Chainspace, with a keen eye on its proprietary consensus algorithm.  Blockchain consultant Maya Zehavi told CoinDesk she is concerned the GlobalCoin consortium with Visa, Mastercard, PayPal and Facebook could create a system with limited accountability yet ample power to exclude individual users from commerce. Plus, there’s reportedly a $10 million minimum charge for prospective GlobalCoin node operators.  “They are creating an anti-competitive moat,” Zehavi said, adding:  “It creates a silo of data rails without any guarantees about data sharing among the different participants, and the computation being done to access the services. Meaning some computation being done could kick you out of Uber, Facebook and Shopify, if you become a risk-management issue.”  Strategic goals  Given this conflict between the cypherpunk ethos and Facebook’s public plans, the social media giant is allegedly using aggressive recruiting.  Facebook allegedly hired a team with several dozen cryptocurrency experts with annual compensation packages worth several million dollars each, one source said. It should be noted, however, this may be seen as a competitive rate for rare skill sets in Silicon Valley.  Meanwhile, Facebook is aggressively pursuing partnerships with global brands such as Uber, that may someday accept GlobalCoin. Since the majority of Facebook’s 2.38 billion monthly active users live outside the United States, such partnerships would be crucial for branding this cryptocurrency as a global asset rather than an American fintech initiative.  One consultant said that Facebook’s Instagram and WhatsApp acquisitions have put the company in a very different position than it was a decade ago. Plus, the public views bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as more secure and private than traditional payment options, another source said explaining why Facebook may be marketing this revamp as a blockchain project.  Facebook declined to comment on how user data would be used or shared. It also declined to comment on how GlobalCoin accounts would be custodied.  “You’re creating a buffer zone of incumbents that can afford to participate,” Zehavi said of Facebook’s strategy. “Instead of creating a version of Stripe with data verification with privacy for developers to offer new applications and services.”  Facebook image via Shutterstock",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/06/14/concerns-over-facebook-data-use-derailed-at-least-3-crypto-partnerships,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c082cd3619a7ef32e2bc8b1b04296c4a56084785-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42382139,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qfKP,1560529823,Iceland's Currency Will Be First in Europe to Be Traded as E-Money,"The Financial Supervisory Authority of Iceland (FME) has approved Reykjavik-based Monerium as its first electronic money institution.  The designation, announced Friday, means that Monerium has regulatory approval to provide fiat payment services on a blockchain and use it throughout the European Economic Area. Electronic money is a well-established regulatory framework in Europe that's been in use for years, Sveinn Valfells, CEO and co-founder of Monerium, explained to CoinDesk in a phone call.  It's the first time, however, electronic money has been approved for use over a blockchain.  Monerium sees the fact that it's working under an established framework as a competitive advantage, Valfells said, adding:  ""For practical purposes, fiat will be the currency most people and institutions will want to use in the near- and medium-term. And if you are touching fiat in any way, you just have to comply with the relevant regulations.""  Monerium cofounder Jon H. Egilsson will discuss the news at a digital currency conference in Stockholm on Saturday. Egilsson was formerly chairman of the Supervisory Board of the Icelandic Central Bank.  Electronic money is fiat held and transferred digitally. The ConsenSys-backed Monerium will initially operate using the ethereum blockchain – though it is prepared to operate across public and private distributed ledgers, allowing expenditures and transfers to be made without an intermediary.  In a copy of his prepared remarks shared with CoinDesk in advance, Egilsson wrote:  ""Monerium e-money encompasses the benefits of programmable money on blockchain, in addition to being the closest form of central bank money there is – based on a proven EU regulatory framework.""  The legal concept of an electronic money institution (EMI) dates back to the financial crisis, established in a 2009 act by the European Union. The rule is primarily used now for prepaid debit cards, Valfells explained.  Valfells argues that many companies making similar products, such as fiat-backed stablecoins, designed technology first and looked for regulators to approve it. Monerium instead decided to base its technology on an existing set of rules. Valfells said:  ""We believe law is also protocol.""  How it works  Banks make money by turning deposits from customers into loans to borrowers. EMIs are more conservative with deposits.  From Egilsson's remarks:  ""Unlike bank deposits, an electronic institution (EMI) must safeguard clients funds separately from any other financial activities, such as lending. Instead, customer funds are invested in a segregated portfolio of high-quality liquid instruments along with regulatory minimum reserves. The structure is similar to a high-grade money market fund.""  The idea is that the EMI-model provides consumers with more protection. Fiat put into an EMI must always be redeemable without conditions.  By putting e-money on the blockchain, it also enables cross-border payments without a financial intermediary. The company plans to start with Icelandic krona (ISK). Once live, Monerium's version of ISK will be usable throughout the EU and should shortly be usable in many other parts of the world with similar regulatory regimes. More currencies will follow.  As a regulated form of payment, it follows the typical know-your-customer, anti-money-laundering procedures familiar throughout the developed world.  The world of fiat-backed global currencies is getting somewhat crowded. The CENTRE Consortium created by Circle and Coinbase is designed to allow member institutions to issue their own fiat-backed stablecoins. Earlier this week, the initiative opened itself to new members. Facebook's ""GlobalCoin"" is also reported to be backed by a basket of fiat currencies.  Monerium is still in closed beta. For its earliest partners, an e-money ISK will be available in a matter of days, Valfells said. Valfells estimated that as early as Q4 2019, the e-money ISK should become available to a wider audience.

42382135,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qfGd,1560528045,US State of Nevada Passes Flurry of Blockchain Bills,"Nevada passed regulatory sandbox legislation aimed at continuing blockchain investment and entrepreneurism in the state. Governor Steve Sisolak signed the “blockchain bills” on June 7 and 13.  These are parcel to a number of bills passed in the state that support the continued growth of financial technology and blockchain. In February of this year Nevada legislators introduced a suite of bills designed to promote blockchain adoption.  SB161 – Creates a regulatory sandbox for emerging technologies companies through a program in the Department of Business and Industry.  SB162 – Creates a definition for “public blockchain” within Nevada Revised Statutes and requires government agencies to accept electronically certified documents, including those on a blockchain.  SB163 – Authorizes businesses to store and maintain corporate records on a blockchain.  SB164 – Defines virtual currencies as intangible personal property and therefore exempts them from personal property taxation.  The state’s attitudes to the emerging technology were truly cut in 2017, after the successful passage of SB398 attracted significant blockchain investment to the state.  The most recent deregulatory legislation was lobbied for and supported by the Nevada Technology Association (NVTA), which worked with industry representatives to expand technology education, innovation, and investment to further diversify the state’s economy and promote high-quality jobs.  In 2018, the NVTA also supported the creation of the legislative Tech Caucus, a bi-partisan group of state senators and assembly members that support smart tech policy in Nevada.  Together the lobby and committee implemented the Wayfair decision for sales tax on online sales, which clarified that in using virtual currency a company does not have to follow the “marketplace facilitator” requirements.  Additionally, the NVTA led the efforts to oppose SB195, which would have enacted the Uniform Law for Virtual Currency and the supplemental act, which would require licensing from the Department of Business and Industry for businesses that “engaged in certain business activity involving virtual currency.”  “We’re thrilled to see that Nevada continues to take a thoughtful approach to technology,” said Jackie Morck, President of the Nevada Technology Association, in a statement. “By supporting light-touch legislation, our state is clearly committed to supporting innovation and investment. At the same time, the creation of the legislative Tech Caucus demonstrates that we’re serious about staying on the leading edge of emerging technologies.

42382140,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qfMv,1560522133,Jack Dorsey Hints at How Square Crypto May Support Bitcoin's Code,"After revealing that his payments firm Square is building a small team to help with bitcoin and cryptocurrency development back in March, CEO Jack Dorsey has revealed more details about the project – even though it's still early days.  In an interview with The Next Web, Dorsey, who is also CEO of Twitter, confirmed that he'd recently hired former Google director Steve Lee to lead the team. Dorsey said that he'd interviewed ""tens of candidates"" for the post before arriving at Lee as his choice.  The new hire will take responsibility for building the remainder of the team, as well as defining its future path, he said. Square is currently eyeing a maximum of five engineers and one designer, who will likely work on a single project rather than many.  That's because Dorsey aims to ""make some step changes to various aspects of the ecosystem, versus an iteration,” he said.  While one would expect devs, the choice of a designer comes as something of a surprise in such a early stage project. Dorsey put this down to the need for the need to make cryptocurrencies more accessible, as well as providing education on the technology.  Joking that the team doesn't want any ""jerks,"" Dorsey also said that it's important any candidates must have good technical abilities.  “We want to see significant open-source contributions to various projects. Bitcoin Core is a great example of that, but there’s others, too,"" he said.  As for its particular role in the crypto ecosystem, he explained that Square Crypto might conduct “grungy, but meaningful” code reviews in order to speed up development. While there are plenty of devs helping out on cryptocurrency projects, few are working on checking the correctness of the code, Dorsey said – changing that could give a ""huge boost"" to the space.  Outside that, there's need for work to improve efficiency and security. ""There’s still a number of big flaws within the Bitcoin community right now,"" Dorsey told TNW.  The CEO also indicated that he wants to keep the role of Square in the mechanics of the team to a minimum, ruling out cheap stock options in favor of optional bitcoin salaries in order to build a desire to better ""serve the community.""  The work carried out by the team should also be open to the public. While it's not set in stone yet, Dorsey suggested Square Crypto could operate like a traditional open-source project.  Aside from the more general development work of the crypto team, Square is eyeing bitcoin technology in its products too. Back in February, Dorsey announced during an interview with podcaster Stephan Livera that there are plans to integrate the lightning network – a still early-stage bitcoin payments tech – with Square’s Cash app.  Jack Dorsey image via CoinDesk archives",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/06/14/jack-dorsey-hints-at-how-square-crypto-may-support-bitcoins-code,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/df0685eca5f3ec830279f10bdefcfb7a63a1bc92-960x640.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42382141,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qfOB,1560517257,A Protocol for Issuing Tokens Launches on Bitcoin’s Lightning Network,"Many bitcoiners thought it would be a cold day in hell when BHB Network co-founder Giacomo Zucco admitted that all tokens aren’t inherently scams.  But, as it turns out, all he needed were the right partners. What started as a client’s request for a more secure alternative to ethereum’s ERC-20 tokens will soon emerge as the first unique protocol for issuing tokens via bitcoin’s lightning network.  A better token-minting protocol, Zucco said, could be a game changer for entrepreneurs.  “If ethereum is going to die eventually, then we have very high hopes that this will be sustainable long term,” the notorious ethereum critic told CoinDesk.  This open-source token project, called Spectrum, includes contributions from investors at Fulgur Ventures and Poseidon Group, startups such as Bitrefill and Chainside, as well as support from crypto exchange giant Bitfinex. The goal is to change the perception that bitcoin is too slow moving for experimentation.  Indeed, Bitfinex CTO Paolo Ardoino said in a press release that he hopes to issue a Spectrum-compatible version of the tether stablecoin by the end of the year.  “Bitfinex will continue supporting Lightning projects and features in our platforms,” Ardoino added.  Spectrum, which uses the RGB colored coin standards anchored to bitcoin, allows people to issue tokens several layers above bitcoin’s base layer. This would complement, rather than compete with, sidechain tools like Blockstream’s Liquid, as well as efforts to enable cross-currency swaps with the lighting network.  The fundamental difference here is that ethereum-based tokens bake complex logic, such as automated token distribution related to external factors, straight into the assets themselves via chunks of code called smart contracts.  Gregory Rocco, a staffer at ethereum venture studio ConsenSys, told CoinDesk that colored coins never really took off because, compared to ethereum’s built-in support for complex functions, the former required external coordination for the tokens to “represent something” beyond simple units.  On the other hand, a Spectrum-compatible RGB token will be more like an international socket converter connecting the token to the bitcoin blockchain via the lightning network, and also externally to software that automates functions similar to smart contracts. There’s still some abstraction, but some bitcoin advocates feel the security trade-offs are worth it.  “If you want to do something with tokens, we think Layer 3 is the right place to put it,” Zucco said of his Spectrum solution. “With lightning now you can be competitive, fast, creative, reckless.”  Federico Tenga, co-founder of the startup Chainside, told CoinDesk some of his consulting clients have already asked for bitcoin wallets that support such units for use cases such as equity tokenization.  “Theoretically you could do anything you could do on ethereum,” Tenga said. “Some people may use RGB on Liquid, ideally, if the standard is adopted, it would be useful across different protocols, maybe even centralized databases. Even for atomic swaps, things like that.”  Playing catch-up  By expanding on the earlier work done by Blockstream developer Alekos Filini, Spectrum contributors are looking to provide a do-it-yourself bitcoin toolkit to enable the network effects that propelled ethereum’s popularity.  After all, the reason DIY ERC-20 tokens became so popular is that all ethereum-based platforms and wallets were compatible with them. That made it easy for startups and hobby projects to distribute them with some level of liquidity. Along those lines, Spectrum will provide the first bitcoin-centric standard for tokens that can utilize the lightning network for near-instant transactions.  Bitfinex will be the first to promote this protocol, via its new tether variant.  Bitrefill CCO John Carvalho said he believes the subsequent snowball effect could turn the bitcoin ecosystem into a “playground where people are going to start doing things like they are trying to do on ethereum.”  Since Bitrefill recently closed a $2 million seed round, Carvalho said his startup’s goal for 2019 is “to collaborate with more bitcoin businesses to grow the [lightning] network,” including the exploration of token use cases. To that end, Bitrefill is also hiring.  On the other hand, Robert Paone, head of growth at the token exchange platform AirSwap, told CoinDesk it would take considerable work for a lightning-compatible token to compete with ERC-20 tokens. Scalar Capital cofounder Linda Xie agreed with Paone, saying Tenga’s wallet alone would hardly give the protocol an edge compared to all the exchanges and wallets that already support ethereum-based tokens.  “The infrastructure around lightning is still not robust enough,” Paone said via email. “Lightning Network is still a bit complex and difficult to interact with, at least in comparison to the ease of using an ERC-20 with MetaMask, MyEtherWallet, etc.”  Paone added:  “Lightning is a long way off from being competitive against ERC-20.”  Perhaps the weather in hell is merely lukewarm with a crisp breeze at this point. Despite a lingering distaste for token sales, BHB Network’s Zucco conceded that, as long as clients continue to seek help with token issuance, Spectrum could provide a useful conduit.  “If we assume hyperbitcoinization, we assume many people will have a bitcoin wallet,” Zucco said, referring to the idea that bitcoin will become a dominant global currency. “You can leverage Spectrum because it is part of the logic stack you are already using.”  Lightning image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | SPONSORED,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/06/14/a-protocol-for-issuing-tokens-launches-on-bitcoins-lightning-network,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f88402ce2e2fabf3d28a879c54d0121c0bb63723-2560x1805.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42382151,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qfWz,1560513620,Bitfinex Is Starting to Buy Back and 'Burn' Its LEO Exchange Token,"Cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex has announced a transparency initiative that will see it put on full view the buying back and ""burning"" of its LEO exchange token.  In an announcement Friday, the firm said as part of its token redemption process, the UNUS SED LEO Transparency Initiative will allow the public to see parent firm iFinex use its gross revenues to purchase circulating LEO tokens at market rates. These will then be destroyed, or burned, as the firm effectively pays back those who bought the exchange token in a $1 billion sale early last month.  Bitfinex appears to have launched the sale to cover an $850 million shortfall flagged by the New York attorney general in April. The AG's office said Bitfinex had kept the lost millions secret and covered it with a loan from sister firm Tether Ltd, issuer of the tether stablecoin.  The redemption mechanism went live at 10.00 UTC Friday. The firm said tokens will be burned ""every 3 hours until 100% of supply has been taken out of circulation.""  As the LEO buyback progresses, Bitfinex said it will provide the public with ""real-time insights into all collected platform fees, and subsequent LEO burns"" via a dedicated dashboard.  The firm further explained:  ""We have decided upon a continuous burning mechanism – verifiable and in real-time – to keep the process as fair as possible for our users. As our revenues flow in continuously, we felt that the fairest approach to token buybacks would be one built around continuous and constant redemptions. We are doing this to remove the possibility of uncertainty from LEO holders, subsequently allowing our community to track iFinex revenues, as well as LEO token burn quantities, in an open manner.""  The first phase of the burn mechanism only includes revenue from trading fees. However, the exchange said it plans in coming weeks to include ""all revenue streams.""  In response to the New York attorney general's claim the company had lost the $850 million, Bitfinex responded that the funds had in fact been locked up on a payments platform called Crypto Capital.  In today's announcement, the firm said any funds recovered from Crypto Capital would be used to buy and burn LEO tokens, as would an amount worth ""at least 80% of recovered net funds"" from its 2016 hack of cryptos worth $80 million at the time.

42393839,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpDYE3,1560510619,"Bull Trap? Bitcoin’s Price Rise to $8,300 Isn’t Backed by High Volumes","View  Bitcoin has rallied more than 9 percent in the last nine days, but on low volumes – a sign of low investor confidence. As a result, the gains could be short lived.  The bearish volume divergence indicates BTC could dive out of a ""rising wedge"" bearish reversal pattern seen on the 4-hour chart.  A wedge breakdown, if confirmed, could see a return to $8,000 or lower.  If trading volumes pick up in the next 24 hours, prices may rise above $8,500 over the weekend, validating a bearish channel breakout witnessed earlier this week.  A clear divergence between prices and trading volumes on the charts suggests bitcoin’s (BTC) recent $800 rally could be short-lived.  Prices are currently up more than 9 percent from recent lows near $7,500 on June 6. Notably, BTC revived the short-term bullish outlook with a move above $8,100 on Wednesday. The follow-through has been positive, as well.  Yes, as trading volumes haven't picked along with the price rise, the breakout lacks substance.  For instance, bitcoin’s 24-hour trading volume across all cryptocurrency exchanges currently stands at $19 billion – down 42 percent from the high of $33 billion seen on May 16, according to CoinMarketCap.  More importantly, daily trading volume has averaged roughly $18 billion throughout the recent recovery from $7,500 to $8,300, which is significantly lower than the sell volume of $24 billion and $29 billion seen on May 30 and June 4.  While the wider market is reported to be rife with inflated volumes, the numbers from major exchanges included in the calculation of Bitwise’s ""real"" bitcoin trading volume also show the recent price rise is not backed by big volumes.  The top cryptocurrency by market capitalization is currently trading at $8,270 on Bitstamp, having hit a high of $8,335 in the U.S. trading hours yesterday.  Daily chart (CoinMarketCap)  Bitcoin’s daily trading volume consistently printed above its 50-day moving average throughout the price rise from $4,000 to $9,000.  However, volume has been sitting below the 50-day average since June 6, putting a question mark on the sustainability of the rally from $7,500 to $8,300.  Daily chart (major exchanges)  As can be seen above left, bitcoin trading volumes on Bitstamp have tapered off significantly over the last 10 days, with volume bars consistently printing lower highs.  Volumes continue to remain low despite the bearish channel breakout witnessed earlier this week – a sign of low investor confidence in the price rise. Further, volume numbers on Coinbase and Bitfinex (above right) paint a similar picture.  That bearish divergence of trading volumes indicates the cryptocurrency may dive out of the rising wedge pattern (above left), confirming an end of the bounce from lows near $7,500.  A wedge breakdown, if confirmed, could yield a sell-off to $8,000. Acceptance below that psychological support would expose recent lows near $7,500.  If trading volumes improve in the next 24 hours, bitcoin will likely rise well above $8,500, validating Wednesday’s falling channel breakout.
