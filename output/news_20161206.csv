42427194,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK0Glh,1481064441,"ECB, Bank of Japan Launch Joint Distributed Ledger Research Effort","The European Central Bank is weighing the use of distributed ledger tech in partnership with Japan’s central bank, one of its senior officials said today.  Speaking today at the Handelsblatt Annual Conference Banken-Technologie in Frankfut, ECB executive board member Yves Mersch offered new details on its work in the area.  Mersch said that the the two institutions plan to explore the tech over the next months, with an eye to publish the results of its research sometime next year. The ECB has also formed an internal task force focused on distributed ledgers, building on past research efforts.  He told attendees:  “Together with the Bank of Japan, we agreed to launch a joint research project which studies the possible use of [distributed ledger technology] for market infrastructure. The project is expected to release its main findings next year. This work can help define how new technologies can change the global financial ecosystem of today and ensure that central banks are adequately prepared.”  However, Mersch remarked that the tech “is not ready for mass adoption”, adding that at present that the ECB’s technical and security requirements would prohibit integration today. Further, any system that might be developed either solely by the ECB or in partnership with other central banks would be subject to intense scrutiny prior to launch, Mersch said.  “It cannot be stressed enough that any technology-based market infrastructure service needs to be mature enough to meet high requirements in terms of safety and efficiency,” he noted.  The statements perhaps represent the ECB’s most forceful on the subject to date. A number of central banks worldwide, most notably the Bank of England, have invested time and resources in investigating the potential to replace some of its infrastructure with the tech, or utilize it to issue central bank-tied digital currencies.  According to Mersch, the ECB wants to be a stakeholder in that global effort.  “We are on a journey which could radically alter the financial ecosystem as we know it. The ECB is committed to be part of this journey,” he concluded.

42427198,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK0Gxh,1481060305,Hackers Steal Over $300k From One of Blockchain's Biggest VCs,"A notable blockchain industry investor was hacked today, the latest target in a string of apparent social engineering attacks that have taken aim at cryptocurrency users.  The hackers claim to have stolen and liquidated 110,000 REP (upwards of $300,000) in the digital currency Augur plus an additional unknown sum of ether, the cryptocurrency on the ethereum blockchain, owned by Bo Shen, founder of VC firm Fenbushi Capital.  Speaking via Shen's Twitter account, the hacker credited his sale with dropping the dollar value of Augur's digital asset Reputation (REP) from 0.0035 BTC (then roughly $2.60) to 0.0026 BTC ($1.96), a decline that began early this morning. At press time, the price of REP has since recovered to just under 0.0040 BTC, according to data from Poloniex.  Statements from the hacker suggest that there is currently a team of hackers (or at least a ""few"") now targeting a full list of Augur investors as part of a string of attacks that have taken place in recent weeks.  When asked why the group was perpetrating the attacks, the hacker responded:  ""For money obviously.""  The hacker validated rumors circulating online that indicated big sell orders placed in ether and Augur were the result of his group.  Shen confirmed the hack to CoinDesk, though he did not disclose the total lost in the attack. In response to rumors more than $1m in ether was stolen, he responded the total amount was ""less than that"" but offered no further details.  Bribery and retribution  However, the hacker sought to stress that, in his view, that attacks (at least in the case of Augur) were preventable.  According to the hacker, the group had previously been in touch with Augur's open-source development team. A prediction market project announced in 2014, the REP tokens Augur issued during its crowdsale have been traded publicly since October.  Augur core developer Joey Krug acknowledged that he has been in contact with the group before and said the hackers had asked for a $60k ransom that was not paid. Krug further noted that, as the tokens function as digital bearer assets, there is not much the technical community around the project ""can do"" about the threat posed to users.  ""We've been sending emails out with instructions. If you don't sell REP on an exchange, and store in cold storage, it's fine. But if you store on an exchange, they can engineer your phone number, change your password and use that to login,"" Krug said.  As such, the attacks highlight the security challenges investors and blockchain businesses continue to face when storing and safeguarding various cryptocurrencies.  For example, Augur indicated the attacker was able to glean information (including email addresses) from its public Slack chat group.  String of attacks  Notably, Krug suggested that he believes the hacker is the same individual that is responsible for attacks on users of the digital currency exchange Kraken.  He referred users who are concerned about the attacks to a blog post issued by the exchange in which it detailed the extent of what it believes to be a pervasive issue.  ""In the past month, there’ve been at least 10 cases of people publicly involved in the cryptocurrency scene being victimized by mobile phone hijacking. The consequences have been expensive, embarrassing, enduring, and, in at least one case, life-threatening,"" the exchange wrote.  The post advises users against popular communication methods such as phone calls and text messages, and advocates that users provide services like Google Voice with fake information that is more difficult for hackers to surface.  All in all, the post suggests investors follow a complex series of 40 steps to protect their assets from the attacks. Krug, however, suggested that, for now, investors should be more wary about two-factor authentication when using cryptocurrency.

42427186,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK0GZh,1481050328,Russia's Controversial Bitcoin Bill Could See Further Delays,"Russia’s finance ministry is reportedly delaying the introduction of a bill regulating cryptocurrencies until sometime next year.  According to Russian media source Lenta, Deputy Finance Minister Alexei Moiseev said that the measure could be introduced as early as next fall, though he appears to have indicated that the bill could see further delays. The comments were said to have been made during an interview at an event in London.  ""Not until the autumn of next year,"" Moiseev was quoted as saying, according to a translation.  Russia’s efforts to develop – let alone pass – legislation related to the technology has come in fits and bursts since 2015, with movement earlier this year stymied amidst disagreement between government officials on the final scope. The measure, as it currently stands, would focus on the creation and proliferation of so-called ""money surrogates"", a classification that would cover bitcoin and other digital currencies.  At the same time, the Russian central bank, in tandem with domestic financial institutions, have pursued research into potential blockchain applications. Financial firms have investigated the tech for possible use on their own as well.  For its part, the government has also experimented with the tech. In October, Russia’s Federal Antimonopoly Service said it was working in partnership with Sberbank on a document storage project.

42427192,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK0Gjh,1481044876,Austria's Erste Bank Awards Ethereum Projects in Startup Contest,"Austrian bank Erste Bank sponsored a blockchain startup contest, awarding the teams behind two ethereum-focused projects.

42427199,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK0Gzh,1481036410,Donald Trump's Transition is a Trial Run for Smart Contracts,"When Republican President-elect Donald Trump is sworn in as the 45th President of the United States next January, a new era of widespread deregulation is expected to commence.  Bolstered by the support of a Republican-led Congress, Trump has sworn to erase consumer and investor protections that he argues kill jobs in nearly every large regulated industry, from healthcare to energy production to finance — all of which have been targeted for disruption by blockchain innovators.  The problem is, at this early stage of blockchain's development, the only large-scale implementation of a certain kind of self-executing code believed to hold the biggest potential ended in a total failure.  Earlier this year, countless investors watched helplessly in the hours following the hack of The DAO, a distributed autonomous organization that raised millions of dollars using a framework of by-laws and workflow captured with self-executing code called smart contracts. The DAO had no boss and no oversight.  The promise of blockchain leading up to the The DAO's collapse was that these and other back-office operations could be coded using ethereum's distributed ledger, letting investors and counterparties work together without middlemen.  As it turned out though, oversight was needed after all. Functions in the code were exploited to drain The DAO of millions of dollars it had raised, and the only way to stop the loss was for the group behind ethereum to coordinate a massive effort to reset the system.  The very the cryptographic protections that made the code so secure prevented it from being changed.  ""Code is law"" was the mantra uttered by some of the most extreme advocates of the technology — before the ethereum 'hard-fork' rescued investors by undoing what the contract had been tricked into executing.  Now, in the lead up to the expected inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, huge swathes of the financial sector are experimenting with similar ways to automate a wide range of services using smart contracts and similar self-executing code.  But alongside the transition of power, the process of what it takes to write smart contracts is being reimagined to ensure the chaos surrounding The DAO doesn't ease its way into mainstream finance.  Evolving blockchains  There are already some novel takes on smart contracts being pursued by the likes of R3CEV and Digital Asset Holdings, which are largely aimed at streamlining inter-bank transactions and post-trade services.  As blockchain companies prepare for the large-scale deregulation across industries, the $7.6bn investor communications firm Broadridge (which spent $95m on blockchain-related assets) is hard at work building its own solution.  Last week, the head of Broadridge's blockchain team spoke with CoinDesk about how to make sure workflows enshrined in blockchain-based smart contracts can be modified after they initiate.  Broadridge global head of strategy and blockchain lead, Vijay Mayadas, told CoinDesk:  ""If you have a smart contract which is valid in a particular regulatory regime and it no longer becomes valid, then you have to create a new smart contract, like version two. It will work in a very similar way with some tweaks, relative to version one.""  For developers who have learned lessons from The DAO's collapse, the transition between these two versions need not be any more dangerous than the transition of the regulatory regimes themselves, according to smart contracts researcher and Cornell professor Emin Gün Sirer.  But for developers who haven’t fully learned the lessons of The DAO, Sirer gave a dire warning of what to expect.  ""Smart contracts without escape hatches are like programs without safety checks combined with contracts without arbitration clauses,"" he told CoinDesk. ""Your code will go wrong, your organization will run in ways you did not anticipate, your money will get lost, and you'll have absolutely no recourse.""  Trumpian business logic  Another way to think about these smart contracts is as the encoded business logic behind work flows.  Once these smart contracts are initiated, their business logic transacts the data and records the results on the immutable, shared blockchain just like any other transaction.  During a regulatory regime change, the composition of that logic needs to be altered to reflect the changing demands for what information needs to be captured and stored, and what information can drift off into the digital ether unrecorded.  But by the very nature of the blockchain, the existing records logged under the business logic of the earlier regime remain unchanged.  ""That data was generated in that environment and it's immutable,"" said Mayada. ""What will happen is there would be different business logic which would generate that data.""  So far, Donald Trump's position regarding blockchain development is unknown. But the business logic regulated smart contract developers will be expected to encode is more certain.  Initially, Trump's tough talk towards the banking industry leading up to his election, helped contribute to bankers largely backing the Democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, according to a Wall Street Journal report.  But since the election those same bankers have flocked to the President-elect.  Among Trumps deregulation plans he has promised to ""dismantle"" much of the Dodd-Frank Act that has cost the financial sector $36bn in compliance costs over six years.  Escape hatches  But undoing regulatory obligations in a smart contract world isn't as easy as deleting the old requirements and adding new ones.  Today, Broadridge has kept secret the details of its work to simplify investor communications, but Professor Sirer argues that key regulatory flexibility will be brought about by technology known as an ""escape hatch"".  If Broadridge or any other regulated institution were to initiate a smart contract prior to Trump’s inauguration, escape hatches encoded in the genesis block would help prevent the contract from running out of control, as happened with The DAO.  Sirer breaks down these coded escape hatches into two categories. The first is a centralized escape hatch, which he argues would deprive a distributed system of its value by placing its final control in the hands of a single person or entity.  But earlier this year, he published the specifications for a decentralized escape hatch (DEH) that could help regulated entities to stay compliant with ever-changing demands without compromising the ""desirable properties"" of a blockchain.  Sirer described such an implementation to CoinDesk:  ""You must expect your smart contract applications to be updated over time, especially in a system like this when things are known to change in the future. Once you understand this has to happen, building the required escape hatches is just the cost of doing business.""  Money to spend  Currently, Broadridge is only in the earliest days of its smart contract development.  Mayadas told CoinDesk his team of 30 is building largely on the ethereum blockchain, with other experiments using the Digital Asset Modelling Language (DAML) created by Digital Asset Holdings (in which his company is an investor), and the Hyperledger consortium, of which Broadridge is a member.  But with $2.9bn in revenue last year from its proxy services and 85% market share in the US, Broadridge could soon be using a blockchain to help global investors communicate in increasingly sophisticated ways.  It is exactly this potential that Sirer thinks is the reason the firm spent that $95m in the first place.  While Mayadas wouldn’t go into details about exactly how the investment is being used to build blockchain applications, the ability to remain nimble in the face of ever-changing demands while still leveraging the benefits of a shared, immutable ledger is central to the company's investment.  A recently published annual report described the assets acquired from shareholder communications platform Inveshare as giving Broadridge a ""dynamic architecture"" that will help it ""more rapidly develop a streamlined distributed ledger over the next several years.""  Established systems  Fortunately, much of the workflow that financial institutions like Broadridge conduct is already largely established, unlike the DAO.  These established workflows mean that, while Trump moves to appoint members of his cabinet and lay the framework for deregulation, including appointing a new chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, there's plenty work to be done.  According to Tabb Group’s head of FinTech research and the former chief operating officer at NYSE Technologies, Terry Roche, the ""tremendous amount of iterations"" the workflows have undergone make them ripe to be written as self-executing code.  The trick will be to ensure that the code that is written accurately reflects the workflow itself.  Roche told CoinDesk:  ""There will need to be significant rigor, next-generation toolsets that will need to be applied to smart contracts in this environment to understand what the impacts of those code bases will be and I think more importantly, to understand the trees of unintended consequences that could come out of the codebase.""  Smart(er) contracts  In the quest to build smart contracts with escape hatches and perhaps other means of avoiding The DAO's fate, while capitalizing on their promise, one thing is clear: while less regulation might mean less work for bankers and regulators, the process of changing won’t necessarily be any less time consuming to coders.  Mayadas tells CoinDesk his firm has a ""wait and see"" approach to seeing ""how the new administration deals with the current regulatory environment,"" but he gave no indication that the work being done by his team would stop or even slow down.  Sirer supports the idea that there's no reason to wait, so long as the developers are building escape hatches to avoid becoming cryptographically trapped in an old regulatory structure.  Sirer concluded:  ""The building must continue at its current pace for the simple reason that the regulators have a very soft touch at the moment and there’s no reason to anticipate regulators coming into the space with a heavy hand. I don’t see that happening at the moment and I don’t for the next four years.""

42427201,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK0H1h,1481025492,Why I'm Taking Bitcoin Profits Amid Potential Price Resistance,"Tuur Demeester is an independent investor, newsletter writer and editor in chief at Adamant Research. Launched in 2015, Adamant Research provides a monthly newsletter service.  In this opinion piece, Demeester discusses his latest bitcoin trades and why he's not conviced the price is poised to rally higher.  The bitcoin price has more than doubled since I first published the report ""How to Position for the Rally in Bitcoin"" little over a year ago.  It's been a great run, and I think there is a lot of potential left on the upside, but nothing goes up in a straight line and we are faced with a potential price resistance zone at $700-800.  Here's how I see it: in the chart above, the straight line is simply the $700– ¥4,000 price resistance (a potential price target for traders), and the slanted line is the resistance above a cup-and-handle continuation pattern that's been forming for the past two years.  Since the price went above $700, I've been selling some bitcoins, some more even today, to lock in profit and give myself some more ammo to buy back if prices drop. On the downside, I see support at the $600 and $450 levels.  That being said, the cup-and-handle pattern is a huge deal in my view, and if we break out of it, it could catapult the price well over the previous all-time high – perhaps to $1,600 in short order.  For your consideration, the chart below shows the bitcoin price in Chinese yuan. Because of the 10% devaluation versus the dollar, the price has already breached both the¥4,000 and ¥5,000 resistance, big question is now if it can break out of that completed cup and handle pattern:  I remember telling myself to be cautious with my optimism when bitcoin rallied to $30 in early 2013 – because that was the previous all-time high – only to see the price consequently rally up to $260 in a matter of weeks.  Since that time, however, bitcoin has matured from a tiny startup currency to the equivalent of a mid-cap S&P 400 stock, making explosive price moves a bit less likely, and currently we're also facing some scalability bottlenecks.  Bitcoin transaction fees have increased to at times over $0.15 per transaction, and it'll possibly take another six months to activate on-chain and second layer volume capacity, allowing for lower costs.  For the time being, exchanges and other startups are processing millions of off-chain bitcoin transactions per day at very low fees (the trade-off is that this is less secure), which I think shows that the ecosystem is very dynamic.  Nonetheless, the hurdles towards secure decentralized scalability are real in my view and so could depress investors' sentiment somewhat in the coming weeks and months.  In sum, even though I think we could see a pullback in the short to medium term, I'm optimistic on the prospects of bitcoin for 2017, and I'm still expecting the price to approach or exceed the 2014 all-time highs.
