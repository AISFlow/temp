42403696,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgXzb,1576616411,"Canaan’s Post-IPO Stock Plunge Reveals Sales Slump, Price War With Bitmain","Cryptocurrency mining computer-maker Canaan Inc. may have picked the worst time for its initial public stock offering, which valued the company at $1.3 billion.      The stock price has declined in all but four of the first 17 trading sessions since the Hangzhou-based company’s Nov. 21 sale of $90 million of U.S. shares. It's down 35 percent since the start of last week.       Canaan’s performance is being closely monitored in the cryptocurrency industry. It was the first big maker of data-mining computers to sell shares publicly and its valuation serves many investors as a sector bellwether. The shares have tumbled even as the price of bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, has been mostly stable over the past month, currently around $6,500.       Its stock price drop is taking place “as bitcoin miners face a challenging environment,” wrote research firm TradeBlock in a report last week. CoinDesk reached out to Canaan’s management but no response was received as of press time.       Industry executives say the big makers of bitcoin-mining computers, colloquially known as “rigs,” are in a sales slump. That’s a surprising development since many observers predicted a frenzy of upgrades ahead of bitcoin’s once-every-four-years mining-reward halving, expected in May. When that happens, the reward for successfully mining a new block of data will get cut in half. It’s widely expected that prior-generation mining rigs will become unprofitable for operators who don’t have access to unusually cheap electricity.       Bitmain, the dominant industry player, recently announced a series of sales incentives to move backlogged or stale inventory, including promising limited price guarantees to buyers willing to commit to bulk purchases and in some cases renting out second-tier mining rigs under profit-sharing agreements.     Hashing out information on their own    It doesn’t help that investors are flying blind: According to the data provider FactSet, the stock has attracted no analyst coverage from Wall Street brokerage firms, forcing traders to generate their own models of the company’s profitability based on publicly available crypto-industry metrics like hashrate – a gauge of the amount of computer-processing power working to confirm new data blocks on the bitcoin network.       Over the past week, the bitcoin network’s hashrate has averaged about 90 quintillion operations, or exahashes, per second. Just a couple months ago, it hit an all-time-high around 100 exahashes per second, after averaging about 40 exahashes per second at the start of the year.             Matt D’Souza, co-founder and CEO of Blockware Solutions, which brokers mining-rig purchases, says that the surge in bitcoin’s hashrate during the first eight months of the year was a sign that operators were upgrading to faster, more efficient machines – leading to an increase in the network’s collective computing power.       The upgrades continued for several months even after bitcoin’s price peaked around $13,000 in late June.       But now, D’Souza says, miners are becoming somewhat more reluctant to invest in new machines until they see signs that bitcoin prices might start rising. That’s evident from the recent stall-out in the hashrate’s growth.       “They need to be assured that they're in an environment for long-term profitability,” D’Souza said. “That's why some of these guys have stopped buying.”     Price cuts    Bitmain managed to build a dominant market share in the crypto industry, partly thanks to the runaway popularity of its S9 Antminers. But those are now at risk of becoming obsolete, and in recent months Bitmain has cut prices steeply on some of its top-selling models, D’Souza said.       Mike Maloney, chief financial officer at Coinmint LLC, a private cryptocurrency mining firm, says that the ultimate prize for these manufacturers is winning the loyalty of a growing cadre of large-scale miners who can shop for rigs in bulk and negotiate contracts for cheap electricity.       “This is a trend that we're going to be seeing in bitcoin mining,” Maloney said in a phone interview. “Bitmain is taking the lead.”      Canaan has scheduled the release of its next-generation rig, the AvalonMiner 11 series, for early next year. But that machine is expected to be less power-efficient than the Bitmain S17+ model, which is already out, said D’Souza.       According to Bitmain’s website, its top-priced S17+ model, which ships in seven days for $1,930, can produce 73 terahashes (trillion operations) per second, at a power efficiency of 40 joules per terahash.       Canaan’s top-priced model, according to its website, is the “February batch” of the AvalonMiner A1166-68T machine for $1,978, providing 68 terahashes per second at an efficiency of 47 joules per terahash. In this case, a higher efficiency rating is worse, because it indicates more power usage and thus a higher operating cost.       “They're in a tough position,” D’Souza said of Canaan. “They need cash and that's because they need to upgrade their hardware and stay competitive with Bitmain.”     The risks were disclosed    Canaan is led and controlled by its CEO and chairman, Nangeng Zhang, who was 36 at the time of the IPO, according to an offering prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Nicknamed ""Pumpkin,"" he received a master’s degree in software engineering from Beihang University in 2010, and from September 2010 through October 2013 he was pursuing a Ph.D. degree at the Chinese university.       As early as 2013, Zhang and his team were pioneers in the use of an advanced type of microchip known as application-specific integrated circuits, or ASICS, to mine for cryptocurrencies, according to the prospectus.       The offering was structured so that Zhang would own 15 percent of the total shares outstanding but retains about 73 percent of voting rights through his sole ownership of 356.6 million of the company’s class B shares, according to the filing. The IPO valued his stake on paper at more than $213 million, but the share-price slump has already cut that figure by about $96 million.       Even as Canaan prepared for the November IPO, its revenue this year was declining, and its costs were expanding: The company’s revenue during the first nine months of 2019 was just $134.2 million, down from $378.5 million during all of 2018; operating costs rose to $57.5 million during the first nine months of this year, from $52.5 million for all of last year.       The investment bank Credit Suisse, initially hired by Canaan to lead the U.S. IPO, dropped off of the underwriting team just weeks before the share sale, regulatory filings show. According to a Nov. 20 prospectus, Citigroup led the remaining team of seven underwriting firms, which also included the cryptocurrency-focused financial firm Galaxy Digital.       According to the filings, the deal was also downsized in the final weeks before the sale from an initial maximum target of $400 million.       Canaan disclosed in the prospectus that it planned to use the proceeds from the stock offering for research and development related to new computer chips and to expand its artificial-intelligence and blockchain business globally, “making strategic investments and establishing overseas offices.”       To its credit, the company also disclosed the risks when the market turns anemic. “Excess inventories, inventory markdowns, brand-image deterioration and margin squeeze caused by declining economic returns for miners or pricing competition for our bitcoin-mining machines could all have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations,” according to the prospectus.       Analyzing bitcoin-mining computer stocks remains a murky practice. Just like manufacturers of oil rigs and mining bulldozers, they face the ups and downs of commodity cycles. Or rather, cryptocurrency cycles.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Bradley Keoun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/12/17/canaans-post-ipo-stock-plunge-reveals-sales-slump-price-war-with-bitmain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/64f5b57deb7bc0b202f4dd6f082209ea99e39842-1474x805.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42403707,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgYDN,1576616400,"As We Hunger for Viability, Let's Stay True to Our Values","This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Taylor Monahan is the founder and CEO of MyCrypto, which builds open-source applications that empower you to manage your digital assets safely.      There’s an old story [by James Thurber] about a bear who was, apparently, quite fond of drinking mead. This bear would drink and drink, and then return home to kick things over, knock down lamps, and ram his elbow through the window. Then, he would collapse on the floor, exhausted by the night's exuberance, and fall fast asleep. Naturally, this caused his family and friends to be quite distressed and frightened.      One day, he decided he needed to change his ways. He cleaned up and boasted to anyone who would listen about how strong and well he was without the drink. To prove his fitness, he would stand on his head and spin cartwheels and, in turn, kick things over, knock down lamps, and ram his elbow through the window. Then, he would collapse on the floor, exhausted by the night's exuberance, and fall fast asleep. And his family and friends were quite distressed and frightened still.      In a different universe, one void of drinking bears and cartwheels, we near the end of another year. While 2017 was an explosive ride ""to the moon"" and 2018 was proof that ""what goes up must come down,"" 2019 is harder to define.      It wasn't up, nor down, nor flat, nor bumpy. It wasn’t explosive, nor destructive, nor boring. As I grappled with finding a phrase to sum up an entire year, I realized that the tenor of 2019 was, overarchingly, exactly that: a year of grappling.      We grappled with understanding why no one was actually using the things we were building. We grappled with security and business models and improving the user experience. We grappled with the fact that the problems we expected people to have, may not have actually been problems. We grappled with the realization that this revolution may take longer than expected.      Interestingly, we haven't grappled with our core identity. We bicker about who is more decentralized because we all want a future free of abusive central authorities. We contend that one coin is better than another coin because we want a viable, valuable alternative to government-backed currencies to succeed. While we may disagree on the best path to the future, we share a vision of what that future holds.      However, while our ideologies and values have remained relatively intact, our focus on fighting the existing systems and bickering at each other has left those tenets vulnerable to compromise.    The heart of the bear    Once upon a time, there was an isolated kingdom with few roads. Only those who held the tools, technical prowess, and desire for knowledge were able to visit. While these people came from different places and had unique experiences, they shared similar values and thus created a new, shared experience together. They would congregate to spread ideas and engage in civil discourse. Newcomers would occasionally arrive, primarily in September, a month in which certain youths, arbitrarily deemed ready for further education, left their homes and were given the keys to access this kingdom. As is common, the newcomers were often perceived as rambunctious, but after a short period of adjustment to the existing social norms, things would carry on as they had previously.      Then one day, a newcomer built a superhighway that led directly to the kingdom. Suddenly, the kingdom was far less isolated and people began to pour in. These newcomers, like earlier newcomers, had different attitudes, opinions, and expectations but, most of all, they were of an unimaginable quantity. There was no chance of acculturation. The early visitors watched as their kingdom morphed before their eyes and the original stories and ideologies were forgotten. This has come to be known as “Eternal September” as the space originally created would never return to what it was previously.      We have always held a fear of powerful, external forces destroying what we create. The blockchain was built with this in mind and its distributed, peer-to-peer nature is simultaneously a defensive resistance and an attribute from which it derives its value. Today, it's unlikely that a single party could launch an attack that would swiftly remove us from existence, even if that party were a powerful government. But continuing to exist does not ensure that our current ethos continues to exist. It is far more likely that we morph into something that is technically the same, but fundamentally different.      In the last year, China and Facebook have both explicitly promised to give billions of people the keys to the blockchain kingdom. This kingdom would still be built using blockchain technologies, but it would not include the value, or values, that we commonly associate with the blockchain today. At its core, a blockchain is only an immutable record controlled by those who participate. It enables us to add to a record and verify this record without a single entity facilitating or authorizing the additions or verifications. In doing so, the technology prevents a single entity from controlling or manipulating the record. But, while it prevents a single entity from accruing power via the asymmetrical creation or dissemination of information, it does not dictate who is a participant, the nature of the information, the value of the record, nor what value can be further extracted on secondary layers.    The technology is only a tool. It is a brain, but not the heart.    We should not conflate the value that we create with the value a technology provides. The technology is only a tool. It is a brain, but not the heart. Just as the internet does not technically demand a certain level of discourse, the blockchain does not demand individuals are empowered or respected. Those who wield the tools determine the nature of what is built.      Even more frightening than an external invasion is that we, ourselves, may morph into something unrecognizable. As we grapple with business models, we could compromise our competitive advantage to create more attractive graphs for our pitch decks. As we grapple with attracting more users, more money, and more traction, we could sacrifice our values to compete with existing products and systems. The loss of our culture and ideologies may be caused by those inside our walls, even those we congregate with today.      In the end, it doesn't matter how it happens or who forges the road we travel down. As James Thurber’s story of the destructive bear concludes, “You might as well fall flat on your face as lean over too far backward.” The lack of drink does not ensure a lack of destruction, even if it was the original cause. Being successful in realizing one's vision requires a fight against the degradation of the ideologies and values that shape their vision, regardless of the original source of degradation.    Doubling down    In 2020, I will be doubling down on my vision of success as an individual, as a community member, and as a leader of my team and the products we build at MyCrypto. We aim to empower individuals through the sharing of knowledge and the creation of tools. It is only with knowledge that one has the ability to consent to what is done with their information and assets. It is only with the proper tools that one can take actions in one’s best interest. This consent and choice are what grants an individual sole control and, in turn, power over their actions, and ultimately, their identity.      But being the sole owner does not mean one can be a lonely owner. Relationships are a necessary and large contributor to one’s identity. Relationships and communication ensure that the sharing of knowledge is persistent and the tools wielded are consistently evolving. Power, control, and consent are not boolean nor are their movements unidirectional.      Honest discourse around the value of our creations and its alignment with our shared vision not only provides accountability for ourselves and each other, but also betters our shared experience and strengthens our shared values. We cannot go at it alone.      The future should be one where power naturally accrues to individuals. But, it is only as a group that we will have the wisdom, courage, and strength to realize that vision together.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Taylor Monahan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/12/17/as-we-hunger-for-viability-lets-stay-true-to-our-values,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e6115bd062ee3ce44b714d9e2d0a8ba7d67e7d58-1200x962.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Chen will join company as a partner to open an office in Shanghai to lead on equity investments in mainland China blockchain firms, the firm told CoinDesk.      “The creation of a presence in Shanghai demonstrates our commitment towards discovering and supporting the leading blockchain teams globally,” CMCC’s CEO Martin Baumann said in a statement shared with CoinDesk.

42403704,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgY7T,1576612264,ErisX Takes on Bakkt With Launch of Physically Settled US Bitcoin Futures,"Crypto derivatives platform ErisX is officially live with its physically settled bitcoin futures contracts, launching only the second such product suite in the U.S.      The company announced in a market notice Monday that its “Futures Digital Currency Products” would begin trading Tuesday, starting 8:00 a.m. Central Time (14:00 UTC). The marketplace’s daily trading hours run to 4:00 p.m. CT (22:00 UTC). In a pair of announcements shared exclusively with CoinDesk, the company elaborated on its new products, noting they would be trading alongside the company’s existing crypto spot exchange.      ErisX is only the second company to offer physically settled bitcoin futures in the U.S., following the launch of Intercontinental Exchange’s Bakkt futures contracts in September of this year. Cash-settled futures have been trading in the U.S. since 2017, when CME and Cboe launched their own products, though Cboe discontinued its bitcoin futures earlier this year.      According to a product page posted Monday, ErisX’s bitcoin futures will see a contract size of 0.1 bitcoin ($663 at current prices), with customers able to trade monthly or quarterly contracts at launch. Traders will have a position limit of 200,000 contracts and a minimum price increment of $1 per bitcoin (or $0.10 per contract).      While ErisX’s futures market is opening Tuesday, investors will not be able to participate through futures commission merchants or brokerages until early next year. A specific date has not yet been announced.      “We know that growth in open interest will take time and there are clear challenges ahead,” the company said in a blog post. “Introducing an intermediary market is a multi-step process, not an event, and our experience with such launches has taught us to build for longevity.”    Early adopters    Wedbush Securities is one such futures commission merchant that will participate in the marketplace, according to a statement by Wedbush executive vice president Bob Fitzsimmons.      “ErisX has taken many steps to build out their intermediary-friendly model for digital assets including the consideration of how many FCMs manage back-office processes through FIS,” he said.      ErisX currently offers spot trading services in 44 different U.S. states, with plans to add another five states and four territories (Hawaii is not on this list).      In a statement, ErisX CEO Thomas Chippas said the company met “aggressive goals” in raising funds and building out its team, as well as with developing its matching engine and futures clearing system.      “After the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) granted us a Derivatives Clearing Organization (DCO) license this summer, we have been focused on our offering and are thrilled to be ending the year with the launch of our futures market,” Chippas said.      Eris Exchange, a derivatives market provider founded in 2010, unveiled ErisX in October 2018, announcing the new crypto unit had received backing from major retail brokerage TD Ameritrade. Fidelity, Bitmain, ConsenSys and Nasdaq also participated in later funding rounds.      The company secured the regulatory licenses needed to offer futures products in the U.S. through 2018 and 2019, including its derivatives clearing organization (DCO) license in July.      ErisX will see small amounts of competition at launch, with only Bakkt offering a similar product at present. While fellow derivatives provider LedgerX is working to offer bitcoin futures products, the CFTC has yet to approve a final license for the company.      ""The launch of ErisX's fully regulated futures market is a significant development for the digital asset industry,"" E*Trade SVP Chris Larkin said in a statement.

EOS VC said Tuesday there will be no predefined criteria for a successful offer. Projects from a wide range of industries and sectors are welcome to apply, and there are no requirements for applicants to be of a certain size. Projects can be existing EOS community members or ones with plans to build on the protocol.      ""Project size is not a barrier; we welcome world conquerors and local heroes,” EOS VC said in its announcement.      Separate from EOS VC’s investment initiatives, the aim of the grant program is to improve and expand the EOS ecosystem as well as provide another funding avenue for ""promising"" projects.      Applicants will be judged on a case-by-case basis, said EOS VC, with staffers assessing a project’s business viability and how it could promote and improve the overall EOS ecosystem.

Revealed Tuesday in an ECB report, Europe's central bankers have developed an “anonymity voucher” to give prospective CBDC users limited privacy in their retail transactions.      The ECB’s “novel new concept” aims to bridge two clashing forces in the digitized payments landscape: Europeans’ desire for private transactions and regulators’ demand for anti-money-laundering (AML) enforcement.      “The ongoing digitalisation of the economy represents a major challenge for the payments ecosystem, requiring that a balance be struck between allowing a certain degree of privacy in electronic payments and ensuring compliance with regulations aimed at tackling money laundering and the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT regulations),” the report’s executive summary said.      The anonymity vouchers, issued to all account holders at a “regular interval” regardless of their account balances, could be redeemed on a one-to-one basis to shield their transactions, the report states.      Under the proposed system, if Alice wants to anonymously send CBDC tokens to Bob, Alice must hold the equivalent number of anonymity vouchers. The anonymized transactions would skip reviews from the ECB’s proposed AML Authority, the intermediary reviewing all transactions.      However, if Alice does not have enough vouchers she cannot send an anonymous transaction. The ECB said vouchers cannot be transferred between individuals, are “time-limited” and are released in limited batches by the AML Authority.      Anonymous vouchers, the report states, “are simply a technical tool used to limit the amount of CBDC that can be transferred anonymously. This means that limits on anonymous CBDC transfers can be enforced without recording the amount of CBDC that a user has spent, thereby protecting users’ privacy.”      In a tweet, the ECB hailed its research as evidence that privacy concerns and regulatory demands can coexist in a CBDC:",NEUTRAL,없음,FIAT | TRADING | RESEARCH,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2019/12/17/anonymity-vouchers-could-bring-limited-privacy-to-cbdcs-ecb-report,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/da6fcb0f7f423df3c0e3abccb8c6eb27e20c09d6-1200x801.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Levine: On Today’s episode, we’re talking State Street’s Winklevoss Moment , Blockchain Gaming, and the Ponzi Scheme Allegedly Pushing Down Bitcoin      Adam: It’s December 17, 2019, and you’re listening to Markets Daily, I’m Adam B. Levine, editor of Podcasts here At Coindesk, along with our senior markets reporter, Brad Keoun, to give you a concise daily briefing on crypto markets and some of the most important news developments in the sector over the past 24 hours.      Adam: And now, we turn to the daily bitcoin market briefing and the important news affecting the crypto industry      NEWS ROUNDUP Brad Keoun: Bitcoin up just a touch this morning, around $6900, after tumbling about 3% yesterday to the lowest level in three weeks      The news behind yesterday’s drop was apparently a Chainalysis report suggesting that the lingering fallout from the $3 billion PlusToken scam, which was busted earlier this year, may be putting downward pressure on the bitcoin market, since some of the purported perpetrators who remain at large are slowly liquidating their ill-gotten gains      CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole reports that the number of traders with bullish futures positions on the Bitfinex exchange has climbed to record highs, and that could lead to a long squeeze if prices fall another $400 to $6500      One interesting market observation today comes from Clem Chambers, CEO of the financial data website ADVFN, who says that bitcoin prices might be affected by news of President Donald Trump’s trade war with China      Of course traditional financial markets have been trading on this news, especially recently as the world’s two largest economies agreed to a phase one deal that removed the specter of new import tariffs      But Chambers argues that the recent progress toward a deal might be bad for bitcoin demand, since ostensibly fewer Chinese nationals will be looking for assets outside the reach of the trade conflict and immune from a potential devaluation of the Chinese currency, the yuan      Adam: Turning to the news, State Street, the Boston-based bank that serves as a key service provider to big money-management firms, said it has formed a partnership for a new trial with Gemini Trust, the crypto exchange and custodian founded by the Winklevoss twins      CoinDesk broke the news earlier this month that State Street had shifted its blockchain strategy and cut 40 to 100 developer jobs in the process, but it also recently released a survey suggesting that some 38 percent of its clients planned to increase digital-asset holdings next year      The new trial ultimately aims to allow investors to consolidate reporting of digital assets stored at Gemini with traditional assets serviced by State Street      Brad: Accenture, the giant consulting firm, has invested in the Marco Polo trade-finance blockchain consortium, which includes big companies like Bank of America, Mastercard, Daimler and Bank of New York Mellon      Accenture plans to work with a startup TradeIX to find new use cases for the network beyond buyers and sellers within trade finance      And speaking of big financial companies, it turns out that, despite a lot of anti-crypto rhetoric from the U.S. banking industry, the top 10 U.S. retail banks have worked with unregistered crypto money-services businesses, according to the blockchain forensics company CipherTrace      CoinDesk’s Nathan DiCamillio reports that this is the case even though some of the banks’ official position is that they don’t want any crypto-related transfers passing through their payment networks      John Jefferies, CipherTrace’s chief financial analyst says, QUOTE Whether they want to acknowledge it or not, they’re all doing crypto END OF QUOTE      And finally, the Russian state news agency TASS reported Monday that two Russian nationals have been charged with getting access to government computers and using them to mine cryptocurrencies      The report gives few details but quotes a Russian official as saying the attackers ""infected"" web pages and mined crypto currency at the moment pages were viewed in a browser      The official, Nikolay Murashov, said that companies should be on the lookout for suspicious activity on their networks, since some 80 percent of a computer’s free power can be used to generate virtual coins, and a legitimate user may not even know about it      FEATURED STORY      And for today’s featured story, we’re highlighting two reports by Decrypt.co on serious players getting into blockchain gaming. So what is Blockchain gaming? It’s basically any game which uses a blockchain to store information, anything from your wins and losses to the actual code the game is running on. Sometimes these games us Tokens to represent in-game characters, or items you might use yourself or trade to someone else.      Since 2014’s first tokenized card games, we’ve seen what have to be dozens of projects attempting to connect gaming and blockchains, with limited success. But in general these projects have been plagued by technical inaccessibility, higher costs since on-chain transactions are required, and often have focused more on creating interesting token systems than crafting fun, sustainable games. It’s not to say it hasn’t been tried, just that it’s proven very difficult to attract attention from anyone beyond technology enthusiasts, or people who are playing at least a little because they think it’s a good financial decision. It’s always been a strange combination.        So with that as background, our first story focuses on a “Evolutionary RPG” published by one of game publisher Ubisoft’s venture subsidiaries. Quoting from Decrypt:    You can now play the first game from one of Ubisoft’s handpicked blockchain startups, as Planetarium has today announced the launch of a public alpha test for decentralized PC role-playing game, Nine Chronicles. The game runs entirely on a blockchain and cannot be shut down by the developer, nor can it force through updates that players do not want.Decrypt.co  Developed by Planetarium, one of the latest companies chosen for game publisher Ubisoft’s Entrepreneur Lab program, Nine Chronicles runs entirely on a blockchain and has no centralized server. Additionally, according to Planetarium’s CEO, the open API allows players to create not only their own content, but also marketplaces to sell it. Decrypt.co    Adam: End quote      Nine Chronicles is available now in a free alpha test, if you’d like to check it out you’ll find the link in todays shownotes.      While we can’t tell if Nine Chronicles is the game that’ll help the broader concepts go mainstream, it’s instructive to note that the companies backing these plays are growing in profile.      Outside of any specific game, Decrypt is also reporting that computer chip manufacturer AMD recently joined the Blockchain Gaming Alliance, and has plans to bundle blockchain games with the sale of new graphics cards.    AMD yesterday became the first hardware manufacturer to join the Blockchain Game Alliance (BGA), a collaboration of mostly developers and publishers, which includes the likes of gaming giant Ubisoft, and Ethereum incubator ConsenSys.Decrypt.co  The hardware manufacturer also announced partnerships with Robot Cache, a blockchain-based gaming marketplace which went live in June, and Ultra, a founding BGA member which is set to launch its game-distribution platform in the next few months. Both will use AMD Ryzen processors and AMD Radeon graphics cards for “optimal cryptographic compute performance.” Robot Cache will use AMD EPYC processors in its back-end systems, while Ultra will use the same technology for block production on its network.Decrypt.co    Adam: END QUOTE      While blockchain gaming may not be there yet, these moves are significant, and this is certainly a story we’ll be following as events continue to unfold.      For AMD this isn’t just about gaming, it’s about making sure that as this sector develops, they’re a major player in it. The inclusion of blockchain games with new graphic card sales seems to be the price they’ll pay to ensure that the underlying protocols need their hardware, and for AMD that’s a bet that might pay off.      MARKET SPOTLIGHT Adam: And now, for our daily market spotlight, we’re looking at a report yesterday from the startup Chainalysis suggesting that the $3 billion PlusToken scam, busted earlier this year, might be pushing down prices for bitcoin.      Brad: That’s right Adam, today we’re looking at what might be a major factor in the bitcoin market - the fallout from the PlusToken scam busted earlier this year      Now PlusToken was a South Korean exchange and high-yield investment program, started in 2018, offering a wallet service and promising 8% to 16% on stored funds, and it may have attracted as many as 3 million users, largely in South Korea and China      The operation allegedly had some of the telltale signs of a ponzi scheme, with members encouraged to recruit new members, and in doing so could obtain honorable distinctions like “Big Boy” and “Great God”      But in June, withdrawals from the app were frozen, and six allegedly high-ranking members of the operations were arrested on the Pacific island nation of Vanuatu, and they were ultimately extradited to China to face charges      One of the transactions from their wallets contained a note saying QUOTE Sorry, we have run” END-QUOTE according to CryptoBriefing      According to Chanalysis, a blockchain forensics and compliance firm, some $2 billion of cryptocurrency may have been taken from victims      And due to the transparency of transactions on the blockchain, it’s been possible to watch as these cryptocurrencies moved around the various networks, with the looters apparently trying to cash out      And the theory now is that some of their bitcoin sales might be putting downward pressure on prices      Traders in the bitcoin market became aware of this dynamic in November, but the story is getting fresh attention now after Chainalysis published its report yesterday      Chainanalysis has built up a credible reputation for using its blockchain skills to help fight crime      This is the same firm that in October announced that it had assisted the U.S. Department of Justice in the world's largest reported shutdown of a child pornography ring      According to Chainanalysis, the funds from the PlusToken scam appear to have been moved around various blockchain networks and crypto exchanges using sophisticated techniques designed to hide the origin of the transactions and also blending funds with other funds that were not involved in the PlusToken scheme      Some transactions went through over-the-counter brokers with light know-your-customer requirements, which make it easier for traders to conceal their identities from exchanges and authorities      Chainalysis claims $185 million in stolen bitcoin have already been liquidated by individuals related to PlusToken, and the theory is that these transactions have contributed to bitcoin’s price decline to about $6900 now from as high as $13000 in June      While Chainalysis wouldn’t say for certain that liquidations from PlusToken-related accounts sunk bitcoin’s price, the blockchain forensics firm was willing to claim “that those cashouts cause increased volatility in Bitcoin’s price, and that they correlate significantly with Bitcoin price drops.”      According to Chainanalysis, the dynamic continues to haunt the bitcoin market, since some $150 million of allegedly illicit proceeds from the scam has yet to be cashed out      The other big takeaway, according to Chainalysis, is that this is just another episode that paints the crypto industry in a negative light, which could scare off big institutional investors who might otherwise want to allocate some money to bitcoin      Adam: Join us again on Wednesday, for the next Markets Daily from Coindesk.

42403711,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgYBP,1576594800,Jake Chervinsky: I'm Surprised There Haven't Been More Enforcement Actions This Year,"This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Jake Chervinsky serves as general counsel at Compound and an adjunct professor at Georgetown University Law Center.      Jake Chervinsky is a lawyer, but not yours.      Now general counsel for Compound, a decentralized lending protocol, Chervinsky began his early career investigating and litigating white-collar financial crimes. This experience, coupled with having graduated law school during the midst of the most recent global recession, soured his view of the banking industry.      ""When I learned about bitcoin, it struck me as an engineering solution to what I saw as a whole group of intractable political problems – misaligned incentives, rent-seeking behavior, disrespect for privacy rights,"" he said. In 2018, he joined the crypto team at Kobre & Kim, a boutique law firm that specializes in fraud and misconduct, and ""never looked back.""      Cryptocurrency may well prevent financial crimes in the future, but for now, the industry is still figuring out its own legal concerns. I sent a few questions to Chervinsky over email, to get his take on what the regulatory actions of 2019 mean for tomorrow.      Do you think 2019 brought clarity to any open legal and regulatory concerns for the industry?      This year did provide some clarity regarding how US laws and regulations apply to digital assets, thanks largely to important guidance from the SEC on investment contract analysis, FinCEN on anti-money laundering compliance, OFAC on trade sanctions compliance, and the IRS on taxation. Unfortunately, we still have many more open questions than we have answers. It's become increasingly clear that some of our financial regulations – which were designed for a pre-internet age – aren’t well-suited to the novel and unique issues raised by the crypto industry. Alas, these issues can’t be resolved by non-binding guidance from regulators and enforcement agencies either. Without formal rule-making or crypto-specific legislation, I expect that we'll continue to struggle with regulatory uncertainty.      There are a lot of conflicting opinions about the sanctions weighed against Block.One. I know this is a case you kept a close eye on. Do you think there's room for further litigation?      I think the penalties assessed by the SEC against Block.One were reasonable in light of the complexity of the case and helpful for clarifying the SEC’s views on how and when digital tokens can evolve from securities to non-securities. Some have criticized the SEC for accepting what looks like a small penalty compared to the amount of money Block.One raised, but that criticism ignores the reality of settlement negotiations in government enforcement matters. By definition, settlement requires the government to discount the defendant’s maximum potential liability to account for the chance of losing in litigation.      Considering the time and resources required to pursue a contested enforcement action, combined with all the arguments and defenses that Block.One could have advanced, I think the settlement was appropriate for both parties. Perhaps more importantly for the future, as I explained before, the settlement implies that the SEC does not view EOS tokens as securities based on the current state of the EOS network. I’d be surprised if the SEC goes after Block.One again, but it’s possible that other regulators or enforcement agencies could pursue separate enforcement actions.    The term 'scam' has been greatly overused in the context of ICOs, most of which were simply doomed-to-fail business concepts.    At what point should an ICO be deemed a scam?      I believe we should only use the term “scam” to describe outright frauds – that is, the intentional use of trickery, deceit, or other dishonest means to deprive people of their rightful money or property. In my view, the term “scam” has been greatly overused in the context of ICOs, most of which were simply doomed-to-fail business concepts rather than overtly fraudulent schemes.      Do you think the SEC be over reliant on sanctions?      I don’t think the SEC has been overly reliant on enforcement actions, and in fact, I’m surprised that the SEC hasn’t launched more enforcement actions against ICO projects that sold tokens in 2017. The ICO bubble involved hundreds (or thousands) of unregistered securities issuances in which US investors lost millions (or billions) of dollars, but most of them have escaped SEC enforcement up to this point.      When do you suppose a security becomes a commodity and escapes the SEC’s purview?      To be precise, securities don’t “become commodities” – securities are a type of commodity regulated by the SEC instead of the CFTC. A security of the “investment contract” variety becomes a non-security when the facts and circumstances change in a way that negates one or more prongs of the Howey Test. For example, if the financial success of a digital token no longer depends on the managerial or entrepreneurial efforts of a specific third party or promoter, the token should cease to be classified as a security.      Why might the SEC be delaying a bitcoin ETF?      The SEC refuses to approve a bitcoin ETF due to market manipulation concerns. The law only allows the SEC to approve ETFs that are “designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices.” For years, the SEC has said that a bitcoin ETF sponsor can only satisfy this requirement by entering “surveillance-sharing agreements with regulated markets of significant size,” but unfortunately no sponsor has been able to clear that hurdle yet. There is some dispute about whether the SEC is interpreting this requirement correctly, but unless someone decides to challenge them in court, their view will remain the law of the land.      What was the biggest event of the year, crypto-wise?      The most influential event of this year was the announcement – and ensuing regulatory persecution – of Facebook's Libra project. Before Libra, crypto wasn’t on the radar of most US government officials, but Facebook’s attempt to cloak its pivot to financial services in the language of decentralization brought an unprecedented level of attention to our industry. We’re now seeing efforts in Congress to advance legislation that targets Libra without fully considering the collateral damage to crypto. For example, the recently-proposed ""Managed Stablecoins are Securities Act of 2019"" could have catastrophic consequences for US crypto companies as well as the nation’s ability to compete in this global industry.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2019/12/17/jake-chervinsky-im-surprised-there-havent-been-more-enforcement-actions-this-year,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b8fa733b2fe6036a9729c647258b8a0c7deac19d-1048x821.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Announced Monday, the IOM said it would begin using the International Recruitment Integrity System – Self-Assessment for Ethical Recruitment (IRIS-SAFER), a blockchain solution designed to add greater transparency to the recruitment process in Hong Kong and countries of origin for migrant workers.      Developed in partnership with Diginex, a Hong Kong-based blockchain firm, IRIS-SAFER will be used initially by up to 1,500 recruitment agencies. The hope is it will serve as a practical solution for businesses to adopt ethical recruitment practices, in line with the IRIS Standard, a set of rules designed to promote and support ethical recruitment practices around the globe.      “We are excited to have identified an opportunity by which IOM can support migrant worker recruitment agencies to differentiate themselves as good actors,” explained Giuseppe Crocetti, IOM China’s chief of mission.      As it's based on an immutable ledger, U.N. officials will be able to use IRIS-SAFER to accurately monitor progress from participating recruitment agencies. The IOM plans to introduce the system to other jurisdictions around the globe following the Hong Kong roll-out.      There are more than 390,000 domestic migrant workers in the Hong Kong area, approximately one-tenth of the population, according to the last census. A recent survey found 58 percent of these had been charged illegal fees by recruitment agencies.      “Using the U.N.’s IRIS standards as the benchmark for reputable agencies, we are confident that the tool can help to strike out these unethical practises,” said Mark Blick, Diginex's head of government solutions. “In Hong Kong, foreign domestic workers are some of the most economically vulnerable people in our society and pay approximately HK$700,000,000 [approximately $89.9 million] each year in placement/recruitment fees.”      Some U.N. officials have suggested that blockchain, and cryptocurrencies in particular, raise whole new obstacles, especially when it comes to crime prevention. That said, other wings of the international organization have already started experimenting with the technology.      The U.N. Capital Development Fund and the U.N.

42403708,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgYAQ,1576584000,What Bitcoin Means for Athletes Like Me,"This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Russell Okung, ""The Bitcoin Cleats Guy,"" is a philanthropist, entrepreneur, social activist and Super Bowl champion left tackle with the Los Angeles Chargers. Okung is a passionate advocate of bitcoin and blockchain technology and the founder of BitcoinIs_.      I’ve recently become the “bitcoin guy” in the locker room, complete with both ridicule and intrigue. My teammates are understandably curious about why I’m suddenly so into this “magic internet money” called bitcoin. The truth is, long before I tweeted “Pay Me in Bitcoin,” I’d become increasingly exhausted by constant struggle, endless conflict and the frequent absence of hope.      These days, I’m more interested in finding a solution that can be immediately implemented without first gaining permission, or proving my abilities (again), or articulating the worthiness of my peers to skeptics. As leaders, we have so much more to offer society than a few hours of weekly entertainment. I am hungry for long term, sustainable solutions that can demonstrate that our economic power is not only real, but vastly undervalued and overlooked.      Bitcoin is that solution. Allow me to provide some background on this and then I’ll explain why I believe so strongly in bitcoin.      By this point in my professional football career, I’ve learned that economic power isn’t as straightforward as simply having money. Optics and circumstances often dictate how economic power is understood and how it’s wielded. For instance, winning the lottery may put $100 million in your bank account, but it doesn’t suddenly make you a financial expert. Similarly, being born into wealth may give you unearned financial freedom, but your peers will be skeptical of that wealth until you demonstrate an aptitude to steward it properly.      I am puzzled when the financial circumstances of professional athletes, especially black athletes, are viewed with optics similar to the lottery winner or the silver-spooner. It’s confusing when our economic power isn’t more naturally compared to the traditional entrepreneur who demonstrated the same gumption and exerted similar energy in their own field with dedication, sacrifice, long hours and a hyper-focus on the end-goal.      Bitcoin is a direct threat to that economic power. In fact, one of the main reasons that bitcoin hasn’t fully captured the mainstream consciousness is because it’s a direct threat to the current order. In other words, those who currently sit at the top of the socioeconomic hierarchy of our world are not incentivized by the inevitable success of bitcoin. Conversely, there are many who will see their fortunes significantly reduced as global economic turmoil continues to escalate, the dollar continues to weaken, and inflation reaches levels not previously imagined.    I’m playing my role in raising awareness, shamelessly encouraging professional athletes to embrace bitcoin    Bitcoin is one of the few financial assets that offers sanctuary from a global recession, when it arrives. Financial advisor isn’t recommending bitcoin because they don’t make money by selling it to clients. The mainstream talking heads don’t mention it because it threatens their cushy industry. But we are on the precipice of something truly unique with the invention and success of bitcoin. I’m playing my role in raising awareness, shamelessly encouraging professional athletes to embrace bitcoin, and evangelizing to a mainstream audience about the opportunity we have to capture undeniable economic power.      Bitcoin is like digital gold. No one entity owns it or controls it. It is a scarce asset, which means there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins in existence. It has a proven 11-year track record that is unmatched by any Silicon Valley unicorn. Bitcoin is undermining the status quo of intermediaries: no more banks, no more money managers, no more governments telling you what you can and can’t do with your money. For me, it means sending money to a relative in Nigeria without asking for approval from anyone else. Imagine an economy that doesn’t require you to share all your personal details before making a purchase. Imagine a retirement plan that isn’t built on a foundation that is “too big to fail.”      Professional athletes committed themselves to becoming elite workers in their industry, investing significant human capital to earn their place in society. Bitcoin offers a way to protect that hard earned capital from the whims of central bankers who keep printing more money to bail out their friends on Wall Street. It is time for us to embrace our economic sovereignty by allocating at least 5% of our wealth into bitcoin. I’m personally much more invested in the asset, but my goal here is to simply get you off of zero. Of course, I want to see the price go up, but I gain nothing else by trying to make you a believer. I just think it is important to let you know now, so you don’t blame me down the line when the price skyrockets and the global recession is no longer deniable.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Russell Okung,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/12/17/what-bitcoin-means-for-athletes-like-me,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6206a7b6fe5e8f329442f79b9ad319a4d7af9064-1228x786.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42403698,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgY2Y,1576584000,UK's Oldest Crypto Exchange to Delist Ethereum and Focus Solely on Bitcoin,"Coinfloor, the U.K.’s longest-running cryptocurrency exchange, plans to delist ethereum next month, citing an unclear future of hard forks and the need for onerous technical support for the second-biggest coin by market capitalization.      The company will also delist bitcoin cash, the splinter currency founded two years ago in the aftermath of bitcoin’s heated scaling debate. Starting Jan. 3, Coinfloor will support only bitcoin, whose eleventh anniversary happens to fall on that day.      The plan comes ahead of the launch of ethereum 2.0, tentatively planned for early 2020, which will begin the process of shifting the network away from the energy-consuming proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake (PoS).      Coinfloor’s decision suggests that nurturing a team with the specific expertise to follow the technical trials and tribulations of coins like ethereum may be too expensive for smaller crypto players, particularly if this constitutes only a small part of their trading volume.      From the point at which it starts next year, ethereum’s platform upgrade “could take years to complete,” said Obi Nwosu, founder and CEO of Coinfloor. The complexity of the operation “means for a period of time there could be two versions of ethereum running.”      According to some ethereum developers, it’s likely to be years before the old ethereum PoW chain is fully merged into the new PoS network, leading to current discussions around ways to create a secure bridge between the two chains.      Founded in 2013, Coinfloor is a small exchange, with 24-hour volume of trading between bitcoin and GBP at just $450,000, according to CoinMarketCap, compared to $1.5 million of BTC/GBP at Coinbase Pro.      In Nwosu’s opinion, the headache of accommodating ethereum's planned upgrades was not worth a diminutive increase in overall trading volumes.      “You have to maintain that currency, every time they make an update or a change, and ethereum has got a long way to go with updates and changes to the platform,” Nwosu said.      Coinfloor, which is licensed by the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and has access to the country’s Faster Payments Service for instant fiat deposits and withdrawals, waited for regulatory certainty around ethereum before finally listing the token around the end of last year. Trading in ethereum comprises a tiny fraction of the exchange’s volume which is predominantly bitcoin, Nwosu said.      Similar considerations informed Coinfloor’s decision to delist bitcoin cash.      “In terms of traction compared to bitcoin, [bitcoin cash] has gone from a third of the market cap to one-tenth of market cap over last year. So it was under a certain level of support and interest for us to expend resources on listing it,” Nwosu said.      As it doubles down on bitcoin, Coinfloor will also explore new avenues in areas such as lending in the coming year, Nwosu said.",NEGATIVE,없음,BCH | ETH | EXCHANGE | TRADING | FORKS,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/12/17/uks-oldest-crypto-exchange-to-delist-ethereum-and-focus-solely-on-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2a4740e6d3678b243e05aef18edc902e18952bd9-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Boston-based State Street Corp. announced Tuesday that it's partnering with cryptocurrency exchange and custodian Gemini Trust on a new pilot that examines reporting scenarios for digital assets.      The trial will track a reporting process for bitcoin and ether that are held for a user in Gemini's custody service. The cryptocurrencies were chosen for reasons of liquidity, according to a press release, but other digital assets can be added to the system, including tokenized securities.      Claimed to be the first trial of its kind, the effort is ultimately aimed to allow investors to consolidate the reporting of digital assets stored at Gemini with traditional assets serviced by State Street.      ""With trillions of dollars in assets under management, State Street will never compromise on security – and neither will we,"" said Gemini CEO Tyler Winklevoss. ""Traditional investors will more seamlessly be able to allocate capital in their portfolio to digital assets through trusted and regulated financial institutions — helping us build a better bridge to the future of money.""      The announcement comes soon after State Street said 38 percent of its clients planned to increase their holdings of digital assets in 2020. As such, the bank is focusing on digital assets going forward, having recently cut back on its blockchain work with the loss of around 100 related development jobs.      “There is small, but growing demand from our clients for solutions of this type and many technical, operational, regulatory, and legal considerations to be addressed,"" said Ralph Achkar, managing director of Digital Product Development and Innovation at State Street. ""That is why we have opted for an open model, and started a pilot with Gemini as an established, regulated player in the digital asset space.”      The two firms already have a business relationship, with State Street acting as the custodian of the dollar collateral backing Gemini's GUSD stablecoin.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | SPONSORED,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/12/17/state-street-teams-up-with-winklevoss-founded-gemini-exchange-for-digital-assets-trial,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/07b265af64f68f198e0efdbcb8c978a1a34c2a8b-1491x746.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403703,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgY4W,1576580400,Bitcoin Price Hits 3-Week Low Even as Investor Bets on a Bull Move Surge,"View  Bitcoin's drop to three-week lows has bolstered the bearish setup and opened the doors for a re-test of November lows near $6,500.  A drop to $6,500 could trigger a long squeeze, yielding a deeper drop in prices. However, bitcoin long positions have hit record highs on the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex.  A minor bounce to $7,100 may be seen before a deeper drop.  A UTC close above $7,870 is needed to confirm a short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change.    Bitcoin continues to dial back gains seen in the last week of November amid a parabolic rise in bullish bets on the cryptocurrency.      The premier cryptocurrency fell to $6,828 on Monday to print the lowest level since Nov. 25 and was last seen changing hands near $6,900, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.      With the drop to three-week lows, bitcoin has erased 76 percent of the corrective bounce from lows near $6,500 to $7,870 witnessed in the five days to Nov. 29.      While the cryptocurrency is losing ground, the number of bullish bets, as represented by the BTC/USD long positions on Bitfinex, have jumped to a record high of 44,523 contracts, surpassing the previous high of 40,193 reached in March 2018. Meanwhile, short positions have remained stuck largely in the 5,000–8,000 range.      As can be seen (above left), longs have increased by 78 percent in the last three weeks.      Interestingly, bullish bets began rising on Nov. 24 – a day before BTC bounced from six-month lows near $6,500 (above right) – and have continued to surge despite the recent pullback.      It's likely that the sharp rise in longs represents traders who believe the cryptocurrency has made a major bottom near $6,500.      If that level comes into play again, investors may panic and square off (sell) their long positions, leading to deeper losses (a long squeeze).      Popular analyst Josh Rager thinks bitcoin will drop to $6,500, but after a minor bounce.      Meanwhile, Jacob Canfield, a guest trader on Forbes and CNBC, has forecast $5,500 as the bottom of the ongoing downtrend, which began from highs above $13,800 reached at the end of June.    Daily chart    Bitcoin violated support at $7,087 over the weekend and fell 3.27 percent on Monday, reinforcing the bearish view put forward by a lower high at $7,870 created on Nov. 29.      The descending 5- and 10-day averages and the below-50 reading on the relative strength index (RSI) indicate the path of least resistance is to the downside. The MACD histogram has also crossed below zero, confirming the bearish trend.      As such, bitcoin appears to be on track to test the Nov. 25 low of $6,511.    4-hour chart    The RSI on the 4-hour chart is currently below 30, signaling oversold conditions. Hence, a minor bounce may be seen before the potential drop to lows near $6,500 suggested by the daily chart.      A corrective bounce, if any, would likely fade around the descending 10-day MA, currently at $7,166.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/12/17/bitcoin-price-hits-3-week-low-even-as-investor-bets-on-a-bull-move-surge,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7115a8ed1c2e75f33239d08531e169f21454aa92-1500x997.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403706,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgY9R,1576576800,"We Made No Progress, Other Than All the Progress We Made","This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Lex Sokolin is Global Fintech Co-Head at ConsenSys, a Brooklyn-based blockchain software company.      It looks like we haven’t gotten very far! It’s been ten years of magical internet money, and the best we can show for it is Twitter tipping?      On the other hand, maybe we have gotten really far! Decentralized financial protocols are pumping out unfiltered peer-to-peer trading, margin lending, and synthetic structured products. Financial manufacturing machines are converting cash money into virtual money, and real estate, cartoon cats, regulated securities, with hundreds of millions of notional corporate bonds and payments and invoice securitizations done by the world’s largest banks on public, private, and open source blockchains.      Of course, there also are the people who have been sued and gone to jail, or lost their life savings, or disappeared, or paid $24 million in fines for unregistered security offerings. There are the Ponzi schemers and the pyramid marketers and the Twitter botnet kings. A grain of beautiful truth has been placed squarely on a throne of artifice and innovation theatre, spinning wildly while people yell their unbridled emotions into the abyss. Rat Poison Squared! Code is Law!    China’s sword of blockchain and AI will ring against the shield of American regulation in the century to come.    And then we have power. America is flexing its black letter law and alphabet soup of pre-war regulatory bodies. The CFTC and the SEC agree to split securities from commodities, unless they are moving around a bit and regulated by FinCEN or touch New York State and its BitLicense. Don’t forget that if you do banking or lending – looking at you, hot DeFi stuff – the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) may think you are a bank, and their lenient fintech charter was overturned in court. European power has been slightly more amenable, with its Brexit stroke encouraging each side of the body to compete for most favourable tintech nation.      But even hungrier power is around the corner. Facebook, looking at its 2.3 billion users and seeing Ant Financial in the rear mirror, has maximized the attention its artificial intelligence machine can syphon. After solving the problem of online loneliness and the human need for friends, it seeks to liberate human-kind from poverty and launches Libra. To date, Facebook has been a techno nation. Now it tries to be a state, and both the Americans and the Chinese notice. Unlike the former, the latter grab risky innovation as a national priority – putting hundreds of billions of yuan to work on next-generation infrastructure. China’s sword of blockchain and AI will ring against the shield of American regulation in the century to come.    Progress is like water    So yeah, nothing’s really happened.      What I mean to say is that progress is like water. It flows around the barriers of human society, washing away at the soft parts in our beliefs and structures, and then, just at the right time, collapses away some arcane thinking in favor of the new. Sometimes, like in AI, it takes 50 years of little drips and multiple false starts to get anywhere meaningful. But once you arrive, the technology is everywhere. Also, sometimes, like in crypto, there is a magnificent spotlight on the industry. We have been lucky to work with a technology people can easily own and trade. It has been our greatest weakness as well.    Hundreds of billions of dollars have poured into making the distribution of financial products easier. Yet, nothing real has changed in the manufacturing of financial instruments, until now.    When I look at the next decade of blockchain-based systems and decentralized protocols, I see far less focus on the asset class, and far more focus on operating progress within the chassis of human technology. To build a capital markets business that treats software units of bitcoin, ethereum and the rest as financial instruments is a great first goal. I would posit that we are already there. From custody to exchanges to broker/dealers, and eventually integrated robo-advisors and fintech apps – this stuff is being solved fast, and by companies large and small. Between Fidelity’s institutional solutions, Coinbase’s American consumer dominance, and Binance’s global presence, we have the initial use-cases covered. These stacks are hundreds of competitors deep, with many doing strong work. Yes, more merchants should accept BTC or DAI or USDC. But this, too, shall come to pass.      Each day I wake up with an obsession. It is a simple one: all financial services infrastructure will be powered by open source programmable blockchains. Over the last decade, hundreds of billions of dollars have poured into making the distribution of financial products easier. Just look at your phone, from Revolut to Robinhood to Venmo to Betterment to Sofi and TransferWise. These apps have broadened the retail footprint and collapsed pricing in everything from banking to investments. And yet, nothing real has changed in the manufacturing of financial instruments, until now.      Think about our financial infrastructure— how we make deposits, or underwrite loans, or invest our pensions— and how it is governed by entirely separate regimes and supported by disconnected software platforms and value chains. Massive public companies like Visa, FIS, Fiserv, Envestnet, Temenos, Broadridge and others power the hum of institutional finance. Some of their infrastructures are so old that developers who understand the code that these systems are written in have mostly retired or passed. Just Google COBOL!      Hundreds of billions of enterprise value and trillions in money flows are waiting for the type of digitization that only blockchain-native companies can accomplish. At ConsenSys Codefi, which I co-lead out of London, we are focused on building this bridge using public and private ethereum. In the beginning, industries are comfortable mutualizing their data and the standards around them. Next, they contribute workflows and intellectual property into these shared systems. Tokenization follows, giving the workflows a meaningful object with which to interact. This is where most of the world is today.      But tomorrow, tokens are not just representations of some chunky legal document sitting printed and signed on a corporate lawyer’s desk. They are programmable, fully-featured financial instruments that perform corporate functions, distribute dividends, enable governance, rebalance portfolios, adjust risk exposure, provide provenance and audit data, self-administer, and instantly settle. They can live in your enterprise cloud, and in your phone, and on printed-out QR codes. This tomorrow is much closer than you think.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Lex Sokolin,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/12/17/we-made-no-progress-other-than-all-the-progress-we-made,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/10a15c7b1500eba09babb8104f6a5168d70be0b2-2500x2143.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403709,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgYCO,1576573200,Blockchain Startup Conflux to Get Shanghai Government Funding for Research Institute,"Senior Shanghai government officials have agreed to help blockchain startup Conflux open a research institute and incubation center with millions of dollars, the firm's co-founder said.  The Beijing-based firm counts Sequoia China and Huobi among several prominent backers, raising $35 million via a private token sale in December 2018.  The research institute will be open later in December at the earliest, while the incubation center could be launched in June 2020.  The move comes amid the city’s crackdown on crypto businesses.    A 10,000-square-meter working site, a sizable fund and an opening ceremony attended by city officials. That’s when you know the Chinese government has your back.      The Shanghai government has agreed to open a research institute with blockchain startup Conflux as early as the end of this December, while considering an incubation center that could be set up in June 2020, Fan Long, co-founder of Conflux, told CoinDesk.      While declining to disclose the exact amount of funding that Conflux is set to get from the local government, Long said it will be in the millions of dollars.      The Shanghai Science and Technology Committee, part of the municipal government, confirmed to CoinDesk it met with Conflux on Oct. 29 to discuss government support for the institute and the incubator. An official from the committee’s technology incubation office was unable to discuss the timeline or the funding for the projects.      The move comes as the government continues to crack down on cryptocurrency firms that had mushroomed after Chinese President Xi Jinping’s speech praising blockchain. The Shanghai bureau of China’s central bank went so far as to say it would “nip young crypto businesses in the bud.” Beijing is promoting innovation, but only the kind it thinks it can control.      Nevertheless, the Conflux Incubation Center aims to invite developers and entrepreneurs to build decentralized applications (dapps) on the public permissionless blockchain developed by the firm. Like bitcoin and ethereum, that blockchain is public, so anyone can participate, and it uses a similar proof-of-work mechanism to reach consensus on the state of the ledger and to secure the network.      “Our infrastructure for the dapps is different from ethereum and will have its own ecosystem,” said the firm’s global marketing manager, Christian Oertel, noting Conflux primarily focuses on improving its network’s scalability and building a network of global developers.      On top of the mandate to find venture capital firms for startups, the incubation center would develop dapps for the Shanghai government.      “We can have dapps to help the government track funds and documents to address some of the challenges it is facing in the process,” Oertel said.      Besides an office building in Hongqiao, one of the busiest business districts in the west of Shanghai, and the multi-million dollar funding, the city will dole out subsidies to support the research institute and incubation center, according to Oertel.      While declining to reveal who initiated the partnership, Oertel said Conflux has been in talks with the Shanghai government since July.      Young but well-funded    Formed in 2018, the budding company has raised $35 million from a slew of prominent investors in China, including private equity firm Sequoia China, Huobi Group, Shunwei Capital and Rong360.      “Conflux started as a research project. We initially were just trying to find a way to scale up blockchain that could make it faster and more secure,” Long said. “When the investors got interested, we felt it might be a good idea to bring the technologies out of our laboratory.”      The financing round took place through a private token sale, and Conflux will launch its mainnet, or live blockchain, in the first quarter of next year, allowing developers to mine the native token CFX, Oertel said.      One thing Conflux stressed to CoinDesk repeatedly in the interview is it will not launch an initial coin offering (ICO) or be involved in any form of centralized token sales. Oertel said it is up to token holders to decide if they want to trade them on exchanges such as Binance, outside the Conflux network.      Conflux has 50 employees and half of the team works on the firm's technology development. The 24-person tech team includes six founding members, 12 engineers and six on the global team, across the world.      The firm has been looking for talent with a mix of Chinese and international education, according to the firm. Most of the current employees went to top engineering schools in China and studied abroad for their graduate degrees, according to the firm’s website.      “Our Beijing office is close to Tsinghua University. It is convenient for us to recruit talent,” the spokesperson said.      At least 10 out of Conflux’ 18-member development team, including founders Fan Long and David Chow, have earned either bachelor or graduate degrees from Tsinghua University. Its research scientist Wei Xu and chief scientist Chi-Chih Yao, a Turing Aaward winner, are faculty members of the university.      “The Chinese government realizes public blockchain is important,” Long said. “They [the government] felt like it would be great if there is some team with a Chinese connection, which makes them feel more close to, so they could support building the ecosystem.”    Decentralized public chain    “A lot of people think doing public chain is illegal or something bad in China,” Long said. “The next level of development for blockchain will be to attract people to work on it and no one wants to work on something that they are not sure whether it is legal or not.""      However, the government realizes it is difficult to prevent the use of public and alliance blockchains, according to Long.      “Blockchain is always associated with validated information and any validated valuable information could be digital assets whether they are on public or alliance blockchain,” Long said.. “If you have digital assets, they could be traded. The government is aware of this.”      While fully embracing distributed ledger technologies and consortium blockchains, China approaches permissionless and decentralized networks in a much more cautious manner since they could be used for centralized exchanges.      In October, the Chinese government revealed more than 500 enterprise blockchain projects launched by state-owned banks, tech companies and government agencies, whereas few decentralized public chains have received the government’s blessing.      Yifeng Zhang, the head of Hangzhou Blockchain Technology Research Institute, said public permissioned blockchain is the best chance for the industry to commercialize the technology, during the 2019 Digital Economy Innovation Summit in October.      One of the few public permissionless blockchains that is closely working with the state-owned entities is Nervos’ two-layer network with an application sidechain. The firm completed its 72 million token sale and launched its mainnet in November.      Backed by MultiCoin, Polychain Capital and Shenzhen-based China Merchants Bank International (CMBI), the firm has been working with CMBI, which is partly owned by the Chinese government, on decentralized finance applications.      The funding from the government is not the most important, Long said. It is the official support from the Shanghai government that makes the partnership valuable for Conflux.    Bloodbath of crypto exchanges    Speaking of the city’s recent crackdown on crypto exchanges, Long said the move is good in the sense that it clears out some of the illegal centralized exchanges.      While it is a good thing that centralized exchanges provide liquidity for crypto assets, some of them are now hurting the reputation of the whole blockchain industry. “The majority of the bad things happening in this blockchain space have been associated directly or indirectly with centralized exchanges,” Long said.      As the Chinese government slowly but surely warms to decentralized public chains, it still keeps the market shut from crypto exchanges.      In November, megacities Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen announced city-wide crackdowns on crypto exchanges and any marketing firms that promote such businesses.      President Xi’s praise in October for blockchain prompted many companies to explore blockchain technologies in a bid to raise money through an ICO. As many as 25,000 blockchain companies out of 28,000 across the blockchain industry might have tried raise funding via centralized token sales, according to an official from the Beijing Blockchain Application Association.      To curb that development, the Chinese government has cracked down on some of the largest crypto exchanges operated within the country, including upstart exchanges BISS and Matcha.      While China accused those exchanges of fraud or violating foreign exchange regulations, bigger players have pivoted to blockchain services in the country or transferred crypto businesses to other countries with more flexible regulations.      The Chinese branch of Huobi Group exited its crypto trading businesses from China in 2017 while expanding operations in other countries including South Korea, Japan and Turkey.    Blockchain for all and the trade war    Beyond Shanghai’s push to develop blockchain technologies, China has been pushing for a blockchain network that has a scale large enough to provide basic public services across the country.      Led by the State Information Center, affiliated with China’s highest economic central planning agency the National Development and Research Commission, state-owned tech giants China Mobile, China UnionPay and China Telecom jointly announced a plan to test the Blockchain-Based Service Network (BSN) in October.      The network is envisioned to be used for everything from smart city management to telecommunications. The builders hope it will become as popular among blockchain developers as the Android or IOS operating systems are among app makers.      In November, a 14-member consortium, including Huobi China, was formed to develop and operate the network. BSN is set to be tested in about 200 cities as well as Hong Kong and Singapore.      The spirit of self-made innovation comes amid the growing distrust derived from the trade war between the U.S. and China.      Silicon Valley startup incubator Y Combinator closed its China unit in November amid the tension over trade and intellectual property in the technology sector in November, although the company said the closure is not related to the trade war, according to a Reuters report.",POSITIVE,CFX,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | RESEARCH | CFX | TOKEN SALE,David Pan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/12/17/blockchain-startup-conflux-to-get-shanghai-government-funding-for-research-institute,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a559cf15a69f3cb8710cf32bd5b96dfebf223a2a-1500x1035.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The agreement comes alongside an undisclosed investment by Accenture Ventures in TradeIX, the companies announced Tuesday. Accenture will help TradeIX create new use cases beyond banking for buyers and sellers within trade finance.      “As we talked to more corporates it became apparent there was more that we could be doing,” said Robert Barnes, CEO and co-founder of TradeIX. “We’re looking to enhance the data between buyer and seller … including inventory information, invoice and purchase orders, advance and shipping orders and working with contracts on the chain.”      Accenture is a strategic partner with Marco Polo ahead of the network’s launch in 2020 and will help corporations integrate their legacy technology with the blockchain system.      “We’re processing many of these transactions already, leading the way with AI, analytics and automation to get to a more streamlined processing,” Melanie Cutlan, managing director of blockchain services for Accenture Operations said. “With DLT, Accenture has been focused on financial services infrastructure, supply chain and digital identity – this hits the core of all three of those.”      Last week, TradeIX announced that the Marco Polo network completed its largest open-account trade finance trial to date with more than 70 organizations. Since its unveiling, the network has added a number of major names in finance and related industries, with Bank of America, Mastercard and automaker Daimler joining the network in September. In November, Bank of New York Mellon became the 28th bank to join the network.
