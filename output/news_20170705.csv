42400106,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAc22NP,1499292933,Ethereum Traders File Class Action Lawsuit Over Kraken Flash Crash,"A class-action lawsuit has been filed against cryptocurrency exchange startup Kraken over issues stemming from its management of a May flash crash.  Less than two months later, five customers of the exchange are alleging negligence, breach of contract and unjust enrichment, arguing that Kraken should have suspended trading amidst a denial-of-service (DDoS) attack that impacted its operations.  Newly filed court documents name five plaintiffs, including one in the US, two in Israel and two others based in the UK, while Payward Inc, which does business as Kraken, is named as the sole defendant. Between the five customers, a total of 3,414.078 ETH – an amount worth roughly $329,000 at a price of $96.32 – was liquidated.  That amount is equal to about $911,000 at press time.  Social media  reports at the time attest to a plunge in the price of ether, the cryptocurrency of the ethereum network, on the exchange's order books, with market data from CryptoCoinCharts.info showcasing how prices touched a low of $26, resulting in a wave of liquidations.  In the aftermath, some customers complained that their positions had been unfairly sold, with others going as far as to allege manipulation. The following day, Kraken released a statement on the incident, remarking that an internal investigation ""did not find any evidence of a coordinated attack or market manipulation"" and that its internal systems had operated normally.  At the time, Kraken said that it would not move to pay back users, apologizing for the losses but stating it ""cannot compensate traders for the outcome of naturally occurring events in the market, nor losses due to unavoidable DDoS attacks.""  The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and compensation for legal fees, as well as certification for class-action status.  The lawsuit was filed on behalf of the plaintiffs by the Florida-based Silver Law Group, which has been involved in lawsuits filed against the now-defunct exchange Cryptsy and digital currency startup Coinbase. Wites & Kapetan, another law firm based in Florida, is also involved in the suit.  Representatives for Kraken declined further comment when reached.

42400119,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAc22WG,1499290813,UK Cybercrime Watchdog: Surveillance Law Could Boost Digital Currency Use,"A controversial intelligence law passed by the UK last year could drive increased digital currency use, according to a new report.  The National Crime Agency (NCA), the UK law enforcement agency that focuses on organized crime and cybercrime, suggested in its 2017 strategic report that the tech could see more use among both criminals and the wider public after the Investigatory Powers Act 2016 – commonly known as the ""Snooper's Charter"" – became the law of the land last November. The report was published on June 28.  The law vastly expanded the surveillance powers of UK intelligence agencies, allowing them to collect more data from private companies, capture and dissect bulk communications, and hack into devices as part of investigations. It came into effect amid broad criticism from privacy advocates and journalists, though a UK rights group has since moved to challenge the law in the UK High Court.  Yet the NCA report – which notes that use of digital currencies ""amongst both criminals and the public will continue to increase"" – believes the Snooper's Charter may drive more people to leverage the tech, which while not anonymous affords greater privacy while transacting due to its pseudonymous and borderless nature.  The report's authors go on to state:  ""This trend will be driven by easier, potentially ubiquitous, access and potentially as a response to the introduction of legislation such as the Investigatory Powers Act 2016 and Digital Economy Bill 2016-17.""  The report itself doesn't call for any specific remedies to this perceived issue; rather, the authors ultimately write that ""the widespread use of these technologies will continue to present a particular challenge"".

42400105,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAc22MQ,1499283653,Former Dogecoin Exchange CEO Faces Fraud Charges,"UK police have brought fraud and money laundering charges against Ryan Kennedy, the founder the now-defunct dogecoin exchange service Moolah.  Kennedy, who created Moolah under the name Alex Green, appeared in court today, according to a statement from the Avon and Somerset Constabulary. Though the exact charges weren't identified, police said the associated crimes took place during 2014.  The new charges, quietly announced on 29th June, follow a three-year investigation investigation by authorities in the UK, coming more than two years after he was initially arrested (and later released) by police.  Local authorities said in a statement:  ""[Kennedy] has been charged with a number of offences under the Fraud Act 2006 and Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. It is alleged the offences were committed between January – December in 2014. This included the theft of bitcoins to a value in excess of £1 million, that were then spent on a luxury lifestyle.""  It was through Moolah, an early platform for buying and selling the meme-themed cryptocurrency, that Kennedy gained notoriety by sponsoring a NASCAR driver and later soliciting investments from community members through the distribution of a token.  Kennedy later purchased the digital currency exchange MintPal, which collapsed in late 2014 following a site relaunch and growing allegations of fraud that were levied against Kennedy. It was at that time that he first acknowledged that Alex Green wasn’t his real name.  He was ultimately taken to court by a group of developers who had launched their cryptocurrency through MintPal and accused him of stealing thousands of dollars in committed funds.  Kennedy is currently serving an 11-year prison sentence after being convicted last year on rape charges in the UK. He was arrested in relation to those crimes in early 2016, according to reports at the time.

42400129,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAc22e8,1499272232,"Goldman Sachs Eyes Bitcoin Price Near $4,000 in Latest Analysis","Bitcoin markets could rise as high as $3,900 in the future, according to a recent client note from investment bank Goldman Sachs.  The note from the bank's chief technician, Sheba Jafari, published by financial news site Zero Hedge, argues that bitcoin ""could consolidate sideways for a while longer"", highlighting a possible low of $1,857 and ""eventually targeting"" a figure of $3,212.  The analysis from Goldman comes weeks after Jafari published a more bearish analysis of the digital currency's prospects. It was around that time when bitcoin markets briefly surpassed the $3,000 mark. According to the CoinDeskBitcoin Price Index, prices reached an all-time high of $3,018.55 on 11th June. At press time, markets are currently trading around $2,595.  In the note, Jafari posits that bitcoin markets are in the fourth ""wave"" of a sequence that dates back to late 2010. As for what comes next, Jafari acknowledges that fourth waves ""tend to be messy/complex"".  Jafari goes on to write:  ""This means that it could remain sideways/overlapping for a little while longer. At this point, it’s important to look for either an ABC pattern or a more triangular ABCDE. The former would target somewhere close to 1,856; providing a much cleaner setup from which to consider getting back into the uptrend. The latter would hold within a 2,076/3,000 range for an extended period of time.”  “Either way, eventually expecting one more leg higher; a 5th wave. From current levels, [bitcoin] has a minimum target that goes out to 3,212 (if equal to the length of wave I),"" Jafari wrote. ""There’s potential to extend as far as 3,915 (if 1.618 times the length of wave I). It just might take time to get there.""

The bank said yesterday in a release that it is working with the Fraunhofer Institute for Material Flow and Logistics (IMI), a consultancy firm with operations in Germany, Spain and China.  The focus of that partnership, according to the 4th July announcement, is the pursuit of ""new processes and provides latest insights into the future of physical supply chains as well as the future deployment of blockchain based technology in this area"".  Dr. Bernd Laber, the bank's group executive for corporate trade finance and cash management, said in a statement:  ""We are working on several projects and in a number of consortiums also with other international banks on the digitisation of bank products and bank services, and on applications for blockchain technologies. As a corporate bank the focus on future supply chains of our customers is of paramount importance and we will develop this in co-operation with Fraunhofer Institute.""        Commerzbank, which has explored the tech through industry initiatives like the R3 distributed ledger consortium, will ""develop scenarios for future supply chains"" alongside IMI, though the research schedule and timeline isn't exactly clear.  The bank previously took part in a blockchain trial focused on commercial debt. That R3-led project also involved fellow banks ABN Amro, ING and KBC. Commerzbank first joined the R3 effort in the fall of 2015.

42400116,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAc22TJ,1499263237,South Korean Bitcoin Exchange to Pay Back Users After Account Thefts,"South Korea's largest bitcoin and ether exchange is moving to compensate users days after it emerged that the site's data systems had been compromised.  A report from regional news service Yonhap on Monday indicated that as many as 30,000 customers of Bithumb were impacted. The source of the data leak is believed to have been an employee's computer, leading to the draining of funds from an unknown number of user accounts.  According to data from CoinMarketCap, Bithumb is currently the fourth-largest bitcoin exchange by volume, accounting for roughly 3% of the global market. The exchange is the largest ethereum exchange as of today, reporting about 13.5% of total trade activity.  Though the exact scale of losses isn't known at press time, Bithumb said in a blog post published earlier today that it is providing 100,000 Korean won – worth about $86.50 at press time – to each affected customer.  Local  reports further indicate that the incident dates back to February, and was first reported to authorities late last month. One local user claimed to have 10 million won, worth roughly $8,700, taken from their account.  The exchange said that it will further compensate users whose funds are stolen as a result of the data leak.  ""In addition, for the members who suffer additional damage due to this incident, we will compensate the entire amount of damages in a responsible manner,"" Bithumb's operators said.  The incident has been reported to local authorities, according to Yonhap, resulting in the early stages of an investigation by the Korea Internet and Security Agency. An unnamed official told the publication that the the Korea Communications Commission is also involved in the investigation.

42400112,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAc22RL,1499256003,BNP-Backed Blockchain Crowdfunding Effort Completes Initial Stage,"A blockchain crowdfunding effort led by a subsidiary of French banking conglomerate BNP Paribas has completed the first phase of its development, according to the firm.  In a statement today, BNP Paribas Securities Services revealed that the blockchain platform, which enables private companies to issue securities, has reached the new milestone. Further, it said shares representing ownership in one bank client, as well as four startup firms that recently raised equity crowdfunding via the services of its partner in the project, SmartAngels, have been registered on the platform.  ""The platform can be used to register transactions on the primary and secondary markets and is being designed to meet the needs of a wide client base, including issuers, shareholders, investors (business angels, venture and growth capital investors) and crowdfunding platforms, as well as lawyers, notaries, accountants and banks,"" the release read.  No details on the technology used in the implementation were provided.  Overall, the news comes more than a year after the project was unveiled. At the time, BNP and SmartAngels were optimistic that the platform would be launched in the second half of 2016, though no details were provided as to why the milestone was delayed past initial projections.  The announcement further comes at a time when blockchain applications for crowdfunding, particularly in the nascent market for initial coin offerings or ICOs, is exploding, outpacing even traditional venture capital funding in the sector.  Going forward, the partners said they will be working to prepare the platform for larger-scale testing and commercialization.

42400126,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAc22bB,1499252404,What Monopoly? Blockchain Startup Setl Sets Sights Beyond Australia,"Setl founder Peter Randall isn't waiting for permission to build the first competing platform in an Australian post-trade system long dominated by a monopoly.  While the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) enjoys exclusive rights to clear and settle transactions for the nation's financial institutions, Randall's startup has already built a service he believes can process the load more quickly and at lower cost than ASX's proprietary CHESS platform.  Ironically, ASX's exploration of distributed ledger tech with partner Digital Asset Holdings has boosted the blockchain industry in Australia, yet its monopoly means less competition in bringing solutions to market.  Nevertheless, Randall isn't waiting for the nation's regulators to begin loosening older, monopolistic clearing and settlement controls.  And, even as a deadline approaches for a decision that could open up the Australian market to competition from his firm, Randall said he's working on multiple other projects on four different continents.  ""The most powerful force in the world is an idea whose time has come,"" he said, arguing that more progressive nations around the world will inevitably allow blockchain competition to flourish.  He told CoinDesk:  ""And it seems to me that it doesn’t really matter where or in which jurisdiction, or in what sort of process the onward march of the distributed ledger occurs.""  Familiar territory  Supporting Randall's optimistic view is that this isn't the first time he has found himself at the helm of a startup waiting for Australian financial regulators to pave the way for his ideas.  Long before he founded Setl, Randall helped build Chi-X, an international exchange established in 2005 under very similar regulatory conditions. It wasn't until six years after the exchange launched that regulators ended another ASX monopoly – that time, it was for the selling of stocks – clearing the way for his startup to compete.  So successful was that venture that, by the time he left the firm in 2009, it was transacting 9.1% of the trades in 10 European markets. To this day, Chi-X Australia records on average about $1bn of daily trading volume in the nation, gathering a total market share of 20%, according to the company's website.  In 2011, the same year Australia ended the ASX monopoly, Bats Global Markets purchased Chi-X's Europe arm in a deal then valued at $360m.  But even as Chi-X has grown to sell an increasing percentage of Australia’s total stocks, regulators have demanded that it rely on ASX technology to clear and settle those very same trades.  As a result of ASX's monopoly on the actual post-trade processes in Australia, attempts to disrupt that space have been largely restricted to the one company publicly doing business with Digital Asset Holdings.  Take two  Now that Randall has successfully pushed into one aspect of ASX's previous monopoly, he's using his latest startup to up-end the last vestiges of those old regulatory controls.  Founded in 2015, London-based Setl has reportedly raised as much as $45m in venture capital to help its battle for a market share of Australia’s post-trade revenues. That's compared to New York-based Digital Asset Holdings, which has raised $67m to work with ASX and others.  Like Digital Asset, Setl is not an open-source platform. During a recent demo of the technology, test blocks were settling about once every 0.83 seconds, though the average is about every five seconds, according to Randall. The system can process about 34 million transactions per day.  Last year, Randall's company launched its OpenCSD platform to move the increasingly disrupted services of central securities depositories to a blockchain. Then, four months later the company partnered with venture-based Cobalt DL to deploy that platform.  And, earlier this month, German marketplace organizer Deutsche Börse Group told CoinDesk it was in the early stages of experimenting with Setl's technology.  Among other customers that had to remain unnamed due to non-disclosure agreements are initiatives focused on financial infrastructure, private corporations and the public sector, according to Randall.  ""There's a spectrum of offers as there is indeed a spectrum of opportunities,"" he said.  In the regulator's court  Before Randall can fully enter the Australian market, though, the country's Council of Financial Regulators is expected to review the impact of opening up post-trade to competitors, according to an AFR report.  When that concludes, most likely in September, it will be up to the federal government to end ASX's post-trade monopoly, effectively opening the door to blockchain competitors in the space.  At around that same time, ASX is expected to come to a conclusion on whether it will fully replace its CHESS platform with the Digital Asset alternative.  In the end, Randall concedes that ""it’s important that Australia resolves, from Australia’s point of view, what Australia needs,"" even if that means the nation might concede what he perceives is a global leadership position.  ""It’s great to have a flagship [country],"" said Randall. “But you know what, let’s just get on with it.""  He concluded:  ""It’s getting on with it that’s more important than that there’s a flagship. I’m keen for that, but I’m not going to lose sleep if it doesn’t happen.""

42400127,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAc22cA,1499245205,The World Economic Forum Might Not Be Ready to Lead a Blockchain Revolution,"The research phase of the World Economic Forum's work with blockchain has only just begun, and already its managing director is beginning to explore a more hands-on approach.  So far, the international non-profit comprised of the leaders of more than a thousand of the largest companies in the world, has focused largely on establishing a blockchain working group, last week publishing its first in-depth white paper on how to maximize the impact of the technology.  But following publication of the paper, WEF managing director Richard Samans acknowledged how much more many of his members still have to learn, in spite of projects being initiated on several other fronts.  Samans told CoinDesk:  ""Most of this leader-level community is not very well versed in blockchain. In fact, they may know the term, but they don't know much about where the technology is right now and how it may be applied in multi-faceted ways throughout society.""  Ostensibly, the white paper – written by Blockchain Research Institute co-founders, Don and Alex Tapscott – was designed to lay the framework for how existing consortia, private companies and governments could work together to maximize the potential benefits of a shared, trustworthy ledger of transactions.  Still, Samans said that even some of the most senior-level executives among the WEF membership still need to learn more about how such a technology could be employed in ways that benefit society at large.  ""There’s a second potential benefit of issuing this white paper, for this particular community,"" said Samans. ""And that is to raise awareness of blockchain as as reality already, and to give advanced notice that this deserves some real thinking among all sorts of social actors.""  Blockchain match  Key to that learning curve are two main groups within the World Economic Forum.  First is the newly launched Global Future Council on the Future of Blockchain, with membership including Hyperledger executive director Brian Behlendorf, R3 chief technology officer Richard Gendal Brown and Everledger CEO Leanne Kemp.  Second is the Center for the Fourth Industrial Revolution, launched last October to pursue new ways to leverage the mutli-stakeholder approach across industries. With partners that include Salesforce, Kaiser Permanente, Palantir Technologies and SAP, the center has been studying new ways to implement AI, the civilian use of drones, distributed ledger technology and more.  According to Samans, blockchain itself is perfectly suited for the multi-stakeholder principals being followed within the center, which he said ""could improve the prospects for the technology's development.""  Whether that actually ever happens, though, is contingent on how quickly the members can catch up on the technology, and whether blockchain developers even want such centralizing oversight, regardless of its intentions.  Samans concluded:  ""We are also a fertile platform for further catalyzing partnerships and in this case, there are a number of potentially quite interesting use cases of blockchain, which are really in the early stages of being explored, whether they have to do with development or the way the economy operates.""
