6598512,https://newsbtc.com/?p=514020,1672268455,Bitcoin Could See Another Bull Rally If This Happens,"Bitcoin is still strangling at the $16,000 price level with no significant movement up or down. This is normal given the historically low rates of volatility that are being recorded in the market. However, there may be some good rallies in the near future for the digital asset, but it depends on what BTC whales do. Bitcoin Whales Not Interested A look at bitcoin whale transactions over the month of December shows that whale interest in the digital asset has been on the decline. This coincides with the low price ranges of BTC during this time, and with such little movement, it becomes harder to flip a profit. Related Reading: Why The Bitcoin Mining Hashrate May Not Be Out Of The Woods Just Yet These whale transactions carrying $1 million and above have seen a decline in recent times. This shows a lack of interest in both buying and selling from these large investors. As a result, the price of bitcoin has continued to stagnate between $16,600 and $16,800. In essence, this lack of activity from the large BTC whales is neither bullish nor bearish. The next trend, however, will be decided from what these large holders decide to do from here. BTC whale interest declines in crypto winter | Source: Santiment As this Santiment chart shows, a decline in whale interest has usually coincided with periods of low prices. However, if there were to be some significant accumulation from these large holders, then the price of bitcoin will begin another bull rally. Since whale transactions carrying at least $1 million are sitting at a 2-year low, it makes for a prime setup for at least a short-term rally. If the whales increase their BTC holdings during this time, the impact on the price of BTC will become apparent right away. How High Can BTC Go? Santiment notes that an accumulation trend from these large whales would trigger a historically bullish signal for the digital asset. This means that such events have always led to an upward rally in the past. When this happened in August 2021, it triggered the rally that saw bitcoin hit its all-time high price of $69,000. BTC price falls below $16,700 | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com This time around, with the BTC price sitting so low, such a trend would lead to at least a 10% increase in the price of the digital asset. From here, a 10% increase would mean that bitcoin would surpass the $20,000 level once more, although a lot of resistance from the bears would be expected at such levels. Related Reading: Terra Classic (LUNC) Beats The Odds With 16% Rally, More Gains Ahead However, on the flip side, a continued decline will increase selling pressure on BTC from here. That would mean a reversal toward the $15,000 level once more. Now, it becomes a waiting game to see what happens first. BTC’s price was sitting at $16,684 at the time of this writing.

In the same time frame, SHIB depreciated by 3%. In the past week, the meme coin also did not register gains, losing a few support lines after losing close to 6% of its market value. SHIB has now formed a pattern that indicates that the coin might witness a breakout to the upside in the coming 24 hours. The technical outlook still displays bearish signs on the daily chart. Sellers have remained in control of the price for most of this month. Buyers still have to come to the rescue for SHIB to follow through with an upside breakout. According to the technicals, the coin might fall on its chart over the immediate trading sessions and then move to the upside. The trading volume of SHIB declined, which supports the notion that buyers have remained low in the market. At the moment, SHIB is trading 90% below its all-time high, which the coin secured almost one year ago. Related Reading: Uniswap Tops Other Big Crypto In Social Dominance Despite Price Drop Shiba Inu Price Analysis: One-Day Chart SHIB was exchanging hands at $0.0000080 at the time of writing. Over the past week, the Shiba Inu price fell from the $0.0000082 support line. Shiba Inu is expected to fall below the $0.0000080 level as buying strength remains low. It has formed a symmetrical triangle pattern which re-affirms that the coin could witness a rally due to a breakout. The first local support stood at $0.0000076, after which the meme coin is expected to break out. The breakout will cause the Shiba Inu price to rally to $0.00000824, and clearing that resistance will take the coin to $0.0000086. The amount of Shiba Inu traded in the last session declined, which explains why buyers remained low. Technical Analysis SHIB was in the sellers’ dominance zone for November and December. The Relative Strength Index was below the 40 mark after the recent fall in price. The indicator’s reading displayed that sellers exceeded buyers at press time, indicating bearishness. On the same note, due to a lack of demand, SHIB traveled below the 20-Simple Moving Average line (SMA), which meant that sellers were driving the price momentum in the market. If SHIB remains above the $0.0000080 mark, the meme coin will move above the 20-SMA. Other technical indicators have also sided with the possibility of SHIB’s value dropping on its chart. The Parabolic SAR demonstrates the price direction and the trend of the asset. The indicator was above the price candlesticks, which indicates that the price is in a continued downtrend. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) presents price momentum and trend reversals. MACD continued to paint red histograms, which meant that this was an indication for traders to sell, as that would mean that the price of SHIB could increase.

42388302,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRDWgd,1672257197,Anonymous Twitter User Leaks 3Commas API Database,"An anonymous Twitter user has obtained around 100,000 API keys belonging to users of the crypto trading service 3Commas. The leaker published more than 10,000 of the keys on Wednesday and says the rest “will be published full [sic] randomly in the upcoming days.”  3Commas CEO Yuriy Sorokin confirmed the authenticity of the leak in a tweet on Wednesday, adding that ""as an immediate action, we have asked that Binance, KuCoin, and other supported exchanges revoke all the [API] keys that were connected to 3Commas.""  The leak comes after dozens of users of 3Commas claimed that their API keys were used to execute trades on exchanges such as Binance, KuCoin and Coinbase without their consent. As CoinDesk previously reported, 3Commas confirmed that users lost at least $6 million to attackers starting in October, but that sum has at least doubled in recent weeks according to users who spoke to CoinDesk.  CoinDesk isn't linking to or naming the pseudonymous leaker's Twitter account because doing so could further expose sensitive private information.  3Commas initially told CoinDesk its users' losses resulted from phishing attacks, but those users – more than 50 of whom have organized themselves into Telegram chat groups – have insisted that their credentials must have been leaked by 3Commas or an exchange like Binance or Coinbase.  Read more: Alameda-Backed Crypto Trading Firm 3Commas Says It’s Pretty Sure It Wasn’t Breached  Wednesday's data dump is the clearest evidence yet that the credentials were leaked rather than phished. Multiple 3Commas users confirmed to CoinDesk that they were able to find their API keys among those that were shared by the leaker.  In his tweet, 3Commas' Sorokin noted that he and his company ""did everything that we could to investigate an inside job, as it was always a possible scenario and on our watch list, but proof of an inside job was not found.""  Before 3Commas made its statement, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao cautioned users on Wednesday afternoon that ""if you have ever put an API key in 3Commas (from any exchange), please disable it immediately.""  3Commas allows users to set up trading bots that automatically execute trades on their behalf on third-party crypto exchanges. Those exchanges generate API keys, and users plug those keys into 3Commas in order to grant the app access to their accounts. The API keys included in this week’s leak were, according to the leaker, generated on Binance and KuCoin.  UPDATE (Dec. 28, 2020 20:13 UTC): Adds tweet from Binance CEO.

Total Amount Held By 1k-10k BTC Value Band Has Sharply Gone Down Recently As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the latest drawdown in the holdings of the 1k-10k BTC value band is the most drastic in the history of the crypto. The relevant indicator here is the “UTXO Value Bands,” which tells us the total amount of coins each value band is holding in the market. UTXOs are divided into these “value bands” or groups based on their current value. For instance, the 100-1k BTC value band includes all UTXOs carrying between 100 and 1,000 coins. Here, the relevant UTXO value band is the 1k-10k BTC range, a historically important cohort as usually only the whales have wallets with UTXO amounts so large. Now, the below chart displays the trend in the total holdings of this value band over the last five years: Looks like the value of the metric has rapidly declined in recent months | Source: CryptoQuant The graph shows that the total number of coins held by this Bitcoin UTXO value band has seen a sharp drop this year. In all, the drawdown has amounted to 453,205.04 BTC being dumped by this cohort since the peak observed in June 2022. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miner Selling Power Plunges, Green Signal For Price? For comparison, in the 2018/19 bear market, the 1k-10k BTC value band saw a total drawdown of 324,868.65 BTC from the high. During the COVID black swan crash of 2020, the group also distributed a significant amount, shedding 186,928.48 from its holdings. And in the bull run during the first half of last year, these whales reduced their holdings by 407,457.14 BTC between the peak in February and the July bottom. The latest drawdown in the metric’s value is the sharpest that Bitcoin has seen yet. Because of this fact, the quant exclaims the current cycle to be the “most challenging” one in the history of the asset so far. Related Reading: Analyst Explains Why Ethereum Is Bullish Against Bitcoin An interesting pattern can also be seen in the chart; whenever the 1k-10k BTC has finished with the distribution and started accumulating again, Bitcoin has felt a bullish impact. “Generally, the market can only recover when this cohort has enough confidence to accumulate again,” explains the analyst. “And at the moment, we still not get any positive signals from this cohort.” BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s price floats around $16,600, down 1% in the last week.

Greco said that “there is potential in the next few years” for a digital dollar in the U.S., but that the Federal Reserve is waiting for Congress to enact legislation before it can move forward. He doesn't expect Congress to pass such a law next year but said he expects the ""the conversation to advance on Capitol Hill, especially in regards to privacy"" in 2023.  Read more: Big Banks, NY Fed Start to Test Digital Tokens for 'Wholesale' Transactions  On the same program, Josh Lipsky, senior director of the Atlantic Council’s GeoEconomic Center, said that CBDCs have made “huge leaps” in other parts of the world, such as South Korea and Europe.  He said next year the European Central Bank may move forward to the pilot phase of a digital euro from a development phase, which would be a major step given the size of the European Union. He said U.S. authorities will be looking to see how the ECB tackles privacy concerns of a digital currency and how it would interact with the banking system.  He also sees the potential of a wholesale CDBC, which would be used in transactions between banks, as opposed to a retail CBDC, which would be used by consumers in everyday transactions like buying a cup of coffee.  Lipsky said that in light implosion of crypto exchange FTX, the issues that some crypto exchanges face “do not extend to central bank digital currencies.”  CORRECTION: A previous version of this article incorrectly identified Michael Greco as a lobbyist.

42411689,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfFIy,1672252851,7 Platforms and Communities Web3 Writers Should Know,"Most people associate non-fungible tokens (NFTs) with digital art and collectibles, but a growing number of writers and poets are also carving out a space for literary NFTs on the blockchain.  It’s fitting, really: Writers were the ones who conceptualized what the metaverse could look like in the early 20th century. The first descriptions of virtual reality in literature are often attributed to the science fiction writer Stanley G. Weinbaum, who wrote the 1935 short story, ""Pygmalion's Spectacles."" The term “metaverse” was first coined by author Neal Stephenson in his 1992 novel ""Snow Crash"" (he’s now working on his own metaverse-first blockchain, Lamina1), and Ernest Cline pushed the concept forward in his book ""Ready Player One.""  It is writers who create new realities – first with their ideas and then through precise articulation. Today, the blockchain serves as an advanced publishing medium that has inspired emerging authors and poets to connect with niche audiences of internet collectors and futurists.  Unlike in traditional publishing, the author is involved in every step of the Web3 publishing process, from production to mint. This allows the writer to set his own prices, embed royalty structures and combine his words with digital imagery. The result is often an immersive, interactive piece of work that cultivates community and connections far beyond what has traditionally been available to writers and publishers.  If you are interested in getting started with literary NFTs, several pathways already exist thanks to the enterprising and experimental writers who have made waves over the past year. Here are several platforms and communities – including a few decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) – that are experimenting with writing on the blockchain.  Mirror  One of the first Web3 publishing platforms writers often hear about is Mirror. Similar to a decentralized version of blogging platform Medium, Mirror lets anyone with an Ethereum wallet (via MetaMask, Rainbow or Coinbase Wallet) create an account and start publishing their thoughts. Authors can also turn their posts into collectibles, meaning readers will be able to buy them as NFTs. Companies and organizations can also create Mirror pages and assign multiple contributors.  Adam Levy, Web3 creator and host of ""Mint,"" a podcast documenting the creator economy, uses Mirror as an alternative newsletter platform in combination with Substack, a popular Web2 subscription tool.  According to Levy, the benefit of using Mirror is that it signifies a certain amount of authority for thought leaders who want to discuss crypto and Web3: “When you post on Mirror, it gives a signal that you're already crypto native and you automatically get an audience in that community,” he told CoinDesk.  In addition, Levy uses Bello, a no-code blockchain analytics tool, to ""token-gate"" some of his Mirror content and link the wallet addresses of his readers to their email addresses. This allows him to cross-reference his Substack readers with his Mirror readers and discover more about their Web3 identities from the NFTs in their wallets. (He explains in detail how this process works in a recent Mirror post.)  Kendall Warson, co-founder of the NFT art discovery platform Cohart, appreciates Mirror because of its smooth user experience. “The general design is really strong,” Warson said. “You can add a lot of visuals, and it feels very intuitive.”  Warson also added that Twitter users – who are typically more Web3 native than users of other major social platforms – are getting used to seeing and re-sharing Mirror posts. This encourages readers to collect the content as NFTs and take pride in “owning” pieces of widely circulated content.  “It just feels friendly to those networks,” she said. “Getting information to community members so that we can maintain touch points with them and drive them towards community ownership is really powerful. And I don't think that that exists on a lot of other thought leadership platforms.”  Some thought leaders are even experimenting with Mirror for academic purposes. Privacy researcher Anastasia Uglova chose to publish her graduate thesis on Mirror so that readers could easily engage with it, unlike most academic papers siloed away in traditionally paywalled databases like JSTOR.  Soltype  If you are an author with an idea for a full-length e-book, you will want to consider a platform that enables long-form Web3 publishing. Soltype is a new company with a mission to do just that. The Solana blockchain-based platform is experimenting with book drops by well-known authors, and it has released its first title, ""Riglan,"" by Marvel writer B. Earl.  “There will be 1,001 copies of the same book,” said co-founder Juan Briceno. The cover art will vary in rarity, aimed at creating more demand for the collectibles. The books will also be ""NFT-gated,"" meaning only collectors holding the corresponding NFT in their crypto wallets will be able to access the text.  Soltype also provides a secondary marketplace where readers may resell the book: “Once you sell that book, you are no longer able to read it anymore, but the new buyer will,” Briceno explained.  According to Briceno, the Soltype team is also observing the traditional publishing industry to find potential opportunities to one day bring blockchain to the mainstream.  Alexandria Labs  Similar to the Solana blockchain-based Soltype is Alexandria, an Ethereum and Optimism-based rare book publishing platform. Notably, Alexandria stores books on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), a decentralized cloud storage network that helps ensure an author’s book can never be banned, censored or de-platformed.  Authors can choose to token-gate their book or make it viewable to the public. Both options are viewable on Alexandria’s e-reader.  “Different authors have different goals,” Alexandria Labs co-founder Amelie Lasker told CoinDesk. “Some authors just want anyone to read a book … and make it totally open-source, free to read and people can collect it. But other authors really want to protect their intellectual property. That's why our e-reader allows [authors] to decrypt and encrypt.”  Because Alexandria specializes in preserving the rarity of digital books, all first editions of Alexandria books have a maximum of 100 copies, but authors can release as many subsequent editions as they would like.  Alexandria released its two first books: Rahul Rana’s deep tech playbook, ""Making Moonshots"" and Ana María Caballero’s short story collection, ""Tryst."" The company is working on a self-publishing tool for interested authors and taking on selective partnerships with writers who have a project in the works (you can fill out a form to be considered for the beta list).  theVERSEverse  Beyond publishing platforms, Web3 needs galleries, community and curation for literary creations. The poetry NFT gallery, theVERSEverse, addresses these needs and more by enlisting new poets and gathering poem NFTs from across blockchains and platforms into its reading room.  Co-founded by Sasha Stiles, Caballero and Kalen Iwamoto, theVERSEverse hosts regular Twitter Spaces and shows at both digital and IRL (in real life) showrooms worldwide and the metaverse.  PageDAO  What if there could be a currency specifically for books? The writer-founded decentralized autonomous organization, PageDAO, was founded with that very premise in mind. The governance and utility token, PAGE, allows authors and writing communities to create unique markets around their NFTBooks using DeFi (decentralized-finance) principles. Owning PAGE tokens grants members governance, access to perks and the ability to buy curated content. Member writers are also experimenting with NFT books on OpenSea and PageDAO’s own Readme Books NFTBook Minter.  StoryDAO  Everyone loves a good fan fiction spinoff, and StoryDAO takes the idea of community world building to a new level. Membership is granted by minting a producer token. Once you’re in, you congregate with other storytellers to collectively govern a shared treasury that funds the community’s expansion of a particular story universe.  While things are still experimental, StoryDAO is mobilizing new members with fun, interactive storytelling experiences. At NFT.NYC in June 2022, the community led a collaborative Story Quest adventure, which guided participants via text message through an interactive storytelling experience.  The ultimate goal of StoryDAO is to use Web3 technology to change the way intellectual property is created and owned and bridge the gap between Hollywood and the metaverse.  Paragraph  Newsletters can serve an important purpose in an author’s career, letting them build a loyal audience and speak directly to a fanbase of engaged readers. Paragraph is a newsletter tool for Web3, where readers can subscribe via their crypto wallets or email addresses and authors can issue airdrops to provide an incentive for reader engagement. Authors can also send token-gated newsletters that require NFT purchases to access.  The platform is highly customizable and even allows writers to build out ​​decentralized contributor teams and split earnings among all writers.  The growing popularity of literary NFTs  Thanks to the effort of blockchain-based authors, increasingly prominent buyers are beginning to vouch for literary NFTs as valuable collectibles. According to Soltype, as of December 2022, at least $25 million worth of literary NFTs had been traded since November 2021. While data on literary NFTs is still limited, first movers are enthusiastic.

42421404,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXo3S9,1672249516,Why Solana Was Decimated by Bankman-Fried’s Downfall,"Debate has accelerated in recent days over the future prospects of Solana, a layer 1 smart-contract blockchain that in some respects competes with Ethereum. The chain grew rapidly and saw immense hype during the 2020-2021 bull market, particularly from venture capitalists. But the recent departure of major projects to other chains and a massive drop in total value on the Solana chain have raised questions about its future prospects.  Lingering technological challenges are a common worry cited by doubters. Competition from Ethereum layer 2s represent a growing threat to Solana’s core premise of faster and lower-cost transactions. But the biggest cloud shading Solana’s sunshine is the fall of Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of the FTX exchange and hedge fund Alameda Research.  David Z. Morris is CoinDesk's chief insights columnist.  Bankman-Fried was perhaps the single most prominent backer of Solana, and skeptics could reasonably argue that the price appreciation of the SOL token and related assets from 2020-2021 was driven at least in part by Bankman-Fried’s market interventions and advocacy.  The consequences of growing Solana skepticism have been dire, based purely on numbers. From a peak price of $258.78 on Nov. 6, 2021, Solana’s SOL token has declined to just over $10. That’s a drop of 96%, vastly sharper than the drawdown from peak for BTC (-74.5%) and ETH (-74.6%). It’s even a sharper drop, incredibly, than dogecoin (DOGE) has seen in the bear market – the meme coin is down a mere 76% from its October 2021 local high, though it's 87% down from its May 2021 all-time high.  From its position as the fifth-most valuable crypto token in early November, Solana’s SOL token has dropped to 19th place, according to data from CoinGecko.  See also: Solana DeFi Project Mercurial to Relaunch, Replace Token  The total value of tokens staked in decentralized-finance (DeFi) protocols on Solana has declined even more dramatically, from nearly $10.2 billion on Nov. 9, 2021 to under $210 million at press time – a decline of nearly 98%. Solana is now only the 12th-largest DeFi chain by total value locked or TVL, trailing not only Ethereum layer 2s like Polygon and Optimism, but also far more obscure projects like Cronos and DefiChain.  'Samcoins'  The single sharpest percentage drop in Solana’s metrics came in early November following the collapse of FTX, and mounting evidence of massive fraud by Sam Bankman-Fried. It now seems increasingly likely that some of Bankman-Fried’s extensive support for the chain was funded via FTX’s wholesale theft of customer funds.  Former Alameda executives including CEO Caroline Ellison, moreover, have claimed in recent statements to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that Bankman-Fried encouraged market manipulation of FTX’s FTT token. Given that, it seems improbable that Bankman-Fried wasn't also manipulating the price of Solana-based projects he helped launch, controlled large stakes in and used in the accounting and loan fraud that formed the core of the FTX swindle.  Those related projects, including the Serum decentralized exchange and the self-described DeFi brokerage Oxygen, are sometimes derisively referred to as “Samcoins.” They have seen catastrophic declines in their own token prices, and Serum was rendered “defunct” by the collapse of FTX, necessitating a community fork.  Market manipulation via Alameda would have effectively been funded by the clandestine redirection of FTX customer funds from other assets, such as bitcoin and ether, toward the trading of SOL or other ecosystem tokens. Alameda’s market-making and trading activities as a whole appear in retrospect to have been wildly unprofitable. Some critics have argued that their SOL activity would have amounted to propping up the value of Solana, while artificially holding down the price of blue chips like ETH and BTC.  This chaos has led to hints of something like a death spiral as developers and projects depart the struggling chain. Most dramatically, the DeGods and Y00ts NFT (non-fungible token) projects were confirmed to be leaving Solana for Ethereum and Polygon, respectively. In November, stablecoin issuer Tether swapped $1 billion of USDT from Solana to Ethereum.  Lingering issues  All this comes on top of worries that predated the collapse of FTX. Solana has experienced repeated chain halts since its inception, often caused by “botting” or other forms of spam overwhelming the network. This is inextricably linked to Solana’s core value proposition as a faster, cheaper layer 1 than Ethereum: For a blockchain, lower transaction costs and higher speed often come as a trade-off for security and stability.  See also: Is Solana Leading Crypto Into Retail or Trailing Apple? | Opinion  Moreover, that value proposition may itself be less compelling than it was when Solana launched in March 2020. The years since have seen significant growth in “layer 2” products on Ethereum that offer faster and less expensive transactions, but gain the benefit of Ethereum’s security, mostly through the use of “rollup” technology. Those new competitors include Optimism, a layer 2 that launched in December 2021 and now has more than twice as much value locked as Solana.  These are serious headwinds, and commentators across the crypto industry have been debating the chain’s prospects in recent days. In a best-case scenario, Solana’s remaining builders face a long road back to ecosystem health and relevance. The big question is whether there are enough of them, with enough conviction, to go the distance.",NEGATIVE,ETH | SOL,ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,David Z.

42417081,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcRpOk1,1672240555,The Next Wave of Institutional Digital Asset Adoption,"Skeptics are taking a cheap shot at framing the FTX debacle as the end of crypto’s mainstream appeal and adoption. Nothing could be further from the truth. If anything, the collapse of one of the largest centralized exchanges is a clear sign that in 2023 and beyond we will see more reliance on decentralized infrastructure and better regulation.  As many have pointed out, Sam Bankman-Fried's litany of alleged crimes and abuses was a failure in CeFi, not DeFi. A look at DeFiLlama shows that decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes are up by almost 70% despite negative market sentiment. A portion of the market is clearly doubling down on crypto’s decentralization ethos.  Sean Lee is the co-founder of Odsy Network and serves as the executive director of the Switzerland-based Odsy Foundation. This article is part of Crypto 2023.  But there’s also a way in which crypto’s influence will continue to grow in traditional finance despite the controversy. A 2022 survey by The Economist found that 85% of investors “agree there is a need for open-source digital currencies as a diversifier in a portfolio or treasury account.” However, that same survey found that a lack of regulation was the most cited barrier to digital asset adoption among institutional investors and corporate treasuries.  (Tellingly, “lack of regulation” was tied with “financial market structures” as a barrier, which will be discussed as well.)  In 2023, a side effect of the FTX and Alameda Research debacle will be a shift towards more traditional regulated entities as the entry points into digital asset markets. This will be especially true for users who still prefer to use more straightforward and familiar service providers over centralized finance (CeFi). Why go with middling services? Go fully DeFi or fully traditional.  Read more: 23 Blockchain Predictions for 2023 | Opinion  After the market recalibrates and regulations catch up, these are the firms that will be primed to meet the rising demand for digital assets among institutions, family offices and even many retail customers. It’s easier to imagine a family office going to a regulated and reputable firm like Fidelity for diversification into crypto rather than directly into Uniswap or some new CeFi contender that may or may not operate similarly to FTX.  Is TradFi prepared?  Now, the important question is: Are these firms ready for this? The truth is that there are some significant challenges they face at the moment. Although federally chartered banks in the U.S. have had a green light for crypto since 2020, most firms have shied away from offering digital asset products other than some exposure to BTC or ETH in limited capacities.  Custody and regulations  The first challenge they face comes from the responsibilities that are created by taking custody of digital assets. There are potential liabilities that firms have to take into consideration when offering crypto due to risk management policies and consumer protection laws.  There’s also added complexity in the fact that different regulations might have to be taken into account for different digital assets. While the global regulatory landscape continues to evolve, when a firm retains custody of an asset, some of these questions fall under its responsibility. For example, determining whether a particular asset is considered a security or a commodity, and how it may be treated differently in other jurisdictions, becomes relevant to how it needs to be managed by the firm.  See also: 5 Digital Economy Predictions for 2023 | Opinion  Infrastructure  Then there are a number of infrastructure problems that need to be solved before firms can expand their product offerings into digital asset markets effectively. At the root of them is the fact that crypto is an incredibly fragmented space with assets being managed in different blockchain networks, and has minimal crossover with current financial market structures (as found in the aforementioned survey by the Economist).  A firm looking to offer digital asset products has a hard time building products that can count on a consolidated view of the crypto space. They would have to set up and run dedicated systems for each blockchain network and all the different crypto or tokenized assets that run on them.  In fact, crypto on-ramp services often have entire teams dedicated to addressing the compliance and technical development issues of adding new assets to their offering. It’s easy to see how solving these complex problems on their own is not a priority for traditional finance firms despite the growing demand for digital assets.  All of these challenges point to a broader problem that can be summarized as follows: Crypto and Web3 infrastructure are evolving quickly, but developers still ignore rules-based access control as the main starting point.  Where they are now  Currently, traditional financial firms looking to offer digital assets have limited options in terms of implementing compliant custody and infrastructure. They rely on either siloed proprietary software or turnkey solutions that offer the same product to every other competitor and eliminate any competitive advantage firms might develop.  These approaches go against an overall transition towards open-source software infrastructure for institutions that pre-dates Web3 and offers known benefits in security, customizability and community-driven innovation with no vendor lock-in. Moreover, they leave little room for developing financial products that meet customer needs such as user experience, access rights, self-custody, risk controls or rule-based frameworks and guardrails for local regulations.  Where they should be  What would be a better option that allows these firms to meet customer needs? A decentralized and open-source access control layer for crypto and Web3.  This layer would take the form of a single network dedicated to dynamic decentralized wallets (dWallets) that are programmable, transferable and able to sign transactions across different blockchains. This new open-source-based infrastructure for wallets could take on the burden of custody and off-load much of the complexity in infrastructure-building for traditional firms.  Read more: 2023 Should Be the Year of On-Chain User Security | Opinion  As a result, financial services firms could just focus on expanding their digital asset offerings as they see fit in an almost plug-and-play manner. As long as their services are built on top of this layer, they can introduce crypto into existing financial products with ease and even develop their own digital asset products. All of this happens while custody stays with the customer and all the necessary rules for the product are mapped into existing risk and compliance policies set by the firms but enforced by the decentralized network.  Such a layer would enable firms to address customer needs by offering services such as:  Non-custodial products that are decoupled from potential associated liabilities and reduce regulatory burden  Easier expansion into new assets thanks to multi-chain compatibility  Consolidated views and portfolio curation across digital asset markets  Allow listed liquidity pools or licensed trading venues restrictions  Standardized rule-based products with risk controls, investment profiling, regulatory compliance and particular customer preferences for exclusion of certain assets (ESG considerations)  For their customers, digital assets would feel like an easily-digestible extension of the financial products they already know. It would simply be another component of products like pensions, insurance or savings accounts.  Rather than diverting resources in technical infrastructure implementation and integrations, firms could then continue to prioritize their roles in their relationships to customers as follow:  Financial advisory  Portfolio curation  Product construction  Auditing and reporting  Risk management  Compliance enforcement  Once you build decentralized access control, the decentralized world of Web3 and the traditional world of finance can finally be brought together, forever leaving behind the current divergence in user experience, expectation and regulatory compliance. This eliminates the space in the market for debacles like FTX.  This is digital assets done right. In 2023 we will see a move towards decentralized infrastructure and better regulation. But more importantly, we will see new solutions that bridge both trends.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Sean Lee,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/12/28/the-next-wave-of-institutional-digital-asset-adoption,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ea78d509dfd8206d83378b2bb928f3323ac0a22b-4800x2700.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42417077,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcRpOgv,1672238906,NFTs Are Securities and It’s Great,"Everyone in the non-fungible token (NFT) market is terrified that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will decide that NFTs are securities and regulate them. They should get over it. Of course NFTs are securities. That’s what makes them so powerful and promising.  Rather than avoid SEC regulation, the NFT industry should embrace this categorization. It’s inevitable and desirable, especially because once the SEC understands how the NFT market works, it’s likely to regulate with a light touch.  I hope that got your attention. Let me explain by way of analogy.  Brian Frye is a law professor at the University of Kentucky and conceptual artist who works with NFTs. This article is part of Crypto 2023.  The art market has always been a securities market, we just couldn’t see it, because objects got in the way. The art market is the market for ""art as an investment."" Most people think when you buy an artwork, you’re buying an object. Wrong. You’re really buying an entry on an artist’s catalogue raisonné, the list of all the artworks the art market attributes to that artist.  That ledger entry is usually accompanied by a physical token, typically a dirty canvas or lumpy lock. It doesn't matter what is represented, because only the ledger entry has valuable. You can tell this is true because if the connection between the ledger entry and the object is broken, the object is worthless, even though it hasn’t physically changed. In other words, the object just enables the sale of the ledger entry, like a bearer bond.  The NFT market works exactly the same way, it just eliminates the object and enables collectors to trade ledger entries directly, rather than by proxy. Obviously, that’s great, because it’s way cheaper and more efficient than trading fragile, costly objects. It used to be that collectors traded receipts for paintings stored in an Swiss art freehold. Now they can trade NFTs instead, what a relief.  But eliminating the art object forces us to wrestle with the nature of both the NFT and art markets. I refer to NFTs as “uncanny” tokens, because as Freud observed, they represent the return of the repressed, as the familiar becomes unfamiliar. Why do so many people find NFTs and the NFT market unsettling? Because they take art and the art market, which everyone thought they understood and make it look weird. Why would collectors spend $1 million on a digital receipt? The same reason they spend $1 million on a dirty canvas: they hope to sell it for more.  See also: The Art World Underestimates the Power of NFTs  So, what are you really buying when you buy an artwork or an NFT? A fractional interest in the commercial goodwill associated with an artist, or rather, a share of the artist’s “clout.” If the artist becomes an art star, then their clout will increase and you will be able to sell your artwork or NFT at a profit. But if their star fades, your artwork or NFT is worthless, just like any other failed investment.  We live in a clout economy  Is an investment in artwork or NFTs a security? Of course. The Supreme Court’s well-known Howey test states that an investment is a security the SEC can regulate if it is an investment of money in a common enterprise with the expectation of profit based on the efforts of others. Every investment in artwork or NFTs is an investment in an artist’s career, with the expectation (or at least hope) of profit, by virtue of the artist becoming famous. It couldn’t be more obvious that art and NFT collectors are buying a security interest in an artist’s career.  Light touch  O.K., so can the SEC regulate the art market and the NFT market? Of course it can. But it doesn’t want to, or at the very least it likely wouldn't regulate the asset class very heavily. Everyone says the key question is whether an investment “is” a security. But that’s stupid. The Howey test is hopelessly expansive – anything can be a security if you squint a little. The real question – the important question – is whether the SEC wants to regulate an investment.  The SEC very much doesn’t want to regulate the art market, and I suspect the SEC will soon figure out that it doesn’t want to regulate the NFT market either.  Why come? Well, because the SEC is in the business of regulating things it thinks “look like” securities. Historically, the SEC regulated the kinds of things it had always regulated (like stocks and bonds) and has avoided regulating new things even (if they'd fit the definition of a security). This is especially true when these things that would be new to the SEC have been around for a long time, like the art market.  Of course, the SEC has been making noises about regulating NFTs. I suspect it will soon regret most of what it has said and begin backpedaling, because the agency doesn’t have much to offer the NFT market. And if it starts regulating the NFT market, it’ll be hard put to explain why it isn’t regulating the art market as well.  My best guess is the SEC will leave well-enough alone, regulate a few tokens that look the most like stocks and then back off.  See also: The Different Types of NFTs: A Simple Guide  But wait. That’s where it gets cool. Because if the NFT market really is a securities market in clout, its potential is massive. We live in a clout economy, in which people value nothing more than fame. Celebrities are the vehicle through which people understand their own lives and the world around them. They generate massive amounts of social capital by making the world meaningful for consumers.  And yet, celebrities can only capture a tiny fraction of the social value they generate. Kim Kardashian may be a billionaire, but she is leaving many more billions on the table in social value she can’t claim.  NFTs could change all that by enabling celebrities to securitize their fame. What if Kim Kardashian could sell NFTs effectively representing a fractional interest in her clout? People who think she will be even more famous in the future could speculate on just how famous she will become and people who think she is a flash in the pan could short her clout.  The point is, it would give celebrities – even authors – access to the capital markets they’ve never had before. That could transform the market for knowledge goods, by enabling authors to sell investments in their project, rather than expensive copies.  We live in a world of digital abundance, as yet unrealized. Maybe NFTs can help us get to the promised land.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | WALLET,Brian Frye,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/12/28/nfts-are-securities-and-its-great,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f14b0e29ee004815cb42e58d9eeeb43484de5d94-3024x2142.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42417074,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcRpOdp,1672236658,How Web3 Helps People Take Control of Their Digital Identity,"As we enter 2023, it’s more clear than ever that the decentralized digital revolution isn’t going away. Businesses and individuals alike are starting to see the benefits of this nascent technology and Web3 services are on the rise.  However, with this change come new and growing concerns over security and access, as well as fundamental human-rights issues to consider. Realistically, if digital services are only going to become more and more common in regular life, making safe access to them is about more than just convenience – it’s essential.  Sandy Carter is senior vice president and channel chief of Unstoppable Domains. This article is part of Crypto 2023.  Fortunately, the industry is ready to address these issues in the form of sovereign digital identities that can act as both a gateway and shield for Web3 platforms. Best of all, this isn’t an idea for tomorrow – it’s a technology available to all today.  Securing your identity is only the beginning  Identity theft isn’t new, but it is a growing concern with every passing year. According to PwC's ""Global Economic Crime and Fraud Survey 2022,"" external threats from hackers and organized crime are rising, with 46% of respondents claiming they have suffered some form of fraud in the past 24 months. With the way things are going, this needs to change.  The big issue is how much control and security people have with their digital identities. Digital systems already play a big role in our lives. With Web3 looking to digitize our lives even further, the need to be in charge of who you are online has never been more important.  Read more: Hardliners Stymie Online Identity Innovation  Having such an ID comes with a whole host of benefits for interacting with Web3 services because it can act as a wallet address, a reputational tool and much more. It can covey your credentials across multiple computer platforms, enable encrypted email forwarding and even serve as a digital business card.  Digital identity – specifically solutions leveraging zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) – can also be used to attest to something without having to provide personally identifying information as proof. For crypto enthusiasts, it might be most exciting to hear it can complete know-your-customer (KYC) requirements without having to hand over sensitive documentation to third parties.  This isn’t just about Web3 access either. Anywhere you have an existing legacy identification system you have a system that could benefit from blockchain-powered, ZK-enabled, verifiable credentials. These systems ensure nobody except the owner can access their sensitive data and also give service providers the assurance they are dealing with real customers, not imposters.  Web3 digital identities stand to be both essential and revolutionary in the coming decade, and is already gaining traction in the market today. Fast and efficient blockchains already exist that can provide the speed and scaling capacity to offer Web3 services to the whole globe, and digital identity frameworks are being rolled out on a global scale.  Take global brands such as Nike and Celebrity Cruises that are getting into Web3. Perhaps most notably, coffee giant Starbucks is reworking its hugely important loyalty program by implementing its Starbucks Odyssey NFTs (non-fungible tokens) to create an accessible and engaging Web3 community.  Read more: Starbucks Launches Beta of Web3 'Odyssey' Loyalty Program  Meanwhile, payments giant PayPal has just teamed up with non-custodial wallet app MetaMask to make it easier for people to get involved with cryptocurrencies and Web3 in general. Blockchain-native identities matter in each and every case here, and have potential to improve existing Web standards.  Significantly more secure  The world is primed with many use cases ripe for this technology to address. Anybody will be able to send and receive safe digital payments in just a few clicks. Personal messaging can also be kept completely private while being secure from spoofing or impersonators. Even sensitive material like medical records can be linked to the ID in an encrypted manner.  These and numerous other applications stand to make many aspects of life much easier and significantly more secure. Further, it rebalances the scales between those that produce data and those who need it.  In commercial applications, for instance, people could get additional rewards for sharing their data. Companies could offer perks, bonuses and rewards directly to their users based on assets within their digital identity profiles, enabling countless new opportunities for brands and consumers to participate in a vibrant Web3 ecosystem.  The coming year is bound to see some exciting developments unfold in the Web3 space. There’s no putting the genie back into the bottle. With so many new businesses entering the field, it’s time for people to begin future-proofing themselves.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Sandy  Carter,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/12/28/how-web3-helps-people-take-control-of-their-digital-identity,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/23fe2614ab1bfce383280e431d8ebd702f24fdad-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

As NewsBTC reported, the rumor originated from an anonymous source in the Terra Classic community. However, the credibility of the rumor is more than questionable. Nevertheless, the community seemed to believe the rumor that Coinbase has approved the purchase of $245 million in LUNC and will make the listing on the exchange public on January 3. The price subsequently rose from a low of $0.000125988 on Dec. 22 to a three-week high of $0.000185499 on Dec. 27. With this, the Terra Luna predecessor token saw a price increase of around 46%, bucking the current market trend. Related Reading: Terra Luna Classic Up 6% On Rumor That Coinbase Is Buying LUNC However, the euphoria was dampened today by Binance after the crypto exchange announced that it is making changes to the Terra Classic trading fee burn. Binance stated that following recent developments as outlined in proposal 10983 and proposal 11111, it will burn 50% of LUNC spot and margin trading fees instead of 100% starting in December 2022. By doing so, Binance is following the community’s proposals that LUNC burn will be converted into a development fund. Binance’s change is thus done in line with the community’s intent to further reduce LUNC supply and in line with what they have agreed upon. To allow time for these new updates to be implemented, Binance will delay sending out the LUNC trading fee burn postings until January 3, 2023. Related Reading: Terra Classic (LUNC) Beats The Odds With 16% Rally, More Gains Ahead “Binance will continue to work with the community to support the implementation of this new plan, and if for any reason this is not possible, Binance will consider removing the burn contribution in the future,” the exchange added. LUNC Price Poised For More Gains? Since the high on December 27, the LUNC price has already lost about 16% of its price appreciation again. At press time, Terra Classic was trading at $0.000157195, down 11% over the last 24 hours. The trading volume within the same period was $245 million, down a modest -1.4% from the previous period. A look at the 1-day chart reveals that on Boxing Day, the Terra Classic price managed to break out of a downtrend channel that has persisted since October. Today’s correction could represent a retest of the move, so traders should keep an eye on the $0.0001406 area. Support could also be provided by the 50-day simple moving average (SMA), which sits at $0.000162919. Otherwise, the 200-day SMA at $0.000179240 should be decisive as the next resistance for the Terra Classic price.

Uniswap is seen to win the popular vote as it topples other cryptocurrencies in the social arena. Here’s a quick look at how it is performing: UNI price drops 1.26% Uniswap critical support spotted at $5.09 UNI dominates the crypto space in terms of social dominance On the other hand, UNI still looks bearish, which could linger on for quite some time. According to data by CoinMarketCap, UNI price was trading at $5.07, down 5.2% in the last seven days. Related Reading: NEAR Struggles As Bulls Aim To Flip $1.45 Resistance Into Support Source: CoinMarketCap The price could even slide further down if the coin fails to hold on to its current support level. The MACD histogram has fallen below zero, which indicates an increase in the amount of pressure being exerted by sellers. UNI Technical Indicators: Seller Aggressiveness Uniswap’s technical indicators show that sellers are more aggressive than buyers in the coming days. Uniswap, with the daily trading session, hinted at the formation of a descending triangle pattern. It also demonstrates a long-term bearish trend considering that the price dangles within the 100 and 200 SMA. Chart: TradingView The upper Bollinger Band sits at $5.25, while the lower Bollinger Band is currently at $5.32, which suggests a bearish trend for Uniswap. This market pattern is seen to continue for an extended period. Related Reading: Chiliz (CHZ) Finds Cover At This Level For Some Temporary Relief UNI total market cap at $3.8 billion on the daily chart | Chart: TradingView.com On the brighter side, Uniswap’s price may increase once it successfully breaches the $5.4 level. However, if the coin barrels past the key support level, it could aggravate the losses. Now, in order to reverse the negative sentiment, the bulls should maintain the support level and push the prices way up. UNI Search Volume Among Traders Climb In terms of social dominance and volume, UNI sits at 6,902 crests, which means that search volume has increased among the traders. Traders now see the spike in social dominance as an opportunity to rake in profit from UNI. In fact, Binance funding has increased by 0.009%. However, despite the spike in investor interest, Uniswap still needs to increase in value. In November, Uniswap rolled out an NFT aggregator as the market was bullish then. However, the tide has turned, and UNI NFTs did not seem to tickle the fancy of many investors as NFT trades have plummeted to only $7,562. While UNI is dominating social volume and dominance, this might not go on for long, as the social volume and price seem to plunge further in the coming days.",NEUTRAL,UNI,BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | UNI | BNB,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://newsbtc.com/news/uniswap-tops-other-big-crypto/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

Then on Saturday, the company acquired an additional 810 bitcoins for $13.6 million, bringing its total holdings up to 132,500 bitcoins. That's worth about $2.25 billion at current prices, compared with MicroStrategy's acquisition cost of $4 billion.  The sale last week marks the first time MicroStrategy has sold bitcoin since it began acquiring the cryptocurrency in 2020.  In sum, since Nov. 1, the company added about 2,501 bitcoins to its holdings, spending a net $44.6 million.

6569286,https://newsbtc.com/?p=513979,1672230619,Cardano (ADA) Extremely Undervalued? On-Chain Data Suggests So,"Cardano is one of the altcoins that has been hit the hardest by the bear market. Created by former Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson, the coin is 91.6% below its all-time high of $3.10, which was reached on September 1, 2021. Thus, ADA is performing much worse than its main competitor Ethereum. ETH reached its all-time high of $4.878 on November 10, 2021, and is currently about -75.4% below that level. However, according to on-chain analytics service Santiment, there are early signs of a trend reversal. For instance, sharks and whales holding 100,000 to 10 million ADA have been accumulating aggressively over the past six weeks. As the analyst writes, there is currently a bullish divergence between price and whale activity. A look at realized gains and losses also paints a bullish picture. According to the analyst, there are signs of seller exhaustion. “On every big price decrease there are fewer and fewer coins moving at a loss,” the analyst notes. Furthermore, the Santiment analyst says that Cardano (ADA) is facing a trading volume gap in the $0.19 to $0.26 range, where he expects the price to see “serious buying.” “Based on the things mentioned above, I believe price will increase in value. However, without any other data, it is difficult to accurately assess the validity of this analysis,” the analyst concluded. Messari Research Assesses The Current State Of Cardano An analysis of the state of the Cardano network was also published yesterday by Messari. In the research, the company provides interesting insights into the growth of the network, but at the same time, how it is lagging behind its main competitors. Related Reading: Cardano Price Consolidates, When Should You Short Again? As Messari notes, Cardano experienced an increase in DeFi activity in 2022, with daily transactions leveling off at around 60,000 since the second quarter, which equates to an average of around 0.75 transactions per second (TPS). Cardano’s DeFi TVL was approximately $78 million at the end of the third quarter of 2022. With a market cap of $14.8 billion, the project has a market cap/TVL ratio of 190, significantly higher than competitors Ethereum, Solana, and Binance with ratios of 6, 17, and 10, respectively, Messari said. Despite its relatively late entry into the DeFi space, Cardano’s TVL ranks 30th, with Minswap, WingRiders, and SundaeSwap dominating the DeFi ecosystem with 52%, 20%, and 19% market shares, respectively. In the NFT space, Cardano is hosting 8,000 NFT projects and 15 marketplaces but is only generating an average monthly volume of $6.8 million. This, as Messari notes, is a far cry from industry leader Ethereum, which has over $150 million in monthly volume. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Price Prediction: Downtrend Far From Over, $0.22 Still In Play According to the analytics firm, Cardano’s ethos of “building carefully and deliberately with extensive reviews” is one reason it forfeited a potential first-mover advantage with its proof of stake. According to Messari, the goal of the Hoskinson-led project must be to catch up with established ecosystems and capture market share in the near future. its market cap and decentralization are ahead of most competitors. However, Cardano’s ecosystem is still far behind the competition despite its growth this year. Cardano’s goal in the near future will be to catch up to established ecosystems and take some market share. ADA Price Trapped In Downtrend A look at the 1-day chart reveals that the ADA price has been in a downtrend channel since August, which could spell further doom. At a current price of $0.251, the ADA price is as low as it was last in January 2021. To initiate an uptrend, ADA would first need to reclaim the 50-day moving average at around $0.30 in order to break out of the trend channel at around $0.34.

42388319,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRDY2p,1672230300,"Ethereum’s 2022 in Review: The Merge, MEV and Mayhem","In 2022, Ethereum ticked off several boxes on its checklist toward creating a global computer and decentralized financial system. Most notably, the second-largest blockchain finally completed its radical shift to a new, vastly more energy-friendly system for powering its network.  But the year was also marked with problems – from concerns around censorship to record-shattering hacks on Ethereum-linked infrastructure.  Let’s dive into the major themes and events that have defined Ethereum’s rollercoaster year.  The Merge  Any recap of Ethereum’s 2022 would be incomplete without mention of the Merge – the blockchain’s massive, years-in-the-making upgrade to a more energy-efficient system for processing transactions.  Ethereum’s switch to proof-of-stake from proof-of-work, which happened in September, marked a massive reduction to the network’s energy footprint, ditching a power-hungry crypto mining system in favor of a new method for issuing and validating transactions on the blockchain.  Read more: The Ethereum Merge Is Done, Opening a New Era for the Second-Biggest Blockchain  Although the Merge did not address Ethereum’s relatively high transaction costs and slow network speeds, it is estimated to have cut the network’s energy consumption by around 99%.  But the Merge wasn’t all good news. Ethereum’s new power structure, where validators “stake” ether (ETH) with the chain for the chance to write transactions to its ledger, has led to charges that it is becoming too centralized. Also, while the Merge put Ethereum on a path to becoming a deflationary asset, the event came in the midst of a bear market and never spurred a long-hoped-for bump to the price of ether (ETH), the chain’s native currency. The price of ETH has sunk more than 20% since the Merge.  Over the past year, there have also been increasing signs that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will seek to classify Ethereum and other proof-of-stake currencies as securities (rather than commodities). Such a classification could lead to major changes in how the network is used and how ETH is taxed and traded.  MEV and flashbots  Ethereum’s Merge ushered in changes to the world of MEV, or Maximum Extractable Value.  As the Ethereum Foundation explains, “Maximal extractable value (MEV) refers to the maximum value that can be extracted from block production in excess of the standard block rewards and gas fees by including, excluding, and changing the order of transactions in a block.”  Read more: What Is MEV, aka Maximal Extractable Value?  In the early days of MEV before 2020, its spoils were generally restricted to a handful of sophisticated miners and a new cadre of so-called “searchers” – bots that scoured Ethereum’s transaction backlog, called the mempool, for profitable trading opportunities. For a while, the concentration of MEV know-how in the hands of just a few actors led to the proliferation of MEV-optimized trading strategies, like bandit attacks, which had the consequence of screwing over regular traders.  In 2020, the research firm Flashbots burst onto the scene with a system designed to mitigate some of the issues with centralized MEV. That system, an auction house for MEV-optimized blocks, became responsible for around 50% of all Ethereum blocks by September’s Merge. From January to September 2022, Flashbots netted over $200 million in profit for miners according to the company’s public dashboards – turning MEV from a nuisance into an entire cottage industry.  Once the Merge hit and changed the way blocks are produced on Ethereum, Flashbots only grew in importance. Its new system for spreading out the spoils of MEV, called MEV-Boost, is currently used as a go-between for 90% of the blocks on Ethereum’s new proof-of-stake network.  Though Flashbots’ 2022 was undoubtedly one of success, the company has faced rising concern that it is making Ethereum’s block production apparatus too centralized – an ironic charge given that Flasbots initially came along with the goal of mitigating centralization.  Censorship and centralization  In addition to the accusation that Flashbots (along with some of Ethereum’s larger validators) risk centralizing Ethereum, in recent months the MEV firm has been followed by an even more pernicious narrative. Ask folks like Gnosis Chain founder Martin Köppelman, and they’ll point out – as we’ve covered exhaustively in past editions of the Valid Points newsletter – that Flashbots has, by dint of its increasing influence on Ethereum block production, led to increased censorship on the network.  Read more: Will Censorship Fork Ethereum?  Over the Summer, the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) made headlines when it sanctioned Tornado Cash – an Ethereum-based program for obscuring the source of crypto transactions.  For Ethereum’s validators and users, it remains unclear exactly what sorts of activities would be considered illegal under OFAC’s rules, which bar “facilitating” or “servicing” sanctioned parties. For instance, even if it’s clearly illegal for users to shuffle funds through Tornado Cash, is it illegal for validators to “attest” to the validity of blocks containing those transactions?  Moreover, some blockchain developers thought that OFAC, by sanctioning a smart contract, violated free speech. For those who believe Ethereum should be a “credibly neutral” platform, blocking off sanctioned transactions in any form amounted to a kind of censorship – even if, for now, those transactions can still find ways onto Ethereum’s ledger, albeit at a slight delay relative to other transactions.  Along with certain validators, Flashbots – and some of the more popular third-party “relayers” that deliver blocks to validators using Flashbots’ MEV-Boost program – have taken actions that curtail the ability for Tornado-linked transactions to make it onto the Ethereum ledger. According to MEV Watch – a watchdog group that tracks Ethereum censorship – around 70% of the blocks that get added to Ethereum’s network each day are OFAC-compliant, meaning they are assembled to exclude (or “censor”) transactions from OFAC-sanctioned addresses.  Censorship was a major point of contention for the Ethereum community towards the tail end of 2022, and one expects to see it become even more relevant as users, validators and regulators formulate a clearer viewpoint on what financial compliance should mean for Ethereum and other blockchains.  Scalability and zero knowledge  At the peak of crypto’s 2020-2021 bull run, Ethereum – the second-largest blockchain by transaction volume – became virtually unusable for some people as a result of its high fees and slow speeds relative to some newer blockchains. But 2022 saw major improvements in this regard with the growing popularity of layer 2 networks and sidechains – separate networks that process transactions for cheap and then “settle” them on the main Ethereum blockchain.  Read more: What Are Layer 2s and Why Are They Important?  2022 was a huge year for Polygon, the biggest sidechain platform whose marketing might and Rolodex of strategic partners made it the envy of competing chains. The Polygon team managed to attract a horde of celebrities and corporate partners onto its sidechain, and despite concerns around centralization and security, its decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFT markets became a popular entry point for many-a-crypto-trader priced out of Ethereum’s expensive mainnet.  This past year also saw a rise in the popularity of layer 2 rollup networks like Arbitrum and Optimism. These optimistic rollup chains, which both launched in 2021, are slightly more expensive than sidechains like Polygon, but they provide stronger security guarantees to users – meaning they have special systems in place to ensure that the transactions they pass down to Ethereum’s base chain haven’t been spoofed or tampered with.  2022 was also the year of the zero-knowledge (ZK) rollup, layer 2 chains that use fancy ZK cryptography in order to guarantee transaction integrity. This past fall, several firms – among them, Polygon, Matter Labs and Scroll – made major progress in the development of so-called zkEVMS, which are ZK-rollups that can host any Ethereum smart contract (previously, ZK rollups were limited to specific applications and use-cases).  Read more: What Are Rollups? ZK Rollups and Optimistic Rollups Explained  As Ethereum’s layer 2 chains duke it out over the next several months and years, it's expected that one (or several) of them will eventually become the primary means by which most users access Ethereum in the years ahead.  Mishaps and mayhem  One would be remiss to discuss Ethereum’s 2022 without mentioning the myriad of blowups, hacks and failures that have made this year one of the most disastrous in crypto history.  According to Rekt, a website that keeps a running list of DeFi exploits ordered by the amount of money lost, seven of the ten largest-ever DeFi hacks occurred in 2022.  Things teed off in February with the $326 million attack of Solana’s Wormhole bridge, which allowed users to trade assets between Solana and Ethereum (as well as some other, smaller chains). The largest-ever crypto exploit took place the following month when the Ronin network – an Ethereum sidechain used for the Axie Infinity web3 game – was hacked for an eye-watering $625 million.  Ethereum’s core code has never been the victim of an exploit (the systems that were attacked on Wormhole and Ronin weren’t even technically on Ethereum), but most of the big DeFi thefts of this past year nonetheless wrought havoc on users of Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem. They showed, moreover, that apps on Ethereum and other blockchains – particularly, the bridges that let you send assets from chain to chain – have a long way to go in terms of security.  But the failures of the past year were also proof for many of the necessity of decentralized financial infrastructure. The much-publicized FTX exchange fiasco, wherein Sam Bankman-Fried and his associates allegedly stole around $8 billion in user funds, was only possible because people entrusted their money with an intermediary. Future Ethereum development, as with past development, will focus on ensuring that users can transact and store assets without the use of middlemen.  Such a future, while perhaps more necessary than ever, will continue to prove elusive until Ethereum, and the apps built atop it, continue to improve their security and ease of use.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MATIC | TRADING | ZK,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/12/28/ethereums-2022-in-review-the-merge-mev-and-mayhem,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2a0b1d2938569f0e989114b2d52cd438830e1df2-6000x4500.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Litecoin Addresses Holding More Than 1,000 LTC Now At Highest Level Since 2020 As per data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, LTC has been climbing strongly since the population of these large addresses began to rise. The relevant indicator here is the “Litecoin Supply Distribution,” which tells us how many addresses (or holders) belong to each wallet group in the market currently. Addresses are put into these wallet groups based on the total number of coins that they are currently holding. For example, the 1-10 coins band includes all addresses that are holding between 1 and 10 LTC right now. The Supply Distribution metric for this band would then measure the total amount of such addresses that are there in the market currently. Related Reading: Analyst Explains Why Ethereum Is Bullish Against Bitcoin Now, the wallet groups of interest in the current discussion are those with at least 1,000 LTC. Since there is no upper bound here, all balances ranging from this amount to infinity are stacked together. Here is the Supply Distribution chart for these Litecoin address bands: Looks like the value of the metric has been sharply going up in recent days | Source: Santiment As the above graph displays, the value of the indicator for Litecoin addresses falling inside this range has been rising since May of this year. Holders that have 1,000 or more coins in their wallets are sharks and whales, so this uptrend implies that the total number of these large investors has been going up in the last few months. Just recently, the address count of these holders hit a value of 4,232, which is the highest value recorded in more than two years. From the chart, it’s also visible that while these sharks and whales have been increasing in number (and hence accumulation has been going on), the LTCBTC ratio has seen a rise of more than 130%. Related Reading: Why The Bitcoin Mining Hashrate May Not Be Out Of The Woods Just Yet Since this accumulation hasn’t seemed to have slowed down recently, it’s possible that it could sustain further appreciation in the price of Litecoin heading into 2023. LTC’s next halving, an event where its supply production would be cut in half, is also scheduled to take place in the August of next year and has historically had a bullish effect on the price as well. LTC Price At the time of writing, Litecoin’s price floats around $67, up 4% in the last week.

The largest crypto asset boasting a total market capitalization of $320.76 billion has so far failed to establish a strong upward momentum that will enable it to exit 2022 with a higher value. In fact, BTC, which is trading at $16,658, is in danger of ending the year with a meager gain of less than 2%. At the time of writing, the maiden crypto has only managed to go up by 1.2% during the last 30 days and is looking at a weekly decline of 1.5%. As Bitcoin continues with its struggles, lesser known altcoins such as NEAR will also have a hard time to trigger an upward movement of their prices. Related Reading: Chiliz (CHZ) Finds Cover At This Level For Some Temporary Relief Yearend Bang Denied As NEAR Drops 20% Much like many of its fellow digital coins, NEAR is now trapped in a position where it will be difficult to end the month of December on a high note. NEAR Protocol has the strongest positive correlations with Bitcoin, Cardano, and XRP. This suggests that these coins frequently trend in the same direction at the same time. According to latest data from Coingecko, at press time, NEAR is changing hands at $1.32 and has already lost 20% of its value in the last 14 days. As for its month-to-date (MTD) performance, the coin is currently one of the worst performers among the top 40 crypto assets, going down by 16.2% over the previous 30 days. Adding to the woes of the cryptocurrency is the findings of Investors Observer, which gave the altcoin a moderate volatility rank of 39, putting NEAR in the bottom 39% of all cryptocurrencies in the market. Bulls are also put in a tough spot as they now bear the responsibility of flipping the resistance region of $1.45 into support zone to trigger some sort of a bullish movement.

42388309,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRDXDN,1672210800,Bitcoin Miner Argo Blockchain Will Avoid Bankruptcy With $100M Bailout From Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital,"Bitcoin miner Argo Blockchain (ARBK) will avoid filing for bankruptcy protection after it agreed to sell its Helios mining facility in Dickens Country, Texas, to Galaxy Digital for $65 million.  The miner will also get a new $35 million loan from noted investor Michael Novogratz’s crypto-focused financial-services firm, which will be secured by Argo's mining equipment, according to a statement sent to CoinDesk.  ""Over the last few months, we have been looking for a way to continue mining through the bear market, reduce our debt load and maintain access to the unique power grid in Texas,"" Argo CEO Peter Wall told CoinDesk. ""This deal with Galaxy achieves all of these goals, and it lets us live to fight another day.""  The transaction will help Argo bolster its balance sheet and avoid bankruptcy after it found itself in a precarious situation when a deal for $27 million in funding fell through in October. Earlier this month, the miner said that it was in advanced negotiations to sell some of its assets and carry out an equipment financing transaction to avoid filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.  The deal with Galaxy was structured to boost Argo's balance sheet and capital structure, Chris Ferraro, president and chief investment officer at Galaxy, told CoinDesk. When the miner kicked off its process, ""we were in a position to solve the problem completely for Argo, while accelerating the expansion of our own mining capabilities,” he added.  The crypto miner's shares more than doubled in early London Stock Exchange trading. On Tuesday, the company requested a 24-hour suspension of trading in its Nasdaq-listed stock, while the London market was closed for a U.K. bank holiday.  Argo is among several miners that are struggling to stay afloat amid rising energy costs low bitcoin (BTC) prices.  Earlier this month, Core Scientific (CORZ), one of the largest miners by computing power, filed for bankruptcy, and in September, Compute North, another major firm in the sector, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Last week, bitcoin miner Greenidge said that it reached a debt restructuring deal with its lender Nydig, although the prospects of a bankruptcy filing still loom.  Texas-sized center  Helios, which was Argo's largest mining facility, has up to 180 megawatts worth of power capacity and will become Galaxy's flagship mining operation. The facility started operations in May under Argo, with a plan to reach 800 megawatts of energy consumption and 20 exahash/second of computing power.

""Quality infrastructure and access to low-cost energy are the cornerstones of a successful mining operation, making the acquisition of Helios an incredible milestone for the growth of Galaxy’s mining business,"" Amanda Fabiano, head of mining at Galaxy, said in a statement.

Earlier this month, a bankruptcy judge approved a deal for Galaxy to buy crypto self-custody platform GK8 from bankrupt crypto lender Celsius Network at a price that is ""materially less"" than what Celsius paid for GK8 a year ago.  Helios will be the second bitcoin mining facility that Galaxy will own and operate as the firm said it is working on multiple longer-term solutions to diversify and reduce counterparty risk for its mining unit. Galaxy recently started construction on its first proprietary mining site in Texas, which is expected to be fully operational by January, according to its third-quarter earnings report.  “Galaxy is aspiring to be one of the most trusted nodes of the decentralized future,” Ferraro said in the statement. “The acquisition of Helios represents a new stage over our two-year journey in bitcoin mining that increases our operating scale and breadth of solutions, creating sustainable value for the biggest decentralized digital-asset network and shareholders alike.""

6542090,https://newsbtc.com/?p=513928,1672194692,Exploiter Of “Highly Profitable Trading Strategy” Arrested In Puerto Rico,"A few months can feel like a lifetime in crypto. However, it probably hasn’t felt like long enough for Mango Markets exploiter Avraham Eisenberg, who was taken into custody in Puerto Rico this week. Eisenberg gained notoriety on crypto Twitter after describing his nine-figure exploit of the Solana-based protocol as “a highly profitable trading strategy.” On Twitter and across other outlets, Eisenberg was insistent that his exploit was simply taking advantage of the protocol’s code, and that his actions weren’t illegal or even immoral. However, U.S. federal prosectors seem to disagree. An Exploiter’s Endeavor In October, Eisenberg exploited Solana-based Mango Markets and made headlines not just for the exploit – which was essentially a ‘looping’ exploit, manipulating the price of the MNGO token – but also for the outlandishly-sized ‘bug bounty’ that Eisenberg managed to walk away with. B ug bounties are commonplace for exploiters – often ‘white hat’ exploiters who look to take advantage of code for the ‘better of society’ – but never have amounted to a payout this large. While Eisenberg attempted to include language in a Mango protocol proposal that could shield him from “criminal investigations,” that didn’t slow the U.S. DoJ and FBI from looking into his activity. At the time of our October publishing on the matter, it was unclear if Mango would be able to make a recovery; little did we know how much damage the Solana ecosystem would face in the 60 days following that event. Since the exploiter’s endeavor, Solana’s defi landscape has crumbled, FTX fallout has impacted the chain drastically, and it’s once flagship NFT community is facing intense pressure with the departure of signature projects DeGods and y00ts. Mango Markets (MNGO) was taken advantage of by an exploiter who has been arrested this week. | Source: MNGO-USD on TradingView.com Related Reading: Dogecoin Among Most Searched Cryptos Of The Year, Will It Keep Its Spot In 2023? Mango Madness, Continued Court documents have been unveiled this week, shedding light on Eisenberg’s arrest in Puerto Rico. An initial filing, dated December 23, 2022 and released this week, federal prosecutors outline two separate charges surrounding Eisenberg’s “scheme involving the intentional and artificial manipulation of the price of perpetual futures contracts” on Mango. The 14-page filing details how Eisenberg manipulated MNGO perps, detailing his movement between wallets. The filing closes by mentioning that Eisenberg attempted to flee law enforcement by swiftly departing the U.S. to Israel, and highlights the belief that Eisenberg was well aware of the illegality of his actions, based on Twitter activity. The document is rounded out by a request from the FBI agent to issue a warrant for Eisenberg’s arrest. A second filing, dated December 27, confirms his arrest in Puerto Rico. Crypto Twitter rejoiced with memes surrounding Eisenberg’s arrest.

6537965,https://newsbtc.com/?p=513883,1672189253,"Cardano Price Consolidates, When Should You Short Again?","The Cardano price had increased over the weekend, but the coin showed lateral price movement at press time. Over the last 24 hours, ADA has dipped about 0.2%. The ADA has gained 4% in the last week, indicating a positive trend. According to the technical outlook, the Cardano price has not yet reversed its price action. The downtrend continues despite the coin securing minor gains over the last few days. The buying strength remained low, which depicted lower accumulation as well. Cardano bounced back from oversold territory, but the selling momentum was still strong. With the Bitcoin price falling and fluctuating between $16,900 and $16,600, altcoins have also seen choppy and undecided price movements. Following major market movers, ADA traded between $0.26 and $0.27, with the altcoin falling below the $0.25 price mark in the last 24 hours. The market has presented signs where buyers can make an entry to make some gains over the shorter trading timeframe. The trading volume of Cardano was low, indicating a lack of buyers. ADA is trading 91% below its all-time high secured in the last year. Related Reading: Terra Classic (LUNC) Beats The Odds With 16% Rally, More Gains Ahead Cardano Price Analysis: One-Day Chart ADA was trading at $0.25 at the time of writing. Because of the recent depreciation, ADA has lost its $0.26 support line. If buyers push harder, Cardano can be expected to trade above the $0.26 level again. The major mark of resistance for ADA stood at $0.28. As per the technical indicators, Cardano price might lose the $0.25 level before it starts to make upward strides again. That would mark an entry point for buyers and an appropriate shorting opportunity for traders. If the Cardano price fell below the $0.25 mark, the first support stood at $0.24 and then at $0.22. The amount of Cardano traded in the last session declined, signifying bearish price action. Technical Analysis Despite Cardano recovering from the undervalued zone, it still hovered close to the selling dominance zone. The Relative Strength Index was below the 40-mark with a downtick, which could lead to another fall in price before the altcoin makes a comeback. The Cardano price was below the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line, which meant sellers continued to drive the price momentum in the market. Traders shorting will make gains over the next trading sessions as ADA prepares to topple past the 20-SMA line. Bearish conditions prevailed for Cardano, as the other indicators also pointed in the same direction. The Directional Movement Index (DMI), which demonstrates the price direction and strength, was negative. The -DI line (orange) was above the -DI line (blue), indicating that sellers had more strength in the market. The Average Directional Index (red) was at 40, depicting increased strength in the current price direction. This reiterated that the bears were strong, which would mean another fall for ADA, which could benefit sellers. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence portrays the price momentum. The indicator just painted one small green signal bar, indicating that buyers could find an entry point now to log gains over the immediate trading session.

Due to the holiday season, the trading volume across global markets decreased, leading to stagnation in the nascent sector. Related Reading: Chiliz (CHZ) Finds Cover At This Level For Some Temporary Relief As of this writing, Dogecoin trades at $0.074 with a 1% loss in the last 24 hours.

Dogecoin Shares Spot With Bitcoin And Shiba Inu As Most Popular Cryptocurrencies Per a report from DollarGeek, cryptocurrencies remain some of the most searched digital financial assets of 2022. According to data from Google, cryptocurrencies total over 7 million monthly searches in the United States and over 40 million global searches. Despite the persistent downside trend in its prices and unfavorable macroeconomic conditions, the digital asset class remained popular. The report claims. Bitcoin preserved its spot as the most popular cryptocurrency. Over the past two years, several new sectors emerged from the crypto industry. However, people are still attracted to Bitcoin due to its decentralized nature. 2022 has been a year of declining trust in a central authority. In this environment, people take more interest in alternatives, such as Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The benchmark crypto recorded about 4,500,000 monthly searches in the U.S. and 28,400,000 global searches. Further down the line of popular cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin and Shiba Inu took the number two and three positions. The meme coins continued to take over market share from other significant projects. In the last months of 2022, Dogecoin and Shiba Inu claimed the previous positions in the crypto top 10 by market cap and often competed. In terms of Google searches, SHIBA and DOGE showed mixed results. According to the report, the meme coin recorded around 1,290,000 monthly searches in the U.S., but in terms of global monthly searches, Dogecoin took the crown. This cryptocurrency recorded around 6,000,000 monthly searches compared to the 4,400,000 million from SHIBA. DOGE To See Further Growth In Popularity Per the report, the dominant trends in the crypto industry can be divided into meme coins, represented by Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and innovative contract platforms, represented by Ethereum and Avalanche. Finally, people took an interest in old cryptocurrencies revamping their ecosystem with new features, represented by Cardano and Litecoin.

Insights: In this last week of 2022, First Mover Asia isrevisiting a few of CoinDesk's (CD) best, most impactful stories from the past year. Less than a month after a CD story led to the implosion of crypto exchange giant FTX in November, Chief Insights Columnist David Z. Morris zeroed in on the seriousness of CEO Sam Bankman-Fried's offenses. The U.S. Department of Justice subsequently charged Bankman-Fried with wire fraud and other alleged crimes. After posting bail, he is confined to his parents California home except to exercise, and must wear a tracking device.

Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Frozen Markets, a Bitcoin Drift  By James Rubin  Bitcoin drifted lower in Tuesday trading, albeit not by much as investors continued their historical, year-end hibernation. Crypto prices remain frozen near the levels they've held for much of the past two weeks.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently changing hands at $16,700, off 1.3% over the past 24 hours but near its most recent support just under $17,000. BTC's price has remained resilient over the past two months, despite the widening fallout from the implosion of crypto exchange FTX.  In a CoinDesk TV First Mover interview, Martin Leinweber, digital asset product strategist at Market Vector Indexes, noted bitcoin's strength relative to other cryptos. ""If you look at the coins that demonstrate relative strength, which means coins that fell the least amount from the all-time high, you will notice names that nearly no one would have imagined, especially when you consider the ranking,"" Leinweber said. ""So bitcoin was not the most defensive coin, one might expect from a store of value.""  Ether was recently trading just over $1,200, also down 1.3% from Monday, same time. Most other major cryptos were slightly in the red with LINK, the token of software platform Chainlink, and CRO, the native cryptocurrency of exchange Crypto.com, each sinking more than 2%. The CoinDesk Market Index (CDI), an index measuring cryptos' performance, fell 1.15%.  Major equity indexes closed mixed after a good news, bad news day in which China announced it would allow international travelers to enter the country again but Russia said it would ban oil sales to countries that had placed a $60 per barrel price cap on it – the latest fallout from Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. How the moves will affect prices worldwide is uncertain. Brent crude oil, a widely watched measure of global energy markets, was recently selling at $85 per barrel, an 11% gain over the past three weeks. The tech-heavy Nasdaq slipped 1.4%, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average ticked up slightly.  Meanwhile, FTX's sad, unsavory saga continued with documents filed in Caribbean court showing that former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried borrowed hundreds of millions of dollars from Alameda Research to purchase his stake in trading app Robinhood Markets (HOOD).  In an affidavit before his arrest, Bankman-Fried said he and FTX co-founder Gary Wang together borrowed over $546 million from Alameda via promissory notes in April and May. They used that money to capitalize Emergent Fidelity Technologies Ltd., the shell corporation that in May bought a 7.6% stake of Robinhood.  The FTX crisis has renewed calls for stronger regulation some seven months after the TerraUSD (UST) stablecoin lost its dollar peg. The consequent collapse of the Terra ecosystem during the spring jolted lawmakers who had been hesitating to create stricter guidelines targeting digital assets to ratchet up their efforts. As yet, little concrete has resulted, although many crypto insiders expect changes in the year ahead and beyond to protect investors.  Market Vector Indexes' Leinweber said he would embrace stablecoin regulation. ""I welcome those regulations,"" he said. ""It will lead to more dollars in that space. There are some unregulated, poorer constructed ones. But they're also good stablecoins.""

Morris, CoinDesk Chief Insights Columnist  In the weeks since Sam Bankman-Fried’s cryptocurrency empire was revealed to be a house of lies, mainstream news organizations and commentators have often failed to give their readers a straightforward assessment of exactly what happened. August institutions including the New York Times and Wall Street Journal have uncovered many key facts about the scandal, but they have also repeatedly seemed to downplay the facts in ways that soft-pedaled Bankman-Fried’s intent and culpability.  It is now clear that what happened at the FTX crypto exchange and the hedge fund Alameda Research involved a variety of conscious and intentional fraud intended to steal money from both users and investors. That’s why a recent New York Times interview was widely derided for seeming to frame FTX’s collapse as the result of mismanagement rather than malfeasance. A Wall Street Journal article bemoaned the loss of charitable donations from FTX, arguably propping up Bankman-Fried’s strategic philanthropic pose. Vox co-founder Matthew Yglesias, court chronicler of the neoliberal status quo, seemed to whitewash his own entanglements by crediting Bankman-Fried’s money with helping Democrats in the 2020 elections – sidestepping the likelihood that the money was effectively embezzled.  Perhaps most perniciously, many outlets have described what happened to FTX as a “bank run” or a “run on deposits,” while Bankman-Fried has repeatedly insisted the company was simply overleveraged and disorganized. Both of these attempts to frame the fallout obfuscate the core issue: the misuse of customer funds.  Banks can be hit by “bank runs” because they are explicitly in the business of lending customer funds out to generate returns. They can experience a short-term cash crunch if everyone withdraws at the same time, without there being any long-term problem.  But FTX and other crypto exchanges are not banks. They do not (or should not) do bank-style lending, so even a very acute surge of withdrawals should not create a liquidity strain. FTX had specifically promised customers it would never lend out or otherwise use the crypto they entrusted to the exchange.  CoinDesk's Chief Insights Columnist David Z. Morris unpacks his latest opinion piece that argues Sam Bankman-Fried, former CEO of troubled crypto exchange FTX, is a fraud.  See also: Divisions in Sam Bankman-Fried's Crypto Empire Blur on Alameda's Balance Sheet  In reality, the funds were sent to the intimately linked trading firm Alameda Research, where they were, it seems, simply gambled away. This is, in the simplest terms, theft at a nearly unprecedented scale. While the total losses have yet to be quantified, up to one million customers could be impacted, according to a bankruptcy document.
