42377934,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LVex,1421609115,Federal Reserve Bank VP: We’re a Protocol Just Like Bitcoin,"An interest in bitcoin and digital currency makes Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis vice president and research director David Andolfatto something of a rarity among Fed officials. However, while he may see the technology’s big picture, why he believes bitcoin is potentially transformative doesn’t exactly fall in line with the common mantras of the community.  Take, for instance, the claim that bitcoin is part of a long-term trend toward “digital money”, one Andolfatto delights in debunking.  Today, virtually all money used by the private banking sector, and all the money in modern economies, he asserts, is digital.  In a conversation with CoinDesk, Andolfatto went so far as to suggest that the bitcoin network isn’t that much different from the Federal Reserve, and that while ideologically opposed, both are highly similar in their structure and goals. The St Louis Fed is just one of 12 banks that make up the US Federal Reserve System, which supervises state-member banks, bank holding companies and loan holding companies, and provides educational outreach.  Andolfatto said:  “The way I view the Fed, and any institution, is it’s basically a computer program. Just like bitcoin, it’s an open-source computer program. You ask yourself, ‘What is bitcoin?’ It’s a protocol, it’s a computer program, it’s a constitution, it’s a law, it’s a legal code, it’s basically a constitution that governs the supply of its money and that governs the processing of payments.”  Still, Andolfatto does believe bitcoin has one key advantage that he has called its “stroke of genius” in past presentations – its open-source decentralized ledger known as the blockchain.  In contrast to the Federal Reserve Wire Networkhttps://www.frbservices.org/fedwire/ (Fedwire), the US central bank’s real-time settlement system, Andolfatto believes bitcoin, or a similar blockchain-based system could pose real benefits for centralised financial institutions like the Fed.  The comments come as part of a wide-ranging interview that sought to gather Andolfatto’s opinion on bitcoin as a currency, payment network and financial tool that could grow in relevance to the global economy.  Bitcoin's competitive edge  With digital money out of the running as the big innovation behind bitcoin, Andolfatto has turned his interest to another often-cited aspect of the technology – its public ledger system, the blockchain.  Still, he questions whether the bitcoin network will prove to be more cost-effective than other available payment systems, and whether another similar system might ultimately solve the key problems he still sees in its design.  “The amount of money and resources you have to pay bitcoin miners is like 3% of all transactions,” he said. “That’s kind of like what Visa charges.”  With these often-cited benefits out of the running, however, Adolfatto is still interested in bitcoin because of one key benefit it has over the current system used by the Federal Reserve.  By using a distributed ledger, he said, every bank in the Federal Reserve system could have a copy of all transactions in the system, thereby guarding against potential problems inherent with a centralized approach.  “What would happen on the distributed ledger is all the books would be kept simultaneously in every one of these member banks, the same way that the blockchain is on everybody’s computer,” he said. “If any one computer goes down, that doesn’t in any way violate the integrity of the blockchain because the records still exist on all these copies of this ledger.”  Andolfatto indicated that such a feature could add a “robustness” to the Fed’s existing system, potentially even allowing the public more transparency during times of economic turmoil.  “You could actually see which bank is sending money to which bank on this ‘Fedcoin blockchain’, so if the Fed was to make an emergency loan to one of these entities you’d be able to observe who is the recipient of the loan and how much,” he theorized.  But if the bitcoin system has advantages, Andolfatto isn’t ready to make the case that they should be embraced by the Fed. Andolfatto cautioned that he doesn’t see the immediate need for financial institutions to migrate to public ledgers.  “To the extent that people would value that transparency – and I have to say that it’s not immediately clear you want that type of transparency – that would be another benefit,"" he said.  Bitcoin as a currency  In the past, Andolfatto has been bearish on bitcoin as a currency, arguing that distributed payment systems like Ripple come closest to unlocking the full power of bitcoin’s original ledger.  Unsurprisingly, he indicated that he doesn’t see the uptick in the merchant adoption of bitcoin as payment a sign that this conjecture might be wrong.  “People use all sorts of stuff as currency,” Andolfatto said. “There’s many, many currencies out there and the bitcoin currency is just one.”  Andolfatto countered with the assertion that, rather than a currency, bitcoin is considered by most to be an investment vehicle, a development he suggested might limit its ability to function more broadly as money.  “People see that in the long run the supply of bitcoin is capped and they see it’s demand growing, so in the long run you have to expect that it might be a good investment vehicle,” he said. “You might think the same about gold, but just because something’s a good investment vehicle does not make it a good currency.”  Andolfatto ended by citing the volatile exchange rate between bitcoin and US dollars, a subject that has been the subject of increasing attention in recent weeks.  “What makes a good currency is its ability to hold its value for very, very short periods of time,” he said, adding the caveat that developing markets where money is managed poorly might come to contradict his theory.  He continued, “I think there might be a big scope for cryptocurrencies like bitcoin to replace or at least take a good market share of currency transactions [in these areas].""  Comparisons to Fedwire  Perhaps most surprising was Andolfatto’s assertion that the bitcoin network is similar to the Federal Reserve, but he elaborated at length on the subject and why he believes all money is just a ledger.  In this context, he explained that all money attempts to perform a simple function, debiting an account and crediting another.  “Fedwire uses the US dollar as the currency unit and the Fed serves as the third party that does the accounting,” he said. “The key difference with bitcoin is that there’s no trusted third party to do the accounting. The accounting is done by this community of miners, this decentralized system. It’s a completely different philosophy.”  Still, he sees the Federal Reserve as an evolving system, one that is also “open source” due to its reliance of foundational laws.  “The Fed is a set of rules that evolved over time, much like the open-source bitcoin protocol does. It takes feedback from the community, in this case the community votes, represented by the Congress. Congress is the creator of the Fed, and so there are amendments to the way the fed might operate. As long as this occurs, I see the Fed as an open-source evolving protocol, much like bitcoin,” he said.  More pressing issues  While Andolfatto admits that he has followed the development of the bitcoin ecosystem, it wasn’t an intellectual curiosity that first lead him to speak out as part of his institution’s “Dialogue With the Fed” series. Rather, it was the work of a savvy PR team.  “This is an earlier in [2014] and public interest in the phenomenon was really cresting. It was one of those things our public affairs team identified as something we wanted to know more about,” Andolfatto recalled.  He indicated that, while the darling of the mainstream tech and finance press, most Federal Reserve economists aren’t thinking about bitcoin. Of the 1,000 or more on staff, he said that he is aware of just “pockets of researchers” that have looked at the issue.  “The thing to keep in mind is that there’s a lot on the minds of fed economists these days,” he added.  Still, he said he is encouraged by what he’s seen of the bitcoin ecosystem, particularly the technology’s enthusiastic fan base, which he cites as key to his never-say-never view of developments in the industry.  “My experience with meeting people [in the industry] has been highly, highly positive,” Andolfatto said. “They might not have a good understanding of money, monetary policy and macroeconomics and stuff like that, but they have a very, very good idea of the payment system, of how it works, the plumbing, and moreover and I've come away marveling at the energy and the ingenuity that these people have.”  He added: “I mean the entrepreneurs in this space, I am just in awe of.”  Images courtesy of the St Louis Fed",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | REGULATION | WALLET,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/01/18/federal-reserve-bank-vp-were-a-protocol-just-like-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/44595799622be2ae47d78a87c4b3a0f4e206a413-1280x565.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377936,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LVgD,1421594430,ChangeTip Now Allows Facebook Friends to Tip in Bitcoin,"Bitcoin microtransactions startup ChangeTip, which allows people to send bitcoin tips over social media, has now added Facebook to its list of supported platforms.  With the move, ChangeTip adds to its existing list of popular social media services, which include Twitter and Reddit.  However, the team framed the integration of Facebook as a notable step forward. By leveraging the world’s largest social network, the San Francisco-based company hopes to encourage more consumers to use bitcoin.  Dan Held, its newly appointed vice president for product, told CoinDesk:  ""With over 1 billion users, enabling this on Facebook opens up a unique way to bring new people into bitcoin.""  Sending a Facebook bitcoin tip  To send a bitcoin tip on Facebook, users first need to connect their accounts within the ChangeTip settings panel.  The Facebook option will show in ChangeTip's main tipping screen and the interface will populate the 'Send to' field with the user's Facebook friends.  While transactions are made in bitcoin, users can opt to specify the amount of their tips in fiat denominations, BTC or 'a moniker' – a nickname set in ChangeTip's platform, like 'cheeseburger', that indicates a certain value.  ""We want people to be creative on ChangeTip,"" Held said.  Once a tip is sent, it appears on the receiver's timeline, and the sender has the option to write a personal message on the post.  The ChangeTip team said it took several weeks to build the integration, but that the opportunity made it worth the effort.  ""Facebook is the biggest social media network, so it was a top priority for us,"" said Held.  There is also a ChangeTip app on Facebook where users can access the tipping tool.  Bitcoin microtransactions  The opportunity for building businesses around micropayments in cryptocurrencies is immense.  Even so, there isn't currently a dominant company in the space. Bitcoin services provider Coinbase has built a tipping tool, and startup Dogetipbot recently raised seed capital to facilitate dogecoin tips on sites like Reddit and Twitch.tv.  ChangeTip has raised more than $4m to date from investors such as Crypto Currency Partners and Pantera Capital.

42377937,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LVmV,1421579441,'Bitcoin Box' Can Process Payments With No Web Connection,"A prototype cryptocurrency point-of-sales (POS) terminal called Bitcoin Box can process transactions without the need for an Internet connection. Instead it relies on Near Field Communications (NFC) and Bluetooth to enable payments.  The device has been developed by Hive developer Jan Vornberger, who said the customer simply needs to touch their smartphone on the device and it completes the transaction via Bluetooth.  Bitcoin Box relies on off-the-shelf components to create a payment flow and was inspired by Apple Pay, he added.  Although Vornberger is relatively new to bitcoin hardware, he honed his skills working on a number of bitcoin software projects, including Hive Wallet, Instawallet and Bridgewalker. He is currently working on the Hive Android client.  Wallet-to-server transactions  Vornberger describes the Bitcoin Box as the first tailored bitcoin POS solution that combines NFC and Bluetooth to enable offline payments. The basic concept is similar to Andy Schroder’s Bitcoin Fluid Dispenser.  Vornberger explained the benefits of offline bitcoin transactions:  “So far, most bitcoin POS solutions rely on simply having the customer broadcast the bitcoin transaction over the bitcoin network. This can be unreliable, as sometimes the shop system does not see the transaction immediately, resulting in delays.”  However, using the BIP70 bitcoin payment protocol, the customer’s wallet can directly transmit the transaction to the merchant’s server.  BIP70 is currently supported by leading bitcoin payment processors BitPay and Coinbase, but Vornberger points out that those companies' implementations still require the customer to have an Internet connection.  “In many store locations, customer connectivity can be spotty. The Bitcoin Box therefore goes beyond BIP70 and allows the transmission of the bitcoin transaction not only over the Internet, but also via Bluetooth. This results in a very reliable payment process,” said Vornberger.  Bitcoin Box is compatible with all existing wallets and seamlessly upgrades to the improved BIP70 mechanism when available, he added.  No exotic hardware required  The Bitcoin Box is based on a Raspberry Pi board with a few extra off-the-shelf components and should be priced at $299 once it becomes available.  Vornberger indicated that the device is designed for low volume production, as the bitcoin merchant market is simply not big enough for custom hardware.  “There are very few hardware POS solutions for bitcoin. Coinkite's system is the only one that is commercially available at this point, as far as I know, but does not currently support NFC and is a good deal more expensive. XBTerminal had a hardware prototype at one point, but I don't know what the status of that project is.”  Vornberger explained that he would like to see his web-free method spread to other POS platforms. The first step, he said, would be to standardise the more cutting-edge features, like offline payments, in collaboration with the bitcoin developer community.  “Some proposals exist, but one goal of the Bitcoin Box is also to shake out problems and arrive at a solid solution, which can then hopefully flow back to other POS solutions,” said Vornberger.  Industry best practices  Vornberger noted that most bitcoin POS solutions are software-only, usually developed for Android devices.  He outlined a number of pros and cons associated with this approach:  “This is smart, as Android phones are cheap and ubiquitous, but also tends to drift towards a lowest common denominator situation, which often means [utilising] QR codes of a bitcoin address and listening for unreliable broadcasts on the bitcoin network. NFC especially is a weak point, as those devices either do not have it or the antenna is in some inconvenient place for a checkout situation.”  NFC antennas on Android devices are usually located at the back of the device, or in the battery cover on certain smartphones. Apple’s iPhone 6 features its antenna at the top of the device, making it more practical for payments.  While this may seem like a small drawback, Vorbnerger argues that the ""devil is in the detail"" when it comes to user experience.  This is why he felt the best approach was to create a reference design which implements all the best practices and industry standards, which can then be put together and showcased as a demonstration of how fast, reliable and convenient bitcoin payments can be.  BitPay, with its good infrastructure and supports for multiple standards, is Vornberger's payment processor of choice, he said, adding that he is still open to alternatives.  The plan is to focus on one payment processor for the launch, then consider adding support for additional processors at a later date.  The first store-ready products should ship within three to six months, Vornberger said, although that schedule might yet need to be extended.  So far, Vornberger has bootstrapped development of the Bitcoin Box with his own money, but he is currently looking for investment partners to bring the working proof-of-concept prototype to a production-ready state.

42377943,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LVqH,1421542169,TNABC Day 1: Bitcoin Industry Undeterred Despite Price Decline,"Taking place over eight hours at Miami Beach’s famed Fillmore Theater on Saturday, The North American Bitcoin Conference (TNABC) covered a range of topics dominating industry discussion, from security and commerce to development and regulation – notably rare in the discussion, however, was bitcoin’s turbulent price.  The topic was absent in most of the event's panel sessions, despite its prominent status in the most recent news cycle. In contrast to last year’s TNABC Miami, which was held when the price was over $800, bitcoin was trading at sub-$200 levels at press time, having fallen from near-$300 at the start of 2015.  Instead, speakers at this edition of TNABC appeared undeterred by this development and more focused on the work ahead. Less distracted by the initial rush of discovery on display in past conferences, most seemed more intent on solving specific pain points that could form stepping stones to the technology’s wider adoption.  This emphasis on pressing forward in the face of obstacles with a more pragmatic optimism was perhaps best summed up by Eric Larchevêque, CEO of bitcoin hardware wallet developer Ledger, who told CoinDesk:  “The price is not really an issue. We’re relying on the technology, the blockchain. Startups are going to continue to develop and bitcoin will go more mass market.”  The sentiment was echoed by AltMarket co-founder Bryce Weiner, who explained that he feels the event showcased how the industry is closer to consolidating its efforts.  “The direction that we’re headed in is a refinement of the message. We’ll see a significant investment in that narrative, in that message, and the unification of that message [in 2015],” Weiner said, emphasizing the role the media will play may not always be positive, and that this message might not always be inclusive to new ideas.  Lawrence Nahum, CEO of multisig startup GreenAddress, was more direct in his characterization of the visibly tempered enthusiasm of attendees.  “At [Bitcoin 2014], people were like ‘to the moon!’,” he said. “Here not so much.”  Still, a number of talks showcased that, despite a seemingly ever-increasing diversity of ideas, the bitcoin community is demonstrating that it can direct a concerted effort toward attacking problems.  Coinsetter fights credit card misconceptions  One of the day’s more passionate speakers, Coinsetter CEO Jaron Lukasiewicz portrayed a confidence and focus onstage while seeking to debunk the common industry mantra that bitcoin can compete against credit cards today.  “Credit cards pay people at 1.5%. Bitcoin costs the consumer 1.5%,” Lukasiewicz said. “That's the competition, and as an industry we need to be looking at where bitcoin competes.”  The topic may be an unexpected one for Lukasiewicz to address given that his exchange business largely aims to encourage market makers into the bitcoin ecosystem.  Rather than addressing Coinsetter, however, Lukasiewicz’s talk was geared broadly toward discussing what it takes to run a bitcoin company. He stressed that understanding the competition was key to this goal.  “We have the tendency to communicate that bitcoin is a cheaper solution [as a payment method], but you have to check into the consumer standpoint,” he cautioned.  Instead, he positioned cross-border payment processing as a use case with a stronger value proposition, a subject that came up frequently during the day’s proceedings.  Factom’s future taking shape  One of the more vibrant presentations of the day was by Factom creator and founder Paul Snow, whose often humorous talk focused on his project’s blockchain-based record-keeping network first proposed in a November white paper.  Snow’s talk focused on the big picture of Factom, one of the more ambitious crypto 2.0 projects launched so far in the space.  “Instead of looking at the blockchain as a form that has certain fields that can produce a certain type of transaction, I wanted to produce blank paper. Factom provides you the ability to get a blank paper, write on that paper and turn the page,” Snow explained.  The speech also saw notable announcements, including the release of the Factom consensus paper, the confirmation its crowdsale will be held on decentralized application marketplace Koinify and the presentation of an impressive example of the strength of its technology, storing the entire Project Gutenberg library on the bitcoin blockhain with two hashes.  The announcements suggest that even the more experimental ideas in the bitcoin space may be newly focused on delivering results.    @factomproject hashes the whole Project Gutenberg on the #bitcoin #blockchain with 2 hashes! http://t.co/kw33UXWvaY pic.twitter.com/VJTTOe4ZkF      — Nicola Minichiello (@colortwits) January 17, 2015      Star Xu’s US debut  The conference also saw the first US appearance of leading CNY/BTC exchange OKCoin’s CEO Star Xu, a talk that was aimed at dispelling myths about the Chinese market while also showcasing that the company is thinking big about the ways it can help push bitcoin forward in its market.  Xu put forth a clear message that OKCoin is seeking not just to appeal to traders, but to developers and mainstream consumers.  He explained how the target audience for its planned debit card product would be very specific – Chinese families whose children are studying abroad.  Overall, Xu focused on what he called “real acceptance”, a development he defined as one that would occur when bitcoin became a vehicle for more than just speculation.  “Let’s really use bitcoin, not just use bitcoin when we sell in an exchange. When more merchants support bitcoin, and the price becomes more stable, people are going to hold and use bitcoin,” Xu said.  However, Xu also faced questions from an audience that was mainly focused on the exchange’s role in global trading, tackling tough queries about his exchange’s support for margin trading and its potential impact on global bitcoin prices.  “I think margin helped bitcoin liquidity get to another level,” Xu countered. “Shorts and long make the market very stable.”  Chain highlights developer challenges  Of course, inspiring more mainstream adoption is easier said than done, and blockchain API developer Chain CTO Ryan Smith talked about the hurdles that are prohibiting developers from entering the space and engaging on platforms like OKCoin’s.  Smith noted that while bitcoin can be used in a variety of use cases today, from micropayments to remittances, the practical tools that developers will need to attack these goals are lacking.  “With Apple, there’s a library for everything I want to do, but when I come to bitcoin, those things aren’t there,” Smith said, illustrating one way that bitcoin lags behind when encouraging innovation on its platform.  He went to frame these building blocks as necessary in slides that emphasized how blockbuster Internet products such as Netflix, Lyft and Urban Dictionary rely on underlying tech support that allows them to focus on acquiring consumers.  “Only one person runs Urban Dictionary,” Smith said. “He doesn’t have to spend his time doing anything but picking the word of the day.”  The talk comes amid an uptick in interest from investors in bitcoin's underlying technology, with API maker BlockCypher most recently raising $3m from an impressive list of investors.  Startups vie for investor attention  Many of these familiar themes arose during the day’s Startup Stage, judged by angel investor Brock Pierce, SilkRoad Equity's Matthew Roszak, Pantera Capital's Steve Waterhouse and bitcoin developer Peter Todd.  Competing were a field of startups each trying to build the bitcoin ecosystem in new ways, including Latin America-focused exchange MexBT, white-label bitcoin processor CoinSimple, multi-currency wallet provider Casheer, crypto 2.0 platform Counterparty and bitcoin wallet security startup Rivetz.  While Counterparty and Casheer both put forth strong presentations and were cited by the judges in post-event remarks, it was perhaps Rivetz that commanded the most attention for its efforts to focus solely on secure online transactions through hardware device identity.  “Rivetz is a big idea that will change the game,” Roszak said after the presentations. Pierce, too, commended the project as one that could help advance bitcoin security at a time when the industry is still visibly struggling against this challenge.  The startup stage is set to continue in day two of TNABC, with Bitreserve, Virtual Bank, Airbitz, Augur, Ribbit and StorJ presenting.  Regulatory surprises  Ending the day were two segments on regulation that merged into one when Australian senator Sam Dastyari joined the previously planned regulation panel moderated by Perkins Coie’s Jacob Farber and featuring Chamber of Digital Commerce president Perianne Boring.  That event also illustrated how the bitcoin industry is moving forward to more concrete goals, featuring a discussion about which jurisdictions might enable bitcoin growth, while providing evidence that the struggles of the bitcoin industry may be far from over.  In particular, the panel discussed how bitcoin startups should continue to be mindful of how they fit under the law and in how they present their products to consumers.  Most notable, however, was the declaration by Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP's Marco Santori that 2015 will see the passage of the first statute relating to digital currency in the US, though he refused to divulge further details.  “Can we run down a list of states in alphabetical order?” Farber joked, in a sign that while industry growth moves forward, much about the bitcoin industry’s trajectory remains unknown.
