42399296,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiqrQ,1473284809,'Big Four' Accounting Firm Deloitte is Now Running a Bitcoin ATM,"'Big Four' accounting firm Deloitte is now the owner and operator of its first bitcoin ATM.  After a quiet unveiling yesterday in the downtown Toronto offices of Deloitte's Rubix blockchain division, the bitcoin transaction machine, or BTM, is now ready to exchange digital currency for Canadia dollars.  The move by Deloitte to host a bitcoin ATM is being positioned by the founder of Rubix as a way for the company to teach its employees and others in the area about blockchain by going back to its roots.  Now the strategy leader of Rubix by Deloitte, Iliana Oris Valiente, told CoinDesk:  ""We see this as being an important milestone for us as an organization. It's a move to improve accessibility and hands-on learning as first step toward greater blockchain adoption.""  The BTM was manufactured by Bitaccess, an Ottawa-based company, and it can accept up to 1,000 bills in multiple currencies.  Rubix by Deloitte is the accounting firm’s blockchain technology offering based in Canada, which works exclusively on enterprise blockchain applications with clients around the world.  A second chance  Initial enthusiasm around bitcoin ATMs in 2014 never really materialized, with a total of only about 775 bitcoin machines currently in operation around the world, according to CoinATMRadar.com.  But the symbolic power of the ""Big Four"" accounting firm partnering with Bitaccess isn’t lost on the bitcoin company’s founder, suggesting the devices may have a second life as educational tools and resources.  Bitaccess co-founder Moe Adham said in a statement:  ""It further advances our mission to commercialize blockchain technologies.""

42399301,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiqvM,1473282705,Exchange Group: EU Blockchain Rules Shouldn't Disrupt Financial Order,"A securities exchange trade organization has submitted a letter to the EU's top markets regulator that offers input on how it should regulate the use of blockchain.  The response, sent last week by the World Federation of Exchanges (WFE) to the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), comes more than a year after the agency began soliciting information from stakeholders on the technology.  The letter, which indicated overall support for the ESMA's involvement in the space, argues that the technology shouldn't fully replace the existence of third-parties in the market – an argument at odds with systems like bitcoin which are, at their heart, devoid of third parties.  The organization notes:  ""We believe that, while DLT can bring significant benefits to the industry, risks must nevertheless be managed carefully in order to ensure the concept of a trusted, neutral, third party will remain at the heart of well-functioning markets.""  A recent WFE survey found that a majority of the organization's members are in some stage of blockchain testing, however according to the letter, regulatory and legal issues remain a hindrance to development.  ""It is important to have certainty regarding the legal status of digitized assets as a means of transferring and granting security over interests in such assets as well as treatment in insolvency, and applicability of insolvency protection,"" the WFE continues.  The ESMA has received a number of submissions from various stakeholders in the past year, including Italian banking group Intesa Sanpaolo. Members of the blockchain industry, including nonprofit advocacy group Coin Center, have also weighed in during the process.

Startup TradeWind Markets, which recently spun off from The Investor's Exchange (IEX), is said to be preparing to launch the exchange in the coming months, according to Reuters. The firm aims to tap blockchain to increase the transparency of the gold exchange process, including the clearing and settling of trades.  With the news, TradeWind Markets joins companies such as Netagio, itBit and Euroclear as the latest to launch a project exploring the intersection of the gold market and blockchain tech.  Published in 2014, ""Flash Boys"" followed IEX's attempt to change what its founders perceived as a rigged stock market system favoring big Wall Street institutions.

42399286,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiqiZ,1473266286,BNP Paribas Opens Lab to Boost Productivity With Blockchain,"BNP Paribas has opened a new FinTech laboratory at its New York headquarters that will focus on building blockchain solutions to employee problems.  Revealed this morning at a blockchain hackathon held by the French multi-national bank, the 5,000 square foot Innovation Zone is on the 30th floor of BNP's offices, where 2,500 employees work. Eventually, the lab will house the work of six task forces, which will also work on AI and big data.  BNP's chief operating officer of commercial investment banking, Bruno d-Illiers, explained the vision for the project and why the lab is open to all his employees, not just cryptographers and traditional leadership.  D-Illiers told CoinDesk:  ""We don't believe that innovation is just for the senior executives. We want to engage each and every staff member.""  The inaugural hackathon  Today, the lab hosted its inaugural project, which saw five groups working to build blockchain proofs-of-concept over two days.  The winner, to be selected by a jury on Thursday, 8th September, will be granted additional support from BNP Paribas.  ""The objective is to do more,"" said d-Illier, who has worked with the bank for 15 years. ""To disseminate the information about what blockchain is about.""  To help connect those dots for the audience of 200, several leaders in the industry gathered to discuss the impact of blockchain on the financial sector, and the role community learning spaces can play in giving banks an advantage.  He continued:  ""Many people understand blockchain, but they don’t understand the impact it will have on our business model.""  Blockchain disconnection  After a brief introduction by d-Illier, the launch kicked off with a discussion with Microsoft's blockchain business strategist, Yorke Rhodes III, centered on the weaknesses in how early-stage proofs of concept are being built, and how future builders can avoid them.  Namely, Rhodes told the hackers that user interfaces tend to have little connection with real-world spreadsheets and other data sources that could better show how a distributed ledger could lead to unanticipated efficiencies.  Rhodes works with Microsoft's clients looking to build with their suite of tools hosted by its Project Bletchley.  Going forward, Rhodes said his clients and the technologists working at BNP Paribas will need to get over trying to prove that the technology works and build practical user interfaces.  ""No end user should ever know they’re using the blockchain,"" said Rhodes. ""When you think about it, don’t think of the tech, thtink what am I doing that’s hard and how can I make it better using a distributed ledger?""  Hacker advice  Next, BNP's head of commodities in the Americas, Catherine Flax, who also sits on the board of blockchain startup Digital Asset Holdings (DAH), moderated a panel with industry experts.  On the panel were DAH chief marketing officer Dan O’Prey, R3CEV’s co-founder, Todd McDonald and blockchain investor, Pascal Bouvier, who spoke about the business applications of blockchain, culminating in advice to the hackers.  Aligning with the rest of the tone of the event, the panelists all advised the developers not to get distracted by what the technology can do, but focus on the actual problems they confront in their day-to-day jobs.  ""Bring your problems,"" said McDonald, who is also R3CEV’s chief operating officer. ""Don’t be tethered with the hype of what blockchains can or can’t do. Catalogue the different problems you face then go from there.""  While all the panelists had advice for the hackers, investor Pascal Bouvier, who worked at BNP Paribas early in his career, spoke a bit more specifically about what exactly interested him as a potential investment.  He said:  ""Find and develop a solution around the provisioning of an identification, whether that’s an individual ID or a corporate ID. I know of at least one investor who would be interested.""

42399300,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiquN,1473260754,Smart Contract Analyzer to Debut at Ethereum Conference,"Researchers from National University of Singapore will soon release a tool that will help ethereum users determine whether the smart contracts they've coded are valid or not.  Developed in the wake of the massive hack of the first large-scale smart contract – The DAO – in June, the researchers described the tool as an attempt to curb future problems that could lead consumer funds to be lost. Called Oyente, the program has been reportedly used to successfully pinpoint bugs in thousands of smart contracts, including the one that led to the failure of The DAO.  National University of Singapore PhD student Loi Luu explained that the team first began its work by analyzing smart contracts for security bugs.  Luu told CoinDesk:  ""After finding all these problems, we wanted to measure how many smart contracts have these problems.""  Oyente, he said, represents a refinement and optimization of this process, one that analyzes security problems in which adversaries could manipulate smart contracts for gains.  Luu's team now plans to release the code for the smart contract analyzer before Devcon2, the ethereum development conference set to be held later this month in Shanghai.  The open-source analyzer is among the many new ideas to enhance smart contract security on the public ethereum blockchain, but innovation has also been forced to other blockchains.  For example, the failure of The DAO can be seen as encouraging a new emphasis on innovation at the smart contracting language level due to criticisms with Solidity, ethereum's specially designed smart contract programming language.  Automating bug detection  Before release, the team is working with ethereum developers and to clean up the Oyente code and write documentation for developers that will illustrate its benefits.  There are four key problems that the tool can detect, including the ""reentrancy"" bug, or the type of bug that led to The DAO collapse.  To analyze a smart contract, a user feeds it into the Oyente program, which will then notify them if it has vulnerabilities that malicious actors can potentially exploit.  Oyente aims to go through every possible path of the program to check for these bugs, Luu explained:  ""If there are two possible execution paths, it will go through each of them and check whether the reentrancy bug happens in that path, and then flag whether the smart contract is vulnerable or not.""  Specifically, Oyente looks at the smart contract ""bytecode"" or the code that's ultimately stored on the blockchain.  Before use, high-level ethereum programming languages like Solidity or Serpent are converted into bytecode so that the ethereum network can understand and execute them.  For more details on the project, read the full white paper.  Update: The headline has been updated to better reflect the performance of the Oyente tool.

42399291,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiqnU,1473256598,BNY Mellon is Backing Up Bank Transactions With Blockchain Tech,"BNY Mellon has developed a test system that leverages blockchain technology to create a backup record of its brokerage transactions.  The new system, which operates alongside BNY's existing transaction records system, aims to provide an operational buffer in the event that the first layer of transaction records becomes unavailable.  Dubbed 'BDS 360', the resiliency solution was developed as part of the bank's broader blockchain efforts, which have seen it initiate internal projects as well as collaborate with financial institutions as part of the R3 distributed ledger consortium and the recently announced ""settlement coin"" project.  Yet BNY's trial suggests institutions, perhaps uneasy about switching wholesale to a new kind of infrastructure, may want to test the waters by running blockchain solutions in the background, thus providing an avenue for gathering data and experience with the technology.  BNY CIO Suresh Kumar framed the effort as a way for the bank to test ""the strengths and weaknesses"" of the technology, echoing comments made earlier this year. At the time, Kumar described the technology as ""a huge opportunity"".  The CIO also suggested that the bank is seeking avenues for experimenting with blockchain in ways that don't require coordination between other financial institutions.  He told CoinDesk:  ""Assume your primary system is down. Do you have the information that you need so that you are able to conduct business, have an account for transactions that you know of, so that you can settle transactions? So that’s what we tried to do.""  Cost-efficient resiliency  One major selling point for the system, according to Kumar, was the ability to stand it up in a short period of time at a relatively low cost.  ""The way we have made these systems resilient is very expensive, and it takes a long time to make it resilient. This [system] allows us to improve the resiliency in a relatively short period of time with a relatively [small] group of people,"" he explained.  That question of resiliency was invoked in a recent MIT paper on the technology, which posited that a bank integration of blockchain could improve overall resiliency by decentralizing risk points, thereby reducing the possibility of data loss when doing business.  It was this idea that Kumar repeatedly cited resin interview, discussing the shift from more complicated resiliency systems to more streamlined, simplified ones, which also provide a wholly new approach to the task.  ""To me, the idea that you can have a distributed ledger that can give you what you need if your primary system is down and continue conducting business is a pretty awesome thing,"" he said.  Next steps  According to Kumar, the next phase of testing will revolve around the continued operation of the system, while at the same time slowly introducing some of the bank's customers to the concept.  While BNY executives have discussed their client-side blockchain work in the past, Kumar indicated that it was still very much a learning process, one that allowed the bank to gain more insights into how it can leverage blockchains for its own purposes. How clients would be integrated into the system is also up for debate, including the kinds of hardware and software that would be needed as part of this process.  Kumar went on to suggest that, if successful, the system could provide the basis for new ways of doing business (and making money).  It's an experiment that could set BNY Mellon up as a kind of ""resiliency provider"", utilizing blockchain tech as an efficient mechanism for backing up sensitive transactions.  ""We used it internally for ourselves. Now we are thinking, can [we] do this in a generic way, for other systems?"" he explained, adding:  ""We are trying to think, how do we roll this out?""

Barclays  reported today that two partners (agriculture co-operative Ornua and food product distributor Seychelles Trading Company) were able to successfully transfer trade documentation via a blockchain platform created by its accelerator program graduate, Wave.  The Israel-based startup graduated from the TechStars FinTech accelerator last fall, at the time indicating it was using custom technology on top of a blockchain to facilitate the transfer of trade documents.  In statements, Barclays head of trade and working capital Baihas Baghdadi said the project confirms that adding multiple parties to a distributed ledger system can remove one of the biggest ""headaches"" associated with global trade, the movement of the paper documents that track and authenticate the transactions.  Baghdadi said:  ""That is why we’ve been very keen to partner with Wave in using blockchain technology to save time and money for our clients, and potentially transform trade finance for businesses around the world.""  The announcement follows news that a number of major banks are testing applications of blockchain in the global supply chain.  In August alone, banking consortium R3CEV revealed 15 of its members had participated in a trade finance trial, while Bank of America and HSBC reportedly embarked on a similar effort.

42399284,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiqed,1473249315,Hong Kong's Central Bank to Test Blockchain,"Hong Kong's de-facto central bank intends to launch an innovation hub that will test blockchain and distributed ledger solutions.  The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) revealed yesterday it has begun work on the initiative with the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute (ASTRI), an initiative founded by the government to enhance its competitiveness in technology.  In statements, the HKMA said it sees the innovation hub as playing a role as a ""neutral ground"" for the testing of financial technology prior to its eventual release.  The announcement coincided with formal comments from HKMA chief executive Norman Chan, who in a speech at Treasury Market Summit 2016 sought to dispel the idea the autonomous territory was not moving quickly enough to embrace FinTech innovation.  Chan said:  ""There is also a quite commonly-held perception that the development of Fintech in the financial services sector in Hong Kong has been slow. I do not subscribe to this view, at least insofar as the banking sector is concerned.""  Additional activities that are expected to take place at the innovation hub include the testing of solutions that require substantial computing resources; discussions between regulators, incumbents and startups; and the testing of solutions that could be adopted by the HKMA.  With the details of how resources should be allocated for the effort still being ""prioritized"", more updates on the project are expected in the coming weeks.
