42400247,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJBOx,1503001509,Bitcoin Cash Breaks Price Doldrums to Push Past $400,"Bitcoin Cash's price rose above the $400 mark today, breaking the rangebound market trend of the past several days.  The cryptocurrency climbed as high as $406 today, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The move followed days of steady market fluctuations, with the price of Bitcoin Cash trading no more than a few dollars above or below the $300 level.  The largest Bitcoin Cash market by-volume is Bithumb, which accounts for roughly 30 percent of the global trade through its Korean won-Bitcoin Cash trading pair, CoinMarketCap figures show. The exchange reports more than $145 million in volume over the past 24 hours.  At press time, Bitcoin Cash is trading at about $391 on Bithumb.  As previously reported by CoinDesk, Bitcoin Cash split off from the main bitcoin blockchain earlier this month when a group of miners and developers moved to adopt software, with new network rules, that was incompatible with the rest of the network. The result: bitcoin ""forked"" into two distinct blockchains with their own freely-traded digital assets.  Today's upward price action comes just hours after bitcoin reached a new all-time high above $4,500.

42400253,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJBSt,1502996417,"Bitcoin Bear Peter Schiff Doubles Down: Even at $4,000 It's Still a 'Bubble'","The price of bitcoin continues to surge, defying critics to set a new all-time high of $4,500 today.  But even though bitcoin's price has soared in recent weeks, there will always be bears who see the market through a profoundly darker lens. One of the best-known among the bears, investor Peter Schiff, is now making his case in even stronger terms for why bitcoin has advanced ever farther into bubble territory.  Schiff, who predicted the 2008 mortgage crisis, famously referred to bitcoin as digital fool's gold and compared the cryptocurrency to the infamous bubble in Beanie Babies.  Moreover, the recent run-up in bitcoin hasn't softened Schiff's view: If anything, it's reinforced his sense of impending doom.  Schiff told CoinDesk:  ""There's certainly a lot of bullishness about bitcoin and cryptocurrency, and that's the case with bubbles in general. The psychology of bubbles fuels it. You just become more convinced that it's going to work. And the higher the price goes, the more convinced you become that you're right. But it's not going up because it's going to work. It's going up because of speculation.""  In other words, bitcoin’s upward momentum ­– even the price more than doubling within 90 days ­– may be a kind of self-fulfilling pipe dream.  Schiff does acknowledge that, under certain circumstances, bubbles can lead to trading opportunities for investors who aren’t wedded to the long-term viability of the asset.  ""People who get in and get out can make money,"" he said. Unfortunately, that's easier said than done. He added: ""Most people never get out. Most people just don't sell, because of the psychology, and what happens to most people is they just keep buying more. So, when it crashes, they don’t just give back the paper profits – they give back real money.""  In a wide-ranging conversation with CoinDesk, Schiff sketched out why he's still okay leaving money on the table when it comes to the crypto asset class.  'Bitcoin ain't money'  The most fundamental of Schiff's arguments can be summed up in one quote: ""What it comes down to is that bitcoin ain't money.""  Schiff, who is both a passionate advocate and long-time investor in gold, has a narrow definition of money. Simply stated: ""Money must be a commodity,"" he said.  While Schiff is clearly an advocate for the inherent value of gold, he acknowledges a role for fiat currency in the modern economy.  According to Schiff, government-issued money works because there are other valuable things people can do with money. All of the following , for example, are true of fiat currency: you can pay taxes using fiat money; you can buy insurance denominated in dollars; you can buy bonds denominated in dollars, which will pay you interest in dollars.  In Schiff's view, based on this use case, ""People have jumped to the conclusion: Since dollars have no intrinsic value, they jump to the notion that cryptocurrencies can work. Two wrongs don't make a right.""  Based on this interpretation, Schiff doesn't believe bitcoin can fulfill those functions.  Regulation looming  In Schiff's telling, the nefarious uses of bitcoin are one of the primary reasons why regulators are going to go after operators in its market.  ""The main benefit of bitcoin – the only segment of society where it's used for something other than speculation – is crime,"" he said, noting that when cybercriminals hijack computer systems they very often demand their ransom in bitcoin.  While Schiff acknowledges that early adopters of bitcoin have legitimately used it to purchase legal goods and services, he still believes its association with criminal activity is a net negative.  Schiff also points to the risks of future regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), who recently weighed in on the DAO, calling its sale of DAO tokens equivalent to the sale of unregistered securities. If the broad strokes of that report were imposed on the industry as a whole, the large segments initial coin offering (ICO) market might quickly withdraw.  What makes bitcoin different?  While Schiff expressed skepticism about cryptocurrency, he's bullish on the long-term potential of blockchain technology more broadly.  But he does pose an interesting question about the long-term use case for bitcoin.  ""Even if you believe that cryptocurrency is going to work, how do you know that 10 years from now bitcoin is going to be the one? If digital currencies can work, someone can come up with another one. And another one. And another. And another. There's nothing special about bitcoin that another cryptocurrency can't replicate and improve on. Right now, bitcoin is just the most popular because it was first,"" he said.  Schiff also noted that owners of bitcoin only have claims on the value of the currency itself, and don't own a share of the process.  In this sense, owning bitcoin is roughly analogous to owning a single product made by a company, rather than owning the company's stock, which represents a claim on corporate ownership. (If you own a share of Apple, you own a claim on the cash from future products, not just a portion of one model of iPhone.)  Schiff alludes to a kind of innovators dilemma: Very often, companies that are first into a market, or are the most impressive early innovator in a space, are not the ones that are ultimately most successful.  Or, as Schiff frames the problem: ""How do we know that someone isn't going to come around and do to Facebook what Facebook did to Myspace?""  If you extend Schiff's metaphor to the cryptocurrency space, the implications are clear: What if the experience that the cryptocurrency world gains from bitcoin is leveraged in creating a newer, shinier cryptocurrency in the future?  The downside  When asked to sum up, Schiff was unequivocal:  ""This is a speculative frenzy. Right now, this is a bubble. It's a cult. When you're in it, obviously you need more people to believe in it, because the price can only go up if other people buy in. In that sense it's a natural Ponzi scheme – a lot of it is just plain greed.""  Those are very tough words for any investor in bitcoin to hear -- and ones they've heard from both inside and outside the market before.  So what's Schiff's advice to investors?  Mostly, Schiff urges investors in bitcoin who have seen outsized gains to take some profits: ""If you think you're smart, don't be afraid to take 10% off the table. Don't be afraid to sell into the rally. Don't get greedy. Don't lose all your money.""  While it may be disappointing to members of the cryptocurrency community to hear such criticisms, Schiff said he's still ""very sympathetic"" to the idea of a free market alternative to fiat currencies, and would very much like to see something that can compete with the US dollar and the Yen as a reserve currency.  ""Libertarian-minded crypto fans saw this was a way to liberate people from the government,"" he said, concluding:  ""I think it will have the opposite effect. People are going to lose money. This could really backfire, giving libertarian ideals a bad name by making fiat look good. The downside can be really spectacular.""

42400259,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJBWp,1502993122,Decentralized Exchange Protocol 0x Raises $24 Million in ICO,"The team behind the decentralized exchange protocol 0x has raised $24 million in an initial coin offering (ICO).  As previously reported by CoinDesk, 0x aims to provide an exchange layer for ethereum-based tokens under the ERC20 standard. An early-stage version of the software was released in May, with the idea being that users can exchange tokens directly between one another – similar to how over-the-counter markets function – rather than going through an exchange service.  The token sale took place between August 15 and 16, collecting the $24 million worth of ether – the cryptocurrency of the ethereum network – from a group of 12,000 backers, according to the 0x team.  The project itself drew support from a group of venture capitalist firms including Polychain Capital, Blockchain Capital and Pantera Capital, along with Chinese investment firms Jen Advisors and FBG Capital, all of whom contributed in exchange for discounted tokens during the sale.  The fundraise represents the latest conducted through the ICO model. It's one that has attracted interest in the startup world, as well as those who are positioning themselves to regulate activities in the space, including the US Securities and Exchange Commission.  According to data from CoinDesk's ICO Tracker, nearly $1.8 billion has been invested via token sales to date. Of that amount, more than $500 million was raised in July alone.

42400262,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJBal,1502989228,Xerox Patent Applications Reveal Plan for Blockchain Records System,"Technology giant Xerox wants to patent a way to securely revise electronic documents using blockchain, public records show.  The company – perhaps best known for its eponymous copying machines – filed a pair of applications in February 2016, according to new records released by the US Patent and Trademark Office. The concept laid out in the applications envisions a network of nodes – all of which can share data via a blockchain – are creating and updating documentary records.  As for who might use the proposed system, Xerox suggests ""regional hospital systems or multi-national corporations"" might find it applicable to their needs.  One of the applications explain:  ""In one embodiment, the auditing system uses an encryption process, such as public key cryptography, to sign all record changes in an electronic document (with the private half of a key pair) and to verify that records have not been altered (with the public half of the key pair). This is important in ensuring the security of record changes before they are fixed in the blockchain. The security of the disclosed system and method may improve as the system becomes larger.""  Notably, it's that first use case – healthcare – that Xerox has honed in on in the relatively few statements the firm has made on blockchain to date.  In a blog post published late last month, Ritesh Gandotra, director of global document outsourcing for Xerox India pointed to the tech as a potential platform for storing and exchange electronic health records.  ""The current need of the industry is a solution that is not only innovative but also decentralised — a record management system that handles [electronic health records] using blockchain technology,"" she wrote.

42400268,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJBfg,1502985579,Bitcoin's Biggest Software Wallet Blockchain Adds Ethereum,"Bitcoin wallet startup Blockchain is today launching an option for users to create ethereum software wallets, a move that marks the first time the startup has integrated a new cryptocurrency since it launched in 2011.  Announced today, the launch also coincides with a new partnership with cryptocurrency exchange service ShapeShift that will enable users to transition funds between their bitcoin and ethereum wallets, without first needing to send funds to a centralized service.  But while Blockchain executives largely kept the focus on how this would enable retail users to continue to experiment with cryptocurrencies, in comments, they also hinted at the possible business applications that could be available should the service.  CEO Peter Smith said in a statement:  ""As popularity of ethereum has grown, so has the desire from our customers to have the option to manage multiple digital assets within their blockchain wallets. We are thrilled to introduce this new functionality to our community and will continue to find ways to make interacting with digital assets even easier.""  Elsewhere, the company said it is open to offering other services to ethereum users, hinting its data tools could soon see an overhaul. Also mentioned was the possibility that a software wallet could be available to business users.  The company said its release today is not designed for developers or companies.  Nonetheless, such advancements could be propelled forward by new funding. Blockchain recently raised $40 million in a Series B funding round, drawing from a group of investors that included billionaire Richard Branson. The startup has raised more than $70 million to date in venture funding, according to CoinDesk data.  More broadly, it's also the latest sign bitcoin businesses are now adapting their business models to support multiple blockchains.  Other services have moved to integrate ether in recent days, including cryptocurrency exchange Bitstamp and Falcon Private Bank, a Swiss-based private bank that added support for ether just over a month after it first began offering bitcoin services.

42400266,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJBdi,1502974750,Lightning Bank Ledgers? Bitfury and Ripple Demo New Twist on Bitcoin Tech,"Bitcoin's much-anticipated Lightning Network is now compatible with seven different payment networks.  Today, blockchain services firm Bitfury and payments network provider Ripple are releasing new code that makes it possible to conduct Lightning-style transactions across a range of both blockchain and legacy payment networks. While still in its early stages of deployment, it's believed the Lightning Network could one day expand bitcoin's capacity to millions of transactions by moving those transactions off of the main bitcoin blockchain.  However, today's news arguably goes a step further, adding weight to the idea that the top-layer payments network isn't just a tool for bitcoin.  The two companies released a demo showcasing how the new technology can be used to make a transaction between bitcoin and litecoin, the two blockchain networks which have arguably made the most progress in developing the Lightning Network.  Since Lightning is increasingly perceived as a necessary layer for blockchain transactions, the companies view this as a big step toward a future where users won't have to worry about which payment method they're using.  Ripple CTO Stefan Thomas told CoinDesk:  ""I shouldn't have to care which particular coin you use or like. If you're on PayPal and I'm on Alipay or if I'm on bitcoin and you're using a bank account, I'll still be able to send you money and not worry about it. That's the long-term goal.""  Interledger addition  Honing in on Ripple and Bitfury's work more specifically, the companies have released code that integrates the Lightning Network with Interledger, a protocol designed by Ripple for making transactions between different types of blockchains.  This means it's compatible not only with public blockchains like bitcoin or ethereum, but with permissioned protocols managed by only a few companies, as well as traditional payment methods such as PayPal. Interledger aims to support transactions between all of these services by offering a type of ""payment-agnostic"" escrow service.  The W3C initiative made its first successful transaction across these various types of payment methods earlier this summer, but the new part here is that the Lightning Network can now sit on top of this infrastructure.  ""Lightning natively supports transactions across different blockchains, but it cannot make transactions to any central ledger or to PayPal. That's why integration of Interledger is very, very useful for Lightning,"" said Bitfury researcher Viacheslav Zhygulin.  Because litecoin and bitcoin already support test versions of the Lightning Network, the group successfully tested transactions using the LND Lightning Network implementation from Lightning Labs. (And, you can try it out using the open-source software, too.)  Right now, it only works on the ""testnet,"" a sandbox version of the blockchain used to trial new features and applications, but Thomas said that the functionality will work similarly on mainnet (the live bitcoin network) once it's safe to deploy it there.  In the process of developing the product, the two companies also developed a different testnet – what Thomas called a ""permanent testnet for testnets"" – that cuts across different blockchains as well.  Missing ingredients  Still, while the technology has now been released, there's work to be done to make the technology usable. For example, there are currently no Lightning Network implementations deployed on top of permissioned blockchains that could take advantage of this newfound interoperability.  Bitfury representatives argued, though, that the framework sets up the necessary infrastructure for the future.  Additionally, Thomas noted that future success of the protocol depends on how many clients ultimately choose to adopt Interledger and Lightning Network technology.  Still, the two companies described it as a big step towards moving money across different types of payment networks. And, since bitcoin and litecoin have near-completed Lightning Networks to work on the mainnet, it might not be long before users make real transactions between the two.  Longer-term, Thomas indicated that the goal is to move beyond the payment networks that Interledger currently supports to encompass perhaps all of them.  He concluded:  ""After being involved in the community for so long, I've found that the missing ingredient – the one thing that's missing – is interoperability. Not just with the blockchain, but with central ledgers and more generally interoperability in the financial system.""

Two former Coinbase engineers – James Hudon, who now works for Uber, and Andrew Alness, currently employed at Keybase – are listed as inventors.  At its heart, the patent concept relates to a method for storing and utilizing bitcoin private keys. Coinbase has filed other patents in the past related to private key security.  As the patent document explains:  ""A key ceremony application creates bundles for custodians encrypted with their passphrases. Each bundle includes master key share. The master key shares are combined to store an operational master key. The operational master key is used for private key encryption during a checkout process. The operational private key is used for private key decryption for transaction signing in a payment process. The bundles further include TLS keys for authenticated requests to create an API key for a web application to communicate with a service and to unfreeze the system after it has been frozen by an administrator.""

In a statement this morning, the Ministry of Justice announced that the legislation would seek to bring exchanges within the jurisdiction of the Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC), the country's chief financial intelligence office.  The effort dates back to mid-2016, when the government released a broad-ranging statement on financial technologies.  As the government explained today:  ""The bill will ... close a regulatory gap by bringing digital currency exchange providers under the remit of AUSTRAC; strengthen AUSTRAC's investigation and enforcement powers; increase police and customs officers' search and seizure powers at the border; and provide regulatory relief to industry through the deregulation of low-risk industry sectors.""

At the time, the Attorney-General's Department's indicated its support for such a move, calling for existing statutes to receive a legislative update.  It remains to be seen whether the measure – for which a release date has not been revealed – will face opposition once lawmakers begin debating it. As reported by CoinDesk, at least a few legislators in Australia want to see bitcoin named an official currency, indicating that at least some may push back against the AML effort.

Since then, users have been able to spend the cryptocurrency in exchange for service credits – but payments required a cumbersome manual approval process.  Now, ProtonMail is making bitcoin official and has developed an automated system to facilitate payments, according to a blog post.

In a blog post to be issued today, the Zcash Foundation intends to outline how the grants will be used to fund ""novel, underserved ideas"" in software development, science and research and community outreach. It is not, however, looking to fund projects that can be ""obviously monetized,"" such as startups seeking venture funding.  Project ideas  put forth by the foundation itself range from the technical, such as building software that will allow users to send zcash over the social messaging app WhatsApp, to the educational, like launching a meetup focused on the cryptocurrency.  Zcash Foundation senior program manager Josh Cincinnati told CoinDesk:  ""By providing these grant opportunities, we hope to spark creative ideas and encourage broader community participation... and build community infrastructure in the process. To borrow some analogies from the Zcash roadmap, ideally these grants will be seeds for the future of Zcash–and the broader privacy-focused crypotcurrency community.""  To apply, grant proposals must be submitted on GitHub by September 15, at which point they will considered by a notable group of reviewers, including cryptographer and University of Luxembourg professor Alex Biryukov and Ethereum Foundation researcher Vlad Zamfir.  Launched late last year, zcash is touted as a privacy-oriented cryptocurrency protocol in that it allows users the option to transact more anonymously using a bleeding-edge cryptography technique called zk-SNARKS.  Though it has not enjoyed quite as much attention since its splashy launch last October, development has continued behind the scenes. Zcash is currently working on a big software upgrade, called Sapling, with more updates expected in the coming months.

42400252,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJBQv,1502942424,ASX Calls for Review of Distributed Ledger Settlement Platform,"The Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) will soon have to decide if it's going to become the first global stock exchange with a distributed ledger settlement system, or if it will pursue a more traditional upgrade.  As revealed in an analyst and media briefing just hours ago, while progress toward a self-imposed December deadline for that very decision is still on schedule, considerations remain. Before adopting a distributed ledger system, deputy CEO Peter Hiom said ASX now intends to commission a review of the technology, ""in particular the cryptographic features of the platform.""  Speaking during a review of the exchange's financial results for fiscal year 2017, Hiom said information from tests by an unnamed third party would be used to determine if blockchain technology is ready for one of the largest exchanges in the world.  He said:  ""This is necessary to enable us to test the capability of the solution to meet enterprise grade business and technical requirements regarding scalability, speed, persistence and security.""  The update is the latest in a long line that have occurred since January 2016, when ASX first began working with portfolio firm Digital Asset Holdings to see if its distributed ledger platform could meet the the exchange’s equities settlement demands.  Among the desired features listed by Hiom and ASX CEO Dominic Stevens are reduced costs, as well as the creation of new, more easily replicable products, some of which appear to be largely contingent on data created by moving transactions to a shared, distributed ledger.  Hiom called the progress on these measures ""satisfactory"" during last night’s address, while Stevens described the work as providing possible future value for the exchange.  ""The more we investigate, the more we see potential for the technology across a wide range of applications,"" he said.  Contingency plans  If ASX does choose Digital Asset's technology, a scope for the new system is expected to be available for ""market consultation"" by March of next year – but that is far from guaranteed.  While Stevens refrained from saying there were other options options being actively considered, in response to a question from the audience, he added that if Digital Asset's technology wasn't deemed suitable, the exchange was open to other more traditional solutions.  ""We would move to what we would call a more classic answer of software providers that can provide services that could provide clearing,"" said Stevens, before adding that the technology looks ""promising.""  He concluded:  ""If we don’t go down that path then there will be another path to go down and we’ll have a very, very rich book of information.""
