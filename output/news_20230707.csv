14633601,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=541734,1688770839,"Analysts Puts Bitcoin At $125,000 By 2024, How Is This Possible?","Matrixport, a crypto financial services platform, has always been bullish on Bitcoin, especially in 2023. So its latest prediction for the digital asset comes as no surprise to investors. This time around, Matrixport analysts have predicted that the price of BTC will push forward to as high as $125,000 by the end of 2024. A 310% Increase For Bitcoin? The current forecast by Matrixport analysts for Bitcoin will see the cryptocurrency rally as high as 310% if it does come to pass. This prediction, however, was not just thrown around without expected catalysts that would trigger such a rally, which is outlined in the report. Related Reading: Rapid Rise In Cardano’s TVL Points Toward Bullish Sentiment Around ADA For BTC to reach as high as $125,000 by the end of 2024, Matrixport expects that the potential approval of the Bitcoin Spot ETFs filed by investing giants such as BlackRock and Fidelity Investments, among others, could be the push it needs. 2024 is important for these Bitcoin Spot ETF filings because the final date for a decision from the United States Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC) is in 2024. This is because the SEC gets three opportunities to postpone its decision, which it likely will. So a decision on whether or not investors will be able to trade a Spot BTC ETF is expected in February 2024 at the latest, as outlined in this Bitcoinist report. “With the potential approval of the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF and other institutional providers, the demand for Bitcoin could continue to support prices into our $45,000 year-end target,” Matrixport says in the report. “There is no obvious indication of what will drive the next bull market, but the data indicates that Bitcoin could continue to rally into the 2024 halving.” BTC Multiple Bullish Catalysts For BTC In 2024 As Matrixport mentions in its report, the Bitcoin Spot ETF filings are not the only bullish events that could drive a bull market in 2024. Another important event is the BTC halving event which is less than a year away now. This event will see the block rewards for the blockchain cut down in half from 6.25 BTC per mined block to 3.125 BTC per mined block. Next BTC halving is less than a year away | Source: Binance This decrease in the rate at which new BTC is being brought into circulation, coupled with the fact that the digital asset possesses a very limited supply, has always triggered each bull market. So even if expectations for the Spot ETFs do not play out and the SEC does reject the filings, it will likely only be a short-lived bearish momentum as the halving will take place only a few months after. Related Reading: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink Says Bitcoin Is Digital Gold, So What’s The Digital Silver? Going by historical performance, the BTC price has been known to rise more than 100% as expectations around the halving event grow. Given this, it is possible that BTC does reach a price of $125,000 by the end of 2024, according to the Matrixport report.

Ripple Advocates For Encouraging CBDC Ecosystem Development Friedman noted that Ripple’s goal is to advocate for global policy frameworks that encourage ecosystem development for crypto assets, including CBDCs. She expressed excitement for what is happening in the UK, as London and the government have taken a proactive approach to fintech and CBDCs. She cited the work of the Bank of England with the digital pound and the government’s consideration of all viewpoints when implementing a CBDC. According to Friedman, digital currencies and CBDCs are a natural evolution of how individuals and countries exchange value, given that current currencies were created in a less globalized world. Related Reading: Ethereum Address Creation Spikes, Adoption On The Rise? She also believes CBDCs can offer the same protection as fiat and that most countries looking to implement CBDCs are exploring CBDs to solve specific domestic challenges. Ultimately, she believes all countries must develop a strategy to implement CBDCs to efficiently interact with the global market. Ripple’s head of policy also sees CBDCs and cryptocurrencies as encouraging financial inclusion, increasing access to financial services for under and unbanked populations, and increasing the speed and efficiency of payments. She believes that digital currencies can also help reduce energy use and environmental resources by reducing the printing of paper money and minting coins. However, Friedman acknowledged that central banks globally are struggling to encourage this technology while maintaining financial stability and control of their monetary systems. She believes that there can be interoperability between these currencies in a way that maintains financial stability for all countries. In conclusion, Friedman’s positive outlook on London’s potential as a crypto hub reflects Ripple’s dedication to advocating for global policy frameworks that encourage ecosystem development for crypto assets and CBDCs. Her insights into the comparable security and protections of CBDCs and their potential to encourage financial inclusion and reduce energy use highlight the benefits of this technology. As countries worldwide explore the implementation of CBDCs, interoperability and maintaining financial stability will be critical factors to consider. XRP Enters Crucial Phase Market analyst Egrag Crypto has shared his insights on the next 100 days for XRP, highlighting key levels of support and resistance for investors to watch. As the market enters the third quarter of 2023, he believes this will be a make-it-or-break-it phase for XRP, with the potential for significant price movements. According to Egrag Crypto, XRP’s support levels are currently at $0.4570, $0.4250, and $0.4200, with major support at $0.3850. On the other hand, the resistance levels for XRP are currently locked at $0.48 and $0.50, with major resistance at $0.54 and $0.58. These levels may provide investors with an indication of where XRP’s price may move in the coming months. Related Reading: Surging Demand For Bitcoin Ordinals Propels Q2 Trading Volume To $210M However, Egrag Crypto also notes that the ongoing legal proceedings between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding XRP’s status as a security could significantly impact the cryptocurrency’s price. The decision by Judge Torres could sling-shot the price of XRP in either direction, depending on the verdict and subsequent actions. Despite this uncertainty, Egrag Crypto advises investors to stay level-headed and maintain a long-term perspective. Short-term volatility can be unpredictable, and emotions can run high. He recommends continuing with a dollar-cost averaging (DCA) strategy, as he believes in the potential of XRP and utility in the evolving digital economy.

The regulator filed its response to a Coinbase filing which argued that the agency does not have sufficient jurisdiction to bring a lawsuit against it. The SEC sued Coinbase a month ago, alleging it was operating as an unregistered broker, clearinghouse and exchange all in one go, having listed at least 13 different cryptocurrencies that are unregistered securities. In Friday's document, the SEC said that it would oppose any motion for judgment Coinbase might file, and asked a court to strike Coinbase's arguments that the suit violated the major questions doctrine and other concerns.  ""Coinbase, a multi-billion-dollar entity advised by sophisticated legal counsel, argues it was unaware that its conduct risked violating the federal securities laws, and suggests that by approving Coinbase’s registration statement in 2021 the SEC confirmed the legality of Coinbase’s underlying business activities – at that time and for all time,"" the SEC said in its filing.  However, the regulator continued, Coinbase had previously ""adopted the very legal framework"" enacted by the U.S. Supreme Court to determine whether certain cryptocurrencies met the requirements of federal securities laws, while ""explicitly discourag[ing]"" crypto issuers from making any statements ""traditionally associated with securities.""  Read more: SEC Has No Jurisdiction Over Cryptos on Coinbase, Exchange Says in Lawsuit Response  Coinbase's own public filings also note that one potential risk to Coinbase investors include the fact that listed assets might be considered securities.  ""These actions clearly show that Coinbase understood that the securities laws could apply to its conduct and knew which rules to consider in evaluating the legality of its conduct, but nevertheless made the calculated decision to take on this risk in the name of growing its business,"" the filing said.  The SEC also previewed its arguments pushing back against Coinbase's proposed motion for judgement, saying the crypto exchange made two ""equally flawed arguments.""  The first argument Coinbase made was saying an investment contract must include a formal contract, while the second said investment contracts are only asset sales if they're being traded on secondary markets.  The Howey Test does not need a formal contract, the SEC said, and transactions on secondary markets may still violate securities laws.  The SEC pointed to its recent legal win against LBRY as one of its examples in making this second argument.  Coinbase is also wrong in its major questions doctrine argument, the SEC said: ""This case, by contrast, involves the SEC’s exercise of its longstanding authority to enforce statutory requirements. In 1934, Congress authorized the SEC to enforce the federal securities laws through civil law enforcement actions.""

42419928,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUGh7V,1688764537,Why Edinburgh Is Zumo's Crypto Hub,"Crypto Founders on Crypto Hubs is a series of interviews with entrepreneurs about where their startup is located and why. It is part of Crypto Hubs 2023. In this installment, CoinDesk senior editor Jeanhee Kim interviewed Nick Jones, co-founder and CEO of digital-assets infrastructure platform Zumo. Their conversation was transcribed and edited for clarity and length.  Describe Zumo in a few words.  Zumo is a digital-assets infrastructure platform that allows Web2 companies to get into Web3.  Where is your company established?  The company is based in Edinburgh, Scotland. Our team is all fairly heavily distributed in the U.K. and increasingly across Europe as well. We are fairly decentralized as a business, albeit still with a hub in Edinburgh.  Why Edinburgh?  My co-founder, Paul Roach, and I had both relocated to Edinburgh for different reasons and wanted to start a business here. And Edinburgh has a pretty rich heritage in computer science. Our university always comes in the top three schools in Europe by informatics and it also at the time was launching its first blockchain and AI accelerator and we got a place in that first cohort in 2018.  Nick Jones is co-founder and CEO of Zumo, which brings crypto to a mainstream audience through security, usability and a commitment to financial inclusion.  Edinburgh is probably No. 2 in the U.K. as a startup hub, it felt like there was a good mixture of talent. We've decided to stay probably because of the pandemic allowing us to not have to rely on the very good, but fairly small, talent pool in Scotland. There are only 5.5 million people in Scotland. It's a secondary hub for financial services or banking for the U.K. outside of London, so people tend to get hoovered up, especially the good ones.  How long is your horizon to stay in Edinburgh?  There's a few things happening at the moment. One is what we think is going to happen with the U.K., from a regulatory point of view. The desire to make it a real digital-assets hub is very, very encouraging. We'd like it to happen a bit faster because it's been in the works for a while.  There's been a huge number of disadvantages to Brexit, maybe one of the advantages can be some more freedom to operate within from a digital-assets point of view. We haven't seen a lot of those benefits yet.  We have lots of people who work in London. I lived in London for a long time and there are incredibly close ties between Edinburgh and London as the two main financial hubs in the U.K. There's like 10 flights a day or something. They're super connected bases. As long as the U.K. continues on this path towards becoming a kind of a new Singapore or a new Switzerland or another Abu Dhabi, then we really want to stay and be part of that. We've been in and around the market for a fairly long time and where we see the real strength for London and the U.K. will be the combination of TradFi (traditional finance) and DeFi (decentralized finance), building on the heritage of London.  Read Crypto Hubs 2023: Where to Live Freely and Work Smart  We're targeting a secondary regulatory hub in Abu Dhabi this year. We believe that's a great way of reaching into MENA and South Asia in the same way we've used London as a springboard for Europe.  CoinDesk rated Dubai higher as a crypto hub. How did you choose between Abu Dhabi and Dubai?  We're focused on selling into TradFi, so we felt that Abu Dhabi was a really strong fit. The answer is you wouldn't make a bad choice with either market. We just felt there was great alignment with the TradFi piece, certainly with the broader reach into South India as well as a fairly well-trodden path selling into the South Asian market. If we were planning on relaunching Zumo as a B2C consumer business, I might want to consider Dubai first.  Is Zumo entirely registered in Scotland?  No, but all U.K. Our FCA (Financial Conduct Authority) registered business is Scottish listed and our holding company is English listed. That's a fairly common set up. Not least there's a potential hedge against Scottish independence and if that did happen, what that might cause from a regulatory clarity point of view. We have a pretty boring – by crypto standards – regulatory setup. We don't have anything funky going on with anything in the Cayman Islands or anything like that. We will obviously have to have an Abu Dhabi company when we launch there, as I'm sure we will have a European entity by the end of the year as well.  You’ve told us about the pros of Edinburgh. Are there any cons?  It’s a small town. I’d say the top-talent pool – this is the biggest challenge – and then the cost that goes with the talent pool.  Then there’s still the fear if you've been in the industry here [in the U.K.] for quite a while, as we have, that it doesn't go quite as planned. There's pretty encouraging noises coming from what's likely to be the future Labour government. It doesn't look like they want to rock the boat and turn back Brexit. So the risk there is becoming less and less.  Are you and your co-founder native to Scotland?  He’s from Aberdeen and he went to University of Edinburgh. But I was born in England. There's more Scottish people in England then there are in Scotland or something like that. There's a lot of movement, particularly that London-Edinburgh, financial services thing. It's a really well-trodden route.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET,"Nick Jones, Jeanhee Kim",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/07/07/why-edinburgh-is-zumos-crypto-hub,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/434e9daf154590dd878dd5f27632a6e0c1c320e4-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This has left many wondering just how much digital currency has been pilfered from right under the nose of the industry over the years. Now, the latest report by blockchain security firm SlowMist seems to have the answer. According to the recently released report, hackers and scammers have made off with a staggering $30 billion in cryptocurrency since 2012. Details Of The Report The SlowMist team analyzed 1,101 hacking incidents to determine how much crypto has been stolen to date and how they were stolen. Their findings show that hackers and scammers employ a variety of methods, with the top ones being contract vulnerability attacks, rug pulls, flash loan attacks, scams, leaking of private keys, and good old phishing attacks to gain access to people’s crypto accounts and wallets. Related Reading: Cardano Foundation Collaborates With Epoch Sports And Merchandise For Lacrosse Championship 2023 The most lucrative year for malicious players came in 2021 during the extended crypto hype, with over $9.7 billion stolen in 236 attacks. In total, the amount stolen in the last decade came up to a little over $30 billion. And given that the overall market cap of all cryptocurrencies is now at $1.14 trillion, the amount reported stolen is over 2.5% of the total market cap. Over $30 billion stolen in 10 years | Source: SlowMist Exchanges And Ethereum Ecosystem Hit The Most Exchanges have always long been a prime target for hackers looking to steal crypto due to their large holdings and the SlowMist report reflects that. In total, over 118 attacks were carried out on exchanges, resulting in over $10.9 billion being lost. The biggest of these could be traced back to the $534 million lost in the 2018 Japanese exchange Coincheck hack and the 2014 Mt. Gov hack resulting in a loss of over $473 million. Total market cap chart sitting at $1.139 trillion | Source: Crypto Total Market Cap on TradingView.com In terms of attacks on blockchain ecosystems, Ethereum came out on top with 217 attacks and over $3.1 billion being pilfered away. This should come as no surprise, considering Ethereum is home to most Web3 projects. The BSC and EOS ecosystems followed closely with 162 and 119 attacks, respectively. Additionally, over $200 million were lost in NFT attacks, while bridge attacks led to $2 billion in losses. What’s Next For The Crypto Industry? The staggering numbers in SlowMist’s report are a reminder that crypto, for all its promise, also has a dark side. However, attacks seem to have been slowing down as many projects have started to improve their security. With more than a trillion dollars at stake, reducing theft should be a collaborative effort across the entire crypto landscape.

42419927,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUGh5R,1688759446,"BlackRock CEO’s Turnabout on Bitcoin Elicits Cheers, Skepticism of Crypto Cred","BlackRock CEO Larry Fink's change of heart on bitcoin (BTC) could make it easier for fellow Wall Street executives to embrace cryptocurrencies, but some experts warn that his favored financial instrument – the exchange-traded fund, or ETF – is an investment vehicle that's categorically different from the original ideals of digital assets and could push the industry in the wrong direction.  The key distinction is that an ETF is simply a traditional investment vehicle, with bitcoin as the asset, but traded on a regulated stock exchange, via regulated brokers. Such structures might be anathema to Bitcoin, designed and then launched in 2009 by a pseudonymous creator – partly as a backlash against the Wall Street excesses that fueled the global financial crisis a year earlier – as an internet-based, peer-to-peer payments network that would be free from government control.  So the reception from the crypto faithful might be mixed, even if Fink’s newfound fondness might have helped to support the recent rally in bitcoin’s price, now up 82% year-to-date.  “Crypto is losing the plot,” said Jim Bianco, president of Bianco Research. “It is supposed to be about decentralization, permissionless and self-sovereignty. Getting excited that it is going to become a more accessible poker chip is nice and will help degens in the short term, but it will not help to fulfill the real promise of crypto.”  Fink, who until this week was known to be a skeptic of crypto and at one point called bitcoin “an index of money laundering,” said on Wednesday that it could “revolutionize finance.”  However, rather than praising the core idea behind the newly-built digital asset market, mainly decentralization, Fink said that the asset manager’s main goal was to make it easier and cheaper to trade and invest in bitcoin. Some industry experts worried whether BlackRock might be in it for the wrong reasons.  “Arguments have been made that ETFs, as well as bitcoin exchanges, ignore what some believe is the single most important feature of bitcoin, the ability to control their funds without the need to place trust in a third-party to manage the asset,” said Jim Iourio, managing director of TJM Institutional Services and a veteran futures and options trader. “This flies in the face of Bitcoin’s entire point of existence.”  Crypto was built on the idea that money shouldn't have to be tied to a third-party or middlemen, such as banks or even governments, and is therefore immune to manipulation of any sort.  When it comes to ETFs, the provider (in this case BlackRock, if it wins regulatory approval to launch the product) owns the underlying asset and sells shares of the fund to investors. It works in a way that crypto was built to change.  “So-called mainstream adoption will bring waves of new entrants to bitcoin, and the risk is that they won’t care, and won’t protect the decentralization properties that make it valuable over centralized alternatives in the first place,” Alex Thorn, head of research at the digital-asset financial firm Galaxy, wrote this week in a report.  Mainstream adoption  Nevertheless, when the leader of the biggest asset manager in the world openly admits that, contrary to his opinion a few years ago, he now sees bitcoin as “digitizing gold,” it can’t be all so negative – at least for now.  Validation from people like Fink could help with mass adoption, further ingraining bitcoin in mainstream usage and public consciousness.  Paul McCaffery, managing director at boutique investment firm Keefe Bruyette & Woods, or KBW, said he believed Fink's embrace could pave the way for other Wall Street investors to express comfort with Bitcoin, and allocate more money to the cryptocurrency.  “It’s a game-changer,"" he said.

14627172,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=541778,1688756440,Arbitrum DAO Locks $770 Million In ARB Tokens Into Vesting Contract: Implications For ARB,"Arbitrum DAO recently took a step toward addressing an obstacle. The DAO has committed to locking 700 million ARB tokens, valued at an estimated $770 million, into a vesting contract to foster transparent governance and accountability, per a community proposal. The approval for this commitment came from an improvement proposal introduced during a contentious period within the Arbitrum ecosystem. The specifics of this commitment involve gradually releasing these funds to the Arbitrum Foundation over four years. Details Of The Vesting Contract The new initiative, aptly termed AIP 1.1, solves recent disagreements concerning Arbitrum’s internal governance. Earlier this year, the project was embroiled in controversy due to a proposal for a ‘special grants’ program. Related Reading: Arbitrum Gains Tempered By Obstacles, Hindering ARB’s Further Upswing This controversial program was originally designed to assign more than 700 million ARB tokens directly to the Arbitrum Foundation. These funds, representing $1 billion at the time, were proposed to be directed toward backing projects utilizing Arbitrum’s advanced technology. The sheer magnitude of the allocation sparked concerns about the transparency of a project whose ethos is grounded in collective decision-making. This resulted in an alternate proposal to redirect the funds from the Foundation back to the DAO, which was subsequently rejected. To satisfy the concerns of the community, the proposal AIP-1.1 was introduced. This strategic proposal aimed to impose stricter controls on the allocation of the DAO’s treasury. This plan empowers the DAO with the authority to modify the vesting period, allowing them to lengthen, shorten, or even halt the vesting process entirely. This move towards financial transparency marks a milestone for Arbitrum’s DAO, reinforcing its commitment to its decentralized and democratic ethos. It not only provides a check on the arbitrary allocation of funds but also ensures that decisions align with the interests of the Arbitrum community. Implications for Arbitrum Securing $770 million in ARB tokens through a vesting contract is a significant event for Arbitrum’s DAO. By taking this action, the Arbitrum Foundation can establish a consistent source of funding and demonstrate to the community at large their dedication to transparency and accountability. The measure could also impact the market dynamics for the ARB token. With a significant amount of the tokens locked up, the reduced supply could potentially influence its price. This further underscores the importance of this step by the Arbitrum DAO, as its ramifications extend beyond governance to directly influencing the ecosystem’s dynamics. Related Reading: Arbitrum Airdrop Success: Metrics Soar Higher Across The Board Furthermore, this development within the Arbitrum ecosystem signifies the project’s maturity and commitment to its democratic ideals. It exemplifies how DAOs can effectively manage significant resources while maintaining transparency and accountability, setting a precedent for other similar organizations in the crypto ecosystem. Meanwhile, over the past 24 hours, Arbitrum’s native token ARB has witnessed an upward trend of 2.3%. This bullish trend comes after the asset has seen slight retracement in the past week, dropping by nearly 2%. ARB currently has a market price of $1.12 at the time of writing.

But while Bitcoin (BTC) prepares for the next rally, it appears that Tradecurve — a new cryptocurrency trading platform — is leading the altcoin pump with 80% gains during the ongoing presale. Let's look at why these two assets are so bullish. Tradecurve: More Gains Ahead? Tradecurve is shaping up to be a comprehensive trading platform that offers a wide array of investment options — think stocks, commodities, currencies, and indices — all under one roof. The aim is to offer a one-stop-shop for users to manage their diverse investment portfolios, irrespective of where they are in the world. The beauty of Tradecurve lies in its simplicity. Joining the platform is as easy as providing an email and linking your DeFi wallet. There's no need to go through the usual hoops of identity verification or other cumbersome onboarding procedures, making it a breath of fresh air in the otherwise intrusive investment landscape. Beyond just trading, Tradecurve also offers an arsenal of advanced tools designed to amplify your trading experience and potential returns. They offer a subscription to an AI-powered trading tool, for instance, that automates trading strategies and offers in-depth analytics on all markets. The TCRV token, the lifeblood of the Tradecurve platform, also unlocks a host of benefits. Holders can stake tokens to earn passive income, avail of VIP account benefits, get discounts on subscription fees, and more as Tradecurve continues to establish itself in the DeFi world. At present, the TCRV token is available at a bargain price of $0.018 during the presale. Considering that experts predict the value of the token could skyrocket to $1.00 after its listing on leading exchanges later this year, this presale might just be a golden opportunity to jump on board the Tradecurve bandwagon. Bitcoin (BTC) To $40K? Tradecurve isn't the only digital asset in the spotlight — Bitcoin (BTC) is preparing for its next rally and could hit $40,000 in July. This prediction comes from noted crypto analysts who suggest that an influx of institutional investors could push Bitcoin (BTC) prices to fresh all-time highs. This news was triggered by the news that Blackrock, the largest global asset manager in the world, recently filed an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) for Bitcoin (BTC). This significant move signals Wall Streets' increasing confidence in Bitcoin (BTC), marking a pivotal moment in the cryptocurrency sphere. While this news should have long-term impacts, Bitcoin (BTC)'s price has already pushed from $28.4k to a peak of just above $31k within a week. Analysts are watching closely, speculating this news could herald the onset of a new bull market for Bitcoin (BTC). You see, approval of the Bitcoin ETF could trigger a substantial flow of capital into the crypto market. ETFs present an opportunity for traditional and institutional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without the need to personally buy, store, and manage the cryptocurrency. However, they caution that for this upward trajectory to continue, Bitcoin (BTC) will first need to break through the $31-32k resistance level. The current price of $30,600 has the market bullish, with many anticipating a breakout and pump to the $36,000 - $40,000 range within days.

This burgeoning interest is further piqued by the myriad of projects that have sprung up, each promising unique value propositions and significant ROI. While the sheer volume of altcoins can be daunting to newcomers, this article will explore the seven best crypto to buy now not named Bitcoin. From altcoins specializing in fractionalized NFT investing, play-to-earn gaming rewards, and enhancing DeFi connectivity to revolutionizing rendering processes, these coins offer a diversified investment portfolio for beginners and experienced investors. Best Crypto To Buy Now Not Named Bitcoin Beyond Bitcoin, the crypto market brims with promising altcoins, each representing unique value propositions. Seven standout tokens include InQubeta, pioneering fractionalized NFT investing in AI startups; DigiToads, intertwining play-to-earn gaming with NFTs; Manifold Finance, augmenting DeFi connectivity; Ocean Protocol, democratizing data access; Trust Wallet Token, driving a popular wallet ecosystem; Render, revolutionizing rendering processes; and Litecoin, an enduring alternative to Bitcoin. These diverse tokens offer profitable investment opportunities for every investor's portfolio. InQubeta (QUBE) - Best Altcoin For Fractionalized NFT Investing A game-changing project in the cryptocurrency space, InQubeta has set its sights on changing how we invest in AI startups. With the QUBE token at its core, InQubeta offers an innovative and sophisticated platform for fractionalized investment in AI enterprises. Its groundbreaking approach allows even the smallest investors to have a stake in some of the most promising AI projects in the industry. InQubeta leverages the power of Web3 to bring to life the world's first fractionalized AI NFT crowdfunding platform. The platform turns investment opportunities into Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), which can then be fractionalized and distributed to investors. This revolutionary approach to fundraising means that everyone can get a piece of the AI startup action, thereby democratizing investment and engaging a broader community of stakeholders. The QUBE token is an integral part of the InQubeta ecosystem. It is a deflationary token, meaning its supply reduces over time due to a burning mechanism. Thus, 2% of QUBE token sales and 1% of purchases are burned, ensuring scarcity and helping to bolster the token's value over time. The token is vested over 12 weeks. InQubeta has its own custom-built NFT marketplace, which allows AI startups to raise funds and offer reward and equity-based NFTs to their investors. By purchasing QUBE tokens, holders can directly invest in these promising projects, fostering a thriving ecosystem and generating potential returns, with experts anticipating the price of QUBE to rise more than 5x after the presale. DigiToads (TOADS) - Play-to-Earn (P2E) Gaming and Rewards DigiToads operates as a full utility meme coin with a unique play-to-earn (P2E) gaming aspect, setting it apart as one of the best cryptos for beginners looking to delve into the NFT space. The P2E model incorporates a fascinating web3 game where players can collect, nurture, and battle DigiToads, adding an interactive dimension to this cryptocurrency investment. These digital amphibians can be acquired through buying, trading, or winning, making TOADS tokens an integral part of the gaming ecosystem. These tokens purchase various items, including food, potions, and training equipment for the DigiToads, creating an engaging virtual environment for players. This play-to-earn feature extends beyond mere gaming; it provides a pathway for players to earn TOADS tokens, one of the top crypto coins to buy today. The DigiToads game rewards the top 25% of players on the leaderboard with TOADS tokens, creating a competitive environment that incentivizes player performance. Furthermore, 50% of the funds obtained from in-game item sales are allocated to the prize fund for distribution among the top 25% of players. Therefore, the game design caters to a fun and competitive player experience and serves as an avenue for participants to earn cryptocurrency rewards. Considering the high-growth potential of TOADS tokens, they are arguably one of the best cryptos to invest in now. The P2E model is up-and-coming for those wondering what crypto to invest in, as the DigiToads project offers a direct earning potential through gameplay. Moreover, the regular prize pool payouts to top performers in the game underscore the potential returns for skilled and dedicated players. As the popularity of P2E gaming continues to rise, DigiToads is positioned as a leading project in this innovative intersection of gaming and crypto investments. It is one of the most promising presales to buy now that can experience over 450% growth in the near future.

The functionality to shield users from MEV attacks has been the first offering in the Manifold Finance product line. MEV refers to the profit potential by changing the order of transactions within a block. In this area, miners or validators enjoy the power to choose transactions for inclusion in blocks. Selected as a promising cryptocurrency for beginners, $FOLD—through its product, OpenMEV—provides security against sandwich attacks, a common MEV attack. Sandwich attacks occur when a trader places transactions before and after a victim transaction, capturing the price difference. OpenMEV shields users from such exploitations, returning funds and fees to traders. Utilizing MEV opportunities, OpenMEV employs secure smart contract techniques to scale services like SushiSwap for end-users, an invaluable aspect for beginner cryptocurrency investors seeking the best crypto to invest in.

Among those that have resigned include Binance General Counsel Han Ng, Chief Strategy Officer Patrick Hillmann, and Senior Vice President for Compliance Steven Christie, the person said . The DOJ investigation was said to pertain to Binance's attempts to trick U.S. regulators , as well as allegedly laundering money and violating sanctions. The company is already under heightened scrutiny from a number of regulators across the globe. Recall last month when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Binance and CZ, as he is known, for allegedly committing 13 counts of securities law breaches. That's in addition to the Commodity and Futures Trade Commission's suit that accused the exchange of violating certain trading and derivatives rules. Hillman, nonetheless, said he left Binance ""on good terms. ""I’ve been here for two years and it’s simply time for me to move on to the next challenge,"" he wrote in a Twitter post dated Thursday. ""I’ve taken this company through a lifetime of industry crises and regulatory challenges — from Luna to 3AC to FTX. Despite all of these challenges, the company has continued to grow and thrive,"" he added. Earlier, CZ took to Twitter to dismiss the exodus of executives, saying the departures are part of Binance's usual turnover of staff. ""More FUD about some departures. Yes, there is turnover (at every company). But the reasons dreamed up by the “news” are completely wrong,"" he wrote .

Epoch Sports and Merchandise have outlined their plans to release the remaining NFC-enabled Commemorative Jerseys, accompanied by connected NFTs, on the official web store of the 2023 World Lacrosse Championship. The NFC patches incorporated into the jerseys serve a dual purpose. They also grant the consumers access to a range of exclusive rewards and special offers. Cardano’s Collaboration Aims To Enhance IP Protection And Tackle Counterfeiting The technical collaboration between the Cardano Foundation, Epoch Sports, and Merchandise aims to promote blockchain adoption within the licensed merchandise industry while bolstering the protection of licensed intellectual property (IP). By securely linking NFC chips to a blockchain record in the form of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), traditional licensed IP hologram tags on sports apparel will be replaced. According to the press release, this guarantees authenticity for purchasers and empowers license owners to combat counterfeiting effectively.

Pool.pm provides an overview of the blockchain, allowing users to access the on-chain records. Frederik Gregaard, the CEO of the Cardano Foundation, said: Our work with Merchandise and Epoch Sports showcases the utility and accessibility of Cardano’s blockchain: any merchant can adopt blockchain solutions to give reassurance and confidence to customers that they are buying genuine articles.

The native token of the Storj protocol spiked 43% rise on Tuesday, and although it has retreated slightly since, it has recently gained 15% over the last seven days. Filecoin’s FIL, a competitor of Storj, with an almost $2 billion market value (compared to Storj’s $145 million), also gained 12% over the last seven days.  Storj is one of a few competing crypto-backed cloud storage platforms and is often described as an alternative to cloud storage platforms like those offered by Amazon or Google. Filecoin is also a decentralized protocol that enables users to rent out spare storage on their computer.  Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value, sank 0.7% over the same time period. Ether took a harder hit, losing 3.5%. Bitcoin has traded above $30,000 for a couple of weeks, but has struggled to reach the $32,000 level.  Traders have pointed to the current uncertainty in the market as the reason behind the stagnant price movement. Markets are weighing conflicting economic data and ongoing central bank deliberations about how to tame stubbornly high inflation without casting the economy into a steep recession.  “There's more cause for optimism on the back of the ETF filings but there's no guarantee they will yield a positive outcome even if the chances are enhanced by the backing of those involved. It could also be a lengthy process which may explain the stall we've seen over the last couple of weeks,” wrote Craig Erlham, senior market analyst at OANDA.  Solana’s SOL also posted considerable gains on the week, rising 12% SOL was up 8% on Friday alone. The reason behind the uptick is unclear, but some analysts are predicting a continued surge for the token.  Sean Farrell, head of digital asset research at data firm FundStrat, said that it's not clear what the catalyst is but “it's possible that conditions became super oversold in the wake of the Robinhood forced selling and now we are regressing back to prior support levels.”  The CoinDesk Market Index, a measure of crypto markets performance, has dropped 1.3% over the past seven days.

SEC,"Summary The SEC has rejected applications for ETFs that directly track Bitcoin's price due to concerns of fraud and market manipulation. This rejection notably included products by BlackRock and Fidelity. Regardless of the SEC's consistent rejections since 2017, several ETFs owning Bitcoin futures have successfully entered the market. The recent SEC rejections come as no surprise given their previous stance. The key points in Grayscale's argument are around the inconsistency of the SEC's stance on the futures ETF, and the potential of a spot ETF to rely on the same fraud monitoring system. GBTC's current 28% discount to NAV, the potential price action from the upcoming Bitcoin halving, and Grayscale's intent to convert the closed-end fund into an ETF/ETN make it an attractive investment proposition. The most recent notable development around U.S. cryptocurrency ETFs is a WSJ article reporting that the SEC dismissed applications by BlackRock ( BLK ) and Fidelity to get vehicles approved as not good enough. The companies have since refiled applications , though. An ETF directly investing in Bitcoin would be a pivotal event for the crypto industry, expanding access to the cryptocurrency and simplifying its purchase and sale. So far, the SEC has consistently denied these funds market access since 2017. The key problem the agency identifies is susceptibility to ""fraud"" and potential market manipulation. Despite this, several ETFs owning Bitcoin futures, with prices correlating very closely to Bitcoin spot prices, have been allowed to enter the market. According to the WSJ article, many insiders predicted that BlackRock's filing, which this time proposed a ""surveillance-sharing agreement"" with Nasdaq (where the ETF would be listed), would ease the SEC's concerns. It didn't, and the SEC denied it reportedly again based on the surveillance agreements around spot Bitcoin. This isn't that surprising because it has been their go-to line. With the decision in the Grayscale vs. SEC court case coming up somewhere in the next few months, I don't expect that to change until the court comes up with a ruling there. The arguments raised in the Grayscale vs. SEC lawsuit by both sides explain this most recent rejection. I've written about the case more extensively here but here are the key quotes of how I've laid it out there: Futures derive their prices from spot and are approved by the SEC. Because the SEC has accepted the situation of the futures ETF where; futures and off-exchange manipulation will be spotted by CME (Futures exchange) a Bitcoin spot ETF (while fraud monitoring futures) should be allowed as well. In contrast, The SEC's position seems to be that the manipulation of the off-exchange Bitcoin spot would be spotted in Futures because the price action would also show up there. However, the SEC is also arguing that the manipulation of off-exchange Bitcoin spot to defraud investors in a potential spot ETF wouldn't necessarily show up in the futures and wouldn't necessarily be spotted. The positions taken in court seem to be in line with the position taken in court. The SEC is simply still not enthusiastic about surveillance-sharing agreements that aren't set up to monitor spot manipulation directly. Grayscale argued the spot ETF could rely on the same fraud monitoring system the futures ETF use (which makes quite a bit of sense to me). However, the court has not decided whether Grayscale's or the SEC's view should prevail in this matter. Given this context, the latest rejection is unsurprising. I think the companies just want to be ready and far along the process once a ruling does come down. Consequently, how the court will rule in the SEC vs. Grayscale case matters. What's interesting about this latest round of filings is that even if Grayscale is unsuccessful in 1) getting to convert its closed-end fund; The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( BTC )"" target=""_blank"">OTC:GBTC ) to an ETF or 2) capture the top spot as nr.1 ETF with GBTC, the launches of Bitcoin ETFs by Fidelity and BlackRock could be enough to trigger substantial inflows as transacting and custody of Bitcoin become so much easier and more accessible. Aside from GBTC specifically, for the Bitcoin price itself, it could be more favorable if BlackRock or Fidelity ends up with the nr.1 ETF. Going back to October 2022, I've been tactically invested in Bitcoin , specifically through Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust with the intent to hold until it transitions into an ETF. Or at least until this intent is communicated clearly, and the discount narrows significantly. Back then, GBTC traded at a 40.4% discount to the spot Bitcoin it holds. This has since ""narrowed"" to 28%, but I think it can narrow to ~0% if ETF status is obtained. Part of my justification for a GBTC long is that I believe (based on the most recent hearing transcript) that Grayscale's legal case against the SEC is progressing well, Grayscale has a strong case and a decision is anticipated before year's end. There is clearly a risk that the court does not rule in favor of Grayscale. A negative ruling would almost surely immediately lead to the discount widening back out. There is also a small chance that the court rules in favor of Grayscale, but the SEC decides to shut down the futures ETF instead of allowing spot ETFs. An unlikely path forward, but it's worth being aware of. There are also reasons to like Bitcoin more generally that are obviously relevant to any unhedged investment in GBTC. First, the banking tremors of 2023 with even large banks like First Republic and Credit Suisse suddenly getting taken over for small sums has helped accelerate a renewed interest in crypto. The tremors have subsided as the Fed has provided a lot of liquidity to the banking system. However, I can easily see interest rates being increased a bit further. Inflation is down but not out and the official target of 2% still appears to be quite distant. Second, the next upcoming Bitcoin halving, expected within 285 days , generally leads to Bitcoin prices rising. This event makes it harder for Bitcoin ""miners"" to deliver supply to the market because it decreases the rewards these players receive for their work. The miners are a consistent source of supply in the market and this inevitably decreases that supply. It's not a guarantee to overshadow other forces of supply-and-demand, but historically it has been a good time to be long Bitcoin. Finally, the discount on GBTC, coupled with Bitcoin's potential price action, makes it an attractive proposition. If Grayscale converts the fund into an ETF, this would lead to a 38% uplift. If a 28% discount goes to 0% this corresponds to ~38% price appreciation. It is not exactly my strong suit, but you could also argue technical indicators support GBTC and Bitcoin, providing additional encouragement for investors. Data by YCharts I'll be the first to agree that regulatory decisions as well as market movements are not easy to predict even within wide bands. However, to sum up my views on GBTC; an upcoming Bitcoin halving and GBTC's potential to appreciate by ~38% if converted into an ETF are hard to resist. My optimism is lightly reinforced by technical indicators supporting Bitcoin and GBTC. Keep in mind that a negative ruling out of the courts would immediately set GBTC back. Even in a best-case scenario, this would lead to a conversion getting delayed.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4615767-grayscale-bitcoin-trust-remains-attractive-at-28-percent-discount-to-nav?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/14624990.jpeg
42419941,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUGhGn,1688751320,Binance Feels Strain of World’s Regulators Leaping Into Action,"Australian officials directly sought out current and former employees of Binance’s operation there this week, demanding copies of internal communications and data from their personal devices, according to a person familiar with the government’s move against the leading crypto exchange, which marked the latest in a pile-up of legal troubles facing the company.  The representatives of Binance were individually contacted by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) outside the company’s offices this week in a coordinated effort, the person said, marking yet another jurisdiction in which government watchdogs are closing in.  From weighty accusations by U.S. regulators, to a French raid, to a denial of licensing by the Dutch, to this probe in Australia, Binance is facing legal headwinds in many parts of the world, while its CEO is denying that a spate of departures of key legal and compliance executives is cause for concern.  The exchange had operated for years without serious regulatory intervention, but the arrival of some of those cases has pushed the company onto its heels. In the last month since the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission aimed a shotgun blast of charges at Binance and CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, the company has seen substantial customer withdrawals and watched its native BNB token slip 17%. The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission had made similar accusations against Binance earlier in the year, alleging the company deliberately evaded government oversight.  ""If the allegations against Binance are true, they implicate very serious criminal and civil misconduct, including national-security related issues,” said Alex Zerden, a former U.S. Treasury Department official who is founder and CEO of advisory firm Capitol Peak Strategies. “And given the exchange's global footprint, the investigation into Binance and these allegations would likely span multiple jurisdictions and require sustained cooperation among multiple jurisdictions.""  The latest case from ASIC centers on Binance Australia’s former derivatives operations, a spokesman for the company told CoinDesk, insisting that its offices weren’t visited by the investigators. While the company still runs a spot-trading exchange in the country, its futures products were shut down earlier this year.  ASIC confirmed an “ongoing” investigation with Binance, but a spokesperson said the regulator is ""unable to confirm or deny any operational detail such as possible searches.""  Binance had also been raided by the public prosecutor in Paris last month on suspicion of “aggravated money laundering” and providing “illegal” services. The investigation there is tied to claims Binance improperly operated as a digital asset service provider before receiving regulatory approval in May 2022, and accusations it engaged in ""aggravated money laundering by taking part in investment operations, concealment and conversion.”  The world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchange withdrew from the Netherlands last month when it couldn’t get the Dutch financial regulator to give it a virtual asset service provider (VASP) license, which attests that a company can clear the bar for local anti-money laundering (AML) requirements.  This week, reports have suggested that several key executives have exited Binance, including its general counsel, chief strategy officer, senior vice president for compliance and chief business officer. CZ tweeted Friday that there’s “turnover at every company,” and downplayed media suggestions that some people left because of how he was handling a U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) investigation of Binance.  The glut of pushback, lawsuits and investigations as countries in which Binance operates have simultaneously chosen to make their cases could suggest their regulators and prosecutors are comparing notes.  “Cross-border information sharing is generally cumbersome,” said Zerden, who is also an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security. Working across borders “can be incredibly frustrating for law enforcement and regulatory officials,” but when friendly jurisdictions have similar concerns, the work can move much more quickly.  “Binance remains committed to cooperating with requests from regulators,” the spokesman said this week.  Apart from the specifics surrounding Binance, its troubles could be amplified by its famous absence of a home base – a situation that governments may lose patience with.  “The operating environment is going to be more difficult for entities that want to operate in an undefined regulatory location,” said Yaya Fanusie, director of policy for AML and cyber risk at the Crypto Council for Innovation. “There's growing impatience among both regulators and compliant actors with firms that try to play regulatory arbitrage.”  The absence so far of criminal charges against Binance officials doesn’t necessarily mean the individuals haven’t already been indicted, such as by a U.S. grand jury. Some of the accusations by the U.S. securities and derivatives agencies suggest deliberate violations of law, though if sealed charges exist, they probably wouldn’t become apparent until executives come within reach of U.S. law enforcement and arrests are made.  One recent example was the Florida arrest of the founder of Hong Kong-based platform Bitzlato Ltd., Anatoly Legkodymov, when the Russian citizen showed up in Florida. That action against Legkodymov and the exchange was coordinated by the U.S. DOJ and French authorities. In that money-laundering case, a division of the U.S. Treasury named Binance as one of Bitzlato’s chief counterparties.  Binance continues doing business around the world despite its legal woes, though the accusations have done significant damage. The company’s U.S. arm, Binance.US, cut its staff and halted dollar deposits – converting into an all-crypto exchange – in the days after the SEC case emerged, saying in court filings it lost banking services. More recently, Binance’s euros banking partner, Paysafe Payment Solutions, announced it would stop supporting the crypto exchange after Sept. 25, forcing the company to seek another way to handle euro deposits and withdrawals.  So far, like rival Coinbase, Binance has begun battling the SEC in U.S. federal courts, where a number of crypto industry legal questions are already hanging in the balance.  ""Guidance from experienced and competent legal counsel is essential,"" said Joshua Klayman, who leads the digital-assets arm of the law firm Linklaters in the U.S. ""For companies in the digital asset space, in my view, this means a legal team that understands the relevant business and technology, as well as deep knowledge of the legal and regulatory landscape that has been unfolding over the past several years.""  The SEC has sought to control Binance’s flow of cash, with the regulator citing concerns that the exchange could make off with the funds of U.S. customers. In that fight, Binance recently enlisted M. Kendall Day, a former acting deputy assistant attorney general at the DOJ, adding the former U.S. prosecutor to its legal team that already includes prominent ex-DOJ and SEC officials.

42419944,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUGhKv,1688749693,How AI Data Sets Work – And How Artists Can Collaborate With Them,"Some of the most iconic cultural moments happened as a result of collaborations, from Jean-Michel Basquiat and Andy Warhol’s famous 1983 union to today’s limited-edition drops by contemporary artists and fashion houses.  Collaborations bring together different perspectives, skills and influences, resulting in unique and often groundbreaking creations. Today, artists are expanding their collaborative horizons through partnerships with a rather unconventional creative force: artificial intelligence (AI).  “On days when you're dealing with writer's block, or the synapses aren't firing in a certain way, it's been really cool to see [AI] technology spark that creative flow and expand the realm of ideation and possibility for artists,” said Chris McGarry, founder and CEO of AI music platform WarpSound.  But if you’ve ever tried to use the AI language model ChatGPT, entered an experimental prompt into the text-to-image model Stablediffusion or played around with Google’s text-to-music generator MusicLM, you may have noticed that AI can’t read minds – at least not yet. Your first attempts at working with AI tools may result in generic outputs, or simply ones that don’t quite capture what you had in mind.  “They are bad,” one musician joked of his experience trying out AI music generators. The comment was made in May during a workshop on AI music production at the inaugural Wavelengths Summit in Brooklyn, New York, hosted by the music research network Water & Music. Audience participants agreed that AI tools, while sophisticated, still come with a noticeable learning curve.  For creatives, tackling machine learning requires an understanding of how to best feed it data and refine its algorithm to complement one’s artistic endeavors.  How datasets work  One of the primary ways artists can harness the power of AI is by creating their own datasets, typically comprised of text, images, sounds, melodies and video. Each machine-learning project may require different-sized training data sets to be successful. There are plenty of helpful courses and videos available online that best explain how to optimize data sets.  To create a powerful tool that still feels “authentic,” artists can train machines based on their previous work. This can help them distinguish their AI collaborations from those generated by free and open-source models, which tend to use publicly available data and can sometimes come across as dry and generic.  Generally speaking, a free AI model’s data comes from publicly-published sources. The data is often procured by internet-crawling bots that scoop up widely available raw material and catalog the information. Meanwhile, private companies and research firms are more likely to use proprietary datasets, particularly when copyright laws are a concern.  “We have to find ways of using data that are legal,” said Michael Turbot, technology promotion manager at Sony Computer Science Lab (CSL) Paris, an independent research laboratory, during the Wavelengths Summit. The lab is working on AI-assisted music production tools for artists.  According to Turbot, Sony CSL is subject to an auditing process from Sony Music Publishing in order to work with any artists currently under contract with the publishing house. Sony CSL has therefore been careful to include only legally air-tight sounds and songs in its datasets, opting for public domain songs only, or songs belonging to artists working in partnership with Sony CSL who have given explicit permission.  “We have to be extremely careful with our use of data,” said Turbot. “Otherwise we know that the doors would be instantly closed by people, either in their industry or with artists.”  Creating your own dataset  Like private companies and labs, artists can curate their own datasets using their own material. Compiling the right data set is crucial for ensuring that AI accurately captures an artist's unique style and voice. The data set acts as the foundation for the AI algorithms, guiding its decision-making process.  Refining an AI data set involves a multi-step process. It starts with collecting high-quality source material, either from the artist's music or works that reflect their desired style. Some artists may merge different data sets to represent eras in their creative evolution or opt to create unique datasets for every new project.  “Lately, I've been taking old drawings from when I was really young,” said photorealistic AI artist Claire Silver in a February Twitter Space. “I've been putting them in AI with prompts to try and recreate what I was seeing back then and trying to draw, but didn't have the skill to share. And that's been really cool.”  Silver said she uses a combination of AI models, including DreamStudio and NMKD.  Literary artist Sasha Stiles, who has been collaborating with GPT language models since 2018, says she customizes her datasets with a “compendium of training materials” that started with drafts of her manuscript and all of her “human poetry.” She then added research notes, reference material and inspiring literature.  “Tucked in there [were] poems and essays that were germane to the things that I was writing about,” Stiles said. “There are excerpts from T.S. Eliot, there are passages from Whitman and Dickinson and there's actually little bits and pieces from various news articles as well.”  Stiles added that working with an AI language model was like “taking all the things that were swirling in my head when I was working on my manuscript, putting them into a system and using algorithms to synthesize them.”  With every medium, the quality of an artist’s dataset matters in order to produce the best outcome, but for musicians in particular, audio quality is of high importance. “When a producer or artist uses a model, it's essential to understand that the input voice quality is vital,” said Geraldo Ramos, CEO of Moises, an app that lets musicians build a customized library of songs. “If the singer performs poorly, the output will be as bad as the input.”  Letting AI stretch you artistically  Despite the expected $42.6 billion being poured into generative AI investments today, artistic collaborations with AI are still experimental. Curating and refining an AI data set requires an understanding of machine learning, attention to detail, lots of patience and ample curiosity.  That said, using AI in creative industries doesn’t appear to be a passing trend. The idea itself goes back to 1959 when the first book on computer-aided music composition was published, and it only seems to be accelerating with the rise of metaverse gaming and AI-powered non-fungible tokens (NFTs).  While AI offers incredible opportunities for creatives, some continue to voice concerns about its use cases, arguing that AI cannot replace human emotion, nor the connection formed between artists and fans. But if you do want to collaborate with AI in ways that respect your craft while evolving your work, crafting your own data set is a great way to start.",NEUTRAL,없음,REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Megan DeMatteo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/how-ai-data-sets-work-and-how-artists-can-collaborate-with-them,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bfea78edd09840fea6d4e50d429e4feaed3126b7-5700x3800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42419933,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUGh9Z,1688747967,The Real Use Case for CBDCs: Dethroning the Dollar,"Much like the cruel joke Charles de Gaulle reportedly cracked about Brazil – that it’s “the country of the future and always will be” – predictions of an end to the dollar-based international monetary system seem to belong to a future that will never arrive.  Yet that future is coming, faster than all the prior failed forecasts of the end of dollar hegemony would have you think. In contributing to that shift, Brazil may have the last laugh.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The catalyst can be found in central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), a model for digital fiat money that was, ironically, spurred by governments’ reaction to the 2008 invention of the decidedly anti-fiat Bitcoin protocol. Bitcoin fanatics tend to pooh-pooh CBDCs as centralized tools for government manipulation that local populations will recoil from. In dismissing them, they overlook the massive cross-border shifts these new tools will foster at the macro level.  As key export economies such as Brazil embrace CBDC-based direct settlement with their trading partners, it will spur a trend of de-dollarization over the next decade. The ramifications for U.S. capital markets, for the global economy, and for geopolitical power dynamics are profound.  Brazil's central bank is among more than a hundred experimenting with CBDCs. Others that matter for this discussion include the United Arab Emirates, Russia, Singapore and China, which is streets ahead in rolling out its electronic currency, the e-CNY. China, of course, has made no secret of its desire to reduce its dependency on dollars.  Those five economies account for around 25% of global output, but it’s their outsized roles in world trade – as exporters of oil (UAE’s Abu Dhabi), foodstuffs (Brazil), natural gas (Russia) and consumer goods (China) and as a finance and shipping entrepot (Singapore) – that amplifies the international impact of their respective currency strategies.  Things will get really interesting once such countries’ central banks use digital currencies in direct settlement arrangements with each other rather than going through the dollar, which is currently used as an intermediating currency in 90% of all trade finance. There are signs this is moving forward – from Singapore’s DBS Bank recent move allowing direct payments in e-CNY to multilateral institutions such as the Bank of International Settlements, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund encouraging member countries to collaborate on cross-border CBDC design. So, buckle up.  Cross-border CBDCs are what matter, not retail  People tend to view CBDCs through a retail lens, seeing them as new digital payment units that citizens would use in daily purchases. That somewhat overhyped idea has fueled concerns about state surveillance of people’s spending – to such an extent that opposition to CBDCs is now a campaign position of U.S. presidential candidates, including Republican hopeful Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and Democrat challenger to President Biden Robert F. Kennedy Jr.  While those privacy concerns are valid – see my critique of the European Commission’s CBDC plans last week – they’re a sideshow. The far bigger issue lies in wholesale, cross-border transactions.  I’ve been arguing for some time that protocol-based interoperability for countries to directly exchange digital fiat currencies would have a dramatic impact on the international monetary system.  By cryptographically locking an exchange rate forward-contracts into a decentralized, blockchain-based escrow structure could protect an exporter and an importer from currency volatility over the timeframe of their trade deal without either party having to trust the other, or anyone else, to hold the funds. Voilà, no need for the dollar to sit in the middle.  Under this system, a Brazilian farmer could agree to provide a Chinese hoggery with soymeal feed for its pigs at a real-to-renminbi exchange rate fixed at signing, knowing that a smart contract would automatically deliver those funds upon arrival of the shipment in Shanghai. With the right oracles in place, all this would happen peer-to-peer without either side having to trust the other’s promise to deliver the funds or the goods.  As such, they could eschew the grossly inefficient current system in which a U.S.-regulated correspondent bank typically acts as the trusted third party in the deal, first exchanging the importer’s renminbi into dollars and then converting them into reals for the Brazilian exporter. If such arrangements proliferated, I have argued, it would reduce global trade-related demand for dollars and, by extension, diminish investment in dollar reserve assets such as U.S. government bonds.  Now, after listening to influential economist Zoltan Pozsar on the Odd Lots podcast with Bloomberg’s Joe Weisenthal and Tracy Alloway, I see that it will likely be the collaborating efforts of central banks, rather than direct importer-exporter agreements, that will forge this path toward disintermediated digital settlement.  Pozsar sees CBDC-wielding central banks adopting new roles as clearing agents for their country’s exporting and importing firms and then using CBDCs to settle directly with their foreign counterparts. In this way, they would displace the all-powerful dollar-based correspondent banks of Wall Street, such as J.P. Morgan and Citibank. The upshot is that countries won’t need as many dollars.  Pozsar sees the trend driven by mid-tier trade-heavy economies, those that play an outsize role in the demand and supply of dollars worldwide. Net exporting countries that run trade surpluses will accumulate fewer dollars and so will supply less greenbacks to global foreign exchange markets. And importers that run trade deficits will have less demand for the dollars they previously needed to pay for things.  Depleted dollar demand  It’s all part of Pozsar’s “Bretton Woods III” vision, where the dollar ultimately loses its hegemonic status over the next decade. Importantly, he sees a different outcome from that of the British pound’s loss of reserve status in the early 20th century, when the U.S. dollar simply supplanted it. Instead, he predicts a multi-currency world where no one currency is dominant, a result made possible because of CBDC clearing mechanisms, which negate the need for reserve currency intermediation. Negotiating counterparts will need to agree on which of their two currencies to denominate their trade deal in, but they won’t have to default to the dollar, or some other universal standard, for actual settlement.  So China is not destined, as some have argued, to become the world’s reserve currency leader. Nonetheless, it will likely see its global influence grow as more of its trade contracts are listed in renminbi. The trend is already underway, with Russia, Brazil, Argentia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and other countries all agreeing to denominate trade with China in its currency. Even U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has said a gradual decline in worldwide dollar reserves is to be expected.  Depending on how fast the trend occurs, it will have major implications for the U.S. The debt racked up by U.S. consumers, companies and government entities is in part sustained by the ongoing demand for dollar assets by foreign entities. The inflows prop up U.S. bonds, which in turn depresses their yields and, by extension, keeps broader U.S. interest rates low. Americans’ mortgages are affordable because of foreign demand for dollars. If that demand drops off, the cost of capital in the U.S. will rise – likely significantly.  Don’t fight the inevitable  How should the U.S. respond?  I see this is an “if you can’t fight them, join them” moment. There’s no getting around Wall Street banks’ gradual loss of intermediary status, which will mean Washington can no longer use those institutions as agents for surveilling the world’s transactions. The U.S. should accept that reality and consider how to leverage the potentially fleeting advantage it still enjoys as the issuer of a currency desired the world over. It should lean into the “soft power” aspects of the dollar’s dominance – the open, rule-of-law values that underpin its value – and give up on the “hard power” elements of gatekeeping and control.  The soft-power approach works because it reinforces the diminished but still widely held impression of the U.S. as an open, advanced economy and it gives the U.S. a chance to lead monetary innovation for the benefit of users around the world.  That path forward is the opposite of China’s “panopticon” centralized digital fiat currency. There’s no compelling reason for the U.S. to develop a retail CBDC. Rather, official digital dollars should be reserved for inter-central bank cross-border settlement while domestic-use digital money should be opened up to private players using decentralized models with crypto technology. That’s where the real innovative edge will be found.  Sadly, as readers of CoinDesk will know, the U.S. government’s current agenda seems very far from that crypto-friendly approach.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,Michael J.

14623243,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=541768,1688747436,Surging Demand For Bitcoin Ordinals Propels Q2 Trading Volume To $210M,"Bitcoin Ordinals’ unique non-fungible token (NFT) inscriptions on the Bitcoin blockchain have recently registered over $210 million in trading volume in the first half of 2023 alone. This new wave of innovation, coupled with the volume recorded so far, demonstrates the potential that lies within the intersection of blockchain technology and digital artistry. Bitcoin Ordinals’ Q2 Performance Defies Expectations In a recent quarterly report from DappRadar, a rise in trading volume was documented for Bitcoin in the second quarter of 2023. The data, characterized by notable fluctuations, attributes this heightened trading activity to an increased interest in Ordinals, suggesting a marked shift in trader preferences and investment strategies. Related Reading: Bitcoin Ordinals: This New BRC Standard Could Reduce Inscription Fees By 90% Bitcoin Ordinals, once an emerging player in the crypto market, has now gained significant traction, establishing itself as a potential innovator in the industry. The trading volume of Ordinals has demonstrated a growth trajectory, as detailed in DappRadar’s report. The trading volume for Ordinals started the year modestly, registering a mere $7.18 million in the first quarter. However, as the innovation gained increased visibility and trader confidence, there was an upturn in trading activity. The second quarter of 2023 saw Bitcoin Ordinals’ trading volume skyrocket to $210.7 million, a figure that represents a 2,834% increase from the preceding quarter. This upswing in trading activity underscores its growth in the digital asset market and indicates the potential for continued extension in the quarters to come. It is worth noting that Bitcoin Ordinals’ performance is not a passing trend; instead, it signals a shift in how investors and enthusiasts approach NFTs in the digital assets space. The rising acceptance and trading volume of Bitcoin Ordinals reveals a positive trajectory, which has successfully harnessed the power of non-fungible tokens. Furthermore, Bitcoin Ordinals’ journey from a relatively obscure blockchain project to a formidable player in the NFT space reflects the nature of the digital asset landscape. Its growth narrative, as underscored by its Q2 performance, sets the stage for more innovation and market expansion in the world of nonfungible tokens. User Engagement And Marketplaces Fuel Growth DappRadar’s report also highlighted Bitcoin Ordinals trades in Q2 – over 550,000 – driven by more than 151,000 unique traders. This surge in trading activity attests to its rapidly growing appeal within the crypto community in 2023. Data from a blockchain analytics dashboard on Dune, maintained by @domo, affirm these observations, highlighting a significant rise in individual users beginning in May 2023. Related Reading: Dormant Bitcoin Supply Peaks As Institutional Investors Show Increased Involvement This expansion is mirrored across several trading platforms, where UniSat – an open-source Chrome extension supporting Bitcoin Ordinals & BRC-20 tokens – along with Magic Eden and Ordinals Wallet, commands a substantial share of distinct users.

42419929,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUGh6T,1688747160,Threads Is Libra and Meta All Over Again,"It has been clear for many years now that Mark Zuckerberg, founder and leader of the biggest platforms in Web 2.0, wishes he was spending more time building in the crypto world. Now he’s at it again with Threads, Meta’s new Twitter-like social media app, which is leveraging the growing appeal of decentralization.  We first saw Zuck’s crypto envy with the aborted Libra (Diem) payments token. We saw it again when Zuckerberg made the (still mind-boggling) decision to rename Facebook to Meta, partly inspired by blockchain-backed metaverses. Zuckerberg bet it all on a massive pivot that was obviously doomed to fail, and now definitively has.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Zuck’s third bite at the crypto-adjacent apple might go better than the first two, if only because it’s far less ambitious: like most of Facebook’s successes, Threads is a copy of an existing product. While it’s not integrated yet, Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri says Threads will eventually use the same ActivityPub protocol as the open-source Mastodon system. ActivityPub is a protocol standard under the very mainstream W3C body which offers, among other things, a form of the “data portability” digital activists have long asked of social media services.  The most direct influence on Threads’ backend design may well be BlueSky, Jack Dorsey’s experimental Twitter competitor, which is building its own answer to the ActivityPub protocol, AT Protocol. Dorsey himself was certainly influenced by the push for decentralized social media in the crypto world, going all the way back to the tokenized Steemit circa 2016.  There’s also the recent popularity of Nostr, a competing decentralized social media standard, among Bitcoin types – including Dorsey. And there is (was?) also DeSo, formerly BitClout, a blockchain-backed and tokenized system that has never seen meaningful adoption.  Decentralization isn’t everything  But the idea that Threads is “decentralized” could easily be oversold. For one thing, decentralization on the back-end doesn’t seem like it’s going to stop Meta from doing its very favorite thing: gathering data about users of the front-end Threads app. According to its App Store disclosures, the Threads app gathers the full spectrum of user data, which Meta needs to execute on its targeted-ad business model.  (It’s also revealing that Threads is not launching in Europe yet, likely because European privacy standards are much higher than ours.)  This combination of a decentralized back-end and a data-gathering app out front is an exact parallel to the setup Meta (then Facebook) was pursuing with Libra. Facebook touted the Libra protocol as decentralized – a claim that was itself questionable at best. But most users would have been funneled to a wallet that gathered data just as intensely as Facebook.com.  It’s also unclear exactly how “portable” Threads user data will be in practical terms. Critics have often described Mastodon, another platform that uses the ActivityPub protocol, as extremely clunky and non-intuitive, with moving from one server to another a particular challenge. It would be in Meta’s hands, it seems, to build tools that would make it easy for users to leave Threads, but that doesn’t seem in its financial best interest. And Meta, a publicly traded company, doesn’t do things that aren't in its financial best interest.  It also seems highly unlikely that Threads will become a new home for the discussions and personalities that make up “crypto Twitter.” For one thing, hostility to Meta runs extremely deep in crypto circles, largely thanks to its longstanding indifference to privacy. Because it benefits from spillover from Instagram, one canny analysis also argued that Threads’ audience demographic is “hot and dumb.” Within the digital asset industry, that would leave Dr. Craig Wright a very lonely poster.  Elon Musk: accidental decentralization hero?  None of this would be happening without Elon Musk. Musk’s catastrophic takeover of Twitter, which by one metric has destroyed roughly $30 billion worth of that platform’s enterprise value, has finally convinced a critical mass of people what crypto types have been warning for years: that any user-generated media platform with a single point of control (or in Elon’s case, failure) is bad for users over the long term.  Full disclosure, I’m experiencing this tragedy personally. After more than a decade on Twitter, I finally really started doing numbers over the last couple of years, only to get rug-pulled by Musk. The drumbeat of bad decisions has been ceaseless, from the bizarrely counterproductive rethink of verification to the hostile abuse of trustworthy news sources to the blocking of certain external links.  Musk’s decisions have led to a noticeable exodus of users, notoriously culminating in a view limit imposed last week. The view limit has since been seemingly relaxed, but its announcement became a breaking point for many users. We don’t know the numbers quite yet, but the past week has been a flurry of pre-emptive sad goodbyes and people debating which alternative platform to flee too.  It seems Meta smelled blood in the water and chose its moment to strike. An unnamed Meta executive told employees that “‘We’ve been hearing from creators and public figures who are interested in having a platform that is sanely run,’” according to The Verge. New York Times reporter Mike Isaac has cited internal sources claiming that the launch of Threads was accelerated to capitalize on Musk’s view limit debacle.  Plenty of wags (including me) have joked that Musk’s mismanagement represents a glorious opportunity for obsessive tweeters to throw off the shackles of digital addiction and go touch some grass. If Twitter’s downfall drives home the importance of truly public and decentralized digital infrastructure, that will be an even bigger benefit.  Meta, the Death Star of social media, is by no means the right champion to take that vision to the finish line, but we don’t need them to be. Libra wound up hugely legitimizing crypto technology even as it failed. By the same token, Threads using a decentralized backend is a gargantuan endorsement of the idea, and a major boost to the broader ActivityPub ecosystem, even if most of Threads’ users wind up not caring in the slightest.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,David Z.

But floor price is just one metric used to value NFTs – experts explain that there are other important factors in assessing what an NFT is worth.  Meanwhile, NFT royalty payouts are down this month, as creators, platforms and collectors continue to butt heads over the matter. Plus, Tom Brady’s sports collectibles site Autograph is reportedly in trouble and changing its game plan.  You’re reading The Airdrop, our weekly newsletter where we discuss the biggest stories across Web3. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Friday.  This Week's Alpha  Monkey see, monkey don’t: Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), one of the most popular NFT collections to date, is experiencing a decline in popularity. This week, the collection’s floor price – or a measurement of the lowest price a seller wants for an NFT in a given collection – dipped to a 20-month low of 27.4 ETH, or about $53,000, indicating waning public opinion in the collection at large. This trend has been across the NFT market, as formerly red-hot collections are seeing their floor prices drop. But what does this mean for the largest NFT collection by sales volume?  Overleveraged, underwhelming: My colleague David Z. Morris writes that BAYC’s steep decline is a reflection of how the project catered to an elite, insular community and marketed its NFTs aggressively during the bull market. As the market has cooled, many collectors traded in the community for cash, leaving the project to justify its cultural value add.  Is BAYC over? Far from it, though the floor price drop means that the most basic Apes in the collection cost less, shrinking the bar for entry into the community. There are many factors that contribute to the valuation of NFTs such as rarity traits and cultural significance. In fact, some of the Apes with the rarest traits in the collection (like gold fur) are still valued above 300 ETH, or about $556,000. We dug into what that means for Justin Bieber’s Ape and others.  Royal pain: NFT creators are making less money from secondary sales than they have in two years, according to a report from data analytics platform Nansen. Royalty payments hit their peak in April 2022, reaching 28,000 ETH (nearly $76 million) for creators in one week. Meanwhile, June’s best week saw creators collectively earn 2,000 ETH, or about $3.8 million. As competition amongst NFT marketplaces has heated up, many of the most popular platforms changed their policies on enforcing royalty payments to stay afloat. Two of the largest NFT marketplaces, Blur and OpenSea, went tit-for-tat earlier this year but settled on enforcing a minimum royalty payment of 0.5%. In both cases, collectors have the option to pay more royalties, though it appears that the practice is uncommon.  Blur to blame? Nansen analysts Javier Cerdan and Edward Wilson told CoinDesk that royalties have been declining since February, though the sharp drop has been made worse by the rise of optional royalties popularized by Blur.  Blue-chip stockpile: Despite declining payouts, blue-chip collections have received millions in royalties so far. Yuga Labs, for example, has raked in nearly $166 million in collective royalties across its collections, including Bored Ape Yacht Club, Mutant Ape Yacht Club and Otherdeed for Otherside.  Autograph changes play: NFL star Tom Brady embraced NFTs in 2021, and launched his sports-themed collectibles Autograph platform. According to The New York Times, Brady raised over $200 million from investors and even had FTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried join its board. But in the wake of FTX’s crash, a source told The Times that Autograph’s revenue shrunk, leading it to shift its strategy away from crypto and more towards generic celebrity loyalty programs.  Financial fumble: Autograph has reportedly laid off over 50 employees, signaling financial woes.

Project in the news  HV-MTL  Who: Yuga Labs  What: HV-MTL, pronounced “heavy metal,” is a new crafting game for holders of HV-MTL NFTs, which were released in March. Users are tasked with “creating a forge” for their HV characters, and the community votes on their favorite plot, earning rewards for its creator. As the game evolves in the coming month, new challenges will be introduced to test a user’s skill.  How: The “forge” experience for HV-MTL opened last week and will last for six seasons lasting three weeks each. The full experience is currently only available to HV-MTL NFT holders, though non-holders will soon be able to try a limited version of the game. Unfortunately, this news has not helped boost HV-MTLs price or the overall vibe for Yuga Labs. To date, the HV-MTL collection has done 34,196 ETH (about $63.5 million) in trading volume, and its floor price sits at 0.64 ETH (about $1,180) at the time of writing, which is far from its peak of around 2 ETH when it debuted.

Non-Fungible Toolkit  How Scammers Drain Your Crypto Wallet  One kind of attack on the rise is ‘ice phishing,’ which tricks a victim into signing a malicious blockchain transaction that opens access to the victim’s wallet so the attacker can steal all the money.  More commonly, people who get hacked aren’t the target of sophisticated exploits but instead fall prey to scammer’s use of social engineering.

Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Make High Deposits For 20 Straight Days According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, the short-term holders have sent 617,000 BTC to exchanges during the past 20 days. The “short-term holders” (STHs) here refer to Bitcoin investors who have been holding onto their coins since less than 155 days ago. The STHs are generally the less experienced hands of the market, who may easily sell during periods of widespread FUD in the market, or during sharp surges in the cryptocurrency’s price. Usually, these investors make use of exchanges for participating in such selloffs, so the data for their “exchange inflows” can provide hints about their current behavior. The exchange inflow here naturally refers to the total amount of Bitcoin that the STHs are depositing to the wallets of centralized exchanges. When the value of this metric is high, it can be a sign that these holders are selling a large number of coins currently. Naturally, such a trend may have bearish consequences for the asset’s price. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin exchange inflow for these STHs over the past year or so: Looks like the value of the metric seems to have been relatively high in recent days | Source: Glassnode on Twitter Here, the Bitcoin STH exchange inflows are represented in terms of the percentage of their supply. As the supply of these investors can change, it makes more sense to consider the percentage of it as it would make comparisons with history easier (the pure figures, on the other hand, may be incompatible). From the graph, it’s visible that the Bitcoin STH exchange inflows have been elevated recently. During the last 20 days, these investors’ inflows have measured above 1% of their supply. Related Reading: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink Says Bitcoin Is Digital Gold, So What’s The Digital Silver? In this period, the cohort has deposited a total of about 617,000 BTC ($18.6 billion at the current exchange rate) to these platforms, which is quite a significant amount. In the chart, Glassnode has also highlighted the previous instances during the last year or so where the indicator crossed the same threshold of 1%. It looks like in terms of the magnitude of the inflow spikes, the three capitulation periods that followed the LUNA collapse, 3AC bankruptcy, and FTX crash, respectively, saw larger peaks than the recent levels. The duration of the latest period of elevated exchange inflow activity from the Bitcoin STHs, however, has been quite extraordinary, as it has gone on for at least 20 days so far. Whereas the aforementioned capitulation selloffs only lasted for 13 days each. Related Reading: Glassnode Co-Founder Predicts Bull Run For Bitcoin Amidst Sideways Trading Nevertheless, despite the high selling pressure from this cohort, It would appear that the price of the cryptocurrency has been holding strong thus far, as it’s still floating above the $30,000 level.

42419925,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUGh4P,1688742387,Gemini Sues Digital Currency Group and Founder Barry Silbert Alleging 'Fraud',"Crypto trust firm Gemini sued Digital Currency Group on Friday, alleging the industry conglomerate and its founder Barry Silbert committed ""fraud"" through DCG subsidiary Genesis, which held funds for Gemini tied to the latter company's Earn program.  The lawsuit is intended to recover Gemini's funds from DCG, a filing made to the New York County Supreme Court said. Gemini entered into a partnership with Genesis which allowed its customers to earn up to 7.4% in annual percentage yield. Gemini sent its customers' funds to Genesis, which in turn loaned them out to companies like the now-defunct Three Arrows Capital. Like Genesis, CoinDesk is a subsidiary of DCG.  ""From the beginning, Genesis – acting in concert with Defendants and with Defendants’ active support and encouragement – induced the Gemini Earn Lenders to lend by touting Genesis’s purportedly robust risk-management practices and a supposedly thorough vetting process of the counterparties to which it re-lent the assets,"" the filing said. ""Those were lies.""  The lawsuit alleges that Silbert asked Gemini to continue its Earn program even though he ""was aware at the time that Genesis was massively insolvent,"" and took other steps to hide that Genesis had a billion-dollar hole on its balance sheet. Genesis filed for bankruptcy in January 2023.  The filing took aim at DCG's announcement that it had absorbed the Three Arrows Capital losses, saying this was ""false.""  The filing also said that Genesis had not honored redemption requests since mid-November.  In a tweet, Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss, who previously invited Silbert to join him on a Twitter Space without lawyers, called Silbert ""the architect and mastermind of the DCG and Genesis fraud against creditors.""  The lawsuit, which alleges fraud and aiding and abetting fraud, is seeking damages, attorney's fees and ""any other relief that is deemed just and proper.""  In a tweet of its own, DCG said the allegations were ""defamatory"" and called the filing a ""publicity stunt.""  ""Senior DCG leadership has been working around the clock over the course of multiple months in active negotiation with representatives of the Official Unsecured Creditors Committee and Ad Hoc Committee to reach a deal while Gemini's leadership was MIA [missing in action] or only issuing press statements,"" the tweet said.  Gemini and Genesis also both face a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit over the Gemini Earn product. The lawsuit, filed in January, alleged that Gemini Earn was an unregistered securities offering.  UPDATE (July 7, 2023, 15:45 UTC): Adds additional detail.

Ethereum Network Growth Has Registered High Values Recently According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, ETH’s network growth has now hit its highest level in around four months. The “network growth” here refers to a metric that keeps track of the total amount of new addresses that are being created on the Ethereum blockchain. When the value of this metric is high, it means that a large amount of new addresses are coming online on the network. New addresses may be considered analogous to new users joining the chain, so this kind of trend can be a sign that the cryptocurrency is observing high adoption at the moment. On the other hand, low values of the indicator can imply not many new investors are coming to the network as there aren’t many new ETH addresses being created. Such a trend can be a sign that the asset isn’t looking very attractive to the general public currently. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Ethereum network growth over the last few months: Looks like the value of the metric has been quite high in recent days | Source: Santiment on Twitter As displayed in the above graph, the Ethereum network growth has been observing a rise recently. This would suggest that addresses are being created at increasingly faster rates right now. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Supply Continues To Slip, Holders Not Interested In Selling? Generally, adoption picks up during periods of high price volatility as the investors usually find such price action exciting, and so, the network growth indicator can register a spike. Recently, however, the asset’s price has been mostly moving sideways below the $1,900 level, making it interesting that the indicator has been going up nonetheless. Perhaps the general investors saw the rally that lead up to this period of consolidation and now think that it may pick up again eventually. During the past week alone, the metric has seen a combined value of 550,800, meaning that 550,800 new addresses have just been created on the Ethereum network in this period. Usually, adoption can have a constructive effect on the cryptocurrency’s price, as it shows increasing interest in the asset, which is generally also accompanied by an influx of more capital into the coin. Related Reading: Solana Registers 20% Rise In Past Week, But Can SOL Keep This Up? Though, the impact from such a growth in the network doesn’t usually immediately appear; the effect on the cryptocurrency’s market cap may be visible in the long term. Still, the adoption accelerating while the rally has slowed down to a crawl can be a positive for those hoping to see the price surge restart, as it at least means that interest in the asset hasn’t died down yet. ETH Price At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $1,800, down 1% in the last week.

The hype caused by Blackrock Once it was announced that the biggest asset manager in the world (Blackrock) had filed for a Spot Bitcoin ETF, the whole crypto market was thrown into a frenzy of hope and optimism that this would be the spark that ignites the next crypto bull run. There is no bigger player than Blackrock, and add to this the pro-crypto and bitcoin comments made by its CEO Larry Fink on national TV, and you have the perfect narrative to help the crypto market explode higher. Bitcoin spot ETF is anathema to banks Such a scenario is absolute anathema to the commercial banking system. Should institutions and the average retail investor get the message that bitcoin is worth investing in, and given the parlous state of the US dollar and all other fiat currencies, a trickle of crypto buying could become an avalanche. JP Morgan report attempts damage limitation The line taken by strategists in the JP Morgan report that was released on Thursday is that the Blackrock ETF “is unlikely to be a game changer for crypto markets”. One of the main arguments for this was that Spot Bitcoin ETFs already exist in Canada and Europe, yet have not gained a significant amount of investor interest. Another avenue of reasoning that was explored by the report was that in the JP Morgan view, a Spot ETF had only “marginal” benefits over a Futures ETF. While some advantages of a Spot ETF were laid out, the only real ‘disadvantage’ appeared to be that a Spot ETF could potentially take trading activity and liquidity away from the already existent Futures ETFs Given that a Bitcoin Futures ETF is really more for institutional use than it is for retail investors, this surely can’t be seen as an argument against the Spot ETF. In traditional finance both types of ETF exist and they are used as tools for different types of investor activity. Opinion Even as JP Morgan tries to influence markets against any activity that might promote interest or further buying into bitcoin products, they must surely be seeing the writing on the wall. CEO Jamie Dimon is still making his “pet rock” references to bitcoin, but as influential as he might be in financial circles, this kind of ridiculous name-calling is starting to become embarrassing for him. JP Morgan is after all an institution that is there to make money, and staying out of such a potentially game-changing asset as bitcoin could be financial suicide. Granted there is probably a lot of pressure to follow this line by the Biden Administration, perhaps with promises of more tasty regional banks to be thrown at JP Morgan when they fail, to be gobbled up with relish, but how long can it stay out of what can become an alternative asset that can potentially be worth trillions?

14618537,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=541720,1688736611,When Will Bitcoin Rocket To The Moon? Price Analysis,"In the Bitcoin space, one question echoes persistently through the minds of enthusiasts and investors alike: When will Bitcoin rocket to the moon? While no one knows the answer, there are on-chain metrics and historical patterns that can be followed to track down the answer. Bitcoin Price Analysis: When Will BTC Break Out? Over the last two weeks, the Bitcoin price has been in a sideways trend. After the Bitcoin bulls were able to turn the tide at $24,900, the price has risen by more than 25%. Since then, however, BTC has been trading in the range between $29.800 and $31.300. Neither bulls nor bears have been able to gain the upper hand and break out of the trading range in higher time frames. The renowned crypto trader and analyst “Rekt Capital” believes that all it takes is a positive catalyst to current BTC price action. According to him, Bitcoin’s current sideways trend within a tight range is a mere step away from its ultimate demise. He affirms that “a BTC downtrend is only ever one positive catalyst away from ending. And a BTC uptrend is always one negative catalyst from ending”, adding: BTC has performed a bullish Monthly close but is primed for a healthy technical retest at ~$29250. With price currently around $30200… I wonder what negative catalyst will soon emerge to facilitate this technical retest. On-chain analyst Axel Adler Jr echoes this view and points to BTC total transfer volume as indicator for a massive breakout move. While the exact timing remains elusive, Adler Jr suggests that the moonshot could be triggered by a significant event such as the approval of a Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). Related Reading: Dormant Bitcoin Supply Peaks As Institutional Investors Show Increased Involvement Drawing from historical evidence, Adler Jr highlights the correlation between explosive price pumps and a surge in BTC’s total transfer volume. Past instances, like the dramatic surges witnessed in February 2019 and August 2020, lend weight to the argument that a similar surge may loom just around the corner. Bulls Vs. Bears And Whale Games Daan Crypto Trades remarks on the current state of the market, “They call this candlestick pattern: Thanks for your stops.” Daan’s keen eye eagerly awaits a decisive breakthrough that will propel Bitcoin into a significant move. Related Reading: Glassnode Co-Founder Predicts Bull Run For Bitcoin Amidst Sideways Trading As the battle between bulls and bears ensues, he perceives the ongoing range-bound activity as a prelude to an imminent explosion. “Until then it’s just a lot of chop, stop hunts and liquidity grabs until one side comes out victorious.” Once the shackles of this consolidation are shattered, Daan predicts that the resulting breakout will mark the top for 2023: If BTC were to grind back to the highs from here, I’d be pretty confident that the next breakout will be the one where we finally break out of this area. I also think this would be the sharpest move and likely sets the top for 2023 followed by a slow rest of the year. I would assume we’d visit approximately 36-40K in a quick fashion. Meanwhile, renowned analyst Skew shed light on the intricacies of Bitcoin’s market dynamics. With an eagle eye on the Binance Spot market, Skew discerns substantial BTC accumulation occurring. He revealed that the supply is concentrated between $31.3K and $32K, while demand persists between $29.5K and $28K. Unveiling the tactics of bigger players, Skew pointed to how whales employ aggressive short positions to manipulate the price within the narrow hourly range, exploiting bid liquidity and supply.

Cancun, Audit, Then V4 The Uniswap Foundation recently put forth an announcement elaborating its plans for the much-awaited Uniswap v4 protocol. Although the foundation’s Governance Lead, Erin Koen, has disclosed that the launch is scheduled for later this year, the fact is that a lot depends on the successful deployment of Ethereum’s upcoming Cancun upgrade, which is scheduled to go live around the end of September. Uniswap v4 will also require thorough auditing before it goes live, a process that can only start after Cancun and can take as long as one to four months. V4 To Reinvent Uniswap The v4 launch will bring forth a major reinvention for the Uniswap platform, which is already the largest decentralized exchange protocol. One of the most noteworthy changes that will be incorporated will be “hooks” or smart contracts that can enable additional customization of the protocol’s liquidity pools to create a more modular exchange structure through features like dynamic fees, on-chain limit orders, and tailored on-chain oracles. Another revolutionary feature that is to be incorporated with the v4 launch is a “flash accounting” system, which will reduce fees for liquidity providers and is being predicted to contribute significantly to gas savings. This mechanism leverages ""transient storage,"" which will be activated by the proposed EIP-1153 change in Ethereum's protocol, set to be integrated during Cancun. Additionally, in contrast to the v3 model, which involved transferring assets into and out of pools after each swap, the new method will only transfer net balances. Roadmap For V4 For now, the next “protocol code frozen” stage will focus on incorporating the EIP-1153 into the protocol code for the next version. Ideally, the EIP-1153 will be successfully integrated into Etheruem’s Cancun upgrade, which will allow the Uniswap Foundation to roll out the v4 protocol. Koen has claimed that the foundation will not be rushing the process and instead take the necessary time to do due diligence and ensure the integrity of the Uniswap ecosystem and user safety. Therefore v4 launch will only go ahead after the necessary parameters are satisfied. The Ethereum community is eagerly anticipating the upcoming Cancun upgrade, fueling even more excitement for the potential advancements in the next version of Uniswap. This pivotal moment holds great significance for the DeFi space, as these developments have the potential to reshape the industry and reinvent decentralized exchanges.

Predictions include whether regulators will approve a Bitcoin spot ETF and how the halving event will affect crypto prices. The analysts revealed their top picks, which miners and ETFs are worth investing in, and how they'd build a crypto portfolio from scratch. We’ve passed the midpoint of the year, and it’s the perfect time to look ahead to how the rest of 2023 will play out. In June, Seeking Alpha convened a roundtable of crypto analysts to assess the impact of the Fed’s rate pause decision on cryptos. Now, we’re back with a panel of analysts to ponder the big questions about the state of crypto in 2023 as well as the critical issues that will shape its future. Will the SEC regulate cryptos? Will the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( GBTC ) win approval to convert to an ETF? What price will Bitcoin (BTC-USD) hit by year-end? How significant is Bitcoin’s halving next year? Which is the best miner to invest in? What percentage of an investor’s portfolio should be in cryptos? What’s the top crypto pick for 2023? We’ll explore all these topics and more, but first, let’s introduce our analysts: Clem Chambers is CEO of blockchain research and development incubator Online Blockchain plc. Mike Fay is an independent analyst with a focus on Bitcoin, miners, and various digital assets. Kevin George focuses on stocks, cryptos, FX, and commodities. Logan Kane covers cyptos, gold, macroeconomic trends, portfolio strategy, value investing, and behavioral finance. Kennan Mell uses his expertise as a software engineer to analyze the use cases for cryptos. And John Miller has a background in economics and often focuses on the impact of the Fed and SEC on cryptos. What is your top crypto pick for 2023? Logan Kane : My top crypto pick for 2023 is the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). I believe Bitcoin is the only game in town for crypto, and that the unique circumstances of GBTC make GBTC the best way to play Bitcoin. Mike Fay: My top crypto pick for 2023 was Polygon (MATIC-USD) back in December of 2022. Given the recent news that the SEC believes that coin is an unregistered security, the YTD performance has not been what I'd hoped at the start of the year. While I personally view Polygon as more of a digital commodity since it's a gas token on the Proof of Stake chain, I view recent weakness as a buying opportunity. Polygon may not finish the year where it started, but I imagine it will close out the year well ahead of these recent lows. Kennan Mell: Bitcoin is my top crypto pick for 2023. While Ethereum (ETH-USD) has the potential to eventually surpass Bitcoin as my top pick, we need regulatory clarity on whether it's a commodity before that can happen. I think that it would be foolish to make any other coin my top pick considering the tendency of most altcoins to die off once their hype fades. John Miller: Top idea for the next six months: Bitcoin-adjacent names with an angle, like Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust or a basket of miners. Clem Chambers: I like Presearch (PRE-USD) because it has a solid product that works and it’s lowly valued. I’ve tucked some away, but this is a pure punt. Kevin George: Investors should look at projects that are offering a service and operating similar to a stock. Consider the market cap of the project, and what it could become with corporate adoption. What do you foresee as the biggest event for the rest of 2023 that will affect investors? Kennan Mell: The event that would have the largest impact on my crypto investment strategy is a verdict in the SEC's lawsuits that clarifies which cryptocurrencies are securities. If Ethereum is ruled a commodity, I would be comfortable allocating a larger part of my portfolio to Ethereum, as regulatory risk is the biggest issue that I see facing Ethereum today. However, we may not be fortunate enough to get a final verdict on this in 2023. Clem Chambers: It’s all about the SEC. There is only one call: Do they want to regulate crypto, or kill it? So, benchmarking what happens next will clarify the choice, and that is key for the short and medium term for crypto, in the U.S. at least. Mike Fay: For Bitcoin, the biggest catalyst is a potential dovish Fed pivot, in my opinion. Bitcoin is well-positioned as the ""inflation-hedge"" crypto given its supply cap and stock-to-flow ratio. As for Ethereum and many of the alts, I think investors need to keep an eye on the SEC, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and any crypto-related bills that may pop up in Congress. The early June performances of Solana (SOL-USD), Polygon, and Cardano (ADA-USD) have made it quite clear that the market doesn't want these things labeled unregistered securities by the SEC. Logan Kane : The biggest story in crypto this year in terms of making money as an investor will likely be the GBTC conversion case. There's a ruling in the case expected sometime in the third quarter of this year, and GBTC is trading at around a 30% discount to net asset value as of my last look. The way that works out is you get a great return on your money if the appeals court allows GBTC to convert to an ETF, which the court has shown some willingness to potentially allow. There's downside too, if the court denies the appeal, but activist activity around GTBC means that the lower it goes, the more pressure will be ramped up on the company to correct the discount. Kevin George: I think Binance could be the spark for another bear move. it is the largest exchange by a factor of around 10X trading volume. With the Binance Coin (BNB-USD) near the 2022 lows, a break lower could worsen the company's balance sheet and solvency. John Miller: With regulatory battles heating up, nothing may be more important than the Ripple (XRP-USD) litigation . On the merits, Ripple looks to score a big win for the space by demonstrating the inadequacy of the Howey Test in application to the crypto industry. The arguments are nuanced, but the court may find that current XRP trades do not implicate securities laws, and that Ripple was not given fair notice of the law due to regulatory confusion. The upshot being increased ease of access and trade for coins and tokens that are not classified as securities. Where do you see the price of Bitcoin at the end of 2023? Kevin George: I think it will test $20,000 again. As we saw in 2022, a bearish move can take time to reverse. Clem Chambers: I still haven’t given up on $13,000, but the most likely answer is $25,000. The way Bitcoin is riding out the regulatory disaster zone, almost any price sub-$100,000 is possible, but I remain a bear sitting out this crazy dance. John Miller: Highest probability scenario is a volatile rise into the halving event early next year, with an April/May target of $35,000. So my year-end estimate is ~$30,000. Mike Fay: I don't usually like giving price forecasts, but I assume by the end of the year we'll have already seen the Fed stop hiking rates. Provided there isn't some sort of black swan event that specifically impacts Bitcoin (very possible), I don't see why Bitcoin shouldn't be trading closer to $35,000. The question is do we get one final washout down to $20,000-21,000 from our current $26,000 level before that happens? I suspect it may happen. How significant is the Bitcoin Halving event next year, and how will it affect Bitcoin’s price? Kevin George: It's significant because it changes the reward structure for Bitcoin mining and will change the outlook for mining firms. There will likely be some form of speculative positioning ahead of the event, but where that starts from depends largely on the SEC with cases against Ripple, Grayscale and the two largest exchanges. Mike Fay: History shows the halving is followed by a new all-time high within 12 to 18 months. I see no reason why that won't be the same this time around provided there isn't a global coordinated effort by governments to destroy the mining sector. So long as there is demand for a decentralized payment network that can't be controlled or manipulated by central actors, the coin will have value and the miners will have a home somewhere. Kennan Mell: Historically, Bitcoin's price has been tightly correlated with its halving cycle, and the months leading up to the halving event are typically bullish. Halving is also bullish from a fundamental perspective because it decreases the amount of new Bitcoin being created. Granted, each successive halving event has less impact than the last; the block reward going from 50 to 25 would be much more significant in absolute terms than if it goes from 6 to 3, for example. Clem Chambers: It’s the key event. Bitcoin is not going away in the US, at least not until the exchanges are shuttered and the off ramps barricaded. Then the next takedown is EVM chains like Ethereum, because it has names attached to shackle. By then crypto will be gone from the US anyway but it will still flourish in many parts of the world that need a crypto or want a thriving new tech engine of growth and productivity. John Miller: The highest probability outcome is that positive sentiment and positive expectations surrounding the halving event drive price action over the next year. With a basic balance and equilibrium in both the regulation battles and interest rate policy effects, I expect strong, though not parabolic, increases in digital asset prices into the Bitcoin halving. Speaking of sentiment, how would you assess investor sentiment toward cryptos? John Miller: Broad sentiment is currently mixed, up from negative. I am operating under the assumption the current cycle is in a denouement phase, following the recent bull and bear phases. Historically digital assets are best invested in during times of negative sentiment; so now is the time to insure full investment and begin to rebalance toward medium risk names. Put simply and differently, buy dips over the coming months with a goal of not chasing the rally into the Bitcoin halving later in the year. Mike Fay: I think investor sentiment is split into two categories. The retail investors who have stuck around since FTX seem less concerned than the institutional investors. The latter of which have been exiting the market judging by the 8 consecutive weeks of crypto fund outflows as of mid-June. For retail, market sentiment indicators that I follow suggest the fear isn't as extreme as price may be suggesting. Kevin George: I think strong adoption into DeFi was reversed by central bank rate hikes. The money showed that it was fluid and went to the safety of government investments, or FDIC-insured savings. The Terra issue and FTX then added further damage to institutional appetite and I don't think the recent SEC comments on Binance are helpful. Only when the regulators clean up the structures of exchanges would large investment increase. Clem Chambers: If you judged sentiment by the price of Bitcoin you would have to say it is jubilant. If you look to the US crackdown by the SEC on crypto you might say it was investors behaving like partyers on the Titanic after it has hit the iceberg. Which (if any) of the crypto miners do you see as the best investment? Kennan Mell: I wouldn't invest in any crypto miner, a view that I first shared in 2021 before Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) fell 73%. Crypto miners have far too much counterparty risk and have yet to prove that they can be consistently profitable outside of bull markets. Historically, miners have underperformed the cryptos they mine. John Miller: Bitfarms’ ( BITF ) production relative to its enterprise value is a major bargain. Possible regulatory effects in Canada and Argentina are a negative. But Bitfarms has top class, experienced and conservative management. Mike Fay: My biggest personal allocation at this time is to Riot Platforms but I do have a position in other miners as well. I think Riot has the right mix of large Bitcoin stack, low debt load, and the high EH/s capacity. But to be clear, I'm not really sold any of these companies are great long-term investments unless transaction fees permanently become a meaningful portion of the block reward. Kevin George: I would avoid large miners such as Riot. The company has built a big facility but there are hints of miners moving some mining abroad to a less-intense regulatory structure. It would not be possible for large miners to move their plants and they will have to sit it out and absorb the recent 30% tax announced by the Biden admin. Clem Chambers: I can’t like miners outside of moments when crypto goes vertical. Then everything’s good. However, when you look at the depreciation of mining hardware as its mining potency plummets and the mining difficulty function increases, the expensive equipment has a short commercial life. This leaves me failing to understand how miners can get a sustainable business from their large capital investments unless there is a need to make cash disappear at location X and Bitcoin reappear in location Y. This has a big value to some of course but only to the dark side. Outside of those kinds of opportunities I don’t see how the economics make sense unless the business has hidden variables. For 2023, are there any crypto/blockchain-related ETFs worth considering in terms of portfolio allocation? Clem Chambers: If the SEC doesn’t want them, I don’t want them. I’m bored with ETFs that don’t track and aren’t true to the ideal of an ETF. The SEC would do well to clean that Augean stable rather than monkey with crypto… but of course that industry doesn’t threaten fiat or insist on insulting government. Mike Fay: I'm not a huge fan of crypto ETFs for several reasons. There really aren't many that can even be considered and the ones that I've looked at have significant exposure to companies that I don't think are going to survive long term. I think investors are better off doing the work and picking the individual stocks themselves or with their advisors. Kevin George: I believe there is better upside potential in crypto projects than the current listed companies. Kennan Mell: I think it's preferable for investors to hold cryptocurrencies rather than crypto ETFs at this point. Most crypto ETFs have high exposure to crypto miners, which so far have given us nothing but questionable business models and terrible investment returns. Although the article is somewhat dated, I wrote more about blockchain ETFs last year. How will the Treasury’s outsized bond sales to replenish its coffers impact crypto prices? John Miller: Treasury’s outsized bond sales is a non-event. Theoretically this could raise rates and be a headwind for risk-on assets. But I am operating under the assumption we saw the local top in Treasury yields in October. Look for sideways trading in a channel at the current, slightly lower, rate levels until the core PCE inflation indicator meaningfully moves toward 3%. Clem Chambers: Liquidity up, crypto up. Liquidity down, crypto down. It’s worth realizing that interest rates do not need to affect liquidity, nor do bond sales. The Treasury basically sells bonds to itself anyway because the Fed and its proxies are buyers of last, and often first, resort and the Federal Reserve is the government. That’s how you get exploding money supply and inflation. The Treasury replenishes its coffers with a minute or two of typing at a keyboard. Whether that is linked to inflationary or deflationary monetary policy is a separate matter dictated by economic and political necessity. Kevin George: Significant buying of Treasury bonds will support yields and the U.S. dollar. Both are a negative for crypto. Mike Fay: That could certainly be seen as a potential headwind for crypto but I'd wager the impact will be less on Bitcoin than it is for traditional equities. Bitcoin is global. And there is clearly a motivation outside of the US to de-dollarized. There will be a bid for Bitcoin somewhere. The reality is Bitcoin was designed to be a new system of peer-to-peer payment outside of the old rails, and with clearly defined rules about inflation rates and supply. That's appealing to a lot of people and even sovereign nations as we've seen from El Salvador. What percentage of an investor’s portfolio should be in cryptos? If readers wanted to invest $10,000, what coins or crypto-related securities should they consider? Mike Fay: With the caveat that I'm not an investment advisor, my feel is that allocation to crypto should probably come down to how close an individual investor is to retirement. The closer to retirement, the less I'd personally speculate in crypto or blockchain tech. I'm 36, and I have about 10% of my liquid investable capital in crypto. That 10% breaks out to roughly 40% Bitcoin, 20% Ethereum, and then the rest is spread out over a couple dozen altcoins that I believe have high upside potential and ecosystem importance. Those include cryptocurrencies like Polygon, Thorchain (RUNE-USD), ZCash (ZEC-USD), The Graph (GRT-USD), and ChainLink (LINK-USD). Kevin George: Investors should be looking to put 5% in cryptos maybe. But they should avoid established tokens such as Bitcoin and even Ethereum. Also, avoid stablecoins. Staking can earn a yield, but U.S. [bank savings] deposits are backed by the FDIC and can't lose. Most importantly, China and the U.S, the world's two largest economies, have shown that they believe CBDC is the answer. Avoid any crypto that only wants to be a currency. They have depleted investors' funds for 5 years. John Miller: A good rule of thumb is no more than 15% of a portfolio should be in digital assets; plan for substantially less based on portfolio objective and size of other alternative holdings. A $10,000 portfolio for Investors without a digital marketplace account or with self-custody concerns: $2,000 ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO); shift to spot ETF when approved. $1,000 Grayscale Bitcoin Trust; safe, on-chain, at 35% discount, tax issues. $2,500 Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF (WGMI); too heavy on Marathon Platforms (MARA), but otherwise strong weightings. $2,500 Ethereum, purchased through PayPal: safe, on-chain, but admittedly high fees for both buy and sell. $500 Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE): safe, on-chain, at 55% discount, but tax issues. $1,000 Coinbase (COIN): tested, high trust, U.S.-based, strong CEO, plus major FUD discount. $500 Cash. Clem Chambers: If they don’t know, it should be zero. Crypto is an investment buzzsaw. You shouldn’t switch it on unless you know exactly what you are doing. Logan Kane : There's no right or wrong answer to how much to invest in crypto, but you shouldn't invest so much that you lose the ability to have a diversified portfolio. Rather than thinking of it as a fixed percentage of your portfolio, it may be helpful to think about crypto investments in dollar terms. Crypto is a high-risk, high-reward investment, and investors shouldn't invest more money than they're comfortable losing. For any amount of crypto investment, it's painfully clear that you need to ensure the cybersecurity of your investment. Using a regulated onshore brokerage, using two-factor authentification, and taking every recommended precaution with crypto is a must if you're not getting exposure through an ETF. Personally, I think if you have $10,000 to invest in crypto and can afford to lose most of it, I would put it all in GBTC, selling to collect the profit if the court rules in favor and the discount is erased.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4615615-crypto-roundtable-top-picks-for-2023-bitcoin-price-year-end-halving-impact-more?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/14617735.jpeg

May's job gain was originally reported as 339,000.  The unemployment rate dipped to 3.6% in June versus 3.7% in May and against expectations for 3.7%.  The price of bitcoin (BTC) rose modestly to $30,250 in the immediate aftermath of the report's release.  The news comes about 24 hours after the ADP's blowout jobs report for June – 497,000 jobs added versus 220,000 expected – sent interest rates sharply higher and bitcoin tumbling about $1,000, or more than 3%.  Though only a small headline miss, this morning's employment report is notable for breaking an unprecedented streak of 14 consecutive months of topping expectations.  Digging further into the report details, the labor force participation rate held steady for the fourth straight month at 62.6%. Average hourly earnings rose 0.4% in June, topping estimates for 0.3%. On a year-over-year basis, average hourly earnings were higher by 4.4%, steady from May but ahead of estimates for 4.2%.  In addition to the 33,000 downward revision to May's job gains, April's job adds were revised lower by 77,000 to 217,000. In total, revisions subtracted 110,000 jobs from the April and May reports.  While there's plenty of economic data still to come in July, today's release marks the last national employment report before the Federal Reserve's late July interest rate policy meeting. Prior to these latest numbers, markets were pricing in a near-certainty of the central bank resuming rate hikes at that meeting.  The rate of inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) has fallen from a peak of 9.1% in 2022 to the current 4.0%, but it remains well above the Fed's 2% target. Additionally, core CPI – which strips out volatile food and energy costs – has been more stubborn, with the current rate of 5.3% down far more modestly from its peak of 6.6% last year.  The central bank has made clear its belief that a more sluggish employment picture is necessary for bringing inflation under control, but to this point the jobs picture has remained strong.

Park disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had initiated an investigation into BarnBridge DAO and individuals associated with it. In an effort to mitigate potential legal liabilities, Park advised that all work on BarnBridge-related products, including the closure of liquidity pools, should cease. Additionally, he suggested that individuals should not receive compensation for their contributions resulting from the DAO’s investment activities. Shortly after Park’s message, co-founder Tyler Ward, also known as ‘Lord Tyler‘ on Discord, confirmed the accuracy of the information on BarnBridge’s Discord platform. While the reason behind the SEC’s probe into BarnBridge DAO was not explicitly explained by Park and Ward, Park clarified that due to the investigation being ongoing and non-public, only limited information could be shared at this time. Related Reading: Ripple vs SEC: No Money For Years, XRP Holders Lose If SEC Wins, Says John Deaton Speculations Arise Among DAO Members In Response To Announcement Following the announcement, a number of BarnBridge DAO members expressed skepticism regarding the SEC’s investigation. One member on the Discord platform requested substantiating evidence of the SEC’s involvement and insinuated that BarnBridge’s founders might be using the investigation as a pretext for orchestrating an ‘exit strategy’ that could potentially defraud investors. Tyler Ward, however, dismissed this claim, asserting that it would be the “worst thought-out rug attempt in history,” implying that such intentions were baseless. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Takes A Hit As SEC Deems Spot ETF Filings ‘Inadequate’ Some members adopted a more light-hearted approach to the news, with one suggesting that it was time to relocate to Europe, humorously implying that DAO members could potentially evade scrutiny from the SEC. Another member playfully remarked that anyone who had engaged with BarnBridge would face dire consequences, jesting that SEC Chair Gary Gensler would ‘shoot’ them on live television, alluding to Gensler’s perceived strict stance on cryptocurrencies. The Impact Of SEC Lawsuits On BarnBridge Native Crypto And Previous SEC Lawsuits Following the emergence of the news about the investigation, the native token of BarnBridge, BOND, experienced a decline of 9.4%, with its price dropping to $3.02, CoinGecko shows. BOND is now down 98.3% from its all-time high of $185.7 on October 27, 2020, and presently has a market cap of only $28 million. This is not the only time the regulator is coming for crypto firms as the SEC recently made news for launching litigation against two leading industry exchanges, Binance and Coinbase, for purportedly providing unregistered securities. The reported investigation into BarnBridge, a DAO of moderate size, may indicate that the securities regulator is extending its scrutiny beyond the larger entities within the cryptocurrency space. This development raises questions about the breadth of the SEC’s focus within the industry.

Leshner recently announced his plan to launch Superstate Trust, a new business venture. The creation of a short-term government bond fund is the goal of this endeavor. Notably, Superstate Trust has already raised $4 million in startup money from a variety of DeFi investors. Compound (COMP), the native token of Compound Finance, is still on the rise despite Leshner’s resignation. COMP, which is currently trading at $55.87, has experienced a spectacular rise in value of 22.47% over the last two days.

This outstanding performance demonstrates Compound’s (COMP) robustness and adaptability in the face of organizational changes and reflects increased investor trust in the token’s potential. Compound (COMP) token soars after CEO quits. Source: The Defiant Terminal Compound supporters believe that recent significant cryptocurrency ownership outflows by important market participants are clear signs that the price of Compound (COMP) will continue to rise. These backers are optimistic that Compound and its chances for future growth are looking good thanks to the withdrawals made by crypto whales, who own substantial sums of digital assets. Bullish investors predict Compound may even surpass the remarkable valuation of about $80 in the upcoming weeks as a result. This upbeat attitude is based on the idea that these powerful players’ withdrawal activities reveal their trust and confidence in Compound’s long-term potential, acting as a catalyst for the stock’s upward trend. COMP market cap currently at $431 million. Chart: TradingView.com The Superstate assets will have the chance to be represented on the Ethereum blockchain, claims a prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The prospectus stressed the use of blockchain technology and the advantages of “operational efficiencies” that come with it. On the Ethereum blockchain, Compound is a protocol for an algorithmic money market. In particular, the current DeFi craze is ascribed to this network for initiating it. In the middle of the summer of 2020, Compound was the first platform to introduce yield farming to the market. In many ways, yield farming is comparable to staking cryptocurrency.

42419937,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUGhEj,1688731200,"Avail, Spun Out of Polygon, Launches Data Attestation Bridge to Ethereum","Avail, a project that was spun out of Polygon earlier this year to handle data storage and verification for blockchains, launched the ""data attestation bridge"" on its live testnet on Friday, a new offering designed to reduce costs for layer 2 and layer 3 chains in the Ethereum ecosystem.  The data attestation bridge, which is still in its testnet phase, helps secure data off-chain. It’s connected to Ethereum, and can be used by both zero-knowledge and optimistic rollups that use Ethereum as a base layer.  Storing data on Ethereum can be expensive, so Avail aims to be a solution for layer 2s and 3s to publish data off-chain, to reduce the high transaction fees that often come from posting data on the main Ethereum blockchain. The idea is to spare the main Ethereum blockchain from getting congested with anything besides execution and settlement activities.  The challenge of handling the data and setting up separate networks for data storage is known as the ”data availability problem,” or DA – an arena that includes developing cryptographic systems to prove that the data exists (i.e. that it's available) and that it’s right.  “The data attestation bridge establishes a direct connection between the L2 rollup’s data and the L1 via Avail’s off-chain data availability layer,” Avail said in a press release.  The bridge is one component of what Avail will offer in the layer 2 ecosystem. In the longer term, Avail wants rollups to launch entirely on top of its network. These networks could include so-called validiums, which are Ethereum scaling solutions that store transaction data off-chain.  “When an L3 or a validium sends the transaction data to Avail, the data attestation bridge provides the attestation on Ethereum,” Anurag Arjun, the founder of Avail, told CoinDesk. This then proves to Ethereum that “whatever data was submitted by the rollup to Avail is actually available.”  In March, Avail spun out of Polygon, where Arjun had been a co-founder. In June, Avail released the second phase of its “Kate” testnet, where it went through a series of tests to encourage validator participation in the network.  Read more: Polygon Spinoff Avail Network Starts Phase 2 of Its Testnet  UPDATE (July 7, 14:06 UTC): After publication of this story, Avail clarified that the whole project, including the new data attestation bridge, is still in its testnet phase.

BRC-20 And Ordinals Boon For Miners The second quarter of 2023 has been particularly profitable for Bitcoin miners everywhere. It has brought with it a significant surge in profits, earning them a staggering total revenue of $184 million. Crypto analysts have attributed the million-dollar windfall to the popularity and rising demand for BRC-20 tokens and Ordinals. Coinmetrics pointed out that previously the fee market for Bitcoin miners used to be rather uneventful. However, the market has turned itself around and has raked in significant transaction fees for Bitcoin miners from April to June, with the latest transaction fee total being more than that of the five previous quarters combined. What Is Ordinals Protocol? The Ordinals protocol was launched in early 2023, and despite some pushback from the crypto community has enabled people to create NFT-like assets on Bitcoin by inscribing data to an individual ‘satoshi.’ (1 satoshi = 1/100,000,000 BTC; and is the smallest unit a BTC can be broken down to). Its popularity got a boost when MicroStrategy co-founder and major Bitcoin proponent pointed out the protocol’s role in raking in profits for BTC miners. Transaction Fee Surge Due To BRC-20 The BRC-20 tokens were inspired by Etheruem’s ERC-20 tokens and have blown up to reach over $240 million in market capitalization since its launch in March. To mint these tokens, users must submit a transaction accompanied by a fee. This transaction initiates the process of minting tokens on Bitcoin's network and ensures their inclusion in the subsequent block of transactions. Soon after their launch, these tokens invoked a new surge of excitement in May, as more and more people chose to pay higher fees to expedite their transactions. This pushed up BTC’s transaction fees in May, leading to speculation that the network was under attack. Nick Hansen, CEO and co-founder of Luxor Technologies, said, “BRC-20s introduced this urgency because what you needed to do was get your transactions confirmed faster than other peoples’ transactions. Then you would basically win the coins from the mint.” Miners Continue To Profit Notably, the revenue earned by Bitcoin miners from transaction fees surpassed the block subsidy for the first time since 2017, indicating the substantial impact of these fees on miners' earnings. However, the enthusiasm surrounding BRC-20 tokens has subsided, leading to a decline in payout amounts associated with transaction fees. Despite the diminished fervor, miners continue to receive substantial funds from transaction fees, especially when compared to previous years. Hansen pointed out, “We have calmed down, but we're still seeing persistent demand for Bitcoin block space. Miners are still making 10 to 15 times more from their transaction fee volume than they would have last year.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

14615303,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=541659,1688729442,Fantom (FTM) Sheds 10% Following Multichain Bridge “Withdrawals”,"Fantom (FTM) price has been experiencing a dip in the past few days. This fall appears to have worsened in the last 24 hours due to FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) spreading amongst investors. CoinGecko data shows that the FTM token has lost 10.3% of its value in the last 24 hours. This price plunge has been linked to the movement of crypto assets from Multichain’s Fantom bridge to separate wallet addresses. FTM Price Declines Amidst “Abnormal” Withdrawals From Multichain Bridge There has been some uncertainty surrounding the Fantom network lately due to the “abnormal” movement of funds from its Multichain bridge – a cross-chain bridging protocol that enables the transfer of assets between different blockchains. Related Reading: SOL Price Prediction: Solana Smashes Key Resistance, $22 Could Be Next On July 6, over $100 million worth of crypto assets were withdrawn from Multichain’s Fantom bridge. On-chain data reveals that 7,214 Wrapped Ether (WETH) tokens (worth $13.6 million), 1,024 Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) (equivalent to $31 million), and $58 million worth of US Dollar Coin (USDC) were removed from the network’s multichain bridge. Furthermore, the movement of funds from bridges of other blockchains has also been reported. Notably, Dogechain saw the withdrawal of more than $600,000 in USDC from its bridge. In addition, $4.8 million of USDC and $1 million worth of Tether (USDT) were withdrawn from Multichain’s Moonriver bridge. Although Multichain operates on other blockchains, it is understood that the Fantom blockchain is particularly reliant on the cross-chain protocol. According to trading firm Thanefield, nearly 40% of crypto assets on Fantom (excluding its native FTM tokens) made it to the blockchain through Multichain’s bridges. The price of FTM has been on a decline since these on-chain activities came under focus. As of this writing, the FTM token trades at $0.269819, losing more than 10% of its value in the past day. FTMUSD trading at $0.2692 | Source: FTMUSD chart from TradingView Fantom Spreads Calm Amidst Fears Of Exploit In the early hours of today, Multichain took to Twitter to address these “abnormal” withdrawals, imploring its users to suspend the use of its platform. The protocol claims not to know what happened but assured its users that an investigation is ongoing. The lockup assets on the Multichain MPC address have been moved to an unknown address abnormally. The team is not sure what happened and is currently investigating. It is recommended that all users suspend the use of Multichain services and revoke all contract approvals… — Multichain (Previously Anyswap) (@MultichainOrg) July 6, 2023 This announcement comes after speculations of exploitation by the general online population. Specifically, security firm PeckShield tagged the Multichain team in a tweet, asking the protocol to look at Fantom bridge transactions. Five hours after its initial tweet, the security firm then said “It seems the hack is confirmed.” It is worth noting that Multichain has been going through unspecified technical problems in the past few months. In May, the protocol’s team announced that it had lost contact with its CEO and was experiencing multiple issues due to unforeseeable circumstances. Related Reading: FUD Or Fact? Multichain Team Arrested, On-Chain Data Uncovers Fantom Exposure To Wrapped Tokens That said, Fantom has released a couple of statements on Twitter to address the issue. “We are aware of a situation unfolding on the Multichain bridge. We are actively evaluating the circumstances and will provide an update as soon as we have more to share,” the first tweet read. In another tweet, the network assured users that the FTM token was never issued or managed by Multichain. This means that WFTM (Wrapped Fantom), FTM ERC-20, and FTM on the Opera Mainnet are unaffected.

Central banks around the world bought almost 230 tons of gold in the first three months of this year, which is the most buying of gold in a single quarter that has ever been seen. Precious metals price suppression That the price of gold is still depressed perhaps bears testament to how the price of precious metals is being suppressed by the big commercial banks on the London Bullion Metals Exchange (LBMA) and the Commodities Exchange (COMEX). However, as the alleged price suppression continues, large entities are able to buy gold and silver at rock-bottom prices in preparation for a world where tangible resources are much more likely to be valued than fiat currencies printed out of thin air. The recent dumping of the gold and silver prices after huge shorting took place might be one of the western commercial banks’ last ditch attempts to keep both gold and silver from rocketing higher, which would have the potential to tear the heart out of the dollar. The BRICS nations The BRICS nations is the term for the original five countries that compose this trading block: China, Russia, India, Brazil, and South Africa. Saudi Arabia is among one of 25 other countries that are formally applying for membership of BRICS. The BRICS nations hold and produce a significant share of the world’s resources. China and Russia are the 6th and 7th biggest gold producers in the world, and Saudi Arabia and Russia are 2 of the 3 largest energy producers. With China, India, Brazil, and Russia, BRICS has 4 of the 7 largest countries in the world measured by land mass, and also 4 of the 9 largest populations. If 50% of the world’s wheat production is also put into the mix it can be seen that the BRICS nations have a massive amount of power and should they put up a rival reserve currency to the dollar they will need to be taken extremely seriously. Creation of a new bond market Some analysts and detractors might say that a BRICS reserve currency cannot really get off the ground without a deep and liquid bond market to underpin it. Be that as it may, renowned economist Jim Rickards has posited that this could be done if BRICS+ created a bond market in around 20 countries at the same time. With the massive population that the BRICS have, retail investors could be encouraged to buy the bonds, much like what happened with the Liberty Bonds, which were used in the US for the financing of the war in 1917. If all this should come to pass then the financial upheaval and turmoil in the West, where currency is based on nothing, has the potential to completely change the world order. There is not much time left for retail investors to protect themselves with gold, silver, and bitcoin. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

14613757,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=541657,1688725855,Countdown To Litecoin Halving: Is LTC Meeting Expectations?,"Litecoin (LTC) is generating significant buzz and excitement as its much-anticipated halving event approaches. With the halving just around the corner, whales—large investors—have started to make their moves, injecting a sense of urgency and driving increased interest in this crypto asset. As the countdown to the halving nears its final stages, whales have begun to enter the market, making strategic moves that have caught the attention of many. Their involvement not only reflects their confidence in Litecoin but also serves as a catalyst for renewed interest and excitement among traders and investors. Will Litecoin’s halving propel its price to new heights? Countdown To Litecoin Block Half At the time of writing, the Litecoin Block Half countdown indicated that the halving event is 26 days away. The halving, a crucial process within the Litecoin blockchain, is poised to have a significant impact on the cryptocurrency’s ecosystem. Related Reading: Recent 800 Billion Shiba Inu Dump Has Short Traders Worried – Here’s Why The concept of halving, also known as “halvening,” is an essential aspect of cryptocurrencies like Litecoin. It involves a predetermined reduction in the reward given to miners for validating transactions and securing the network. In the case of Litecoin, this reward reduction occurs approximately every four years or after the mining of 840,000 blocks. LTC market cap currently at $7.04 billion. Chart: TradingView.com By halving the block reward, Litecoin aims to maintain a controlled and limited supply of its tokens over time. This scarcity-oriented approach is based on the belief that as the supply becomes scarcer, the demand and value of Litecoin will increase. Whale Activity And Price Surge Accompany Litecoin’s Halving CoinGecko‘s latest update reveals that LTC is currently priced at $96.93, reflecting an increase of 14% in the last seven days. Source: Coingecko In addition to the price surge, there has been a notable increase in whale activity within the Litecoin ecosystem. Whales, referring to large-scale investors, have made their presence felt, indicating a growing interest in Litecoin ahead of the halving. Source: Santiment Recent data from a Litecoin price report indicates that over the past five months, an additional 32 addresses holding 10,000 or more LTC have emerged. Related Reading: Solana Shining Moment: What To Expect After SOL Crossed $20 This surge in whale activity has resulted in a significant 6% rise in the number of major LTC holders, bringing the total count of such holders to approximately 579 at the time of writing. These numbers underscore the growing confidence and participation of prominent investors in Litecoin’s future prospects, especially with the halving event on the horizon.

The exchange stated in a press release that it had received the assets in question from the United States Department of Homeland Security. Tip Of The Iceberg According to the announcement, the exchange revealed that it had managed to recover $312,219 in cash and 6.9 in Bitcoin Cash (BCH) worth around $1951 at today’s prices. The assets, stolen during the 2016 hack, were returned by the United States Department of Homeland Security. US authorities seized control of the funds in 2022 after arresting two individuals in connection with the Bitfinex hack. The exchange has been working with authorities to recover the assets stolen during the hack and return them to customers. Bitfinex stated in its blog post that the United States government was continuing to make progress in prosecuting the individuals involved with the breach. The United States Customs and Border Protection agency conducted the seizure of the recovered assets. This agency is the law enforcement agency of the US Department of Homeland Security. Paolo Ardoino, the Chief Technology Officer at Bitfinex, thanked the authorities, stating, “We are extremely pleased to be able to reach another successful milestone in the recovery of assets stolen from Bitfinex in 2016. This specific seizure demonstrates the commitment of law enforcement officials to diligently track all the proceeds of the crime committed against Bitfinex almost seven years ago. We look forward to recovering as much of the stolen bitcoin as we possibly can and redistributing that to holders of the tokens that were issued in response to the hack in 2016.” The Bitfinex Hack The Bitfinex hack was one of the biggest hacks to hit crypto at the time, with the hackers managing to steal around 119,756 Bitcoin (BTC) from the exchange thanks to a security breach. At the time, the stolen assets were worth around $71.8 million. However, at current prices, their valuation stands at a staggering $3.6 billion. On several occasions, the hackers had moved the stolen crypto around to launder the funds. However, US authorities were tracking the assets and managed to arrest the hackers in 2022. The culprits, Ilya Lichtenstein and Heather Morgan were a married couple from New York. Both were subsequently charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering. The arrest also led to the seizure of most of the stolen funds, totaling around $3.6 billion worth of Bitcoin. Deputy Attorney General Lisa O. Monaco stated at the time, “Today’s arrests, and the department’s largest financial seizure ever, show that cryptocurrency is not a safe haven for criminals. In a futile effort to maintain digital anonymity, the defendants laundered stolen funds through a labyrinth of cryptocurrency transactions; thanks to the meticulous work of law enforcement, the department once again showed how it can and will follow the money, no matter what form it takes.” Bitfinex had issued a statement as well, expressing gratitude for the recovery, adding, “We’re pleased that the DOJ has recovered a significant portion of the bitcoin stolen during the 2016 hack. We have been cooperating extensively with DOJ since its investigation of this incident began.” Redemption Of Stolen Assets Ardoino had stated that Bitfinex was looking forward to recovering as much of the stolen assets as possible and redistributing them to holders of the Recovery Right Tokens (RRt), which were issued after the hack. The tokens were intended to act as an IOU, and holders could exchange them for cash or iFinex capital stock at a later date. Currently, around 30 million RRT tokens are in circulation, which means that the amount recovered is insufficient to redeem all RRT tokens. Under Bitfinex’s contractual obligations, RRT token holders were to be redeemed at $1, after which up to 80% of any recovered assets were to be paid to SED, UNUS, and LEO token holders. According to Bitfinex, RRT token holders will have their tokens redeemed pro rata today, based on the size of their RRT holdings, on the 6th of July, 2023.

Developers said Friday that the team “is currently investigating.”  “It is recommended that all users suspend the use of Multichain services and revoke all contract approvals related to Multichain,” they said. “The Multichain service stopped currently, and all bridge transactions will be stuck on the source chains. There is no confirmed resume time.”  Multichain’s MULTI tokens have slipped 13% in the past 24 hours.  Bridges such as Multichain allow users to transfer tokens between different networks.

14612179,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=541658,1688722228,Ethereum: Is Lido (LDO) Doomed To Repeat Three Arrows Capital’s Fate?,"Market research firm Kaiko has published a study on the flagship protocol of Ethereum, Lido Finance (LDO). The study is a must-read for every ETH and LDO investor! Cautionary tales serve as a valuable reminder of the risks and pitfalls that can await even the most promising projects. Remarkably, Lido Finance has embarked on a massive growth trajectory in recent months, reminiscent of former crypto industry poster child Three Arrows Capital (3AC). Riyad Carey, analyst at Kaiko, writes: Essentially, 3AC made a bet that GBTC – a fundamentally different asset than BTC, with significant frictions in entrance and exit – would closely track BTC’s price. This saga has been front of mind as I’ve observed stETH (and other liquid staking derivatives) begin to displace ETH in DeFi protocols. Research Findings By Kaiko The in-depth research conducted by Kaiko offers critical insights into Lido’s operations and the potential risks it faces. According to Kaiko’s analysis, “Lido’s success story raises concerns about potential vulnerabilities and risks lurking beneath the surface.” By examining a wealth of data, Kaiko sheds light on liquidity challenges, leverage risks, and the potential for a large liquidation event. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Is Plunging, But It’s Too Early to Say Bulls Have Given Up Lido Finance is a platform that allows users to stake Ethereum and receive stETH tokens, which represent the value of the initial deposit and staking rewards. Kaiko’s research reveals the impressive growth of stETH tokens over the past year and a half, with the supply increasing fivefold from 1.5 million to 7.5 million, and the number of holders rising from 40,000 to nearly 220,000. The analysis conducted by Kaiko also highlights the importance of liquidity in the context of staking derivatives like stETH. One crucial aspect emphasized by the research is Lido DAO’s reliance on Curve’s stETH-ETH pool for liquidity provision. Kaiko’s data shows that since June 2023, liquidity incentives for this pool have been fading. As a result, liquidity has contracted, and a downward trend is evident. This change in incentives raises concerns about the stability of the stETH-ETH pool during periods of stress or market events, potentially triggering a liquidity crisis. Another critical aspect explored by Kaiko’s research is the increasing leverage associated with stETH usage. The analysis points out that lending and borrowing protocols have become hubs for leverage, with stETH gaining popularity as an asset for leveraging strategies. However, the research highlights the fundamental differences between stETH and ETH, coupled with deteriorating on-chain liquidity raises concerns about the risks associated with these leveraged positions. Related Reading: Ethereum Whale Transfers Over 25,000 ETH To Exchange: Massive Dip On The Horizon? Kaiko found that about one month after stETH was added to Aave V2 it became the most deposited asset, while ETH borrows skyrocketed from under $200mn to $1.6bn in just two months. The reason is alarming, according to the research firm: This is in large part due to the popularity of manually leveraging stETH: depositing stETH into Aave, borrowing ETH, swapping or staking it for stETH, and repeating as many times as one is comfortable with. This is the process that starts to sound concerningly similar to 3AC’s GBTC trade, where the founders assumed that GBTC would trade closely with BTC. Implications For The Future Of Ethereum And Lido Based on the research, the combination of deteriorating liquidity and increasing leverage presents a precarious situation where a large liquidation event becomes more likely. Kaiko states: Again, this is not a flaw in stETH but rather in how it is being used. In fact, any significant liquidation event that increases the stETH discount could present an incredible opportunity for anyone brave enough to catch the dip. The data from Kaiko’s analysis reveals the withdrawal of liquidity from the stETH-ETH pool and emphasizes the potential risks arising from insufficient on- and off-chain liquidity. This liquidity shortage could hinder the liquidation of substantial stETH positions, potentially burdening lending and borrowing protocols with significant bad debt. Kaiko’s findings underscore the importance of caution, risk management, and proactive measures to address liquidity concerns in order to safeguard Lido’s future stability. In conclusion, the company has an advice for the Lido DAO: The DAO understandably grew tired of providing such large incentives in the Curve pool, but with those incentives eliminated (for now) the DAO should seriously consider paying a market maker to provide liquidity on a variety of centralized and decentralized exchanges. At press time, the LDO price plunged by 10% in the last 24 hours, trading at $1.90. The outlook for LDO currently looks extremely bearish as long as the price continues to move in the downtrend channel established in early March.

42419939,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUGhFl,1688721920,"Bitcoin Retakes $30K, Asian Stocks Hit 5-Week Low Ahead of U.S. Jobs Report","Bitcoin (BTC) bounced and Asian stocks fell Friday as investors awaited U.S. nonfarm payrolls data after Thursday's ADP report showed better-than-expected private-sector hiring in the world's largest economy.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value rose almost 1% to touch $30,300, reversing some of Thursday's slide. The MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares, excluding Japan, extended the prior session's weakness to drop to a five-week low, while U.S. stocks registered notable losses after a blowout ADP private-sector employment report for June raised concerns of higher interest rates.  In other markets, gold rose to $1,914 per ounce and the yield on the 10-year Treasury note stood at 4.02%, down 6 basis points from Thursday's four-month high. The dollar index, which gauges the greenback's exchange rate against major fiat currencies, consolidated on overnight losses near 103.00.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics will release the nonfarm payrolls report for June at 12:30 UTC. The U.S. is thought to have added 205,000 jobs last month, FactSet's consensus estimates show, following an increase of 339,000 in May and 294,000 in April.  The unemployment rate probably dropped to 3.6% from 3.7%, while average hourly earnings are expected to have increased by 0.3%, matching May's growth rate.  What's priced in  Fed funds futures indicate traders see an 89% chance of the Federal Reserve (Fed) raising interest rates by 25 basis points to the 5.25%-5.5% range later this month. That's slightly less than the 94% seen following Thursday's ADP report and ISM services PMI data.  Traders are also pricing a 50% chance of another 25 basis point rate increase later this year.  ""If I had to estimate what the market is really trying to place as a baseline, it's a hike to 5.25-5.50% and then holding there for about ten months,"" ForexLive's currency analyst Adam Button said in a market update.  Impact on markets  With hawkish expectations already bolstered, a slight miss on the headline NFP and wage growth data could bring a positive mood back to risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.  The focus will also be on how the Treasury yield curve responds to the figure. If the curve begins to de-invert, risk assets may drop. Historically, curve de-inversions have marked arrival of economic recessions.  An inverted yield curve is the one where yields on longer duration bonds fall below yields on short duration bonds.  10:36 UTC: Adds tweet from hedge fund Telemetry's Thomas Thornton.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/07/07/bitcoin-retakes-30k-asian-stocks-hit-5-week-low-ahead-of-nonfarm-payrolls-report,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/da0d48dc3880edf3e7384ec2634892e132415f83-1716x988.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Users are now able to join the testnet as a validator or nominator and take an active role in this game-changing upgrade, while earning substantial rewards in the process. The upgrade is set to transition the world's leading Real World Asset (RWA) credit network from Proof-of-Work to Nominated-Proof-of-Stake (NPoS). The testnet phase will allow for stress-testing of the network and ironing out any potential issues before the full mainnet launch. Participants can earn their share of a reward pot that is up to 400,000 mainnet CTC and enjoy a significant head start ahead of the official release of mainnet Creditcoin 2.0+. Furthermore, there’s a bug bounty reward program of up to $1,000 for every bug identified and reported, based on severity. In the Creditcoin 2.0+ testnet, users can partake in network staking, either as Validators, running a node and validating blocks, or as Nominators, backing honest Validators. Each role comes with its own set of rewards: up to 2,000 CTC mainnet tokens for Validators and up to 100 CTC mainnet tokens for Nominators. The more you help, the more you'll be rewarded. You can get started by registering an account on the Creditcoin Community Forums and setting up a Polkadot.js wallet, the only compatible wallet for our testnet. Once you've decided on your role, familiarize yourself with the staking process through the relevant documentation for Validators and Nominators. After setting up your wallet, request Testnet tokens to participate. Validators will receive 15,000 testnet CTC tokens, and nominators will receive 1,000 testnet CTC tokens. Please note that these testnet tokens hold no value outside of participation in the testnet. Bug reports can be submitted via a form for Nominators and via Huntr.dev for Validators. Every bug reported stands a chance to earn rewards, from minor bugs fetching between $10-$99, medium bugs rewarding $100-$499, and major bugs warranting $500-$1,000. We thank our community for your ongoing support and are eager to usher in this new chapter for Creditcoin together. With your help, the transition to Creditcoin 2.0+ will be smoother, more efficient, and beneficial for all users of our network. For more details on joining the testnet and earning participation rewards, read more here.

According to the available information, over $130 million worth of crypto has been moved out from the bridge platform. Huge Outflows From Multichain The outflows first came to light on the 6th of July, when observers noticed that $102 million worth of crypto was withdrawn from the Multichain Fantom bridge on the Ethereum side. Additionally, $666,000 worth of Dogecoin and $5 million from Moonriver were also withdrawn. Additionally, 7214 Wrapped Ether (WETH) tokens worth $13.6 million, 1024 Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) worth $31 million, and $58 million worth of the USDC stablecoin were withdrawn from the Fantom bridge’s Ethereum smart contract. The total value of the cryptocurrency removed by the end of the day stood at over $100 million. Additionally, the Dogecoin bridge’s Ethereum contract saw a withdrawal of around $666,000, which accounts for over 86% of its total deposits. As a result, the bridge currently has only around $100,000 worth of assets remaining. Over $5.8 million worth of USDT and USDC were also withdrawn from the Multichain Moonriver contracts on Ethereum, with the Moonriver bridge contracts now having only around $700,000 remaining on them. Possible Exploit? Several on-chain investigators took to Twitter to warn the community that the event could be a possible exploit. Curve Finance was among the first to warn users that Multichain was, in all probability, hacked and that they should revoke all approvals. “Multichain likely hacked. Exit all multichain assets. Good idea to revoke approvals to multichain bridge if you had any.” Blockchain security firm PeckShield tagged Multichain in a Twitter post, highlighting the Phantom chain transactions and urging the team to take a closer look. Another commentator remarked that the entire fiasco looked like another massive hack, while On-chain investigator Spreek posted the Dogecoin transactions, urging the team to look at the transactions. However, Multichain did not respond to the tweets in question. Meanwhile, Fantom Foundation CEO Michael Kong stated that the Fantom team was looking into the issue. Multichain Finally Responds Multichain finally responded to users in a later tweet, stating that the movement of funds was indeed abnormal, and the team was “unsure of what was happening and is currently investigating the issue.” Multichain stated on Twitter, “The lockup assets on the Multichain MPC address have been moved to an unknown address abnormally. The team is not sure what happened and is currently investigating. It is recommended that all users suspend the use of Multichain services and revoke all contract approvals related to Multichain.” Multichain’s Growing Issues Multichain is a multi-party computation (MPC) bridging network, enabling users to bridge assets between chains. When a user wishes to bridge an asset, Multichain first confirms if the assets have been locked on the first chain. Once confirmed, the network mints the derivative assets on the second chain. When a user wishes to make a withdrawal, the process repeats itself, but in reverse. It will first confirm if the derivative assets have been destroyed on the second chain before releasing the locked assets back on the first chain. Multichain’s team claims that the cryptographic keys controlling the entire process are split into shards and then distributed throughout the network. This should, theoretically, prevent any entity from making unauthorized withdrawals. However, Multichain has been in the news for all the wrong reasons after suffering unspecified technical problems over the past few weeks. The team announced on the 31st of May that the CEO had gone missing, with the network suffering a multitude of problems due to unforeseeable circumstances, leading to significant transaction delays. Binance also announced that it was halting the withdrawal of some Multichain derivative tokens due to network issues on Multichain.

While the SEC has yet to approve such an ETF – despite receiving numerous applications – there is now more optimism the regulator will approve one because some of the previous concerns are assumed to have been addressed in recent filings, JPMorgan said.  “Spot bitcoin ETFs [have] existed for some time outside the U.S., in Canada and Europe, but have failed to attract large investor interest,” analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote.  A unit of BlackRock filed paperwork last month for the formation of a spot bitcoin ETF, prompting other asset managers such as Invesco and Wisdom Tree to apply or reapply as well.  “Bitcoin funds overall, including futures based and physically backed funds, have attracted little investor interest since Q2 2021, also failing to benefit from investor outflows from gold ETFs over the past year or so,” the report said.  Physical backed bitcoin ETFs offer some advantages over futures-based funds, but these are rather marginal, the note said. Spot ETFs offer a more direct and secure way to gain exposure to bitcoin, removing some of the complexities around direct custody and transfer of BTC and the basis risk associated with futures-based products.  “Spot ETFs are more likely than futures based ETFs to reflect real time supply and demand and their approval in the U.S. would bring more liquidity and enhance price transparency in spot bitcoin markets,” the report added.  The introduction of spot bitcoin ETFs could lead to a migration of trading activity and liquidity away from U.S. bitcoin futures markets, “to the extent spot bitcoin ETFs replace futures-based bitcoin ETFs,” the bank said.

42419932,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUGhAb,1688717487,Shiba Inu-Based Shibarium Blockchain Expected to Go Live in August,"The much-awaited layer 2 blockchain Shibarium is expected to go live after a Toronto conference in August, developer Shytoshi Kusama said in a Thursday blog.  Layer 2 refers to a set of off-chain systems (separate blockchains) built on top of layer 1 protocols that reduce bottlenecks with scaling and data. These bundle multiple off-chain transactions into a single layer 1 transaction, which helps reduce the data load and fees.  “The completed Worldpaper will be exhibited, all Shib branded projects will be published and Treat will be published in detail for the first time,” Kusama said. “In addition, it is very likely that we will also discuss and release the long-awaited L2 Shibarium.”  Developers added DoggyDAO, decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) run and governed by token holders, will be introduced at the time and used to fund projects building on Shibarium.  Shibarium’s testnet, or a testing blockchain, has seen meaningful activity in the past months with 20 million transactions from an estimated 16 million wallets as of June. Such brisk activity on the Shibarium testnet indicates demand for the network.  Developers have previously said Shibarium would have a focus on metaverse and gaming applications especially as the non-fungible token (NFT) sector is expected to heat up in the coming years.  The launch could contribute to strong fundamentals for shiba inu (SHIB), formed in the previous bull market as a Shiba Inu-themed meme coin that has since tried to position itself as a serious project with its own blockchain network and dapp ecosystem.  Meanwhile, Shiba Inu ecosystem tokens showed mixed movement in the past 24 hours.  CoinGecko data shows bone (BONE) jumped as much as 4.5%, while leash (LEASH) rose 2%.

42419948,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUGjEb,1688716344,"Bitcoin Mining Is a Game of Survival, Consolidation and Potential AI Diversification: Bernstein","Bitcoin (BTC) mining stocks listed in the U.S. have more than doubled this year after being decimated in the crypto carnage of 2022, broker Bernstein said in a research report Friday.  The resurgence has been driven by two main factors, the report said. First, strong bitcoin price action due to improving sentiment resulting from Blackrock, Fidelity and other institutional exchange-traded-fund (ETF) filings. Second, some bitcoin miners are tapping into opportunities in high-performance computing and artificial intelligence (AI) as a “revenue diversification strategy,” the note said.  “This is a unique game of survival where the best-in-class miners with low costs and conservative debt profiles can survive, consolidate capacity and market share, to earn hyper-normal profits when bitcoin prices exceed the cost of production,” analysts led by Gautam Chhugani wrote.  Bernstein notes that weaker miners with high debt are not able to survive and “capitulate during crypto winters,” citing the recent bankruptcy of Core Scientific (CORZQ).  The broker says the first round of consolidation has already played out and surviving miners are now adding capacity in anticipation of bitcoin halving, when mining rewards are cut by 50%, an event that typically drives the BTC price higher. The next bitcoin halving is likely to occur around April 2024.  Wall Street giant JPMorgan also recently said in a report that over time the bitcoin mining industry will consolidate and become more competitive because only miners with lower production costs will be able to survive.

14607020,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=541650,1688710422,Solana Shining Moment: What To Expect After SOL Crossed $20,"Solana (SOL) recently experienced a significant milestone by crossing the $20 price mark. This achievement has sparked considerable enthusiasm among investors and crypto enthusiasts alike, as Solana’s bullish momentum continues to gain traction. With its growing popularity and impressive performance, what can investors expect from Solana after this milestone? Let’s delve into the factors behind Solana’s recent success, explore its potential for further growth, and assess the risks and opportunities that lie ahead for this emerging cryptocurrency. Solana: Remarkable Surge And Bullish Sentiment Solana (SOL) has experienced an impressive ascent to new heights, as its price broke through the $20 threshold, reaching $20.27, according to the latest data from CoinGecko. This notable surge indicates a 3.9% rally within the past 24 hours, accompanied by a substantial overall increase of 11.7% over the course of the past seven days. Source: Coingecko Analyzing SOL’s Open Interest (OI) chart provides further evidence of the prevailing bullish sentiment in recent weeks. A SOL price report reveals a consistent upward trajectory of the OI, closely following the surge in prices since June 20. These findings indicate that speculators hold strong bullish convictions regarding SOL’s future prospects. Source: Coinglass Related Reading: Recent 800 Billion Shiba Inu Dump Has Short Traders Worried – Here’s Why Although there was a slight setback on July 3, which led to a pullback from $19.8 to $18.5, the price action and OI chart continue to signal an enduring bullish sentiment over the past two weeks. While the buying pressure may not be as robust, the upward trajectory of SOL’s performance could persist if Bitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency, were to experience further upward momentum. Bitcoin’s Role in Solana’s Momentum Bitcoin has an indirect influence on the overall cryptocurrency market, and Solana is no exception. As the Bitcoin price has safely maintained its position around the $30,000 level, it provides stability to the broader market and allows altcoins like Solana to flourish. Bitcoin’s stability helps maintain investor confidence and encourages risk-taking in other cryptocurrencies, including SOL. As a result, Solana has been able to experience its remarkable surge and sustain its bullish momentum. SOL market cap currently at $8 billion. Chart: TradingView.com While SOL’s surge is driven primarily by its own merits and growing popularity as a blockchain platform, the overall market conditions shaped by Bitcoin’s stability have certainly played a part in facilitating Solana’s ascent. As investors seek alternative opportunities and diversification beyond Bitcoin, Solana’s impressive performance and potential for further growth have garnered significant attention and contributed to its recent surge.

What’s the point if games are no fun?”  The Japanese firm had previously announced that it would withhold some of its best-known games and IP from blockchain. However, it still intends to allow third-party developers to produce blockchain games. Last year it announced that it had signed a deal with a development house called Double Jump Tokyo to develop blockchain games based on its lesser-known IP.  The company had always been cautious about the allure of blockchain gaming. When it first announced that it was entering the field, it prefaced its entry by saying it would withdraw if “it is perceived as simple money-making.”  Sega is an investor in Asia-based crypto fund IVC, which is an active investor in GameFi projects.

They sent bitcoin tumbling below $30,000 for the first time in almost two weeks. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization had recently surged back to $30,100, down 1.3% over the past 24 hours. The decline followed just hours after bitcoin hit a new three-month high above $31,500, a continuation of investor bullishness stemming from multiple spot bitcoin ETF filings last month.  Markets have become increasingly hopeful that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), will reverse its pattern of rejecting the applications by some of the world's most prominent financial services firms. But on Thursday, concerns about economic growth, a precursor to inflation, trumped any euphoria.  Ether followed a similar downtrodden path, sinking quickly from a high above $1,950 after the ADP report, which showed the private sector adding 497,000 jobs, more than double forecasts. The ISM Services Index rose to 53.9 in June, higher than the 51.2 consensus estimate and May's 50.3 reading. The reports fresh fuel for the U.S. central bank to justify additional rate cuts in its quest to tame inflation. Such hawkishness has often weighed heavily on crypto and other asset markets, fretful that the Federal Reserve will throw the economy into a steep recession.  Investors were less impressed by May's Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) report, which showed job vacancies sinking to 9.82 million, down from an upwardly revised 10.3 million in April.  ETH, the second largest crypto in market value, was recently changing hands at $1,853, a 3.1% drop from Wednesday, same time. Most other major cryptos plunged deeply into the red before regaining some ground. Litecoin and popular memecoin SHIB were still off more than 6% and 3%, respectively. SOL, the token of the Solana blockchain soared over 11% at one point and was still up more than 4%. The CoinDesk Market Index, a measure of crypto markets overall performance, was recently down 1.7%.  Asia equity markets were down in early trading, with the Hang Seng and Nikkei off about 1% and 0.5%, respectively. They followed declines in U.S. indexes with the tech-focused Nasdaq and S&P 500 both sinking 0.8%. Meanwhile, yields on 2- and 10-year U.S. Treasurys both rose, and safe haven gold edged up.  In an email to CoinDesk early Thursday, Richard Mico, U.S. CEO of Banxa, a crypto payment and compliance infrastructure provider, noted bitcoin's support at $30,000 amid the spot BTC applications and a range of positive signals, technical and otherwise.  ""We could still have a rate hike or two ahead of us, but the Federal Reserve certainly appears to be closing in on peak rates if not already reached,"" Mico wrote. ""We’ll likely have to wait until next year’s Bitcoin halving to experience full-on bull mode, but we’re getting closer by the day and many are keen to front-run what they expect will be a continued uptrend.""  He added: ""The market is reflecting an increasingly optimistic sentiment and the next 18 months are going to be very exciting.”  Biggest Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Solana SOL +4.2% Smart Contract Platform Polygon MATIC +0.3% Smart Contract Platform  Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Shiba Inu SHIB −3.1% Currency Ethereum ETH −3.0% Smart Contract Platform Stellar XLM −2.5% Smart Contract Platform  Insights  Whale Activity a Bullish Signal?  Despite a recent increase in bitcoin whales, large BTC holders remain reluctant to move assets on to centralized exchanges, Glassnode data shows.  Bitcoin whales, and whales moving assets on to exchanges have taken separate paths, as large investors seem wary of moving their assets out of cold storage.  Bitcoin investors are likely cautious about exchange risk, regulatory hurdles, or a combination of the two.  The combination of large entities holding increasing bitcoin supplies and a decreasing supply to exchanges indicates bullishness among investors.

14598870,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=541632,1688691622,"Ripple vs SEC: No Money For Years, XRP Holders Lose If SEC Wins, Says John Deaton","John Deaton, a pro-XRP lawyer, recently made some statements regarding the ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Deaton believes that if Ripple loses to the SEC, no money may be collected for years, and only if Ripple loses on appeal. However, he also believes that if the Supreme Court takes on the appeal, which he thinks they will if Congress hasn’t acted by then, Ripple will win hands down. Ripple Legal Troubles Could Linger For Years Deaton’s view is that if the SEC wins, Ripple will appeal, and the current status quo will continue for the next 2-5 years. Deaton emphasized: Assuming the SEC wins and the civil case lawyers get a win because the judge in California follows Judge Torres’ ruling, Ripple will appeal that case as well, and there will be no money for years, if ever. In such a scenario, if Ripple loses all the appeals, the SEC would collect the money, not the civil plaintiffs. The SEC would then offer a payback fund for XRP holders to sell their XRP, as in Veritaseum. The Veritaseum and the ongoing Ripple cases are similar in that they both involve allegations of unregistered securities offerings in the cryptocurrency industry. Related Reading: Glassnode Co-Founder Predicts Bull Run For Bitcoin Amidst Sideways Trading In the Veritaseum case, the SEC alleged that Veritaseum and its founder, Reginald Middleton, conducted an unregistered initial coin offering (ICO) that raised approximately $14.8 million. Similarly, in the Ripple case, the SEC alleged that Ripple conducted an unregistered securities offering by selling XRP to investors. After the Veritaseum case was concluded, the SEC set up a Fair Fund to distribute the funds collected from the defendants to investors harmed by the unregistered securities offering. The Fair Fund enabled investors who participated in the Veritaseum ICO to apply for a refund of their investment. This development could serve as a precedent for how the SEC may proceed with the Ripple case if it successfully proves that XRP constitutes a security. In such a scenario, the SEC may similarly establish a Fair Fund to compensate investors who purchased XRP during the unregistered securities offering. XRP Holders Can Continue To Believe Their Assets Are Not Securities Furthermore, Deaton argued that being on the “75K list”- a list of over 75,000 XRP holders named as potential “intervenors” – is a good thing because a massive putative class of XRP holders is easily identifiable. By joining the class list he put out, no one waived anything whatsoever, and if there were ever any money for XRP holders from the civil case or the SEC case, he would likely be contacted because he has the list of the “75K.” The list’s purpose is to allow these XRP holders to potentially seek reimbursement or other relief if the SEC’s case against Ripple results in a judgment or settlement that impacts the value of XRP. By joining the list, these individuals are indicating that they believe XRP is not a security and that they should be allowed to participate in any proceedings related to the case. Additionally, Deaton advises ignoring the people who claim that joining the 75K list and arguing XRP isn’t a security is a bad thing if there is one day a monetary recovery for XRP holders. Related Reading: Ethereum Whale Transfers Over 25,000 ETH To Exchange: Massive Dip On The Horizon? Overall, Deaton believes that the civil case may not lead to anything. If the SEC wins, it would collect the most money and offer the best option, “ironically.” Also, if Ripple loses and Congress fixes this regulatory mess during the 5 years of appeals, it all “goes away anyway”, according to the pro-XRP Lawyer.

The criminal probe is looking into Verge Center for the Arts' allegations that Powell hindered its computer accounts, obstructing access to emails and other messages, The Times reported, citing three unnamed sources.  The paper reported that agents had searched Powell's Brentwood home in Los Angeles' Westside, seizing electronic devices and said that law enforcement from the FBI and the U.S. attorney’s office for the Northern District of California have been investigating Powell since at least the fall.  Powell has not been charged with any crimes. Brandon Fox, a lawyer with Jenner & Block, said in a statement shared with CoinDesk that Verge ""provided a one-sided account that did not provide the government with the full picture, showing that Powell ""did nothing wrong."" Fox added that the matter is unrelated to ""Mr. Powell’s employment or his conduct in the cryptocurrency arena.""  Last month, Powell sued Verge in California Superior Court, claiming that has ""owns and has rightful access"" to the email accounts and that he remains a Verge board member, Fox said. A lawyer for Verge said the Powell's claims were unfounded, The Times reported. At the time of publication, Verge had not responded to a CoinDesk request for comment.  Powell co-founded the Sacramento-based Verge in 2007, but the organization removed him from its board in 2022, saying that he had violated Verge's ""guiding principles,"" The Times reported.  In a statement shared with CoinDesk, a Kraken spokesperson said the exchange was aware of the civil dispute, investigation and search warrants.

Crypto assets that can be used as instruments of payment have proliferated into more than 10,000 variants since the 2009 debut of Bitcoin, the first and still the largest. The bewildering speed with which they have developed and the pseudonymity they can provide have left tax systems playing catch up. By Katherine Baer, Chief of Revenue Administration Division II, IMF’s Fiscal Affairs Department; Ruud de Mooij, Deputy Director, IMF’s Fiscal Affairs Department; Shafik Hebous, Deputy Division Chief, IMF’s Fiscal Affairs Department; and Michael Keen, Deputy Director, IMF’s Fiscal Affairs Department Tax systems need updating to cope with crypto assets, whose anonymity and decentralized nature poses challenges - not least for the value-added tax. Crypto assets that can be used as instruments of payment have proliferated into more than 10,000 variants since the 2009 debut of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), the first and still the largest. The bewildering speed with which they have developed and the pseudonymity they can provide have left tax systems playing catch up. In a new paper , we discuss how governments can address the emerging challenges of taxing these crypto assets while its use is still limited so that they prevent a leakage in tax revenue and protect the integrity of the tax system. Classifying crypto Views of crypto assets are diverse and held with passion. The prospect of liberating financial transactions from oversight by governments and the involvement of financial institutions is a libertarian dream for some. El Salvador and the Central African Republic have gone so far as to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender. Critics, however, see crypto assets as not merely inherently worthless but a front for crime, scams, and gambling. They also point to their dizzying volatility. Bitcoin, for instance, soared from $200 a decade ago to nearly $70,000 in 2021 before plunging to around $29,000 today. The collapse of FTX last year and recent US Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuits against Binance ( BNB-USD ) and Coinbase ( COIN ) have fed anxiety among users while the appeal to criminal activities has been reflected in high-profile seizures of billions of dollars. These developments have triggered increasing scrutiny from policymakers and widespread calls for regulation. But whether crypto assets ultimately boom or bust, a coherent way to tax them is needed. A key issue is how to classify crypto assets - should they be regarded as property or currency? When crypto is sold for profit, capital gains should be taxed as they would be on other assets. And purchases made with crypto should be subject to the same sales or value-added taxes, or VAT, that would be applied for cash transactions. So, one important task is to ensure application of these principles, which requires clarity on how to characterize crypto for tax purposes: in essence, as currencies for VAT and sales taxes and as assets for income tax purposes. While this is not easy due to the evolving nature of crypto asset transactions, it is perfectly possible. The deepest challenges are then in enforcement. Revenue considerations Crude estimates suggest that a 20 percent tax on capital gains from crypto would have raised about $100 billion worldwide amid soaring prices in 2021. That is about 4 percent of global corporate income tax revenues, or 0.4 percent of total tax collection. But with total crypto market capitalization down 63 percent from the late-2021 peak, tax revenues would then have shriveled. If these losses were fully offset against other taxes, there would be a corresponding reduction in revenue. In more normal times and with the current market size, global crypto tax revenues would probably average less than $25 billion a year. That, in the broader scheme of things, is not a huge amount. There are also important fairness issues at stake. Though their pseudonymity makes it hard to be sure exactly who holds crypto, there are signs that ownership is heavily concentrated among the relatively wealthy - even though holding of crypto is strikingly common across people with low incomes too. Available surveys indicate that about 10,000 people hold one quarter of all Bitcoin. There is also VAT. Crypto transactions have similarities to those in cash in their potential for being hidden from tax administrations. Today, the share of purchases made with crypto is still small. But widespread use, if tax systems were not prepared, could someday mean widespread evasion of VAT and sales taxes, leading to materially lower government revenues. This may be the biggest threat from crypto. Addressing implementation The most fundamental difficulty in taxing crypto assets is that they are “pseudonymous.” That is, transactions use public addresses that are extremely difficult to link with individuals or firms. This can make tax evasion easier. Implementation is thus at the heart of the matter for tax authorities. The problem is surmountable when people transact through centralized exchanges, since these can be made subject to standard “know your customer” tracking rules, and possibly withholding taxes. Many countries are putting such rules in place with the expectation that tax compliance will improve. However, reporting obligations could induce people to keep tax authorities ignorant by instead using centralized exchanges abroad. To address that concern, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has developed a framework for crypto-related exchange of information between countries. Implementation, however, is some way off. A more troubling possibility is that reporting rules (and the failures of some crypto intermediaries) could induce people to transact increasingly through decentralized exchanges or directly through peer-to-peer trades where no central governing body oversees these transactions. Those are still extremely difficult for tax administrators to penetrate. Given the complexity of the fundamental challenges posed by pseudonymity, the rapidity of innovation, the vast information gaps, and the uncertainties ahead, the tide has not yet turned in the battle to incorporate crypto properly into the wider tax system. Some of the elements needed for doing so - such as clarity in their classification for tax purposes - are clear. But the challenges are fundamental, and the risks, particularly to the VAT and sales taxes, may be greater than people recognize. As many (though far from all) governments are beginning to realize, policymakers need to develop clear, coherent, and effective frameworks for taxing crypto.
