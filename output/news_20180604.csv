42401596,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd0CHM,1528153257,"Days After Launch, the EOS Blockchain Still Isn't Live","Days after first initiating its launch in an unorthodox, distributed process, the EOS blockchain isn't yet live, but so far, the software appears to be progressing toward that goal without major issues.  As profiled by CoinDesk, after raising a reported $4 billion over the last year to create the software necessary to launch the blockchain, the company that created it is leaving it to its community to actually get it off the ground. That doesn't mean there haven't been material updates, however, or that Block.one, the company in question, hasn't been involved in the initial booting effort.  Rather, the company released version 1.0.0 of the EOS software on Saturday and already it's published one update to the code, version 1.0.1, a release that Block.one CTO Daniel Larimer described as preventing a ""potential crash"" in the update notes, along with other minor issues.  This means that, as of now, participants in the EOS initial coin offering (ICO), which ended on Friday, have purchased all the initial ethereum tokens that will ever be used to bootstrap the project. The plan was always for these tokens to be frozen at the end of the ICO, in preparation for a formal blockchain launch, meaning those coins won't be tradeable again until EOS is live. (It's unclear at this time how exchanges are managing their book-keeping while trading continues.)  The last big event took place June 2 at 10:59 UTC, when the tokens froze on ethereum and so-called ""snapshots"" were taken in order to preserve a record that can later be used to allocate tokens issued on the EOS blockchain to their owners. By all accounts, this occurred on time and without any issues (here's one description).  ""Things are going about as we expected. A few road bumps, no show-stopping problems. I'm expecting the [blockchain] to be live in the next couple of days,"" Kyle Samani of Multicoin Capital, one of EOS's most prominent endorsers, told CoinDesk.  Still, it has been remarkable how unified block producers, or the entities jockeying to process transactions on the new blockchain (and thus receive its rewards), have appeared outwardly given the global scale of the launch.  ""I've been part of calls of 60 to 90 people every day,"" Marc-Antoine Ross, the CEO of EOS Canada, told CoinDesk, adding:  ""What I think is important is we all published agreement to launch one chain.""  Bumps and bruises  But this outward coordination has not been without a lot of behind-the-scenes effort.  Indeed, a controversy broke out in the EOS launch community last week when a group calling itself ""Ghostbusters"" published a critique of the launch approach led by EOS Canada, another group vying to become a block producer.  EOS Canada had published a piece of open-source software called ""EOS BIOS"" on April 9, a suite of code that aimed to coordinate the launch of the EOS software. Its had dozens of subsequent releases since then, with version 1.0.0 coming out on Saturday. ""A lot of block producer candidates validated this solution to launch the network,"" Ross said.  That said, the critique was seconded by other block producer candidates.  The May 28 blog post argued:  ""Using the EOS BIOS process will create unnecessary risks for the EOS blockchain launch and ultimately all EOS token holders. Also, any negative press on insecurities in EOS blockchain launch or failed attempt to launch the blockchain will have a negative impact on EOS price and reputation.""  It argued that the channels between the various nodes needed to be more secure, using layers that obscure IP addresses and encrypt data as it passes between block producers.  EOS Canada promptly responded with a call for ""increased collaboration"" arguing that some of the vulnerabilities identified were settings needed for efficient testing, not a production launch.  In a subsequent post, Ghostbusters described theirs as the ""security first"" approach.  Unity prevails  But while it looked like there could be a split in the larger EOS community, one that could result in two competing blockchain launches, the greater value in consensus, it seems, has prevailed.  On Saturday, participants in a livestream supporting the launch announced that the two sides had resolved their differences (which Ross confirmed), affirming that everyone has agreed to coordinate with EOS BIOS and it should have no problem integrating with Ghostbusters preferred security measures, according to Ross.  ""We've opened our hand to the Ghostbusters,"" Ross told CoinDesk, ""to make sure we have one strong network.""  Members of the Ghostbusters coalition have not responded to request for comment from CoinDesk.  As such, there haven't been the forks or competing blockchains that many people feared. One group has launched EOS Classic, which basically recreates the existing token balances on ethereum, where people are used to trading them. The creators use something of a complicated process for users to claim their tokens, but MyCrypto CEO Taylor Monahan asked her team to look at it, and they don't see anything dangerous about an EOS holder claiming EOS Classic tokens.  ""It looks like it is in the current snapshot in time, it has no way to steal private keys from what I can see,"" Monahan wrote, though she warned that sometimes scams can come in phases, so that could come next.  Just as Block.one reserved 10 percent of EOS tokens for the company, the EOS Classic reserves the same for itself, in what could be just another simple play for easy crypto money.  Casting ballots  Other fears relating to the launch have been assuaged so far, including those relating to the selection of block producers via voting, a necessary action needed to help EOS determine just who would be in charge of maintaining its blockchain.  As this vote was to be carried out by those who own EOS, a range of possible complications were theorized. These included that potential voting tokens could end up idle or lost forever because token holders never registered an EOS address (a necessary step to migrate their coins from ethereum).  This process has been going for a year now, and the designers of the process expected token buyers on ethereum to remember that at the end of the process they would need to take action in order to hold onto their tokens and create an EOS address and associate it with their ethereum address. It's not surprising that this message didn't get through to everyone who had ever bought any EOS.  So, in order to prevent the exclusion of crypto users who weren't following the EOS blog, the EOS community coded up a workaround so that users wouldn't lose their tokens. Basically, for all the laggards, they generated an EOS version of of their ethereum public key. That way, once the user created an EOS version of their private key (offline, preferably), they could claim their tokens.  ""Think of it this way, your ethereum public key is just the wrapper around a longer array of numbers which are compressed into a 64 character string that you call your public key,"" EOS New York, another potential block producer, explained in a post on Steemit.  But there may never have been much reason to worry about the likelihood of enough votes coming together to launch the chain. It turns out that there are some very big whales out there, people who have a powerful vested interest in making sure that the system launches.  Redditor @Lannisan crunched the numbers from the snapshot balances and found that (if Block.one is excluded — and it should be because it has committed to sitting out the block producer vote) the 10 biggest wallets hold 39 percent of all tokens. In other words, those 10 could decide almost anything they wanted if they coordinated. The top 100 wallets control 65 percent of the tokens.  These numbers are again somewhat skewed by the fact that some of these ""whales"" must be exchanges, and some of the biggest exchanges have committed to not voting their users' tokens. Still, there are probably a few large holders out there who plan to vote once they feel comfortable with a mainnet release, so that it goes live. With so many large holders out there, it doesn't sound like hitting 15 percent of the tokens voting will be difficult, even if not that many actual people vote.  Ross would not commit to any kind of timeline for EOS to go live.  The block producers are running a variety of testnets now, any one of which might meet all the checks for the chain, the software and the security that they are looking to validate. When they all agree they have a configuration that works, a group announcement will go out calling for holders to prepare to vote for the first slate of block producers.  When it goes live, that's when we'll really start to understand Dan Larimer's latest technology.  As Siddharth Kalla, co-founder of the Turing Advisory Group, told CoinDesk:  ""The real test of whether one should be alarmed or not would come once the network is live and running. The human side of security, voting, economic incentives, etc, are much harder to test than bugs in the code during the testing phase.""

42401598,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd0CIL,1528149645,Former SEC Chair to Represent Ripple in XRP Lawsuit,"Court records show that distributed ledger startup Ripple is being represented by two former Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) officials – including its onetime chairwoman, Mary Jo White – in an ongoing civil matter.  Twin filings reveal that White, along with Andrew Ceresney, are representing Ripple in a lawsuit first filed in May by investor Ryan Coffey. Both are currently employed at Debevoise & Plimpton, where White serves as senior chair.  Ceresney served as the SEC's director of enforcement between April 2013 and December 2016, with White serving as SEC chair between that period up until the end of the Obama administration in January of last year. Their representation of Ripple was first reported by Law.com on Monday.  Records also indicate that the case itself has moved from the San Francisco County Superior Court to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.  As previously reported, the proposed class-action lawsuit alleges that Ripple violated state and federal securities laws. It centers around the question of whether XRP is a security, given its relationship with Ripple (which asserts that the digital asset is wholly distinct from the private company).  The lawsuit names XRP II, Ripple's registered and licensed MSB, and CEO Brad Garlinghouse among the defendants.  Back in May, the company disputed the basis of the lawsuit and reiterated that it doesn't believe XRP is a security.  ""Like any civil proceeding, we'll assess the merit or lack of merit to the allegations at the appropriate time. Whether or not XRP is a security is for the SEC to decide. We continue to believe XRP should not be classified as a security,"" Tom Channick, Ripple's head of corporate communications, told CoinDesk at the time.  In a statement sent to CoinDesk following the publication of this article, Ripple said:  ""We're ready to fight this opportunistic suit in the appropriate federal court. We feel confident that the claims regarding XRP are completely unfounded both in law and fact.""  Image via Sen.

42401593,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd0CDQ,1528138202,Crypto Startup Coinbase Names CEO for Japanese Subsidiary,"Cryptocurrency startup Coinbase is officially headed to Japan.  The company announced Monday that Nao Kitazawa would serve as chief executive of Coinbase Japan as part of its expansion roll-out to that market in a blog post. Coinbase first announced in 2016 that it would open services in Japan, following an investment of $10.5 million from a group that included Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ and Mitsubishi UFJ Capital.  ""As in other markets, we plan to take a deliberate approach to our rollout in Japan, which means working hand-in-hand with the Japanese FSA to ensure compliance with local laws at every stage,"" the startup said, referring to Japan's chief financial regulator.  According to Crunchbase, Kitazawa previously served as COO of Money Design, an automated investment manager and advisor. He also worked in an investment banking role for Morgan Stanley Japan.  That Coinbase would move to open an office in Japan is perhaps unsurprising, given the growing exchange ecosystem there that has taken shape after the country's government began formally regulating cryptocurrencies as a kind of payment method.  In its blog post, Coinbase suggested that more information is forthcoming about its services in Japan, though it remained mum on what those announcements might be.

42401602,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd0CLI,1528117224,"Crypto and Twitter: A Toxic Combination, A Troubling Future","Michael J. Casey is chairman of CoinDesk's advisory board and a senior advisor of blockchain research at MIT's Digital Currency Initiative.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.  OK, Ardor fans. You have your wish. Your favorite token is getting a mention on CoinDesk.  Not, perhaps, for the reasons you want. But they do say all publicity is good publicity. So, there you have it. The response to my column last week on layer-two solutions was mostly positive with the usual dose of critics, but it was the Ardor tribe who caught my attention when one reader's tweet, complaining that I hadn't mentioned the blockchain platform, prompted others to pile on with accusations of my bias and ignorance.  It got me thinking about how financial self-interest, which has always skewed people's perceptions of the media they consume, is being taken to a new level when crypto tokens are involved.  I do believe blockchain technology and related ideas around prediction markets and reputation will one day help us sort through the free-for-all of competing truths that the social media age has produced. For now, though, I worry that all we're doing is creating a global brawl of angry people, all believing that they and only they own the truth.  This is really not about Ardor. (From what I can tell, Ardor's framework for enabling ""child chains"" makes an interesting contribution to the evolution of crypto technology.)  What this is about is how people invested in the multiple tokens attached to competing projects that similarly claim to be making some quantum leap in blockchain capability come to passionately believe that theirs is superior to everyone else's and deserves more prominence than it's getting.  In Ardor's case, it's the holders of the main platform's ARDR token as well as those invested in the child chain Ignis token. But I could just as well be talking about holders of ETH, XRP, IOTA, BCH and yes, BTC.  Fanatical, blinkered investors are nothing new, of course. It once was the case with GE's shareholders – definitely, not any more. It's always been so for investors in Warren Buffet's holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, and in this past decade we've seen it with Tesla. But there are two factors that make the phenomenon more extreme in the age of cryptocurrency.  The first is the sheer volume of coins and the large retail investor base they attract.  The second is that social media is now the primary means by which market-relevant information is distributed. And social media, for better or worse, is essentially anarchy.  Combine these two and you end up with something worse than the troll armies that already cause such public angst around social media. You get monetized trolls.  The scammiest way this plays out is with bots. Bailey Reutzel's great little survey of some classic spam bot moments in ""Crypto Twitter"" shows how distorting the combination of crypto and social media can be.  But there's also lots of human-led ugliness: anonymous trolls disrupting healthy dialogues with ad hominem attacks and coin-pumping tweets filling our news feeds.  Now I believe that, eventually, anarchic social media might evolve to point where it's far superior to the traditional media model that preceded it. And, as I mentioned, blockchain-based ""proofs"" and skin-in-the-game staking systems might one day help us sort through this mess.  Under the old, centrally-managed system, where news organizations filtered the important public information before it reached its intended audience, there was an inherent constraint on the amount of information available. And there was an access problem.  So, just as ICOs have shown how access to capital might be democratized, one could argue that social media has also created a potentially more democratized model of access to publishing systems. (I say ""potentially"" because in many respects what has happened is we've shifted power from the old news establishment to a new form of media behemoth: the follower-rich celebrity – think Donald Trump, or Justin Bieber.)  However, with no viable, decentralized mechanism as yet for rewarding honesty and good behavior, or for processing information so that some kind of consensus can be formed around it, we're left with noise. Worse, there's a broken feedback loop in which metrics such as the market cap of a token or the followership of a social media account reinforce and confirm people's biases.  We saw it with the XRP mob that jumped on the New York Times' Nathaniel Popper after he cited bankers saying they weren't using the token associated with Ripple. The mob was unleashed, ironically, by a former co-editor of TechCrunch and now vocal investor – Michael Arrington – who vehemently claimed that Popper must have made up his quotes.  The swarm of XRP fanboys was unmoved by the logic that for a reporter at the Times to do such a thing would be professional suicide – read about Jayson Blair for background on this.  Or there's the IOTA gang that collectively pumped out an alternative narrative that my colleagues at the MIT Digital Currency Initiative who'd discovered flaws in IOTA's hashing algorithm were conflicted by business interests. Or the gang of ethereum supporters who took as gospel truth Vitalik Buterin's claim that CoinDesk is complicit in enabling crypto scams.  Attacks on the press have happened for as long as it has existed. That's not a bad thing per se. Any functioning society maintains a vigorous critique of media organizations. Some form of bias is unavoidable in media coverage. It deserves to be questioned.  But news organizations are no longer the all-important filters they once were. They represent one, increasingly small sector of a vast array of sources claiming to offer relevant information.  And unlike those other individual and corporate sources, news organizations – the good ones at least, those that can get beyond their owners' and their advertisers' interests and practice sound journalism – shouldn't be captured by the same heavily financial biases.  So it's disturbing that we've gone from discovering Facebook's #fakenews problem to the appropriation of that term by those who peddle the view that mainstream media is the main source of disinformation, to the even more extreme scenario in which a market for information is composed of participants with tokens whose value they want to protect.  If we're going to tokenize everything, which may or may not be a good idea, this cacophony of competing truths peddled by different self-interested mobs will likely get even worse. What happens when celebrities and companies and dictators have their own coins, with armies of rabid supporters doing their bidding in this battle for truth? Decentralized solutions to this are still a long way off.  I'm not totally sure how we stop this train for now, except to make a plea formed by my own, unavoidable pro-journalism bias. I humbly ask that people in the crypto community have a little more respect for journalists who, while far from perfect, are at least trying to produce news and content that's not skewed by their or anyone else's investments.

The amount makes the investment one of the largest traditional funding rounds in the blockchain space to date, though, according to CoinDesk's Venture Capital Tracker, Robinhood's $363 million round announced last month is still way out in front.  As explained in an announcement from Qulian on Sunday, the news comes just a week after the deal's lead investor Xinhu Zhongbao, a Shanghai-listed real estate and finance firm, first disclosed its plan to invest in the project in a filing with the Shanghai Stock Exchange on May 27.  The document indicated that Xinhu Zhongbao intended to invest 1.23 billion CNY ($192 million) in Qulian through a combination of a $17 million capital contribution transfer and a $175 million new equity issuance. The deal resulted in the investor holding 49 percent of Qulian's shares.  Founded in 2016, Qulian sets out to develop enterprise-grade solutions based on its hyperchain blockchain platform. Based on Xinhu Zhongbao's disclosure, the firm recorded revenue of $281,000 and a net loss of $2.34 million in 2017, while the firm was valued at $234 million.  This is the second time that Xinhu Zhongbao has shown its support for Qulian, having already purchased a small amount of the firm's shares in April 2018, at which point the investor valued Qulian at $78 million.  The three-fold increase in valuation over two months has predictably drawn scrutiny from financial regulators in China. In a letter of inquiry published on May 27, the Shanghai Stock Exchange required the lead investor to justify the rapid change in Qulian's valuation.  Zhongbao Xinhu replied to the regulator:  This is a business judgement made by the company and other co-investors based on a comprehensive evaluation of Qulian. There is a risk of a mismatch in (Qulian's) income and valuation.  At press time, Qulian could not be reached by CoinDesk for comment.

According to an Investor China report on Monday, the company involved – called Zhaoyun Group and apparently based in Hangzhou – focuses on the healthcare and scientific research industry. While the company's official website does not include any information about an ICO, posts on social networkshttps://www.jianshu.com/p/a26f7751de52 and forums indicate that the company launched a token sale on April 8.  According to the posts, Zhaoyun Group targeted the issuance of 170 million of its own ERC-20-based (an ethereum standard) tokens, dubbed Trillion Cloud Gold (TGCG), 10 percent of which were sold through a public offering.  Data  from etherscan.io, the website that tracks transactions on the ethereum blockchain, shows that all the tokens were created in mid-March 2018, but that no transactions were made thereafter.  Through conversations with promotors in the token sale's WeChat groups, the report indicated that the public offering raised the $18 million through a tiered distribution system wherein members receive a return on their investment by attracting additional investors to purchase the token.  The report went on to call the firm's conduct ""questionable,"" given that it could have violated China's notable ban on ICOs, while the firm's business model appears to ""very similar"" those seen in pyramid and Ponzi schemes.  The reported ICO comes at a time when Chinese authorities have stepped up its efforts in cracking down on crypto-related fundraising activities, as well as on those that use the concept to fleece investors through pyramid schemes, as previously reported by CoinDesk.

42401601,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd0CMH,1528106418,Bitcoin's Low Volume Breakout Could Be a Bull Trap,"Bitcoin looks primed for a move to $8,000, but low trading volumes point to the risk of a bull trap.  The cryptocurrency broke through a key descending trendline (drawn through the May 6 high to the May 21 high) on Sunday, adding credence to last Tuesday's bullish outside-day candle and signaling a short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change.  However, at the same time, daily trading volume fell 1.77 percent to $4.85 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. Further, rolling 24-hour trading volume currently stands at $4.95 billion – down 22.5 percent from the current quarterly average of $6.38 billion.  Low volume is a cause for concern for the bulls, as it is widely considered a sign that the market is approaching a peak; that is, the rally will be short-lived.  Hence, a slight pullback seen today does not come as a surprise. At time of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading at $7,591 on Bitfinex – down 2 percent from the previous day's (UTC) close of $7,718.  Daily chart  The bullish outside-day candle followed by a bullish crossover between the 5-day and 10-day moving averages (MAs), and an upside break of the falling trendline, indicate scope for a rally to $8,000.  However, the decline in trading volume over the last seven days puts a question market on the sustainability of the corrective rally from $7,040 (May 29 low) to $7,779 (Sunday's high).  4-hour chart  On the 4-hour chart, trading volume has picked up as prices fell back to $7,549 from the high of $7,764.  The anemic trading volume during the price rally and the later increase in trading volume during negative price action indicates a high probability of a downside break of the rising wedge pattern. In such a case, bitcoin risks falling back to last week's low of $7,040.  View  The upside break of the falling trendline has opened the doors for a rise to $8,000. However, low volumes may indicate a false breakout.  A downside break of the rising wedge seen in the 4-hour chart would allow a drop to $7,040.  Only a high-volume break above $7,700 could yield a sustainable rally to $8,000.

42401590,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd0CAT,1528099205,Meet the Dapp Market: A Twist On Open Source Is Winning Developers,"""[For the] entirety of the history of technology, open-source software developers have had to live like paupers.""  While this is a bit of an exaggeration, Kevin Owocki has a point: making a living can be rough for developers of open-source software, that is, software for which the code is made freely available to use, modify and redistribute under licenses that mostly preclude hallmarks of ownership such as patent rights.  As the founder of Gitcoin, a decentralized bug bounty marketplace, Owocki is trying to fix that.  And this push comes at a time when many open-source developers are lamenting the struggles of their passion, as a Medium article called ""A Bitter Guide To Open Source"" makes its rounds.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Owocki described the categories open-source maintainers and developers fall into: either they work on their pet projects for free outside regular work hours (which can be draining); they solicit donations from the users of their software (which generally doesn't garner much pay); or they work under the auspices of a corporate sponsor (which turns off some developers that appreciate their autonomy).  None of these are perfect options, so Gitcoin, launched in September 2017, aims to create a marketplace whereby open-source developers – particularly those that focus on ethereum and the decentralized applications or ""dapps"" that run on top of it – can get compensated for whatever work they want to do.  ""Open source produces billions of dollars a year in economic output, but the expected value is free,"" Owocki told CoinDesk in interview, adding:  ""Somewhere between those two numbers is what a rational market would actually pay for open-source software.""  Gitcoin, a closely allied platform to Bounties Network, and others aim to build that ""rational market"" by establishing marketplaces where developers get paid in crypto. And already, Gitcoin and Bounties Network are attracting active users – though, admittedly, still small ones.  Still, since these marketplaces are also dapps in their own right, they're challenging the narrative that many that have raised money don't have solid use cases or good intentions. Looking ahead, Gitcoin and other dapp developer marketplaces could change that discussion even further by giving developers some incentive for improving today's dapps or building new ones that users want.  How it works  Both Gitcoin and Bounties Network are two-way marketplaces, in which projects post ""bounties"" – discrete chunks of work such as fixing a bug in some software – and developers complete them as their skills and schedules allow.  The bounties are hooked up to GitHub, a popular repository for open-source code, and the transactions – priced in ether or any other ERC-20 token – are mediated by ethereum-based smart contracts.  The two projects function in more or less the same way, since Gitcoin adopted Bounties Network's protocol for ethereum smart contracts and IPFS data storage in November. That was around the time that Gitcoin joined Bounties Network under the umbrella of ConsenSys, an ethereum startup and incubator.  Both projects have now begun to build user bases.  Owocki told CoinDesk that Gitcoin has 220 daily active users. In all, developers total have completed 350 bounties on the platform, worth close to $47,000. Bounties Network, meanwhile, has seen 263 users complete bounties worth $97,000, the project's founder Mark Beylin told CoinDesk.  To date, Owocki said six people have been hired full-time after doing work on Gitcoin, describing the process as ""try-before-you-buy hiring."" Rather than ""working with a recruiter who doesn't really understand the position that they're hiring for, or who charges 20 percent of an engineer's first-year salary, you can … buy and build a relationship before you decide to get hitched.""  And while the marketplaces function relatively similarly and are interoperable due to their shared smart contract protocol, they each have slightly different focuses.  Gitcoin, for the time being, is concentrating on open-source software (""depth""), whereas Bounties Network – while most of its bounties are still for code fixes – also aims to attract work such as website design and translation (""breadth"").  According to Bounties Network's head of community Simona Pop:  ""Our goal is to make this available to a whole range of audiences that aren't necessarily proficient in code or extremely tech-savvy, because the wider population actually isn't.""  Supply and demand  One of the reasons for these new decentralized marketplaces' success is the disadvantages of today's alternatives.  Christopher Allen, co-founder of the GitHub Blockchain Guild, which provides financial support to open-source developers, described traditional bug bounty programs as siloed. They ""are often written in forms that benefit a single company, rather than an ecosystem,"" he said.  And the traditional platforms that do offer marketplaces of work from different institutions and projects, like Bountysource and Upwork, are generally filled with ""noise,"" Market Protocol CTO Phil Elsasser, who posts bounties to Gitcoin, told CoinDesk.  ""We had tried things like Upwork early on, but it was very hard to find solid developers and also to screen through the massive amount of noise on the platform,"" he said, noting that developers on Gitcoin are easy to come by and tend to be of a higher caliber.  Still, Elsasser's comment hints at one of the hurdles faced by developers on decentralized marketplaces today – that these sites continue to be heavy on developers but light on teams posting bounties.  Owocki, though, put a positive spin on the mismatch, saying that he's proud to be offering an application developers are interested in using.  Still, there are other hurdles.  For instance, because the system runs on ethereum, users must pay ""gas"" (the unit used to price fees on the network) to commit changes to the blockchain, such as posting a new bounty or sending a payment for work done. If more developers and businesses start using these decentralized marketplace dapps, they could push up against ethereum's scaling limits, a la CryptoKitties, leading to high fees and transactions backlogs for participants.  Plus, connecting ""web 3"" applications like Gitcoin to ""web 2"" browsers like Google Chrome requires installing and running Metamask, a browser app designed specifically for interacting with ethereum, which could be a roadblock for some users.  But initial reports indicate that participants on both sides of the marketplace like the service. The organizations that have sourced the most development work from Gitcoin include notable decentralized apps and platforms: Augur, ethereum, MetaMask and uPort.  And Kenneth Ashley, a web developer who's completed several bounties on Gitcoin, told CoinDesk:  ""It's really straightforward. You claim a bounty, you do the work, you get paid. There have been times where all this happens within an hour.""  Owe it to ICOs  Putting these challenges aside, though, Gitcoin and Bounties Network have accomplished something few dapps have.  They've turned the typical dapp lifecycle on its head, launching live platforms and attracting users without having sold tokens or even published white papers (Gitcoin has a page where you can sign up to receive the white paper ""if/when"" it becomes available and mentions elsewhere that it might consider a token distribution at some point in the future).  Ironically, though, Gitcoin and Bounties Network owe much of their success to ""the whole ICO hype pump-and-dump scene,"" as Owocki describes it.  ""There's actually funding for open-source software right now,"" he told CoinDesk. ""Now, because we have open-source money, there's open-source jobs that are being built on top of that open-source money. As those open-source monetary foundations are looking to deploy their capital, they're going to deploy it in a place that leverages their technology.""  As for the possible stumbling blocks, Owocki waves away ""short-term concerns.""  When it comes to scalability, he trusts the ethereum developers to solve the issue; as for user experience, he suggests that can be tweaked until it's no longer a problem.  Twenty years down the line, he argues, we're likely to see the results of a virtuous cycle, whereby Gitcoin and other decentralized marketplaces lead the dapp space out of the white paper and ICO fundraising stage – not just by example, but by actively contributing to its development.  Using blockchain developer slang for ""building,"" Owocki said:  ""The more we focus on BUIDLing, the more dapps launch, the more users they get, the more devs can continue entering the space.""

In a segment named ""Dialogue,"" aired Sunday night through the station's Finance Channel, CCTV host Chen Weihong featured an hour-long discussion that was for the first time dedicated to educating its wide audience-base on the concept, potential and risks of blockchain technology.  The conversation also featured prominent figures from the blockchain industry in both private and public sectors including Don Tapscott, the well-known author of ""Blockchain Revolution.""  Other speakers included Chen Lei, CEO of cloud network giant Xunlei, and Zhang Shoucheng, a physics professor at Stanford University and founder of Danhua Capital, a venture capital firm that invests in blockchain technology.  Most notably, after Tapscott and Chen kicked off the discussion by explaining the basic concept of blockchain and distributed ledger technology, the host continued by suggesting blockchain is the second phase of the internet and has a value 10 times greater than its predecessor.  On that theme, Zhang commented:  ""While the real value of the internet is aggregating individual pieces of information into one place, which is exactly what Google and Facebook does, we are now entering an era where information is being decentralized so that individuals can own their individual data. And that's the real value of blockchain that makes it exciting.""  That said, the program was in parts critical of the nascent technology and the topic of initial coin offerings (ICOs) did not escape the conversation.  By summarizing some of the usual marketing slogans used by potentially fraudulent ICOs and having each speaker to explain them to the station's wide audience base, the program again signaled the station's ongoing efforts to scrutinize cryptocurrency projects in China.

42401600,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd0CJK,1528084803,Public or Private? Blockchain Distinctions Are Falling Out of Fashion,"""Convergence"" may mean different things to different people in blockchain, but it's a word that's appearing more and more in public rhetoric of late.  For some, it simply means that innovations developed on a public blockchain powered by a cryptocurrency can be leveraged on a private blockchain used by enterprises, and vice versa. But to others, the rise of the term shows that the lines between these categories, once starkly drawn, are starting to fade.  As companies start to recognize the merits of public chains; as new technology enables different types of ledgers to communicate with each other; and as central banks consider issuing digital versions of their fiat currencies that could be used to settle trades in blockchain assets; nomenclature is evolving to fit the times.  ""I would like to see in a year from now for most people to think it's absurd to say 'private networks' or 'public networks,'"" John Wolpert, the former blockchain lead at IBM, said at Consensus 2018.  Back in 2015, the industry needed to diverge into public and private spheres, Wolpert said. But to him, it's becoming clear that the industry is now heading the other way.  His own CV supports this idea, as he left IBM last fall to take up the new position of ""seeker of awesomeness"" at ethereum design studio ConsenSys. Indeed, seeing big names from world of enterprise blockchains jump over to join startups focused on the public domain is a telling sign.  In another example, former JP Morgan blockchain lead Amber Baldet's new project, Clovyr, is all about building the middleware developer tooling and connectivity services to make convergence a reality.  There are plenty of rational reasons for people to use private networks, Baldet told CoinDesk, whether it's for added privacy, control over corporate governance, or ""a computationally expensive game to get performance and cost benefits.""  ""As public networks gain value – it becomes where their customers are – connectivity will be an obvious evolution,"" she said, adding:  ""Pressuring businesses to move core operations to public chains is unnecessary; soon enough the lines between public and private will blur into a pragmatic and functional internet of value.""  Internet/intranet analogy  So, what does this mean in practice? Even in the highly regulated, cryptocurrency-averse world of banking, some seasoned technologists see a potential osmosis between public, open-access blockchains and private member-access networks somewhere on the horizon.  John Whelan, director of Banco Santander's Blockchain Lab, drew on the internet-intranet analogy, often used by cryptocurrency proponents to argue private blockchains will one day dissolve to insignificance.  ""I think we may see – although not guaranteed – some kind of convergence between private permissioned ledger networks,"" said Whelan. ""For private and permissioned [version], I would use the intranet analogy, and the public networks I would use as the internet analogy, with suitable bridging protocols, which are in development.""  However, Whelan said the important first part of the convergence story must take place within the banks themselves: a massive reduction in the number of ledgers, duplicated technology and reconciliation.  ""The financial industry is moving from an architecture of many ledgers, to one of fewer ledgers. It's that simple,"" he said.  Others are more skeptical about the notion of public-private convergence at the network level, but still see the two spheres influencing each other.  ""On the product level, I think we can expect to see continued cross-pollination of ideas and technologies between public and private blockchains, since there is a great deal of technical overlap between these two types of system,"" said Gideon Greenspan, CEO of MultiChain, a startup that helps organizations build and deploy blockchains.  But the scalability, confidentiality and governance requirements are completely different for public and private chains, he added.  ""I rarely, if ever, hear of a use case that could be sensibly implemented on either,"" said Greenspan. ""The closest I've seen is using a public chain to notarize a hash representing the state of a private chain, and this can make sense for extra security, but I don't really think you can call it 'convergence.'""  Feedback loop  Of course, such views aren't stopping progress in the form of collaboration. The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA), formed in 2017 to develop standards for private forks of ethereum, has become one of the more visible convergence-seekers backed by major banks and businesses.  The group recently released a long-awaited spec, plus details of how its architecture stack dovetails with the work of the Ethereum Foundation, the nonprofit that promotes the development of the public ethereum cryptocurrency. All this has occurred under the guidance of new EEA chief Ron Resnick.  The EEA sees a positive feedback loop between features developed for enterprises and the ethereum improvement proposals (EIPs) that are floated by developers for the public network.  ""As more standards are established by the EEA, I'm sure more opportunities to base standards on EIPs and vice versa will start to emerge,"" said Conor Svensson, founder of blk.io and chair of the Quorum and core standards working groups at the EEA. ""I am optimistic we will see this starting to happen in 2018.""  Perhaps the most prominent example of this so far has been work that Amis Technologies did with its implementation of Istanbul Byzantine Fault Tolerance for the ethereum client Go Ethereum (Geth).  This ethereum improvement proposal (EIP-650) added a new consensus algorithm to Geth, one better suited to financial enterprises than existing proof-of-work or proof of authority. And it was then added to Quorum, the private blockchain platform developed by JP Morgan.  Svensson also pointed to identity as another area where public and private chain boundaries could theoretically be crossed, since identity on a blockchain is always protected by a private key.  ""As long as the private key remains secure, you have a notion of identity that can potentially be used on multiple chains (provided they use the same underlying cryptographic algorithms),"" he said.  However, ""whether you should use one identity across multiple chains is another question entirely,"" he said.  Cash on ledger  Still, a prerequisite for full-fledged convergence of public and private chains would be the development of fiat cash on distributed ledgers, or so many seem to agree.  This would allow all sorts of digital assets and blockchain-based financial instruments to flow through the systems more easily since users would trust a government-backed currency more than a volatile cryptocurrency.  ""Cash on the ledger is an essential if not the essential building block for commerce on ledger platforms,"" said Clark Thompson, global solutions architecture lead at ConsenSys.  The ethereum-based app builder has a dedicated team of experts looking at all varieties of fiat cash on distributed ledgers, and it's working with UnionBank of the Philippines to create a low-cost tokenized fiat solution for rural banking. In time, this could be extended to cover a larger network of banks and perhaps even the central bank, ConsenSys says.  Indeed, while fiat currency held in a traditional bank account can be represented as a token on a distributed ledger, this setup creates redemption risk, which might put off some investors. The ultimate digital cash, from enterprises' point of view, would be a central bank-issued digital currency (CBDC).  ""Central bank policy changes are necessary to permit central bank-issued tokenized fiat, which has the advantage that (like cash) it carries no counterparty risk,"" said Thomson.  It's anybody's guess how long such a change would take, though, as central banks themselves are still tentatively exploring the concept.  But Whelan at Santander (a member of the Utility Settlement Coin consortium, which is attempting to make central bank money on distributed ledgers a reality) said he believes there could be a CBDC on a distributed ledger ""within a few years.""  What remains to be seen is whether it is deployed directly by central banks, or uses a kind of two-step process where commercial banks essentially lend money into the system.  Whelan concluded:  ""This is really a policy question for the central banks to examine. That's not a technology question.""

42401586,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd0C5Y,1528082504,SBI Launches Japan's First Bank-Backed Crypto Exchange,"Japanese financial giant SBI Holdings announced on Monday that its in-house cryptocurrency exchange is now live, after a months-long delay due to security concerns.  Called VCTRADE, the service is currently only open for users who have pre-registered with the platform in October 2017, the company said in the announcement and expects it to be available for a wider public in July of this year.  In addition, SBI said as a first step, VCTRADE will focus on the trading of XRP, the native token derived from the Ripple protocol, after which the exchange will sequentially add supports for bitcoin and bitcoin cash, though an initial timeline for that remains unclear at this stage.  The decision is perhaps not entirely surprising given SBI Holdings' existing works in piloting the remittance technology provided by the San Francisco-based Ripple that uses a distributed ledger to make cross-border transactions.  SBI Holdings first established its wholly-owned subsidiary - SBI Virtual Currencies - in October 2016 in a bid to launch the country's first crypto exchange that is fully backed by a major financial institution.  The platform later completed business registration with Japan's Financial Services Agency (FSA) in September 2017 but announced in February of this year that the opening would be delayed due to security concerns amid the Coincheck hack.  The new service also comes after SBI Virtual Currencies has canceled a partnership in March with crypto exchange Huobi that would use the latter's financial and technological resources to launch VCTRADE.
