42377415,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70a0T,1403218816,Russia to Clarify Bitcoin Policy in Forthcoming Task Force Report,"Russian financial authorities appear to be close to clarifying their stance on bitcoin with the announcement of a forthcoming paper to by published by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an intergovernmental body set up to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.  Rossiyskaya Gazeta, a Russian-language news source, is reporting that the paper will mark the conclusion of research conducted by anti-money laundering (AML) and terrorist financing officials at the FATF and other agencies within Russia and around the world, including the US and UK.  The FATF paper is being spearheaded by the International Training and Methodology Center of Financial Monitoring, a division within Russian financial regulatory body, the Federal Financial Monitoring Service of the Russian Federation (Rosfinmonitoring).  The media outlet said that project manager Eugene Volovik spoke about the initiative during a meeting of the Eurasian Group on Combating Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism (EAG) in Moscow. There, he explained the current climate and the need for tighter controls within Russia on what he called unchecked digital currency movement.  Volovik also acknowledged the transformative role that digital currencies may very well play long term, saying:  ""Just as e-mail today has replaced the usual post offices and telegraph came to replace SMS and popular services such as Skype or Whyber [...] radical changes [could] begin with virtual currency.”  Paper to focus on money laundering  Volovik stated that the paper will outline the challenges digital currencies pose to domestic AML and terrorist financing personnel, and he added that such an effort is important for the potential of digital currencies to be fully employed.  By targeting the illicit uses of bitcoin technology, government regulators can support the development of a more mature digital currency ecosystem.  However, Volovik reiterated that despite these promises, Russian regulators remain committed to preventing digital currencies from being used to support criminal acts, which he said remains an outsized problem.  Russia undecided on bitcoin  Bitcoin has had a thus-far complicated history in Russia, owing to rumors that national financial authorities had initially banned the digital currency.  However, a later release from the Bank of Russia suggested that the bank was more focused on keeping bitcoin technology from supporting terrorist and criminal financing rather than simply outlawing it entirely.  According to Volovik, Russia belongs to a large group of countries that remain divided on bitcoin. Still, he added that an outright ban has not technically been put in place, as discussions are still ongoing about the future of digital currencies in Russia.  Notably, Rossiyskaya Gazeta followed up with an official from Rosfinmonitoring, who said that according to the country’s constitution, bitcoin is not a legal form of money.  Edit (20th June, 10am): This article previously stated that FATF was a Russian organisation, in fact it is international. This has now been corrected.

42377422,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70a81,1403215238,"Pantera, Binary and SecondMarket Emerge as Silk Road Bitcoin Bidders","The US Marshals Service (USMS), the federal agency charged with carrying out the auction of 30,000 BTC seized by the FBI in the shutdown of online black marketplace Silk Road, inadvertently gave bitcoin industry observers a first look at some potential bidders for the bounty yesterday in a move that has since been widely lampooned by the media.  This unintentional error occurred when the agency accidentally revealed a lengthy list of names of those who had expressed interest in the auction process during an attempt to provide an informational update to these parties.  Though that list contained some prospective bidders, heavyweights in bitcoin's burgeoning investment sector are now stepping forth as confirmed bidders that may prove more influential to the ultimate outcome of the auction.  Barry Silbert's alternative investment marketplace SecondMarket and private investment vehicle Bitcoin Investment Trust, investment management firm and BitFury investor Binary Financial and bitcoin investment fund operator Pantera Capital have all indicated to CoinDesk that they will be participating in the upcoming auction, to be held on 27th June from 06:00 to 18:00 (EDT).  Speaking to CoinDesk, Binary Financial managing partner Harry Yeh explained the importance of his firm's participation in the event, noting how it will provide what may be the first big stage on which the bitcoin investment community can showcase its purchasing power.  Yeh said:  ""It's just one of those big plays that you have to be involved with if you're a big player. [...] It's very rare that you have the opportunity to source such a large block of coins.""  The highly publicized auction is also generating increased interest from first-time investors, the firms say.  Yeh noted that bitcoins that passed through the US government could prove advantageous to own in the event of an audit, and that they may end up selling for 10%-20% below market value under certain conditions.  SecondMarket builds auction syndicate  SecondMarket and the Bitcoin Investment Trust, the investment initiatives led by CEO Barry Silbert, are among the firms that have been more vocal about their participation in the upcoming auction, publishing a call for interested investors to join their bidding process.    Register here to receive info about how to participate in our bidding syndicate for US Marshals bitcoin auction: http://t.co/CexnsYrt7c      — Barry Silbert (@barrysilbert) June 17, 2014    Silbert indicated that their strategy for the auction will be to open up the participant pool to those who may have been dissuaded or barred by requirements set for by the USMS.  He stated:  ""Our syndicate will open up bidding to a much larger field of smaller purchasers, foreign buyers and bidders who don’t want their identity revealed to the US government.""  For example, Silbert noted that to participate, bidders need a US bank account account, which bars foreign investors. Further, bidders will need to make their identity known to the US government, though his comments suggest that members of SecondMarket's syndicate will not need to abide by such restrictions.  Silbert also suggested uncertainty regarding the government's auction process could also provide powerful leverage for investors to join the syndicate.  He added that it is not yet known what the government may ultimately release regarding the auction results, meaning the names of the coins' owners could be publicized or otherwise disseminated.  Binary casts all-in bid  Though it has operated mostly out of the spotlight since its inception, Binary Financial is organized as a private, multi-strategy hedge fund that invests in industrial mining, trades bitcoins and provides arbitrage services.  Yeh told CoinDesk that Binary intends to bid on all nine of the Silk Road auction blocks, and that the majority of its capital sourcing for the auction is nearly complete.  Aside from prestige that could come from participating in the event, he said that buying bitcoins directly from the US government has a number of practical advantages over obtaining the assets on the open market. He went on to discuss how buyers using an exchange to buy 3,000 BTC would pay a premium for the coins, as the act of buying the coins would force the price to rise as the order is being filled.  Still, he cautioned that average investors could feel the movements of the auction, and that they, too, should be prepared accordingly, saying:  ""We expect on the day for there to be increase volume of trading and heavy selling pressure.""  Pantera's stealth bid  The participation of Pantera Capital is also notable given that the investment fund was created by influential backers Fortress Investment Group, Benchmark Capital and Ribbit Capital, and was at one time suggested to have had $147m in assets.  Dan Morehead  , founder and CEO of Pantera Capital, did not provide many details about Pantera's bidding strategy, citing the need to protect its competitive interests. However, he did confirm that Pantera has seen an uptick in interest from investors due to the upcoming Silk Road auction.  Morehead said:  ""We've seen a lot of new investors come to us to talk about the auction, so I think it's good for the community.""  Morehead also stated that Pantera is seeking to invest its own proprietary capital, along with funds from its investors, as part of the upcoming auction.  Fierce competition  Of course, the firms will likely face fierce competition from each other and other as-yet unknown bidders given the auction process designed by the USMS. The 29,657 BTC, now located in this wallet, are to be divided up into ten blocks, including nine blocks of 3,000 BTC and one block of 2,656.51306529 BTC.  Though this process could theoretically create multiple winners, this may be unlikely given the terms of how bids on multiple blocks will be governed.  For example, the USMS has stated that those who bid on multiple blocks could be awarded any number of blocks up to the maximum number. This means should a buyer move to purchase all of the coins, it could be awarded multiple blocks up to the overall total.

42377413,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70Zxx,1403209517,How Unsuspecting Homeowners Helped Hackers Mine 500 Million Dogecoins,"New details have emerged regarding the illicit mining of roughly half a billion dogecoins in the winter and early spring of 2014, which mainly targeted unsuspecting homeowners and may have affected thousands of customers of Taiwan-based manufacturer Synology.  Earlier this week it came to light that an as-yet unidentified hacker or hackers gained administrator access to network attached storage (NAS) servers sold by Synology. This resulted in the creation of roughly 500 million dogecoins over a several month-long period, with activity peaking in February.  The malware attempt first came to the company’s attention in September, prompting a quick response and the development of a software fix within four days of initial discovery. A follow-up fix was announced in February. However, some customers failed to update their NAS servers. As a result, those involved with the hack were able to exploit security vulnerabilities and create a botnet that mined bitcoin and dogecoin.  Many of the customers involved were homeowners who largely remained unaware of the problem until it had already been addressed by Synology. Thadd Weil, public relations specialist for Synology America Corp., told CoinDesk that the event was the first time that a digital currency-focused cyber attack successfully impacted their customers.  However, he said that attempts to do so have happened before and are likely to take place again, stating:  “We’ve become a target, because we’re one of the names in network attached storage. As such, nefarious people have been aiming their guns at us since the end of last year, most particularly. We’ve been releasing operating system updates frequently [as a result].”  Initial response led to quick bug fix  Weil explained that in mid-September, the company’s security response teams were alerted to fraudulent activity taking place. He added that the discovery was part of Synology’s routine scanning activities. Within four days of discovering the malicious files embedded in the NAS servers – contained in folders entitled “PWNED” – Synology was able to generate a patch that nullified the effects of the software.  The company later released another update, announced in a February press statement, that outlined the problems and identified the malicious data involved. This response was published after some users took to social media platforms to alert Synology about sluggish performance of their NAS boxes and unusually high CPU usage.  Update protocol flaws  However, the vulnerability remained unaddressed for most users because the fix was not announced on a broad enough scale. Weil acknowledged that the company could have done a better job communicating with customers who may have been at risk, explaining:  “We didn’t do a good enough job letting [our customers] know why they needed to update their operating system.”  Weil continued by saying that prior to the incident, Synology did not directly upgrade the NAS server software. As a result, some customers never addressed the security flaw, which enabled those behind the hack to repurpose the NAS servers for bitcoin and dogecoin mining.  Synology now issues automatic upgrades to its customers as a result of the patch protocol flaw.  Weil added that Synology has been keeping track of the issue since mining activity on its hardware spiked, with the most recent update coming out this week.  Unsuspecting targets  Another part of the problem was that the most common targets in this case were homeowners who don’t nearly use the bandwidth capacities of their NAS servers. Because of this, many customers weren’t even aware of the problem unless they were using significant processing power.  The choice of targeting Synology’s products mirrors attacks on mobile devices and with the intention of creating a botnet. By pooling the resources of many small devices, a hacker or hackers can generate enough hashing power to successfully mine digital currency, whether its bitcoin or dogecoin.  As in those cases, the NAS servers don’t generate much computing power – “it’s kind of like assigning a calculator to do 3D rendering,” as Weil explained – but, on a broad scale, are capable of significant hashing power when used for mining.  Weil was unable to provide a specific number on the amount of customers that were affected, but he speculated that it must have been “in the thousands”.",NEGATIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | DOGE | MINING,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/06/19/how-unsuspecting-homeowners-helped-hackers-mine-500-million-dogecoins,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/30a1db13500f174c01bd4f2e93724dfcf305a346-1027x724.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377408,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70Zsv,1403206211,Bolivia's Central Bank Bans Bitcoin,"El Banco Central de Bolivia, the central bank of the South American nation, has officially banned any currency or coins not issued or regulated by the government, including bitcoin and a list of other cryptocurrencies including namecoin, peercoin, Quark, primecoin and feathercoin.  The official policy, launched on 6th May, has recently surfaced to garner coverage from Spanish-language news source PanAm Post, and is the first announcement by the country's central bank on the subject of digital currency according to research from the US Law Library of Congress.  A translation of the central bank statement reads:  ""It is illegal to use any kind of currency that is not issued and controlled by a government or an authorized entity.""  The bank went on to say that citizens are prohibited from denominating prices in any currency that is not previously approved by its national institutions.    Such a ban, the document states, is necessary to protect the boliviano, the country's national currency, and to safeguard users from the kind of uncontrolled currencies that can lead to the users losing their money.      The decision to fully ban bitcoin puts Bolivia in unique standing in the international community, as other nations previously believed to be embracing restrictive policies – including China, Thailand and Russia – have since backed away from implementing similar measures.    Bolivia stands alone  Bolivia's announcement is also unique within the context of decisions made by its South American neighbors. For example, earlier this March, a report suggested that The Superintendencia Financiera de Colombia (SFC), Colombia's central bank, may have been seeking to implement a bitcoin ban.  However, despite worries from the local community, such fears did not come to pass. Colombia stopped short of the expected announcement, choosing instead to bar banks from working with digital currency companies.  Elsewhere in South America, central banks in Argentina and Brazil are permissive to digital currencies, according to analysis from BitLegal.  South America reacts  Notable members of South America's bitcoin community had varying reactions to the news.  Christian Nubis, chief product officer at recently launched Latin American exchange Bitex.la, suggested that the move would not have a substantial impact, as ""Bolivia is not a leader in the region on matters of public policy"".  However, others such as Sebastian Serrano, CEO of Argentina bitcoin merchant processor BitPagos, lamented the fact that such an announcement will do little to encourage the local startup community and prohibit bitcoin from helping those in the country who could benefit from economic freedom.  Serrano said:  ""The news from Bolivia is very sad, especially considering it is one of the poorest countries in Latin America.""  He added: ""Hopefully, Bolivia will revert its decision in the future as bitcoin continues to prosper in the rest of the world.""  Translations provided by Randy Brito.

42377404,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70ZqP,1403203516,Cai-Capital Opens Up UK Property to Foreign Cryptocurrency Investors,"Since the bitcoin price rose sharply last year, the sale of properties for the digital currency has become, if not commonplace, definitely a growing trend – albeit for more luxury properties.  Now, a new company is entering the cryptocurrency housing sector.  Offering international investors the chance to buy UK properties with an extensive range of digital currencies, including bitcoin, Cai-Capital claims to be the first UK firm providing this facility.  Targeting markets such as China, Russia and the Middle East, the Cheltenham-based company, which works in partnership with estate agent Hill-Mathieson & Partners, hopes that cryptocurrency payments will draw in new customers for the company's sales, letting and property management services.  Cai-Capital has been actively following the development of digital currency, so director Keith Stukins says the move is a natural progression for the company. He explained:  ""The list of companies accepting digital currency transactions continues to grow daily and is increasingly becoming a more popular way of conducting business. In this arena, Cai-Capital leads the way in the UK Property sector.""  Going digital  By introducing digital currency payments, clients will have opportunities to purchase property without the uncertainty of swings within the exchange rates found in normal money markets, the company director said.  Furthermore, this method enables greater flexibility than typical banking exchanges and transfers, although any prospective clients will still need to be wary of local laws and compliance issues.  Unusually for a mainstream business, Cai-Capital is accepting most major digital currencies, with more being added on a weekly basis.  At present, said Stukins, the company can facilitate the exchange of bitcoin, litecoin, ripple, maxcoin and quark, among others. The exception, he said, is currencies that are new to the market and have little or no market volume.  Security procedures  Taking on board security concerns clients may have regarding trading in digital currency, especially following the media fanfare of Mt. Gox's downfall, Cai-Capital applies a ""risk-adverse process"" to ensure funds remain safe once they arrive with the company.  On receipt of a transfer, Stukins indicated, Cai-Capital moves the funds into private paper wallets that are stored securely. Then, to ensure exposure of loss is kept to a minimum, transfer amounts are agreed with the client as the funds are moved between the private paper wallets and Cai-Capital's cryptocurrency broker partner Acquire CC.  All paper wallets adhere to a proprietary multi-signature process to reinforce security and the client's money is deposited directly into his or her lawyer's account prior to the exchange of contracts or purchase completion.  The funds remain within the clients lawyer account until disbursements are required. The process is similar to any other property purchase if not simpler, Stukins said.  China targeted  One further advantage – for the cryptocurrency community this time – is that, as property deals often involve large amounts of funds, using a partner such as Acquire CC helps execute such deals without triggering a market price movement.  This is achieved by spreading the transactions in multiple instances across various markets simultaneously, Stukins explained.  When asked how much business has so far been conducted in digital currency, he said, ""interest continues to grow, which has resulted in a bitcoin transaction in the region of £1m being completed with a further transaction being in the latter stages of the process"".  Furthermore, the company's recent business trip to Hong Kong received significant interest and media attention, said Stukins:  ""We envisage a high level of enquiries to be forthcoming, particularly from mainland China.""  Bitcoin in the property market  While Cai-Capital may be the first firm offering cryptocurrency-financed property sales and rentals in the UK, other companies have already started offering similar services worldwide.  In January, Manhattan-based real estate brokerage firm Bond New York announced it would be accepting bitcoin as payment for property transactions. In the same month, Canada-based Quantum Properties began accepting bitcoin deposits for properties it sells locally.  Rental services are also catered for, in the US at least. Startup Rentalutions, an online platform that helps landlords manage leased properties, started accepting bitcoin for rent last August.  Furthermore, a number of individual owners have made their properties available for bitcoin.  In December, former casino owner Jack Sommer offered his luxurious Las Vegas mansion for $7.85m or the equivalent in bitcoin, and in March a $500,000 Bali villa sold in what may have been the biggest bitcoin purchase on record.  On a similar note, Canadian Kevin Kelly is holding a 'competition' called CryptoCondo, in which he is selling tickets for bitcoin with the random winner to take over ownership of his luxury apartment in Toronto.  Homeless outreach Sean's Outpost is helping adjudicate the draw, which is effectively a kind of crowdsale, and will take 5% or more of the final winnings, which are hoped to be in excess of $520,000.

42377402,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70VgV,1403196576,British MP: Bitcoin May Be the ZX Spectrum of Digital Currencies,"Private currencies sponsored by corporations will replace state-backed money and even distributed cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, said UK politician Douglas Carswell at a talk hosted by prominent think-tank the Institute of Economic Affairs yesterday.  Carswell, who is Member of Parliament for the seaside resort town of Clacton in the east of England, compared bitcoin to the ZX Spectrum – a personal computer released in 1982 that was among the first machines to be adopted by mainstream users.  Despite its early introduction to the marketplace, the Spectrum was eventually eclipsed by other personal computers over the years.  Carswell said:  ""Bitcoin might be to currency what the ZX Spectrum was to computing. You knew it was something exciting when you saw it, but it took 20-30 years before [widespread adoption].""  Company credit  It will be corporations or other providers of utility who are most likely to introduce a currency that would be used by the vast majority of people, he indicated. This would be driven in part by digital currencies like bitcoin, but also because of high inflation rates and a ""doomed"" post-Bretton Woods system.  ""The intriguing question that will determine the shape of the world is ensuring that every country has access to a multiplicity of reserves [...] whether it's bitcoin, O2 credit, Tesco credit. I suspect [the dominant currency of the future] will be backed by a large company that provides something of utility. A mobile phone company, or a supermarket chain,"" he said.  Carswell, a member of the Conservative party, is a noted for his outspoken commentary in the UK press, through a column in The Telegraph and appearances in national broadcast media.  He previously advocated for bitcoin last July in an blog post, espousing similar views to those expressed at the IEA talk.  About the meeting  The talk at the institute also featured a number of prominent academics, including Dr Forrest Capie, Professor Emeritus of Economic History at Cass Business School, City University, London; Kevin Dowd, Professor of Finance and Economics at Durham University Business School, who recently published an IEA paper on bitcoin; and Timothy Evans, a Senior Fellow at the Cobden Centre, also in London.  Also speaking were Akin Fernandez, founder of London's first bitcoin voucher store Azteco, and Dominic Frisby, a comedian who has worked on an acclaimed documentary about the global financial crisis.  The BBC's technology correspondent, Rory Cellan-Jones, moderated.  Several panellists expressed optimism that non-state currencies would be the way of the future, although there was a divergence in views on whether bitcoin would be a dominant currency and whether it could be considered a form of money.  As Capie noted:  ""Bitcoin might be a good investment [due to its limited supply] but it's not money. If demand grows, which seems likely, and the supply is constrained [then the price will rise].""  The IEA event was oversubscribed, with more than 60 people attending, the institute said. The think-tank organised the event in conjunction with the publication of Dowd's paper on bitcoin.  The IEA is known for being a prominent supporter of free markets and is closely associated with the work of economist Friedrich Hayek. Over the years, 12 winners of the Nobel Prize for economics have authored research work published by the organisation.

Different variants of existing symbols were also proposed, alongside entirely new designs – nearly all of them based on a 'B' with some form of horizontal or vertical stroke overlay. Some of these designs are already in limited use, but there is no standard.  The Bitcoin Foundation Standards Committee will have to look at a number of different options, assess them, put them up for vote and eventually adopt one. Then comes the task of adding it to Unicode.  In addition to designing and implementing a new Unicode symbol, bitcoin will also require an ISO currency code standard. Currency code XBT is gaining traction for bitcoin under the ISO 4217 standard.  Standard bitcoin denominations  The second main task involves bitcoin denominations. The foundation states that the committee will have to examine denomination conventions and “come up with a recommended standard” for them.  This could prove a daunting task, as the committee will have to deal with numerous denominations rather than a single symbol. What’s more, there are already numerous denominations out there being used by developers, enthusiasts and the media.  The Bitcoin wiki currently lists a dozen denominations under 1 BTC, from 'sanbitcoin' to 'bitcoinbong' and 'satoshi'. Although many of them are used on a daily basis, they are not standardised.  The announcement was posted by Bitcoin Foundation forum admin Brad Wheeler, who cited membership director Kevin Beardsley as the go-to person for additional information.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | TECHNOLOGY,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/06/19/bitcoin-foundation-forms-committee-to-create-bitcoin-unicode-symbol,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/314196e5c004516187e91a7b8bc972dfb54ca86e-1000x594.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377379,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70VMN,1403178558,"Japan Decides Against Bitcoin Regulation, for Now","Japan’s ruling political party has announced that it is against regulating bitcoin for the time being.  The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) made the statement as an interim measure, but the final decision will be made after hearing “more opinions” on the matter, said LDP lawmaker Takuya Hirai.  ""Basically, we concluded that we will, for now, avoid a move towards legal regulation,"" Hirai told Reuters.  Mt. Gox fallout  Following the highly publicised collapse of bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, Japanese authorities found themselves in the glare of the world's media spotlight.  The exchange was incorporated in Japan and several politicians were quick to demand rigorous regulation of the currency, including Senior Finance Minister Jiro Aichi who called for an international effort on bitcoin regulation in late February. There was no shortage of opposition, however.  Japan’s regulators argue that international collaboration is necessary due to the global nature of digital currencies, which easily transcend various jurisdictions and can be used to exploit loopholes in international law.  The Liberal Democratic Party launched an investigative committee into bitcoin back in March, later issuing a statement saying that bitcoin is not a currency, but stressing that it remains taxable. Japan had started looking into ways of taxing bitcoin in the weeks following the Mt. Gox collapse.  So far none of these efforts have resulted in new legislation for bitcoin or digital currencies in general. Judging by Hirai's latest statement, the nation is certainly in no rush.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/06/19/japan-decides-against-bitcoin-regulation-for-now,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e8962b7bb15dd15e5d57412331d7ac6e611ec3d2-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377395,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70VaD,1403172323,Israeli VC Fund Offers $50k Bounty for Cost-Cutting AppCoin,"UPDATE (15:34 BST): Updated with comment from Oona Rokyta, chief purpose igniter for Aleph.      Tel Aviv-based venture capital fund Aleph has announced the first of a series of $50,000 bounties aimed at spurring activity among developers and entrepreneurs in Israel’s bitcoin space.  The fund is calling for the development of a bitcoin block chain-ready system that reduces transaction costs for an 'appcoin' to be used in conjunction with Aleph’s entrepreneur-focused social platform project, Karma. The finalist will receive a $50,000 convertible note reward.  Appcoins are defined as ""protocols with a currency or token system built in, where the token system generates the emergent value to fund the development of the protocol"", according to Vitalik Buterin, programmer, writer, and co-founder of Bitcoin Magazine.  Aleph has outlined the key requirements for the bounty, which dictates that any system must be functional and practical, serving as a model for potential deployment. Most importantly, any submission must demonstrate the capability of delivering the lowest possible effective per-transaction fees.  The bounties are open to any Israeli developer or development team. There is a 15th June entry deadline for those who wish to participate, with final submissions due by 24th September via a Github repository.  Aleph's chief purpose ignitor, Oona Rokyta, framed the decision to launch the bounties as a way to improve conditions and foster direct engagement with bitcoin entrepreneurs in Israel, saying:  ""The bounties are a vehicle to reduce development friction in the entrepreneur community with a reward that ultimately empowers the winning team to build something they have full control over.""  This bounty is the first of what Aleph expects will be a series of such offerings, which will act as catalysts for further innovation in Israel’s growing bitcoin ecosystem.  Focus on costs and practicality  Submissions, according to Aleph, need to satisfy certain key areas in order to qualify for the bounty.  The low transaction fee requirement states that any system need not provide a minimal guarantee based on single transactions. Instead, Aleph is looking for a solution that provides low cost sustainability “across many transactions and long timeframes”.  Furthermore, submissions need to be capable of integrating successfully with the bitcoin block chain, thereby enabling the network to certify transactions. Transactions need to be signed onto the block chain within 168 hours of initially taking place.  Aleph is searching for a system that is capable of being integrated at the time of review, including use within the Karma platform. Functional systems that are in the early stages of development and capable of demonstration would fit within this requirement.  Messaging role?  The Karma platform will potentially use a bitcoin-based currency that will act as a vehicle for rewarding peer-to-peer cooperation between users, the fund said.  Ultimately, the technology could form the basis of an internal messaging system within the platform as suggested in an 18th June blog post on Aleph’s official site.  But as founder Eden Shochat wrote, current costs make such a concept unfeasible from an economic perspective:  “Bitcoin transaction rates are too high if the underlying asset doesn’t have significant currency-oriented value. We found that practically-speaking the cost per transaction is $0.20 – which is fine if you’re making infrequent and sizable transactions, but not if you want to apply the bitcoin blockchain to say email correspondence or chat systems.”  Looking ahead  Rokyta told CoinDesk that, ultimately, Aleph hopes to support bitcoin innovations that address a wide range of challenges affecting the ecosystem today.  Most importantly, she said, developers need to begin looking at how digital currencies can adapt within the structures of the traditional financial system.  Rokyta explained:  ""In many ways, it's more comfortable to stay in the hacker mentality and work on wallets, white label exchanges / payment providers, and mining equipment but we believe the bigger opportunities lie in analyzing other parts of the global financial stack that are ripe for replacement.""  She added that ""the more challenging and “ripple effect” kind of bounty challenges excite us"".  Ultimately, the bounties will form part of a strategy that involves identifying both problems and solutions that are impeding broader bitcoin adoption, both in Israel and beyond. This includes working with central bankers and financial companies, as well as researching and supporting new approaches to existing challenges.
