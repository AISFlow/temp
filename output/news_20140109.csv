42376824,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6eVrT,1389302159,Overstock.com Becomes First Major Retailer to Accept Bitcoins,"UPDATED on 10th January at 18:25 (GMT)  Overstock.com CEO Patrick Byrne sent a tweet on 10th January, indicating that the company had sold $124,000 in goods via bitcoin in the 21 hours since it began accepting the cryptocurrency.    After 21 hours on @overstock.com, we've had 780 #Bitcoin orders that accounted for $124,000 in sales. Wow!      — Patrick M. Byrne (@OverstockCEO) January 10, 2014    That figure amounts to around 4% of daily revenues, based on the firm's 2012 figures.  He also added in an interview with CNN that he believed Amazon would be forced to take bitcoin at some point, as the market is growing by 30% per month.  ---------------------------------------------------------  Online retail giant Overstock.com has moved forward its plan to take bitcoin payments. The company began taking the digital currency on its site this morning. About $10,000 worth of bitcoins has reportedly already been spent since Overstock made the announcement just a couple of hours ago. The first item purchased in bitcoin, according to Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne, was a $2,700 patio set. Around 150 bitcoin-based orders were received in the first 90 minutes, he added. The firm has chosen California-based online wallet and payment processing firm Coinbase to handle its transactions, in what must surely be a major coup for the company, which posted the following on its blog:    ""This marks the largest retail Bitcoin implementation to date. For the first time ever, customers can purchase a wide selection of goods with bitcoins — from electronics to home accessories — from a trusted, branded vendor. We’re excited to serve as Overstock.com’s official digital wallet to facilitate all related transactions on their site.""          Less than three weeks ago, Byrne told CoinDesk that the firm would begin taking bitcoin payments in June or July, and at the time had not signed a payment processor. However, things accelerated after Byrne broke the news, he said. “I felt I had tipped my hand. I didn’t want someone else to beat us,” Byrne told tech publication Wired.    Pretty impressive #bitcoin volume from @Overstock: over 150 orders in the first hour. — Coinbase (@coinbase) January 9, 2014          Coinbase allegedly swung the deal by offering to fly people out to Utah to help with the integration. 40 people worked intensively around the clock from 1st January. Byrne told Forbes:  “We locked them in a room and slid pizzas under the door, and gave them hotel rooms when they needed them. The technique of swarming to form a team was incredibly efficient.”  Now that the deal has been signed, more details are available on issues such as refund handling. Bitcoin customers returning items will initially get in-store credit, reports suggest.  The deal with Coinbase also provides some clarity on how Overstock will manage its exposure when dealing with a notoriously volatile financial instrument, which acts more like a commodity than a currency at present.  In December, Byrne said that some hedging might be necessary if the firm decided to hold a position in bitcoin. However, Coinbase immediately converts bitcoins that it processes into dollars, meaning that Overstock will never hold any of the digital currency. In conversation with Bloomberg, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong admitted that the firm would be taking all the risk for Overstock.  ""There's a marketplace for these things. With liquidity and scale, all of these things become easier,"" he said, adding that the value of having a large mainstream retailer of physical goods is good for the bitcoin economy. Coinbase also resorts to over-the-counter trades with two or three institutional players, at least one of which is a miner, along with exchanges, when it needs to trade bitcoin.  Byrne had not developed a clear projection for the amount of business that it would conduct in bitcoin, but when pressed, he said that 1% was a reasonable figure.  Coinbase currently serves around 17,000 merchants with its payment processing business. Aside from using algorithmic trading to manage its own bitcoin exposure and shield retailers from volatility, one of its other unique selling propositions is ease-of-use.  Pleased to announce that #Bitcoin is live at #Overstock.com! http://t.co/mx9TFc8KNQ — Overstock.com (@Overstock) January 9, 2014  The company has created a system which interacts with the block chain, but which also provides additional benefits to those operating exclusively within its own network. It enables holders of bitcoins in Coinbase-based wallets to send bitcoins to each other using email addresses, for example. It also enables US-based users to purchase bitcoins directly from it. This is something that pure payment processing companies like BitPay do not offer.  Coinbase is also considerably more advanced in its funding than other bitcoin companies, having completed a $25m B round last month from Andreessen Horowitz. This bought the total amount raised by the company to $31.9m. This cash may help the company to deal with any state-level regulatory challenges that it faces in the future with its bitcoin sales service.  Overstock's growth story  Launched in 1999 from the ruins of bankrupt D2: Discount Direct, Utah-based Overstock began by selling purely surplus and returned merchandise via its e-commerce marketplace. Ironically given its beginnings, Byrne built the firm initially on liquidating inventory from dying dot com firms, during the technology industry recession.  The firm, which went public in 2002, has since moved into new merchandise. It offers a mixture of direct retail sales and online auctions, and also operates an affiliate program. Although it looks like a single supplier, its products come from dropship suppliers all over the country. Its 2012 revenues were $1.09bn and it lists almost a million products on its site.  @Overstock I made my first bitcoin purchase on your site already! pic.twitter.com/cuwikk5CxD — ฿en Ðoernberg (@BenDoernberg) January 9, 2014  Overstock's low pricing model, which includes cheap shipping for customers, relies on thin margins, making payment processing fees a particular burden. Bitcoin-based sales will not be entirely free, as Coinbase charges a transaction fee, but it will be cheaper than the credit card payment process which will still dominate the firm's business.  Byrne said last month that cost reduction was only one of the drivers for accepting bitcoin. The other was grounded in ideology, as he felt that bitcoin was a ""pro-freedom"" currency, with the potential to become immune to political influence. Yesterday, he added in a conversation with Forbes that access to the bitcoin community was also a driver in the decision.  Overstock’s share price rebounded slightly on the news of bitcoin acceptance, but was still off from early trading this morning, following news that it would be fined $6.8m by a California judge for allegedly misleading price comparisons on its website. That case was brought by the state of California in 2010.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/01/09/overstockcom-becomes-first-major-retailer-to-accept-bitcoins,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2cd160a0cf645d2589a0e8d08de43a7922634294-2298x1558.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376806,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6eVZr,1389290431,Coinbase Partners With BitMonet to Offer In-App Bitcoin Payments,"Digital wallet Coinbase is collaborating with open-source bitcoin payment effort BitMonet to enable in-app bitcoin transactions on Android.  The two companies are joining together to release a software development kit (SDK) that will allow users to send and receive bitcoin on the platform.  “The idea behind this SDK is to make it super simple for an Android developer to monetize virtually anything with bitcoin,” said Ankur Nandwani, the lead developer behind BitMonet.  Nandwani also claimed the kit could provide a way for bitcoin microtransactions to proliferate further. These tiny payment amounts are something credit card processors generally dislike, as their microscopic fees generate little revenue. He added:  “Coinbase supports off-the-blockchain microtransactions on the Coinbase network.”  He also indicated that this SDK will allow users to conduct marketplace-style transactions. “Not only can they sell virtual goods with bitcoins, but they can sell physical goods, without asking the user to leave the app,” said Nandwani.  The API enables developers to send money 'in the background' once they have received authorization from the consumer. “The SDK also allows payments to be made in one click, without users having to sign in to Coinbase every time they wish to make a payment,” says Nandwani.  Big business  Coinbase has long been a popular wallet for users sending and receiving bitcoin. In December, the company announced that it had surpassed over 650,000 registered users.  Coinbase also processes bitcoin payments on behalf of merchants accepting the digital currency. It recently received $25m in funding from a group of investors led by Andreesen Horowitz.  BitMonet has focused on building microtransaction-based paywalls on the web, but has now turned towards mobile payment. It is used primarily by web content owners seeking to monetize their content by implementing a paywall plugin. The WordPress version of the platform, for example, is currently being used by over 700 blogs.  Micropayments could become big business for bitcoin, but there hasn’t yet been a killer micropayment app.  Paypal and eBay  Open-source projects like BitMonet and TipperCoin have promoted the use of bitcoin for small payments. However, it may take a mobile implementation like the Coinbase-BitMonet partnership for bitcoin payments to really gain traction.  Many companies in the payment industry are looking to mobile as the future of payments, and bitcoin may play a part in this shift.  David Marcus, the president of PayPal, recently indicated that his company's survival rests upon iterating with electronic money like bitcoin. However, he said that PayPal is waiting for the regulatory framework to be further clarified before integrating bitcoin into its platform.  Additionally, eBay, PayPal’s parent company, has applied for a patent on digital “tokens”. This may be a sign that the company knows that the trinity of virtual currency, mobile technology and micropayments has a prosperous future.  via Coinbase Blog  Android Image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/01/09/coinbase-partners-with-bitmonet-to-offer-in-app-bitcoin-payments,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4197b4bf3c07e6689e1985520a69e4e7338c3a36-1000x665.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376815,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6eVhP,1389285054,Hong Kong Treasury Official Issues Bitcoin Warning,"Another day, another bitcoin warning from an Asian regulator.  This time it's Hong Kong’s Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Caejer Chan Ka-keung, who has issued a statement, warning the public that bitcoin is a highly speculative commodity which poses numerous risks.  Chan declared that anyone who decides to trade, exchange or hold bitcoins should expect high risks, as the currency does not have intrinsic value, official issuers or a real economy behind it and it tends to fluctuate wildly. However, since bitcoin is not widely used it does not pose a threat to Hong Kong’s financial system, he added.  Keeping a close eye on bitcoin  Chan stressed that the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has not identified any local banks engaged in bitcoin transactions, and they do not appear to be issuing bitcoin-related products and services, reports The Standard. Chan said:  ""We are closely monitoring its development to make sure bitcoin will not shock the stability of the local financial market.""  He added that “special attention” would be paid to money laundering activities involving bitcoin. According to The Standard, Hong Kong’s regulators have shared their opinions with their counterparts in mainland China and the region.  HKMA Regulation  Earlier this week, just hours after it emerged that Taiwan will not allow companies to install and operate bitcoin ATMs on its territory, Hong Kong regulators issued a comparatively positive notice on bitcoin ATMs.  The gist of it was simple – Hong Kong regulators view bitcoin ATMs as vending machines rather than traditional ATMs. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority told The Malay Mail that the Robocoin ATM which is to be installed in Hong Kong is “another channel for acquiring bitcoin or a vending machine”. The regulator said:  “Bitcoin is not regulated by the HKMA. Bitcoin is not a currency but a virtual commodity.”  This is good news for Robocoin, as the company is about to ship its first batch of eight ATMs to Asia. The original plan was to install them in Taiwan and Hong Kong, but Robocoin CEO Jordan Kelley pointed out that demand for bitcoin is high across the Asia.  Taiwan now appears to be out of the game, but it remains unclear which Asian markets Robocoin plans to focus on next. Hong Kong is an obvious choice, as it is a major commercial hub. It is still unclear whether we will see any bitcoin ATMs in mainland China. At this point that does not sound very likely.  Possible actions and fallout  Hong Kong has not yet followed the mainland's lead in curbing bitcoin transactions. However, some investors will be worried about the prospect of similar actions in the region, which is technically a part of China, albeit a special administrative region.  Hong Kong’s business-friendly policies led many to assume that it could act as a springboard for bitcoin adoption in mainland China, especially following the recent ban.  As a “back door” for bitcoin, Hong Kong makes a lot of sense. However, the question remains as to whether it will remain an oasis for unregulated bitcoin, or whether it will have to fall in line with Beijing. As highlighted earlier this week, Hong Kong’s gradual acceptance of bitcoin could have positive implications on China, provided local regulators don’t clamp down.

42376818,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6eVlB,1389281271,World's First Insured Bitcoin Storage Service Launches in the UK,"The world's first insured bitcoin storage service has launched in the UK, with insurance underwritten by Lloyd's of London.  Named Elliptic Vault, the service uses advanced “deep cold storage” techniques to secure its customers’ bitcoins. Deep cold storage involves the use of both strong encryption and secure physical locations.  Tom Robinson, co-founder of Elliptic, which is based in London, said:  “Securing your bitcoins involves implementing advanced encryption and even then you are still at risk of losing them. Elliptic Vault secures your bitcoins for you and is insured against theft or loss, so our customers can have peace of mind that their bitcoins are safe.""  Demand for security  Within the past week, the price of bitcoin peaked at over $1,020. Given that the price was only £125 just three months ago, many people have amassed something of a bitcoin fortune.  Unfortunately, there have been a number of instances recently of people losing their bitcoins, either due to human error, or the interference of criminals.  In November, for example, James Howells from Wales realised he had sent $6.5m worth of bitcoins to landfill after throwing out a computer hardrive that contained the wallet files and private keys required to access his coins.  [post-quote]  Other bitcoiners have seen their digital currency hoards disappear due to hackers breaking into the wallet services they use. In early November, Inputs.io suffered two hacks, which saw 4,100 BTC emptied from user wallets. Following such developments, many people are anxious to find somewhere secure to store their bitcoins.  ""We know a lot of people are concerned about the security of their bitcoin holdings,"" said Robinson. ""We are providing a service that will give people peace of mind that their bitcoins are safe and secure,"" he added.  Currently, the service is aimed at those with a relatively large collection of bitcoins, with the minimum level of cover set at £5,000. However, Robinson said his company is aiming to reduce this as the product evolves.  Insurance partner  Robinson said that, as a bitcoin company, Elliptic found it difficult to find an insurance underwriter to work with.  ""Insurance is a conservative industry, where relationships matter. It took a lot of time, but we are now working with an underwriter that understands and is comfortable with bitcoin,"" he explained.  Lloyd's of London is a UK-based corporate body that was founded in 1688. It made a pre-tax profit of £2.77bn on £25.5bn of gross written premiums in 2012 offering insurance, reinsurance, and now life assurance.  CoinDesk has seen Elliptic’s Lloyds of London insurance certificate, so can confirm it exists, but can’t vouch for its authenticity or applicability.  Customers can choose the level of bitcoin insurance they require, specified in pounds sterling (although this service is available to those based both in and outside the UK). Users pay an annual rate of 2%, which is paid in bitcoin, in monthly instalments at the end of each month.  The insurance offered covers loss of bitcoins, whether caused by any negligence by Elliptic or due to theft by a third party.  If users have to make a claim, their bitcoins would be valued at the time of the claim, using the BTC/USD exchange rate on Bitstamp, and the GBP/USD exchange rate. Elliptic said it uses the BTC/USD exchange rate (rather than BTC/GBP), as the US bitcoin exchange market is the most liquid.  Previous life  Robinson worked for some time on UK-based virtual currency exchange BitPrice, but was unable to bring the company to launch due to difficulties on finding a UK banking partner willing to go anywhere near a bitcoin exchange.  He has now changed the business model and rebranded the company as Elliptic. Elliptic Vault is the company's first product, but it hopes to expand to offer a number of virtual currency-related services.  A statement on the Elliptic site reads:    ""Thank you for your support for BitPrice and of our mission to establish a fully-regulated digital currency exchange. We sincerely hope you'll continue to support us as we move forward with a new name and new services. While an exchange is not Elliptic's first service, we remain committed to achieving this goal.      Together with the digital currency community we continue to actively work with regulators and government, to ensure a sustainable future for digital currencies, both in the UK and globally.""    Robinson said he wants to create a ""suite"" of services that make digital currencies easier to use, more secure and more powerful.  This article should not be viewed as an endorsement of Elliptic Vault, please do your own research before considering investing any funds in this service.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Emily Spaven,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/01/09/worlds-first-insured-bitcoin-storage-service-launches-in-the-uk,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2be1dac675c3a77e28c65913e259e7fdc50a574a-1024x768.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376822,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6eVox,1389277765,Bitcoin Miners Ditch Ghash.io Pool Over Fears of 51% Attack,"UPDATED on 9th January at 18:11 (GMT)  Bitcoin miners around the world are starting to leave the Ghash.io bitcoin pool following a significant increase in the pool’s hash share.  According to Blockchain.info, Ghash.io accounted for more than 42% of bitcoin mining power a day ago, but over the past 24 hours its share has dropped to 38%.  The fact that a single pool has such a high share has prompted some bitcoin miners to voice their concerns on social media and the mining community is starting to take notice. If a single entity ends up controlling more than 50% of the network’s computing power, it could – theoretically – wreak havoc on the whole network.  Bad maths  A so-called “51% attack” could, in theory, allow the attacker to reverse transactions, make double-spend transactions, prevent confirmations or even prevent other miners from mining valid blocks. It would corrupt the blockchain and render the whole system unsafe. However, this it is all speculative – as it has never been done before.  In theory, the potential attack would work if the attacker managed to gain control of more than 50% of the network’s computing power. However, even with 40%, an attacker would stand a good chance of overcoming 6-deep confirmed transactions.  If such an attack was to be carried out, the damage would be irreparable.  CEX.io moves to reassure community  CEX.io  , the owner of Ghash.io, has come under criticism for its failure to address the concerns. Many miners and bitcoin enthusiasts are urging fellow miners to leave the pool, but so far it does not appear that many of them are ready to heed the warning. Ghash.io has a somewhat chequered track record, as it was used in a double-spend attack last year. However, CEX.io insists that it had no affiliation with the attack and that it condemns such actions, as they harm the bitcoin network.  CEX.io rewrote the Ghash.io engine after it gained control of the platform. Earlier this year CEX.io said it would do “everything possible to prevent pool capacity manipulation in the future.”  This afternoon CEX.io issued a statement in an effort to reassure miners and investors:  “Although the increase of hash-power in the pool is considered to be a good thing, reaching 51% of all hashing power is serious threat to the bitcoin community. Ghash.io will take all necessary precautions to prevent reaching 51% of all hashing power, in order to maintain stability of the bitcoin network.”  Ghash.io insists that it has put in place a plan to ensure that it never crosses the 51% mark. It will temporarily stop accepting new independent mining facilities to the pool and it will implement a feature allowing existing users to mine bitcoins from other pools, allowing them to use CEX.io hardware in the pool of their choosing.  Ghash.io insists that it does not have any intentions of executing a 51% attack, as it would do serious damage to the Bitcoin community, and the company itself. To the contrary, they want to expand bitcoin community and utilise the hashing power to develop a greater bitcoin economic structure. Ghash.io goes on to say that it “sees no benefit” in having a 51% stake in mining.  Preventing 51% attacks  There are a number of ways to eliminate threat of 51% attacks, although technically speaking they should be called 50%+1 attacks. Miner boycotts are proven to work, but they cannot be relied upon all the time. Calls to pull out of Ghash.io seem to be working and it is already back to 38%, down from 42% less than a day ago.  Bitcoin developer Vitalik Buterin told CoinDesk:  “We don't need a public service announcement warning people not to join CEX.io; we need a PSA telling CEX.io to solo mine. No one with over 5% hashpower (arguably even 1%) should be doing anything but solo mining.”  Buterin argues that the best way of going about it would be to create a one-click application that installs a miner, then installs the peer-to-peer mining pool and a simple user interface. The application should be cross-platform, covering Windows, Mac and major Linux distributions.  Following this, a simple software package that would allow users to create their own mining pools should be developed and released as an open-source project. This way, anyone would be able to start a centralized mining pool capable of competing with big pools like Ghash.io.  People should then contribute bounties to both, Buterin argues. “If I see a credible effort, I would throw in a few hundred dollars myself,” he added.  Buterin is not alone. Quite a few miners seem to believe that a true cross-platform open-source executable that allows peer-to-peer mining is the way to go. One Reddit user is offering 10 BTC to anyone who develops such a solution, or an open-source pool that allows connections to existing mining platforms, with a peer-to-peer backend system.

42394592,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bwDSzb,1389272424,Still Don't Get Bitcoin? Here's an Explanation Even a 5-Year-Old Will Understand,"If you still can’t figure out what the heck a bitcoin is, this simple explanation for a five-year-old may help you …  How does bitcoin work?  We’re sitting on a park bench. It’s a great day. I have one apple with me, I give it to you.  You now have one apple and I have zero. That was simple, right?  How to Store Your Bitcoin  The Solution  What if we gave this ledger to everybody? Instead of the ledger living on a Blizzard computer, it’ll live in everybody’s computers. All the transactions that have ever happened, from all time, in digital apples, will be recorded in it.  You can’t cheat it. I can’t send you digital apples I don’t have, because then it wouldn’t sync up with everybody else in the system. It’d be a tough system to beat. Especially if it got really big.  Plus, it’s not controlled by one person, so I know there’s no one that can just decide to give himself more digital apples. The rules of the system were already defined at the beginning.  And the code and rules are open source – kinda like the software used in your mom’s Android phone. Or kinda like Wikipedia. It’s there for smart people to maintain, secure, improve, and check.  You could participate in this network too – updating the ledger and making sure it all checks out. For the trouble, you could get like 25 digital apples as a reward. In fact, that’s the only way to create more digital apples in the system.  I simplified quite a bit … But that system I explained exists. It’s called the Bitcoin protocol. And those digital apples are the bitcoins within the system. Fancy! So, did you see what happened?  Read more: Bitcoin 101: How do Bitcoin Transactions Work?  What does the public ledger enable?  1) It’s open source, remember? The total number of apples was defined in the public ledger at the beginning. I know the exact amount that exists. Within the system, I know they are limited (scarce).  2) When I make an exchange I now know that digital apple certifiably left my possession and is now completely yours. I used to not be able to say that about digital things. It will be updated and verified by the public ledger.  3)Because it’s a public ledger,I didn’t need Uncle Tommy (third-party) to make sure I didn’t cheat, or make extra copies for myself, or send apples twice, or thrice…  Within the system, the exchange of a digital apple is now just like the exchange of a physical one. It’s now as good as seeing a physical apple leave my hand and drop into your pocket. Just like on the park bench, the exchange involved two people only. You and me , we didn’t need Uncle Tommy there to make it valid.  In other words, it behaves like a physical object.  But you know what’s cool? It’s still digital.  We can now deal with 1,000 apples, or 1 million apples, or even .0000001 apples. I can send it with a click of a button, and I can still drop it in your digital pocket if I was in Nicaragua and you were all the way in New York.  I can even make other digital things ride on top of these digital apples! It’s digital after all. Maybe I can attach some text on it – a digital note. Or maybe I can attach more important things; like say a contract, or a stock certificate, or an ID card …  So this is great! How should we treat or value these “digital apples”? They’re quite useful aren’t they?  Well, a lot of people are arguing over it now. There’s debate between this and that economic school, between politicians, between programmers. Don’t listen to all of them though. Some people are smart; some are misinformed. Some say the system is worth a lot; some say it’s actually worth zero. Some guy actually put a hard number on it: $1,300 per apple. Some say it’s digital gold; some say it's a currency. Others say they’re just like tulips. Some people say it’ll change the world; some say it’s just a fad.  I have my own opinion about it, but that’s a story for another time.  Hey kid, you now know more about Bitcoin than most.

42376812,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6eVg9,1389263754,Are Passwords Robust Enough to Protect Your Bitcoins?,"In this age of hacks and scandals, are passwords really capable of protecting your bitcoins?  Each bitcoin address has a corresponding private key, which enables the owner to spend the bitcoins in it, but this private key also needs protecting.  The private key for your public bitcoin address is crucial, because without it, you will lose access to your coins. You can’t keep this key in your head, though, because it's a long string of alphanumeric gibberish, which is rather impractical to memorise.  Some people protect their bitcoins by storing them in paper wallets, embedding them in a printed QR code that can be scanned when necessary. That’s a good option, but it leaves the private key physically vulnerable to theft, fire, or coffee.  Another option is to use encrypted passwords, a capability that some bitcoin wallets include. Passwords can also be used to protect other important bitcoin-related assets, such as accounts on an exchange. However, the problem here is that passwords aren’t that secure either: they’re often far easier to crack than you’d expect.  Memorable information  Password cracking software uses dictionary attacks to access passwords by brute force, by trying millions of combinations of known words. Thus, it’s naive to use “password”, “12345”, or the name of your dog as your password – someone, somewhere, will probably have that on a list, unless your dog happens to be called “8%tRuiy0P” rather than “Buffy”.  This Ars Technica article walks through how relatively talentless password crackers can use dictionaries to try and pieces together user passphrases.  But wait – your online exchange or web wallet encrypts your password, so you’re already protected, right?  Don’t be so sure. Many applications that store a password will use what’s known as a hashing function, passing the password through a mathematical calculation to produce a string of characters known as a hash. The software then stores that hash.  [post-quote]  Whenever anyone tries to gain access to something by entering a password, (say, a bitcoin private key, or an account on an exchange), the software runs the password through the same hashing function, and then compares the string produced with the string that was originally stored.  No two passwords would produce the same hash – so, theoretically, only people with access to the password could produce a match.  However, as a particular password will always produce the same hash, password crackers can simply hash all of the words in their dictionaries, to produce what’s known as a rainbow table.  That’s a collection of millions of hashes, cross-referenced to the passwords that produced them. That’s how password thieves like those who stole LinkedIn’s list of hashes could decode the passwords. There are techniques, such as password salting and using longer passwords, that can make this lookup process far more difficult, but it’s still useful for password crackers.  Even the seemingly clever passwords or passphrases that you use to protect your bitcoin wallet can be vulnerable to attack. That idea of using random letters or substituting the number ‘1’ for an ‘l’ or an ‘i’? Forget it. The software has rules for testing against that.  Some more savvy people will use two or three words strung together, perhaps with a number or stray letter thrown in. “Angrybadger1125” sounds like a great password, doesn’t it? “When I was a boy I always wanted to be an astronaut” sounds even better. But these passwords aren’t invincible.  Power and efficiency  The problem, as outlined by the University of Cambridge’s Joseph Bonneau, and cited by security guru Bruce Schneier, is that password cracking today is a function of two things: power, and efficiency.  The first means throwing computing power at something (working harder), while the second involves using more sophisticated word matching models (working smarter).  Some people have even mined websites to try and find special interest-related words and passphrases that can be added to lists, and used to augment those huge dictionaries.  “Passwords are the democracy of authentication technologies – they're the worst thing available, except for everything else,” says Dan Kaminsky, a security researcher most famous for finding what amounted to a zero-day vulnerability for the whole web in the form of a DNS vulnerability in 2008.  So, if you thought your password stood in the way of your private key and an army of online crooks, think again. But the point is that they’re likely to deter enough people to still make them worthwhile.  “The reality is that passwords are highly likely to actually work in the field, which is why we're addicted to them,” Kaminsky says.  Mike Hearn  , one of bitcoin’s core developers, agrees. He gives an example of wallet-stealing malware that was circulating some time ago.  “Adding password-based wallet encryption put a stop to that – even though, in theory, it shouldn't work very well. Well-crafted malware can log your keystrokes and steal the password, while weak passwords could be brute-forced.”  He continues: “But in practice, it seems to have raised the bar enough to buy time for the development of stronger techniques, like the Trezor.”  Trezor  is a hardware device designed to store a master key for accessing your bitcoin wallet, which never divulges any secrets to the host machine. Hearn hopes that this product, or successors to it, will evolve into more general security tools in future.  “A secure display, CPU and buttons in portable form are exactly what is needed to solve many tricky security issues.”  Kaminsky also agrees that hardware currency being built to protect bitcoin users will be useful for other security problems: “I have nothing I can recommend directly, but I expect that to change in a small number of months,” he says.  Two-factor authentication  Hardware has been used for protection before, of course. Two-factor authentication (something you know, plus something you have) is a mainstay of conventional security.  Biometrics (something you are) have also been used to authenticate people, granting them access to privileged resources. But both of these are now fraught with problems, both related to the NSA.  Reports recently surfaced  that Apple’s iOS devices are subject to attack from the NSA, which has developed malware which can be implanted on one of the company’s devices and used to access its internal workings.  It isn’t yet clear whether this would enable an attacker to access the biometric fingerprint information on the latest iPhone, but then, hackers have already compromised this, making it largely moot.  What’s more worrying is that encryption technology developed by RSA is now suspected to be back-doored by the NSA, putting huge swathes of currently-used infrastructure at risk. RSA denies collusion, but it doesn’t bode well for at least some commonly-used forms of 2FA.  “2FA is bigger than RSA,” protests Kaminsky, adding:  “You might as well be asking whether security is over because now we know one security company may or may not have known (we have no idea) they were being used in this manner.”  That’s true, but it begs the question: if RSA was back-doored, who else was the NSA also accessing? And who can we trust with 2FA protection?  “There are several proposals for 2FA, many of them being open source (such as Google's Authenticator) and so less likely to be hiding a backdoor,” says Sergio Lerner, a security expert and frequent contributor to bitcoin’s security efforts. The software inside Trezor is also open source.  “And if you fear that 2FA is not enough, then you can use 3FA (a token, a OTP smartphone app, and a password)!” he says. This multi-channel, out-of-band authentication is a feature of BitGo’s secure wallet.  Cat and mouse  Security is never a zero-sum game. It’s a constant cat-and-mouse game, between those trying to protect systems, and those trying to break them.  There are alternatives to passwords that can work, but design transparency is key. And passwords are unlikely to go away, meaning that we’re going to have to find a way to try and use them properly.  Schneier has some good advice here. “When I was a boy, I ALWAYS wanted to be an airline pilot” isn’t a great choice, but you can make it into a password unlikely to be in any table, by taking the first letters of the words, as long as the software or online app allows the format that it produces.  “WIwab,IAw2ba@p” should keep them fooled for at least a little longer (don’t use this now – choose your own), but is still easy to recall if you know the phrase that it came from.  If you’re storing enough money in a bitcoin address that it would hurt to lose it, and open source 2FA isn’t available, such precautions seem worth the effort, don’t they?

42376804,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6eVXL,1389259823,New Zealand Winery Becomes First in Southern Hemisphere to Accept Bitcoin,"A small high-end winery in North Canterbury, New Zealand, is the first wine business in the southern hemisphere to accept bitcoin.  The decision was made to ease transactions for the company's strong domestic and international customer base.  Pyramid Valley Vineyards  produces collectable wines in New Zealand and sees the new currency as a development in line with its innovative approach to the wine business. Just last week, California's Mondo Cellars winery also embraced bitcoin by selling shares to fund expansion of its operations.  The Rollingdale winery in British Columbia, Canada, has traded bitcoins for bottles since February, and was the first in North America to do so. The Picnic Wine Company in California's Napa Valley also announced it would accept bitcoin back in April.  Caine Thompson, managing director of Pyramid Valley, explained: “We live in exciting times, and bitcoin is a movement that is gaining huge international traction as a currency that is borderless.”  For a business based in a small and fairly isolated market, that is looking to sell to all parts of the world, a borderless currency has a lot of appeal.  “We’re increasingly getting requests from our international customers to be able to pay with bitcoin, particularly for our exclusive Home Collection wines. They don’t want to be worried about exchange rates and costly transaction fees.”  Thompson said his company had “positioned itself on freedom and ‘outside of the square’ winemaking and thinking,"" adding that this matches the kind of ""disruptive innovation"" taking place in other industries.  “Bitcoin is a logical fit that we need to be a part of. As a company that is increasing our customer base around the world, it makes sense to accept payment in bitcoin, especially when we sell our wines across the globe direct through our website.""  Pyramid Valley began accepting bitcoin on 9th December 2013. Thompson claims results over the holiday period were healthy, both online and in-person via payments with bitcoin smartphone apps.  ""We have been surprised with level of interest in bitcoin and the amount of people that are purchasing with bitcoin. In the December period bitcoin sales accounted for 9% of our online sales, which is significant. Transactions are predominantly from New Zealand, with growing purchases each month from offshore customers.  ""It's been a fascinating experience where we have accessed a whole new market of customers who are purchasing with bitcoin who are now huge Pyramid Valley supporters.""  Pyramid Valley Vineyards was established in 2000 by Mike and Claudia Weersing and has quickly become one of New Zealand’s leading and ""most provocative"" wine producers.  Thompson concluded: “We continually challenge the status quo, push boundaries and the current paradigm. When this is at the core of your culture, it makes for one incredibly exciting company with freedom.”",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/01/09/new-zealand-winery-becomes-first-in-southern-hemisphere-to-accept-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/edf31ded2e49c2df3925f45c77bdcc587508e777-1000x742.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376809,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6eVb7,1389252374,Congressional Report Warns of Potential Bitcoin Threat to US Dollar,"A Congressional report quietly released last month suggests that bitcoin could be a threat to US monetary policy, and makes the case for continued central banking control.  The report, Bitcoin: Questions, Answers, and Analysis of Legal Issues, was published by the Congressional Research Service, which produces research reports for US policy makers. It argues for the benefits of a single, incumbent currency (the US dollar), for stability.  “If greater use of bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) leads to multiple monetary units, these benefits could be threatened, particularly if these new currencies continue to exhibit a high degree of price volatility,” the paper says.  The authors suggest that too much bitcoin usage would lead to a tightening of monetary policy, because it could increase the money supply of US dollars.  This would depend on a couple of factors, though. Firstly, enough people would need to be using bitcoin for it to have an effect. At the moment, the bitcoin economy is highly illiquid, leading to the volatility that we’ve seen in the last year.  Secondly, bitcoins must be used as a currency in their own right. If they are bought into circulation when exchanged for fiat money, and then taken back out of circulation when users ‘cash out’ back into fiat, the effect on the money supply would be small, the authors suggest.  If, however, bitcoins are substituted for dollars on a more systematic, long-term basis, the situation would change, because it would decrease the need to hold dollars, and increase the supply of fiat money. The danger, according to the report, is that this could reduce the demand for dollars, which would affect the rate of circulation. This would confound things for the Federal Reserve, which effects monetary policy by adjusting the banking system’s available dollar reserves.  “In this case, for the Fed to maintain the same degree of monetary accommodation, it would need to undertake a compensating tightening of monetary policy,” the report said. “At a minimum, a substantial use of bitcoins could make the measurement of velocity more uncertain, and judging the appropriate stance of monetary policy uncertain.”  Challenges to widespread adoption  But the paper questions bitcoin’s ability to become a major currency for several reasons. One of these is simply because the dollar is already highly liquid and well established, and so difficult to displace. This isn’t insurmountable, though, it admits.  Serial bitcoin entrepreneur Erik Voorhees says that bitcoin’s outpacing of the dollar is certain.  “It is a better money, and all the guns and violence and central planning the government throws at it cannot stave off the laws of economics,” he says. However, he predicts this displacement happening gradually, from the margins.  Stephen Pair, co-founder and CTO at payment processor BitPay, discounts another of the report’s criticisms of bitcoin: its volatile pricing. The authors say that this makes it more of a speculative instrument than a currency. Although it is an issue, he says that software tools make it easy to hedge exposure.  “What remains to be seen is which national currency will be preferred for use in limiting that exposure.” he says. “So far it is the US dollar, but that could quickly change if another central bank began issuing their currency directly on the bitcoin block chain and facilitated the development of an options market around their currency.”  The paper also perceives another barrier to bitcoin's widespread adoption as a currency: a deflationary trait, which it says could lead to hoarding. “This possible outcome highlights the likely importance of the economy’s principal currency being elastic, its supply increasing and decreasing to meet the changing needs of the economy, and of the important role of the central bank in implementing such a monetary policy,” it warns.  Voorhees argues that bitcoin simply encourages more careful consumption, incentivizing savings. “Though most publicized economists will wholeheartedly claim this is a fault and calamity of Bitcoin, those of us who understand bitcoin politely disagree,” he adds.  Pair also disagrees with the hoarding argument. “We have data to back it up,” he said. “During the recent increase in value of bitcoin, we saw our daily transaction volumes more than triple. As the value of bitcoin rises, it creates a wealth effect and people begin to spend their bitcoins.”  The report also leaves the door open for prosecuting bitcoin under Counterfeiting Criminal Statutes, and the Stamp Payments Act of 1862, 18 U.S.C. §337 (something which Wired investigates further here), in addition to saying that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) could have the authority to regulate bitcoin. However, while it highlights these as possibilities, it stops short of recommending any such moves.  “If Congress reversed course and no longer wanted to get the benefits of bitcoin while minimizing its risks, the laws that could be used against bitcoin use would have to be stretched, perhaps to the breaking point,” responded the Bitcoin Foundation in a statement.

42376810,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6eVcN,1389236142,Singapore Government: This is How We Intend to Tax Bitcoin,"Singapore has given guidance on how it intends to tax bitcoin transactions for businesses and merchants, becoming one of the first governments in the world to do so.  Singapore-based bitcoin brokerage Coin Republic received an official response to its requests to the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) for clarification on how to handle capital gains, earnings, and even GST (aka VAT, or sales tax) on bitcoin exchanges and bitcoin related sales.  Coin Republic provided the IRAS with a number of detailed scenarios to match its business activities, and asked the authority to review the tax implications for each.  ""The guidance which IRAS laid out is rational and well thought out. As a business owner, I can clearly account for my earnings on Bitcoin trades for my clients and my own positions and pay the proper taxes,"" said David Moskowitz, Coin Republic's founder.  As a regional financial services hub and IT center, Singapore could provide a useful model for authorities in other countries to follow. It has also adopted a cautious but sensible approach to bitcoin so far -- after initially warning people against using bitcoin, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) later declared it would not interfere in people's or businesses' ability to transact in bitcoin, essentially opening the country up as a base for bitcoin entrepreneurship.  Defining bitcoin  There were some interesting points in the IRAS's response. Some highlights were: Companies will be taxed on income based on bitcoin sales, as though bitcoins were products. When used as an investment, though, they are treated as capital gains (Singapore has no capital gains tax for non-property investments). GST rules could vary depending on the level of service an exchange provides (see below).  When accepted as payment for goods and services, bitcoins are counted as barter exchange. This includes digital products like music, but not in-game virtual products unless they are exchanged for money or other goods in the real world.  The IRAS reminded Coin Republic that bitcoins do not fit the definition of 'money' or 'currency', so supplying them is seen as a good/service for taxation purposes rather than a currency exchange. Also, companies (eg: payment processors) deemed to be overseas companies, or operating from outside of Singapore, will not be taxed.  Moskowitz said he hoped the GST regulations would be reconsidered to prevent bitcoin businesses being double or even triple-taxed: Once upon acquiring the bitcoins, again when using them as payment, and again when selling bitcoins for cash.    ""Ideally, I'd like to see GST to only apply when bitcoin is exchanged for goods or services with a GST registered vendor – that's when an exchange of value or service actually takes place,"" he said.      ""The exchange of currency to bitcoin is simply an exchange of stores of value, similar to investment grade gold or silver – which is already GST exempt in Singapore.""    Is taxation possible?  There has been much discussion around whether any government even has the power to tax transactions on an essentially anonymous form of money. Libertarian-leaning bitcoin fans often scoff at the idea. More pragmatic businesspeople see taxation as inevitable at some point, arguing that it is another step towards legitimacy and would lead to greater adoption in the business world.  It's important to remember that business transactions in hard cash are already subject to taxation in most countries, despite the anonymous nature of cash making it impossible to notice every small interaction. Technically, the same applies to any form of payment you receive for goods or services, even if it is barter. Try to run a multi-million dollar business purely in cash though, and you will soon attract the tax authorities' attention.  [post-quote]  Thus it is hard to imagine a significant online retailer or other business accepting bitcoin without some form of tax assessment in place. At least, not without the kind of creative jurisdictional interplay employed by large corporations and offshore small businesses.  Other countries  So far, the world's governments and central banks have put more energy into persuading the public that bitcoin is risky and not a currency, or restricting its use, than formulating rules to tax its transactions.  A few countries have issued statements where the exact tax rules hinge on whether bitcoin is classifed as a virtual currency, asset, or good. Slovenia (the home of Bitstamp) has said bitcoin is a virtual currency but not a 'monetary asset', and bitcoin income would be taxable.  Germany  has said it regards bitcoin a 'private money' or a 'financial instrument', and the Swiss parliament is ""considering"" a move to have bitcoin officially recognized as a currency.  Here are some more details on Singapore's tax plans, based on Coin Republic's email exchange:  Income Tax  Companies in the business of buying and selling bitcoins will be taxed based on the gains from sales of those bitcoins. On the other hand, if the bitcoins are part of the company’s investment portfolio acquired for long term investment purposes, the gains from the sales will be capital in nature, and thus not taxable.  GST (aka VAT or sales tax)  The sale (including the exchange) of bitcoins in return for a consideration in money or in kind is a taxable supply of services subject to GST. If the seller is a GST-registered person, he would have to account for output tax on the sale of bitcoins made in the course or furtherance of his business.  Where bitcoins are accepted as payment for real goods or services (or digitized items like online music), such transactions are treated as a barter exchange. GST should be accounted for on the individual supplies made (ie: the supply of bitcoins and the supply of real goods or services) if the parties involved are GST-registered persons. However if the bitcoins are used to exchange for virtual goods or services within the virtual gaming world, as a concession, the supply of bitcoins will not be taxed until the bitcoins are exchanged for real monies, goods or services.  As bitcoin does not fall within the definition of ‘money’ or ‘currency’ under the GST Act, a supply of bitcoins is not a supply of money and would be disregarded for GST purposes. The supply of bitcoins would be treated as a supply of services as it involves the granting of the interest in or right over the bitcoins.  The GST treatment of the supply of bitcoins will depend on whether the company is acting as an agent or principal in the transaction. If the company merely facilitates and is acting as an agent in the bitcoin trade (eg: bitcoin exchange transfers bitcoins directly to a customer’s wallet), then GST is chargeable only on the commission fees received. However if the company is acting as a principal in the bitcoin trade (eg: it buys and onward-sells bitcoins to the customer), GST is chargeable on the full amount received, ie: the sale of bitcoins and commission fees.
