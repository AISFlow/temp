While the South American nation did not confirm exactly what this false information constitutes, the superintendent of Venezuelan Cryptoassets and Related Activities – recently created to oversee the work, which was first announced last month – told Reuters that the government was rejecting a white paper which purported to explain how the petro worked.  The white paper for the petro has not been released yet, he said, but Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro will do so ""soon.""  A Reddit post from roughly two weeks ago claimed to include a link to the petro's white paper, and the document itself – unconfirmed by the Venezuelan government as of yet – appears to be hosted on the government's official website. Whether this document is an early version of the expected official release remains to be seen.  The controversial ""petro token"" was announced last month, with the stated goal of bypassing financial sanctions amidst a years-long economic decline. Venezuela's current fiat currency, the bolivar, has been subject to intense inflation, with the government recently issuing a 100,000 unit note.

As a result, India is now looking to tax capital gains, as well as receive information about how much people own in cryptocurrencies and where their funds are located.

At the time, the Indian Income Tax Department said it was also looking for instances of money laundering.  While officials have decried bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the past, India’s official stance remains unclear. Attempts to clarify its status have been made, with at least two petitions and an Indian Supreme Court note all asking for some guidance on regulations.  Despite these moves, India has not released any new regulations surrounding the trade of cryptocurrency. According to Reuters, a state tax official, B.R.

Shin-ichiro Kengaku, TEPCO's managing executive officer and chief of global innovation and investments, said in a statement:  ""We are excited to work with Electron to explore and obtain additional know-how on blockchain that has the potential to significantly impact the energy market.

42380279,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MfZH,1516374012,PBoC Reportedly Orders Payment Services to Stop Serving Crypto Traders,"The Business Administration Department of the People's Bank of China (PBoC) has reportedly issued a document today requiring payment providers in Beijing to stop facilitating cryptocurrency trading activities.  The news, first reported by Securities Times, a state-owned media outlet launched by the Communism Party mouthpiece the People's Daily, said the document requires payment companies to start internal investigations to ascertain if cryptocurrency trading activities are being conducted via their payment services. If so, they should subsequently cease servicing those accounts, the document states.  Citing sources familiar with the matter, the news source said the document also requires these companies to report on their investigation and implementation by Jan. 20.  The document, if genuine, may come as part of plans to implement a wider ban on China's crypto trading scene that was reportedly sought by the PBoC's vice governor Pan Gongsheng.  Another China-based outlet, the Economic Observer, reported that it has confirmed the veracity of the document through another source close to the central bank.  The Business Administration Department is a Beijing-based division within the PBoC that specifically implements monetary polices in the country's capital.  According to Securities Times, the document requires payment services within its jurisdiction to comply with its request. While it might appear that the rule only applies to services registered in Beijing, the document requires the firms to extend the investigations across their other branches.  It remains unclear at this stage what immediate impact this may have on China's remaining cryptocurrency trading activity. Following the ban on initial coin offerings by the PBoC last year, China's cryptocurrency exchange activities have mostly shifted to over-the-counter (OTC) trading.  For example, Huobi and OKCoin, previously two of the biggest order book exchanges in China, now offer platforms where Chinese residents can advertise their buy and sell orders, and the resulting transactions in cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies are separated. Trading partners would send Chinese Yuan through payment tools such as bank transfers, WeChat Pay and AliPay, which appear to be like any normal transactions between two individuals.  Other OTC platforms also exist through the group chat function of messaging giant WeChat and Telegram. With the data center of the latter service being outside the jurisdiction of the Chinese government, it has become a popular venue for OTC trading among Chinese investors.

The cases, both filed in the U.S. federal court in the New York Eastern District, are the latest move from the country's derivatives regulator in bringing closer scrutiny over activities involving cryptocurrencies, which the agency regulates as commodities.  The CFTC and the Securities and Exchange Commission published a joint statement on the lawsuits, attributed to SEC Co-Enforcement Directors Stephanie Avakian and Steven Peikin and CFTC Enforcement Director James McDonald, who noted:  ""When market participants engage in fraud under the guise of offering digital instruments – whether characterized as virtual currencies, coins, tokens, or the like – the SEC and the CFTC will look beyond form, examine the substance of the activity and prosecute violations of the federal securities and commodities laws. The Divisions of Enforcement for the SEC and CFTC will continue to address violations and bring actions to stop and prevent fraud in the offer and sale of digital instruments.""  In one case, the CFTC alleged that Dillon Michael Dean from Colorado and his company, Entrepreneurs Headquarters Limited, collected more than $1.1 million in bitcoin from over 600 people as part of a pooled investment vehicle for trading commodity interests. The pool was said to invest in binary options contracts, according to the complaint. However, the CFTC alleged that the defendants misappropriated the funds.  In the second case, Patrick Kerry McDonnell from New York and the company CabbageTech, are being sued by the CFTC for allegedly absconding with customers' digital assets.  According to the complaint, the agency alleged that McDonnell branded himself as a cryptocurrency investment expert with trading advice that could result in highly attractive returns on investment. For example, the complaint said that, in one case, McDonnell allegedly claimed a return of 300 percent with his trading tips.  Subsequently the regulator alleged that soon after customers sent in money and cryptocurrencies for his advisory services, the defendant cut off communications with customers and ""simply misappropriated"" the funds.  In both cases, according to the complaints, the CFTC said neither of the two defendants and their companies had previously registered with the agency. And to a report from Reuters, a third CFTC case is still under seal.  These cases aren't the first time the agency has acted on alleged wrongdoings involving cryptocurrencies. Last year, the regulator also brought a suit against another man for an alleged bitcoin Ponzi scheme.  In addition, the CFTC also indicated last year that, in the future, tokens issued through initial coin offerings may also be treated as commodities.  The filings for the two cases can be found below:    CFTC vs Dillon Michael Dean by CoinDesk on Scribd      CFTC vs Patrick K.

While Caviar’s website stated it would only sell its tokens to non-U.S. residents, its controls were not stringent enough to actually prevent American residents from buying tokens. The filing claims that at least two U.S. residents were able to participate in the ICO.  The proceeds from the token sale would be used to ""flip"" properties, according to the Boston Herald. Caviar was to also invest in cryptocurrencies on a longer-term basis.  The filing continues that, contrary to the firm's claims that Caviar tokens were not securities, the way the company was set up makes the tokens a ""textbook example of a conventional security,"" and therefore needed to be registered as such or classified as exempt from registration. Bensonoff had not registered or received an exemption for his token scheme.  According to the filing, Bensonoff had raised $3 million of a planned $24 million via the token sale.  Caviar is registered as an entity in the Cayman Islands, but Bensonoff has never visited the country and the firm has had no physical locations there, according to the filing, which continued on to say Bensonoff claimed to have registered in the islands because ""we decided that that's a jurisdiction that we felt comfortable with.""  Massachusetts' Secretary of the Commonwealth, William Galvin, said the filing is a warning for anyone else who would use an ICO to circumvent securities laws, according to the Herald.  In a statement to BizJournal, Bensonoff said he did not think Caviar violated Massachusetts securities laws, and that he had been talking to the Secretary's office.  He continued:  ""We expect to continue that dialogue and believe that we can meet the Secretary's concerns regarding Massachusetts purchasers.""

42380283,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MfeJ,1516366809,2018's Challenge: Promote Responsible Blockchain Innovation,"Beth Knickerbocker is chief innovation officer at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the U.S. agency that charters, regulates and supervises all national banks.  The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review.      Innovation in financial services is critical to meeting the nation's changing consumer and business needs, and the OCC's Office of Innovation is working to promote responsible innovation in the federal banking system.  Operational since January 2017, the Office of Innovation is responsible for improving the agency's ability to identify, understand and respond to financial innovation affecting the federal banking system and serves as the agency's central point of contact and clearinghouse for innovation-related matters.  Early last year, the Office hosted ""Office Hours"" in technology hubs New York and San Francisco with more than 40 banks and non-banks to gain a better understanding of common issues and concerns that these entities face regarding innovation-related products, services, and emerging technologies.  The goal of the meetings was to provide these entities with candid regulatory advice and give participants a welcoming environment in which to express their views. Other topics discussed at these informal meetings included partnering with banks, third-party risk management expectations and how best to prepare to operate in a highly-regulated environment.  Action points  A dedicated web page was established on OCC.gov with links to innovation guides for community banks, financial technology companies (for example, marketplace lenders and startups in the blockchain technology and cryptocurrency space), and other non-bank institutions.  The page describes the OCC's Responsible Innovation Framework and provides links to innovation-related news, speeches, and special purpose national bank charter information. Banks, non-bank companies, and fintech companies can contact the office through a dedicated e-mail address or phone number.  In addition to Office Hours, the OCC participated in more than 50 outreach events related to fintech and responsible innovation. Additional outreach and awareness efforts included collaborating and sharing information with other domestic and international regulators.  Internally, the Office conducts research, develops awareness materials, and maintains a library of fintech and innovation-related news articles, podcasts, and other resources. This material is available to the OCC workforce so that examiners, in particular, are prepared to discuss innovation topics with bankers and to answer questions about the OCC's responsible innovation efforts.  The Office is also working with the OCC's Continuing Education department on updating training plans to help OCC staff learn more about responsible innovation.  In March 2017, the OCC published a draft supplement to the Comptroller's Licensing Manual describing its proposed approach to chartering fintech companies.  The draft supplement clarifies the agency's approach to evaluating national bank charter applications from fintech companies, describes how it would supervise these banks and articulates expectations for how these banks would ensure fair access and fair treatment for all customers.  To date, the OCC has not decided whether to exercise its authority to grant special purpose national bank charters to non-depository fintech companies under 12 CFR 5.20(e)(1).  In a July speech to the Exchequer Club, Acting Comptroller of the Currency Keith Noreika made clear that fintech companies can seek national bank charters under other authorities used to charter full-service banks, as well as other, long-established special-purpose national banks, such as trust banks, banker's banks, and Competitive Equality Banking Act (CEBA) credit card banks.  Outlook  Looking ahead to 2018, the OCC is considering developing a program for the OCC to participate in bank pilots to further the its understanding of innovative products, services, processes, or technologies.  A program such as this may accomplish the same goals as what others call ""sandboxes,"" and allow the OCC to foster responsible innovation by OCC-supervised banks and enable participants to obtain OCC feedback early in the development process.  Information gathered in the pilots could also inform OCC policies and ensure that we are ready to supervise the new activity when implemented on a larger scale. Pilots, however, do not provide a safe harbor from banks' compliance responsibilities.  Also in 2018, the OCC will expand its Office Hours program to other financial innovation hubs, build on its outreach and research efforts, and improve the awareness and knowledge of OCC staff on emerging trends in the industry.  The OCC will continue to identify ways to promote and support banks interested in engaging in responsible innovation by partnering with fintechs and other non-bank companies in a safe and sound manner, reducing costs and increasing earnings, and serving their customers more effectively.

42380298,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Mfvv,1516363253,Stuck at $12K: Bitcoin Price Needs Quick Progress to Avert Further Losses,"Stuck in the doldrums today, bitcoin needs a quick break above $12,500 or the tide may turn in favor of the bears, the charts suggest.  The ""V"" shaped recovery in bitcoin (BTC) from Wednesday's low has stalled below the $12,000 mark in the last 12 hours. Prices on CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) did rise to $12,045.09 at 15:14 UTC yesterday, before retreating to sub-$11,500 levels by 22:00 UTC.  The slide from the high of $12,045 was extended further to $10,988.79 in Asian hours today. However, bitcoin soon regained poise and rose to an intraday high of $11,808.49 (at 08:44 UTC).  As of writing, bitcoin is trading at $11,660. The world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has appreciated by 3.17 percent in the last 24 hours, according to data source OnChainFX. BTC is also up 27 percent from the week's low of $9,199.59 (as per the BPI).  However, the price chart analysis says the immediate outlook is neutral and only two consecutive daily closes (as per UTC) above $12,500 would improve odds of BTC rallying sharply in line with the historical pattern.  Daily chart  The above chart (prices as per Coinbase) shows:  Bearish exhaustion below the 100-day moving average (MA) (as indicated by long-tailed candles), coupled with a close above $11,004 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement) has neutralized the immediate bearish outlook.  Still, the previous day's doji candle shows indecision in the marketplace following the sharp recovery from the low of $9,005. Further, the 5-day and 10-day MAs carry a strong bearish bias (sloping downwards), while the 100-day MA is flatlined (neutral).  Hence, the bulls need progress soon – specifcally a quick move above $12,500 (Dec. 30 low) – or the bears may push BTC below the strong support level of $11,004 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement + 100-day MA).  4-hour chart  View  An intraday rally to $12,500 cannot be ruled out, but gains above that level are unlikely, courtesy of downward sloping MAs.  Only two consecutive closes (as per UTC) above $12,500 would confirm that a bottom is in place at $9,005 and open doors for $17,174 (Jan. 6 high).  Bearish scenario: Failure at $12,500 and a close (as per UTC) below $11,004 could yield a deeper sell-off to 200-day MA located at $7,269 today, and seen shifting higher to $7,500 over the next couple of days.

The group, the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), warned that, since cryptocurrencies can operate freely across borders, these ""highly speculative investments"" are attracting participation from retail investors based in different countries.  In the event of a potential scam or fraud, token sale projects may be out of the jurisdiction of the investor's country of residence. As such, the organization advises investors to be ""very careful"" before investing in ICOs.  The notice is just the latest case in which financial regulators from around the world have been actively monitoring the development of either individual token sales or ICO activity as a whole.  Over the last year, multiple countries had made notable moves on regulating ICOs. While China and South Korea formally banned such activities, other places like the U.S., the U.K. and recently Malaysia, are also increasing scrutiny over token issuances that may be defined as securities.  As detailed by IOSCO in its website, so far financial watchdogs from at least 26 countries have issued warnings on ICO risks.  Based in Madrid, Spain, IOSCO consists of top financial watchdogs from over 100 countries around the world.

Responding to two investment associations on Jan. 18, the public letter is written by Dalia Blass, director at SEC's Division of Investment Management. While the division has seen growing interests from proponents of mutual funds and ETFs that hold value in cryptocurrencies, the letter states that there are ""significant investor protection issues that need to be examined before sponsors begin offering these funds to retail investors.""  According to Blass, the agency's concerns mainly focus on five areas: valuation, liquidity, custody, arbitrage and potential manipulation. As the letter pointed out, for example, the SEC needs to evaluate how a cryptocurrency-related ETF can be fairly priced given the volatility of cryptocurrency prices, and amid technological changes such as blockchain forks.  In addition, liquidity remains another top issue that needs to be examined, in particular, how such innovative products can be redeemed by retail investors on a daily basis.  The letter states:  ""Until the questions identified above can be addressed satisfactorily, we do not believe that it is appropriate for fund sponsors to initiate registration of funds that intend to invest substantially in cryptocurrency and related products, and we have asked sponsors that have registration statements filed for such products to withdraw them.""  Blass' comments come following several recent filings with the SEC from firms seeking to list cryptocurrency-related ETFs. As reported by CoinDesk this month, some of these filings had been subsequently withdrawn, with the companies involved citing the regulator's concerns over valuation and liquidity.  Last year  , the SEC also rejected a request for a bitcoin-tied product proposed by noted bitcoin investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.

42428451,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL80jh,1516352403,Why São Paulo Wants to Pay for Infrastructure with Cryptocurrency,"The Brazilian state of São Paulo is looking to cryptocurrency to help solve its infrastructure problems.  The state, home to 45 million residents and the city of São Paulo – the largest metropolis in the southern hemisphere and the third-largest in the world – plans to use a token called buildcoin to pay engineers across the globe for feasibility studies. These studies are required to assess the practicality and justify the expense of large construction projects.  To test the concept, São Paulo will crowdsource and finance studies this way for the Ilumina SP program, which aims to swap out antiquated public lighting systems for newer and more efficient alternatives.  If successful, the blockchain solution could be a workaround for governments that want to invest in infrastructure, but lack either the money to pay for credible independent studies (which are needed to attract outside investors and get the ball rolling on projects) or access to the needed expertise.  São Paulo officials say a model that can attract more minds from around the world and compensate them with cryptocurrency can help the state meet its infrastructure requirements in a way that is more transparent, cheaper and faster than the existing process.  ""We like innovation in São Paulo, and blockchain and cryptocurrencies are being followed as extremely interesting innovations that we had to start experimenting with,"" Hélcio Tokeshi, secretary of treasury for the state of São Paulo, told CoinDesk.  How it works  The state is partnering on this initiative with CG/LA Infrastructure, a Washington, D.C., consultancy, and the BuildCoin Foundation, based in (where else?) Zug, Switzerland.  The pilot project will leverage CG/LA's global network of 60,000 infrastructure experts with the foundation's eponymous token, which is designed to create an alternative payments ecosystem for the construction industry.  First, study proposals would be submitted by governments to the BuildCoin Foundation for vetting. Selected projects would be green-lighted and floated to experts in CG/LA's database.  That's where the coin, an ERC-20 token that runs on top of the ethereum blockchain, comes in.  For example, an engineer in Finland who specializes in bridges could receive an invitation to collaborate on a feasibility study for a bridge commissioned by a local government in Brazil. He would receive remuneration in buildcoin based on his overall contribution to the project, measured with a Reddit-like system where other participants can vote up or down the quality of his work.  Why would the engineer accept payment in a specialized digital token rather than money he can spend at the local grocery? If all goes according to plan, the buildcoins would eventually be redeemable for other services in the same ecosystem, such as subcontracting from other participating firms, market research and professional training.  Similar to many token-based blockchain projects, the value proposition gets stronger the more participants join the network – provided the initial chicken-and-egg problem is overcome.  In this way, CG/LA and BuildCoin believe that a blockchain and a native cryptocurrency for the infrastructure and construction industry will not only ease burdens on governments, but also open up new opportunities for subject matter experts around the world who are eager to contribute to projects but have historically had difficulty finding studies or colleagues to match up with their particular skill sets.  “Collaboration is almost the Holy Grail of infrastructure,” said Norm Anderson, president and CEO of CG/LA. Yet before the idea came along of a token to incentivize members of the network, he said,  “There was no way to get them engaged at a high level on a consistent basis.”  While there is undoubtedly some uncertainty involved with such a novel approach, Tokeshi argued that for São Paulo, the potential benefits of an auditable public ledger, and a way to pay for studies without tapping taxpayers' funds, outweigh the risks:  ""It is an innovation and this in itself will require people to take some time to study and understand. On the other hand, we gain by increasing the potential sources of financing for the projects, gaining more visibility and transparency.""  Desperation breeds innovation  Faced with an economic crisis and tighter government purse strings in recent years, infrastructure spending in Brazil has shrunk to around 1 percent of gross domestic product – significantly lower than the 4 percent global average and insufficient to cover even basic maintenance requirements.  Traditionally, Brazilian empreiteiras – massive construction conglomerates – would perform both the feasibility studies and the construction work for a given project after winning the contract from the government.  But because of an ongoing corruption scandal, which has seen a number of construction tycoons jailed, these conglomerates have been largely removed from the picture.  This situation has left local governments in search of a new way to pay for the studies, which typically run between $500,000 and $1 million.  But it created a window of opportunity for buildcoin.  Were it not for the scandal, Anderson said,  ""We wouldn’t have a project because some empreiteira would be all over this thing promising some magic saying 'trust me, don't worry about it, just send the checks to this account in Panama.'""  A global problem  A former informal advisor to U.S. President Donald Trump on infrastructure issues, Anderson argues that the buildcoin model, if successful, could be deployed outside of Brazil to help solve the massive worldwide problem of infrastructure underinvestment.  Global infrastructure investment falls short of target by an estimated $1 trillion a year, and in the U.S., the American Society of Civil Engineers reckons that $3.6 trillion in spending is needed over the next five years just to maintain and upgrade existing infrastructure.  Further, the problem of financing the studies needed to kickstart these projects expands far beyond just Brazil.  Anderson estimates that there are 80,000 infrastructure projects proposed worldwide in a given year, but only $200 million in funding is available for feasibility studies – meaning only about 400 studies are conducted each year.  And because studies frequently don't translate into real projects, they typically cause a host of budgeting and political headaches for governments.  ""If I do a study, the project may not materialize for several years, so it's outside the political cycle. So why am I going to budget for something today that's not going to be done until far off in the future?"" said John Cronin, president of the BuildCoin Foundation.  Should the Ilumina SP partnership succeed, Anderson said that the next steps will be to expand into other important but uncontroversial types of infrastructure projects such as wastewater treatment and transportation, in Brazil and other markets.  ""We're injecting private sector velocity into the infrastructure creation process,"" he said, adding:  ""This isn't the panacea. It is a catalyst that is deeply needed as part of a new infrastructure project origination model.""

42428452,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL80lh,1516338674,Where'd You Get That Token? 7 Platforms Managing ICOs,"Initial coin offerings (ICOs) are evolving into an industry unto themselves.  As in any growing business, you can tell this is happening when new third-party providers crop up with ever-more specialized services.  In the ICO industry, that's the handful of platforms that have recently launched to support token issuers throughout the life of their sales – providing investor verification, receiving and managing money, securing funds and distributing the tokens (or simple agreements for future tokens, also called SAFTs) on issuers' behalf.  In this way, the issuers themselves can focus on building their products without worrying about all the little details of the actual sale.  The new vendors represent the first wave of ICO platforms in a market that will no doubt continue to evolve, with these providers increasingly specializing into niches.  Just as the very structure of ICOs themselves is an ongoing conversation – for instance, Blockstack prioritized broad reach with its token sale, skipping the private presale altogether, whereas the Sliver.TV ICO of ""theta"" only had a private sale, canceling its public sale after it hit its hard cap – these platforms for launching token sales are also emphasizing different aspects of the sale process.  And while potential ICO investors are wading through white papers and scrutinizing tech teams and advisers to vet token projects, which platforms an ICO launches on is yet another mechanism for understanding what a token project is all about. Several of these platforms provide vetting before partnering with a project for example, while others are more eager to host as many projects as they can.  Call it re-intermediation if you like, a reinvention of investment banking for the crypto age, or simply a new business model with no apples-to-apples precedent. Here's a look at some of the companies taking the busywork out of running an ICO.  CoinList  Launched last May as a collaboration between Protocol Labs and AngelList, a platform for connecting early-stage startups with investors, CoinList aims to be ""the gold standard"" platform for token offerings.  Late last year, CoinList parted with AngelList – whose founder, Naval Ravikant, is an influencer in the blockchain space – became a standalone company, and since then CEO Andy Bromberg has positioned it as a place only for the ""best of the best token sales.""  To do so, the company examines not only ICO project's technical work, but also the token economics underpinning the system.  So far, only three projects have issued tokens through its platform, but these have been among some of the most widely-anticipated sales in the industry: Protocol Lab's Filecoin SAFTs, Blockstack's ""stacks"" and mobile video streaming provider, YouNow's ""props.""  Yet, a great many other ICOs in the space have used another CoinList product – ComplyAPI, a white-label product which handles investor accreditation, know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering compliance for ICOs.  Republic  Another AngelList spin-off, Republic occupies a unique area of the industry.  Launched in July 2016 as a traditional equity crowdfunding platform after the Jobs Act provided ways for non-accredited investors to invest in private companies, Republic recently launched a crypto token platform, using their Token DPA (debt payable by asset) instrument, for the same purpose.  For example, in December, Republic offered YouNow's ""props"" and facilitated the purchase of $1.07 million worth of the token in YouNow's larger token sale.  While the company gives access to those enthusiasts that would otherwise be constrained from participating in certain token sales, the platform isn't suited to run a complete ICO (most of the fundraising an ICO does would have to be on another platform).  Still, in its infancy, the ""props"" sale is the only one Republic has facilitated so far, but Republic CEO Kendrick Nguyen told CoinDesk more are soon to come.  He continued:  ""We're highly selective and choose to work primarily with projects that already have significant traction and/or have noted advisors and investors supporting their vision.""  TokenSoft  Co-founded by BitGo alum Mason Borda, TokenSoft focuses on providing assurance to the entrepreneurs launching crypto tokens with a white-label product that runs on client project sites.  ""Our clients can rest assured that they are adhering to their counsel's guidance by partnering with us,"" Borda told CoinDesk.  The company launched in September and its platform is structured so that it can answer any question a client's legal team might have over the course of a token sale. For example, the platform allows token issuer's counsel to assess the language and approach to verification of terms and conditions.  On September 9, the platform facilitated its first token sale for quantified biology platform Doc.ai, followed by the $5.5 million raise for cooperative ownership fund, Swarm Fund. It has four projects running on the platform now.  Indiegogo  Indiegogo  is one of the oldest and best-known crowdfunding sites. Along with Republic, it's one of the few companies on this list with non-crypto origins.  The company recently announced they'd be opening up the platform to ICOs, and Indiegogo's previous success and its existing community of people could be attractive for token issuers.  According to Slava Rubin, an Indiegogo co-founder:  ""Token-based fundraising has enormous potential to disrupt the capital markets, but today's landscape lacks a voice of credibility to help separate quality from quantity.""  While these platforms could seem like easy targets for tweaking business models to accept crypto token sales, Indiegogo's chief rival, Kickstarter, made it clear that it would not be facilitating the sale of crypto tokens.  Indiegogo is also proceeding cautiously. The only token project it has so far facilitated is the ICO for the Fan Controlled Football League (FCFL) launched on December 12, which met its $5 million goal in ten days.  ICO Engine  Swiss company Eidoo, which launched a crypto wallet and exchange last year, announced in November that it would be facilitating ICOs through a platform called ICO Engine.  While the platform is still new – with the product's standalone website still not available – ethereum-based decentralized lending platform ETHLend finished its token sale on the platform already through the use of Eidoo's mobile application, and augmented reality startup Ubiatar has made a commitment to use the company's platform for its upcoming sale.  Eidoo's marketing of the platform emphasizes the amount of active crypto users it has for its wallet and exchange – the app recently hit 200,000 downloads, arguing that more users are more potential investors.  Eidoo also facilitates airdrops of tokens for teams that want to use crypto to promote a product or service. But it doesn't yet have KYC/AML compliance built into the platform, although it can integrate with existing solutions in this area.  BlockEx  According to BlockEx CEO Adam Leonard:  ""Our head of capital markets says all the time, 'If I won't sell it to my mom, it ain't going on the platform.""  BlockEx is a very new platform for ICO issuance, but is making a name for itself by offering token issuers consulting on their white paper and token economics should the team believe the project is working on a good fundamental idea.  The platform limits itself to working with issuers of utility tokens – those that give holders access to a particular service. And it insists on strong KYC, plus will require milestones before releasing funds if companies want to raise a lot of money.  One of the features Leonard emphasized is its book building software, which helps a token issuer gauge interest from investors and finds a price for their offering.  While BlockEx doesn't technically ""market"" the token sales happening on its platform, the company does offer opportunities by organizing events and road shows where issuers can pitch their token to investors in person.  The company is also running its own ICO for a token that will give investors on the platform early access to token presales.  Cointopia  Launched this week, Cointopia built a platform for connecting ICO issuers to a long pipeline of investors.  And with the support (both as advisers and investors) of co-founder of Block.one Brock Pierce, Evercoin founder Miko Matsumura and Stellar founder Jed McCaleb, the company is sure to grab some attention.  The first two tokens it will be offering is the Bee token, which will back a decentralized version of Airbnb, and Cointopia's own ICO token.  According to Charles Michael Yim, Cointopia's founder, the company's main differentiator is its post-ICO management solution.  ""Companies have pain points in managing the tokens and funds post ICO, communicating to token holders, monitoring performance and most importantly driving value to the token,"" Yim said.  In an effort to help with that, Cointopia would like to start its own exchange, so that tokens immediately have a secondary market to be traded on.  Speaking to the nascency of the industry overall, Gil Penchina, a Cointopia adviser and investor, said in a press release:  ""As with any new growth industry, the companies selling the ‘picks and shovels’ always win.""  Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Brock Pierce is with Blockchain Capital. An earlier version of this report inaccurately indicated that the sales were limited to accredited investors.  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has ownership stakes in BitGo, Blockstack and Protocol Labs.
