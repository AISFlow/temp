15531433,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=545322,1690932639,Lightspark CEO Outlines The Challenges Of Building On The Bitcoin Lightning Network,"The CEO of Lightspark, David Marcus, has come forward to share his experiences on building atop the Bitcoin Lightning Network. Marcus noted the challenges the Lightning Network held for builders, stating that it was incredibly difficult and complex to develop software around the protocol. The Bitcoin Lightning Network And The Challenges It Holds for Builders According to the Lightspark CEO, a firm involved in developing payment solutions on the Lightning Network, a layer-2 scaling platform for Bitcoin, the firm decided to build on the network because of the “unique qualities” Bitcoin provides as the underlying network. Related Reading: US Presidential Candidate Defends Bitcoin, Calls Out Environmental Critics He explained that Lightspark’s objective is to build a cheap, very open, and interoperable protocol for virtual money/payments, and the Lightning Network is designed to be similar to layer 2 ZK-rollup for Bitcoin. However, the former president of Paypal and co-creator of Diem noted that building on Lightning and Bitcoin is about five times more difficult than developing on other protocols. This is because the process to create software around the protocol is incredibly difficult and complex to do. Nevertheless, with these objectives in mind, the platform committed to building on the Bitcoin Lightning Network and to do “Whatever it takes to reach their full potential.” But despite having high hopes about the prospects of the network, Marcus’s recent disclosures on Twitter have shown that building on the network was no easy feat. BTC price trending at $28,879 | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com Moving Forward Despite Difficulties According to Marcus, part of the challenges is attributed to the rigidity of Bitcoin and the difficulties involved in altering its structure to contain new code in its base layers to meet the needs of specific solutions. He pointed out that Bitcoin’s layer 1 is particularly rigid and building a new opcode to mainlet was practically not possible. However, despite these challenges, Lightspark remains upbeat, and instead of completely abandoning the Lightning Network protocol for other less complex chains, the platform intends to develop a payment solution that would still be applicable “100 years from now.” The firm also intends to reorganize the process enabling crypto market users to connect to the Lightning Network. Although this will depend on their ability to put in place the necessary peer-to-peer payment channels. Related Reading: USDT Issuer Tether Reports A 30% Decline In Profit Apart from Lightspark’s CEO, other players in the sector have also recognized the intricacies and general challenges of building software around the Lightning Network. Popular CEO of Binance Changpeng Zhao has previously pointed out that integrating Lightning Network services on Binance was more complex because of the usage of on-demand invoices, which are different from pre-generated addresses. Additionally, Fitatjaf, a prominent Bitcoin developer and founder of the decentralized social protocol Nostr, has also offered criticism of the Lightning Network, terming it a pile of complex and ugly hacks.

15536648,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=545334,1690929050,"Michael Egorov’s $100 Million Position, A Risk To Curve Finance And DeFi?","Following the recent exploit of Curve Finance pools, there have been genuine concerns about the stability of the decentralized exchange and the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) ecosystem. A new report has emerged, raising questions about Curve founder Michael Egorov’s $100 million loan positions. These positions have garnered significant interest, as they are backed by about 47% of the entire CRV circulating supply. With the price of CRV dwindling, these debts appear to be at risk of liquidation, putting the Curve protocol, CRV investors, and the overall DeFi space on edge. Related Reading: Ethereum DeFi Coins Plunge As Curve Concerns Threaten Major Market Crash A Breakdown Of Michael Egorov’s $100 Million Loan On Tuesday, August 1, crypto research firm Delphi Digital released a series of tweets, detailing the loan positions being held by Michael Egorov. According to the report, the Curve Finance founder has around $100 million in loans across various lending protocols backed by 427.5 million CRV tokens. Egorov has a 63.2 million USDT loan backed by 305 million CRV tokens on Aave. Delphi Digital revealed that the position has a liquidation threshold of 55% and is eligible for liquidation at 0.3767 CRV/USDT. For context, the CRV currently trades at $0.608595, according to CoinGecko data. This means that a 38% price decline will cause a liquidation of Egorov’s position on the Aave protocol. Meanwhile, the Curve founder has 59 million CRV backing a loan of 15.8 million FRAX on Frax Finance. Although this debt is much lower than his Aave position, it poses a much more significant risk to CRV due to Fraxlend’s Time-Weighted Variable Interest Rate. Delphi Digital also noted that liquidation of the Frax loan position can occur regardless of CRV’s price. According to the research firm, the loan is currently at 100% utilization, which allows the interest rate to double every 12 hours. While the interest rate currently stands at 81.20%, Delphi Digital said that it can potentially increase to the maximum of about 10,000% APY in 3.5 days. This high-interest rate could result in the eventual liquidation of the debt. CRVUSDT trading at $0.598 | Source: daily CRVUSDT chart from TradingView How Has The Curve Finance Founder Responded? So far, Michael Egorov has tried to stabilize his positions and the utilization rate twice, repaying a total of 4 million FRAX on July 31st. However, the utilization rate remained at 100%, as users swiftly remove liquidity as soon as he makes the payment. To address this, the Curve founder deployed a new Curve pool on Tuesday, August 1. This pool consists of stablecoin crvUSD and Fraxlend’s CRV/FRAX LP token, seeded with 100,000 CRV rewards. This is to incentivize liquidity toward the lending market, decrease the utilization rates, and ultimately reduce the liquidation risks. According to Delphi Digital, this pool attracted $2 million in liquidity and lowered the utilization rate to 89% four hours after launch. Related Reading: Is It A Good Idea To Buy Curve Now?

In other news, U.S. stocks are sharply lower after another strong labor market data point and a Fitch downgrade of the country's credit rating.  Bitcoin (BTC) briefly dipped below $29,000 as cryptocurrency markets erased all overnight gains following a report on the Department of Justice (DOJ) mulling criminal charges against Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange.  Binance could face fraud charges by the DOJ, but prosecutors worry about potentially spurring a bank run on the exchange, similar to what led to FTX's collapse last November, according to a Wednesday report by the online publication Semafor. U.S. officials are weighing alternatives such as ""fines and deferred or non-prosecution agreements” to mitigate harm for consumers, the report said citing sources.  BTC plunged as low as $28,933 immediately after the news, CoinDesk Indices data showed, then pared some of the losses as investors digested the development. The token was changing hands at $29,117 at around 18:00 UTC.  Binance's BNB token also dropped 4% on the news, then recovered slightly. It was trading at around $240, still down 2% over the last 24 hours.  ""[The news] actually seems less bearish than the headline initially reads,"" Will Clemente, co-founder of market research firm Reflexivity Research, tweeted. ""Binance/DoJ announcement has been overhanging the market for months. Looks like we’re finally getting a resolution and it’s not as bad as expected,"" he added in a separate post.  See more: Get professional-grade crypto data and news at CoinDeskMarkets.com  BTC, crypto markets erase gains  Bitcoin (BTC) rallied as high as $30,032 during the night before reversing all overnight gains alongside a big slide in stocks and gains for U.S. Treasury yields following more indications of labor market strength.  The pullback erased all gains that occurred after bitcoin holder MicroStrategy announced plans to raise funds to boost its coin stash, and the rating agency Fitch downgraded its credit rating for the U.S. government, from AAA to AA+, citing repeated brinkmanship over the debt ceiling.  The CoinDesk Market Index, a measure of crypto markets performance, sit 0.09% lower on a 24-hour basis despite the overnight surge, showcasing the retracement.  The dollar index (DXY), which tracks the greenback's value against major fiat currencies, fell from 102.14 to 101.95 in a knee-jerk reaction to the ratings downgrade, only to bounce back to 102.64 at press time. The 10-year Treasury yield chalked out a similar drop and pop to hover above 4%. Bitcoin tends to move in the opposite direction of the greenback and bond yields.  Two of the so-called big three rating agencies have now placed the default rating at AA+. Moody's still has a top rating of AAA.  The S&P downgraded the U.S. to AA+ on Aug. 5, 2011, following which the dollar index and Treasury yields initially declined but quickly bounced back. Stocks tumbled, with bitcoin falling over 38% in the same month, data from TradingView show. The only major asset to rally alongside DXY was gold, which gained over 10%.  If history is a guide, the dollar index looks set to rise further, bringing more pain to bitcoin and stocks, although impending buying pressure from MicroStrategy might support the cryptocurrency's price.  Read More: Bitcoin Whale Michael Saylor Might Buy a Lot More BTC  As of writing, futures tied to the S&P 500, Wall Street's benchmark equity index pointed to a negative open with a 0.5% drop. As Asia began its business day, bitcoin jumped past $30,000 after software developer and bitcoin whale MicroStrategy submitted a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to sell up to $750 million in stock with the intent of using the capital to purchase more BTC.  Major U.S. equity indexes – Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 – fell 2.2% and 1.4%, on Wednesday.  In a note to CoinDesk, Mark Connors, the head of research at Canadian digital asset manager 3iQ, wrote that the recent ""shift in market sentiment was NOT limited to digital assets, as equities took a breather.""  ""Our bellwether cross asset correlation metric hit a 20Y high as bonds and equities sold off,"" Connors wrote. ""Looking forward, we will monitor for any sharp reversal from this historically high correlation - as that has often signaled a risk reversal.""  ETH, LTC, CRV track BTC lower  Ether (ETH), the native token of Ethereum, fell 0.5% from early Asian session highs to $1,832 taking cues from bitcoin's negative turnaround. Per one analyst, ETH is overvalued and could slide further. Options market is seeing price weakness over the next six months.  Litecoin (LTC) plunged 6% during the day as the token underwent its anticipated halving event. Similar to Bitcoin halvings, the event cuts the rewards for miners in half every four years, curbing the issuance of new tokens. During the prior two occasions, LTC price hit a peak before the halving date and slid lower for months. The token this time is down 22% from its yearly high recorded a month ago, CoinDesk Indices data shows.  Curve's CRV token pulled back 5% to 58 cents. The cryptocurrency rose more than 20% to over 62 cents on Tuesday, likely on the back of a short squeeze. The increase came after Sun purchased more than $2 million worth of the token and pledged additional assistance through a liquidity pool on the Tron network. Curve fell victim to an exploit late Sunday, triggering a sell-off in CRV that got the market worried about potential liquidation of Curve founder's large borrowed position.  ""Clearly, there are fears over a liquidation cascade happening within the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem, Richard Mico, the U.S. CEO of payment-and-compliance infrastructure provider Banxa, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. ""I don’t know how likely such a cascade is, but the market seems jittery as a result of these metastasizing issues. What’s ironic is that DeFi had held up so well during the blowups of 2022, and yet it’s an exploit more recently that might be the trigger for a DeFi blowup itself now.""  Mico added that a judge's ruling against stablecoin issuer Terraform Labs' motion to dismiss a lawsuit against the SEC might ""be adding to the relatively soft sentiment in the market,"" but he noted that investors were buying up bitcoin's recent ""dips below $29,000...pretty quickly,"" a sign that buyers are accumulating in expectation of the SEC approving one of the recent spot BTC ETF applications.

42392800,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgC409,1690927171,This Art Exhibit Is Bringing New Life to Allen Ginsberg’s Poetry Using AI,"The estate of acclaimed American poet and countercultural icon Allen Ginsberg is bringing new life to his art by using artificial intelligence (AI) to create new works based on his expansive literary archive.  Ginsberg, best known for his 1955 poem “Howl,” which celebrates the subversion of societal norms, died in 1997. His evocative work is widely credited for inspiring the literary subculture movement known as the Beat Generation.  Beginning on Aug. 10, the Fahey/Klein Gallery in Los Angeles will unveil a new exhibition titled “Muses & Self: Photographs by Allen Ginsberg,” featuring photographs from Ginsberg’s collection. In addition, the gallery will host a preview of “A Picture of My Mind: Poems Written by Allen Ginsberg’s Photographs,” a collection of poems generated by an AI trained using Ginsberg’s literary body of work.  Read more: How Artists Can Create AI Data Sets  The exhibition runs through September and was developed in collaboration with non-fungible token (NFT) poetry gallery and digital community TheVERSEverse with support from the Tezos Foundation. The collection utilizes an AI-powered camera that turns visual imagery into text.  “In celebration of Ginsberg’s avowedly experimental impulses, this collaboration utilizes an AI-powered camera to ‘read’ a selection of Ginsberg photographs on view during the exhibition, translating his iconic vision of American counterculture into poetic responses influenced simultaneously by Ginsberg’s canon, his undeniable presence woven inextricably into the written record of the internet, and parsed by AI,” the gallery writes in its description of the exhibition.  “Just as Ginsberg innovated with automated writing techniques and popular technologies, this collection of AI-generated poems taps the contemporary linguistic avant-garde to engage ritualistically, intuitively and meaningfully with Ginsberg’s visual and poetic vernacular,” it adds.  The development of AI has accelerated in recent months following the mainstream proliferation of popular tools like Midjourney and ChatGPT. AI tools have been created to help artists across genres and disciplines, from music to art to text-based designs. AI tools have also been used to replicate the styles of particular artists, both living and post-mortem, though there have been allegations of misappropriation of these tools to steal artists’ work without credit.",POSITIVE,없음,OTHER,Rosie Perper,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/08/01/this-art-exhibit-is-bringing-new-life-to-allen-ginsbergs-poetry-using-ai,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/df67ac9f396f5f83c77c54de0a6120d2f090871e-2560x1440.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42392826,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgCGzP,1690925509,"Litecoin ‘Halving,’ Set for Wednesday, Should Harden Supply of ‘Digital Silver’","Blockchain's third halving in its 12-year history is expected Wednesday and reduces the current 12.5 litecoin (LTC) subsidy to 6.25 LTC.  Litecoin founder Charlie Lee says these disinflationary halvings help achieve mass adoption without sacrificing network security.  Litecoin creator Charlie Lee knew Bitcoin was special after he read an article in 2011 about how it was the exclusive payment method on Silk Road, a marketplace for illicit drugs; a feat no traditional payment method could accomplish at the time.  He was so impressed that when he later decided to start his own project, he cloned Bitcoin inventor Satoshi Nakamoto’s code – including many of the original blockchain’s key features. One of those was the implementation of periodic “halvings” into the blockchain’s underlying programming, for a 50% reduction in the pace of new issuance of the cryptocurrency every four years or so.  That quadrennial milestone is expected to happen Wednesday around 15:09 UTC (11:09 am ET), according to the website litecoinblockhalf.com. It will be the Litecoin blockchain’s third halving since its inception in 2011.  Lee explained during a Twitter livestream last week that these disinflationary halvings help achieve mass adoption without sacrificing network security.  Litecoin, like Bitcoin, uses a “proof-of-work” security mechanism – relying on “miners” who expend computational resources to process transactions and secure the network. During that process, miners win rewards – a combination of variable transaction fees and a predetermined “subsidy” that gets halved approximately every four years. (With Litecoin, they happen every 840,000 transaction blocks, and the average time to generate each block is about 2.5 minutes.)  Eventually, the plan is to wean the miners off these subsidies and pay them mostly via transaction fees.  “Satoshi chose four-year block halving so that it gives enough time for the network to grow in time for the fees to eventually take over.” Lee said. “The idea is that there will be enough usage on-chain creating enough fees. The fees will be enough to pay the miners to continue to help secure the network.”  But for now, the trick is to keep miners incentivized while gradually reducing the payouts. Lee says one possibility is that since there are fewer new units of the cryptocurrency being created, the price should ostensibly get a boost thanks to a slower increase in the supply.  “The price is driven by supply and demand,” Lee explained during a Twitter Spaces event on Tuesday. “If the supply side gets cut in half and the demand stays the same, then the price should go up.”  Read more: As Litecoin Halving Approaches, Founder Touts Silver Collector Cards Loaded With 'Digital Silver'  Bitcoin, started in 2009, is the largest cryptocurrency by far, and is often viewed by crypto analysts as a bellwether of digital-asset markets. And crypto traders, who have uncannily tracked the Bitcoin blockchain’s own quadrennial halvings, are well aware of the patterns observed in bitcoin’s price. Bull markets typically start one year before Bitcoin’s having, and culminate in extreme sell-offs two years afterward.  That’s also the current trajectory, ahead of Bitcoin’s next halving, expected in 2024. The BTC price is up 77% year-to-date, following last year’s 64% sell-off.  The litecoin (LTC) price is up 33% in 2023, and crypto analysts aren’t predicting any massive uptick in connection with this week’s halving.  “Like I’ve previously said, a lot of the price action is a self-fulfilling prophecy,” Lee said. “Just because people think the halving is going to cause the price to go up, they will buy ahead of the halving or even right after the halving.”  “For bitcoin and litecoin, sometimes the price went up before, sometimes it runs up afterwards,” Lee added. “Sometimes it doesn't really have too much of an effect. It all depends on how the market reacts to the halving.”  As much as anything, Litecoin’s halving might just provide a lesson on blockchain mechanics as Bitcoin’s next halving approaches.",POSITIVE,BTC | LTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | LTC | MARKET | TRADING,Frederick Munawa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/08/01/litecoin-halving-set-for-wednesday-should-harden-supplies-of-digital-silver,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e1573c969de5fe0d6cb5731a9bd0b1df112869bb-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This means the platform will offer more tokens than its local competitors in Japan, with major domestic exchanges Bitbank, GMO Coin, and Coincheck listing 30, 36, and 22 tokens, respectively. The largest crypto exchange by trading volume intends to list its native BNB token, making this the first time it will be available in the country. Some of the other tokens expected to be listed include Axie Infinity (AXS), Solana (SOL), and Avalanche (AVAX). A Remarkable Re-entry News of the re-entry into Japan was announced by the CEO of Binance via a Twitter video. According to him, the platform has been making efforts to re-enter the Japanese market for a while now. He was effusive with his praises and noted that since 2017, Japan had established crypto exchange regulations, including the recent stablecoin regulations enacted in June. He also stated it was “fantastic to see Japan being a leader in the Web3 regulatory environment.” Related Reading: USDT Issuer Tether Reports A 30% Decline In Profit He further added that Binance was glad to once again partake in the Japanese market after its purchase of the Sakura Exchange BitCoin (SEBC) platform in November last year. Following the acquisition, SEBC changed its name to Binance Japan Inc. The purchase of the exchange was instrumental in paving the way for the re-entrance of Binance in Japan. Binance will initially offer sport trading services. However, the exchange will not render leveraged trading services since this will require a Type 1 Financial Instruments Business license, with more restrictive standards. Additionally, cryptocurrency users in Japan will also be offered access to Binance Earn, a specially designed program that enables participants to earn interest on their cryptocurrency deposits. The exchange will also render Japanese crypto traders an opportunity to trade on its NFT marketplace.

The native token of Ripple Labs, XRP was just behind, adding 46.6% during the month as a U.S. judge ruled the sale of XRP tokens on exchanges as not constituting as investment contracts.  The two leading cryptocurrencies by market cap, bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) each lost 4% last month.  Much of MKR’s surge to a near a one-year high price came on July 21 following the introduction of a token buyback program.  Ripple at one point during the month had nearly doubled, climbing to as high as 93.8 cents on July 13 immediately after the District Court for the Southern District of New York said the sale of XRP on digital asset exchanges did not amount to investment contracts. XRP has since pulled back to the $0.70 level, but still sported a big gain for July.  Also witnessing noticeable gains across July was Stellar’s XLM token, which climbed 35%. The Stellar Foundation issued a research report detailing its off-ramps last week, which one analyst cited as the reason for the token’s daily sudden move where it jumped 12% in 24 hours. Christopher Newhouse, an independent crypto derivatives trader, noted that traders saw the report as an opportunity for a more fundamental based move to continue on the back of the narrative that XLM is one of the most well-connected and integrated USDC cash off-ramps.  Other gainers in July included Solana’s SOL which was up 25%, likely in concert with the big move higher for Ripple.  The assets faring worst last month included bitcoin cash (BCH), which lost 20%, and litecoin (LTC), which dropped 18%. Litecoin's decline came ahead of the token's third halving event – a programmed 50% reduction in the pace of new issuance of the cryptocurrency – which is expected to take place tomorrow.  Looking forward, August tends to be a slow month for markets. FundStrat said in a note to investors that although the final month of the summer tends to be a time for market depth to weaken, the fact that so many cite August as a seasonal risk, “actually makes us think this is less likely to be the case.”  One positive upcoming catalyst might be an SEC decision on any of the numerous spot bitcoin ETF applications. The market is optimistic this will eventually get done,” said LMAX Digital in a morning note. “An approval of an ETF of a well-established and well-respected name like BlackRock could really open the door to a huge wave of demand, ushering in the next major push for institutional adoption.”  In 2022, bitcoin tumbled 14% in August and ether dipped 8%.

15533407,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=545286,1690921853,"Bitcoin Drops Under $29,000, Here’s Where BTC Could Find Support Next","Bitcoin has plunged below the $29,000 level during the past day. According to on-chain data, here’s the next level that could act as major support. Bitcoin Short-Term Holder Realized Price May Be The Next Support Level As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the realized price of the short-term holders at $28,000 could be an essential level for the asset. The “realized price” here refers to the cost basis (that is, the buying price) of the average investor in the Bitcoin market. Whenever the price of the asset dips below this level, it means that more than 50% of the investors are now underwater. Similarly, a break above the point implies that the overall market has entered into a state of profits. In the context of the current discussion, the realized price of the entire market isn’t of relevance, but rather of a specific segment of it: the “short-term holders” (STHs). This investor group typically only includes holders who bought their BTC within the last six months. Here is a chart that shows the trend in the average cost basis for this Bitcoin cohort over the history of the cryptocurrency: How the realized price of the STHs has shifted throughout history | Source: CryptoQuant Historically, the Bitcoin STH realized price has had some interesting interactions with the spot price of the asset. First is the interactions during bullish periods, which the quant has highlighted in the above graph. It would appear that during these rallies, the price has usually remained above the level. But not just that, the STH realized price has actually actively provided support to it in such periods. In the rally during the past year, too, a similar trend has been seen, as both during the March and June price drawdowns, the cryptocurrency rebounded when it made a retest of this line. Related Reading: Is Another Bitcoin Rally Coming Soon? This Pattern May Say So Psychologically, investors view their cost basis as a profitable buying opportunity during bullish periods, as they believe that the price will only go up from here. So, whenever the asset returns to its cost basis in such periods, they are likely to accumulate again. This extraordinary buying pressure at the level of the STHs could perhaps explain why Bitcoin finds support here. In a similar way, the level acts as resistance during bearish periods, as investors start looking at their acquisition price as the ideal exit opportunity. From the chart, it’s visible that the Bitcoin spot price is approaching the STH realized price once again right now. This level, which is valued at $28,000 currently, could possibly be where Bitcoin can turn around its recent trend of decline.

42392824,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgCGp9,1690920975,MicroStrategy Takes $24M Q2 Charge on Multibillion-Dollar Bitcoin Haul,"MicroStrategy (MSTR) posted an impairment charge of $24.1 million on its bitcoin (BTC) holdings in the second quarter, compared to $917.8 million in the year-ago quarter and an $18.9 million charge in Q1, according to its latest earnings report.  The company's digital asset impairment reflects the decline in the price of bitcoin versus the price at which the bitcoin was acquired. Under current accounting rules, the value of digital assets such as cryptocurrencies must be recorded at their cost and then only adjusted if their value is impaired, or goes down. But if the price rises, that does not get reported unless an asset is sold.  The price of bitcoin began the second quarter at roughly $28,500 and ended the quarter at about $30,400.  ""Our bitcoin holdings increased to 152,800 bitcoins as of July 31, 2023, with the addition in the second quarter of 12,333 bitcoins being the largest increase in a single quarter since Q2 2021,"" said Andrew Kang, Chief Financial Officer, in a statement. ""We efficiently raised capital through our at-the-market equity program and used cash from operations to continue to increase bitcoins on our balance sheet. And we did so against the promising backdrop of increasing institutional interest, progress on accounting transparency, and ongoing regulatory clarity for bitcoin.”  The company acquired 12,333 bitcoin for $347 million in cash between April 29 and June 27, and another 467 BTC for $14.4 million in July, according to a tweet from executive chairman Michael Saylor.  Bitcoin prices have increased roughly 76% this year, while MicroStrategy shares have more than tripled. Its 152,800 bitcoins are worth roughly $4.5 billion.  Overall, MSTR reported revenue of $120.4 million, short of analyst estimates of revenue of $123.1 million.  Shares of MSTR were falling 1% to $430 after-hours on Tuesday.

42392830,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgCHJv,1690918540,Why MiCA Is Overly Burdensome Regulation for Ukraine's Crypto Industry,"Nine years ago, during the Revolution of Dignity, Ukraine chose its future within the European Union. From that very moment, Ukraine hasn't stopped fighting for its choice. Russia’s full-scale war against Ukraine is the main reason for the invasion is Ukraine's pro-European movement and its desire to distance itself from the eastern neighbor.  On June 23, 2022, the leaders of the 27 EU member countries made a historic decision to grant Ukraine the status of a candidate for membership in the European Union, the first step towards сountry’s joining the European family. Candidate status means that Ukraine is firmly moving towards full-fledged EU membership.  Oleksandr Bornykov is Deputy Minister of Digital Transformation of Ukraine on IT industry development and head of the Diia City project.  The integration process involves adapting national legislation to the pan-European standards. In aligning with the EU, the National Commission on Securities and Stock Market decided to adopt the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) into the national legal framework. The implementation of MiCA marks a significant step towards creating a harmonized framework for the regulation of crypto assets and related services within all 27 EU member states. The European Union is expected to become the first major jurisdiction in the world to establish a comprehensive regulation around crypto assets.  Implementing MiCA  For the EU crypto industry, MiCA indeed may represent a true game-changer. Today, crypto companies have to comply with 27 different regulatory frameworks in EU member states if they want to serve the single EU market. Under MiCA, pan-European regulations will enable crypto-service providers authorized by a competent authority in one EU member state to operate across the entire EU market under the ""passport"" regime.  However, with implementing all MiCA provision into its national legislation, Ukraine won’t be able to provide the same “passporting rights” to crypto companies because the country is not a full-fledged EU member. Therefore, the absence of ""passporting rights"" with implementation of stringent regulatory requirements will significantly limit the attractiveness of Ukraine’s jurisdiction.  The MiCA rules enforce multiple excessive disclosure requirements and liabilities on crypto platforms and token issuers, covering authorization, supervision of transactions, capital requirements, professional qualifications of management, content of whitepapers and marketing communications, among others, lots of requirements mainly borrowed from approaches common in traditional securities market regulation.  Read more: Dea Markova - Is Europe’s MiCA a Template for Global Crypto Regulation?  Moreover, issuers of new tokens must abide by new regulations. These requirements might be feasible for mature crypto players who have been operating in the EU market for a while, possess substantial capitalization, and can easily cover the legal substantive and compliance costs to align with the new regulation.  Despite Ukraine being the birthplace of numerous crypto startups, such as Bitfury, Hacken, Everstake, Matter Labs, GlobalLedger, and Crystal Blockchain, none of them are registered in Ukraine. The reason is simple: crypto companies cannot legally obtain authorization in the country, even if they desired to do so, because there is still no workable legal framework.  Stricter regulations threaten competition  Stringent regulatory rules will limit competition in the Ukrainian crypto market. Only a minority of crypto players will be able to handle overly burdensome requirements and liabilities. This type of market is often referred to as a ""provider-driven market,"" in contrast to more competitive ""user-driven markets.” To some extent, this dynamic becomes evident in the example of the traditional financial market, where banks, in the absence of competition, often impose unfavorable, and sometimes clearly exploitative, terms of service on retail customers.  Excessive compliance measures may create barriers for new CASPs. MiCA requires the drafting of a formal whitepaper that explains many details of a token project before it can be issued or listed on a crypto exchange. Such a requirement will add significant costs to the issuing process and greatly increase the risk of a company being taken to court. According to an impact assessment conducted by the European Commission in 2020, a whitepaper could cost between €35,000-€75,000 ($38,000-82,000), and further compliance costs could range from €2.8-16.5 million, potentially creating too high of an entry barrier for new crypto asset service providers (CASPs).  Crypto exchanges will undoubtedly try to shift those excessive compliance costs onto consumers by raising the cost of using their services. As a result, consumers will feel the price of excessive regulation from their pockets. In a time of war, such an outcome is certainly not what Ukrainian crypto users are seeking.  Read more: Europe ‘Ahead of the Game’ in Web3 After MiCA Law, U.S. House Finance Chair Says  Legal vacuum for crypto assets out of the scope of MiCA. The MiCA Regulation will not apply to crypto assets which are classified under the already existing legal framework, including financial instruments, funds and means that are not e-money tokens, deposits, including structured deposits, miscellaneous insurance and pension products, and securitization transactions. In Ukraine, we proposed a similar approach, but currently we have no necessary amendments to the national legislation regarding traditional financial markets. As a result, issuers of such crypto assets will be unable to obtain authorization in Ukraine.  Furthermore, the provisions of MiCA Regulation will not apply to NFTs. Therefore, by adopting these rules, the process of tokenizing of unique real-world assets, will become a lot more challenging in Ukraine.  Ukraine can shape its own policy  Whether MiCA will be able to encourage further growth of the European crypto industry will only be understood over time, once we observe how these new standards are implemented. Otherwise, Ukraine may end up in a situation where we have European crypto legislation without a regulated mature crypto market itself.  Instead of retaining our crypto talents at home, crypto startups with Ukrainian roots will prefer to obtain authorization and incorporate their business in European jurisdictions with ""passporting rights.” As time passes, we will not be able to ensure the de-shadowing of the crypto-based economy, some of whose dubious quality services Ukrainian users continue to utilize.  I firmly believe Ukraine would be wise to adopt only the most technically feasible provisions of the MiCA Regulation. In this way, we could avoid overly excessive regulation for our emerging crypto market, allowing companies to develop their business and gradually adapt to the new regulatory rules. After all, the European Parliament does not force Ukraine to move faster than necessary.  Our national ""homework"" is not just about ""copy-pasting"" European legislation, but creating a competitive jurisdiction for a new sector of the digital economy that will contribute to the postwar recovery of our country. When Ukraine becomes a full-fledged EU member, we will not be obliged only to align our national legislation with pan-EU standards, but the government will also be empowered with voting rights to shape European crypto policy by sharing our best practices on crypto regulation. We have to think strategically and utilize our time wisely if we want to make Ukraine a top destination for crypto business.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Oleksandr Bornykov,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/08/01/why-mica-is-overly-burdensome-regulation-for-ukraines-crypto-industry,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2ac66d283c78854532503d5fdf94beddb9ce5963-4032x2691.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The report highlights the continuation of the downtrend for Bitcoin, which has been losing its key support, the 50-day Moving Average (MA). The bearish trend has been confirmed by technical indicators and the pure fundamental Bitcoin Macro Index algorithm, which has seen an increasing rate of contraction over the last week. Is Bitcoin Headed For $25,000? The report provides insights into both high and low timeframe technicals, with the next support levels for Bitcoin at $28,000, $24,000, and low-$20,000, each offering better relative opportunities. The low timeframe technicals indicate a breakdown in support at $30,000 and the emergence of a new bearish trend, with a target of circa $25,000. The Capriole Bitcoin Macro Index, which combines over 40 of the most powerful Bitcoin on-chain, macro market, and equities metrics into a single machine learning model, suggests a decent long-term value for multi-year horizon investors, but with decreasing fundamentals over the last week. Related Reading: Litecoin Sharks Buy More Than 200,000 LTC Ahead Of Wednesday’s Halving On the other hand, the Three Factor Model, a new open-source algorithm, values the S&P500 using three fundamental data points only, indicating that the markets are fairly valued today, with room for more upside, despite recent bearish signals. Despite the bearish outlook, the report suggests that the macroeconomic backdrop remains favorable for Bitcoin over the coming years. The Federal Reserve has paused rate hikes, and the S&P500 has had its longest winning streak in years. However, the technicals and fundamentals are currently showing a “not yet” signal, indicating that the market may need to wait for a positive trigger such as the approval of the Blackrock ETF. Overall, the report suggests a long-term bullish outlook for Bitcoin, but with caution in the short term until technicals or fundamentals prove otherwise. According to Edwards, the nearest points of technical opportunity are $28,000, $25,000, and $21,000, or a daily close back into the $30,000 range. Low Volatility, High Potential Bitcoin’s price volatility has been at historic lows, with the cryptocurrency experiencing its second-lowest level of yearly volatility ever. This fact has been noted by many in the crypto community, including Crypto Con, who points out that historically, low volatility has been a bullish sign for Bitcoin. Low volatility can be seen as a sign of stability and maturity for a cryptocurrency. It suggests that the market is becoming more efficient and that there is less speculation driving prices up and down. This can be a positive sign for long-term investors, as it suggests that cryptocurrency is becoming more reliable as a store of value. Related Reading: Ethereum DeFi Coins Plunge As Curve Concerns Threaten Major Market Crash Moreover, Bitcoin has historically performed well after periods of low volatility. Every time Bitcoin’s volatility has dropped to similar levels in the past, it has been followed by a significant price increase. This suggests that, while the current low volatility may be frustrating for traders looking for quick profits, it could be a positive sign for long-term investors. In conclusion, while the current low volatility in Bitcoin’s price may not be exciting for traders, it could be a positive sign for long-term investors. Historically, low volatility has been a bullish sign for Bitcoin, and the cryptocurrency’s current stability comes at a time when several positive macroeconomic factors could drive its price up in the future. As of the time of writing, Bitcoin has lost its crucial support line of $29,000 and is currently trading at $28,900, representing a decline of over 1% in the last 24 hours.

15531767,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=545365,1690917906,"Bitcoin Bollinger Bands Are The Tightest Ever, What Happens Next?","Last week, the 1W Bollinger Bands in Bitcoin reached its tightest level ever. The volatility measuring tool typically doesn’t give any indication of direction, however. Using historical data, we’ve taken all previous instances of extreme lows and the resulting direction — up and down — and discovered the success rate of the signal. Bollinger Band Width Reaches Historical Lows: What Does It Mean? The Bollinger Bands are a complete trading system, designed by John Bollinger in the 1980s — an avid Bitcoin speculator. The tool uses a 20-period simple moving average (SMA) and two bands set at two standard deviations of the SMA. As such, the “Bands” expand and contract based on volatility — a measure of how aggressively price moves within a time period. When the Bands tighten to extremes, it indicates a period of low volatility. This setup is called a Squeeze, which ultimately releases pent up energy and results in a large move. When price action picks up, the bands expand to represent the return of volatility. According to Bollinger Band Width, a related tool designed to tell analysts how tight the bands on an easier to visually compare basis, the Bollinger Bands in BTCUSD are the tightest in the history of crypto. Notably, Ethereum and the TOTAL crypto market cap are also historically tight. The technical indicator, however, doesn’t say anything about direction, only that something big is on the way. In the past, Bitcoin has broken out in either direction. But how many of these times were up? And how far did it climb? When will explosive volatility return? | BTCUSD on TradingView.com Bitcoin Breakout Performance Analyzed: Average 669% ROI When Volatility Returns Past performance is never a guarantee of future results, but from historical price data we can better understand the behavior in BTCUSD after such low volatility phases. Of the nine total instances the Bitcoin weekly Bollinger Bands got this tight, the top cryptocurrency by market cap rallied upward after upon breakout seven times. The average upward movement across all seven times is 872%. In contrast, the two down moves resulted in an average crash of 40%.< Bitcoin falling 40% from here would take it back to $17,500 per coin, while a 872% move higher would take BTCUSD to over $280,000 per coin. The average of up and down moves resulted in a grand total of 669%, which would take the number one cryptocurrency to over $220,000. Considering the rule of diminishing returns, such a strong move is unlikely. However, the data speaks to the magnitude of the move that could occur, once volatility returns.

The move comes after regulators and lawmakers in the U.S. have doubled down on its efforts to crack down on crypto-related companies in recent months, including Coinbase and Binance, which both were sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

As a result of intensifying regulations in the U.S., multiple companies have moved overseas to focus on their business there until there’s more regulatory clarity in the region.

Inscriptions on Bitcoin’s mainnet were first introduced by programmer Casey Rodarmor in January and paved the way for Ordinals NFTs. Previously, the Ordinals team was funded privately by Rodarmor himself, as well as through gifted contributions to the core developers.  On Tuesday, the team announced the creation of the Open Ordinals Institute, a registered 501(c)(3) that will collect donations in Bitcoin to initially help bolster the work of its core developers – including pseudonymous developer Raph, the recently-appointed lead Ordinals Protocol maintainer. After recently launching the Ordinals.org site to share progress on protocol development, the site will now accept donations to the institute through two bitcoin wallet addresses.  Ordinals core developer, Ordinally, shared in a press release that launching a non-profit was the “cleanest way” to compensate developers without compromising the values and goals of the protocol.  Erin Redwin, Open Ordinals Institute board member, told CoinDesk that the non-profit hopes to empower developers to help grow the newly-discovered utility of Bitcoin-based NFTs.  “Companies across Web3 ecosystems – including Ethereum, Solana, Stacks, and others – are quickly building Ordinals infrastructure after previously believing NFT-functionality ‘wasn't possible’ on native Bitcoin,” said Redwin. “Given Ordinals' unprecedented pace of adoption and real-world implications for various crypto-economies, we believe it is crucial to fund a strong team of non-corporate funded developers to ensure the security and neutrality of this open-source protocol.”  The Ordinals protocol has quickly garnered the attention of Bitcoin maximalists and NFT collectors alike for its versatility, as well as its potential to pump the value of bitcoin itself. In May, Ordinals reached 3 million inscriptions, and weeks later, helped Bitcoin come in second as the network with the highest NFT trading volume.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | SOL | SPONSORED,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/08/01/the-ordinals-team-is-creating-a-non-profit-to-support-bitcoin-nft-developers,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e44d46bf40156de0a7febe6e36d2d65f1edf7954-1566x894.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42392817,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgCGFF,1690916392,Bitcoin Has Been More Stable Than Gold and Stocks; Violent Price Action Could Ensue,"Bitcoin’s five-day volatility has dropped below that of of gold, the Nasdaq 100 and the S&P 500, crypto analytics firm K33 Research noted.  These periods in the past led to “violent” breakouts and “dramatic eruption” in volatility, said K33.  Bitcoin’s (BTC) price may be sleep-inducing of late, but it's become so boring that a dramatic eruption could soon be coming.  According to digital asset analytics firm K33 Research, bitcoin's five-day volatility has sunk below that of gold, the Nasdaq 100 and the S&P 500. This only happened a few times in recent years, K33 senior analyst Vetle Lunde pointed out, and every occasion preceded periods of wild price swings.  With the exception of a brief, Ripple-related, mid-July move up to $31,800, bitcoin has traded in an increasingly tighter range for the past six weeks, its price mostly sticking between $29,000-$30,000, and then for the past few days rarely moving out of the $29,000-$29,500 area. At press time, it was changing hands at $29,100.  While, cryptocurrencies are popularly known for their dramatic changes in price, steadier periods are normal parts of every market cycle. However, this recent period of absent volatility is far from typical, the K33 report pointed out.  BTC’s 30-day volatility, which measures average price changes over the period, recently dropped to near a five-year low. At the same time, trading volumes also shrunk to multi-year lows, while derivatives activity has also declined sharply.  BTC price volatility nears  “A deep crypto sleep tends to be followed by a violent wake-up,” Vetle Lunde wrote. “The market is clearly in an unprecedented stable stage, which has typically acted as a massive pressure valve for volatility once it finally reignites.”  “My short-term thesis,"" he continued, ""is that the market’s volatility pressure is about to climax and that an eruption is near.""  Upcoming decisions on spot BTC ETFs and a court ruling in the lawsuit between GBTC fund issuer Grayscale and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could be potential catalysts over the next two months, Lunde explained. Grayscale is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, CoinDesk’s parent company.  Read more: Will 2023 Be the Year of the Bitcoin ETF?  However, he added, structural forces in the derivatives market could also induce volatility on their own without any news events as happened June 2020 or January of this year. During these squeezes higher, said Lunde, most traders positioned for further price drops by building short positions. Prices moving in the opposite direction forced traders to cover their positions adding fuel to the appreciation.  “Gradual but aggressive BTC accumulation is my preferred strategy at the time being,” Lunde advised, adding that the trend allows some contrarian strategies such as “buying farther dated out of the money call and put options to be rigged for a changing volatility climate in the future.”",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/08/01/bitcoin-has-been-more-stable-than-gold-and-stocks-violent-price-action-could-ensue,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c13b37554391ce1561a7ec9eec963f3a95b52c4c-1422x800.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42392832,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgCHUB,1690916319,Is the Computing Sector Surfing the AI Surge?,"The crypto market has seen a volatile yet cautiously encouraging year, with the CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) up 63% so far in 2023. However, in this particular market, a significant amount of this gain can be attributed to Bitcoin, which is up 76% year-to-date. Only 10% of the CMI constituents have outperformed Bitcoin during this period.  One side effect of Bitcoin’s marked increase in value is that it can overshadow other noteworthy trends, such as the standout performance of several computing-related assets. The CoinDesk Computing Index (CPU), the benchmark index for the computing sector, includes computing protocols as defined by CoinDesk’s Digital Asset Classification Standard (DACS). DACS seeks to classify the top 500 digital assets by market capitalization into seven sectors: Currency, Smart Contract Platforms, Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Culture & Entertainment, Computing, Digitization, and Stablecoin.  So far in 2023, we have seen several assets within the CPU index outperform amid the recent focus on Artificial Intelligence and distributed computing. As shown below, we’ve broken down the percentage of assets that have increased in value across all six CMI sector benchmark indices (the Stablecoin sector is not included in CMI).  Computing stands out against the other sectors due to the number of the index’s members that have not only outperformed but also beaten BTC’s impressive gain. In other words, this chart illustrates that an investment in a random member of the CPU index at the beginning of 2023 would have had a 70% chance of experiencing a gain and a 1 in 5 chance of outperforming Bitcoin’s 76% year-to-date return.  CPU contains projects that aim to decentralize the sharing, storing, and transmission of data. Some of the leading assets within the index this year include Render Token (RNDR), a distributed GPU rendering network, up more than 300%; Fetch.Ai (FET), a decentralized machine learning network, up 137%; data marketplace Ocean Protocol (OCEAN), up 127%; and The Graph (GRT), a data indexing protocol, up 111%. All four protocols relate to big data and increasing computational power, two necessities for large language models, which require vast computational resources ​​to learn complicated patterns.  The outperformance of these specific assets comes at a time of skyrocketing public interest in large language models, which heavily depend on computing power and data. This correlation becomes evident when we compare CPU with Google Trends for ""Chat GPT,"" one of the most widely used applications of large language models. As interest in the Google search term surged early in the year, so did CPU returns, with the index peaking in February 2023, just before interest in “Chat GPT"" peaked in March. As interest began to wane later in the year, so did CPU’s performance. The emphasis on enhancing computational resources among protocols represented in CPU, such as Render and Ocean, suggests a fundamental link between CPU performance and sentiment surrounding AI technology.  In summary, the increased interest in AI and distributed computing this year has coincided with a marked appreciation in several CPU-related assets, particularly those associated with AI technology.

42392827,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgCH4X,1690916256,"How AI, Web3 and Humans Can Work Together to Solve Complex, Global Problems","Cultural and regulatory conversation worldwide today show that there is a lot of fear around AI. AI is going to take over the world, it’s coming for everyone’s job, it’s going to destroy Hollywood: choose your own dystopian adventure. I don’t want any of those things to happen, either, but I’m an AI optimist at heart. There are a lot of things that humans are pretty bad at, and we should want AI to help us with those things, and work together with us to fix them, especially when it comes to solving complex problems.  That is the exact thing that the Web3 space has been addressing since the first Bitcoin block: how to coordinate big, decentralized, complex groups of people around a common purpose. I would propose that there are some areas where AI and Web3 combined can truly help society tackle its most complicated problems. Here’s one potential view of what this could look like, with 100% feasibility based on the state of the tech today.  Some things AI is good at:  Sourcing and consolidating a lot of information, even globally  Evaluating outcomes on a set of parameters  Carrying out research and tasks according to clear prompts from experts  Some things blockchains are good at:  Governance frameworks  Global pool of funds deployed across a variety of jurisdictions  Helping scale global networks of participants around a common protocol  Some things humans are good at:  Deep holistic expertise built from organic experience  Making informed and nuanced decisions  Sharing knowledge and enthusiasm on subjects they care about with communities  What happens when we mix all of these together in a symbiotic relationship to tackle a complex problem? I mean a REALLY complex, global-scale problem that has eluded humans for generations, or a “wicked problem,” like curing cancer. This requires coordinating the actions and wishes of thousands of people; making high stakes decisions about strategy and resource allocation; and a massive amount of management across many industries and jurisdictions.  How It Could All Work  So let’s imagine a Curing Cancer DAO. Founded by a consortium of scientific research labs, academic departments, and disease communities, totaling 1,000 people at the start. They decide on their shared mission and assign a small governance group of experts who will make strategic decisions. They initiate a DAO with membership NFTs for each participant with different governance responsibility levels and allocate a pool of funding to kick it off, and they instate an AI agent to manage the project as it scales.  The governance board assigns a list of KPIs to the AI agent, asking it to complete a set of management tasks for the community. Let’s say those start out as: manage donations to the treasury, keep track of new members, and disburse payments for work done on behalf of the DAO according to a clear set of deliverables. This will save a lot of time and overhead, which tend to consume a lot of resources for a not-for-profit organization or for a DAO.  More importantly, the board also tasks the AI agent with assessing the requirements to make progress on curing cancer and crafting a proposal with a roadmap of work, sub-projects, possible participants and institutions around the world who would be good to get involved, and specific tasks that will need to be done. The agent comes up with a long-term plan and proposes a set of steps to execute on it, then submits to the board of experts for review.  The board makes adjustments and prioritizes across the proposed roadmap from the AI to cover the first six months of work on Curing Cancer DAO. They empower the AI agent to recruit people to do those tasks, assign people work (no matter how big or small), and assess how well the work was done, paying them from the treasury.  The AI agent creates updates to the roadmap and reports progress frequently to all stakeholders in the DAO, managing a global view of this complex project in a way that makes it much easier for local contributions to be made effectively and in real-time context. Over time, it can expand the project by proposing sub-communities, managing experiments, and helping coordinate across the growing membership, even interacting with multiple boards managing different areas of expertise.  The DAO board can veto any proposal from the agent or rework it so things can get more efficient as they make progress. Over time, if the governance board observes that the AI agent is not doing well at something, they can commission new training data in that specific area in order to improve the model and fine-tune it to fit their needs. This can even be crowd sourced onchain from among an expert community, who can review the work and assess the AI agent’s improvement.  AI, Web3’s Role  This vision actually wouldn’t be possible without both AI and Web3. We need the Web3 part for governance, for the financial aspect, for the coordination tooling. All of the AI’s actions are onchain, membership of the group and donations are managed via blockchain tooling, and it can work directly with the DAO treasury to carry out transactions with total transparency. AI can streamline every part of the process of running the Curing Cancer DAO, as long as it is working alongside expert humans and with oversight and transparency assisted by blockchains. If it’s all on a blockchain, we can monitor risk and manage trust much better than we can even in today’s primarily social systems.  This is a very high level example, but I hope it prompts us to think in an optimistic direction about how we can become more effective at problem solving when we use AI and Web3 creatively. We will be able to scale up a lot of things that have been too complicated to manage just socially, or just with top-down command and control, or just with blockchains. This decentralized science community-building example could also apply to any global coordination problem or research effort.  None of these technologies are as interesting in isolation as they are when combined: It’s not about AI doing whole jobs themselves, but rather, about it doing what we are bad at, and helping us coordinate and do it faster. We will start to see some powerful experiments emerging in the next few years if we focus on productive building with proactive risk management, instating checks and balances that maximize the best of human and tech participants in service of a shared mission.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Illia Polosukhin,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/08/01/how-ai-web3-and-humans-can-work-together-to-solve-complex-global-problems,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bfea78edd09840fea6d4e50d429e4feaed3126b7-5700x3800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42392831,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgCHP3,1690916034,"Bitcoin Looking Oversold, but Any Bounce Could Be Disappointing","Bitcoin momentum has been in a tailspin since late June  History dictates that the response will be to level out, rather than spike higher  As bitcoin (BTC) begins August by continuing late July’s decline, a widely used technical indicator is showing the crypto approaching oversold levels. Bitcoin’s trading history, however, implies that the response may be mild.  Bitcoin momentum is in the midst of a nosedive. Its Relative Strength Index (RSI) figure has tumbled 47% since June 23 from 73.52 to 39. Volatility has cratered as well, with bitcoin’s Average True Range (ATR) down 40% over the identical time period.  Where the ATR measures the magnitude and spread of price moves, RSI is a technical indicator that incorporates velocity, and thus serves as a proxy for asset momentum.  As a rule of thumb, readings over 70 imply that an asset is overbought, while readings under 30 imply an oversold condition. Traders sometimes incorporate RSI levels in their trading strategies to determine entry and exit points for an asset.  Conventional wisdom would suggest that bitcoin’s current trajectory would lead to an eventual uptick in prices, but past history indicates that traders will need to be patient.  Since 2015 BTC has proven to be an asset that performs better when its RSI is 70 or higher, as opposed to when it falls below 30, i.e. it does better when in overbought territory than when oversold. The crypto’s average 30-day gain when in overbought conditions has been more than 13%, while its 30-day advance when showing as oversold has been just under 8%.  When filtering BTC’s RSI to the current range between 39 and 40, the performance is even more muted, with an average 30 day increase of just 4% over 64 prior occurrences.  This isn’t exactly horrible news for bitcoiners as the historic performance is still positive. But for traders expecting a big bounce higher from current levels, they may be disappointed.  The CoinDesk Indices Bitcoin Trend Indicator identified a neutral signal for bitcoin on July 24 and prices have been steady since, notwithstanding today’s 1% decline.  What could break bitcoin out of this recent morass?  Unfortunately for bulls, there doesn’t appear to be much on the horizon to change current market dynamics. On a macroeconomic level, there will be plenty of economic reports, but they are unlikely to show anything different than the ongoing story of continued growth and modestly slowing inflation. There is no Federal Reserve meeting in August, but the central bank’s Jackson Hole conference late in the month and Chairman Jerome Powell’s keynote speech might give a clue about the shape of future monetary policy. Few, however, are expecting Powell to deviate very far from the Fed’s recent vigilance against inflation.  Upcoming SEC decisions surrounding recent spot bitcoin ETF filings are likely to be the next catalyzing event, but any news in that regard might not come until after Labor Day, and there’s no guarantee it will be positive..  In some ways BTC appears to have matured as an asset. Where it once behaved as a toddler, reacting feverishly to any and every piece of stimuli, it now behaves like a brooding teen, reluctant to move for anything outside of the most significant of factors.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/08/01/bitcoin-looking-oversold-but-any-bounce-could-be-disappointing,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8ed02917aeb654f40a157e939143fa68354513d6-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42392816,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgCGA7,1690915670,Don’t Pop the Champagne on U.S. Crypto Bills – Progress in Congress Has Been Costly,"Getting past the House committee stage marks a major win for crypto legislation, but if the overall House approves them, the bills face a potentially hostile Senate and White House.  Even if the debate stretches into another year, crypto lobbyists are cheering several Democrat lawmakers’ willingness to stand against their party to reject the status quo.  The crypto industry has never made it this far in its quest for a new system of U.S. oversight for digital assets, but the recent flurry of legislative progress may still be too contentious for it to become law.  Three major fronts have emerged in digital assets legislation. One effort would finally set up wide-ranging rules for the industry, another would address stablecoins and a third would tackle the dangers of money laundering in crypto. They all saw a surge forward last week, but each of them also faces a minefield that may be insurmountable in the short term.  The industry is desperate for U.S. regulations that allow it to cast off investor uncertainties and take its place as a mature, fully functioning part of the economy. To get that – instead of the accelerating legal fight it’s waging with regulators – crypto needs new laws that define how it should work and which agencies should be doing what.  The drive toward a comprehensive law that governs how crypto will operate in the U.S. saw one leading proposal clear two committees in the House of Representatives last week. The legislation – which would set up the Commodity Futures Trading Commission with more direct crypto authorities – has been led by Republicans but saw a surprising cadre of Democratic supporters bucking their leadership to get on board. Still, it’s unlikely to get signoff as-is from Senate Democrats and the White House.  “I think market structure, realistically, it’s going to probably be a two-year thing,” said Ron Hammond, director of government relations for the Blockchain Association in Washington. But he said crypto proponents are “really pleasantly surprised” by how the Republican-driven initiative cleared the two committees. “The market structure bill won a variety of Democrats on a variety of fronts.”  Despite bipartisan legislation in the Senate from Sens. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) that generally overlaps a lot of the proposals in the House bill, the Senate Banking Committee has been a black box this year on its regulatory intentions for crypto. That panel’s chairman, Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), has been starkly critical of the digital assets sector and shown little enthusiasm for weighing in.  Even if legislation clears that committee, it needs to advance through a divided Senate in which both parties typically need to be on board for anything to happen.  Stablecoin bill  The day after the House Financial Services Committee endorsed that first standalone crypto-regulation bill to clear a committee, it was back in session to consider the narrower bill that targets stablecoin oversight. The Committee – all of its Republicans and a handful of Democrats – voted to forward that legislation, too. Such a bill has often been seen as having the best chance to survive the congressional gauntlet, because both sides agree on most of the main points and they’d worked together on it from its early days last year. But negotiations on this version – a complex system of licensing and government supervision in which both states and federal agencies would play roles – broke down in the hours before its vote.  People familiar with the talks said that at the last moment, the White House’s National Economic Council, led by Lael Brainard, dumped cold water on it, saying it didn’t put federal regulators in a strong enough role – a position echoed by officials from the Treasury Department and at the Federal Reserve, the regulator that Democrats have argued should be the final voice in supervising stablecoins and licensing their issuers. So stablecoins are the latest battleground in the ancient fed-versus-states congressional clash.  Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), chair of the House committee voting on the bill, railed against this 11th-hour interference that robbed the effort of most of its potential Democratic support. However, the public markup hearing – as contentious as it was – ended with several Democrats again defying the opposition of ranking Democrat Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) and voting yes to send it to the floor.  “If the House manages to pass the bill, it's unclear whether the Senate will,” said Charleyne Biondi, an analyst at Moody’s. “The debates are likely to drag on, and we are not very optimistic about the fact that the proposal would advance at this stage as the bill does not seem to be a top priority for the Senate.”  In Schoolhouse Rock simplicity, U.S. bills get introduced, get bashed about in committees, get sent to the floor where they get overhauled some more and finally get a floor vote. Then both chambers – the House and Senate – need to agree on a final version the president can sign (or not). In that process, these bills are now about a third of the way through – heading toward the floor of the House.  Money laundering amendment  The last of the trio of legislative fronts may be the most likely to end up a reality, but it’s further down the list of the crypto industry’s Washington priorities. Several senators from both parties have been seeking to bounce money launderers from crypto, and some of them are insisting that industry firms keep tabs on their customers’ identities. Last week, some lawmakers managed to attach an amendment to a defense spending bill that would check off several of their aims.  The amendment – in the Senate’s version of the spending bill – was authored by a diverse crew: Sens. Lummis and Gillibrand, who have pushed their own comprehensive crypto legislation, plus Sen. Roger Marshall (R-Kansas) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), one of the industry’s most enthusiastic critics. It calls for the Secretary of the Treasury to “establish examination standards for crypto assets” to help examiners work out how businesses are meeting sanctions demands and guarding against money laundering. It also required the Treasury to study anonymity in crypto transactions, including the use of so-called mixers.  “We believe this measure is the most likely to pass in this Congress,” Jaret Seiberg, an analyst at Cowen Group, wrote in a research note. He contended that this limited amendment could lay “the framework for other crypto bills by tackling upfront concerns over money laundering and sanctions evasion.”  To get to the president’s desk this year, lawmakers from both chambers will have to let it slide through in the combined defense package that melds the versions from the House and the Senate. It’s uncertain whether this provision will make the cut during those negotiations, but Seiberg argued it has a good chance.  Warren has a bigger goal and has been trying to build support for her own wider bill that would insist on Bank Secrecy Act money-laundering controls on crypto entities, including miners, validators and digital wallets. The bill is also backed by Sen. Marshall and other key names that Warren wouldn’t often be seen paired with: Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.V.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). Their legislation is seeking to ban financial firms from dealing with services that allow for anonymous crypto transactions – forcing a “know your customer” regime that is familiar to traditional finance.  For now, she may just have to take the partial win of the amendment, Seiberg suggested, which could eventually produce a Treasury report that gives her bigger bill more momentum.  Unusual bedfellows  And while Warren waits, she’s been joined by unusual bedfellows as Wall Street bankers – ever interested in countering crypto competition from the unregulated fringes of finance – lend their support. Despite the history of animosity between Wall Street and Warren, that industry’s lobbying group, the Bank Policy Institute, praised the bill as an attempt “to defend our nation’s financial system against illicit finance in all its forms.”  Another banking group, the American Bankers Association, had similarly weighed in on the stablecoin debate, sending a letter to McHenry and Waters at the House Financial Services Committee asking the lawmakers to apply the same federal oversight to stablecoin issuers as the government does to state-chartered banks. In a quick response, Chair McHenry called the letter “disappointing” and said it mischaracterized what the stablecoin bill was doing and ignored the things they’d already done to benefit banks.  When it comes to crypto issues, bank lobbyists’ usual friendliness with Republicans has sometimes been turned on its head. While crypto lobbyists have liked to say digital assets are nonpartisan, Republicans have generally stepped forward as the industry’s most reliable allies, but a lot of murkiness remains. And the fact that Democrats broke ranks to push the latest legislation forward isn’t going unnoticed. Democratic Reps. Jim Himes (D-Conn.), Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.), Ritchie Torres (D-N.Y.), Steven Horsford (D-Nev.), Wiley Nickel (D-N.C.) and Brittany Pettersen (D-Colo.) took a stand against their own party on the wide market-structure bill, and that may be the best outcome pro-crypto forces could have hoped for. The lawmakers' votes indicate they disagree with Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler that existing law is sufficient for policing crypto. They don’t think the status quo is working.  Even if the push on all this crypto legislation fails again this year, it hasn’t necessarily been a waste of time.  “Congress is designed to be a deliberative body, which can make legislating a long and difficult process,” said Brett Quick, head of government affairs at the Crypto Council for Innovation. “It is important to remember that even in the absence of the president's signature, these proposals will serve as the foundation for ongoing considerations around regulating crypto in the United States.”  Election headwinds  The extra complicating factor at the moment is that every day that goes by pushes Washington closer to the quadrennial presidential cage match that often leaves the capital in its most politically caustic and legislatively inefficient state. And Congress is now heading into its summer break, which moves the lawmakers several weeks closer to the 2024 election year.  One of the candidates for president is Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), the senior Republican in the Senate Banking Committee, who would customarily be in a significant position to play a role in financial legislation. But pushing a crypto bill may not be politically astute for somebody courting mainstream voters, especially if it comes with a loud, partisan fight.  Still, Republican lawmakers on the financial services committee are reaching out to see if something can be done to find common ground with the Democrats and administration on the stablecoin legislation. People familiar with the process said that hope hasn’t been extinguished on the effort this year, despite the hard feelings exhibited in last week’s hearing.  “I wouldn’t call the stablecoin bill dead,” said Blockchain Association’s Hammond.

42392814,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgCG4z,1690914838,DeFi Died and We Didn’t Even Notice,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) died yesterday. No protocols actually failed or tokens crashed to zero – though that was a distinct possibility. The interlinked economy of intermediary-less lenders, exchanges and trading tools is still, technically speaking, chugging along.  But the spirit that propelled DeFi forward, the dream of disintermediating money from power and providing easy access to basic and complex financial products without fear or favor is dead. And it wasn’t the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that did it, but DeFi itself.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  On Monday, following a significant if not particularly lucrative series of attacks on several DeFi platforms including the systemically important Curve Finance, Curve founder Michael Egorov found himself in a precarious position as hundreds of millions of worth of personal loans he took out were in danger of liquidation.  Months earlier, Egorov had massively leveraged up on CRV tokens he earned from his role helping to launch Curve, one of the most used decentralized exchanges. In one loan, on open lending protocol Aave alone, Egorov had put something like 34% of the total supply of CRV tokens on the table to take out $63 million worth of stablecoins. He was active elsewhere, loaning out as much as 460 million CRV tokens – or 47% of the total supply – for $110 million.  See also: Crisis at DeFi Giant Curve Eases After Justin Sun and Others Step In With Help  The hack of at least three Curve trading pools on Sunday had put downward pressure on those loans, and had CRV dropped below a certain price (~$0.35) it would have triggered the programmatic sell off of Egorov’s loan collateral. That would have likely kicked off a vicious cycle where the CRV price would continue to drop, forcing other loans into liquidation, which would cause CRV to drop even lower.  That’s what’s known as a “death spiral.” CRV is used as collateral across the DeFi ecosystem, and the fallout could have brought the sector to its knees.  None of this came to pass, however, due to a series of behind-the-scene deals Egorov made last night with monied traders like TRON founder Justin Sun. He was able to pay off some of his debt, and buoy the price of CRV (now trading at around $.60).  Other people were pushing for platform founders like Aave CEO Stani Kulechov to intervene in the markets – not by disabling the protocol necessarily, but possibly tapping into an Aave insurance fund or using a Safety Module that can be flipped on in extreme situations (the system that Aave stakers actually pay into).  In the wrong?  This wouldn’t have been the first time a DeFi giant like Egorov would have been bailed out or the first time bad judgment caught up with someone in crypto.  Even more, Egorov arguably did nothing wrong: He followed the pre-written rules of a few loan making platforms to do what is essentially crypto’s version of a popular tax-minimizing technique in the larger tech sector. If “paper billionaires” like Peter Thiel go to banks to take out cash loans by pledging the stock equity they’ve built up by founding or investing in startups like Facebook, why can’t crypto founders do the same? That’s the name of the permissionless finance game.  But given how close DeFi came to death, it’s worth asking hard questions. Why exactly was Egorov allowed to amass nearly half the total CRV supply – a situation that is on the surface entirely antithetical to the supposed egalitarian aims of DeFi?  Why did no one intervene earlier? Why was such a critically important protocol allowed to be jeopardized? Why don’t lending protocols like Aave or Fraxlend (where Egorov’s loan was smaller, but at greater risk of going bad), have caps on the number, or percentage, of tokens people can borrow against?  Perhaps most importantly, as my colleague, Shaurya Malwa, suggested, why did “Richie rich devs” wait until the last minute for calamity to strike to take action? It’s not like this was a big secret. Research group Gauntlet was sending out warning signs as early as January about Egorov’s highly-leveraged financial position, though its formal proposal to freeze CRV on Aave V2 did not pass. Venture capitalists behind ParaFi, Framework and 1kx even sued Egorov this year, not because of his dangerous loan book but because they felt they were owed a greater equity stake in Curve as early backers.  The simple answer: it’s DeFi. Despite being based on a series of technically innovative, open source and interoperable protocols, it suffers from the same fundamental issues as the traditional finance sector. Greed is rampant. Hypocrisy is the norm. And as Dublin University assistant professor Paul Dylan-Ennis put it: DeFi’s ethos isn’t to build democratically, but only “so long as it's working.”  Egorov’s situation, even though it didn’t end in DeFi Armageddon, is more than just a “black eye” for the sector. It’s an indication that DeFi has been dead inside for years.  This column could just as easily be written as a hero's account of Egorov’s intervention, and the coming together of industry participants (who aren’t always naturally aligned) to rescue a highly important platform.  Egorov’s scrambling yesterday to shore up bad debt was in some sense trading wizardry – he repaid a 5.13 million FRAX stablecoin loan with money that was practically found under the couch cushions. Egorov didn’t respond to a request for comment, but certainly he understood the gravity of the situation and, in many ways, I’m glad he pulled through.  Justin Sun gave Egorov $2 million USDT from his Aave position for about $2.9 million of over-the-counter CRV tokens that could easily become worthless – something of a selfless act. Should he get a pat on the back? Afterall, he always seems willing to come to the rescue.  But none of this is heroic. If DeFi was ever really different, it’s now run by a few massive bag-holders. If it was ever really defiant, it’s now almost totally useless to everyday crypto holders who far from making money “yield farming” often get swallowed by trading fees and impossible things to understand like impermanent loss.  See also: Spooked by Curve Liquidation Threat, DeFi Protocols Defenses  There’s a real trend within crypto media and on Crypto Twitter to discuss any time something goes wrong in the industry as just another chaotic day.

Well, not really for me, ha ha, but look at how gross Caroline Ellison is, ha ha.

15530223,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=545291,1690914298,Why Is Bitcoin Price Down Today?,"Today, Bitcoin took another dive, this time to its lowest level since June 21. A check on Bitfinex reveals a BTC price slump to $28,641. Coinbase, America’s largest crypto exchange, reported an even more drastic drop to $28,478. Although the price bounced back slightly to hover just below $29,000 (-1.4% in the last 24 hours), the downward trend sparks questions. Why Is The Bitcoin Price On The Decline? James V. Straten, a renowned on-chain analyst, recently tweeted: “Bitcoin drops below $29,000 as open interest spikes while funding rates go lower. As a result of the biggest long liquidation since 24th July.” As the analyst states, Bitcoin’s price trend can be majorly attributed to long liquidations. The liquidation data from Coinglass indicates that $23.6 million in BTC longs were liquidated, a relatively small amount but significant considering the market’s state. In an illiquid market, smaller orders can significantly sway the market. According to data from Kaiko, BTC and ETH have seen a decline in 90-day realized volatility this year, with volatility levels currently hovering around two-year lows. Related Reading: Bitcoin Crucial Moment: Will Resistance At $29,500 Trigger A Sell-Off Or Surge? Moreover, Kaiko’s data also reveals that Bitcoin’s correlation with the S&P 500 continued to decline in July, falling to just 3%. The last time it was this low was back in August 2021. This suggests that the traditional financial market’s influence on Bitcoin’s price is waning, an impulse much needed at the moment. Analyst @52Skew noted that BTC Spot CVDs & Delta Retrospective were hinting at the downtrend. “There were clear signs of spot supply & sellers, especially on Coinbase. Aggregate Spot CVD indicated heavy supply prior to sell off: Price grinding higher into limit supply & market spot selling.” Meanwhile, renowned trader @exitpumpBTC pointed out on Twitter: “Someone sitting with 400 BTC buy wall at $28,900 on Binance spot orderbook. Fully closed my short.” This buy wall might provide some support for Bitcoin’s price at the current level. Bitcoin Market Sentiment Weighs On Price The Bitcoin Market Sentiment, as represented by the Fear & Greed Index, is presently at 50 – neutral. However, the sentiment on the Bitcoin and crypto market is lukewarm, despite BTC being up 76% year-to-date. The fading momentum seems to be due to the Bitcoin and crypto market’s current “summer slumber.” The bullish news seems already priced in, and volumes on exchanges are dwindling. Related Reading: US Presidential Candidate Defends Bitcoin, Calls Out Environmental Critics Interestingly, despite some major bullish developments for the broader crypto market, including Blackrock’s filing for a spot ETF and the victory for XRP and Ripple, the retail and institutional interest remains low. This is reflected in the low liquidity and volatility in the market. Remarkably, the crypto space has been rocked by an array of events recently. From the rise of liquidity absorbing meme coins to scam tokens, the market has seemingly descended into chaos. In the midst of all these, impending events such as the Curve (CRV) hack as well as fears of a potential DOJ action against Binance and Tether, continue to add anxiety to the market. In this uncertain state, there are no new investors to catapult the market upward. At press time, BTC traded at $28,990.

15528121,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=545323,1690909316,"Bitcoin Investor Sentiment Flips Toward Greed Despite Fall Below $29,000","Amid the turbulence, the Bitcoin price has finally fallen below the $29,000 support. This decline points to the bears taking over the market, but investor sentiment has not swung the way it normally would in such circumstances. Instead of swinging toward bearish momentum, investors are rather leaning toward greed, suggesting that they do not expect this decline to last. Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Moves Toward Greed The Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index measures investor sentiment toward the market by taking into account things like surveys, social media posts, market volume, and volatility, among others. The aggregate of these metrics is then used to determine if investors are feeling bearish or bullish. Related Reading: Litecoin Sharks Buy More Than 200,000 LTC Ahead Of Wednesday’s Halving The scale goes from 1-100 with 1-25 standing for extreme fear, 26-47 means fear, 54-75 means greed, and 76-100 represents extreme greed. The 48-53 level represents neutral sentiment, which is where the index has been for the last week. The direction in which the index points toward neutral is of interest here. On Monday, the index was sitting at a completely neutral score of 50. However, by Tuesday, the index is now sitting at a neutral score of 53. This move from 50 to 53 indicates that despite the price of BTC falling below $29,000, investors are still viewing it in a positive light. Otherwise, the index would’ve fallen below 50. Fear & Greed Index sitting at 53 | Source: alternative.me Given this, the chances that the current decline will not last long are high. This is because investors being bullish about BTC means they’re likely to put more money into it. Once such buying pressure begins to mount, then BTC could recover above $29,000 once more. Attention Remains On BTC On Monday, Bitcoinist reported an 82% spike in Bitcoin’s daily trading volume, indicating renewed interest in the digital asset. This saw BTC’s trading volume climb to $10.8 billion, but the cryptocurrency has still not slowed down. BTC’s daily trading volume also saw another significant jump on Tuesday, rising 22% in the 24-hour period. This brought the digital asset’s daily volume to $13.4 billion at the time of writing. This continuous rise reiterates the rising interest in the asset, showing that the move in the Fear & Greed Index toward the greed territory is not a fluke.

Kennedy Jr. suggested in a Twitter post on Sunday, though he did not say that this was his official stance.  ""At the very least, environmental argument should not be used as smokescreen to curtail freedom to transact,"" wrote Kennedy Jr, who is a long-time environment advocate, reiterating a point he made last week at a Twitter space hosed by bitcoin investor Scott Melker.  Some environmentalists and policy makers have expressed concerns around bitcoin's environmental impact due to the massive amounts of energy that are used to mine bitcoin. However, Kennedy has been courting bitcoin supporters lately, as well as advocating on their behalf.  Last month, the presidential candidate said that if elected, he planned to exempt bitcoin from capital gains tax when it is converted to U.S. dollars and that he would back the U.S. dollar with finite assets like gold, silver and bitcoin. His campaign debut was in May at the Bitcoin 2023 conference hosted in Miami.  Kennedy is a bitcoin investor himself. ""Right after the bitcoin conference, I decided to put my money where my mouth is and bought two bitcoin for each of my seven children,” Kennedy said during last week's Twitter space.  The presidential candidate is also known for trying to combine good business policies with ambitions to improve the environment, and once said at a conference in 2016 that “good environmental policy is good for economic prosperity.”  Americans will go to the polls to elect a president on Nov. 4 next year and so far incumbent president Joe Biden has been leading Kennedy by upwards of 50 points in recent polling.

42392828,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgCH9f,1690908478,How DeFi Protocols Are Building More Granular and Extensible Capabilities,"For the last few years, decentralized finance (DeFi) has emerged as a fundamental financial backbone of the digital assets space and as a parallel ecosystem to traditional financial markets. The space keeps evolving, creating new experiences and uses for participants.  The first few years of DeFi have been marked by the establishment of programmable financial primitives such as lending, automated market making (AMMs) or derivatives that could serve as building blocks of new financial services and applications. Lately, DeFi has begun powering more abstracted user experiences, building even smaller, more granular micro-primitives. This trend is happening everywhere in DeFi and challenges some of the established patterns in technology markets.  Jesus Rodriguez is the CEO of IntoTheBlock.  We are entering the era of DeFi micro-primitives.  DeFi micro-primitives are not an industry-acknowledged trend. I think we might be the first ones to have coined this term, but it seems to be happening everywhere. DeFi protocols are becoming more granular, more decentralized, more trustless and, yes, more complex. This trend seems a bit counterintuitive to the normal evolution of infrastructure technology and could have severe implications for the future of DeFi.  DeFi micro-primitives  Conceptually, the idea of DeFi micro-primitives is extremely simple. Imagine taking the functionalities of an automated market maker (AMM), such as pool rebalancing logic, token swapping, and fees collection, and customizing each of these functionalities using different smart contracts. In this way, each functionality becomes its own micro-primitive.  Let's explore the notion of DeFi micro-primitives through the lens of familiar DeFi protocols:  Uniswap v4: The proposed architecture for the largest AMM introduces the notion of Hooks as smart contracts that can incorporate logic across the lifecycle of pools. Unlike the current versions of UniSwap that include a single approach for managing the lifecycle of pools, v4 changes that by introducing new micro-primitives. For instance, Hooks can execute post-trade arbitrage logic and auto-compound LP fees to change the rebalancing logic.  Eigen Layer: This popular platform that pioneered the restaking approach can be seen as a collection of micro-primitives for validators. Traditionally, validator clients encapsulate the entire logic of the validation process. However, Eigen Layer introduces the concept of an Open Marketplace that includes different security capabilities for validators. In this marketplace, validators can opt-in for each micro-primitive to enhance their capabilities.  Maker: In their recently published Endgame, Maker fragments its capabilities further by introducing the notion of SubDAOs. Before SubDAOs, all functionalities of the Maker protocol were governed by a single governance and tokenomics process. The goal of the Endgame is to allow each SubDAO to focus on specific capabilities of Maker and follow its own governance process and tokenomics.  Flashbots: The main MEV protocol is working towards the implementation of the Single Unifying Auction for Value Expression (SUAVE), which introduces new micro-primitives by unbundling the block builder and mempool roles from existing blockchains, offering a plug-and-play alternative. The current version of Flashbots has already taken some steps towards more decentralization with the separation of the proposer and builder roles, and now SUAVE is expanding that pattern with more micro-primitives. The SUAVE architecture includes micro-primitives such as the optimal execution market, which allows multiple executors to add their logic to provide the best execution for a given transaction.  There are plenty of other examples of DeFi micro-primitives within the new generation of DeFi protocols. By employing DeFi micro-primitives, these protocols are becoming more customizable, decentralized, and capable of offering a wider range of services. This trend could significantly shape the future of DeFi and its applications.  Counterintuitive DeFi micro-primitives  To some, the move to granular and extensible DeFi micro-primitives might seem counterintuitive. After DeFi has built a strong foundation for capital formation and trading with primitives such as AMMs, lending, bridges, or derivatives, one might argue that the obvious step is to create higher-level experiences that attract more capital into the space. Certainly, there are initiatives in that area, but now we have this trend of DeFi micro-primitives, which can certainly make the user experience in the space more complex.  Read more: Jesus Rodriguez - A New Blockchain for Generative AI?  The obvious benefit of the DeFi micro-primitive movement is that it makes DeFi more extensible, programmable and composable. An additional interesting benefit is that it might reduce the number of unnecessary forks of DeFi protocols when adding a handful of features, as these features can be well encapsulated as micro-primitives of the parent protocol. This could also lead to the reusability of security and robustness from larger DeFi protocols for smaller functionalities, avoiding the need to build smaller and potentially more vulnerable forks.  However, the DeFi micro-primitives trend also introduces plenty of challenges. For starters, the surface for attacks in DeFi protocols based on micro-primitives is drastically larger than that of more monolithic alternatives.  For instance, think about Uniswap v4 using hundreds of Hooks, each with several potential attack vectors. Additionally, if the level of complexity of DeFi micro-primitives is too high, it might hinder developer adoption, effectively making DeFi protocols more vulnerable with no obvious benefit in adoption. Striking the right balance between granularity and complexity becomes crucial for the success of this trend.  A more granular DeFi  In the coming months, we can expect more DeFi protocols to divide their functionalities into extensible, programmable micro-primitives. This will lead to a DeFi landscape that is more granular, flexible, and developer-friendly, but also more complex. If DeFi is to become a true parallel alternative to traditional finance, primitives such as lending and AMMs won't be sufficient to build sophisticated financial services. Smaller, more targeted, and programmable micro-primitives are necessary. As DeFi continues to evolve, the adoption of these smaller, focused building blocks will likely play a significant role in shaping the future of decentralized finance.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Jesus Rodriguez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/08/01/how-defi-protocols-are-building-more-granular-and-extensible-capabilities,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/36bc8cf7f23ea6f55602efb4cecc421e2ab1495c-4488x3366.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Terraform Labs Fails to Follow the Road taken by Ripple against SEC Last month, Ripple Labs celebrated its partial but remarkable victory in the 3-year-long battle against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Judge Analisa Torres partially ruled in favor of Ripple, stating that XRP should not be considered a security in regard to programmatic sales and “other distributions” (although it is considered a security in regard to institutional sales). Facing a similar lawsuit, another crypto company Terraform Labs tried to take advantage of the Ripple’s case ruling and filed a motion for the dismissal of the suit using the Ripple’s victory as an argument. However, Judge Jed Rakoff of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York denied the motion and firmly confirmed that the civil case against Terraform and its founder Do Kwon would move forward. Moreover, Judge Rakoff rejected to consider the categorization of sales used in the Ripple case, thus criticizing the approach taken by Judge Torres: ""It may also be mentioned that the Court declines to draw a distinction between these coins based on their manner of sale, such that coins sold directly to institutional investors are considered securities and those sold through secondary market transactions to retail investors are not. In doing so, the Court rejects the approach recently adopted by another judge of this District in a similar case,"" wrote Judge Rakoff. What Does It Mean for Ripple? Even though Judge Rakoff’s criticism doesn’t overturn Judge Torres’ decision in the Ripple case, it might increase the chances of the SEC filing an appeal. Last week, a law expert James Murphy outlined four major paths that the SEC could take next. He believes that the SEC is much more likely to file a request for an interlocutory appeal than settle. Meanwhile, Ripple CTO David Schwart reacted to Judge Rakoff’s ruling on his Twitter observing that the reasoning seems to be unusual and doesn’t apply to typical cryptocurrencies. Schwart then suggested the worst-case and the best-case future scenarios regarding Ripple Labs: “1) The worst case for fans of the decision in Ripple: The court is saying it disagrees with the Ripple decision because it applies additional tests that are not part of the Howey test and so it won't apply/follow the ruling here. 2) The best case for fans of the decision in Ripple: The court is saying it disagrees with the argument that it should follow the Ripple decision because the reasoning relied on in Ripple makes sense not because it directly implicates the Howey factors but because it indirectly implicates them due to facts not applicable in this case.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Ramaswamy was discussing the need for the U.S. Federal Reserve to focus solely on dollar stability.  U.S. presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, a Republican, said that while he is a fan of bitcoin, he would not embrace the cryptocurrency as a commodity to help stabilize the U.S. dollar. His stance contrasts with Democratic candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who said last month that he supported backing the dollar with bitcoin.  Ramaswamy, who accepts bitcoin donations for his 2024 election campaign, made the comment during an appearance on the Timcast IRL podcast hosted by Tim Pool. He was outlining his stance that the U.S. Federal Reserve should focus solely on stabilizing the dollar as a unit of measurement against commodities. As he listed examples of the commodities, Pool asked, “Bitcoin?”  “I think that bitcoin, for me, for a number of reasons, does not yet meet that commodity basket,” Ramaswamy said. “I’m a bitcoin fan. I spoke at a bitcoin conference. I want to stabilize the dollar against agriculture and farm commodities, gold, silver and nickel.”  “And there could be a point in time when bitcoin becomes part of that commodity basket. There’s some technical reasons why I would not include that today,” he continued.  CoinDesk reached out to Ramaswamy’s campaign for more details, but had not received a reply by publication time. In May, he told CoinDesk he was the only candidate who understands bitcoin deeply enough to have an intelligent discussion on a presidential debate stage.  The 37-year-old worked as a partner at a hedge fund before leaving to form the drug discovery-focused biotech company, Roivent Sciences. Last year, he co-founded the asset management firm Strive Asset Management, which has more than $750 million in assets under management. He is also the author of a book titled “Woke, Inc.: Inside Corporate America’s Social Justice Scam.”  In February, Ramaswamy announced his candidacy for the Republican Party’s nomination for president. According to the election data site FiveThirtyEight, he was polling at 6.9% among declared or presumed Republicans, which puts him in third place behind former president Donald Trump at 53.4% and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis at 15.6% in a crowded field of candidates.

Rather than wait for liquidation chaos, some protocols are taking active measures.  Decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols are angling to protect themselves from the hack of Curve Finance and the threat of potentially catastrophic liquidations.  Curve founder Michael Egorov’s penchant for borrowing tens of millions of dollars in tokens against his CRV holdings has pinned a handful of on-chain lending markets up against the wall. If the price of CRV falls too low and they’re forced to try and liquidate his collateral at a time when buyers are slim, they could sell low and suffer crippling debts – creating a systemic risk for all of DeFi.  Read more: Crisis at DeFi Giant Curve Eases After Justin Sun and Others Step In With Help  The DAO that governs lending platform Abracadabra, from which Egorov had once borrowed $18 million, has decided it’s better to hold CRV through a crisis than to sell into a liquidation cascade. Last night, it approved an emergency measure to change how it tracks those tokens’ prices “to prevent any inadvertent selling of CRV tokens” that would accumulate bad debt. (DAO contributor Romy told CoinDesk the measure is temporary.)  Another area of focus for teams has been reinforcing the links that lock DeFi protocols together. Last night, a representative for the stablecoin-focused Reserve Protocol, which builds on top of DeFi majors, including Lido, Compound and Rocketpool, asked in their respective Discords for help to establish “a more robust incident response strategy” so that its developers can coordinate across teams during crises such as Curve.  For Nexus Mutual, an insurance-like service that offers users some protection against losses they suffer from hacks, the weekend assault on Curve will likely lead to a wave of new claims when it opens its portal on Wednesday. The protocol is encouraging its customers to “wait until more information is available” so that it can more accurately assess what they’re owed.  Read more: After the Curve Attack: What’s Next for DeFi?  On Tuesday, after days of Egorov selling assets to pay back lenders, the mood across DeFi was hardly grim but perhaps still skittish.

15526026,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4622156-coinbase-major-questions-remain?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,1690904265,Coinbase: Major Questions Remain,"Summary Coinbase faces potential legal action from the SEC and several US states, but investors have largely ignored this news. Q2 results could show a drop in Bitcoin trading volumes, potentially leading to a sequential revenue decline. Analysts are predicting a sequential rise in quarterly revenues for Q3, but the risk of weak guidance remains. Back in May, I detailed how the first half of Q2 was not looking good for cryptocurrency platform Coinbase ( COIN ). Between Bitcoin trading volumes falling as compared to Q1 levels as well as USDC's market cap sinking, it looked like the company would be missing revenue estimates for the period. Since then, key metrics in the crypto space have weakened even more, yet Coinbase shares have been one of the year's winners. At this point, investors need to get some major answers from the company. Amazingly, investors have mostly shrugged off what could be very bad news for Coinbase. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has filed a lawsuit against the company for operating as an unregistered securities broker. A number of US states are also looking at potential legal action against the company, although Coinbase intends to defend itself quite vigorously. The street will be waiting to hear from management at the Q2 report if the SEC news caused any meaningful amount of money to be pulled off the platform. In the near term, it will be very interesting to see how Coinbase results fare. When the company reported its Q1 2023 results, Bitcoin volumes to date in Q2 were down about 24.5% sequentially. Coinbase generated approximately $110 million of transaction revenue in April as crypto asset volatility declined. In Q1, that segment of the business averaged about $125 million per month in revenue. For all of Q2, Bitcoin trading volume ended up down roughly 37.5% sequentially. Coinbase would have likely needed to pick up a significant amount of market share to overcome that potential revenue loss. Subscription and services revenue guidance for Q2 was about $300 million, which would be down more than $60 million on a sequential basis. Coinbase management noted in its Q1 letter that the average USDC market cap in April was $31.7 billion, 23% lower than the Q1 average of $41.3 billion. USDC is a key driver of interest income, and as the chart below shows, the amount in circulation continues to hit new multi-month lows almost weekly. USDC In Circulation (Circle) Given what management guided to, and the continued declines in both USDC market cap (circulation amount) and Bitcoin volume since, one might think that Coinbase is on track to report a Q2 revenue print in the low to mid $600 million range. The company delivered net revenues of $736 million in Q1, but just since my previous article in May, the average Q2 estimate has come down from $686 million to about $640 million. I had been concerned for some time that a Q2 revenue miss was likely, but that chance keeps coming down as analysts further reduce their numbers. The company will report this Thursday, after the closing bell. The overall average is also being held up a bit by a high estimate of nearly $841 million that seems quite unrealistic at this point. As shown above, USDC in circulation has weakened another billion dollars plus since the end of Q2. At the same time, Bitcoin trading volume in the first 30 days of the quarter is down another 27.56% over the first 30 days of Q2 according to Yahoo! Finance. At the moment, however, analysts are looking for a sequential rise in quarterly revenues to more than $671 million, which means the risk of guidance being weak is certainly there. The recent surge in Coinbase shares also brings into question the overall valuation argument. The average price target on the street is currently a little under $77, implying about 22% downside from current levels. When I last covered the name, analysts saw tremendous upside in the stock, but shares have rallied significantly since. At the moment, I wouldn't be rushing to make a major move on Coinbase shares in either direction. I think that near term results won't be great if Bitcoin trading volumes and the USDC market cap continue to struggle. However, the potential for a Bitcoin ETF has certainly ignited some bullishness in the crypto space, and a continued surge in Bitcoin itself would likely send Coinbase shares higher in the near term. One of this year's biggest winners has been Coinbase, which is up almost 194% so far in 2023. While shares have mostly tracked the price action of Bitcoin itself, trading volumes of the cryptocurrency have been weak and USDC's market cap has dropped significantly. At the same time, the company has been sued by the SEC regarding its business practices. This week's earnings report should provide some major insight into these key items, which will determine if the surge in shares can hold.",NEGATIVE,USDC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING | USDC,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4622156-coinbase-major-questions-remain?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/15526026.jpeg

The Restart of the FTX Offshore Exchange Will Depend on its Creditors On July 31, 2023, the bankrupt crypto exchange FTX Trading Ltd. filed a Draft Plan of Reorganization and a Term Sheet, confirming the rumors about a possible relaunch of the platform. According to the plan, FTX divided its claimants into different categories: FTX.com offshore exchange customers, referred to as “dotcom customers”; the U.S. exchange customers; customers of the non-fungible token (NFT) exchange; general unsecured claims; secured claims; and subordinated claims. The international “dotcom” users have the option to pool their assets and create a “rebooted” offshore FTX exchange, not available in the US. In this case, these customers are entitled to get a stake in the new platform instead of receiving a cash payout: “Rather than all cash, the Debtors may determine that the Offshore Exchange Company remit non-cash consideration to the Dotcom Customer Pool in the form of equity securities, tokens or other interests in the Offshore Exchange Company, or rights to invest in such equity securities, tokens or other interests.” The proposal stated that FTX administrators will use “the waterfall approach” to determine the priority of claims. This means that each class will receive a pro-rata payout from the pool of remaining assets after the payout to the preceding class is finished. What about FTT and its Holders? In response to the news, the FTX token jumped by about 15% reaching the mark of $1.55, even though it pulled back to $1.4 shortly after. However, the plan clarified that the FTT holders won’t receive any compensation for their losses as their claims are to be canceled and extinguished: “Claims by holders of FTT (whether or not held on any FTX exchange), preferred stock and equity investors in the Debtors and related claims. All these claims and interests will be canceled and extinguished as of the Effective Date and holders will not receive any distribution.” Moreover, there are rumors that the FTX token will be eliminated altogether, and the claimants will receive their payout in USD as of the date of bankruptcy. It’s also worth mentioning that FTT was previously labeled an unregistered security by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The FTX Drama Continues The defunct exchange still struggles to deal with other consequences of its sudden fall in November, 2022. Earlier today, it has been announced that FTX almost reached a resolution in its dispute with another bankrupt crypto company Genesis. Meanwhile, ex-CEO of FTX Sam Bankman-Fried is still facing seven charges related to wire fraud, securities fraud, and money laundering, partly for misappropriating the FTX customer funds. As of recent developments, Bankman-Fried agreed to a gag order while waiting for an update on his bail status. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

42392819,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgCGPV,1690902000,DeFi Platform Term Finance Brings Fixed Rate Lending to Ethereum,"Term Finance protects borrowers from DeFi’s variable rate loans which can fluctuate wildly during crypto’s recurrent liquidity events.  A weekly auction model means borrowers and lenders will never borrow at more than their predetermined max interest rate or lend below their minimum rate.  Term Finance, a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that offers short term, fixed interest rate loans, has gone live on the Ethereum mainnet.  The protocol is trying to bridge the gap between centralized crypto lenders and also offer users an alternative to variable rate borrowing, Dion Chu, CEO of the platform's builder Term Labs, explained in an interview with CoinDesk.  Centralized finance has taken a hit, mainly due to the numerous prominent collapses last year. However, in contrast the DeFi sector, which is dominated by the likes of Aave and Compound, has remain largely unnerved.  Aave and Compound are sort of ""DeFi banks,"" Chu said, with a kind of ""ultimate liquidity."" Meanwhile, Term Finance operates more like certificates of deposits, where users agree not to withdraw for a specified length of time. “They’re both kind of necessary primitives in DeFi. So Aave and Compound can always play the role of being a DeFi bank, and we hope to fill this role of short term, fixed rate liquidity,” he added.  Term Finance, which raised a $2.5 million seed round back in February, is also bringing auction methodology to the DeFi space, accustomed as it is to automated market makers (AMMs). Carrying out once-per-week auctions provides certainty to borrowers and lenders, who will never borrow at more than their predetermined max interest rate or lend below their minimum rate.  “What you’re doing is batching liquidity,” Chu said. “Because an AMM is ongoing, continuous liquidity, everything’s done asynchronously and it can take some time before it finds equilibrium, and there’s a little bit of a gaming aspect there. This type of batching of liquidity is good for nascent markets, and it’s very common. If you think about the New York Stock Exchange, it actually started as the daily auction, so it wasn’t a continuous market, as we know now.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/08/01/defi-platform-term-finance-brings-fixed-rate-lending-to-ethereum,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/90ded3a9942dd1cb6ab94a09417cdb294620dd33-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Also, Maker (MKR) recorded a massive price surge in July, and analysts are monitoring to see if this bullish momentum will hold through Q3 2023. On the other hand, Borroe ($ROE) is ready to disrupt decentralized fundraising, and the platform has already sold all of the Borroe ($ROE) tokens listed for its Beta presale stage. >>BUY $ROE TOKENS NOW Bitcoin (BTC) May Record a Price Surge in Late July 2023 Today, July 28, 2023, $2 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) options will expire. Historically, this monthly Bitcoin (BTC) options expiry is always associated with bullish volatility for Bitcoin (BTC). This time we could see Bitcoin’s (BTC) support level rise from $29,000 to $29,500. According to experts, the effects of Bitcoin (BTC) options expiry often take a few days to consolidate, and we may see Bitcoin (BTC) rise to $31,000 in the first few days of August 2023. Also, requests for Bitcoin (BTC) Spot ETFs could propel Bitcoin (BTC) to a greater price surge. If the US SEC approves the requests from Blackrock and Fidelity, Bitcoin (BTC) should break through its 2023 high. Interestingly, Bitcoin (BTC) hit this $31,657 high on July 13 after a US federal court ruling dealt a blow to the SEC’s crypto regulatory efforts. Bitcoin (BTC) turned bearish shortly after this price surge, and the token is currently trading at $29,180 on July 28. >>BUY $ROE TOKENS NOW Maker (MKR) Ecosystem Developments Trigger Massive Price Surge In May 2023, MakerDAO released a five-phase roadmap tagged ‘Endgame.’ According to Maker (MKR) developers, this upgrade will include a rebrand, a new blockchain, and the introduction of two new tokens. During this period, Rune Christensen (co-founder of Maker DAO) also revealed that Maker (MKR) users could initiate hard forks in response to power attacks or abuse. These ecosystem developments and the Maker (MKR) token burn led to a massive price surge last month. Maker (MKR) launched a Smart Burn Engine program that recently cleaned more than $230,000 worth of Maker (MKR) tokens from the market. As a result, we saw Maker (MKR) rise from $672 on June 28 to a current price of $1,167 on July 28. The token gained 72.84% this last month, and only a few tokens, like XRP and Borroe ($ROE), can match this surge in Q3 2023. Investors Are Betting on Borroe ($ROE) in August 2023, Token Set to Gain 300% Borroe ($ROE) is the world’s first web3 blockchain invoice discounting NFT marketplace. As a decentralized funding platform, Borroe ($ROE) helps web3 participants and content creators generate instant cash by selling future verifiable income. Borroe ($ROE) users can mint their subscriptions, royalties, digital payments, and invoices into NFTs. Afterwards, they sell these NFTs at discounted prices to supportive community members. Currently, Borroe ($ROE) is moving from its Beta stage to Stage 1 of its presale, as it has sold more than 25 million tokens so far. Borroe ($ROE) has surged by 25%, and it is selling at $0.0125. After all presale stages, Borroe ($ROE) will hit the mainstream crypto and sell for $0.0400. So if you invest in Borroe ($ROE) now, you’ll see a 220% rise in the value of your tokens in a few weeks.

42392829,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgCHEn,1690899632,Ripple Ruling Rebuke Complicates Coinbase’s Defense Against the SEC: Berenberg,"Coinbase (COIN) shares have outperformed the market following the U.S. District Court’s July 13 ruling that Ripple Labs did not violate securities laws by selling its XRP token on crypto exchanges. However, another judge from the same district offered an emphatic rejection of the Ripple ruling on Monday, investment bank Berenberg noted in a research report Tuesday.  ""In his ruling, U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff of the Southern District of New York rejected Judge Torres’ distinction between institutional sales and sales to retail investors on crypto exchanges, which he characterized as a misinterpretation of the Howey test used to determine if an asset is a security,” analysts led by Mark Palmer wrote.  Rakoff’s rejection potentially complicates Coinbase’s use of that ruling in its own case against the SEC, the analysts wrote. The bank notes that Judge Rakoff in his ruling made a direct reference to Judge Torres’ ruling in “asserting that the Howey test ‘makes no distinction between purchasers.’”  The Howey Test relates to the U.S. Supreme Court case for determining whether a transaction qualifies as an investment contract. If a transaction is considered to be an investment contract, it’s classified as a security.  Another of Coinbase’s defenses against the SEC’s case is the major questions doctrine, which is derived from a Supreme Court ruling that prevents agencies from exceeding their mandate, the report said. Terraform Labs invoked the doctrine in its own defense and Judge Rakoff rejected its use, dealing another potential blow to Coinbase’s defense.  Berenberg maintained its hold rating on Coinbase shares with a $39 price target, reflecting the bank’s view that the stock is “uninvestable” in the near term. Coinbase shares were down 8% to $90.85 in early trading on Tuesday, but have increased 155% so far this year. The crypto exchange reports its second-quarter earnings after the close on Thursday.

The four most popular NFTs, as well as two NFTs selected by Williams team drivers Alex Albon and Logan Sargeant, will be displayed on the car during the Austin-based Grand Prix on October 22.  Lou Frangella, Head of Brand Partnerships at Kraken and former VP of Partnerships at FTX.US, subsidiary of fallen exchange FTX, told CoinDesk that incorporating NFTs onto the back of Williams’ cars will bring attention not only to individual projects but also to the NFT market as a whole.  “NFTs are an essential part of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, and I think they represent many different things – they are ownership for some people, and there are very engaged communities in a lot of cases,” said Frangella. “Whenever we have the opportunity to lift up the crypto community, we want to use our platform to be able to do that.”  In March, Kraken announced its Williams sponsorship deal aimed at bringing crypto educational experiences to F1 fans across the globe. Frangella told CoinDesk that since the spring, Kraken has displayed the bitcoin white paper on the nose of Williams cars, celebrated Bitcoin Pizza Day with the team by sending pies to its 800 employees and hosted fan meet-ups at various racing events.  “We're just continuing to use our partnership as a way to properly educate and be a resource for people – not just F1 fans, but anyone that the sport crosses paths with, whether you're a Williams fan or not, to propel our mission,” said Frangella.  It didn’t take long for crypto sponsorships to find their place within the luxury sport of F1. In February 2022, Red Bull’s racing team signed a $150 million partnership with crypto exchange Bybit. Most recently, Sui blockchain also signed a multiyear deal with Red Bull, with a goal of bringing Web3 experiences to its fans.  While NFTs have yet to be seen on the race cars themselves, they’ve previously been present at racing events. In May, F1 ticket provider Platinum Group issued NFT tickets for the Monaco Grand Prix, offering buyers access to the race as well as future ticket discounts.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | TRADING | SUI,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/08/01/an-f1-team-might-take-a-bored-ape-across-the-us-grand-prix-finish-line,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fd0cf86e64f561bc4bf7492efe5b1e4f200d280c-1280x800.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Two months after launching its credit solution on the Huma platform, Jia is expanding its reach to accommodate the robust demand for credit in emerging markets, along with an increase in liquidity supply. “We are delighted to facilitate Jia's innovative approach to lending. Our platform's infrastructure is designed to foster next generation lending solutions, and together we're showcasing what fair and transparent lending looks like, making a tangible difference in people's lives."" says Erbil Karaman, CEO and Co-founder of Huma Finance. There is a $5 trillion credit gap in emerging markets, with many individuals lacking access to formal credit and the small business financing ($500-$2,000) they need, halting their day-to-day business interactions and ability to serve their communities. By utilizing Huma's DeFi infrastructure, Jia can expedite transactions with fairness and transparency, creating opportunities for entrepreneurs to grow their businesses. Jia is dedicated to serving small businesses in emerging markets. The company launched a $100,000 pool on Huma in May, which it has used to originate loans to more than 500 borrowers in Kenya and the Philippines. Within the next six months, Jia is planning to scale up their credit solution even more to $500k, an increase of 400%. This growth projection sets the tone for a further 5x increase in a year's time given the borrower and lender demand. Jia's pool reached full subscription less than 24 hours after launching, signaling a strong interest from accredited investors interested in this asset class. The capital raised has already created transformative change in these small businesses. With stories of borrowers like Dr. Elishaphan Obuya, a medical practitioner from Kisumu, Kenya, Jia’s impact becomes tangible. Dr. Obuya, the founder of Shepher Lifecare, offers a range of medical services to hundreds of patients monthly. With Jia’s credit solution, facilitated in partnership with Ilara Health, Dr. Obuya borrowed 142,800 KES ($1,012) to maintain a crucial supply of lifesaving medicines in his clinic. Another inspiring story comes from Kristel Erestingcol in Manila, Philippines. Kristel operates a sari-sari store, serving her community with essential food items and school supplies. With a Jia loan of PHP 10,000 ($182), her second from the platform, Kristel has not only been able to buy more inventory in bulk at lower prices, but also expand her store's offering into new product lines including school uniforms and clothing. ""Our mission is to drive economic growth in emerging markets by breaking down financial barriers. The extension of our credit solution on Huma is a testament to the potential we see in these markets,"" says Zach Marks, CEO and Co-founder of Jia. Jia's expansion on the Huma platform is a strong signal of how DeFi can move away from speculative use cases, and allow entrepreneurs and small businesses in emerging markets to access digital financial resources. Together, Jia and Huma are working on a roadmap to roll out features for a seamless real-world lending experience. With the financial ecosystem becoming increasingly borderless and inclusive, the realization of global financial freedom seems within grasp. About Jia Jia is expanding financial freedom across the globe. Jia provides blockchain-based financing to small businesses, then rewards borrowers who repay with ownership, enabling them to create wealth and prosperity for themselves and their communities.

Today, we will examine all three of these tokens in greater detail and determine their appeal. Moreover, we'll discuss why many crypto beginners gravitate toward them. Summary- Pepe shows a bullish technical analysis- Floki continues its uptrend- Pomerdoge expected to skyrocket by 17x Click Here To Find Out More About The Pomerdoge (POMD) Presale Pepe (PEPE): A Fun Meme-Coin Pepe (PEPE) was one of the top gainers in the meme coin market, offering early investors enormous gains in late June and early July. Given that the Pepe coin was created with no intrinsic value, this performance has been noteworthy. The Pepe coin price currently sits at $0.000001336 with a market cap of $523M, down 1.23% overnight. However, the Pepe technical analysis displays a bullish picture. In fact, all moving averages are showing buy signals. As a result, experts remain bullish on Pepe's long-term growth potential. Thus, forecast a jump to $0.00000179 for Pepe by December 2023. Floki (FLOKI): On an Upward Trajectory Inspired by the viral popularity of Elon Musk's pet Floki, the Floki Inu token quickly gained traction. Like other meme coins, Floki's price dynamics are influenced by market sentiment and social media buzz. In recent Floki Inu news, Binance Liquid Swap will sunset 31 liquidity pools, including FLOKI/USDT, as of August 4, 2023, at 4:00 a.m. UTC. But, this news did not impact the FlokiInu price, which now sits at $0.00002268 with a market cap of $213M. Hence, an increase of 1.43% in the last 24 hours. In addition, the Floki trading volume increased by 47.54% in that same time, reaching $15,579,332. With all these bullish signs, experts forecast Floki could surge to $0.00002986 within Q4 of 2023. Pomerdoge (POMD): Excellent Long-Term Growth Potential Pomerdoge (POMD) presents an enticing proposition for crypto beginners who want to combine gaming and earning. The project combines P2E mechanics with NFTs to create an immersive and rewarding gaming experience. Players can build up their characters, trade in-game items in the Pomerplace, and participate in exciting arena battles. One of the standout features of the project is the promise to reward presale investors with a percentage of the revenue generated from the game. This unique revenue-sharing model allows investors to earn rewards proportionately to their tokens, adding a lucrative element to the gaming experience. Moreover, to deliver a memorable and valuable gaming experience, Pomerdoge has curated a collection of 7,777 exclusive NFTs. Each NFT will be priced at 0.2 ETH, unlocking a world of possibilities for their owners. Nevertheless, the project has kept the benefits of owning these NFTs closely guarded until closer to the launch. To participate in the acquisition of these exclusive NFTs, investors must hold POMD tokens. Currently, POMD has a presale price of only $0.007. But, this price will not be this low for too long as the presale is in Phase One. Many experts are forecasting that it will surge by 17x before it finishes. With all these features, POMD may leave Pepe and Floki in the dust.

Tradecurve Skyrockets, Hits $4Million","According to CoinMarketCap, Tether (USDT) is the largest stablecoin in the cryptocurrency market. However, its safety has come under question in recent times. The question now is if Tether is the safest option for storing your crypto? Meanwhile, Tradecurve, a hybrid platform, has raised over $3 million in its presale, causing excitement among investors. >>Register For The Tradecurve Presale Is Tether (USDT) the Safest Stablecoin To Store Your Crypto? Tether (USDT) is the top stablecoin in the crypto market with a market capitalization of over $83 billion. Meanwhile, there are several factors to consider when ascertaining the safety of a stablecoin. One is the assets backing the stablecoin like gold, government treasury bills, etc. Also, the stablecoin issuer must have sufficient funds available to fulfill all redemption requests. Despite being embroiled in controversy over the past year, the Tether coin has recently implemented measures to enhance transparency within its operations. Notably, the platform now publishes regular audits of its USD reserves. Additionally, Tether has made efforts to bolster its USD reserves. According to the Q1 attestation conducted by financial services firm, BDO Italia, Tether possessed approximately $2.44 billion in excess reserves. Although the token has de-pegged from the USD more than 3 times in the past year, it has always rebounded. Tradecurve (TCRV) Presale Run Skyrockets With $3M Raise in Presale Tradecurve, a trading platform that has generated significant attention, has raised $4 million during its presale so far. The team anticipates raising a total of $20 million by Q3. Meanwhile, Tradecurve adopts a hybrid approach, blending elements of CEXs and DEXs, to establish a private trading environment. Safety is particularly crucial in the present era of data breaches, especially for traders who prioritize privacy. Unfortunately, many traditional trading exchanges have yet to implement a Proof of Reserves (PoR) system, causing diminishing trust from traders. Interestingly, Tradecurve is out to fill this void, enhance user trust and promote the exchange's integrity by implementing PoR. Tradecurve (TCRV) To Hit $0.025 in Stage 5 Tradecurve's TCRV token has captured significant attention in the crypto community. Over the past month, Tradecurve's price has skyrocketed by 150%, with the token surging from $0.015 to $0.025. What sets Tradecurve apart from rivals like Huobi and Coinbase is its emphasis on decentralization, user anonymity, and privacy. Moreover, Tradecurve ensures that traders enjoy a smooth trading experience by providing quick withdrawals, deposits, and trade execution. At present, the token is in stage five of its presale, enabling investors to acquire it for $0.025 per token. Analysts predict that with the current bullish trend, the token could reach $0.029 in stage 6. How High Can Tradecurve Go? While the forthcoming 40% surge appears like a remarkable price jump, it doesn’t compare with the long-term prediction for Tradecurve. Experts have predicted that the launch of the platform will attract a wave of traders to Tradecurve. This spike in activity is expected to cause a 50xsurge for Tradecurve in 2023 for TCRV to trade as high as $1 per token.

15522356,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=545294,1690895443,Uniswap (UNI) Stays Afloat With 12% Gain As Rest Of Top 50 Coins Sink,"Uniswap (UNI) has experienced a remarkable, bullish surge in its price amidst mounting sell-pressure on cryptocurrency exchanges. Bullish crypto traders have actively placed orders to buy 1.3 million UNI tokens, driving the price to $6.43, one of the highest levels in the past four months. CoinGecko data indicates that the token experienced a minor 0.07% drop in the past 24 hours but a notable seven-day rally of 12.4%. Recent data compiled by Santiment also reveals a noteworthy and sudden surge in Uniswap’s Age Consumed, indicating significant movement of tokens in the last few days. Source: Coingecko UNI Age Consumed: Understanding On-Chain Data With the UNI token price soaring to a remarkable four-month peak, investors are now contemplating the opportune moment to secure profits. The rapid surge in value has led some market participants to consider early profit-taking strategies. Investors and analysts closely examine on-chain data to understand better the market sentiment and the possibility of imminent sell-offs, focusing on a critical metric known as “Age Consumed.” Source: Santiment Age Consumed represents the total number of days since each token unit was last moved. It provides valuable insights into the activity of long-term holders and short-term traders. A significant increase in Age Consumed indicates that tokens previously held for an extended period are now being moved, potentially suggesting profit-taking or a shift in investor sentiment. In the case of UNI, the Age Consumed skyrocketed from 11.66 million on July 22 to 292.71 million by the end of July 30. Such a surge in Age Consumed suggests a notable movement of previously dormant UNI tokens, raising questions about the intentions of long-term holders and the potential impact on the token’s price. Uniswap Gains Preference After Curve Finance Exploit The bullish sentiment around Uniswap has been further fueled by a significant exploit that impacted another cryptocurrency token, the Curve Stablecoin Pools (CRV) token. The exploit led to a steep 20% plunge in the price of CRV, causing traders to pivot towards Uniswap’s UNI token. Uniswap market cap at $3.7 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Meanwhile, Uniswap’s UNI perpetual futures are now trading at a 20% premium, indicating that traders strongly believe in Uniswap’s potential to gain more market share in the aftermath of the CRV exploit. Moreover, the funding rates for UNI perpetual futures have surged to 19%, showcasing the optimistic sentiment among traders regarding the future performance of the UNI token. The aftermath of the Curve Finance exploit has had varying impacts on different DeFi platforms. While Curve Finance’s total value locked (TVL) dropped significantly from $3.2 billion to $1.8 billion, Uniswap’s TVL remained steady at around $3.8 billion. This stability in TVL demonstrates Uniswap’s resilience and strong fundamentals even during market turbulence. (This site’s content should not be construed as investment advice.

This move marks one of the initial full permits granted by Dubai since its revamp of the digital asset regulatory framework. Laser Digital, with its roots in Nomura, is poised to make a significant impact in the crypto space. The newly acquired licence empowers the firm to offer Virtual Asset Broker-Dealer Services and Virtual Asset Management and Investment Services. As reported by Bloomberg and Reuters, Laser Digital is gearing up to introduce over-the-counter (OTC) trading services and a diverse array of digital asset investment products tailored for institutional investors. The inception of Laser Digital can be traced back to last year, a venture co-founded by Steven Ashley, former leader of Nomura's wholesale division, and Jez Mohideen, who once held the roles of Nomura’s Chief Digital Officer and Co-Head of Global Markets EMEA. With headquarters in Switzerland and other offices in Dubai and London, Laser Digital blends the best practices of global investment banking with the expertise of a team deeply rooted in the crypto domain. Jez Mohideen, the driving force behind Laser Digital, expressed his gratitude towards the Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA) for the licence approval. “We are very grateful to VARA for approving our Operating Licence. VARA’s thorough and consultative process provides institutional investors with the assurance they require to engage in this asset class. With the licence now in place, we are looking forward to Laser’s growth over the coming years.” Slow but sure global adoption Perhaps it is still happening quite slowly, but the world contenders to become the main hub for the global crypto market appear to be getting their regulatory ducks in a line and are starting to attract the kind of institutional firms, such as Nomura, that will take the crypto sector forward into the next stage of adoption. Dubai is likely to have some heavy competition from its fellow Asian jurisdictions of Hong Kong and Singapore, while in Europe, the UK, France and others are looking to become crypto hubs. However, in the US, the regulatory environment is still sluggish and anything but clear. A move en masse out of this jurisdiction could still happen.

42419861,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUG7sD,1690894739,Ether Options Market Shows Bias for Price Weakness Over Next 6 Months,"Ethereum's native token Ether (ETH) fell to a six-week low on Tuesday, with traders in the options market betting on price weakness over the next six months.  The second-largest cryptocurrency by market value fell to $1,815 during Asian hours, reaching the lowest since June 21, according to CoinDesk data.  Ether's six-month call-put skew, which gauges the spread between implied volatilities for call and put options expiring in 180 days, slipped to -0.91, the lowest since June 15, according to crypto data provider Amberdata.  The negative value shows bias for put options, which give the purchaser the right but not the obligation to sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A put buyer is implicitly bearish on the market, while a call buyer is bullish.  The bearish skew comes as U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) looks to categorize most cryptocurrencies except bitcoin as securities, subjecting them to stringent oversight.  Per Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at crypto services provider Matrixport, ether's price appears vastly overvalued compared to its dwindling revenues.  According to data tracked by Matrixport, Ethereum's average monthly revenue now stands at $178 million, or 364% lower than the $826 million figure seen during the bull market days of 2021. Further, staking or locking coins in the Ethereum network in return for rewards is less rewarding than a few months ago. That's because the average staking yield of 4.98% is now less than the benchmark U.S. interest rate of 5.25%-5.5%.  ""Based on one quantitative approach, Ether's fair value appears closer to $1,000 or 46% lower than current prices ($1,856). While we do not necessarily predict such a decline, there is a zero-cost way to position for this decline (zero-cost, but not zero-risk),"" Thielen wrote in an email.  The so-called zero-risk strategy involves buying a December expiry at-the-money (ATM) ether put and financing it by selling an ATM bitcoin December expiry call. Options closer to the going market rate of the underlying asset are said to be at-the-money.  ""An at-the-money put for the December 2023 expiry put appears to trade at the same implied volatility for ether as for bitcoin (both near 42%), while historically, ether's implied vol has only on brief occasions dropped below bitcoin’s,"" Thielen noted. ""Buying a put on ether and financing it by selling one on bitcoin appears to be a zero-cost (but not zero-risk) strategy. It makes sense when Ether appears overvalued based on revenue-generating capabilities.""",NEGATIVE,ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/08/01/ether-options-market-shows-bias-for-price-weakness-over-6-months,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6db83b7fb35cfb4a6233d47527ecfeb23fad1ee8-2245x1263.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42419867,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUG7wL,1690892722,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Starts August in the Red After Losing Ground in July,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin (BTC) starts August losing ground, declining 2% Tuesday morning to add to July’s 4% retreat. The price dropped to as low as $28,800, its weakest level since mid-June, while altcoins took a larger hit with Solana’s SOL falling 5%, Optimism’s OP 8% and Stellar XLM 6%. The broad CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) is off 1.9%. In traditional markets, U.S. stock futures retreated slightly from 16-month highs as caution prevailed after a five-month winning streak. The pull back came after a number of companies reported disappointing second quarter earnings.  Justin Sun, the founder of the Tron blockchain, stepped in to support the Curve Finance (CRV) token price in a move that could protect a massive loan tied to the decentralized exchange’s founder Michael Egorov from being liquidated. Blockchain data from Tuesday shows Sun purchased about 5 million CRV from a wallet tagged “Curve.fi Founder” at an average price of $0.40 (just over $2.3 million) in an over-the-counter transaction. While Sun paid well below curve’s $0.59 trading price at writing time on Tuesday, it is more than the $0.37 price level at which Egarov’s loan could be liquidated. Curve Finance, a stablecoin swapping giant, suffered a Sunday exploit that drove down the price of the CRV token, putting $168 million of Egorov's holdings at risk of being liquidated.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued internet marketer Richard Schueler, known online as Richard Heart, and his projects Hex, PulseChain and PulseX, alleging he raised over $1 billion across three different unregistered securities offerings. Heart also defrauded his investors, the SEC alleged in its Monday lawsuit, by using investor funds for personal goods. ""Heart continually touted these investments as a pathway to grandiose wealth for investors, claiming that Hex, for example, 'was built to be the highest appreciating asset that has ever existed in the history of man,'"" the lawsuit read. ""Although Heart claimed these investments were for the vague purpose of supporting free speech, he did not disclose that he used millions of dollars of PulseChain investor funds to buy luxury goods for himself.""  Chart of the Day  The chart shows 1% market depth for decentralized exchange Curve's CRV token in U.S. dollar terms and native token terms.  The market depth – the market's ability to absorb large orders at stable prices – has declined in the dollar terms and is only slightly up in the native token terms.  A potential liquidation of Curve founder Micheal Egorov's multi-million dollar worth of CRV backed loans could thus have an outsized impact of CRV's price.

The token's developer withdrew a substantial sum of 6,800 ETH ($12.5 million) from the liquidity pool on LeetSwap. This sudden move raised eyebrows and further added to the challenges faced by Base's leading DEX. Base and Coinbase's Regulatory Woes Base, as an Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) chain, empowers developers to build decentralized apps using Coinbase's products, users, and tools. However, Coinbase has been dealing with its own regulatory challenges after falling in the crosshairs of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The latter has demanded Coinbase suspend all cryptocurrency trading except for Bitcoin, and upon questioning the decision, the regulatory body filed a lawsuit against the exchange. SEC’s Lawsuit Against Coinbase According to the lawsuit filed by the SEC, the regulatory body deemed 13 assets on Coinbase, including Solana (SOL), Polygon (MATIC), Cardano (ADA), FIL, SAND, AXS, ICP, NEAR, CHZ, DASH, VGX, and NEXO, as securities. The SEC also accused Coinbase of failing to register as a broker, clearing agency, or national securities exchange, indicating that the exchange was not adhering to the established disclosure regime for the U.S. securities markets. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong stated that the exchange had limited choices in dealing with the SEC's demands. Following the regulator's instructions would have set a dangerous precedent and conveyed the wrong message. Therefore, it found itself caught between compliance and potential harm to the cryptocurrency industry's principles. Issues Pile Up For Coinbase LeetSwap's trading halt and the exploits on Base's liquidity pairs have raised serious concerns about security vulnerabilities on the Coinbase-backed blockchain. Additionally, Bald's dramatic crash and Coinbase's ongoing legal battle with the SEC have further complicated matters for the platform. The situation highlights the challenges and uncertainties surrounding the crypto industry's regulatory landscape and emphasizes the need for continued vigilance and security measures to protect investors and users alike.

SEC Charges Richard Heart, Hex, PulseChain, and PulseX In a press release, the SEC announced it charged Richard Heart and three unincorporated entities under his control with conducting unregistered offerings of crypto asset securities that raised over $1 billion in crypto assets from investors. The entities controlled by Heart are Hex, PulseX, and PulseChain. The agency further charged Heart and PulseChain with fraud, alleging they misappropriated at least $12 million in the offering proceeds to purchase luxury goods, including a 555-carat black diamond called “The Enigma.” According to the SEC’s press release: “Heart began marketing Hex in 2018, claiming it was the first high-yield “blockchain certificate of deposit,” and began promoting Hex tokens as an investment designed to make people “rich.” The agency also claims: “From at least December 2019 through November 2020, Heart and Hex allegedly offered and sold Hex tokens in an unregistered offering, collecting more than 2.3 million Ethereum (ETH), including through so-called “recycling” transactions that enabled Heart to surreptitiously gain control of more Hex tokens.” According to the SEC, Heart also created and marketed a so-called “staking” feature for Hex tokens in which he claimed he could deliver returns as high as 38%. The SEC also takes issue with Heart’s attempt to evade securities laws by asking investors to “sacrifice” instead of “invest” their assets in exchange for PLS and PLSX tokens. Eric Werner, Director of the Forth Worth Regional Office, commented: “Heart called on investors to buy crypto asset securities in offerings that he failed to register. He then defrauded those investors by spending some of their crypto assets on exorbitant luxury goods.” He added the SEC’s actions against the founder seek to protect the “investing public and hold Heart accountable for his actions.” The SEC filed its lawsuit in the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The agency said Heart claimed Hex “was built to be the highest appreciating asset that has ever existed in the history of man.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

42419841,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUG7cj,1690887309,Crisis at DeFi Giant Curve Eases After Justin Sun and Others Step In With Help,"Justin Sun, the founder of the Tron blockchain, stepped in to protect against a possible bad debt situation stemming from falling curve (CRV) token prices that could impact a massive loan tied to Curve Finance founder Michael Egorov.  Blockchain data from Tuesday shows Sun purchased about 5 million CRV from a wallet tagged “Curve.fi Founder” at an average price of $0.4 in an over-the-counter transaction. This amounts to just over $2.3 million. While Sun paid well below curve’s $0.59 trading price at writing time on Tuesday, it is more than the $0.37 price level at which Egarov’s loan could be liquidated.  “Excited to assist Curve!,” Sun tweeted Tuesday. “As steadfast partners, we remain committed to providing support whenever needed.”  Read more: Curve Founder’s $168M Stash Is Under Stress, Creating a Risk for DeFi as a Whole  “Our joint efforts will introduce an @stusdt pool on Curve, amplifying user benefits. Together, we aim to empower the community and forge decentralized finance,” Sun added. stUSDT is described as the “first real-world asset protocol on the Tron Network.”  Blockchain data shows several other DeFi players stepped in to pick up discounted crv tokens via OTC trading shortly after Sun's purchases. Crypto investor Jeffrey Huang, known online as Machi Big Brother, bought 3.75 million tokens, while crypto fund DWF Labs and DeFi protocol bought 2.5M curve each.  Egorov sold a total of 39.25 million crv tokens via OTC and received $15.8 million as of European noon hours on Tuesday.  Curve Finance, a stablecoin swapping giant, suffered a Sunday exploit that drove down the price of the CRV token, putting a $168 million stash of Egorov's money at risk of being liquidated. This created bearish sentiment for the tokens among traders alongside concerns that liquidated assets would have to be sold into a market where prices are already falling.  The liquidation of such a large position could have put pressure on other DeFi protocols because CRV is used as a trading pair and ballast in trading pools across the ecosystem.  But wealthy participants like Sun are stepping up to community acclaim, and to possibly protect their own outsized token holdings from being hit.",POSITIVE,CRV,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | CRV | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/08/01/tron-founder-justin-sun-alleviates-curve-finances-looming-bad-debt-situation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2dee615715bcf7e043922f7a5f98cf3224106ff6-1353x761.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Litecoin's halving cycle and limited supply cap make it interesting for long-term fundamental crypto investors. HODLers control more than half of the LTC supply as the coin becomes the top payment crypto on BitPay. In the last couple years, I haven't exactly hid my optimism for Litecoin (LTC-USD) generally speaking. Through Seeking Alpha, I've covered the silver to Bitcoin's (BTC-USD) gold three times: With Active Wallet Addresses Moving Higher, Don't Overlook Litecoin (Oct 2021) Crypto Contrarian: The Market Hates Litecoin, It Shouldn't (Oct 2022) Crypto Recession Strategy: Staking Litecoin (May 2023) To sum up the general thesis that ties all of those pieces together, LTC remains one of the most utilized crypto coins for payments in the market. Despite the clear utility of the coin, there is a general disinterest among most crypto investors and pundits. For me, this makes Litecoin quite interesting for a long term, fundamental crypto investor. Like Bitcoin, Litecoin uses a proof-of-work consensus mechanism and has a limited supply cap. Also like Bitcoin, Litecoin has a halving cycle. On August 2nd, 2023, Litecoin issuance will drop from 12.5 LTC per block to 6.25 LTC per block. In this article, we'll update some of the standard usage metrics and valuation metrics for LTC. We'll also explore Litecoin's historical performance following halving cycles to assess whether or not crypto investors should buy or sell this cycle's halving. Network Metrics Back in May when the Ordinals/BRC-20 boom put pressure on Bitcoin transaction fees, Litecoin was a major beneficiary of that fee spike. For a brief period, there were actually more daily active users of the Litecoin network than there were of the Bitcoin network as high cost transactions pushed users to look elsewhere for smaller value transfers: DAU trend YTD (Coin Metrics) On May 8th, there were 810k active addresses on the Litecoin network. This was slightly above the 772k active addresses on the Bitcoin network on the same day. The biggest reason for this usage spike was the fact that Litecoin network transactions were so cheap by comparison: Median Tx Fee (Coin Metrics) Even as the Bitcoin network fees spiked near $20 per transaction in early May, Litecoin's fees by comparison remained less than a penny per transaction. This is where Litecoin is very attractive as a peer to peer payment coin. In times of high network congestion on Bitcoin, Litecoin has a user experience advantage on-chain over something like the Lightning Network and we can see indications of this in the data. Lightning Capacity (LookIntoBitcoin) While Ordinals was wreaking havoc on network fee affordability, crypto users opted for Litecoin while Lighting Network channel growth was minimal. In fact, the network capacity on Lightning has actually been negative since the regional banking crisis in March. At the start of the year, there was roughly 5,173 BTC spending capacity on Lightning Network. Today that figure is down to 4,711. Share of transactions (BitPay) Looking at third party crypto payment data also offers interesting insight into the growing trend of Litecoin usage. In February, BTC accounted for 45% of payment transaction count through the BitPay service while LTC came in at 23.7%. In June, LTC flipped BTC on BitPay and now holds a slight 35% to 34% edge in share of BitPay transactions. Past Halvings For Bitcoin, the post-halving performance is somewhat straight forward. Generally speaking, Bitcoin's price has made a new all time high 12-18 months following a block reward halving event. For Litecoin, the long term performance is much less straight forward. Litecoin Halving August 25th, 2015 August 5th, 2019 Halving day close price $2.97 $96.56 1 month -2.7% -32.4% 6 Month 13.5% -24.8% 1 Year 27.6% -39.0% Source: TradingView, Binance pricing There have been just two halving events in the past for Litecoin and following both instances the price of LTC was lower one month later. The 2015 halving did result in positive price performance 6 months and 12 months after the fact. However, the 2019 halving appears to have been a sell the news event. LTC prices were lower by a much larger margin a month after the halving and prices were actually worse a year later. Also interesting is the current price of LTC as of article submission is actually still behind the price of LTC on the day of the 2019 halving. But there are other things to consider. For instance, wallet address growth since the last halving cycle is definitely in the smaller cohorts: Wallet Holdings 0.1 - 1 LTC 1 - 10 LTC 10 - 100 LTC 100 - 1k LTC August 25th, 2015 57,784 64,918 48,070 15,299 August 5th, 2019 407,762 484,204 235,295 35,139 July 31st, 2023 783,038 620,324 205,633 32,696 Change From 1st to 2nd 605.7% 645.9% 389.5% 129.7% Change From 2nd to Now 92.0% 28.1% -12.6% -7.0% Source: IntoTheBlock What I'm showing in the table above can be interpreted two different ways. On one hand, the growth in smaller wallet holders from 1st halving to second halving was significantly more robust at over 600% for wallet addresses holding between 0.1 LTC and 10 LTC. Furthermore, the growth in wallet addresses with 10 LTC to 1k LTC has actually been negative since the second halving. On the surface, this could be viewed as a lack of holder growth but that's not actually true. HODLer Balance Over Time (IntoTheBlock) Total LTC holders nearly tripled to 8.9 million total addresses from 3.1 million at the last halving. But more importantly for the supply/demand mechanism of the halving this time around is the amount of supply held by ""hodlers"" rather than ""traders"" or ""cruisers."" According to IntoTheBlock data, at the last halving, hodlers controlled roughly 35% of the LTC supply. That figure is now over 56%. In my view, the hodler supply setup is currently far more similar to what it was in summer 2020 before LTC rallied from $45 to $335 12 months later. Valuation A metric that I've tried to use as a valuation multiple for payment-cryptos in the past is the NVT ratio, or the net value to transaction ratio. What this ratio does is examine the USD-denominated value transacted over a blockchain network against the market capitalization of the native asset of that blockchain to determine if the coin's value is too high or too low. What helps smooth out the data over a longer period of time is looking at the NVT ratio through a 90 day moving average: 90 Day MA NVT Ratio (Coin Metrics) In the chart above, I'm showing the 90 day moving average NVT ratios for Bitcoin, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash ( BCH-USD ), and Dash ( DASH-USD ). At 64, LTC is by far the lowest 90 day NVT of the four mentioned coins and the each of the other 3 are above 100. This means compared to peers, LTC is undervalued given the usage of the network. Risks Litecoin has failed to keep up with the long term performance of Bitcoin. The LTC/BTC ratio has continued to make new lows through the years. Data by YCharts As an investment, it's difficult to argue that LTC is the better play than simply buying BTC. However, fundamentals and valuations matter. And I think there is a compelling case to be made for LTC even after a 200% increase from what I believe was the cycle bottom in June 2022. But there are still regulatory concerns to consider, though I view PoW coins like LTC to be much safer than PoS coins or ICO tokens. Summary Past performance is not an indicator of future results. Market participants learn this time and again in the financial markets. Litecoin's halving history is mixed. So it's difficult to say definitively where LTC will be a month, 6 months, or a year from now. For me, the better indicator for LTC is to look at the usage metrics, hodler supply, and valuation metrics. Each of which may indicate LTC's rally from the cycle low last summer could be just getting started. Litecoin has been viewed by some as the silver to Bitcoin's gold. I personally like this comparison and I think the usage data from May 2023 is a very interesting tell. When it became too expensive to use the Bitcoin network for smaller transactions, crypto users turned to Litecoin. Some, myself included, have argued the Bitcoin network needs transaction fees to be a larger portion of the block reward in the future to adequately incentivize miners. If that happens, those who are unwilling to use second layer options like Lightning may once again turn to Litecoin. And now the mine supply of LTC is cut in half with hodlers controlling the majority of the supply. I maintain LTC is a buy.",POSITIVE,BCH | LTC,BCH | BUSINESS | LTC | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4622079-litecoin-buy-or-sell-the-halving?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/15519077.jpeg

15517696,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/08/bitcoin-repeating-phase-1-of-the-bull-all-is-well,1690884072,Bitcoin repeating phase 1 of the bull - all is well,"The Bitcoin bull market is just going through the same 3 steps it has taken in its previous bull markets. Seasoned trader Steve Courtney of CryptoCrewUniversity has been repeating his mantra for a good while now that Bitcoin is doing what it does every bull market, and that thus far it is following the pattern which puts it in stage one of the bull market. Courtney points out that right now Bitcoin is holding above the 200-week moving average and therefore even if it comes down to test it, which would take it down to around $27,000, all would be perfectly fine as long as this huge last line in the sand holds fast. The trader’s next area to keep an eye on is the relative strength indicator (RSI) where Bitcoin needs to continue building a base structure above the mid level. Here, on the weekly time frame, support can be found at the 51 level. Courtney has the view that this is all-important, and should Bitcoin fall below and make this resistance, a lot of trouble could be heading Bitcoin’s way. The Stochastic RSI, which measures momentum is Courtney’s next port of call. The veteran trader points out that every 6 months there is a cross on the Stochastic RSI and remarks that each one of these crosses heralds the biggest moves for Bitcoin. For the previous cross, Bitcoin rallied from about $25,000 up to just under $32,000, from which it has fallen to its current level of around $29,000. For the 3 steps, Courtney states that step number 1 is triggered by the Pi Cycle. A cross up for this indicator always leads to a huge rally which is then met by resistance that is not broken for quite some period of time. However, this part of the bull market may not be plain sailing. Courtney says that if price does not hold above the red line, it will always fall to the green, quite a drop in price, leading to an extended phase 1, but which would still mean that Bitcoin stays in its bull market unless falling below the green line. For his second step Courtney uses the Dynamic Traders Index which tells him when Bitcoin moves into phase 2 of the bull market. He remarks that this indicator is not showing that we are near phase 2 of the bull yet. For Courtney, phase 2 is when price holds support above the resistance at $30,000 (phase 1) and then consolidates for many months. A breakout and consolidation above this would lead to stage 3 and big increases in price action until the top of this particular bull market is reached. Due to reducing gains in each successive bull market, Courtney is of the opinion that Bitcoin probably won’t reach $100,000, which runs contrary to the view of most other analysts. Time will prove him right or wrong. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

42419865,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUG7vJ,1690883602,Curve Founder Deploys New Liquidity Pool to Address FRAX Debt Situation,"Egorov has created a new liquidity pool on Curve for FraxLend's CRV/FRAX market, called crvUSD/fFRAX.  Such a step could alleviate concerns forming around a possible bad debt situation which has added bearish sentiment to CRV tokens.  Curve founder Michael Egorov has floated a new liquidity pool on his stablecoin-focused decentralized exchange intended to buy time to repay his highly-publicized and potentially market-threatening curve token (CRV)-collateralized borrowing from stablecoin issuer FraxLend.  The new pool, crvUSD/fFRAX seeded with 100,000 in CRV rewards, is dedicated to FraxLend's CRV/FRAX Liquidity pool, from which Egorov has borrowed 15.8 million FRAX stablecoin by locking 59 million CRV as collateral. Markets have feared the liquidation of the FRAX loan and Egorov's CRV-backed loan of 63.2 million tether (USDT) from leading and borrowing marketplace Aave ever since late Sunday's Curve exploit sent CRV tanking.  The FRAX loan has been of particular concern, as under the FraxLend rules, interest rates (annualized percentage yield or APY) on borrowing can double every 12 hours, subject to the pool's utilization rate holding at 100%. The utilization rate refers to the ratio of the amount of assets borrowed to the total liquidity in the pool.  In other words, the interest rate can become astronomical unless more liquidity flows into the pool, bringing the utilization rate lower, as tweeted by crypto research firm Delphi Digital. In that case, the astronomical interest rate alone could trigger the liquidation of Egorov's FRAX loan, putting additional pressure on the CRV token and increasing the risk of liquidation on the bigger Aave loan.  Egorov has floated the new pool to attract more liquidity and reduce the utilization rate, per pseudonymous DeFi researcher Ignas.  ""He borrowed FRAX using CRV as collateral on FraxLend. However, because people are withdrawing FRAX from the pool, fearing bad debt in the event of CRV liquidation, the APY has significantly increased,"" Ignas explained. ""He now needs more FRAX deposited to that CRV/FRAX lending pool. That's why the introduction of a new pool on Curve.""  Ignas added that the new pool, equipped with CRV incentives, is attracting capital to the critical FRAX/CRV lending pool on Fraxlend, reducing the borrowing APY and ""providing him with more time to repay the loan.""  Delphi Digital said in a Tweet thread that the new pool is an ""attempt to incentivize liquidity towards the lending market in order to lower utilization rates and decrease the risk of his debt spiraling out of control.""  So far, the pool, floated late Monday, has attracted over $5 million in liquidity and brought down the utilization rate in FraxLend's FRAX/CRV pool to 54.78%.",NEGATIVE,CRV | USDT,CRV | EXCHANGE | MARKET | USDT | RESEARCH,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/08/01/curve-founder-deploys-new-liquidity-pool-to-address-frax-debt-situation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a797c1e1f11a8979c6c8f17c76f01cafba58b976-3137x1398.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

15517219,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=545287,1690882773,Dogecoin vs Bitcoin: Key Differences and Similarities,"What is Dogecoin? Dogecoin is an alternative coin — more commonly known as an Altcoin — that was established by co-founders Jackson Palmer and Billy Markus in 2013. It was initially created as a joke — based on the well-known “Doge” meme. Each coin has its own blockchain infrastructure and operating system. Dogecoin runs on the same blockchain infrastructure and uses similar proof-of-work operating systems — a mathematical security system used to verify transactions and approve task execution — as Litecoin and Ethereum, with small modifications. How is Dogecoin different from Bitcoin? Bitcoin and dogecoin are extremely different cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is a widely-used, reputable coin that acts as legal tender in many countries across the world, as well as in transnational markets and industries. Dogecoin lacks the legitimacy and global infrastructure to reach the heights of Bitcoin. They also differ drastically in market share. With Bitcoin, there’s a finite number of coins available, creating a limited supply. Dogecoin has an endless supply of tokens, meaning supply can never outpace demand, leaving it in a permanently deflationary state. Both Dogecoin and Bitcoin also run on different blockchain networks — and different advancements in blockchain technologies are one of the determining factors of market fluctuations. Bitcoin runs on its own blockchain network, whereas Dogecoin piggybacks off the Ethereum blockchain, but with its own slight changes to transaction tracking and payment recording. Is Dogecoin better than Bitcoin? Deciding which cryptocurrency is better will ultimately come down to what a user is looking for from their coin. If users are looking for transaction speeds and lower fees, Dogecoin is superior due to the Ethereum-based blockchain, being designed specifically for rapid, seamless transactions. However, if it’s accessibility, usability and value that users are looking for, Bitcoin outperforms Dogecoin because it’s more widely-used and available — meaning users have more options when it comes to making and receiving payments. From an investment standpoint, Bitcoin stands head and shoulders above Dogecoin. While Dogecoin is struggling to reach 1 cent in value, Bitcoin fluctuates on average between 27-30 thousand dollars per coin. While Bitcoin’s value is based on quantifiable aspects — like its widespread usage, user popularity and limited circulation — Dogecoin doesn’t have too much room for growth given its endless supply and low user uptake. Dogecoin vs Bitcoin price The difference between the current and historical price fluctuations of the two coins couldn’t be more different. At the height of its reign, Dogecoin peaked at 74 cents, having opened on the market at 0.017 cents per coin — meaning its value went up by over 9000% during the cryptocurrency boom. In that same period, Bitcoin had a meteoric rise — peaking at over $61k and opening at $327 — growing at a percentage rate of over nine million percent from opening. Both coins have historically reached dizzying heights — allowing those traders who were hot on the trends to see staggering profits. However, the popularity, accessibility and user uptake of Bitcoin means it’s the more valuable coin by a wide margin. Dogecoin mining vs Bitcoin mining “Crypto mining” is a common way for users to get hold of valuable coins. The process of mining involves using powerful computers and high-speed internet connectivity to automatically solve a series of complex puzzles and algorithms to validate transactions and secure small portions of coins. With enough portions, miners begin to accrue enough value to make the long process of mining worthwhile. Despite the popularity of Bitcoin, it’s much more time-consuming to mine than its Dogecoin counterpart. Bitcoin miners typically take around ten minutes to approve transaction blocks, whereas Dogecoin miners can approve them ten times faster, with a block every minute. Because Dogecoin runs on an adaptation of the Ethereum blockchain — which can be mined at a rate of 13 million blocks for every 700,000 Bitcoin blocks — it’s significantly easier to mine. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Can Dogecoin grow like Bitcoin? It’s extremely unlikely that Dogecoin will ever reach the value of Bitcoin for three key reasons. The primary reason is popularity. Because of Bitcoin’s widespread usage and popularity, it’s infinitely more sought-after than Dogecoin. Secondly, the circulation of Dogecoins doesn’t allow it to grow in the same way Bitcoin did. There is an unlimited number of Dogecoins, meaning the number will always be higher than demand. There is only a finite number of Bitcoins in circulation — meaning that demand will likely always outstrip supply, increasing its value. Comparatively speaking, Dogecoin is an inflationary coin and Bitcoin is a deflationary coin, meaning Dogecoin can never grow in the same way. Lastly, many reputable investors believe that the primary “crypto booms” are over. Only the longstanding, widely used coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum will see substantial gains whereas meme tokens like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu will never see these highs again in the eyes of many reputable traders. Is Dogecoin still a good investment? Despite it being a meme coin that is taken less seriously than other big players, many investors still hold Dogecoin in their portfolios. Because you can buy a significant number of Dogecoins for incredibly low prices, even minor fluctuations can land quick profits. However, the risk of another cryptocurrency crash — and the volatile nature of crypto in general — means that most investors will only hold a small percentage of the coin in their portfolio to mitigate against risks like the crypto crash of 2018. What is the disadvantage of Dogecoin? Despite it being a well-known cryptocurrency, Dogecoin has its disadvantages — both as a cryptocurrency and an investment. Some of the disadvantages to consider when investing in Dogecoin include: Lack of utility — Despite being the tenth-highest cryptocurrency in terms of value, it has almost no real-world utility. Because its value is entirely based on speculation and hype derived almost entirely from its meme background, Dogecoin is inherently unstable. It also lacks the real-world use and user uptake of larger, more practical coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum. No supply cap – Because the supply of Dogecoin is endless, it can never outpace demand — ultimately limiting its potential for growth. Little supporting metrics — It historically has not been a big grower. Despite booming significantly during the crypto boom of 2017, it never exceeded a value of more than 61 cents per coin — making it an incredibly low-value asset, even at the height of its power. Is Dogecoin a good long-term investment? Unfortunately, without a significant shift in either how it functions as a cryptocurrency, market shifts or investor interest, it’s unlikely investors will see long-term gains on the asset. Like all cryptocurrencies, it can act as a strong diversifier for short-term gains — given the volatile nature of the crypto market. However, its potential for long-term gains compared to established coins and tokens like Ethereum, Bitcoin and Solana, is slim.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | DOGE | ETH | MARKET,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/learn/dogecoin-vs-bitcoin/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

Curve founder Michael Egorov has a loan of around $70 million in USDT on Aave v2, using CRV as collateral. Curve Chaos Could Have Major Implications The exploit at Curve Finance resulted in the price of the protocol’s CRV token experiencing a sharp decline. This decline has put a $168 million lending position held by Curve founder Michael Egorov at risk of liquidation. If the position gets liquidated, it could have disastrous implications across the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. The Curve founder has around $168 million worth of CRV, which he has used to secure loans from several DeFi protocols, according to data from the blockchain analytics site DeBank. This amount equals nearly 34% of CRV’s total market capitalization. The exploit has led to a decline of over 20% in the CRV price, putting Egorov’s position in danger of liquidation. A Major Blow A forced liquidation would be a devastating blow to Curve after its weekend exploit. As a result of the exploit, the total value of assets locked on the DeFi protocol dropped from $3.7 billion to $2.1 billion, with investors pulling their funds as a precaution. Thanks to DeFi’s interconnected nature, the liquidation of Egorov’s position could put significant pressure on CRV’s price and other decentralized lending protocols. The CRV token is extremely popular on Uniswap and Sushiswap and is used as collateral on platforms such as Aave. Aave’s Exposure Michael Egorov has a $70 million loan in USDT on Aave v2, for which he has used CRV as collateral. Based on risk parameters set by Aave, if the CRV token’s price drops below $65%, it would be at risk of liquidation. When liquidations occur, the collateral the borrower deposits is sold in exchange for the borrowed asset. In the case of Aave, the CRV would be sold for Aave, leading to considerable bad debt. The concerns around bad debt were already flagged by Gauntlet, who recommended freezing CRV and setting its loan-to-value to zero on Aave v2. “The amount of CRV concentrated on Aave, relative to the circulating supply of CRV, is already high. Given the limitations of V2 mechanisms, including the possibility of circumventing an LTV of 0, the only way to truly prevent more risk of this position is to prevent borrowing of all assets on V2.” However, this proposal failed to pass. Aave’s GHO stablecoin also lost its peg for a few hours on the 31st of July. The stablecoin subsequently regained its peg, with analysts working to determine why the de-pegging occurred. According to most, the de-pegging was a result of the reentrancy attack on Curve Finance. The GHO stablecoin had dropped to $0.96 on the 31st, losing its $1 peg for a few hours. However, it regained its peg and is currently trading at $0.98. Other Protocols At Risk Aave is not the only protocol that the Curve Finance fiasco could impact. Egorov has also borrowed $17 million worth of the FRAX stablecoin, putting $32 million worth of CRV as collateral. Since the exploit, Egorov has made several transactions to repay part of the amount he borrowed on Fraxlend. According to DeBank data, Egorov also has an $18 million loan on DeFi protocol Abracadabra. Egorov has moved to shore up his capital by selling LDO, the governance token for liquid staking protocol Lido, in exchange for the USDC stablecoin. These transactions have been done in several batches valued at between $10,000 and $50,000, according to data from EtherScan. The developments have raised several questions for decentralized lending protocols, and whether they should implement measures to prevent large positions, such as the ones taken by Egorov, that could potentially introduce systemic risk. Egorov came under fierce criticism in 2020 after he took control of over two-thirds of a Curve voting token, veCRV. He later apologized and called the move an overreaction to what he thought was a takeover attempt by Yearn.Finance. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

15514589,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=545269,1690875941,Ethereum DeFi Coins Plunge As Curve Concerns Threaten Major Market Crash,"The Ethereum DeFi space is currently experiencing a rough few hours. All major DeFi coins are posting deep red numbers in the last 24 hours: Compound (-18%), Aave (-10%), Curve (-10%), Frax (-6%), and Synthetix (-6%). The reason? Curve Finance, a flagship decentralized exchange specializing in stablecoin swaps, recently suffered a significant exploit. The resulting aftershocks are being felt across the DeFi ecosystem, inciting fears of a broader Ethereum DeFi massacre. The exploit, causing a damage of around $100 million, sets off potential domino effects threatening the stability of the wider DeFi landscape. Curve Hack Sparks Fears Of Ethereum DeFi Crash Delving into the details of the exploit reveals the intricate dynamics at play. The attackers took advantage of vulnerabilities in the Vyper smart contract software, leading to the significant losses on Curve Finance. The repercussions of this incident have been profound. The popular stablecoin DEX Curve Finance could be a ticking time bomb for the rest of the Ethereum DeFi sector. Related Reading: Here’s How Long The Majority Of New Ethereum Wallets Are Used Before They’re Dumped Post-incident, it is reported that over $45 million has been drained from liquidity pools of third-party providers, with an additional $25 million directly siphoned from the Curve Protocol’s CRV/ETH pool. The ensuing liquidity crisis and the impending risk of further sell-offs, given the millions of Curve (CRV) tokens still held by the attackers, is generating substantial anxiety within the market. The founder of Curve Finance, Michael Egorov, has not been immune to these significant losses. His large positions backed by CRV have come under intense pressure, pushing the platform to the brink. Delphi Digital explains, “Curve founder, Michael Egorov, currently has a ~$100 million loan backed by 427.5 million CRV (about 47% of the entire CRV circulating supply). With CRV down 10% over the past 24 hours, the health of Curve is in jeopardy.” Furthermore, Egorov holds large loans on Aave and Frax Finance, backed by CRV collateral. On Aave, he has a $305 million CRV backed loan amounting to 63.2 million USDT. At a liquidation threshold of 55%, his position could be liquidated if CRV/USDT hits $0.3767. As per Delphi Digital’s assessment, this would require a ~33% drop in the CRV price. Egorov also carries a ~4% APY for this loan. The situation on Frax Finance is even more precarious. Here, Egorov has supplied 59 million CRV against 15.8 million FRAX of debt. The high utilization and the Time-Weighted Variable Interest Rate, doubling every 12 hours, makes his position particularly vulnerable to astronomical interest rates and subsequent liquidation, irrespective of the CRV price. Delphi Digital emphasizes, “This astronomical interest rate could lead to his eventual liquidation, regardless of CRV price. At a max LTV of 75%, his position’s liquidation price could reach 0.517 CRV/FRAX within 4.5 days, less than a 10% decrease from current prices.” Related Reading: Ethereum Price Will Skyrocket Due To AI-Driven DAO Revolution: Arthur Hayes Today, Egorov deployed a new Curve pool and gauge: a 2 pool consisting of crvUSD & Fraxlend’s CRV/FRAX LP token, seeded with 100,000 of CRV rewards. However, with no success. Utilization was quickly back to 100% as illiquid CRV holders took Frax stables to exit, and Frax lenders bailed on risky pool. Thus, Egorov’s new pool is just spending more of his CRV and not bringing his interest rate down. As the market grapples with the mounting liquidation risk of Egorov’s positions, the potential market-wide repercussions are alarming. Autism Capital warns, “If Michael gets liquidated by Fraxlend, all of his other debt positions will be liquidated too. This likely means Inverse Finance (INV) and Magic Internet Money (MIM) will both die due to the new bad debt, and Aave will get stuck with $63 million of bad debt.” Moreover, a liquidation of Egorov will likely trigger cascades on-chain and nuke CRV to almost zero. Not All Hope Is Lost However, despite the ensuing chaos, the DeFi sector’s operations, strictly governed by code and math, remain unaffected. As Autism Capital rightly puts it, “In one sense, this is proof that DeFi works as intended. There are no special rules or bailouts, no matter who you are. It’s a brutal free market governed by math and code.” Moreover, there’s still hope for a happy-end. Assuming liquidity recovers, the DeFi sector might regain balance. The Curve team has indicated that several millions in US dollars are in possession of white-hat hackers. This could potentially enable the recovery of some of the misappropriated assets. Additionally, some bots intercepted a significant quantity of CRV tokens from the Curve attackers. Nevertheless, the threat of the situation spreading remains a serious concern. Platforms like Frax, Aave and others remain on high alert, while some, like Alchemix, have already halted their smart contracts. [UPDATE] It looks like Egorov got an OTC deal with a CEX, paying off his debt. This is the reason for CRV’s price rebound. About to drop to $13M loaned. The money is definitely coming from an OTC deal. It looks like a handshake deal. He’s selling his CRV at 0.4 🚨2.5M crv for 1M usdt clips Which one of you chads got the sick deal? I assume this will go until entire debt paid off. pic.twitter.com/3c5OmcQ7wH — Midas: Fool’s Gold (@MidasFoolsGold) August 1, 2023 [UPDATE #2] According to Lookonchain, Curve founder Michael Egorov sold 5 million CRV to Justin Sun via OTC transactions at a price of $0.4. In addition to Sun, there are 7 addresses that conducted OTC transactions with Michael Egorov for $0.4. 0xSifu, the former CFO of Frog Nation, said that he was also contacted for OTC trading and had a 6-month lock-up period. At press time, the Curve (CRV) price saw a slight recovery within the last three hours, rising to $0.57.

15514588,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/08/upbit-suspends-crv-transactions-following-curve-finance-exploit,1690875900,Upbit Suspends CRV Transactions Following Curve Finance Exploit,"Upbit, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in South Korea, has temporarily suspended CRV withdrawals and deposits after Curve fell victim to a significant exploit. Other exchanges have been keeping track of the situation but have not initiated any action as of now. The Curve Finance Exploit Curve Finance tweeted over the weekend that the protocol had fallen victim to an exploit. The protocol stated that over $100 million worth of cryptocurrency was at risk thanks to a reentrancy bug in Vyper, the programming language used to power parts of the larger Curve ecosystem. As a result, several stablecoin pools used in the pricing and liquidity of several DeFi projects were drained by hackers. “A number of stablepools (alETH/msETH/pETH) using Vyper 0.2.15 have been exploited as a result of a malfunctioning reentrancy lock. We are assessing the situation and will update the community as things develop.” In another tweet on Monday, the protocol listed out the hacked pools. It also stated that the Arbitrum trycrypto pool could also have been compromised during the hack. “As a result of an issue in Vyper compiler in versions 0.2.15-0.3.0, the following pools were hacked: crv/eth aleth/eth mseth/eth peth/eth Another pool potentially affected is arbitrum’s tricrypto. Auditors and Vyper devs could not find a profitable exploit, but please exit that one.” Re-entrancy attacks are a fairly common exploit, allowing hackers to trick smart contracts by making repeated calls to the protocol and stealing user assets. A call is basically an authorization for a smart contract address to interact with a user’s wallet address. Upbit Suspends CRV Withdrawals And Deposits Following the exploit, Upbit, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in South Korea, announced it was temporarily suspending the withdrawal and deposit of Curve Finance’s native CRV token. The suspension was announced by Chinese crypto reporter Wu Blockchain on Twitter, who stated, “South Korea’s largest exchange, Upbit, announced that due to the attack on some of Curve’s stablecoin pools, CRV volatility is high, and Curve (CRV) deposit and withdrawal services have been suspended.” The Upbit exchange, in its announcement, stated it had detected several vulnerabilities in some stablecoin pools associated with Curve Finance, leading to the CRV token experiencing considerable volatility. It added that it was temporarily suspending CRV deposits and withdrawals. “Today, certain vulnerabilities have been discovered in some of the stablecoin pools associated with Curve (CRV). As a result, CRV is currently experiencing significant volatility. We advise exercising caution when considering any investments related to CRV. To ensure the safety of digital asset transactions, we have temporarily suspended deposits and withdrawals for CRV.” The hack has resulted in a loss of over $100 million for the protocol, with the CRV token down over 12%. Other Exchanges Keeping Tabs While Upbit has swung into action and suspended CRV deposits and withdrawals, other prominent exchanges have adopted a wait-and-watch approach. Upbit has also urged users to exercise caution when considering any investments related to CRV. OKX, another prominent exchange, issued a warning for users on the token’s landing page, telling users the exchange would not be responsible for any losses incurred while trading the CRV token. Meanwhile, Binance head Changpeng Zhao stated that Binance users were unaffected by the exploit in Curve. “CEX price feed saves DeFi. Binance users are not affected. Our team checked on the Vyper Reentrant Vulnerability. We only use version 0.3.7 or above.” Zhao explained that Binance’s use of a centralized price feed for DeFi tokens adds an extra layer of security. Zhao also insisted on updating applications, code libraries, and operating systems. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

However, Igamberdiev stated that while the actions seemed to be ""definitely someone from Alameda,"" it was unlikely to be Bankman-Fried himself.  “Given the track record and the lack of contacts with other players (even 3AC actively interacted with BlockFi, Genesis, etc.), then we can point the finger toward someone from Alameda,” he tweeted, “And let's try to answer probably the most critical question, SBF or Sam Trabucco?”  Rise of BALD  Over the last weekend, the lure of meme coin fortunes in a starved market helped Coinbase’s new layer-2 blockchain Base attract some $68 million in ether (ETH) and over $200 million in trading volumes. Traders flocked to purchase bald (BALD) tokens, which jumped to $85 million market cap late on Sunday, with some traders like @cheatcoiner over $1.4 million from an initial $500 investment.  On Monday, BALD deployers started to remove millions of dollars in liquidity from the token's trading pairs in a sudden and unannounced move. This left thousands of holders in the lurch and caused prices to plunge as much as 90% as holders made a run for the exits.  All of this drama occurred with one humorous caveat: the Base blockchain isn't even officially open to the public yet, with a proper launch expected later this year.  Base, built by crypto exchange Coinbase on OP Stack, launched its testnet in January and opened to builders in mid-July basis the submission of applications to Base. Traction has been scant, so far, except for Sunday when the likes of BALD led to a sudden rush in capital - and users - to the blockchain.  Unlikely to be SBF  However, while the on-chain evidence is skewed toward suggesting that an Alameda-controlled wallet has interacted with the wallet used as a contract deployer, it’s unlikely that disgraced FTX founder Bankman-Fried is behind it – as some on social media app X speculated as of Tuesday morning.  As part of his bail conditions, Bankman-Fried’s access to the Internet is heavily controlled and restricted to a selection of news, sports, and educational websites.  Bankman-Fried’s parents signed an affidavit stipulating they would install monitoring software to restrict his access to the internet via their home connection.

Previously, FTX Trading, the now-defunct crypto exchange, had laid claim to a debt of up to $3.9 billion from Genesis Global, a contention firmly disputed by the crypto lender. This claim was subsequently downscaled to a maximum of $2 billion. Case History Genesis Global Capital, a lending unit under Genesis Global Holdco LLC, had raised considerable industry-wide concern when it halted customer repayments and subsequently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on January 20. The mega bankruptcy filing named over 100,000 creditors, with the firm's total obligations speculated to range anywhere from $1.2 billion to a staggering $11 billion. Amid the ensuing industry shock, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a complaint against Genesis and its ex-partner, Gemini, accusing them of the illegal sale of securities. This additional blow further complicated the company's predicament. Digital Currency Group, parent company of Genesis Global Holdco, assured its intent to consider options like an equity deal or sale to address the debts. DCG also revealed it had $150 million in cash reserves to aid in the restructuring process. Updates To The Bankruptcy Case In a recent update to a bankruptcy judge, the legal representatives of both companies indicated that their mutual claims would be settled in line with the agreement. Details of the settlement, however, remain undisclosed as of now. The companies intend to submit motions for approval of the deal to bankruptcy courts. This progress towards settlement is anticipated to be a welcome relief for Genesis creditors. They had been expecting the disagreement between Genesis and FTX to prolong the bankruptcy proceedings, potentially leading to delays in the payout of claims. With the dispute now seemingly close to resolution, the path to finalizing the bankruptcy proceedings appears clearer. Genesis Global's parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), had previously affirmed its commitment to resolving the claims against Genesis. In a letter to shareholders, DCG had expressed its optimism about reaching an agreement to resolve the bankruptcy case, offering a beacon of hope amidst the ongoing legal and financial challenges.

Potential liquidation would add to downside pressures on CRV, injecting volatility into the broader market.  Traders are piling into shorts through perpetual futures tied to CRV.  Decentralized exchange Curve's CRV token continues to lose ground as the looming threat of potential large liquidation of the founder's borrowed position has traders piling into short positions.  Early Tuesday, the cryptocurrency fell below 50 cents, reaching the lowest since Nov. 22, according to CoinDesk data. Prices are down roughly 30% since Curve fell victim to a reentrancy attack late Sunday.  The notional open interest in perpetual futures tied to CRV has doubled to $106 million alongside deeply negative funding rates, according to data source Velo. This is generally a sign of traders shorting or betting on a price decline.  The bearish positioning likely stems from fears that the potential liquidation of Curve founder Michael Egorov's large borrowing positions on Aave and Frax may destabilize Curve and the wider crypto market.  Egorov's collateralized holdings  ""Yesterday, several @CurveFinance pools were exploited. Curve founder Michael Egorov, currently has a ~$100M loan backed by 427.5m $CRV (about 47% of the entire CRV circulating supply). With $CRV down 10% over the past 24 hours, the health of Curve is in jeopardy,"" crypto analytics firm Delphi Digital tweeted.  Per Delphi, Egorov has borrowed 63.2 million tether (USDT) from decentralized lender Aave against collateral of 305 million CRV. The position will be liquidated if CRV/USDT pair drops to $0.37.  Egorov also supplied 59 million CRV to Fraxlend as collateral backing the 15.8 million FRAX loan. This borrowing is smaller than the USDT loan, but poses a bigger risk to CRV due to Fraxlend’s Time-Weighted Variable Interest Rate, according to Delphi.  Frax's time-weighted variable interest rate adjusts the interest rate up or down over time based on whether the utilization rate or the ratio of borrowed assets to collateral supplied is above or below a specified target range.  ""At 100% utilization, which it is currently at, the interest rate will double every 12 hours. The current interest rate is 81.20%, but can be expected to increase to the maximum of nearly 10,000% APY after just 3.5 days,"" Delphi explained in a tweet thread.  ""This astronomical interest rate could lead to his eventual liquidation, regardless of $CRV price,"" Delphi added. Liquidation would mean the collateral backing the loan, that is, CRV, would be sold off into the already weak market, creating volatility in the wider decentralized finance ecosystem.  Note that extreme bearish positioning in the token means potential for a short squeeze if and when concerns about Egorov's loan subside.  A short squeeze is a rapid move higher driven by bears abandoning their bearish bets. For a short squeeze to occur, the market needs to have a higher-than-usual bearish activity, as indicated by CRV's deeply negative funding rates. In such situations, a minor price bump can send bears or short sellers running to square off their positions, which, in turn, drives prices further up.

Several voices within the sector are suggesting a potential link to the already embattled ex-CEO of FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried. This has stirred up more confusion surrounding the former FTX leader, who is already ensnared in a legal quagmire. Piecing the Puzzle, Possible Links In the eye of the storm, a mysterious developer has abruptly withdrawn all liquidity from the BALD meme coin, creating ripples within the crypto sphere. The aftermath has led several blockchain observers to suspect a correlation to Sam Bankman-Fried, the erstwhile FTX chief. Currently under house arrest with severely limited online access, such allegations add to the increasingly perplexing narrative surrounding Bankman-Fried. ""From the looks of it, the BALD developer could likely be SBF or someone within Alameda,"" shared Adam Cochran, a partner at Cinneamhain Ventures, referencing the associated wallet address’s prior SushiSwap involvement. Cochran was further quoted stating, ""I am almost certain it is either someone from Alameda, FTX, or SBF himself."" Simultaneously, distinct phrases used by the BALD Twitter account, bearing close resemblance to Bankman-Fried's own posts, have intensified the conjecture around his possible involvement. Thus, the question remains: is the former FTX head the unseen hand behind the BALD debacle? A crowdsourced investigation on Reddit has added fuel to the fire, suggesting that the BALD developer wallet had been a recipient of deposits from FTX and Alameda over the past two years. Currently harboring 12,331 ETH, equivalent to nearly $22 million, this wallet has emerged as a key focal point in the BALD conundrum. Adding to the complexity, one Twitter user (@cryptobran_) highlighted that an address routinely depositing into the BALD wallet had previously been implicated in the Terra USD depegging incident last May. As these puzzle pieces fall into place, the implications could further darken the clouds over the involved entities. House Arrest and Legal Troubles Bankman-Fried's legal troubles continue to mount. The former FTX leader, currently under house arrest following his indictment by the U.S. Department of Justice on multiple counts of conspiracy and fraud, is under scrutiny for his online activities. In the wake of the BALD incident, the growing evidentiary trail implicating his potential involvement cannot be ignored. While the focus of the crypto community is firmly on Bankman-Fried, caution is being advised as the risk of unfounded speculation remains high. Nonetheless, the suggestion that someone within Bankman-Fried's inner circle may be involved has found broad acceptance. The evolving role of Sam Trabucco, former co-CEO of Alameda, has drawn attention, leaving the crypto community in suspense. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The re-booted exchange would only be available to offshore customers.  FTT token holders would get nothing, under the plan.  Defunct crypto exchange FTX has proposed to organize its creditors into different classes of claimants, and has provided a pathway for one class of claimants to restart the FTX exchange with third-party investors – should the group agree to it.  The filing, posted Monday night U.S. time, delineates the claimants into various groups. The first group is claimants of FTX.com offshore exchange, which it calls “dotcom customers”, next is customers of the U.S. exchange (“U.S. customers”), after, customers of its NFT exchange, then general unsecured claims, secured claims, and subordinated claims. Included in general claims are those from Alameda’s lenders or trading partners, while subordinated claims are taxes and fines from penalties.  The priority of these claims will be determined according to the ""waterfall priorities,"" and each class would get a pro-rata payout in what’s left of the pool after the preceding class is finished. The specific order of payout is determined following negotiations with stakeholders.  Members of the Dotcom claimants category – former customers of FTX.com – may opt to pool their assets to create what it calls an “offshore exchange company” or a “rebooted” platform not available in the U.S.  “Rather than all cash, the Debtors may determine that the Offshore Exchange Company remit non-cash consideration to the Dotcom Customer Pool in the form of equity securities, tokens or other interests in the Offshore Exchange Company, or rights to invest in such equity securities, tokens or other interests,” the document reads, suggesting that the debtors could forgo a cash payout for a stake in the new exchange.  Possible reboots of FTX have been hinted at before, with billings from interim CEO John Ray III filed in May referencing “FTX restart” or a “2.0 reboot”.  Singapore-based Wassielawyer, an anthropomorphic penguin-crypto Twitter legal personality, noted that the proposed restructuring plan does not include an allowance for holders of FTT.  The token was called a security by the SEC in a December complaint filed against FTX co-founder Gary Wang and former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison.  “No Holder of an FTT Claim shall receive any Distributions on account of its FTT Claim. On and after the Effective Date, all FTT Claims shall be canceled, released, and extinguished and shall be of no further force and effect, whether surrendered for cancelation or otherwise,” the document reads.

Bitcoin is down 0.16% to $29,236, and ether is changing hands at $1,857, down 0.27%.  eToro US Investment Analyst Callie Cox blames seasonality as a reason why the crypto majors aren’t moving.  “The seasonal patterns we see show that bitcoin prices have been a little bit weaker in August and September,” Cox said on CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program. “People are going off to the beach; they're not looking at their portfolios or trading their portfolios.”  But elsewhere in the market, chaos is looming.  CRV, the token attached to Curve Finance’s DAO, which recently suffered an exploit via a bug in the programming language used in its tech stack, is down 10.3% to 56 cents.  Part of the reason why the market is reacting in such a way is because of a lending position held by founder Michael Egorov on lending protocol Aave.  Egorov currently has a $168 million lending position on Aave secured by CRV, which is drifting toward liquidation. Should this be liquidated, the rapid price declines would cause a cascading series of liquidations, and the liquidated assets would flood the market.  As such, lending protocol tokens like AAVE, Compound’s COMP, Maple Finance’s MPL, and Maker’s MKR are leading the market declines. AAVE is down 8%, while COMP has declined 8.8%, MPL is down 3.2%, and MKR 2%.

Egorov has $168 million of CRV – Curve’s native token – securing loans from multiple DeFi protocols, data on blockchain analytics site DeBank shows. That equals almost 34% of the token’s total market capitalization. Following an exploit over the weekend at Curve, CRV’s price has sunk more than 20%, putting Egorov closer to levels where he’d get liquidated.  Litecoin, Ballet's Silver Cards  Litecoin is sometimes referred to as the “digital silver” to bitcoin’s reputation as “digital gold.” That reference appears to be the basis for a new crypto promotion by Litecoin creator Charlie Lee and his brother Bobby Lee, aiming to capitalize on a sudden surge in interest in the project, thanks to a quadrennial event in the blockchain’s lifecycle known as a “halving,” happening this week. Bobby Lee is CEO and co-founder of Ballet, a manufacturer of special cards used for “cold storage” or holding crypto offline. And he’s teamed up with his younger brother Charlie Lee, executive director of the Litecoin Foundation, to commemorate the blockchain’s third halving by creating 500 collectible cards made of 99.9% pure silver. The cards themselves – the silver alone – could carry a value of roughly $40 a card, but they would also be loaded with 6.25 LTC, or $581 worth. They are expected to be sold for about $1,000, which means the premium would roughly represent intangible value to buyers. All proceeds from the sale will be donated to the Litecoin Foundation to further the blockchain’s adoption and development, according to Charlie Lee.  Important events.
