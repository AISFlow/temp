42378509,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iTzX,1451505486,What Banks Should Be Doing With Blockchain in 2016,"William Mougayar is a Toronto-based entrepreneur, investor and independent scholar. He is the General Partner at Virtual Capital Ventures.  Here, he discusses insights gained from interactions with industry participants including banks, venture capital firms and startups across North America and Europe.  Banks didn’t plan for the blockchain. It just happened in front of them in 2015. But, they have been thinking a lot about its implications.  2015 was the year that banks started to wonder about their blockchain strategy. Banks that didn't have such a strategy were considered laggards.  But despite its revolutionary prognosis, the blockchain doesn't signal the end of banking, because the banks aren’t going to use it to disrupt or obsolete themselves.  Rather, they will guide it to live within the regulated constraints of their world.  The good news is blockchain implementations help banks strengthen and defend their positions. But here's the footnote: Innovation must permeate faster than the Internet infiltrated banking from 1995 to 2000.  Baby steps  In 2015, banks became interested in blockchain startups, fueled by their larger interest in FinTech activity.  Some banks invested in startups, including startup accelerators (eg Barclays' work with TechStars), but that only gives them a spectator seat, not a player one. The jury is still out pertaining to the direct benefits they'll gain, besides marketing visibility.  Blockchain and old constructs, such as clearing houses and private exchange networks (eg SWIFT, CCP, FIX, DTCC) are like oil and water: They will not mix well because one is based on centrally trusted intermediaries, and the other is based on exchanging intermediaries for peer-to-peer trust.  It is easier to start implementing blockchain solutions in new segments, without internal integrations.  So, here’s a thought: why not start with no baggage, and earn new customers that want to try something new?  Timid action  Having the blockchain without bitcoin is like having your cake and wanting to eat it too.  Banks rejected bitcoin as a knee-jerk reaction, rooted by regulatory compliance requirements, and fears they would lose control of the financial system. Both are valid concerns in the short term.  But bitcoin is a rich blockchain laboratory. Bypassing it results in a steeper learning curve.  Proofs-of-concept (PoCs) are timid experiments that don’t show commitments. They won’t always allow banks to see the potential benefits, so it’s better to implement smaller projects end-to-end, where results can be more visible. That said, POCs can be used to narrow down the portfolio of committed projects.  Venture capital may not be attracted to private blockchains because the banks are spending money on it. But many startups are going after the capital markets space, and most of them are getting funded by banks or private equity. That’s not a necessarily good sign.  Implementing the blockchain is 80% business process, 20% technology. Not the other way around.  Charging ahead  The biggest risks lie in seeing banks not directly getting their hands dirty with the new technology. Banks need to learn how to write smart contracts, and they should not outsource these tasks. Otherwise, they would be outsourcing their education.  Few people understand the blockchain within the average large bank, and while some entities have internal innovation groups that are leading the way, the question is whether their work will permeate the rest of the bank. Banks should take a page from the reengineering craze days, when a ""Reengineering Czar"" was a required person.  Appoint a Blockchain Czar position, especially if the CIO is not yet a blockchain enthusiast. (That person’s role is outlined the SlideShare below).  As far as anti-money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) practices, network-wide analytics are now possible, across institutions, providing an opportunity to reduce KYC requirements, while increasing monitoring and analysis.  But questions remain whether law enforcement authorities, financial institutions and regulators will embrace this paradigm shift by seeing its potential benefits.  Don't ask: What problems is the blockchain solving. Rather, think what opportunities does it create? (That’s a tough one to answer).  2016 predictions  As for my thoughts on the year ahead, some might be controversial, but here they are:  Compliance will move to intelligence. Regulation will show signs of reinvention. That's because you can monitor better with blockchain analysis software, and across institutions; something you can't do well with AML monitoring. (see slide #61)  Companies will use the blockchain like having a website. That's an analogy I made in a long essay here – Why Blockchain is the New Website.  $1.5bn in non-currency assets will be transacted on blockchains. Already Overstock announced that $500m will be pegged to the blockchain. That number will get big quick.  VC investments in blockchain related startups will exceed $2.5bn. This doesn't include what the banks will spend from their operating budgets, but it's not the same metric. Banks fund implementations, with large overhead costs.  Some FinTech companies will be challenged by blockchain contenders. Surprise! The blockchain also competes with traditional FinTech companies.  Some consortia will start delivering. But it’s not a panacea for everything. Banks were driven to consortia for fear of missing out, but they will have limitations that prohibit them from truly capitalizing on the tech.  Some blockchain startups will start to fail (visibly). This is good for the ecosystem, because we learn from failures, and it means we have pushed the envelope in order to figure out what the real boundaries are.  Bitcoin as a digital currency will enter online banking. All it will take is one bank to take the lead, and the rest will follow. It's not a technical issue, but a regulatory one that is holding them up.  In closing, the blockchain is not a lethal threat to banks, but it presents challenges and signals turbulent times for technology adoption.  It might be the last chance for banks to ride a significant technology-based innovation cycle. If the banking sector fails to embrace the blockchain, the field of ""alternative financial services"" (aka FinTech) will accelerate its growth even more, meaning that banks will have a smaller share of the overall financial services market.

42378498,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iTmx,1451505252,5 Bitcoin and Blockchain Startups to Watch in 2016,"Jad Mubaslat is the founder and CEO of BitQuick.co, the Ohio State Bitcoin Group, a former graduate of Boost VC and a bitcoin user since 2011. BitQuick.co is a P2P marketplace that allows individuals to buy and sell bitcoins in the US via cash deposit.  Nearing the end of 2015, many are questioning the future of bitcoin. 2016, it's safe to say, will be a crucial 12-month period.  For one, the technology's open-source community will need to resolve some outstanding questions, most notably whether it will increase the size of blocks on the blockchain. Meanwhile it must combat the effects of ""private blockchains"" seeking to court market share.  Ultimately, I am a firm believer in the future of bitcoin. While its progress throughout 2015 may not have captured the media’s attention as it did in 2013, the industry has created a solid foundation for the continued success and growth of the bitcoin network.  With the variety of applications now being built, it is difficult to imagine it simply fading away anytime soon. I truly believe we are only a few years away from bitcoin crossing ‘the chasm’ and becoming a ubiquitously acknowledged technology.  But the big question remains: Which use case will first bring about bitcoin’s wider acknowledgement?  With this in the background, here are the five companies that I believe will have a considerable impact on the industry this coming year.  Blockstream  One of the more well-funded startups, Blockstream is nonetheless a self-described ‘stealth bitcoin company’ working on accelerating the development of cryptocurrency, open asset and smart contact technology.  The company has been busy in the background, launching a beta of its banner sidechains project and announcing its first commercial product, Liquid, which is aimed at speeding up transfer times between bitcoin exchanges, in 2015.  One of the projects that Blockstream has decided to explore further is the Lightning Network – a proposal that would move smaller bitcoin transactions off the blockchain so they could occur more quickly with reduced fees. It nonetheless recreates the trustless nature of the current network design.  The Lightning Network has the ability to reduce the total number of transactions that need to be settled on the bitcoin blockchain, and thus removes their affect on the necessary total size of blocks.  The network faces technical challenges before it can go live, though, such as the integration of various changes to Bitcoin Core. I believe we will see most of these issues resolved and that Blockstream, or perhaps even a different party, will launch its version of Lightning during 2016.  This will greatly relieve the current buildup of pressure surrounding the block size discussion, and add to the robustness of the bitcoin network.  tØ  tØ is a blockchain-based trading platform created by online retail giant Overstock, first announced in August. Part of the firm’s larger Medici arm, tØ aims to revolutionise securities by making trade and settlement occur simultaneously using blockchain technology.  While the SEC did recently approve Overstock’s plan to issue stock via blockchain technology, Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne said in a recent article by Motherboard that it might not use the bitcoin blockchain as part of its efforts.  ""Maybe we're not going to use the bitcoin blockchain ... Maybe there's another blockchain we want to integrate with, with higher throughput,"" he told the news source.  This comment is in reference to the bitcoin block size, as a limited number of transactions also results in a limited number of instant settlements the company can offer.  Continuing with my belief that the block size issue will be addressed during 2016 in some way, I also believe tØ will utilise the bitcoin blockchain as opposed to a private blockchain due to bitcoin’s decentralised, secure and relatively trustless nature.  If this comes about, this would be the first major security settlement product released that utilises bitcoin, and a key milestone in bitcoin’s history.  OpenBazaar  OpenBazaar is currently working on one of the most compelling consumer applications for bitcoin out there with the development of a decentralised marketplace.  If successful, OpenBazaar would essentially serve as an open-source competitor to eBay that has reduced fees for all parties due to its decentralised nature.  OpenBazaar faces what I believe to be relatively trivial challenges in launching, including the development of a robust reputation system and the classic chicken-and-egg problem of acquiring volume in a new marketplace.  However, with its recent venture capital fundraise of $1m in June 2015, I believe we will see the highly anticipated launch and expansion of OpenBazaar during 2016.  Zapchain  Zapchain is a social media platform powered by bitcoin and is one of my personal favourite companies.  The startup’s integration of on-chain bitcoin micropayments for tipping is a truly revolutionary idea that fosters high-quality user engagement and content creation amongst various self-created communities.  Zapchain’s biggest hurdle lies in its ability to continue its growth, while avoiding spam users.  From what I have seen of Zapchain, though, its ability to curb spammers has proved effective and the platform is currently more popular than ever.  During 2016, I predict Zapchain will continue its growth in non-bitcoin related communities and also become recognised as a top bitcoin news platform. Zapchain embodies the spirit of bitcoin, and also provides a key alternative to some controversially moderated bitcoin communities.  BitFury  The best-funded bitcoin mining company with over $60m raised so far, BitFury announced on 16th December that it will bring a new ASIC chip to market in Q1 2016.  The launch of its new data centre in Georgia could double the total bitcoin network hashing rate, leading some to worry about the integrity of bitcoin’s mining decentralisation.  I believe this risk is perhaps overstated and that the major net effect of BitFury's innovations will be increased (and possibly almost doubled) security for the network.  Furthermore, affecting the integrity of bitcoin’s decentralised nature would act against BitFury’s best interests as a bitcoin company.  BitFury CEO, Valery Vavilov, has also reflected this sentiment, suggesting his company intends to act in the interests of the network as a whole.

42378502,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iTuV,1451496604,Why I'm Predicting a $650 Bitcoin in 2016,"Richelle Ross is an independent cryptocurrency consultant and a computer science major at the University of Florida, whose interests include programming and cryptology.  On 23rd July, I predicted on Quora that the price of bitcoin at the end of the year would rest around $420.  It appears at press time that I was not far off. As of 30th December, the bitcoin price is around $425. It seems I identified what many in the cryptocurrency community were predicting – 2015 was the year the bitcoin price would experience the slow and steadier growth it needed.  In previous years there were a lot of unknowns in the cryptocurrency world. It was often believed that a better currency may come along or that bitcoin was just another form of the fabled 'Tulip Mania', a period in the Dutch Golden Age used as an example for when the price of an asset outpaces its intrinsic value.  And these concerns were real possibilities because bitcoin was new, and there were growing pains it had to overcome.  Institutional acceptance  This year we learned that bitcoin is probably not going away anytime soon, as evidenced by the continued rise in transaction volumes and legitimization from mainstream leaders and institutions.  Larry Summers  , Blythe Masters and UK Chancellor George Osborne have all given approving statements on bitcoin or the blockchain.  Not only are the statements positive, though, they're increasingly bullish. For example, Summers, the head of US Department of the Treasury under the Clinton Administration, said he is behind the technology as he wanted to side with the ""history of change"".  Elsewhere, everyone from politicians to musicians was seeking to find new and novel ways to use and support the technology.  US presidential candidate Rand Paul began accepting bitcoin donations, becoming the first presidential candidate to do so, and indie songstress Imogen Heap released a song on the blockchain.  The list goes on: Patrick Byrne’s blockchain-backed stock platform was recently approved by the SEC; Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss launched their long-awaited exchange Gemini; more bitcoin investment vehicles have been started; the Coinbase service reached 3 million users; and bitcoin startup funding surged to total almost $1bn all-time.  Maturing conversation  Analyzing the bitcoin economy for the last couple years, I have been fascinated by the evolution of conversations between bitcoin skeptics and evangelists. But it's easy to forget how it used to be nearly impossible to read a bitcoin article without it featuring sources labelling it a Ponzi scheme or scam and an evangelist who claimed bitcoin’s price was going ""to the moon"" next week.  But, we’ve moved beyond these simplistic sides this year.  Now, the debate centers more on whether bitcoin can maintain its values and whether there will be a role for private or independent blockchains in a decentralized financial technology stack.  In essence, bitcoin is being discussed with more complexity and the pessimistic voices trying to write obituaries are dying out.  Whenever I’ve spoken to colleagues about bitcoin, what usually intrigues them is the global payment rail system.  It parallels the trends we see in communication and cloud networking – nation states are becoming less relevant to younger generations with global systems like the Internet, and that conversation came into the spotlight this year.  Reasons for optimism  Assuming that bitcoin remains the most popular token to run the blockchain and transaction volumes continue to rise, the next few years should be spectacular for the price of bitcoin.  While 2015 was a relatively calm year for the price, it seems likely that 2016 will be much more action-packed with the block halving next summer, where the amount of bitcoins awarded to miners roughly every 10 minutes will be cut in half.  We’ve laid down the tracks so to speak, allowing for there to be more confidence than ever before that bitcoin is, and can continue to be, a credible store of value.  With this in mind, I’ve decided to offer another price prediction for next year since I had some luck for this year. I believe bitcoin will surpass $500 by the middle of the year and average out to a $650 price range in the second half of the year.  Of course, there are too many unknown factors when predicting price to know with any certainty, but the maturing infrastructure has lead me to believe that next year will be an exciting one for investors.  Still, many of bitcoin’s best days come in reaction to world crises in places like Greece, China, and Argentina, meaning at the end of the day, there's no predicting where the price could go.  As we continue to patch up leaks in the global economy’s sinking ship, I have to wonder will 2016 also be the year we are reminded of why Satoshi created bitcoin in the first place.

42378500,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iTpT,1451486616,PwC's 3 Predictions for Blockchain Tech in 2016,"Jeremy Drane is practice leader of US FinTech, blockchain and smart contracts at 'big Four' professional services firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PwC), and Cathryn Marsh is leader of PwC FSI Institute, the company's division for new intelligence, perspective and analysis on trends affecting financial services.  In this special feature, Drane and Marsh outline their predictions for the year ahead in blockchain tech and outline the trends that will likely be key.  The speed at which blockchain technology is being explored and adopted is unprecedented.  We are watching it move from a startup idea to an established technology in a tiny fraction of the time it took for the Internet or even the PC to be accepted as a standard tool. Financial institutions are already beginning to realize the potential of this next-generation business process improvement software to structurally alter shared practices between customers, competitors and suppliers.  In our view, blockchain technology may result in a radically different competitive future in the financial services industry, where current profit pools are disrupted and redistributed toward the owners of new highly efficient blockchain platforms.  We anticipate a lot of changes as we roll into the new year and see three trends we believe will be important:  Incumbents will focus on protecting their intellectual property as they explore new collaborative opportunities with customers, suppliers, and competitors  Large financial institutions will need strategic plans to set parameters for technology risk taking  Market participants will start to develop the processes that surround the transactional layer.  Incumbents focus on IP  If you operate anywhere in the FinTech space, it's likely that you're already considering how to incorporate blockchain technology into your business.  Established players, such as banks and exchanges, are looking for ways to refine and improve all kinds of transactions, while startups and service providers that understand the new technology are trying to learn how best to connect to and complement these business processes.  As we enter 2016, we encourage established financial institutions entering into these conversations to understand what intellectual property they are sharing.  Many industry participants have focused on the positive impact of industry collaboration from a technology standpoint. However, strategic collaboration certainly does not fit this open model.  Consequently, we believe established financial institutions should build a core level of technical proficiency and understanding so they can better determine which information they should share in open forums versus what they should keep confidential.  Strategy drives risk-taking  We see 2016 as a year in which financial institutions will be inundated with many options as new participants enter the market and start to compete with early movers.  In 2015, we saw a large number of market participants begin to talk publicly about their innovative offerings related to blockchain.  However, there were numerous other companies working on solutions. The fruits of those investments will certainly come to market as the year unfolds.  As financial institutions explore their options in 2016, another challenge will be assessing the potential long-term viability of their FinTech partners.  Companies looking to develop proofs-of-concept, pilots and even make direct investments must understand the financial position and strategic focus of their potential partners as well as the ecosystems that support them. We don't know at this point who will survive to see their next round of funding, but we certainly see a divergence of the successful startups from those that are running low on funding or being acquired.  How can financial institutions filter, evaluate, and assess these new solutions to make sure they're a good investment?  We advocate for strategic plans that help set parameters and steer the direction of investments and establish solid criteria for selecting projects and partners.  Building new layers  In 2015, most of the focus of the market was on new transactional-based proof-of-concept solutions. As financial institutions enter 2016, we see attention shifting to the supporting systems and processes that underpin ongoing transactional excellence.  The industry will need to explore governance, auditing and IT security, to name a few.  We also see the beginning of the shift from financial institutions asking, 'How can we utilize blockchain?' to 'How can we establish the supporting processes to leverage this new technology?' and, more importantly, 'How do these new processes impact our risk profile?'  We advocate for early involvement of various corporate functions (such as compliance, risk and internal audit) so that proofs-of-concept don't get stalled and can more easily make the jump to the next round of internal funding.  2016 and beyond  The benefits from new technology are rarely shared equally among market participants. Said differently, there are always winners and losers.  As a result, the business benefits for many players may not materialize as promised.  We see a possible future where savvy market participants partner with only a handful of players (in strategic partnerships that we call microconsortiums) to focus on transforming expensive internal processes into efficient shared platforms. The resulting platforms could then be sold as a service to smaller competitors.  The ability to collaborate on both the strategic and business levels with a few key partners, in our view, could become key to competitive advantage in the coming years.  Given the speed of adoption of blockchain technology, it may feel as though you're sending your recent kindergarten graduate off to college. We see 2016 as the summer break, when a great deal of preparation must be packed into a short time frame.  Our advice? Make sure that you are not teaching too much more than you are learning. You’ll need a strategy for where you are going to place your bets.  And you’ll need to understand much more than the technology itself in order to benefit from it.

In statements, Nasdaq called Chain the first company to complete and document a private securities transaction with its Linq technology, a development the company and CEO Bob Greifeld termed a ""major advance"" for the blockchain industry.  For the transaction, Chain used the Linq platform to issue a record of ownership in the company to its new investor, while benefiting from what Nasdaq said was a reduced settlement time. No details were provided on the size of the investment or whether this funding was part of the company’s recent $30m Series A or a separate fundraising.  First announced in May and unveiled in October, Nasdaq's Linq proof-of-concept uses blockchain tech to manage the issuance of shares in pre-IPO companies. ChangeTip, Chain, Peernova, Synack, Tango and Vera are serving as the initial test group for the offering.  Nasdaq used the announcement to further discuss the big-picture implications it believes the blockchain could bring to financial services as the technology matures.  Greifeld stated:  ""Through this initial application of blockchain technology, we begin a process that could revolutionize the core of capital markets infrastructure systems. The implications for settlement and outdated administrative functions are profound.""  Nasdaq is, however, one of a number of players seeking to launch blockchain products aimed at the private equities market.  For example, New York-based Symbiont issued its first ""smart security"" on the blockchain in August, while Overstock released a ""cryptobond"" on its tØ platform in June.
