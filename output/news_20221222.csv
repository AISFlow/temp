At issue are about 56 million shares of the brokerage owned by Emergent Fidelity Technologies Ltd., a corporate entity organized in Antigua and Barbuda and 90% controlled by former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, according to the filing.  Three parties, the filing says, have tried to get control of those shares: BlockFi (a lender that FTX had helped prop up earlier this year), Yonathan Ben Shimon (an FTX creditor appointed as a receiver in Antigua and granted permission to sell the shares under supervision of a court there) and Bankman-Fried himself (who has legal bills).

FTX has determined that Emergent only ""nominally"" owns the shares and that they truly belong to FTX. ""Emergent is a special-purpose holding company that appears to have no other business,"" the crypto exchange said in the filing.  The judge overseeing the bankruptcy case should force the shares to remain frozen while FTX tries to figure out how to repay all its creditors, FTX argued in the filing.

The miners who were being kicked out of the network and could no longer use their machines had switched to others such as Ethereum Classic and Ravencoin to put their very specific machines to use. At the time, ETC’s hashrate had grown more than 200%, but now the network is seeing its hashrate fall once more. Ethereum Classic Hashrate Down By Almost 50% On Sep. 16, the mining hashrate of the Ethereum Classic network reached a new all-time high of 199.4 terahashes per second (TH/s) after climbing steadily for more than a week. With this growth had come more usage on the network, triggering staggering growth in its price. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retail Investors Now Hold 17% Of Total BTC Supply, But Is It Good News? However, as the Ethereum network has settled into its proof of stake (POS) consensus mechanism, the Ethereum Classic hashrate is correcting downwards. Hashrate is now down almost 50% in the last 3 months to be sitting at 109.3 TH/s on Dec. 22. ETC hashrate down almost 50% in 3 months | Source: Coinwarz The decline can also be attributed to the bear market and the muted interest from investors. Since bitcoin’s price touched below $20,000, all of the cryptocurrencies in the space have seen a similar decline. Ravencoin, another proof of work network that got massive attention following Ethereum’s move to proof of stake, has also seen its hashrate plummet in the last 3 months. Ravencoin’s hashrate now sits at 9.49 TH/s compared to its Sep. 22, 2022 peak of 17.59 TH/s. Meanwhile, other leading proof of work networks including Litecoin and Dogecoin has seen an increase in mining hashrate, whereas bitcoin remains mostly around 250 exahashes per second (EH/s). What About ETC Price? ETC, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum Classic network, was basically on a rollercoaster in the three months since Ethereum moved to proof of stake. At first, as the network began to get more attention, ETC’s price had risen drastically. It eventually peaked above $42 before starting another downtrend.

42413357,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl8UI4,1671748935,Ransomware Payouts Declined in 2022: Crystal Blockchain,"Known cryptocurrency payments to ransomware hackers “totaled a mere $16 million, compared to nearly $74 million USD in 2021,” blockchain intelligence firm Crystal Blockchain says.  This may be surprising given the fact that the number of ransomware attacks has increased since 2021, according to cybersecurity researchers. This year, the notorious Conti ransomware gang, known for terrorizing U.S. hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic, ceased operations, but new groups are constantly emerging.  Nick Smart, Crystal’s director of blockchain intelligence, told CoinDesk it may be too early to conclude that ransomware attacks are in permanent decline.  “Since the Conti leaks, we were able to gather a lot more information on historical ransomware and extortion activity, which is to say we have a better idea of what it was like before. Due to the way ransoms generally work, it’s not possible to tell what happened now as many companies don’t disclose payment information publicly,” Smart said.  Regrouping  Analysis of on-chain activity shows that crypto services with a high money laundering risk score – meaning they receive funds from scams and cybercrime more often than others – are seeing a drop in popularity, the report says.  “We can see that overall, crypto funds are increasingly exchanged between lower-risk [virtual asset service providers] likely due to increased regulation, registration and client expectations,” the report reads.  At the same time, crypto exchanges and services that manage to keep “dirty” crypto out, have been further tightening anti-money laundering policies, effectively scaring away criminal actors: “The volume of funds sent to low-risk exchanges from scams fell by 24% in 2022 compared to 2021,” the report said.  Offline wallets, allowing users to directly control their funds, are becoming increasingly popular among crypto users in general, the report says: more funds are being sent to such addresses.  Cross-chain bridges remain popular for illicit transactions. The Bitcoin-to-Ethereum bridge service Ren, for example, received almost a half of all crypto from sanctioned entities, the report said. The service, linked to now-failed exchange FTX, is popular among hackers.  “Perhaps the biggest endorsement of this trend was the FTX thief, who almost drained the entire of the protocol’s liquidity crossing chains,” Smart says. That’s not something new: Cybercriminals have been actively using Ren even before. However, the recent enforcement actions benefited the protocol.  “I think a lot of the attention on Ren grew after Tornado Cash was sanctioned [by the U.S. Treasury Department], which goes to show that criminals are always evolving tactics to try and beat blockchain intelligence companies and compliance teams,” Smart said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2022/12/22/ransomware-payouts-declined-in-2022-crystal-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5844591d4fc53908b4ecc1fda0511af88a269620-6024x4024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42410886,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggsDHB,1671747154,The Final Word on Decentraland’s Numbers,"Key takeaways:  Determining the population of Decentraland on an average day, or at events like its Music Festival, is a difficult task because the metaverse is fraught with bots.  CoinDesk worked with data company Atlas Corp. to create a number that reflects what we believe is an accurate count of active players in this metaverse.  810: The active population of Decentraland on an average day, according to our research.  3,668: Number of active users with a non-fungible token in their wallet at the Metaverse Music Festival.  Is it 38? 650? 7,000?  It’s tough doing a census of the metaverse.  Try as we might, CoinDesk, in the eyes of Decentraland’s fans, just couldn’t get the numbers right.  Metaverse platforms such as The Sandbox and Decentraland present a challenge of sorting bots from real people, and then even real people can be inactive or AFK, short for “away from keyboard” for hours, days, even weeks. One way to filter out bots is to filter users by those with non-fungible tokens (NFT), which also weeds out “tourists” who pop in for a quick look and leave without meaningful interaction. In addition, it can be argued that those users with NFTs matter the most because in a Web3 metaverse like Decentraland, users with NFTs such as ones that denote ownership of real estate in Decentraland (LAND) or wearable items that unlock some of the more popular experiences like ICE Poker are the ones who are most active in the platform, and certainly are the most valuable to the ecosystem’s success.  Another challenge in determining how many active users there are in Decentraland, despite there being an abundance of open-source data available on the blockchain, comes down to the fact that Decentraland and MANA token holders have a vested interest to make sure this number appears as large as possible. Certainly, publishers including Electronic Arts or Activision Blizzard want to see a high level of active players on their games such as Battlefield or Call of Duty, but their stocks have other fundamentals behind them and don’t rely on the rise and fall of a single game or platform. These games also don’t have the problem of idle bots that hang out to inflate the player base.  Hop into a session of either of these traditional games and you’ll be greeted with action from the moment you arrive. But log into Decentraland and you’re dropped into an apparent ghost town. There are players on there, and more in certain areas, but are they active?  So in order to figure out just how many active users there are on the platform we used every available tool out there to try and track this down, from DappRadar to Atlas Corp.’s data repository (which powers DCL-Metrics), to the open-source Catalyst Nodes Monitor, DappRadar and Nansen. We even tracked how many players went to the much-hyped Metaverse Music Festival thanks to Atlas Corp.’s data.  It’s important to remember that with one exception, which we’ll address later, these aren’t CoinDesk’s numbers. We’re reporting them directly from the source.  Here are the results:  Now we’ll dive into the details.  DappRadar: The #38DAUS and the players behind them  DappRadar’s Numbers:  38 (Original), 775 (Revised)  In the days that followed CoinDesk’s publication of DappRadar’s estimated daily active users in Decentraland, community members were quick to defend their beloved metaverse platform.  Some Twitter users called the story “fake news,” “poorly researched,” and that the “PayPal should fine [CoinDesk] $2,500” for spreading misinformation.  The chaos that brewed on Crypto Twitter led Decentraland to publish its strategy to define an active user of the platform.  It said in a tweet that it counts its “active users” as individuals who move from one “parcel” of land to another during the span of their gameplay, rather than tracking smart contract interactions through wallet data. Given this definition, it pointed out that it has 60,000 “monthly active users.”  The same day, DappRadar issued a statement reframing its data collection process, changing the metric of “Daily Active Users” to “Unique Active Wallets,” to more specifically define smart contract transactions within the metaverse world.  However, despite Decentraland’s clarification and DappRadar’s statement, some users pointed out that in the greater context of gaming platform user metrics, the metaverse platform’s numbers appeared low.  “[60,000] is still rather unimpressive. Given it being a whole world, is [60,000] people a lot?” said Twitter user @JbaumannD.  Decentraland said in a tweet that its user numbers have been lower than the “early metaverse hype of late 2021,” and that the community behind the platform is slowly building.  What started as a handful of Decentraland developers pointing out the inaccuracy of the platform’s low numbers eventually led users to create a meme, expressing their undying love for the metaverse, no matter how many users it might have. Creating the hashtag #38DAUs, users encouraged community members to play games, attend upcoming events and interact with each other in Decentraland.  “Wouldn't it be so much better if we could flip this into an opportunity; where the happenings of this pioneering, decentralized space are accurately documented in style?” said Sean Ellul, co-founder of Web3 design firm Metaverse Architects, said in a tweet.  Ellul is a vocal Decentraland community member, advocating for developers and bolstering the community. In November, Ellul authored a governance proposal to pause its grants program in light of the FTX collapse.  A small (but mighty) community, or a PR stunt?  While some Decentraland users come to the platform to play games or attend events, others are inspired by the community that’s associated with being an “active user.”  Matthew McMillian, founder of metaverse game Dice Masters and co-founder of Web3 social platform DCL Dating, told CoinDesk that the major reason for his presence in Decentraland is the community within the metaverse. He said in the beginning of his exploration of the platform he spent eight to 12 hours a day in Decentraland, making connections with other users while there.  “I try to go to different metaverses, and I haven't really seen a community that's as passionate and together as I've seen within the Decentraland community,” McMillian told CoinDesk. “If creators can build their communities and then start building economies around their communities, we're all you know, kind of contributing to the same thing that it's, like … we can create a real economy.”  While the community might keep some users coming back to Decentraland, its robust lineup of brand activations in 2022 welcomed new avatars to the platform.  March’s Metaverse Fashion Week brought in Estée Lauder, Dolce & Gabbana, and Forever 21 to host a week-long digital wearable experience. October’s Metaverse Music Festival included performances from Ozzy Ozbourne, Dillon Francis and Soulja Boy. Additionally, Decentraland has been home to activations such as Snapple’s Bodega, and Norway’s central tax authority’s office.  On Dec. 16, Bing Crosby’s estate opened its Winter Wonderland in Decentraland. The activation features holiday games, digital Christmas sweaters that avatars can wear and a museum dedicated to Crosby’s life. Crosby was “a firm believer in the wonders of technology,” according to Harry Crosby, the singer’s son.  Rob Dippold, partner and president of Digital Strategy for Primary Wave Music, the company that partnered with Crosby’s estate to host the activation, told CoinDesk that the 10 day-long activation aims to bring a new life to Crosby’s work and enable fans “to easily experience the wonders of a metaverse for the first time.”  While the “wonders” may come and go, all pop-ups must come to an end. So the question remains: While these ephemeral experiences in the metaverse may attract new users, what entices them to come back?  Atlas Corp.: Forcing transparency on Decentraland  Atlas Corp.’s numbers:  810 (Oct. 7, 2022 snapshot)  3668 (Metaverse Festival, NFT holder)  6,080 (Metaverse Festival, no NFT)  One of the loudest critics of CoinDesk’s reporting of DappRadar’s numbers was Miami-based Atlas Corp., calling it misinformation. In the initial aftermath of CoinDesk's report on DappRadar’s numbers, Atlas Corp. said that there were 8,000-10,000 daily active users on Decentraland.  While an article by PC Gamer called out that DCL Metrics (where Atlas Corp.’s data is published) is “a platform created by Decentraland to report user data, so take it with a grain of salt,” that isn’t entirely accurate and lacks an understanding of how decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) operate and fund things.  Atlas Corp. and DCL Metrics are both funded by grants from the Decentraland DAO that were proposed and voted on by holders of one of the DAO’s governance tokens, MANA, NAMES or LAND. This isn’t the same as Decentraland’s executives funding it themselves – it’s an arm’s length operation.  In fact, as Atlas Corp.’s co-founder, Avi Aisenberg, explained in an interview, it was a bit of an uphill battle to get the Decentraland Foundation to respect the need for transparency.  “If I had a single word to describe the Foundation it is opaque, which as you can imagine makes it difficult to build relationships. There is little public information on how it’s structured, operated, funded, etc. Over the course of two years, through our own investigative research, we’ve been able to learn a lot and it’s only added fuel to the Atlas Corp. fire,” he said via email.  Aisenberg said the Decentraland Foundation didn’t view transparency as important in the past, and Atlas Corp. effectively goaded it to begin sharing data – a forced transparency that benefits the community.  “Our methods are known yet we’ve had to stand our ground on multiple occasions to ensure access to the data is open, preventing breaking changes that would ultimately lock out the community from having the same level of access to the data as the Foundation and the DAO node operators,” Aisenberg continued. “I often wonder what it is that team was up to in the past.”  Crunching their numbers  When covering numbers from DappRadar and other tools, CoinDesk reported exactly what was being presented. But for Atlas Corp.’s numbers, more work was required. This is the exception to directly presenting the source's raw numbers we mentioned at the start.  While Atlas Corp. advertises 8,000-10,000 active users that number needs to be picked apart in order to get an accurate figure of active users. There are a few red flags, including the huge variance of the 8,000-10,000 figure from the other data sources, as well as the number of “Marathon Users” on DCL-Metrics, which shows a large group of users are spending close to 24 hours on the platform. Finally, there are a high number of users that are listed as “away from keyboard” (AFK) in some of the scenes, including the most popular location, ICE Poker:  So in order to account for all of this we need to perform some filtering on the raw JSON (a type of database file used for web applications) provided by Atlas Corp. of a snapshot from Oct. 7, 2022, which contained a list of wallet IDs and time on site. We used a Python Script to convert this into an Excel file while extracting user names and the presence of NFTs and aligning this into columns.  In order to find a more realistic number, we wanted to filter the following:  Figuring out the time spent “away from keyboard” (AFK). We did this by subtracting the average time spent from the average time spent away from keyboard, which DCL-Metrics provides in its ‘scenes’ section. We then averaged it out across the entire set of scenes. The result is 24 minutes, which we rounded up to 25.  The presence of an NFT in a Decentraland wallet is also an effective proxy of who is really an active user, as earlier noted. An NFT is needed to play ICE Poker, for example, though the NFT can be bought or borrowed from another player. If someone is playing with a delegated NFT, it will not appear in that person's wallet, but this does not materially affect CoinDesk's overall analysis. This metric filters out some of the casual users that treat Decentraland like a Web2 product and also eliminates many of the bots.  After applying filters via Google Sheets for both of these attributes we got a number back: 810.  A Google Sheet demonstrating all of our work is available to review here.  For Decentraland’s Music Festival we took a slightly different approach. Given that this event also serves as a ""sales funnel"" for Decentraland, we decided to generate numbers that include those that have and do not have an NFT in their wallet.  Atlas Corp. provided us with JSON files in a similar structure to the Oct. 7 snapshot that listed out the wallet ID and time spent across all of the scenes (there was an area called Main Stage and On Site) and the multiple dates.  We applied the same Python script to sort them into an Excel sheet and then to Google sheets. From there we used the same time filters to eliminate those that spent over 25 minutes and those that did/did not have an NFT. This time range was still a reasonable metric as most of the sets were 20-30 minutes long.  Our data shows that there were 3,668 users at the festival who also had an NFT.  The data shows that there were 6,080 users in total when the NFT filter was not applied. This larger number is expected given the high profile of the event.  Nansen and Catalyst Nodes Monitor  The other two tools that we used to determine the number of active users on Decentraland are Nansen and Catalyst Nodes Monitor.  Nansen’s Entity Billboard tool attempts to track the number of active users on individual platforms, everything from Uniswap to LooksRare, by looking at the activity on their respective smart contracts. Nansen stresses that this tool is very much in beta. In total, it tracks 3553 smart contracts across Ethereum and Polygon.  During our snapshot period, Nansen reported that there were 526 users on Decentraland on Oct. 7.  While some of the same criticism for DappRadar’s numbers could be applied, the fact that it seems to align with the number from Atlas Corp. would suggest that DappRadar’s numbers are more accurate than its critics suggest. After all, the key to finding out any number is the process of triangulation.  On the other hand, Catalyst Nodes Monitor takes a slightly different approach. It tracks the load on each of its servers which it calls catalysts. Atlas Corp.’s Aisenberg did provide some criticism of this method as there are nodes that remain untracked by the platform, so the real figure is possibly higher than captured.  Catalyst Nodes’ numbers show there were 600 users on Decentraland as of Oct 7. This figure comes from a scraped average across the morning, evening, and overnight.  A final note: The fun factor  Throughout this process, we tried hard to look at Decentraland from purely a quantitative, not qualitative, perspective. After all, taste is subjective but numbers don’t lie.  But it’s hard not to think about Decentraland in the qualitative: Is this a good game?  When speaking with Atlas Corp.’s Aisenberg, he likened it to ""Westworld.""  “On the most fundamental level, you have people jumping into worlds, and interacting with scenes that are built by other people. They don’t know how it works on a technical level necessarily nor do they care, and they are able to walk around and choose their adventure,” he told CoinDesk in an interview.  In Westworld’s fictional robotic playground, tourists can unleash their beastly and carnal desires to kill or fornicate to their heart’s desire. Reviews of the show equated it to an edition of Grand Theft Auto set in the wild west, with the show exploring hedonism and the horror of virtualized reality.  Though in Decentraland, you can’t do anything like that.  Whereas Grand Theft Auto V built a living simulacrum of Los Angeles and opened it up to online battles and the ability to complete missions with friends (it even has an online economy that’s currently suffering from inflation), Decentraland feels limited. Its activities are limited to walking around, playing poker, perhaps popping into a brand activation and going to an online concert. At the concert, you watch a video with friends in 3D or see a crudely-rendered concert animation that looks like it’s from the Playstation 2 era. We must admit our team enjoyed briefly jumping around together in a virtual winter wonderland, but we’re also unlikely to plan another group activity in Decentraland.  As of September 2021, GTA V has earned its developer $6.4 billion in revenue across 150 million units sold, with yearly expansion pack downloadable content, as players are still obsessed with dishing out wanton violence in its virtual city. Decentraland, at its peak when the token was worth $5.85, had a market cap of nearly $10 billion despite gameplay that most players would find boring. Now, with 93% of its value evaporating, that market cap is closer to $575 million and token with 30 cents.  CoinDesk got a lot of flack from crypto Twitter for reporting on the number of users on Decentraland, but even if after our analysis, you still believe in the highest number of 10,000 daily users, there’s still a long way to go to achieve the kind of mass success of games like GTA or Call of Duty, or mass adoption of online worlds like Roblox and Minecraft.  UPDATE (Jan. 3, 19:48 UTC): An NFT is required to play ICE Poker, but an earlier version of this story did not reflect the ability of NFT owners to delegate their NFTs. Players that have purchased an NFT will have the collectible reflected in their wallet, while players that have NFTs delegated to them from another player will not. However, this does not have a material impact on our count of the number of active users in Decentraland.",NEUTRAL,MANA,BLOCKCHAIN | MANA | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,"Cam Thompson, George Kaloudis, Sam Reynolds",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2022/12/22/the-final-word-on-decentralands-numbers,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/91bc7c3b23da883ad9bfb1793037df375a0dc297-2058x1030.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42413359,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl8UKs,1671746999,Crypto Markets Today: Federal Judge Releases Bankman-Fried on $250M Bond,"A federal judge agreed to release former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried after he appeared in U.S. federal court in New York on Thursday on charges that he was the mastermind behind the fraudulent and illicit movement of customer funds inside his former crypto empire. The judge set bail at $250 million and his release was secured with a bond.  This article originally appeared in Crypto Markets Today, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Bankman-Fried, who was brought to the U.S. overnight by the Federal Bureau of Investigation after his extradition from the Bahamas court cleared on Wednesday, arrived at the courthouse in New York to face the U.S. felony charges. The case in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York centers on accusations of fraud, money laundering and campaign-finance violations.  Bankman-Fried's release was secured by equity in his parents' Palo Alto, California, home, and a long list of requirements was included for him to remain free while he faces charges. He's not allowed to make financial transactions for more than $1,000, can't open new lines of credit, can't leave the house except to exercise and must go through substance-abuse and mental-health treatment, according to the agreement.  The former CEO arrived at court in a crumpled suit jacket, and the sound of his restraints was audible in the quiet courtroom. When asked if he agreed to the conditions of release, he nodded. He was then instructed to answer aloud, and he looked at his lawyer before saying, ""Yes, I do.""  Prosecutors have been closing in on the disgraced crypto frontman, inking plea deals inside the FTX inner circle. Caroline Ellison, the former CEO of FTX’s sister company Alameda Research, and Gary Wang, the other co-founder of FTX, pleaded guilty to federal charges and also admitted guilt in securities violations, according to statements from U.S. prosecutors and regulators late Wednesday.  The cooperation of Ellison and Wang – who admitted to playing active roles in the company’s fraud – is likely to be key in the case against Bankman-Fried. They’ve admitted that the senior management was aware of lawbreaking in the movement of customer funds between the two firms.

Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Crypto Market Analysis: Strong Economic Data Is Bad News For Bitcoin Bulls  By Glenn Williams Jr.  It’s challenging to find anything positive for crypto prices in economic data released on Thursday.  Strong jobs data and economic growth lead to higher prices, increasing the Federal Reserve’s motivation to put a lid on all three. This in turn leads to a decline in asset prices, impacting both traditional and digital assets.  Investors in traditional equities should expect to see a negative reaction to positive data as well. Investors in digital assets should keep in mind that both bitcoin and ether maintain strong correlations with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq.  Ultimately, the economy is still doing too well for the Federal Reserve to see positive signs in fighting inflation. Oddly enough, until the U.S economy starts performing poorly, asset prices are likely to suffer.  Read the full technical take here.

42413358,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl8UJw,1671744676,Bitcoin Protocol Development Steadily Progressing Despite Only 40-60 Monthly Active Developers: NYDIG,"In a world where giants of the conventional financial system including Visa, Mastercard and PayPal employ tens of thousands of employees, Bitcoin continues to be run by a tight ship of just a few dozen active developers.  New York Digital Investment Group (NYDIG), a Bitcoin-focused investment firm, published a report in September chronicling Bitcoin’s 14-year evolution from a software development perspective. The report, titled “Developers of Bitcoin,” found that there are only 40 to 60 active developers. The document sheds light on how Bitcoin has steadily grown from an obscure technological breakthrough, to worldwide domination, and examines the software developers who made it all happen.  What’s most mind-boggling, perhaps, is how the world’s most dominant cryptocurrency, currently worth about $320 billion, has been chugging along with no major hiccups for almost 14 years, under the care of a passionate – but small – group scattered across the globe.  “The purpose of the report was to help people understand Bitcoin’s development cycle: How it evolved from an idea circulated on a mailing group, to a pervasive technology today. And then, who are the people who continue to update the [Bitcoin] protocol,” explained Greg Cipolaro in a recent interview with CoinDesk. Cipolaro is NYDIG’s global head of research and co-author of the report.  Read more: So You Want to Be a Bitcoin Developer?  The Satoshi Era  Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin’s pseudonymous founder, published his white paper on Oct. 31, 2008, and subsequently launched the Bitcoin network on Jan. 3, 2009. He was soon joined by five other contributors, notably Hal Finney, a developer and cypherpunk who became the first bitcoin transaction recipient (courtesy of Satoshi), and Laszlo Hanyec, a programmer who famously paid 10,000 BTC (almost $170 million today) for two pizzas.  Read more: What Is Bitcoin Pizza Day?  With Satoshi at the helm, a community formed, but by 2010 that community had outgrown its founder. Realizing this, Satoshi gave Gavin Andresen the keys to the kingdom. Andresen, who was then an active contributor to the project, became Bitcoin’s “lead developer” and moved the project to open source collaboration platform, GitHub, paving the way for true decentralization.  “In a final email to developer Mike Hearn, Satoshi declared, ‘I’ve moved on to other things. It’s in good hands with Gavin and everyone,’” the report states.  Bitcoin development today  Nowadays, Bitcoin developers can be found worldwide. Roughly 84% of its GitHub commits – or suggested software changes – come from 20 different countries.  “One of the interesting things I thought we uncovered in the report is the geographic location of the developers,” said Cipolaro. “It’s helpful for investors who may be concerned about who's contributing and updating this piece of software. We know who they are and most of them seem to be in North America, Western Europe, those types of geographies.”  Another shift is the recent shelving of the lead developer/maintainer role in favor of a more egalitarian model that elects a group of maintainers instead. A “maintainer” is essentially a GitHub administrator with permission to approve software changes suggested by other developers.  Earlier this year, Gloria Zhao became the first female Bitcoin maintainer in the community's history.  Bitcoin by the numbers  According to the report, “code contributions have reached 200-400 commits monthly,” a steady, measured progression. And although Bitcoin’s core protocol averages 40 to 60 monthly active developers, 1,140 developers have contributed to the project since inception, with 5 to 20 new developers testing the waters every month (as others either scale back or leave).  The broader ecosystem (developers working on Bitcoin related applications) follows a similar pattern, but, of course, with higher numbers. NYDIG estimates the number of monthly active developers in that wider community to be anywhere from 600 to 1,000, with the total number of contributors being over 13,000 since inception.  When compared to competing networks, Bitcoin always seems to come out smaller, but exponentially more efficient. For example, previous estimates from venture firm, Electric Capital’s 2021 developer report, show Ethereum has over 4,000 monthly active developers in its broader ecosystem, compared to Bitcoin’s 600 to 1,000, yet Ethereum’s current market capitalization is less than half of Bitcoin’s.  Similarly, traditional payment firms such as Visa and Mastercard, with market capitalizations comparable to Bitcoin’s, are run by tens of thousands of full-time employees. (Bitcoin developers are all volunteers, many of whom are part time.) These numbers seem to not only illustrate the “ultra lean” nature of the Bitcoin machine, but also, the purpose-driven orientation of its contributors.  “Do you want the missionaries or the mercenaries? Do you want hired guns to come build things and then they leave when the money's gone, or do you want the missionaries who are here for a purpose?” said Cipolaro. “I think the people who are here for philosophical or ideological reasons tend to stay around longer and make more contributions than those who are just here for the money.”",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Frederick Munawa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/12/22/bitcoin-protocol-development-steadily-progressing-despite-only-40-60-monthly-active-developers-nydig,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6d7eb3bed4771d1097d56badaaedb120927422f8-2048x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42417075,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcRpOer,1671743170,5 Digital Economy Predictions for 2023,"If 2021 was the “Year of the Cryptocurrency,” then 2022 was the year it collapsed. Millions were made and lost by crypto investors while crypto companies were built and folded.  With 2023 right around the corner, one thing is clear: the “Roaring Twenties” era of 2022 crypto parties and the market’s overall irrational exuberance is over. 2023 is the year crypto will have to grow up and clean up its act. Ahead, here are five predictions for the next year in the digital economy.  Tal Elyashiv is co-founder and managing partner of SPiCE VC. This article is part of Crypto 2023.  Prediction #1: Natural selection of the crypto ecosystem  Natural selection of the digital asset ecosystem will be a powerful force in 2023 – and that’s a positive development. The good companies will get stronger, and the bad ones will fade away or be restructured – leaving a better-positioned market for the future.  We’re already seeing Darwinism sweep through the market, with only the well-managed, well-intentioned companies surviving. While there will be more shoes to drop as we head into 2023, this process is needed and very healthy for the future growth of the digital assets ecosystem. The reshaping and rebuilding of the industry’s reputation and the way it does business will continue to be driven by institutional investors requiring more controls, risk management, transparency and reality checks.  While we’re on the subject of institutional investors, firms like Softbank, Sequoya and Temasek (to just name a few) have some sobering up to do as well. This maturation and sobering up process will weed some of the fraud, incompetence and lack of experience out of the industry – and that’s a good thing. The companies left standing will be stronger for it and the industry will be better positioned to begin thriving once again.  Prediction #2: Regulation everywhere but here (U.S.)  Countries across the globe will make critical decisions on crypto regulation in 2023, while in the U.S., no meaningful regulatory movements will occur due to legislative dysfunction.  One thing we know for certain will happen in 2023 as it relates to crypto regulation in the U.S. is infighting (and lots of it). From the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to the Democrats and the Republicans, and let’s not forget the decentralized finance (DeFi) versus traditional finance (TradFi) crew, 2023 will be just as entertaining as WWE, so grab the popcorn. However, no one benefits from stalemates from unresolved power struggles, and this coming year won’t be any different in the digital economy. While one would like to hold out hope that a new Congress can accomplish meaningful crypto legislation, the likelihood of it happening is as high as Sam Bankman-Fried keeping his Bahamian penthouse.  But while the U.S. squabbles and debates, countries around the world are making progress and 2023 should see many of these regulatory regimes take shape.  The European Union is taking a massive step early in 2023 to vote on and implement the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCAR/MiCA), which lays out a framework to regulate both the issuance of cryptocurrencies and assets, and transactions (i.e., trading, investment and payments). Specifically, the MiCA bill contains several provisions regulators say are necessary to “rein in the Wild West of the crypto world.”  Meanwhile, Asian regulators are each taking on crypto guardrails differently. Hong Kong’s goal for 2023 is to increase retail access to crypto, which requires a specific regulatory strategy to support those objectives. In sharp contrast, nearby Singapore has signaled that it will tighten regulations after big losses this year for investors, while South Korea, still dealing with the aftermath of the collapse of Terra, will focus solely on enforcement. On the other hand, India, somewhat uniquely in the region, is using tax policy to drive behavior.  Prediction #3: The metaverse and NFTs come back from the dead (but not the way you think)  The glitz and glamor of the metaverse and non-fungible tokens may be tarnishing, but the practical, versatile and inevitable uses for both will be much clearer in 2023.  The recent narrative about the metaverse’s demise (partly based on Meta Platforms’ dismal financial outlook) are premature, the same way the exuberance about its immediate relevance and market adoption a year ago was. No one should be looking at Meta and the overall building of the metaverse infrastructure as a 2023 or 2024 project. The truth is, the metaverse is inevitable, but it will take years to fully come to fruition. With that said, 2023 will mark the beginning of how we perceive “metaverse experiences.” New use cases in enterprise, healthcare, education and more will bring the practical utility of smaller doses of the metaverse to our collective attention – even in our daily lives. Advances in identity technology, along with AR/VR devices (think Apple’s XR project) will come into focus as well in 2023.  The same is true about NFTs. The non-fungible token market will also go through a rebirth of sorts in 2023, moving further away from being a value driver on its own in the digital art and collectibles domain and closer to being what the technology was meant to be – mostly digital proof of provenance and authenticity of an object, with its value deriving only from what it represents. 2023 will also see the NFT’s versatility beginning to shine. The funnel of innovative ways to leverage NFTs will continue to widen in 2023. From supply chain and logistics to healthcare, real estate and retail, NFTs will have a more pervasive and permanent role in digitizing operations.  Prediction #4: 2023 may be the ‘Year of the CBDC’ around the world but there will be no digital dollar in sight  The CBDC arms race will continue as central banks create alliances with commercial banks and technology providers to strengthen their position to test, launch and execute on their unique CBDC strategies.  With more than 80% of the world's central banks already considering launching a central bank digital currency (CBDC), 2022 was mostly full of trials and testing. However, the movements by nations across the world to make CBDCs a reality is picking up speed and will become a major priority in 2023 – especially as the race to set a global standard is in sight. Additionally, commercial banks are increasingly interested in the space and will begin (or continue) to partner with central banks and software vendors to ensure success and mass adoption.  While China’s digital yuan is far beyond the rest, many countries are making headway – with 2023 goals of rollout a possibility. The Bank of Japan is piloting a rollout with major banks in early 2023. Turkey announced it would launch its CBDC next year, while the ECB intends to start work to develop a rulebook in early 2023 on rolling out a digital euro. The money and payments world is clearly on a path of adopting blockchain more broadly in 2023, with SWIFT even recognizing the need to move in this direction.  Prediction #5: Institutional investments in the digital economy will skyrocket  Institutional investors will make big moves with their big money.  We learned in 2022 that beyond crypto’s organizational woes it is closely tied to traditional market movements and the overall economy. For 2023, the domain’s performance will again depend on world economic sentiment. If concerns ease, we may see an uplift in crypto prices as well as investments in the digital asset market.  Regardless of the market trends, we will likely see more traditional, blue chip funds (i.e., KKR and Hamilton-Lane together with Securitize) tokenize – making them more accessible to a broader sphere of investors. Additionally, more and more large cap market players will move into the tokenization space (i.e., JPMorgan, HSBC, Fidelity, Goldman Sachs) and we’ll see a significant uptick in mergers and acquisitions activity as a result. However, a caveat to all of this, as mentioned prior, is whether or not legislators and regulators step up to provide some needed stability.  2023 will also be an excellent time to invest in venture capital funds focused on the blockchain ecosystem (not crypto funds). History shows VC funds that raise during recessions outperform funds with different vintages. Plus, it makes a lot of sense because valuations in the blockchain ecosystem are going to be much more reasonable and down to Earth over the next couple of years.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Tal Elyashiv,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/12/22/5-digital-economy-predictions-for-2023,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2e5ec92d73ea8873718094225acbacedc1a62430-4256x2832.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42420847,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWtVhl,1671738605,Crypto Markets Analysis: Strong Economic Data Is Bad News for Bitcoin Bulls,"Good news is bad news again: Just as traders in cryptocurrencies and traditional finance were looking forward to saying goodbye to 2022, a dose of better-than-expected economic data may have damped the mood for asset prices yet again.  At the risk of sounding absurdly obvious, inflation remains an albatross around the neck of global economies. The gallows mentality of markets was that as economic data worsened with growing predictions of a U.S. recession in 2023, the Federal Reserve and other major central banks would ease off on their push to tighten monetary policy – perhaps the single biggest source of downward pressure on asset prices all year.  So data released Thursday suggesting the economy might still be humming along has suddenly reversed the narrative. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of large U.S. stocks tumbled 2.8%, the biggest single-day drop in three months. Bitcoin (BTC) is down 1.1% over the past 24 hours, based on the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index.  The challenge with inflation is that it impacts everyone, and that's a key reason the Fed is unlikely to let up. The decision to purchase a financial asset, whether bitcoin, equities or anything else, is usually discretionary. The decision to purchase food, energy and household goods is not.  Declines in asset prices generally burden the owners of those assets. Increases in overall prices act as a flat tax on essentially everybody.  The economic data released Thursday shows that this tax isn’t set to decrease just yet.  Initial jobless claims: Initial jobless claims of 216,000 were lower than the expected 225,000. Continuing jobless claims were stronger than expected as well.  While on the surface this appears to be good news, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has emphasized that the labor market needs to “soften.”  In the Fed’s view, labor market demand is out of balance with supply. The stronger-than-expected report raises the possibility that the Fed will continue attempts to slow overall job growth to keep wage increases in check.  David Tepper, a top-performing hedge fund manager, told CNBC on Thursday, “When the Fed says they’re going to do something, I tend to believe them.”  Gross Domestic Product (GDP): The U.S. economy’s third-quarter growth was revised higher to 3.2% from the 2.9% estimate released on Nov. 30. This should also be filed under the “good news = bad news” category. The Federal Reserve would likely prefer to see a contraction of growth as a necessary evil to quell price increases. Much of the growth was driven by increases in consumer spending, which will put upward pressure on prices.  GDP Price Index (GDP Price Deflator): The U.S. GDP price index rose 4.4% in the third quarter to a record high. A distinction between the consumer price index and the GDP Price Deflator is that the deflator is designed to capture changes in prices for all final goods and services. The CPI, by contrast, measures price changes for a “basket of goods.” The Deflator is often viewed as a more comprehensive look at price increases. Its move to a record high is likely the exact opposite of what the Federal Reserve wants to see.  What does this mean for crypto prices?  It’s challenging to find anything positive for crypto prices in these reports.  Strong jobs data and economic growth lead to higher prices, increasing the Federal Reserve’s motivation to put a lid on all three. This in turn leads to a decline in asset prices, impacting both traditional and digital assets.  Investors in traditional equities should expect to see a negative reaction to positive data as well. Investors in digital assets should keep in mind that both bitcoin and ether maintain strong correlations with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq.  Ultimately, the U.S. economy is still doing too well for the Federal Reserve to see positive signs in fighting inflation. Oddly enough, until the U.S economy starts performing poorly, asset prices are likely to suffer.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/12/22/crypto-markets-analysis-strong-economic-data-is-bad-news-for-bitcoin-bulls,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8b7d0623147cff85d540fc99cb3a31bea034953a-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Wright first caused an uproar in the Bitcoin community with a 2016 blog post in which he claimed – with questionable evidence – to be Bitcoin’s inventor. He’s since gone to court defending his claim, filing lawsuits containing accusations ranging from libel (where he sued Magnus Granath, also known as “Hodlonaut,” for calling him a fraud) to copyright infringement (where Wright successfully petitioned courts to have the Bitcoin white paper removed from bitcoin.org).  After six years in the spotlight, Wright seemed to suggest via Twitter on Wednesday that he would finally put his Satoshi court crusade to rest.  “I have been too angry for too long, as I cared for external validation. That ends,” he tweeted.  “I no longer care what you think. I care for my wife, my mother, and my family,” Wright said. “The only validation I seek now is from my family. The rest is no longer important.”  Wright’s tweet thread followed the latest in a series of blows to his Bitcoin inventor claim, which he has thus far struggled to back up with concrete proof in the eyes of courts and much of the public. Just before Wright’s tweets, a judge unequivocally stated that “[i]t is important to be clear that Dr. Wright has not established that he is Satoshi” in the final judgment in a defamation case between Wright and podcast personality Peter McCormack.  Although Wright may indeed take a break from litigation, it doesn’t seem he’ll be backing away from his claim to be Satoshi anytime soon. “Creator of Bitcoin” is still proudly displayed on his Twitter profile and website.  Per one of Wright’s tweets on Wednesday, “My vision is my goal, and I will never stop working to achieve it.”  Read more: Craig Wright’s Satoshi Proofs ‘Not Credible’ and a ‘Farce,’ Hodlonaut Lawyers Say     CORRECTION (Dec. 23, 2022 15:02 UTC): Corrected Granath's alias in second paragraph.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC,Frederick Munawa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/12/22/craig-wright-signals-hes-given-up-on-convincing-courts-he-invented-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1d8e31f7c4fb759f74456cbac0392e470e04fcf7-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42413361,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl8ULo,1671736393,Tron’s Justin Sun Was Secret Top Client of Crypto Asset Manager Valkyrie,"Tron founder Justin Sun is one of the richest figures in crypto, and a good chunk of his bitcoin (BTC) is stored in one place: U.S.-based Valkyrie Investments.  The altcoin kingpin had more than $580 million of BTC stashed with the crypto asset manager at one point in August, according to a private financial document that CoinDesk reviewed. That amounted to over 90% of money at Valkyrie’s largest division, Valkyrie Digital Assets LLC, the document shows.  In other words, Valkyrie Investments, a money manager that pitches crypto products to Wall Street investors, mostly relied on Justin Sun, a controversial Chinese crypto billionaire. (The current state of Valkyrie’s assets is unknown.) Sun has also said he’s one of Valkyrie’s biggest shareholders.  It’s yet another example of centralization in crypto, an industry rife with whales carrying outsize clout, in spite of its decentralized ideals.  Sun’s relationship with Valkyrie popped up in ways that benefited his empire. For example, Valkyrie built investment products for “Justin tokens” such as Tron’s TRX and BitTorrent BTT that other crypto asset managers say they avoid. It promoted Tron using the blockchain network’s developers’ own marketing materials. It even let Tron share its spotlight on Wall Street – literally – with someone wearing a T-shirt bearing the Tron logo joining Valkyrie’s bell-ringing at Nasdaq in September.  The financial lives of individuals are almost always nobody’s business. Sun’s previously undisclosed, outsized percentage of Valkyrie’s assets under management (AUM) is an exception. The depth of the relationship is a matter of public interest because it raises questions about Valkyrie’s reliance on a single client for growth.  Sun is a notable and polarizing figure in the crypto industry. He is the founder of the Tron blockchain, which has spawned repeated controversy. Tron issued, for example, an algorithmic stablecoin that researchers derided as a “clone” of the doomed UST/LUNA setup.  Valkyrie Investments Chief Investment Officer Steve McClurg would not discuss the source of Valkyrie’s client funds, citing confidentiality. Sun didn’t respond to a request for comment.  Assets under management  Sun’s money touched every section of the business, from separately managed accounts to trusts and even Valkyrie’s bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund (ETF). Having large assets under management (AUM) can help a fund manager promote itself to prospective clients and also potential financial backers. Bigger is generally better.  For a few months this year, Valkyrie did have another whale, or major investor: It signed a $700 million partnership to manage treasury funds for crypto protocol NEM/Symbol in January. Weeks later, the company said its AUM had surpassed $1 billion, according to a February press release. But that deal fell apart in months and NEM/Symbol took back its tokens, according to people at the protocol.  McClurg told CoinDesk that Valkyrie continues to partner with NEM/Symbol. That protocol does not appear on the private Valkyrie document that CoinDesk reviewed.  Tokens from Sun's Tron blockchain anchored Valkyrie’s TRX trust, its largest trust at $37 million, according to a person familiar with the matter.  Also, Sun in October 2021 called himself the largest investor in Valkyrie’s bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund (ETF).  It’s not exactly clear why Sun, a knowledgeable crypto founder who recently told CoinDesk he self-custodies most of his tokens (and also has custody partnerships with Binance, Huobi and Fireblocks) would put so much bitcoin in a pricey SMA.  SMAs are portfolio management products that Valkyrie sells to investors who want to directly own their crypto but leave the fuss of buying and selling to a money manager. It charged a 1.5% fee when it officially launched its SMA service in October.  John Key, the former head of Valkyrie’s SMA product, said Sun’s SMA was an institutional-type product that differed from the retail offerings.  Having one whale in an SMA doesn’t necessarily pose a threat to clients with money in other products. But it could become problematic for the asset manager’s fee revenue – and its ability to pay staff – if that client ever decided to leave.  “If you had a hedge fund that had six pieces out of seven in the hands of one player, you couldn't swing the budget, if you know what I mean,” said Chris McHugh, an economics professor at Tufts University.  Strategic partners  Sun may have been Valkyrie’s private whale, but he’s a vocal backer of the Nashville, Tennessee-based firm. He joined its mid-2021 equity round and his Tron blockchain called Valkyrie a “strategic partner” when it launched Tron Trust three months later. As an equity investor in the business, his incentives appear to be heavily aligned with Valkyrie’s.  On Valkyrie’s end, CEO and founder Leah Wald has taken a board position at crypto exchange Huobi, which Sun reportedly acquired. Sun is also a board member.  Crypto trusts are private investment funds that give accredited investors a way to buy exposure to cryptocurrencies without holding any tokens. Firms such as Bitwise, Osprey, Valkyrie and Grayscale (CoinDesk’s corporate sibling) sell trusts covering a range of cryptocurrencies to the Wall Street crowd. But only Valkyrie sells a TRX trust. Valkyrie also created – but didn’t launch – a BitTorrent trust product.  Sun viewed Valkyrie as the Tron ecosystem’s access route to U.S. investors, according to his public statements. In September 2021 he said Tron would work with Valkyrie to list its Tron trust on over-the-counter markets and ultimately help it create a Tron ETF. Both steps would mainstream the cryptocurrency in the U.S. Neither event has come to pass.  For its part, Valkyrie discusses its Tron trust with a document chock full of platitudes, buzzwords and paragraphs lifted verbatim from Tron’s own website.  “The TRON network completed full decentralization in Dec 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO,” the April 2022 document, which carries Valkyrie’s logo, declared as it parroted language seen on Tron.network in January. At least seven sections of the document appear to be taken directly from other sources without citing them.  Though he wouldn’t discuss Valkyrie’s clients, CIO McClurg confirmed that Valkyrie has a partnership with Tron.  “I’ve known Justin for many years. We had representatives on the Tron hackathon, we’ve got strategic partnerships with them” and other protocols, he said.  The partnership has seen Valkyrie toy with creating trusts for one Sun-linked token that two other asset managers, who requested anonymity, said they would never touch: BitTorrent, software for sharing – or pirating – files. Tron bought BitTorrent for $120 million in 2018 and promptly launched a BTT token to incentivize users.  Valkyrie signaled its intent to create a BTT trust with an August 2022 fact sheet and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing in October. McClurg said Valkyrie didn’t move forward with the fund because of the rocky crypto market.  Valkyrie’s own finances have been battered by the crashing markets. In recent days it fired 30% of its staff in response to “a thorough review of asset growth.” It also lost its biggest investor in an earlier funding round.  Still, McClurg said Valkyrie is soldiering on.  “The company’s in a good position. Despite the crypto winter we're growing again,” he said.",NEGATIVE,BTC | BTT,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | BTT,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/12/22/trons-justin-sun-was-secret-top-client-of-crypto-asset-manager-valkyrie,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cc751f311e9d9ae1a5e1154b70b0a7b1f436cccb-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) behind Aave, the popular DeFi protocol on Ethereum, approved blockchain oracle Chainlink’s Proof of Reserve smart contract by a vote of over 99% in favor. It will specifically cover Aave versions (v)2 and v3 on the Avalanche blockchain.  Bridged assets are DeFi’s way of moving value between blockchains that don’t normally communicate with each other. The asset gets locked in a smart contract on its home chain; then, a clone is issued on the target network. Aave v3 on Avalanche has bridged versions of DAI, USDT and USDC, among other tokens.  But this setup creates many security vulnerabilities, and hackers have repeatedly exploited token bridges. This year, Web3 game Axie Infinity’s Ronin network and cross-chain protocol Nomad faced exploits totaling over $800 million due to breaches on their token-bridges.  Bored Ghost Developing, the Web3 studio behind the proposal, says its PoR smart contracts will give an extra layer of security to Aave’s Avalanche implementation, but can also help mitigate attacks on bridged assets on the network.  “The focus is more on automatically detecting and acting whenever any symptom of security issues on a bridge appears,” said Ernesto Boado, the former chief technology officer at Aave and co-founder at Bored Ghost Developing, which wrote the proposal. “We think that obviously, transparency goes first, in this case, our development goes a step further.”  Under the proposal Aave will use ChainLink PoR’s aggregator smart contract to protect tokens on the original network (Ethereum) as well as their bridged versions on the target network (Avalanche).  Max Melcher, go-to-market lead of proof of reserve at Chainlink Labs, told CoinDesk that proof of reserves allow decentralized technologies to accurately report on reserve values, rather than trusting a single party to do so.  “Leveraging Chainlink Proof of Reserve, Aave can verify that bridged assets accepted on the platform are fully collateralized before allowing users to borrow against them,” said Melcher.  Proof of reserves have recently been in the news post-collapse of FTX because the industry is demanding more transparency from centralized exchanges (CEX). Earlier this month, popular exchange Crypto.com’s reserve ratios show that investors’ assets are safely backed.

The key factors shaping global markets are changing, and cryptocurrencies are bound to follow the general trend into the new year. Related Reading: Bitcoin Correction Soon? MVRV Triple Ribbon Approaches Bearish Cross As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $16,800 with sideways movement in the last 24 hours. On higher timeframes, the cryptocurrency records a 6% loss. Other assets in the crypto top 10 by market capitalization are moving in tandem with BTC and record losses in this period. Bitcoin Investors Should Brace For Incoming Volatility Bitcoin and the crypto market are poised for volatile days during the holiday season. From now until the end of the year, markets will see less trading volume, making assets susceptible to sudden price movements. According to a report from crypto exchange Bitfinex, the number of active Bitcoin addresses is declining. This number has been trending to the downside across 2022. The chart below shows that the number of daily active addresses averaged 921,445 during this period, representing a decline of 1.1 million compared to 2021. This reduction in activity will contribute to the spike in volatility. The last week of the year has seen a steeper decline in activity, and trading volume, since 2013. In addition, the downside action Data since 2013 suggests that there is always a decline of 3-4 percent in the number of daily active addresses in the last week of the year compared to the previous month. Aside from the decline in trading volumes, the fall in DAA could also correspond to reduced mining operations as miners’ activity corresponds to BTC’s most significant on-chain movements. Finding Direction For The BTC Price According to the report, one metric is vital to forecast BTC’s direction amid higher volatility. This metric is the Monthly Realised Volatility, which measures what has happened in the market over the past 30 days. This metric is at its lowest “since Q3 of 2022, just before the last bull run.” As seen in the chart below, each time Monthly Realised Volatility reached similar levels, the Bitcoin price trends to the upside over the coming months.

Bitcoin SOPR Ratio Hits Lows Not Seen Since 4 Years Ago As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the SOPR Ratio has a value of just 0.53 right now. The “Spent Output Profit Ratio” (SOPR) is an indicator that tells us whether Bitcoin investors as a whole are selling at a profit or at a loss currently. There are two main investor groups in the BTC market, the “short-term holders” (STHs) and the “long-term holders” (LTHs). STHs include all holders that have been holding onto their coins for less than 155 days, while LTHs are investors who have been keeping their coins dormant for longer than this threshold amount. Now, there is a metric called the “SOPR Ratio” that measures the ratio between the SOPR values for the LTHs and the STHs. When this indicator has a value greater than 1, it means the LTHs are realizing more profits than the STHs right now. On the other hand, values below 1 suggest STHs have been raking in a higher amount of profits. Related Reading: Altcoin Indexes Take Beating As Investors Flip Alts For Bitcoin Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin SOPR Ratio over the course of the entire history of the cryptocurrency: The value of the metric seems to have declined recently | Source: CryptoQuant As the above graph highlights, the Bitcoin SOPR Ratio has historically gone below a value of 1 during bear markets. The reason behind this is that the holders who bought during the preceding bull run slowly mature into LTHs as a bear takes hold, while the STH cohort starts being made up of investors who bought at the lower, bear-market prices. Related Reading: XRP Accumulation: Key Sharks And Whales Group Hits All-Time High Holdings During bears, both holder groups generally realize losses as a whole, but since STHs acquire their coins at relatively lower prices, their losses are lesser. The reverse happens in bull runs, as the LTHs who bought at the cycle lows amass large profits, and thus the SOPR Ratio attains values higher than 1. Recently, the indicator has dropped to a value of 0.53, which suggests large-scale capitulation from the LTHs. The current value is the lowest since February 2019, around when the lows of the previous cycle were observed. This could hint that the bottom for the current bear market may also be near, if not already in. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s price floats around $16,800, down 4% in the last week.

But what exactly is the phenomenon, and how often has the Christmas miracle occurred in the past? What’s A Santa Claus Rally? The Most-Wished For Gift By Bitcoin Bulls A Santa Claus rally is defined as a “calendar effect” that occurs right around the holidays. According to Investopedia, there’s some slight disagreement over the exact timing of a Santa Claus rally. One camp claims its the lead up to Christmas where stock holders get an early present, while the other side states its the post-Christmas week leading into January 2nd. The idea behind the rally is the same: investors are suddenly euphoric due to the joyfulness of the holiday season, are considering year-end tax-related repositioning, and often have fresh Christmas bonuses to spend. The low-volume and liquidity holiday market conditions allow prices to move more swiftly, like Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, and Vixen through the snowy night sky. Related Reading: No Santa For Cryptos This Year: Large Cap Coins Touch December Lows Investopedia further concludes that there isn’t much validity to the idea behind the Santa Claus rally when analyzing S&P 500 returns during this period. But what about Bitcoin and crypto, where retail investors dominate the market and trade 24/7 – even on Christmas Day? The complete history of holiday seasons in crypto | BTCUSD on TradingView.com The Scrooge Effect: Bears Say Bah Humbug To Possible Crypto Rally The above chart depicts the crypto version of the Santa Claus rally, taking into consideration both the weeks before and after the annual holiday. At only a mere few cents, a breakout Christmas rally sustained until Bitcoin reached $40 for the first time. In 2011, December price action was more red than green. The next Santa Claus rally kept delivering gifts for crypto holders for nearly an entire year, until December 2013 struck and one of the worst downtrends on record followed all the way through until December 2014. Bitcoin reached its final bear market bottom back then only days away from Christmas. The following two Christmases in 2015 and 2016 were merry and bright for Bitcoin bulls. But December 2017 euphoria around Christmas-time turned out to be the top, resulting in yet another bear market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bear Market Monthly Momentum Reaches Worst On Record In 2018, we’ve marked December in blue as the most neutral of all holiday price action. Although Bitcoin had fallen prior, it had already bottomed, and in the months following began a new bull run. It’s tough to call this price action bullish or bearish. Much like the bull market in 2015 and 2016 saw back to back green seasons, so did crypto investors in December 2019 and December 2020. In fact, December 2020 gave BTC a new all-time high – the first since December 2017. More all-time highs were made in 2021, but by December, it was back to a brutal downtrend for crypto. Here we are one year later, and the chart above does give us some clues about what might happen next. During the two largest bear markets, Bitcoin suffered from Scrooge-like behavior in the crypto industry two Decembers in a row. While we dubbed the second December in the second bear market neutral, it also wasn’t bullish by any stretch. Considering this pattern, this December has a cyclical rhythm that could suggest yet another lump of coal for investors this year. However, when looking at the data alone, there’s roughly a 50/50 chance that this holiday season is something to celebrate across crypto.

42413350,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl8UCS,1671734860,Sam Bankman-Fried Released on $250M Bail Secured by Parents,"A federal judge agreed to release former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried after he appeared in U.S. federal court in New York on Thursday on charges that he was the mastermind behind the fraud and illicit movement of customer funds inside his former crypto empire. The judge set bail at $250 million.  Bankman-Fried, who was brought to the U.S. overnight by the Federal Bureau of Investigation after his extradition from the Bahamas cleared on Wednesday, arrived at the courthouse in New York to face the U.S. felony charges for the first time. The case in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York centers on accusations of fraud, money laundering and campaign-finance violations.  Read more: Bankman-Fried's Incredible Shrinking ‘$250 Million Bond’  Bankman-Fried's release was secured by equity in his parents' Palo Alto, California, home, and a long list of requirements was included for him to remain free while he faces charges. He's not allowed to make financial transactions for more than $1,000, can't open new lines of credit, can't leave the house except to exercise and must go through substance-abuse and mental-health treatment, according to the agreement.  Neither Bankman-Fried nor his parents were required to put up the full amount of the bond. It is sufficient to secure a bond with assets amounting to 10% of the total bond amount. The sky-high personal recognizance bond is meant to reflect the gravity of Bankman-Fried's alleged crimes and deter the former FTX CEO from jumping bail. Still, Bankman-Fried will have to secure the signatures of at least two additional individuals with ""considerable means,"" one of whom cannot be a family member, according to the case's judge. Whether Bankman-Fried has identified two additional signatories remains unclear, but he must do so before a Jan. 5 deadline.  The former CEO arrived at court in a crumpled suit jacket, and the sound of his restraints was audible in the quiet courtroom. When asked if he agreed to the conditions of release, he nodded. The judge then instructed him to answer aloud, and Bankman-Fried looked to one of his lawyers before saying, ""Yes, I do.""  Prosecutors have been closing in on the disgraced crypto frontman, inking plea deals inside the FTX inner circle. Caroline Ellison, the former CEO of FTX’s sister company Alameda Research, and Gary Wang, the other co-founder of FTX, pleaded guilty to federal charges and also admitted guilt in securities violations, according to statements from U.S. prosecutors and regulators late Wednesday.  The cooperation of Ellison and Wang – who admitted playing active roles in the company’s fraud – is likely to be key in the case against Bankman-Fried. They’ve admitted that the senior management was aware of lawbreaking in the movement of customer funds between the two firms.  Bankman-Fried has already given up his passport, and he'll be fitted with a tracking device. His parents have to secure the bail with their home-equity arrangement by Jan. 12.  Judge Gabriel Gorenstein argued that the monitoring device ""would go very far to provide assurance"" that he would stay put and that Bankman-Fried's fame would make it difficult for him to flee into hiding. Also, because his crimes were financial, the federal magistrate judge said it's unlikely he's a threat to anybody, made especially certain by his inability to move money or start a business now.  Ellison’s recently unsealed plea agreement says that as long as she’s helping the SDNY's investigation, as well as any other law enforcement agency involved in the case, she won't face further criminal prosecution apart from potential tax violations. Her bail was set at $250,000, and she has to forfeit her travel documents.  The charges against Bankman-Fried’s FTX cohorts further illuminated the illicit flow of customer money between FTX and Alameda, the trading firm Bankman-Fried also founded, and it described how the senior executives falsely propped up the apparent value of FTT, the exchange’s native token.  Ellison and Wang also settled enforcement actions with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). In the SEC case, it listed FTT as a security – another shot across the bow in the industry’s standoff with the securities regulator.  “Caroline Ellison and Sam Bankman-Fried schemed to manipulate the price of FTT, an exchange crypto security token that was integral to FTX, to prop up the value of their house of cards,” SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in a Wednesday night statement. “Until crypto platforms comply with time-tested securities laws, risks to investors will persist.”  UPDATE (Dec. 22, 2022, 18:56 UTC):Adds details about Bankman-Fried's bail agreement.

The news, tweeted Thursday by M11, came after Orthogonal Trading defaulted on $36 million of loans from M11 Credit-managed lending pools on decentralized finance protocol Maple Finance earlier this month.  M11 Credit and Maple had solicited an ”urgent ex parte application” on Dec. 15 to appoint a provisional liquidator for Orthogonal Trading in British Virgin Islands High Court, according to the tweet. The request was granted, M11 said.  Orthogonal Trading didn’t immediately reply to an email Thursday from CoinDesk seeking comment on the matter.  M11 has said that Orthogonal Trading, which was a borrower and a lending pool manager, misrepresented its losses in the FTX collapse and operated while insolvent for weeks before missing payment. Maple has booted Orthogonal Trading from the platform. Depositors in impacted lending pools are facing up to 80% losses.

Officials with the firm’s own lending unit, Orthogonal Credit, put forth their own Medium post claiming they were kept out of the loop on the depth of Orthogonal Trading’s financial troubles.

42420795,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWYH8v,1671731828,FTX Investors’ Loss Is Wall Street Lawyers’ Gain,"With founder Sam Bankman-Fried in FBI custody, his senior lieutenants cutting deals with prosecutors, and as many as 1 million creditors still waiting to get their money back, there seem to be few winners from the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange.  However, one group is definitely set to gain – the many law firms and consultants that will have to untangle the mess left by Bankman-Fried.  Court filings issued Wednesday detailed the terms under which FTX’s partners will be reimbursed for their efforts. The filings also detail the fees charged by lawyers, tax advisers, restructuring specialists and the company’s own new senior management, including John J. Ray III, who took over from Bankman-Fried as chief executive officer on Nov. 11.  To that list of lawyers can now be added Paul Hastings, hired to be counsel for a representative committee of nine FTX creditors.  Those legal and advisory services don’t come cheap. Sullivan & Cromwell (S&C), FTX’s New York-based law firm, charges as much as $2,165 an hour for work by partners and special counsel, Wednesday court filings show. Appointed to lead the winding up of the company on Nov. 9, S&C received some $3.4 million from FTX in the three months prior to its collapse, most of which was paid on Nov. 3.  West Realm Shires, the subsidiary of FTX that owned the U.S. business, also paid a $12 million retainer at S&C before West Realm filed for bankruptcy on Nov. 14, according to the filings.  Meanwhile, staff at financial advisers Alvarez and Marsel charge an hourly rate of as much as $1,375 and received $4 million in retainers prior to the bankruptcy. Ray, via his company Owl Hill, charges a similar hourly rate. Upon completion of the Chapter 11 bankruptcy plan he will get a further $3 million bonus. Fellow law firm Landis Rath and Cobb, restructuring specialists Kroll, and tax advisers Ernst & Young will all claim their stake, too, according to court filings.  Though amazing to the ordinary person, these numbers are not exceptional in the complex world of bankruptcy proceedings. It is skilled work, with those involved also facing the threat and cost of personal litigation. A job well done could ultimately benefit creditors.  “Sullivan & Cromwell believes that it is essential [for FTX to have] immediate and uninterrupted access” to sophisticated legal advice as they attempt to unwind its affairs, and charges reflect reasonable and competitive compensation, the filings said.  The sums also pale in comparison to the size of the estate. Lawyers and staff are currently trying to safeguard over $1 billion in cash, plus other assets such as cryptocurrency and real estate.  As of the time of FTX’s Chapter 11 filing on Nov. 11, the company’s current management alleges that unauthorized actions led hundreds of millions of dollars to go missing. Though those charges are in dispute, the numbers give some idea of what’s at stake if proceedings aren’t run competently.  Jurisdictional fight  Bahamas Attorney General Ryan Pinder has claimed something untoward has been going on by the U.S. lawyers involved in the bankruptcy. “It is possible that the prospect of multi-million-dollar legal and consultant fees is driving both their legal strategy and the intemperate statements,” Pinder said in a Nov. 27 speech, referring to comments made by new FTX CEO Ray.  For their part, FTX’s lawyers have accused the Bahamas government of seeking to control the entire bankruptcy proceedings, and of having “colluded” with the now-jailed Bankman-Fried. In congressional testimony last week, Ray said his goal is to maximize value for customers and creditors.  A dispute over jurisdiction that spirals into an international incident would spell bad news for those still waiting to get their money back – and will only increase the hefty legal bills.

6172320,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4565981-top-crypto-bear-pick-2023-dogecoin?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,1671731494,Top Crypto Bear Pick For 2023: Dogecoin,"Summary Given Elon Musk's affinity for the meme coin, DOGE bulls are hoping for an integration with Twitter for in-app payments. This is highly unlikely in my view given the recent steps by the company. Lightning tipping has been discontinued. And Twitter has filed paperwork with the US Treasury. Regardless of Twitter, Dogecoin itself has sustained very little mainstream interest and Robinhood user selling appears to be just getting started. The coin remains highly overvalued compared to peers according to NVT, and Dogecoin has less than a third of the on-chain activity of payment peer Litecoin. Since I began covering crypto on Seeking Alpha, I don't think I've made it any mystery that I believe meme coins are terrible investments. In an industry that is filled with scams, grifts, and needless tokens, meme coins stand out as particularly poor instruments for investment capital. I even started a marketplace service because I want to help crypto-interested Seeking Alpha readers 'put the dog money down' and separate the complete junk from the crypto assets that have staying power. Despite only covering it publicly one time, Dogecoin ( DOGE-USD ) has been one of my least favorite cryptos of this cycle. When I last wrote about Dogecoin I highlighted the centralization issue, the fact that it was created as a joke, the lack of a supply cap, the expensive transactions compared to peers, and the low usage among other payment-focused crypto coins. Each of those problems is still evident today. But now we have what I view as more bearish developments that are specific to Dogecoin. This is in addition to a macro environment that still suggests risk-off is the correct approach to portfolio allocation for the time being. Elon Musk and The Twitter Connection Elon Musk's history with Dogecoin has been well documented. The coin has moved in response to his actions and tweets to such a large degree that Musk has actually been sued for his influence over the coin's price action. This by itself should lead any serious crypto advocate to question the investment merits of a coin that can be moved as much as 20% overnight based on one man's tweets. Much of the recent excitement that has manifested in Dogecoin price rallies over the last few weeks is from Musk's plans for integrating payments into Twitter natively. Musk publicly shared slides from a Twitter 2.0 deck that highlighted future initiatives for the company. Among other things, the deck made mention to payments within the application itself. This led to widespread speculation that Dogecoin would be getting some sort of utility within the social media platform. I have serious doubts about any Dogecoin implementation within Twitter natively. Earlier this month we had an apparent leak pertaining to a forthcoming digital asset that was shared by a user on the platform who found a logo for ""Twitter Coin"" in the monetization section of the app's settings. This came after seemingly more concrete evidence of a plan for native Twitter payments with news of a Twitter paperwork filing with the US Treasury last month. The problem for Dogecoin bulls is neither of these is an actual indication that Musk will integrate Dogecoin specifically into the platform. Actually, it looks to be quite the opposite. It appears as though ""Twitter Coin"" may just be an in-app currency that is redeemable for dollars and nothing more. Twitter previously had integrated with Bitcoin's ( BTC-USD ) lightning network for in-app tips but that feature has been discontinued due to inactivity. It turns out after, over a year of integration, the feature amounted to just $8,500 in total tipping volume. For a platform with a 9-figure user base, that's not exactly a ringing endorsement for the crypto-tipping appetite from Twitter's user base even if Dogecoin is somehow integrated. Is The Joke Stale Yet? Dogecoin was created as a joke. It held a top 10 crypto market cap position earlier in its existence and then dropped out of the top 10 for roughly 5 years. If you were a participant in the Wall Street Bets/Meme stock narrative trades during the COVID lockdowns, Dogecoin may have been a natural fit. In many ways, DOGE is a perfect illustration of the financial nihilism movement that can be seen throughout Gen Z. This is because Dogecoin is largely a dunk on money itself. Vincent Ventures supplied terrific coverage of this phenomenon in April of 2021 shortly before DOGE peaked: Behind dogecoin is a rebelliously nihilistic and perhaps dangerous idea that meme money is no more real than actual currency. It may be a joke, but it's a powerful one. The problem for any joke is when it gets played out and I think that's what has happened to DOGE since the crypto market peaked in late 2021. When the government is printing stimmy checks and the bars aren't open, the nihilists have a macro setup that is conducive to throwing money at jokes and memes. Now we are in a very different macro environment where interest rates are rising and the money printing is said to be over. The liquidity that helped drive crypto asset purchases to the moon is gone. There is no money left for jokes with high inflation and worsening economic conditions. In my view, any marginal crypto buyer from here will be allocating to serious ideas that aren't dependent on one man for utility. Worldwide Search Interest Index (Google Trends) In the chart above, we can see the Google ( GOOG ) Trends search interest for Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency broadly, and Dogecoin. In May 2021, search interest in Dogecoin actually surpassed that of Cryptocurrency for a brief period, nearly touching 40. In the last 12 months, DOGE hasn't sniffed its prior trends index highs. If we look to averages over various lengths of time, we can see DOGE benefited from a small interest bounce in late October when Musk closed the Twitter deal: Search Index 90 Days 24 Months 5 Years Bitcoin 41 39 21 Dogecoin 4 6 2 Cryptocurrency 15 16 7 Source: Google Trends, Worldwide Averages But for the most part, interest in Dogecoin is fading, and we can even see that starting to manifest in some of the wallet address data. The chart below shows the DOGE balance held on Robinhood (HOOD) in blue: DOGE on Robinhood (BitInfoCharts) There is no question Dogecoin benefitted as a FOMO-driven meme-coin in early 2021. That FOMO had 45 billion DOGE held on Robinhood during the peak of the Dogecoin madness. It took over a year for DOGE on Robinhood to fall from 45 billion to 40 billion. It has taken less than two months to go from 40 billion DOGE on Robinhood to under 35 billion DOGE as of submission. Since Robinhood traders still hold over 26% of the total coin supply, I believe the selling is only getting started. Valuation & Network Usage For the sake of assigning a real valuation to a coin that exists as a joke, I think we want to compare Dogecoin to both Litecoin ( LTC-USD ) and Bitcoin. Bitcoin and Litecoin are viable comps because like DOGE, they also command a top 20 crypto market cap and are proof-of-work payments-focused crypto coins. They are close siblings. When valuing these types of payments-focused cryptos, the Network Value to Transactions Ratio, or NVT ratio, is a great way to assess when a coin is cheap or expensive. The ratio is calculated by dividing market cap by the dollar-denominated transaction volume on chain. 90 Day Average NVT (CoinMetrics) In the past, the NVT for DOGE has been in-line with Bitcoin and Litecoin; at times it's even been the cheapest. You can see in the divergence in NVT ratio since the crypto market topped in November 2021. The current 90 Day average NVT ratio for Dogecoin is now 107, well ahead of Bitcoin and Litecoin which are at 65 and 49. Dogecoin's highest NVT ratio ever was recorded within the last few weeks. While DOGE's NVT has come back down since, when we compare current levels to the NVT lows we see Dogecoin is still trading at a massive 8.2 multiple against the low. This is well ahead of LTC and BTC. 90 Day Average NVT Current High Low From Low Bitcoin 65 142 20 3.3x Dogecoin 107 278 13 8.2x Litecoin 49 193 15 3.3x Source: CoinMetrics, as of 12/18/22 So not only is Dogecoin still trading at an extremely elevated NVT ratio, but it's doing so when the two other proof-of-work 'OG' cryptos are trading closer to NVT lows rather than NVT highs. This is telling us that Dogecoin is particularly overvalued both compared to its own history and to its peers. The ratio could certainly move lower if there are more transactions that start happening on the blockchain, but I don't think that's very likely. Despite the appearance of a dedicated following behind the coin, DOGE is not a widely held or used cryptocurrency. Total Addresses 24hr Actives Addresses Active % of Total Average TX Fee Bitcoin 43,499,198 783,263 1.80% $0.91 Dogecoin 4,478,166 50,823 1.13% $0.07 Litecoin 6,410,142 250,246 3.90% $0.01 Source: Messari, as of 12/19/22 There are less people holding Dogecoin than holding Litecoin and those who do hold Dogecoin use it less than they use Bitcoin, which has a much higher mean transaction fee. This means Dogecoin simply isn't serving a purpose as a micropayments currency and has less real adoption for larger payments than Litecoin which has a lower market cap and a lower NVT. Dogecoin's valuation is held together by an idea. And it's looking increasingly like the prospects for that idea are dwindling. Risks Memes are actually very powerful. I would never recommend shorting something like Dogecoin because there is no reason it should have a market cap of $10 billion, but it does. There is no reason it should have a market cap of $2 billion, but it is well beyond that. The biggest risk to the bearish Dogecoin view is if it rises with all boats. If the fed pivots and liquidity returns to the risk markets, Dogecoin could theoretically rise. But even after this deep crypto selloff, I would argue that the coin should still fall considerably from current levels even when risk-on inevitably returns. Final Thoughts Dogecoin is an important cryptocurrency for many of the wrong reasons. It was never meant to be taken seriously but it road a massive wave from a fraction of a penny in January of 2021 to over 73 cents just a few months later. In the time since, it has sold off more than 90% but it still could have much lower to go. The coin surged because of Robinhood buyers who now appear to be selling. DOGE has maintained some level of intrigue because of Elon Musk's affinity for the project but after spending billions on Twitter, Musk likely has much bigger concerns at this point than pushing forward a cryptocurrency that is probably only popular because the logo is cute. Like him or not, I don't think it's unfair to say Musk has taken some ill-advised steps in his brief time running Twitter. The company must worry more about appeasing the users and customers of the Twitter platform than the whimsical wishes of a small digital trinket community. Given Twitter's recent decision to discontinue Bitcoin Lightning Network tipping, I think it's far more likely the Twitter team simply uses an internal ledger for fiat-based tipping rather than trying again with a PoW blockchain that isn't exactly cheap to transact on. Crypto Winter isn't over until Dogecoin is back under a penny. I'm sorry, Robinhood kids, but DOGE must die.

Over the last 24 hours, the net flows from exchanges have been seeing a near balance between inflows and outflows. Balancing Each Other Out The exchange net flows reported by Glassnode show barely any difference between the amounts flowing into and out of exchanges. For bitcoin, it recorded $538.6 million worth of BTC flowing into exchanges and $557.4 million flowing out for the same time period. This brought net flows to a measly negative $18.8 million in the 24-hour period. Related Reading: https://newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/microstrategy-bought-bitcoin/ Ethereum was not much different in this regard with $247.8 million in inflows and $245 million in outflows. For the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, net flows were at a positive $2.8 million, showing even less disparity compared to bitcoin. The USDT stablecoin issued by Tether was still very muted in this regard. The $563.6 million in outflows compared to $572.8 million in inflows brought its net flows to a positive $9.2 million.

This is why these top assets are seeing almost identical net flows. The market is still reeling from the contagion of the FTX collapse and traders and investors alike are refusing to take any big bets.

The firm announced his death in a statement Thursday. He was a regular presence on the financial-news cable network CNBC. According to the statement, he had become the public speaker for Guggenheim, along with serving as a senior leader and a mentor.  ""Scott was a key innovator and thought leader who was instrumental in building Guggenheim Investments into the global business it is today,"" CEO Mark Walter said in the statement.  Among investment executives in traditional finance, Minerd was notoriously willing to venture predictions on the bitcoin (BTC) price, some of them quite extreme, and typically with mixed success.  In December 2020, for example, when bitcoin was trading around $20,000, he said that the cryptocurrency ""should be worth around $400,000."" The BTC price climbed to just above $40,000 in January 2021 and peaked around $69,000 late last year.  In May, when bitcoin was around $29,000, he told CNBC it could fall to $8,000. It's now around $16,600.  As recently as last week, he told Bloomberg Television that there was ""another shoe to drop"" from last month's collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX crypto exchange.

6165354,https://newsbtc.com/?p=513378,1671723059,Terra Luna Classic Up 6% On Rumor That Coinbase Is Buying LUNC,"The collapse of Terra Luna and algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD in May was one of the biggest setbacks for the broader crypto market this year. The previously thriving Terra ecosystem was completely wiped out in a matter of days, except for the Terra Luna token, which was resurrected as Terra Luna Classic (LUNC) by the community. Despite losing more than 99% of its value, the cryptocurrency still has one of the most active crypto communities on social media. And from it springs a rumor today that has pumped the price of LUNC by 6%. The rumor says that the second largest exchange in the world by trading volume, Coinbase, might buy the LUNC token in large quantities. Will Coinbase Buy Terra Luna Classic? Within the LUNC community, the news that Coinbase has authorized the purchase of $245 million in LUNC is currently spreading like wildfire. The speculation also indicates that the American exchange will make the news public on January 3, 2023, and provide information about additional LUNC burns. 🚨BREAKING NEWS🚨 Coinbase has just authorized the purchase of 245 million dollars in $LUNC. Internal source says that on the 3rd to announce publicly listing more off-chain burns. — WSB Trader Rocko 🚀🚀🚀 (@traderrocko) December 22, 2022 However, it is important to note that Coinbase has not yet issued an official statement on the matter. The various tweets also do not indicate a source, but merely make the claim based on a supposed source. Who this source of information is, whether it is someone internal, does not seem clear at the moment. Related Reading: Crypto Exchange Binance Dispels FUD Of A ‘Financial Black Box’ However, if the rumor turns out to be true, it could trigger the often-seen “Coinbase effect,” which causes altcoins to rise sharply before a listing on Coinbase. Remarkably, the rumor of a listing of LUNC is not new either. Just two months ago, the Luna Classic community started a petition to list LUNC on Coinbase, as NewsBTC reported. The Terra community wants to follow in the footsteps of the Shiba Inu community, which managed to get the meme coin listed. The Coinbase effect provided SHIB with a short-lived 20% pump. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Recovery Could Soon Fade If BTC Fails To Surpass $17.2K LUNC Price Rises By 6% At press time, the LUNC price stood at $0.00013625, registering a 6% price increase in the last 24 hours. Along with the surge in price, the trading volume of LUNC has also grown noticeably. Within the last 24 hours, it amounted to $90 million, which is 56% higher than the previous day. However, a look at the 4-hour chart reveals that LUNC remains in a deep bearish trading range. The short-lived rally ended just before the crucial resistance at $0.00014138. To set a bullish trend, LUNC needs to cross the trading range of $0.00013787 to $0.00015379. If the rally is short-lived, the support zone at $0.00012612 could be an important mark. Otherwise, the all-time low of LUNC at $0.00012136 would probably be on the table.

42413351,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl8UDO,1671722304,Europe’s Last Bitcoin Mining Refuge Is No Longer Viable,"Bitcoin miners operating in northern Norway and Sweden, where they sought refuge from sky-high electricity prices earlier this year, are powering down for the winter as energy tariffs surge.  Just a few months ago, European miners flocked to the continent’s northernmost regions, which have among the cheapest power prices in the world due to abundant hydroelectric power and low demand, as prices across the continent soared. Some even left for the Americas. Now they’re facing record-high prices – and it is only the start of winter, when demand rises for heating.  December electricity prices in northern Norway have averaged 18 U.S. cents per kilowatt hour (kWh) this year, about four times the average of the previous three years, data from the European power exchange Nordpool shows. In Sweden prices are more than three times as high.  “It was a shocking alignment of events,” which squeezed the only available energy surplus in northern Norway and Sweden, pushing up tariffs, said Denis Rusinovich, co-founder of mining firms CMG Cryptocurrency Mining Group and Maverick Group.  Late November was hit by a combination of low temperatures, which increased the demand for power; a distinct lack of wind that hampered power generation in the U.K., Norway, Sweden and Germany; and delays in scheduled nuclear plant maintenance in France, Sweden and Finland exacerbated by pressure on the supply of natural gas due to the conflict in Ukraine, Rusinovich said.  The resulting jump in prices forced miners to turn off their machines to save on power costs. Some had shut down as early as mid-November, Rusinovich said.  “We assess every day what the hourly prices are and if it's above or below breakeven, then we make a decision whether to switch on or off,” Kjetil Pettersen, CEO of Norway-based Kryptovault, told CoinDesk on Tuesday. “At this moment, our miners are shut off.” Kryptovault relocated to the north of the country earlier this year.  Pettersen said he expects northern Norway power prices to come back down in the first quarter of 2023. Power prices across southern Europe, however, will stay high for 2023, he said.  Miners will remain offline in Europe during the energy crisis as a means of self-preservation, Pettersen said. Whether they can survive without mining revenue depends on their reserve capital and ability to raise more funds, he said.  Also pertinent: their level of debt.  “If you need to reimburse capital, you cannot survive more than a couple of months because you need to repay the debt holders,” said Fiorenzo Manganiello, founder of UAE-based Cowa Energy, who also flagged Iceland as a viable option for mining.  Unsustainable leverage has brought several miners in the U.S. to their knees. Large companies such as Core Scientific (CORZ) and Compute North have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.  Manganiello sees this as an opportunity to buy distressed assets.  Mining sites are currently being sold at an 85%-90% discount, he said. During the bull market, miners were selling facilities, without mining machines, for $1.5 million per megawatt. Today, the figure is closer to $100,000 to $150,000 per MW, he said.

42417085,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcRpOpB,1671720489,The Loyalty Revolution,"We all know loyalty and reward programs. In their simplest form, they are the punch card at your local coffee shop. Buy four and get the fifth one free. In their most complex form, they are an inscrutable and ever-changing formula for earning and redeeming rewards at some of the world’s largest brands in massive industries spanning aviation, hospitality and financial services. The complexity of these programs is so great that countless businesses have cropped up just to help consumers make sense of them.  Loyalty programs are a way for businesses to encourage customer engagement and retention. There’s a common saying that the most profitable sale is one to the customer you already have. It’s more cost-effective to extend an existing customer’s lifetime value than to go out and acquire a new one. This is increasingly true as paid acquisition channels have increased in cost and more of a business’ margin is going to large advertising intermediaries such as Google, Facebook and Instagram.  Tara Fung is the CEO and co-founder of Co:Create. This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's Crypto 2023 series.  But the versions of loyalty programs that we know and love (loathe?) are so limited. They live in walled gardens where the rewards you accrue often offer menial benefits and come with an overwhelming number of restrictions. You can only use these points on select items or at select times, the offering varies, the point-cost fluctuates, points can be devalued from one day to the next, you may be unable to transfer them to someone else (unless you pay exorbitant fees), and don’t even think about being able to monetize and sell the loyalty points you supposedly “earned.”  Because these loyalty programs operate within closed systems, many of them don’t create loyalty as much as captivity.  What is the cost to you as a consumer to “exit” a specific loyalty program and start all over? On the flip side, are you likely to even value the points you’ve earned when you don’t know if you’ll ever reach the membership tiers that unlock relevant benefits?  These switching costs and commitment barriers greatly reduce value to consumers. It begs the question whether these points are ever truly yours to begin with, and if these loyalty micro-economies are a mirage.  However, blockchains make alternative systems possible, where both brands and consumers can share bigger pieces of a larger pie. By tokenizing rewards, customers can own their loyalty, and brands can take advantage of composable technology that enables them to increase lifetime value and lower customer acquisition costs (CAC).  Read more: 2023 Will Be the Year of Dapps – Here's What to Expect | Opinion  So what could this look like?  We have an early view offered by Starbucks’s newly revamped Web3 loyalty program, Odyssey. Individuals in the beta program can now earn tokenized rewards and redeem those rewards within the Starbucks app. Starbucks has shared plans to enable customers to sell those rewards on a Starbucks marketplace. This construct allows customers to own their loyalty in a way they haven’t been able to before.  But for emergent and smaller brands – those focused on achieving growth with limited resources – it’s likely they will be more adventurous. They may be willing to band together to beat the big guys and take on potential risks for the promise of greater outcomes. This is the area that I look forward to most – both as a consumer and someone bullish on blockchain technology – to not only improve our current systems, but create new and better ones.  What if some of these brands were to launch interoperable loyalty programs that provided more value to consumers by enabling points to be utilized across several merchants? This type of system would also allow merchants to strike novel partnerships with non-competitive brands that serve similar customer segments.  In my own life, it’s easy for me to come up with examples of brands I’d love to see partner up, such as:  Allbirds x Cometeer  Soho House x Lululemon  Athletic Greens x Glossier  From these examples, you can likely guess my age, gender and demographic, but that is entirely the point. Personally, I would greatly value the ability to use Soho House credits at Lululemon, and it would undoubtedly result in me spending more across both businesses. The use of earned rewards feels markedly different than if Soho House were to email out a Lululemon discount code. Knowing I’m one of thousands being emailed the same promotion for “15% off” doesn’t hit the same way as being told that the loyalty tokens I’ve earned with one brand can be used with another to unlock rewards, discounts, store credit or limited edition drops.  From the brand’s perspective, it benefits by increasing the value of its own loyalty program. As more uses for the loyalty token are added, the perceived value of them increases, which can draw in more consumers. Additionally, by using a new and open data standard (e.g., ERC-20), brands can agree to and launch these partnerships from one day to another as opposed to spending months developing and implementing data-sharing APIs among proprietary systems.  This isn’t an entirely novel concept. We’ve seen conglomerates launch cross-brand loyalty programs to great success. What is new is the superior and more flexible technology that allows for the multi-merchant programs to be entered into and evolve rapidly, and in doing so take away many of the benefits of scale larger corporations have traditionally enjoyed.  See also: 23 Blockchain Predictions for 2023 | Opinion  Some may worry that tokenizing loyalty exposes a brand’s crown jewels to the world (and direct competitors): their customer data. Currently, the most commonly used blockchains are public blockchains that allow anyone to see transactions and account holdings. This is likely to change as the industry matures, data protection standards are developed, and zero-knowledge technology is advanced. Nonetheless, even now, in its current form, one could argue that the competitive risk presented by tokenizing loyalty is minimal for companies that serve their customers well. In the more well-known cases of vampire attacks, we see that these competitive strategies were often shortlived and minimally successful, with the majority of customers reverting back to the original platform.  Without a doubt, there are many aspects of open loyalty programs that will need solutions, such as mechanisms to regulate healthy supply and demand dynamics so that individuals are not able to disproportionately earn from one merchant and redeem at another. Furthermore, this brave new world is likely to happen incrementally and iteratively versus all at once, beginning with brands using transfer restrictions to address some of these unanswered questions from return on investment (ROI) to regulatory uncertainty.  Nonetheless, this change is coming. Blockchain technology will unlock new opportunities for smaller brands and consumers to share more value among each other rather than allowing that value to be captured by large advertising intermediaries. Progress is relentless, and this is one of the areas we will see it take hold.

42407223,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gUJs2d,1671720314,Brand Building On-Chain: Why Marketers Are Shifting Investment Into Web3,"In 2022, brands spent $297.5 billion on marketing in the U.S. Globally, advertisers spent over $1 trillion. Even with the prospect of recession looming, many marketers expect their budgets to increase in 2023. It’s not getting any easier to reach audiences in Web2. As fast as the digital media landscape has evolved, it’s still fundamentally broken for brands, artists and fan communities.  Brands contend with fragmentation. Today, a typical media mix for a major advertiser includes influencer campaigns, paid social, short-form video, TV ads, email, performance marketing and more. Once you find your community across this fractured ecosystem, your relationship with it is mediated. You’re reliant on third-party platforms and limited by third-party data.  Straith Schreder is the executive creative director at Palm NFT Studio. This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's Crypto 2023 series.  And while digital fan communities have more influence than ever before, they lack the ability and incentive to meaningfully participate in a brand’s story online. You can like a post, but you can never own it.  Web3 offers an alternative. What non-fungible token-based experiences empower, above all else, is connection. You can encode rights in a way that remunerates creators. You can give communities a stake in what they love. You can make pieces that point to what’s possible with art and technology; that live, breathe and react to the moment. Most of all, you can create something that fans see themselves in, whether it’s a generative collection that renders comic canon uniquely personal or an editioned series that makes you confront your own value system.  It’s not surprising, then, that even in the midst of market upheaval, major brands entered the space for the first time in 2022. To date, over 100 brands have launched Web3 projects. Direct-to-avatar sales became a $54 billion market. Nike announced a new home for co-created virtual goods. Starbucks' new loyalty program leverages non-fungible tokens to reward coffee drinkers. And DC’s growing Web3 platform gives collectors the chance to unlock comic books and shape canon.  Read more: Web3 and its Role in Network State Governance - Crypto 2023  As marketers continue to grow their online footprint, NFTs will become the technology standard for digital fan engagement. Just as every brand today needs a social media strategy for reach, every brand tomorrow will need a Web3 strategy for deep, vertical community-building. NFTs will simply become the most natural way we create and share the things we love. Amid a landscape that’s challenged by complexity and speculation, NFTs offer something transformative for brands: connection.  That visceral connection is encoded into every project. Your commitment to fans becomes more than a mission statement. It becomes a contract: shared ownership and space. NFTs will fundamentally change the way marketing works online. From radical customization to community-generated lore, the future of brand-building will begin in Web3.  See also: How Crypto Can Repair Its Reputation in Washington | Opinion  Generative art will center successful brand design  The sustained growth of generative art NFTs will influence the way marketers approach experience design. As generative artist Tyler Hobbs put it: “The value of a collection is around the collector and their contribution.”  Seeing yourself in an artwork is a powerful thing: 78% of consumers are more likely to buy from brands that provide personalized experiences. Generativity will shape the fabric of branded content NFTs, as projects increasingly reflect back the diverse perspectives of the collector communities that participate in them.  Tokens will replace ticketing, on- and offline  From cognac tastings to Comic-Con screenings, NFTs became the entry point into cultural events in 2022. Soon, they’ll be synonymous with live shows. Over five million Ticketmaster NFTs were minted on flow in a six month pilot. But you don’t need an arena tour to integrate token-gating. Closed community experiences will free up space for fans to go deep: creating a new brand channel for distribution, in-world storytelling and impactful discussion.  Every object will have a digital twin  Your suitcase. Your sweater. Your sneakers. Everything you own, actually. Over the past year, a number of projects have explored the space between digital and physical realities. In turn, they’ve created a powerful new lever for onboarding new audiences into Web3: It can’t be just a jpeg if it’s also a literal painting. Emerging brand projects will be visceral; offering objects you can touch through the screen and experiences that mirror the feeling of real-world collecting.  Decentralized storytelling will shift the landscape of IP  From Loot to Knightwatch, story-driven NFT features have gained mainstream traction. As major brands and studios begin to enter Web3, we’ll see creativity enter its multiplayer era. Holder-communities will create and contribute to project lore. Collectors will become protagonists; woven into brand narrative worlds. The stories we love will begin anew.  Frictionless platforms will accelerate adoption  This is a challenging time in crypto. (This is a challenging time, period.) Web3 is at the beginning of its beginning, which means chaos and complexity but also possibility. As major brands enter the space, a door opens behind them. The innovation that we’ll see over the course of the next year will make it frictionless for new fan communities to find their home in Web3.

42407218,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gUJrfU,1671720218,2023 Should Be the Year of On-Chain User Security,"Next year will be a big year for building in “tech crypto.”  While the investment side of crypto (aka “money crypto”) struggles to repair grotesque violations of trust in centralized finance (CeFi), tech crypto must focus even more intently on improving user safety on-chain.  This issue needs to be addressed now more than ever – and thankfully the work has already started. Self-custody and peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions enabled by blockchain is perhaps what crypto is all about. Any work to improve this is a positive trend that will have profoundly beneficial and lasting impacts across the crypto ecosystem.  Bill Hughes is the senior counsel and director of global regulatory matters at ConsenSys Software Inc. This article is part of Crypto 2023.  It can be dangerous on-chain  The lesson to take away from FTX and other CeFi debacles is not just that “this digital asset investment stuff should have been regulated … yesterday.” Instead, it’s that disintermediating transactions using software on global peer-to-peer networks could go a long way to avoid these sorts of failures. In other words, decentralized finance (DeFi) might fix this.  The problem with that argument, of course, is that DeFi’s risk profile looks very different from that of CeFi. For middleman-less finance to take off, protocols must be not only useful but safe. DeFi only “fixes” things if its risk profile is low enough for everyday people to feel safe enough to actually use it.  Today, DeFi users face a host of meaningful threats the tech has yet to catch up to. Bad actors have many attack vectors. And news of splashy exploits and countless scams is causing some to walk away in frustration, fear and, in the worst case, financial ruin. Many more simply never become users due to the difficulties and risks involved.  After system security comes user security  It is famously said that Jeff Bezos’ success with Amazon came down to his realization of one inescapable truth: It’s all about the customer. In 2023, builders must start thinking “it’s all about the user.”  With it being still very early in “tech crypto,” developers have understandably focused squarely on making the technology work. They have made great strides in this regard, with more to come. No one should be criticized for putting the horse before the cart.  However, making the tech work is certainly not the only concern. User experience within the system is meaningfully important, and a big part of that experience is how safe it is. Today, it simply is not safe enough.  See also: What Will 2023 Bring for CBDCs?  Putting aside the fact a technological paradigm shift will require patience and an appetite for trial and error, leaving each user to brave on-chain risks alone will mean almost no one will show up.  Better serve the users  Users need to be better equipped to avoid predators. Scammers deploy malicious smart contracts. They engage in phishing over email, social media posts and direct messages. Some will spoof front-end user interfaces. These threats pose serious challenges.  Fighting these common scams starts with understanding them. User interfaces like MetaMask and other software wallets play a big role here, both by providing insights into the transactions users are engaging in and designing ways to preempt fraud and scams.  A common attack is the “token allowance” attack. This is where a scammer surreptitiously designs a contract so that a user upon executing a transaction involving a small number of tokens actually approves unlimited control over their funds. The owner of the malicious address can then steal the user’s remaining funds. You see very similar attacks targeting non-fungible tokens (NFT).  Right now, wallets and other interfaces are working on better ways to tell users in real time what approvals they are being asked to sign. Companies that focus on anti-phishing and pre-transaction fraud detection will proliferate in 2023 – they have an unmistakable value proposition.  Improving education  Despite the best efforts of the Ethereum community and institutions, the general understanding of how to stay safe in crypto is lackluster. Blogs, Twitter threads, FAQs and other means are a high-effort, low return endeavor. The lessons are normally abstract, voluntary and do not necessarily impact actual behavior.  It’s how and when you educate that is critical to improving safety. Tech crypto builders realize that and are working on ways to supplement general education (which remains important despite its limitations) with mechanisms to better inform users about specific transaction risks in real time.  See also: 23 Blockchain Predictions for 2023 / Opinion  One approach involves using security service providers. These third parties including platforms, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) or even CeFi operators are experts as to the threats targeting their particular communities. The idea is that they gather real-time intelligence about attacks on their communities, which they are already incentivized to collect.  Your favorite platforms could warn you in advance of exposing yourself to a threat. Protocols and apps can design security messages (i.e., pop ups that read something like “what your security provider says about this transaction”), that could inform people before executing a risky transaction. Such systems could prove effective going forward, if people enable their wallets to receive these messages.  Fighting phishing  Social media is a breeding ground for these scammers. Platforms like Twitter should do more to stop these frauds, but tech crypto is also exploring novel ways to help users identify scams in real time.  For example, the teams behind MetaMask and Laconic have partnered on a new initiative to proactively protect users from phishing. This project, called MobyMask, is cultivating a community of reporters who identify and aggregate phishing scams. This information can be built into applications to help prevent users from getting suckered.  Real-world law and order should properly play a role – these scammers are criminals. In fact, phishing operations are growing in scale and complexity and becoming more entwined with international criminal organizations. We should embrace a collaboration between crypto and traditional law enforcement, as plenty of us are sick and tired of simply playing defense.  Improving private key safety  We should see more introspection in 2023 about risks presented by foundational blockchain tech. Some already agree that user safety would increase with improvement to a central feature of the blockchain space: the private key.  Private keys and secret recovery phrases (SRP) have long been a user safety concern, and 2023 will bring more warnings and protections. We will also see further integrations of software wallets with different hardware wallet cold storage solutions, making it harder for criminals to access a victim’s funds.  See also: 10 Predictions for the Future of Crypto in 2023  But tech crypto will build beyond these measures and towards solutions like multi-party computation (MPC). One example of MPC involves multi-factor authentication, specifically entailing a user splitting his key between a local wallet and a signing server. Those shards would work together when a transaction needs signing but would guard against a loss of funds if either is compromised.  You will also see further debate in 2023 about concepts such as “account abstraction.” Described well by Argent wallet and Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, account abstraction involves updating Ethereum itself to essentially make all addresses programmable, not just smart contracts. This would allow for tech crypto to explore more options to safeguard wallets and improve recovery of lost or stolen funds.  The chorus of voices calling for account abstraction development is growing and growing. The arguments for it are only becoming more compelling. That is likely to accelerate in 2023.  Engineering principles really matter  User safety is also directly impacted by how the community of tech crypto developers works and acts. There is a smart, responsible way of engineering blockchain software. Those principles, which include incremental change, auditability and reliability, have been articulated to some extent, but they must be expanded, refined and more broadly embraced.  Services such as smart contract security auditing should be expanded and become more routine, especially where a smart contract has explicit financial applications. Analyses like Solidus Labs’ recent “Rug Pull Report” and other sober assessments of on-chain scams are also sorely needed if the ecosystem is going to make honest assessments of its progress.  Lastly, the community should also think seriously about whether to simply laugh off incidents where a developer hurts users through negligence or fraud.  Money crypto should incentivize best practices  Venture capital and other investors not hibernating through this crypto winter should seek out projects that prioritize user safety to invest in. That is, if they’re truly “in it for the tech.” It could be a sound investment strategy: Utility plus safety equals adoption.  Money crypto should apply a due diligence checklist for things like responsible development principles, audits and code transparency. Requiring these elements as table stakes for making an investment not only will help identify good founders and projects, good founders who are focusing on safety, but also incentivize markets towards more sustainable and safer building practices.  Regulators will address user safety if builders do not  The final, and perhaps most important point is that if we do not prioritize safety, then regulators will on our behalf. Few things are more certain.  In 2023, we will start to see greater movement out of consumer protection policymakers. They will first attend to CeFi, because that is where the fire currently is. Then, if people are still getting hurt frequently enough in the P2P space, regulators will determine what rules are needed to better protect P2P network users.  See also: Adoption of DeFi, ZK Tech, NFTs and More Will Continue to Increase in 2023  Perhaps those rules will apply only to for-profit software developers. Perhaps regulators will simply say “it’s all too dangerous” and accordingly write rules directly restricting users. We don’t know, necessarily. But we do know, it bears emphasizing: If user safety does not meaningfully improve as adoption increases, then P2P programmable networks and the apps on them will be regulated by investor and/or consumer protection authorities.  This is concerning both because regulators are unlikely to know how to help without materially degrading innovation or user choice, and because consumer protection enforcers, state Attorneys General in particular, have incredibly broad powers to hold service providers and product developers accountable for user injuries. It is far better to get tech crypto’s house in order than to let regulators do it.  The P2P ecosystem will flourish if it is safe enough for everyday people to use. It’s simply not there yet, but we can get there. Those builders that make user safety a priority in 2023 will help build that space which sees the most dramatic adoption. And those builders will be the leaders in it.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Bill Hughes,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/12/22/2023-should-be-the-year-of-on-chain-user-security,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a7d83b776819418c2d569a5398bfd2acb20c482f-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

MVRV Triple Ribbon Approaches Bearish Cross,"On-chain data shows the Bitcoin MVRV Ratio Triple Ribbon is approaching a bearish cross, a sign that a correction could be coming soon for the crypto’s price. Bitcoin MVRV Ratio Triple Ribbon Is Close To Bearish Crossover As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the MVRV ratio warns that a new round of decline may be coming for BTC. The “MVRV ratio” is an indicator that measures the ratio between the market cap of Bitcoin and its realized cap. The realized cap is a capitalization model for BTC that calculates a sort of “real value” for the asset by assuming that the true worth of each coin in circulation is the price at which the particular coin was last moved. Related Reading: XRP Accumulation: Key Sharks And Whales Group Hits All-Time High Holdings By comparing this realized cap with the market cap, the indicator tells us whether the coin’s actual price is fair or not right now. Here is a chart that shows the trend in three moving averages (10-day, 15-day, and 20-day) of this metric over the last few months: The three MAs seem to have been closing in on each other in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant These three MAs of the Bitcoin MVRV Ratio together form the “Triple Ribbon” indicator, and crossovers between these ribbons have historically had implications for the price of the asset. As you can see in the above graph, whenever the 10-day MA has passed below both the 15-day and the 20-day versions, while at the same time the 20-day has gone above both the others (thus keeping the 15-day’s position unchanged in the middle), a bearish crossover has formed for BTC. There have been two instances of such a cross during the last few months; the first one occurred back in August when Bitcoin was at the height of its first relief rally of this bear market, while the other one formed in November right as the FTX crash came around. In both of these occurrences, BTC’s price took a deep plunge following the cross formation. Related Reading: Altcoin Indexes Take Beating As Investors Flip Alts For Bitcoin From the chart, it’s apparent that the MVRV Ratio Triple Ribbon has once again been approaching this same kind of bearish crossover recently.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Top Stories  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has called FTX’s FTT exchange token a security. FTT was sold as an investment contract and is a ""security,"" the SEC said in a complaint filed late Wednesday, in a move that is sure to have a wide-ranging impact on the industry. ""If demand for trading on the FTX platform increased, demand for the FTT token could increase, such that any price increase in FTT would benefit holders of FTT equally and in direct proportion to their FTT holdings,"" the SEC wrote in its complaint.  Former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison and FTX co-founder Gary Wang have pleaded guilty to criminal fraud charges tied to FTX's collapse. The SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission also announced charges against the two, saying Ellison manipulated the price of FTT. The duo are cooperating with investigators. The U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York did not specify what they were being charged with.  Twitter has integrated cryptocurrency prices into search results using a plug-in from charting platform TradingView. The integration allows users to type crypto or stock tickers into the search bar to generate the current value and a price chart. The result also includes a link to trading app Robinhood. The social media giant has had several ties to the crypto industry over the past few years, adding a tipping feature in September 2021 while the company was under the management of Jack Dorsey. Since then, Twitter has been taken over by Elon Musk.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the number of daily active bitcoin addresses since January 2020. The metric filters out addresses with unsuccessful transactions.  The average number of daily active addresses (DAA) this year has been 921,445 – a 16% drop from the 2021 average of 1.1 million.  ""Aside from the decline in trading volumes, the fall in DAA could also correspond to reduced mining operations as miners' activity corresponds to BTC's most significant on-chain movements,"" the Dec. 12 issue of Bitfinex's Alpha report said.  The greater the active user participation on the blockchain, the higher the demand for and the price of the cryptocurrency.

42411285,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMfxz,1671716981,The CFP Board’s Latest Report on Crypto Sets High Standards for Advisors,"The Certified Financial Planner (CFP) Board dropped its “Notice to CFP Professionals Regarding Financial Advice about Cryptocurrency-related Assets” on Dec. 5.  The board's notice is a 14-page report that outlines a series of risks associated with cryptocurrency investment. It lays out some standards that financial advisors can adhere to in their decision to provide, or not provide, advice on cryptocurrency investment.  By the CFP Board’s definition, this advice includes “communications that, based on their content, context and presentation, would reasonably be viewed as a recommendation to take or refrain from taking a particular course of action.”  You're reading Crypto for Advisors, a weekly look at digital assets and the future of finance for financial advisors. Subscribe here to receive the mailing every Thursday.  In short, the report elucidates the CFP Board’s “Code and Standards,” which neither prohibits advisors from giving advice on crypto nor inhibits them from not giving any advice on it. It emphasizes that financial advisors must adhere to Fiduciary Duty when giving advice on crypto by fully taking into account the goals, risk tolerances and personal/financial circumstances of the client. And it underscores the standards of competency necessary in giving crypto-related advice.  On giving versus not giving advice  The report does spell out, “The CFP Board’s Code and Standards does not require a CFP professional to offer Financial Advice to a Client on every Financial Asset that is available in the marketplace. A CFP professional does not violate the Code and Standards when the CFP professional does not provide Financial Advice about cryptocurrency-related assets.”  However, the CFP Board’s precaution on advice giving should be interpreted to mean that crypto-uneducated financial advisors should not only avoid giving advice in support of cryptocurrency, but also giving advice in opposition to it.  Financial advisors uneducated about crypto can no longer legitimately argue that cryptocurrencies are “Ponzi,” “beanie babies” or “tulips,” as all of those characterizations are not founded in facts or research. The statements might work over a beer with friends but not in financial planning with clients. In such settings, misrepresenting bitcoin is a form of advice – and there are far too many advisors currently in this camp.  Read more: Worse Than Tulip Mania? Common Misconceptions About Crypto Assets  On responsibilities to clients  The notice mentions, “A CFP professional must satisfy the Fiduciary Duty, which provides that a CFP professional must act as a fiduciary, and therefore, act in the client's best interests, at all times when providing Financial Advice to a Client.”  This means that if you as a financial advisor feel it is irresponsible and not logical for your client to invest in crypto, then you should advise against it.  That said, I have not seen a single advisor make a specific and compelling case against an allocation to bitcoin. Whereas mathematics favors adding bitcoin, FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) most often gets in the way.  Bitcoin is not going to disappear because the FTX crypto exchange was allegedly a criminal enterprise. Bitcoin will remain around for generations to come because bitcoin is money, helps small business owners and helps solves ESG concerns.  Not only that, information on how to more intelligently gain exposure to a variety of crypto assets is now available. The Digital Asset Classification Standard (DACS), created by CoinDesk Indices, provides reliable, comprehensive and standardized industry definitions and classifications for digital assets.  Read more: Introducing CoinDesk Indices' Digital Asset Classification Standard  On competency  It is wholly and entirely up to each advisor to refrain from providing advice.  But the report explains that “A CFP Professional Must Comply with the Duty of Competence When Providing Financial Advice About Cryptocurrency-Related Assets.”  I don’t have an opinion on every esoteric investment strategy – and you don’t need to either. But it’s important that, as advisors, we be honest with clients when there is an area of investment that we are not fully educated on.  Most advisors’ commentary on crypto should be, “I haven’t done the work to provide any analysis on it.” In my opinion, this applies to 90%+ of all advisors.  That said, cryptocurrency has gone mainstream, so there is less and less room for excuses on why you haven’t spent time researching this growing asset class. CNBC even has bitcoin listed on its ticker tape – so clients of all ages are seeing it and hearing about it and they’re going to be asking you questions about it.  I recommend that in 2023 you commit yourself to becoming more educated about cryptocurrency as a financial advisor. Fortunately, there are some great resources to do that.  For books, I recommend reading ""The Bitcoin Standard,"" ""The Price of Tomorrow: Why Deflation Is the Key to an Abundant Future,"" ""The Bullish Case for Bitcoin"" and ""Inventing Bitcoin: The Technology Behind The First Truly Scarce and Decentralized Money Explained.""  For podcasts, check out ""Bitcoin Fundamentals"" and ""Bitcoin Audible.""  And finally, this blog post here is great: ""Gradually, Then Suddenly.""  Expand your network  As an advisor, know there are peers out there that can and will help you learn. There will be and are advisors focused on gathering knowledge and helping clients navigate bitcoin.  I’ve been fortunate to connect with other advisors and recently helped start the Bitcoin Financial Advisors Network. But be prepared. People at such events might ask hard questions and encourage you to dig deeper into preconceived notions.  It’s time we as a financial industry hold ourselves to a higher standard when talking about bitcoin with clients, given that as a CFP you are allowed to discuss and recommend it.  The key is getting educated because you are not protecting clients from bitcoin by not learning about it. Taking personal responsibility to educate yourself cannot be overstated in crypto. As they say, “Don’t Trust, Verify.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Isaiah Douglass,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/12/22/the-cfp-boards-latest-report-on-crypto-sets-high-standards-for-advisors,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4ecc5f767ed57c32de6041479fd34805f422ff20-6000x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Here’s a quick glance of how the crypto has been performing of late: TRX price up by 0.20% as of this writing Technical indicators show increased TRX demand TRON second in line in terms of TVL Tron Price Retraces By Half According to CoinMarketCap, TRX price has spiked by 0.20% or is trading at .05529 as of this writing. TRON has tested the key support level of $0.54 several times this month. TRX price has also retraced by 50% or currently at the $0.0578 level as the coin retreated from 0.066 to $0.047. Related Reading: VeChain Jumps By 4% As VET Investors Look To Profit Before Christmas Source: TradingView The Visible Range Volume Profile looked promising too as it showcased the point of control which is at the $0.055 level and with the value area high seen at $0.059. On November 26, TRON retested the key support level of $0.0527. The bullish breaker can be spotted right below this level extending from $0.0527 to $0.0516. Evidently, the price has tried to retest the bullish breaker several times, seeing a visible reaction on every retest performed. TRON has recently disclosed they are second in line in terms of Total Value Locked (TVL), trailing behind Ethereum. It also demonstrated an impressive burn rate which only supports the premise of TRON’s accelerating growth. TRX total market cap at $5 billion on the daily chart | Chart: TradingView.com The frequent retests done on the bullish breakers as well as the higher lows has triggered the formation of a right-angled pattern which could be signaling a breakout northwards on price. On the other hand, Bitcoin is trying to barrel past the mounting pressure experienced at the $17k-$17.4k, which hints that a pullback could give the bulls an opening to go and buy TRX. Related Reading: Why Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Seem To Be Losing Interest In BTC Source: TradingView Tron OBV On The Rise TRX is now being supported, but is failing to make any notable chart moves. Instead, price action is continuing to move sideways within the pennant that formed. Meanwhile, a further rejection would send the TRX price action back down, where it would then attempt to test the support provided by the the ascending trendline. Source: TradingView Should that level be breached, bearish follow-through trading towards $0.051 can be anticipated. Since November, it has been observed that TRON’s on-balance volume has been rapidly increasing, which demonstrates an exceptionally high level of buying pressure. In this case, although the formation of the right-angled pattern hints at an upward breakout, there seems to be another scenario as shown in the flat open interest chart.

The securities regulator is concerned specifically about crypto firms' proof of reserves, which allow centralized exchanges, through an independent audit conducted by a third party, to showcase their solvency as well as the value of their reserves. Those reports have gained tremendous popularity following last month's implosion of crypto exchange FTX ( FTT-USD ) that was partly triggered by its shortage in internal controls, thus added to the risk of inaccurate financial statements. Crypto exchange Crypto.com, for instance, indicated on November 11 that around 20% of its ~$2.82B in total assets were in meme coin Shiba Inu ( SHIB-USD ). French auditor Mazars, which recently verified Binance's PoR among other trading platforms, reportedly decided last week to suspend its proof-of-reserves reporting for crypto clients earlier this month due to a lack of confidence in such disclosures. All in all, “Investors should not place too much confidence in the mere fact a company says it’s got a proof of reserves from an audit firm,” Munter to The WSJ . The reports ""lack information for an investor to assess whether the company has sufficient assets to cover its liabilities.” Earlier this month, (Dec. 8) SEC advised public firms to disclose exposure to crypto turmoil .",NEGATIVE,SHIB,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | SHIB | BNB,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/news/3919782-sec-increases-scrutiny-of-crypto-firms-audited-proof-of-reserves-report?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/6159842.jpeg

42413342,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl8U5u,1671713331,FTX Creditors Hire Law Firm Paul Hastings as Representation,"Paul Hastings LLP has been tapped to represent FTX creditors in the crypto exchange's bankruptcy proceedings, the law firm told CoinDesk on Thursday.  A court document filed on the same day shows the New York law firm, along with Delaware-based Young Conaway Stargatt & Taylor LLP, will be handling ""all papers served or required to be served,"" in the bankruptcy case on behalf of creditors.  A creditor committee chose Paul Hastings from among a number of firms that pitched for the role, The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter. The report added that the process to select a financial adviser is ongoing. The creditors' committee was formed last Thursday.  As the collapsed global crypto exchange's bankruptcy proceedings continue in the U.S., what remains of the company is attempting to gather over $1 billion in cash assets scattered across the globe.  At a meeting of FTX creditors held Tuesday, U.S. Trustee Juliet Sarkessian urged creditors looking to secure their representation in the case to reach out to the committee's counsel once formally in place.  ""They can be contacted,"" said Sarkessian, a U.S Department of Justice official charged with overseeing bankruptcy cases, of the lawyers that were yet to be appointed. ""They do not represent you [the creditors] personally. They may be able to provide some help though, and they may even create their own website potentially for information for creditors.""  On Wednesday, FTX's disgraced founder Sam Bankman-Fried was set to be extradited from the Bahamas to the U.S. to face criminal charges. Meanwhile, two executives in his inner circle, Caroline Ellison and Gary Wang, agreed to a plea deal with the Justice Department.

42413363,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl8UNg,1671713292,Crypto Market May See Renewed Volatility as Whales Begin to Accumulate Bitcoin,"The crypto market has recently held steady, with bitcoin locked in the narrow range of $16,000 to $18,000 amid lingering macroeconomic uncertainty and FTX contagion fears.  The perplexing tranquility may soon fade because bitcoin's historical volatility hits levels last seen before the late 2020 bull run and investors with ample capital supply begin to accumulate coins.  ""The quiet price action of the past month is illustrated by [bitcoin's] low realized volatility. Not counting the moment leading up to the FTX fallout, which had slightly higher volatility than what we have now, this is the lowest level for realized volatility since the third quarter of 2020, just before the last bull run. Prior to that instance, volatility was this low at the bottom of the 2018 bear market,"" Blockware's weekly report said.  ""Calm waters do not last long in bitcoin, so be prepared for a sharp move here shortly,"" the report added.  Realized volatility refers to the magnitude of daily price movements, irrespective of direction, over a specific period. It's a backward-looking metric, while the implied volatility is forward-looking, revealing options traders' expectations for price turbulence over the coming week/month.  Bitcoin's annualized one-month realized volatility fell to a two-year low of 38% last week.  ""Investors should prepare for another swift move soon because smooth sailing does not endure in the crypto market for long,"" the Dec. 12 issue of Bitfinex's Alpha report said, referring to the ultra-low realized volatility.  The report added that an uptick in implied volatility with an extended period of low realized volatility is followed by wild price fluctuations.  At press time, short-term and long-term implied volatility metrics remain depressed in line with the realized volatility. The low implied volatility means the market is not forecasting a big move.  The situation, however, could change after the holiday season, with traders snapping up options and pushing implied volatility higher relative to historical volatility.  Signs of whale accumulation  The renewed accumulation of BTC by whales, or investors with ample capital supply and the ability to move markets, is another reason to expect some action in the market.  Large wallets have accumulated over 400,000 BTC ($6.73 billion) since the cryptocurrency fell below the June low of $18,000 on Nov. 9, Bitfinex report noted, quoting data from on-chain analytics platform Whalemap.  The white line is bitcoin's daily close price (UTC), and the bubbles' size represents the number of coins accumulated by the whale wallets.  ""Over the past week, large or 'whale-styled' wallets have experienced an inflow of over 70,000 BTC. Around 120K BTC was accumulated at the $16,100 level, which offers potential support given the scale of buying,"" Bitfinex said.""

6154760,https://newsbtc.com/?p=513362,1671708617,Crypto Exchange Binance Dispels FUD Of A ‘Financial Black Box’,"In addition to the macroeconomic headwinds, the Binance rumors and the uncertainty surrounding Grayscale/DCG are clouding the sentiment in the Bitcoin market. In a renewed attempt to dispel the “FUD,” Binance released a detailed report today in which the world’s largest crypto exchange addresses current questions from the media and the community. Even though analytics firms like CryptoQuant and Nansen recently confirmed the existence of customer funds on-chain, one of the biggest accusations against Binance at the moment is that it is a “financial black box”. Critics claim that the exchange led by Changpeng Zhao is refusing to disclose financial information. The exchange counters these charges in its statement. It says that it does not have to disclose a detailed financial status for two reasons: first, it is not a publicly traded company; second, Binance is financially autarchic and doesn’t need external funding. In addition, it has no “intention to go public at this time.” In addition, Binance discloses “operational and financial information” in the countries where it operates, to the extent necessary, as “required by local regulators.” The exchange further added that “In some cases, the disclosure process takes up to six months due to the sheer volume of information.” Further, Binance says that its capital structure is debt-free, can cover all ongoing costs with revenue, and keeps assets fully separated. Related Reading: Binance Controversy Continues As Experts Warn Of Serious Fallouts Due To FUD “Based on the principles of ‘customer first’ and ‘openness and transparency’, Binance will continue to promote asset reserve verification on the chain to make it easier for the outside world to query and verify user asset storage,” the statement elaborates. Other Binance “FUD” A major argument against Binance’s integrity has also been the recent resignation of accountant Mazar and the question of why the company does not hire a “Big Four” auditor. As the statement reiterates, Mazars withdrew from all crypto companies, not just Binance. Regarding the audit by a “Big Four” auditing firm, the exchange clarifies that they have not worked with any crypto company to verify on-chain reserves so far. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Recovery Could Soon Fade If BTC Fails To Surpass $17.2K As for Coinbase’s collaboration with Deloitte, Binance says it is important to distinguish that the audit is aimed at the financial status of the listed company, not the verification of on-chain reserves. On-chain verification of encrypted corporate reserves is a very new field. At present, we are still actively communicating with companies willing to provide verification services for encrypted companies, and will share the latest progress with you soon. In addition, the exchange sets the record straight that the verification of Bitcoin reserves is just the first step, and on-chain proof of reserves of some mainstream currencies will follow “as soon as possible.” Bitcoin Price Eyes $16,900 Confronted with the uncertainty and massive levels of FUD swirling the market, the Bitcoin price is currently holding critical levels of support, although a retest of $16,600 does not seem out of the question. If BTC manages to break through the tenacious resistance of $16,900, a continuation into the zone up to $17,500 could be conceivable.

With this scenario, if the buying pressure persists, VET could sprint towards its resistance level and supply zone at the 100% Fibonacci level found at $0.01967. VeChain investors could profit at $0.01778 A breach slicing below the $0.0156 mark can further invalidate the bullish streak of VET VET showing price recovery at $0.01583 VeChain has recently launched its upgrade PoA 2.0 and its Relative Strength Index (RSI) has shown an intense uptick after its breakaway from the oversold zone. This goes to show how the buying pressure has magnified over time. Related Reading: Why Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Seem To Be Losing Interest In BTC Chart: TradingView VeChain: On Fraud And High Gas Fees According to Analytics Insight, “VeChain (VET) was first conceived of by Sunny Lu, the former CTO of Louis Vuitton, someone who knows first-hand about the problems involved in tracking and proving genuine vs counterfeit goods.” As such, VeChain is known to be a first-of-its-kind layer 1 blockchain that aims to bring to the table innovative solutions to ultimately solve real-world problems such as the high transaction fees and counterfeiting which is deemed to be extremely beneficial for enabling friction-less transaction and also for the hassle-free minting of NFTs. VET’s On-Balance Volume (OBV) has also recorded an uptick which demonstrates the spike in trading volume and buying pressure. In the event that this trend lingers on, VeChain could eventually reach its profit target at $0.01968. Investors are optimistic to take in profits just before Christmas.

In this case, risk-averse investors will resort to lock in their profit at the $0.01776 resistance zone. This means a breach below $0.01564 would invalidate any bullish streak and could toss VeChain back into the new support zone found at $0.01470. VET has also seemed to have noted a remarkable rise in development activity since middle of this month. This goes to show that developers have their full trust on VeChain’s future innovations.

The leading cryptocurrency by market value tends to lead major stock market bottoms by at least six weeks, analysis of past data by Delphi Digital shows.  ""History shows that, on average, BTC has topped ~48 days and bottomed ~10 days before the SPX [S&P 500],"" Delphi's strategists, led by Kevin Kelly, wrote in a 2023 preview sent to clients on Wednesday. ""Over the past five years, all major price reversals in BTC have preceded those in major equity indices.""  It shows bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, in general, are looked upon by investors as more risky assets than stocks. As Brookings Institutions' Eswar Prasad noted last year, bitcoin has become a speculative investment.  While corporate fundamentals and macroeconomic factors directly impact stocks, the crypto market is yet to develop strong links with the global economy. Digital assets, until now, have proved to be narrative-driven, with valuations almost entirely dependent on the pace of expansion in fiat currency supply, mainly the U.S. dollar and factors like inflation rate that influence the Federal Reserve policy.  ""The crypto market is one of the purest bets on global liquidity expansion and currency debasement. Not only is it influenced by macro factors, but when market conditions change, it’s often the first to react,"" Delphi's strategists noted.  Bitcoin peaked at $69,000 on Nov. 11, 2021, or 55 days before the S&P 500 topped out at 4,818 on Jan. 4. The index's early 2018 top came 42 days after BTC's bull run ran out of steam near $20,000.

She will also need to pay restitution of an amount determined by the court.  The plea agreement was first obtained by New York's Inner City Press, a publication that covers court proceedings in the city's federal court.  The agreement states that if Ellison fully cooperates with the SDNY's investigation, as well as any other law enforcement agency designated by the office, she won't be further prosecuted criminally except for possible criminal tax violations with regard to the wire and commodity fraud charges that resulted from commingling funds between FTX and Alameda accounts. The deal does not guarantee that other agencies will not pursue prosecution at a later date.  A court would need to agree to the plea deal for it to be in effect.  A paragraph of the document has been redacted, removing information about some of the possible charges.  Ellison will be permitted bail, provided she can provide a $250,000 personal recognizance bond and restrict travel to the continental United States. She will also need to surrender any travel documents she has.  The plea deal also contains language that says if Ellison is not a U.S. citizen, it is very likely that her removal from the U.S. will be mandatory. It is assumed that Ellison is a U.S. national, but it is unclear if she might have abandoned her nationality for a citizenship of convenience for tax reasons, which is a popular trend among some crypto traders living abroad, as the U.S. taxes non-residents.

""If demand for trading on the FTX platform increased, demand for the FTT token could increase, such that any price increase in FTT would benefit holders of FTT equally and in direct proportion to their FTT holdings,"" the SEC wrote in its complaint. ""The large allocation of tokens to FTX incentivized the FTX management team to take steps to attract more users onto the trading platform and, therefore, increase demand for, and increase the trading price of, the FTT token.""  The SEC made the claim in a complaint filed against FTX co-founder Gary Wang and former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison.  In the complaint, it highlighted that FTX would use proceeds from the token sale to fund the development, marketing, business operations and growth of FTX while using language to emphasize that FTT is an ""investment"" with profit potential.  ""The FTT materials made clear that FTX’s core management team’s efforts would drive the growth and ultimate success of FTX,"" the complaint read.  FTT's ""buy-and-burn"" program was also mentioned. This initiative, used by many other exchange tokens, is akin to a stock buyback where revenue from FTX would repurchase and burn FTT, thus increasing its value.  Ellison and Wang have both pled guilty to the various charges brought before them, and are not contesting the SEC's allegations, the agency said in a press release.  The two are also facing Justice Department and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) charges related to their conduct at FTX and Alameda, respectively. ""FTT investors had a reasonable expectation of profiting from FTX’s efforts to deploy investor funds to create a use for FTT and bring demand and value to their common enterprise."" the SEC added.

In a Wednesday night statement posted on Twitter , US Attorney for the Southern District of New York Damian Williams said that the duo were charged due to ""their roles in the fraud that contributed to FTX's collapse."" Ellison and Wang are also cooperating with the Southern District as the feds build their case against Bankman-Fried. Williams also sent a warning to others.

BTC remains at a risk of a fresh decline unless there is a clear move above the $17,200 resistance zone. Bitcoin is facing a strong resistance near $17,000 and $17,200. The price is trading above $16,800 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. There is a new declining channel forming with resistance near $16,900 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could attempt a recovery wave if there is a clear move above the $17,200 resistance zone. Bitcoin Price Struggle Continues Bitcoin price started an upside correction from the $16,250 zone. BTC managed to recover a few points and was able to settle above the $16,600 level. There was a clear move above the $16,800 resistance and the 100 hourly simple moving average. The price even attempted an increase above the $17,000 resistance, but the bears were active. A high was formed near $17,067 and the price is consolidating in a range. There was a minor decline below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $16,261 swing low to $17,067 high. Bitcoin price is now trading above $16,800 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. On the upside, an immediate resistance is near the $16,900 zone. There is also a new declining channel forming with resistance near $16,900 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. The first major resistance is near the $17,000 zone. Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com The main hurdle seems to be forming near the $17,200 and $17,250 levels. A clear move above the $17,250 resistance might call for a move towards the $17,500 resistance. The next major resistance is near $18,000, above which the price climb towards the $18,450 resistance zone. Fresh Drop in BTC? If bitcoin fails to clear the $17,200 resistance, there could be a fresh drop. An immediate support on the downside is near the $16,700 level and the channel trend line. The next major support is near the $16,625 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $16,261 swing low to $17,067 high. A downside break below the $16,625 support might call for a move towards the $16,370 level. Any more losses might send the price towards $16,000.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) also announced charges against the two, saying Ellison manipulated the price of FTT, an exchange token issued by FTX, at exchange founder Sam Bankman-Fried’s direction.  The duo are cooperating with investigators, Williams announced. The U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) did not specify what they were being charged with. Court records were not immediately available.  FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was charged with eight crimes by the SDNY earlier this month after he was arrested in Nassau. The charges include money laundering, wire fraud, securities fraud and campaign finance violations. He is being extradited to the U.S., Williams confirmed in his statement, saying the FTX founder was in FBI custody and would appear in court ""as soon as possible.""  Read more: Bankman-Fried’s Cabal of Roommates in the Bahamas Ran His Crypto Empire – and Dated. Other Employees Have Lots of Questions  In a statement, SEC Deputy Enforcement Director Sanjay Wadhwa said the three “were active participants in a scheme to conceal material information from FTX investors, including through the efforts of Mr. Bankman-Fried and Ms. Ellison to artificially prop up the value of FTT, which served as collateral for undisclosed loans that Alameda took out from FTX pursuant to its undisclosed, and virtually unlimited, line of credit.""  Highlighted in the complaint are multiple times when Bankman-Fried made public statements, and provided investors with documentation via audited financial statements, that Alameda received no preferential treatment from FTX.  ""Given their involvement in the fraudulent scheme outlined herein, Defendants knew or were reckless in not knowing that these statements to investors were false and misleading and that they were important to FTX’s investors,"" the complaint reads.  ""By surreptitiously siphoning FTX’s customer funds onto the books of Alameda, defendants hid the very real risks that FTX’s investors and customers faced,” added Wadha in a press release.  Ellison was a close confidant of Bankman-Fried's, and has been targeted by prosecutors for her role in manipulating FTX's exchange token FTT, which Alameda had used as collateral for investments. In early December Ellison, who is thought to reside in Hong Kong or Nassau, was spotted in Manhattan at a coffee shop leading many to suspect she was working with authorities.  Read more: Sam Bankman-Fried Is Being Extradited Wednesday, Bahamas Attorney General Says  Shortly after, Ellison retained the law firm WilmerHale to represent herself. WilmerHale counts Stephanie Avakian, a former director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement, as one of its top attorneys.  FTX came under pressure after the CEO of crypto exchange Binance on Nov. 6 said he planned to sell his remaining holdings of FTX’s FTT token.  The SEC case noted that Ellison tweeted an offer to buy Binance's entire stake of FTT for $22, at the direction of Bankman-Fried. Other tweets from Ellison about the integrity of Alameda's balance sheet, in a response to a CoinDesk article, were also at the behest of Bankman-Fried, the complaint said.  ""If you participated in misconduct at FTX or Alameda, now is the time to get ahead of it. We are moving quickly and our patience is not eternal,"" Williams said.  For its part, the CFTC made similar allegations against Wang and Ellison, saying Ellison committed fraud and made “material misrepresentations” tied to the FTT sales, while alleging Wang “allowed Alameda to maintain an essentially unlimited line of credit on FTX.”  UPDATE (Dec. 22, 2022, 04:39 UTC): Adds additional information throughout.

Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: The action was in Popsicle's ICE token against mostly flat trading for crypto markets including bitcoin.  Insights: Crypto has yet to cause a fiat financial crisis. So why is there talk of banning it? asks Sam Reynolds.  Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 794.82 −3.3 ▼ 0.4% Bitcoin (BTC) $16,843 +1.2 ▲ 0.0% Ethereum (ETH) $1,216 +7.1 ▲ 0.6% S&P 500 daily close  3,878.44 +56.8 ▲ 1.5% Gold  $1,825 +9.4 ▲ 0.5% Treasury Yield 10 Years  3.68% ▲ 0.0 BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices; gold is COMEX spot price. Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  The heat is elsewhere as bitcoin hibernates  By Brad Keoun  Cryptocurrencies were barely budging in early Asia hours, even after a decent day of gains in U.S. stocks on Wednesday.  The benchmark CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) of digital assets was down 0.3% over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin was trading flat, just above $16,800.  ""Bitcoin isn't getting much of a boost from the positive risk-on environment that is running through Wall Street,"" Edward Moya, senior market analyst at the foreign-exchange brokerage Oanda, wrote Wednesday in a note.  The hot action was in the decentralized finance (DeFI) protocol Popsicle Finance's ICE token, which tripled over the past 24 hours after the controversial yet prolific blockchain developer Daniele Sestagalli said he was returning to the project after a hiatus.  Insights  Crypto has yet to cause a fiat financial crisis. Why the talk of bans?  By Sam Reynolds  Without a doubt, the digital asset industry is in the depths of a market that looks a lot like 2008. One could even say that the elaborate DeFi protocols with questionable collateralization accelerated the market decline, in the same way that exotic derivative vehicles like collateralized debt obligations (CDO) made the 2008 crisis worse.  But the damage is limited to crypto. There’s no evidence to suggest that some form of contagion has materialized that has spread over to the TradFi markets. Certainly, macroeconomic factors like interest rates and the strength of the dollar have impacted crypto, but so far this is a one-way street.  The establishment sees it differently.  In a recent speech, India's central bank Governor Shaktikanta Das forecasted that the next financial crisis would start with crypto and thus, it should be banned.  ""Our view is that it should be prohibited because if you try to regulate it and allow it to grow, please mark my words, the next financial crisis will come from private cryptocurrencies,"" CoinDesk reported Das as saying. ""They have no underlying value. They have huge inherent risks for our macro economic and financial stability. I [have] yet to hear any credible argument about what public good or what public purpose it serves.""  Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), the U.S. Senate Banking Committee chairman, made a similar argument during a recent appearance on the television news program ""Meet the Press"" but was able to (correctly) say that this would be difficult as it would simply force crypto to move entirely offshore.  The financial crisis both are referring to is a loss of state control of money. This was also a theme in the white paper for China’s central bank digital currency (CBDC).  While India has liberalized capital controls in recent years, they still exist. It maintains strict control over the nation’s money supply under the auspices of fighting inflation – which could be lethal for an emerging market with a large percentage of low earners.  The U.S. doesn’t like crypto because it's a headache for its hegemonic ambitions. In a world that largely trades in dollars, U.S. control over the money supply means it can prosecute crimes when there is only a marginal connection to the country (see: Huawei, and BitMex).  For lawmakers in both countries, it would be easier if crypto just ""went away."" Even after a year where there was a trifecta of calamity — Terra, Three Arrows Capital and FTX — bitcoin is still at $16,800, and the broader crypto market cap is just north of $800 billion.  Crypto has weathered the storm that macroeconomic events and black swans brought upon it. Although it continues to be in the crosshairs of regulators, its problems have yet to cross the chasm into traditional finance (TradFi). If they really want to ban crypto, they are going to need to try a bit harder.

The application is owned by Binance and the token is very much under Binance's control. One of the top performing assets in the cryptocurrency market over the last two months has been Trust Wallet Token ( TWT-USD ). Trust Wallet is a self-custodial crypto application that allows users to hold cryptocurrencies off of exchanges. Since the collapse of FTX ( FTT-USD ) in early November, very few crypto tokens are actually up. Trust Wallet Token is one that is still 40% higher than where it was in early November while Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and Binance Smart Chain ( BNB-USD ) are both down over the same timeframe. 6 month performance (Seeking Alpha) What has helped propel TWT higher is that self-custody of crypto is becoming fashionable and the token has benefitted from a narrative trade tailwind following the FTX disaster. However, despite being a self-custodial wallet, Binance actually owns Trust Wallet after purchasing it in 2018. Narrative Trade Like Celsius ( CEL-USD ) and Voyager (VYGVQ) before it, FTX is yet another failing of a centralized cryptocurrency exchange. Despite decentralization and self-custody being some of the core principles of Bitcoin advocates, most of the trading that happens within the crypto industry is through centralized companies rather than through decentralized protocols or exchanges known as DEXes. This reliance on third party custodians rather than self-storage of funds has clearly created problems with trust in the crypto industry. This diminishing trust in centralized custody has led to a substantial move higher in some of the self-custodial wallet tokens including TWT. Wallet Usage According to BscScan, there are over 300K TWT token holders. The Trust Wallet website claims more than 25 million people are using the wallet. However when we dig into some of the platform usage metrics, we can see that daily active usage might be a bit underwhelming considering the quoted number of wallet users: Trust Wallet Usage via 1inch DAU Trades Daily Volume Binance Chain 4,935 6,794 $3.7m Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) 806 1,157 $8.0m Polygon ( MATIC-USD ) 2,576 3,620 $0.9m Source: Dune Analytics/revoak, 7 Day averages 1inch ( 1INCH-USD ) is the leading DEX aggregator used in DeFi. Depending on the day, 1inch touches anywhere from 60-80% of the DEX traffic on Ethereum. It isn't the only DEX aggregator and these figures aren't absolute. But these metrics are a good picture into how the Trust Wallet application performs from a daily usage standpoint. In a typical day, there are a little over 8 thousand daily active users accounting for about $12.6 million in trading volume combined among Polygon, Ethereum, and Binance Smart Chain. BSC Trust Wallet Swaps (Dune Analytics/revoak) Despite the low number of users and trades, the general trend in swaps for Trust Wallet is positive on Binance Smart Chain. ETH Trust Wallet Swaps (Dune Analytics/revoak) On Ethereum, the trend is a little more flat and we're seeing the same on Polygon as well. Tokenomics TWT has been a phenomenal trade over the last several weeks but that doesn't necessarily mean the token itself has good tokenomics. What gives any application-based token a fundamental purpose is either governance or some sort of utility within the application. This is indeed the case for Trust Wallet Token. Users of the Trust Wallet can expect reduction on fees and DEX services within the platform when they hold TWT. Holding the token also offers governance over the protocol but I don't think that's a valid utility unless voters are active and the ownership of the token is as decentralized as possible. From a circulating supply perspective, TWT has a very odd back story. According to the wallet site , 89 billion TWT tokens were burned due to very slow emissions: As TWT continues to become a more established token, we took some time to study the market and evaluate the current tokenomics of TWT. The total supply began as 90 billion TWT, and despite continuous token distribution, less than 1% of the total supply was circulating. Therefore, we made the decision to burn 89 billion TWT to reduce the total supply to 1 billion TWT. Given the massive reduction in max supply, I'd expect the circulating supply to be larger than it currently is; Max supply: 1 billion Circulating supply: 416.6 million With just under 42% of the max supply in circulation, there is a substantial amount of dilution remaining in the token. A glance at the token holder distribution shows 78% of the total supply is held by one wallet. TWT Token Holders ( BscScan ) This wallet is the BSC Token Hub wallet and it means that TWT goes as Binance says it goes. Binance was able to prick the FTX bubble because of a position that it held in FTX Token. Even though Binance actually owns Trust Wallet and doesn't figure to have anything to gain from dumping TWT, I think this level of token centralization from an application that is designed for the opposite is a problem. Risks There has been a lot of FUD lately about Binance and BinanceUS. While I like the idea of a self-custodial token that has in-app utility, I personally can't reconcile that Trust Wallet Tokens, and Trust Wallet for that matter, are really under the control of one central body. It goes against the entire point of self-ownership to have a self-custodial wallet application owned by the biggest exchange in the world. Summary Binance as an entity and an ecosystem has a substantial amount risk at the moment and I personally can't get behind the idea of having too much exposure to this entity from an investment perspective. To be clear, that goes both for the exchange itself, and the applications that are built in the company's public blockchain ecosystem. I'm a large supporter of self-custody and decentralized applications. My personal wallets of choice are Unstoppable and ShapeShift and I've covered a decentralized wallet token for BlockChain Reaction subscribers previously. When it comes to managing assets through a wallet application, I have never personally used Trust Wallet but it does have strong reviews and a 4.7 average on 191K iOS ratings. But strong reviews and a great application don't necessarily mean you need to hold the token. For a platform that boasts 25 million users and a token that is supposed to provide in-app utility for those users, just a few thousand daily active users and 78% of the tokens being held on exchanges doesn't exactly give much confidence that the app users feel the token is necessary. If you're a sophisticated trader, the TWT rally is one that you can probably fade.",NEGATIVE,ETH | BNB | TWT,ETH | EXCHANGE | ICO | BNB | TWT,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4565839-trust-wallet-token-fading-narrative-trade?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/6122376.jpeg
