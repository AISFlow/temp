42416122,c03DFnfLU3SbZvH4PuZOKd,1665004185,Market Wrap: Crypto Markets Flatten as Latest Employment Data Throws a Setback for Inflation Hawks,"Price Action  Bitcoin and ether prices flattened in Wednesday trading as investors weighed the latest jobs data suggesting the economy isn’t finished growing.  Bitcoin’s (BTC) price slumped a fraction of a percentage point on Wednesday but climbed back above the $20,000 level after slumping below earlier in the day. BTC had declined overnight and accelerated for several hours, with the sharpest decline occurring during the 13:00 UTC hour (9:00 a.m. ET), as U.S. traditional markets opened and ADP’s Employment report on job creation in the private sector arrived hotter than expected. BTC volume during the downturn exceeded its average volume during that time frame by 5 times.  Ether’s (ETH) price’s also declined, as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization fell 0.95%, erasing a portion of its gains from the prior two days. ETH’s biggest drop occurred during the 13:00 UTC (9:00 a.m. ET) timeframe. ETH prices are down 19% since the Merge, the Ethereum network’s conversion from a proof-of-work consensus mechanism to a proof-of-stake system on Sept. 15.  The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based market index that measures the performance of a basket of cryptocurrencies, recently declined by 0.32%.  Macro View  U.S. Equities: Traditional stocks declined following strong labor data, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), tech-heavy Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 fell 0.14%, 0.25% and 0.20%, respectively.  Commodities:  OPEC (the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries) announced a 2 million barrel per day cut in oil production.  In the U.S., crude oil inventories dropped by 1.36 million barrels versus expectations for a 2.1 million barrel increase for the week ending Sept 30. Gasoline inventories fell by 4.7 million barrels, significantly more than the expected 1.3 million barrel decrease, and the largest decline in eight weeks.  Both developments will likely send energy prices higher, a challenging scenario given the U.S. central bank’s current priority to tame inflation.  Energy markets rose following the OPEC announcement and U.S. inventory data, as WTI and Brent European crude increased 1.8% and 2%, respectively. Natural gas prices increased 1.8%.  Metals: Gold prices declined 0.3%, while copper futures rose 1.6%  Economic Calendar  ADP Employment, which measures job creation among private U.S. businesses, grew by 208,000 in September, versus consensus estimates of 200,000, and a 12% increase over the 185,000 jobs created in August.  According to the report, annual pay increased 7.8% for workers who stayed at their jobs, while wages for job changers increased 15.7%.  The news, which showed a still-hot jobs market, indicated that the economy is not slowing as much as inflation hawks had hoped to see.

Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Technical Take  BTC continues to trade in a consolidated range  BTC prices spent much of Wednesday toggling above and below $20,000, as the largest cryptocurrency by market cap continues to trade in a tight range.  The Average True Range (ATR) for BTC has decreased 64% in 2022. ATR measures an asset’s daily range of movement. The contraction of ATR for bitcoin signals prices have gotten less volatile.  In lieu of a tangible catalyst, BTC continues to fluctuate as the narrative around economic growth changes. Tuesday’s Market Wrap highlighted increased optimism for a Federal Reserve pivot to lower interest rates, which seemingly pushed risk assets (both traditional and digital) higher.  Today’s better-than-expected ADP jobs data is having the opposite effect, giving the Fed additional cover to follow through on its intentions to push interest rates aggressively higher. The CME FedWatch tool continues to project another hefty 0.75-percentage-point (75-basis-point) rate hike in November.  For BTC investors looking for bullish signs, on-chain analytics offer potential clues for bitcoin price expansion when volatility begins to increase.  The net position change for stablecoins (denoted in green in the chart below) on cryptocurrency exchanges has begun to increase again, and has been net positive in each of the most recent 24 days.  Often an increase in the balance of stablecoins implies additional buying pressure for an asset, whereas the increased supply of cryptocurrencies (i.e. BTC and ETH), implies increased selling pressure.  For BTC investors leaning bearishly, the current bitcoin price appears to be near its production cost.  Glassnode’s Difficulty Regression Model estimates the “cost of production” for BTC miners, and currently it puts that at approximately $18,081, or 11% below bitcoin’s current price. A reduction in BTC’s price below this figure is likely to add stress to bitcoin miners, which could have a downward impact on prices as well.  Viewing that in conjunction with technical data, however, implies that while nearing the cost of production, buying support exists at levels above $18,000.  Volume Profile Visual Range (VPVR), a tool that illustrates trading volume by price level, indicates that historically BTC investors have been willing to add to long positions in a range between $19,000 and $20,000.

42393771,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpAnTj,1665000064,US CFTC as Crypto’s Regulatory Savior? Crypto Firms Might Not Like What They Get,"Just because Rostin Behnam is the rare government official who can casually drop a comment that suggests a future explosion in bitcoin’s price doesn’t mean he’s a crypto bro.  The chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is widely seen in crypto circles as a relatively friendly face in government, and Behnam often says things that seem to reinforce that view.  Speaking to students at New York University last week, Behnam said he was “cautious to be a cheerleader” for crypto, but described the industry’s explosive growth as “exciting” and “fascinating.”  “I think there’s a few folks who wish this technology might go away, think it might go away, think it might go offshore, but I think there’s a number of reasons from a U.S. perspective that it’s important we engage [with the industry],” Behnam said.  “We need to ask the hard questions about whether or not this is the future of finance and the future of our economy which it very well may be.”  Behnam also predicted that cryptocurrency businesses finally submitting to government rules and supervision will make investors more money, suggesting that the price of bitcoin could even double. Getting a bitcoin price prediction – even a hypothetical one – from a sitting regulator left Jeremy Liabo, a Chicago-based attorney at law firm Ropes & Gray, “surprised.”  But Behnam is a federal regulator installed by the same president that picked Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chief Gary Gensler, who is held up by the crypto industry as its governmental antagonist. Gensler’s SEC is often accused of regulating crypto through enforcement actions, and it’s showing signs that it only intends to speed up that process. While Behnam had been seen as the gentler hand who was less openly scornful of the digital-assets movement, his agency has been waging an enforcement battle that belies that reputation.  “If somebody thinks you're going to get a pass at the CFTC, I think that's a mistaken belief,” said Gary DeWaal, a former CFTC enforcement lawyer now at Katten Muchin Rosenman. “Any violation is going to be met with enforcement actions by either regulator, and they're going to be severe.”  Pushback  The CFTC itself has also pushed back against the misconception that it will regulate the industry with a lighter touch than the SEC.  “We’ve been very strong in enforcement in the digital asset space,” CFTC Commissioner Caroline Pham told attendees at Korea Blockchain Week in August. “Anybody who thinks that the CFTC is not going to be tough might have missed when we fined all the banks billions of dollars for fraud and manipulation after the financial crisis.”  Mike Selig, a New York-based attorney at law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher, said that crypto firms should not equate enforcement actions with “unfriendly” regulation.  “New laws and rules will be needed to accomodate [decentralized finance],” Selig said. “But I think there is a willingness both at the commissioner level and staff level to work with the crypto industry to bring responsible innovation to the U.S.”  Read more: Bitcoin Could Double in Price Under CFTC Regulation, Chairman Behnam Says  The momentum in Congress is on track to elevate the CFTC as the key front-line regulator for cryptocurrency trading. Every serious legislative effort favors that path, such as the bill in Senate and House agriculture committees that would make the agency the regulator of the so-called spot market for tokens that aren’t securities. In Behnam’s view, that means trading of bitcoins and ethereum which represent the vast majority of crypto’s market cap.  The Senate Agriculture Committee bill – pushed by Behnam’s former boss, panel Chairwoman Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) – would give the CFTC an unprecedented ability to charge the crypto industry fees to fund the new oversight. The CFTC, with fewer than 700 employees, is tucked into a humble building in northwest Washington, D.C. It’s always been much smaller than the SEC, which employs more than 4,500, but these new fees could allow it to build up considerably.  Some of the industry’s preference for the CFTC may be a vestige of its previous management, including figures such as previous Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo (also now at Willkie), who favored a “do no harm” approach to digital assets and went on to write a crypto book, advise companies in the industry and earn a French knighthood in part because of his crypto work.  Would crypto firms still favor the agency if it grew longer arms and bigger teeth?  Liabo said he believes there’s a misconception in the crypto industry about what it means to be a friendly regulator.  “The CFTC is a friendly regulator in that it is open to innovation,” Liabo explained. “Friendly does not, however, mean that the CFTC does not enforce the laws.”  Wave of enforcement  In his public remarks, Behnam often comes across as knowledgeable about crypto and enthusiastic about its potential.  At New York University last week, Behnam used privacy browser Brave and decentralized storage protocol Filecoin as examples of crypto’s potential.  “I used to rave about Filecoin … it’s empowering us as individuals,” Behnam said. “I think there’s a bit of frustration that we all see about the way the internet functions right now. And if the new internet can empower us as individuals and allow us to monetize what we do and how we do it, you’d be hard-pressed to find someone who wouldn’t be at least willing to engage and indulge in that activity and make an extra buck.”  However, a telling sign has emerged that reveals some of the CFTC’s inner thinking. In its latest enforcement action, the agency targeted the Ooki DAO with accusations it offered illegal trading without the proper government approvals or regulatory controls. That potentially sets a controversial precedent in holding participants in a decentralized autonomous organization accountable for their organization’s missteps.  ""The CFTC is pushing its legal authority,"" said Jaret Seiberg, an analyst with Cowen, citing the Ooki DAO action. ""It confirms our view that the agency would be a tough regulator if Congress makes it the lead on crypto.""  Behnam said it himself at a meeting of top U.S. regulators this week, when the Financial Stability Oversight Council issued a report saying the spotty government powers over crypto could threaten the wider financial system.  “I think we are going to collectively – the SEC and CFTC – work together to ensure we use all of the existing enforcement authority we have until new authority is provided,” Behnam said.  DeWaal contends the CFTC had already been showing it’s willing to be aggressive in enforcement, such as in cases against Tether, Bitfinex and Coinbase Inc.  “If you stack up the big names in the crypto industry, there have been more big names captured by the CFTC in their lawsuits than the SEC,” DeWaal said.  “I do worry about the political jockeying for power ahead of the decision by Congress – the desire to one-up each other to show who is the tougher regulator,” said Paul McCaffery, the head of alternative capital sales at investment bank Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. “It disappoints me that the CFTC opted for the SEC rule-by-enforcement playbook. Hopefully we see a legitimate process going forward and less splashy grandstanding, which is what I think this Kim Kardashian settlement was with Gensler this week.”  SEC here to stay  Still, even if the CFTC becomes a primary regulator, the industry is never going to get rid of the SEC. Whenever anything in crypto looks like an investment contract, the agency will be there to regulate it. And key legislation still allows the securities regulator to make important calls on defining which tokens it thinks are securities, which Gensler routinely says will include most cryptocurrencies.  Behnam has publicly agreed with Gensler.  “I have no doubt that the vast majority of the tokens that exist in the digital asset ecosystem are security tokens,” Behnam said at NYU last week, stressing the need for both regulators to working together to best regulate the crypto industry.  “Both agencies will have a role going forward,” DeWaal said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,"Jesse Hamilton, Cheyenne Ligon",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/10/05/us-cftc-as-cryptos-regulatory-savior-crypto-firms-might-not-like-what-they-get,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9661fc5741a5a6310f3e8f3b251c12a55061b7fc-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42416100,c03DFnfLU3SbZvH4PuZMn1,1664999862,"Crucial US Jobs Report Could Test Fed's Resolve, Bitcoin's Resilience","Another week, another shift in tone: Traders in traditional markets are once again betting that the U.S. Federal Reserve could soon pivot to a softer stance on monetary policy.  But a strong U.S. jobs report on Friday from the Labor Department could give policymakers a reason to not back off. Bitcoin (BTC), which often trades like a risky asset, similar to stocks, might remain under pressure If that were the case.  Futures traders on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange now expect the federal funds rate to peak at 4.5% next year; just a week ago the expectation was for the rate to go as high as 4.7%.  The change suggests that more traders are suddenly anticipating a more dovish approach by the Fed, which recently raised interest rates to the highest level since 2007 and continues to reiterate that it won’t cut rates next year. With inflation still elevated, the campaign is far from over, officials insist.  Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President Mary Daly said on Tuesday that there is “a lot” of room for policy makers to raise rates and that she is not worried about markets right now.  A key question is whether the Fed’s aggressive rate hikes could start to freeze lending and markets or pose risks to the stability of the traditional financial system.  “We always have the lender-of-last-resort responsibilities, and if market dislocation should come about, then we would be prepared to use that, but that's not what I'm seeing right now,"" she said.  This week’s Job Openings and Labor Turnover report, known as JOLTS, showed that the labor market is cooling – a positive sign that the Fed’s changes in monetary policy are starting to have an effect. However, the ADP National Employment report – capturing private payrolls – showed an uptick in hiring in September.  Employment situation  The numbers reported still suggest signs of a very tight labor market.  As Harvard Professor Jason Furman summarized in a tweet, “The labor market went from very, very tight to very tight.”  Friday’s Employment Situation report, scheduled for release at 8:30 a.m. ET by the Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics, will likely show a similar weakening in the job market, surveys show. According to FactSet, economists expect an increase of 250,000 jobs in September, in a slowdown from the 315,000 reported for the month prior.  “The employment number is the most important economic indicator,” said John Silvia, a former chief economist for Wells Fargo who founded Dynamic Economic Strategy.  Economic growth  The signals are mixed, though.  The Atlanta Federal Reserve's GDPNow forecasting model this week shows that gross domestic product probably increased by 2.7% in the third quarter, versus a prediction of 2.3% just a couple of days ago. This suggests that the economy is in good shape to sustain further pain caused by the Fed.  “The upswing in the Atlanta Fed GDPNow forecast suggests the economy is OK and that the Fed could still be aggressive,” Silvia said. This is in addition to “broader inflation numbers still suggesting that the Fed needs to tighten.”  As long as traders don't see a robust report on Friday combined with a strong rise in wages, bitcoin should continue to be stable, according to market analysts.  “Traders would not be surprised if we saw a downside miss,” said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda. “There has been a steady flow of hiring freeze announcements or layoffs across corporate America and the U.S. growth outlook was deteriorating in September, which should be reflected across several interest rate-hike sensitive sectors.”  “Bitcoin should maintain a healthy bid but still be confined to its respective trading range around the $20,000 level,” Moya said.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/10/05/crucial-us-jobs-report-could-test-feds-resolve-bitcoins-resilience,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/66170777f8da81e3c2b55dcd2228bee0cd15a65f-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

XRP gains another key victory in its ongoing legal battle with SEC Altcoin is up by 8.5% for the past seven days XRP on its way to the $0.52 resistance level On September 29, a ruling for the release of emails and other correspondence authored by William Hinman, former SEC Corporation Finance Division Director, was ordered by a U.S. District Court Judge. Documents being sought after by the court pertain to a Hinman speech where he stated Ethereum is not a security because it was sufficiently decentralized just like Bitcoin. Ripple, with this development, has put itself in an advantageous position to win the long-running court battle with SEC.

42416108,c03DFnfLU3SbZvH4PuZNWJ,1664996915,Celsius' Crypto Customers Face Big Obstacle in Trying to Claw Back Their Deposits,"The bankruptcy case of cryptocurrency lender Celsius Network is entering a new phase where shareholders will be pitted against the firm's beleaguered customers, with customers seemingly facing a major disadvantage as the company parcels out its assets in an auction.  A recent motion to appoint a preferred equity committee seeks to put shareholders at the front of the queue when it comes to the sale of the custody firm GK8 that Celsius owns and Celsius' mining operations. (Celsius' assets are due to be auctioned off later this month.) A point of interest will likely be changes made to Celsius’ corporate structure in the midst of last year’s Series B funding round that raised $750 million just months before the company collapsed.  That transaction put customers behind equity holders in terms of getting repaid if Celsius went bankrupt and its valuable crypto-mining assets got sold, said Vincent Indelicato, a partner at law firm Proskauer Rose. And that’s something the independent examiner who was appointed to sort out why Celsius fell apart will want to look at, he added.  “The equity [holders] have a direct claim against any value derived from a sale or monetization of the mining assets, to the exclusion of all the customer claims,” Indelicato said in an interview with CoinDesk. “And I certainly think that the examiner and other parties, such as the committee, will highly scrutinize that transaction to determine, among other things, how and why Celsius moved the customer accounts in the manner it did.”  The fate of customers and their deposits is one of the biggest unanswered questions in the Celsius case. And amateurs being last in line to get repaid, behind pros backed by an army of lawyers and bankers, is not exactly an unfamiliar story in bankruptcies.  Since Celsius filed for bankruptcy in July, the temperature in the case has kept rising. The latest bombshell was the sudden resignation of CEO Alex Mashinsky, who was later reported to have withdrawn $10 million from the firm a month before its accounts were frozen in June.  Raising money and reshuffling  Celsius' Series B fundraising began in early 2021 and was completed at the end of November. The consumer business was moved under a U.S. entity, as indicated in a change to the firm’s terms of service that users had to agree to last year. Meanwhile, Celsius’ mining operations were placed under the Celsius U.K. entity, as was GK8, the custody tech firm Celsius purchased for $115 million last November.  Whether the Celsius mid-fundraising ownership reshuffle might be linked to a fraudulent transfer, a pre-bankruptcy transaction that essentially defrauds creditors, is one of the areas the external examiner will look into.  “Somewhere in the middle of the Series B due diligence, Celsius finds out that the consumer business has regulatory problems, or maybe it’s insolvent – who knows what they find?” said Thomas Braziel, founder of bankruptcy investment specialist 507 Capital. “So they have to move things around: Investors will give the firm money at a high valuation, but they have to be first in line for the mining operations and custody firm GK8.”  At the very least, the committee of unsecured creditors will play a large role in reviewing the preferred equity investments and identify whether proceeds of customer assets were also used to fund the mining operations, said Gregory Plotko, a partner with Crowell & Moring’s bankruptcy and creditors rights practice in New York.  “The characterization of that customer funding (as either an intercompany loan or equity investment) will be a major factor in determining the relative rights of each group to the allocation of value,” Plotko said via email.  All in one pool  An extreme measure would be to invoke so-called “substantive consolidation,” a term familiar to bankruptcy insiders, when a court allows the consolidation of all of the debtors’ assets into one large pool, rather than under separate entities.  A bankruptcy judge in New York won't grant substantive consolidation unless it becomes clear that it’s impossible to unravel the individual transaction. (The bankruptcy of Augie/Restivo Baking Co.is a case where consolidation was granted and later appealed against. Substantive consolidation was later invoked in the 2003 WorldCom scandal.)  “Sometimes, like with fraudulent transfer in bankruptcy court, just the threat and the inherent uncertainty and attendant expense and delay of litigation is enough to induce the parties to settle,” said Proskauer’s Indelicato. “So a lot of these claims and theories in practice never get adjudicated to finality. Instead they get used as quivers in the arsenal to try to apply pressure.”  Another wrinkle in this case, and one that hasn't really been written about much, is the suggestion of a potential conflict of interest regarding White & Case, the law firm representing Celsius' creditors.  Lawyers from White & Case also advised equity firm WestCap on its part in leading the Celsius Series B round. This potentially leads to an awkward situation where White & Case could end up having to investigate due diligence its own firm performed during the fundraising.  White & Case declined to comment. Celsius didn't respond to requests for comment by press time.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MINING | REGULATION,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/10/05/celsius-crypto-customers-face-big-obstacle-in-trying-to-claw-back-their-deposits,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/98241487ff32c9b2b6659b0fbda48dab86e04ab6-1593x1195.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42416118,c03DFnfLU3SbZvH4PuZO5X,1664990993,Crypto Derivatives Exchange PowerTrade Launches 'RFQs' for Institutional Options Trading,"PowerTrade, a crypto exchange focused on derivatives, is rolling out a request-for-quote (RFQ) model for the options market, which it says will cater to institutional investors by mirroring a widely used practice in traditional finance.  The exchange, which is available as a mobile and web-based application, is the latest to launch an RFQ model. Institutional players tend to prefer to trade options as multi-leg RFQs as they allow investors to buy and sell assets in bulk. Generally speaking, an RFQ is when an investor asks brokers or market makers to bid on a trade.  Other exchanges such as Paradigm and Dfyn have launched RFQs in the past. Deribit, the world’s largest bitcoin and ether options exchange, offers a similar option called “COMBOS”.  The RFQ workflow goes as follows:  Client A sends an RFQ, which is then visible to all market makers, including any other client who wants to show a quote.  PowerTrade’s options market maker sends a two-way quote (bid/offer) back to client A.  Client A or any other client who is logged into the exchange can trade on the quote, and the trade settles on the platform.  Proponents say that RFQs allow users to gain access to better prices, particularly for medium- and high-volume trades.  “Our goal with RFQ is to drive the adoption of the crypto options markets by supporting smaller institutional traders with no minimum order sizes,” said Bernd Sischka, head of institutional sales at PowerTrade, in an interview with CoinDesk. “We are tackling key problems in the crypto derivatives industry that are impeding rapid adoption of these products amongst the traditional finance clients.”  PowerTrade says its investors include Pantera Capital, Ledger Prime and QCP Capital.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/10/05/crypto-derivatives-exchange-powertrade-launches-rfqs-for-institutional-options-trading,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/94994b5a4dadc41195af3054fcdd1a725a245392-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42416115,c03DFnfLU3SbZvH4PuZNqR,1664989314,"Interest Surges in Bitcoin Speculation, But It Might Be Bearish","A new record has been reached in the trading of a key speculative tool in cryptocurrency markets: the bitcoin perpetual swap.  Open interest in the “perps,” as they are known, has spiked to an all-time high of 450,000 BTC, according to data from Arcane Research. Perpetual swaps are an innovation in crypto markets that offer leverage to speculative traders – similar to futures contracts in traditional markets, but without expiration dates.  One caveat for bitcoin bulls is that, at least in the current market, the data point might be more worrisome than something to cheer about.  The open interest, or OI – the total outstanding amount of the trading contracts – has been on a vertical climb since the Terra blockchain’s collapse in May. Arcane Research wrote in a report that open interest in BTC perps is always evenly distributed between longs and shorts.  Bitcoin funding rates  Arcane’s report included a chart showing that bitcoin perpetual “funding rates” – what traders pay for leverage on the contracts – were negative for most of September, indicating that demand from speculative bearish traders outweighed demand from the bulls. But recently, the chart shows, the funding rate has flipped into positive territory. Arcane cited funding rates on the crypto exchanges Binance and Bybit.  “The latest push topped with neutral funding rates on Binance suggests that short-term optimism by bulls has contributed to the recent spike,” the Arcane analysts wrote. “Be aware of any breakouts of BTC’s trading range. This clogged-up open interest is likely to exaggerate any directional move as it gets unclogged.”  The BTC-denominated open interest in perpetuals since Oct. 1 across all platforms increased by the equivalent of more than 60,000 BTC, according to the report.  “This shows more positioning/engagement from investors,” said Florian Giovannacci, head of trading for Covario, a prime brokerage for digital assets. Giovannacci noted that this isn’t a sign of bullish or bearish positioning, though, and that bitcoin basis levels are a better indicator for that.  The bitcoin basis level is the difference between the future contract and the spot price.  Bitcoin’s annualized basis for December expiry is sitting at around 0.3%, according to data from crypto options exchange Deribit.  “Bitcoin basis levels still remain fairly flat, making it difficult to draw directional conclusions if the basis does not move,” he said.  “The option market is more revealing, with a more bullish positioning seen in higher demand for upside strikes and a skew (difference of implied volatility between downside puts and upside calls) under pressure,” Giovannacci said.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/10/05/interest-surges-in-bitcoin-speculation-but-it-might-be-bearish,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/27689c25a1c0f641b23a4f4eb98526ef27c5c5e4-2211x850.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411330,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNDpa,1664988236,"Elon Musk, Twitter and the Social-Media Double Bind","Elon Musk is buying Twitter (TWTR).  No, he means it this time, really. Probably.  In some corners of the internet, Elon Musk and Twitter’s recommitment ceremony is being celebrated for a worrying reason: not because Musk will make Twitter a better company for users, but because he will (some believe) use his new $44 billion toy as a weapon against his political enemies.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Let’s leave aside for a moment whether owning the libs is a good thing or not. The real issue is that one man could conceivably control such an important site of public discourse. Elon Musk may soon have the individual power to decide who can and can’t use Twitter, which would give him substantial influence over public perception, not just in the U.S., but around the world. That’s potentially disastrous both for the public and for Twitter as a company (the latter being one reason it might not happen).  See also: Elon Musk Shouldn't Lead Twitter | Opinion  The ultimate takeaway is that a service like Twitter shouldn't have a single point of failure, including a takeover by a slightly unhinged billionaire. Many experts at least in theory support a shift from centrally controlled “platforms” like Twitter and toward open “protocols” that allow for mobility and interaction across platforms, the same way email and RSS feeds do for other digital communication today.  But first, you might be thinking: Didn’t Elon Musk already buy Twitter?  It is indeed confusing. Musk first said he was going to buy Twitter back in April, because he was mad about certain people being blocked or banned from the publicly traded social-media site. But then he tried to back out, maybe because the stock market slumped, but also maybe because the whole thing was actually cover for dumping close to $15 billion in Tesla (TSLA) stock and he has bad lawyers. Hard to say, really.  Musk sued Twitter with some tissue-thin pretexts about bots to end the deal and was set to go to trial this month, but he may have finally realized just how terrible his lawyers (or his own legal instincts) are. He has now told Twitter that he will proceed with the sale at the original $44 billion price, news that sent Twitter's stock up nearly 25% on Tuesday.  Ironically, we have reason to trust Musk’s seriousness here because he didn’t announce this on Twitter, but instead sent a letter to Twitter that Twitter then filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  The 'editorial' issue  So, back to protocols and platforms. The fundamental problem facing Twitter and other social-media sites is that they have, bit by bit, been forced to become editorial decision-makers, including on major topics such as whether to let Donald Trump tweet. Elon Musk, alongside a broader pivot toward the political right, has said he would allow the former president back on the platform.  More generally, Musk has decried “censorship” by Twitter, likely including the platform’s crackdown on skepticism of vaccines and other COVID-19 measures, which Musk has occasionally seemed to share.  There are reasons to think Musk doesn’t have a nuanced understanding of content moderation, and to an extent, that’s fair enough: He appears to simply want as little moderation as possible. But that’s not workable as long as Twitter is a company, for two reasons. First, like it or not, Twitter has the ability to control what content is seen through the service, and that implies both legal and ethical responsibility to at the very least block content that exploits children or foments violence. Ultimately, a human has to decide where even that line lies.  Second, whether it’s public or private, Twitter is a for-profit enterprise, and it has decided that blocking certain people, behaviors and content is good for its overall business. Legalities aside, for instance, it seems that kicking Donald Trump off Twitter has made the service more enjoyable for a large segment of users. And crucially, Musk will probably need Twitter’s revenue to pay off his big purchase, and so once he’s actually pot committed, his desire to shake things up might fade away.  Free speech  These dynamics create a serious double bind for Twitter and other companies that promise unrestricted freedom of speech. The issue was a serious pain point for Twitter founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey, who had to watch, and at times oversaw, the company’s descent from the ""the free speech wing of the free speech party” to what it is today. Ahead of Musk’s takeover announcement, Dorsey lobbied Musk to remake Twitter in a radically new form.  “Twitter started as a protocol,” Dorsey texted Musk back in March. “It should have never been a company. That was the original sin.”  A broadly accepted social-media protocol would, above all, solve the content moderation dilemma by separating content hosting from moderation. Different clients would be able to apply different filtering or ranking algorithms to the same stream of posts, in the same way different email services filter spam differently. They would be able to test different business models informed by those different algorithms. That would leave Twitter and other content hosts free to do only the most minimal content moderation without shouldering responsibility for controversial edge cases.  See also: Elon Musk Wants to Authenticate Every Twitter User. Crypto Should Take Notice | Opinion  But is there any realistic path to getting there? Back in 2019, Dorsey announced that Twitter would launch a “small team” to create an “open and decentralized standard for social media,” called Blue Sky. Twitter has the heft and scale to introduce a credible protocol, but there hasn’t been much news on that front since. The more conventional route of companies collaborating on a standard through the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has been largely dormant for years.  Put simply, companies have concluded that building walled gardens is the best way to profit from social media.  There may be a credible path to using blockchain to create an open social standard, but in practical terms, the Web3 community hasn’t had much better luck than Twitter or W3C. The most high-profile attempts to create a blockchain-based open social layer have been ill-conceived and possibly little more than hasty buzzword-driven cash grabs. More credible projects such as the Lens Protocol do exist, but scaling them up will be a long and uncertain process.  In the meantime, it looks like many of us will be living in Elon Musk’s world for a while, even more than we were before.

The Justice Department has published two reports in response to President Joe Biden's March executive order on crypto, including one on information sharing on crypto crimes internationally and one announcing the formation of a group of prosecutors who would specialize in crypto crimes.

42416104,c03DFnfLU3SbZvH4PuZN79,1664986818,Second Crypto Group Objects to CFTC's Use of Chatbot to Serve Legal Papers,"The DeFi Education Fund (DEF), a Washington, D.C.-based lobbying group focused on decentralized finance (DeFi) issues, has joined a group of crypto lawyers in arguing that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) should not be allowed to serve the defendants of a lawsuit merely by posting on a website.  The DEF filed to join the case as a friend of the court on Monday, arguing that the way the CFTC is approaching the question of service ""could chill novel and innovative forms of software development."" The filing comes just after the LeXpunK Army, a group of lawyers and developers in crypto, filed a similar motion to join the case.  The CFTC asked Judge William Orrick of the District Court for the Northern District of California to rule that a forum post and a website help chatbot submission were sufficient to properly serve notice to Ooki DAO and its members that they were the named defendants in an ongoing enforcement action. The judge ruled in the CFTC's favor on Monday, the same day LeXpunK filed its motion to join the case.  At issue is the definition of just who is a member in a DAO.  The CFTC sued Ooki DAO last month on allegations that it was offering margined and leveraged trading products without registering as a futures commission merchant or having a know-your-customer process. The regulator also settled with the DAO's predecessor, bZeroX, and the company's founders, Kyle Kistner and Tom Bean. BZeroX, Bean and Kistner were accused of the same conduct that Ooki DAO allegedly engages in, though the CFTC settled Bean and Kistner's DAO-related charges alongside the bZeroX charges.  Read more: CFTC’s Ooki DAO Action Shatters Illusion of Regulator-Proof Protocol  The DEF argued in its filing that DAOs are not the same as centralized businesses and should not be treated the same.  ""In many cases, DAOs lack any central organization or management, and many DAO token holders often lack coordination or common objectives. As a result, DAOs will often not be 'associations' of any kind, and therefore will not be proper defendants in an enforcement action brought under the Commodity Exchange Act ('CEA'), which requires that a defendant be a 'person' (defined to include 'associations'),"" the DEF's filing said.  The CFTC should have to prove that Ooki DAO is ""an association"" before it can serve it.  Beyond that, the CFTC's current effort to serve the DAO is inadequate, the DEF argued.  In a statement shared with CoinDesk, a spokesperson said, ""If the CFTC is allowed to proceed in, what we view as, a misguided method of service that deprives the Ooki DAO token holders their right to due process, then it would not just result in a serious misjustice, but also will chill novel innovation and innovative forms of governance and software development in the United States.""",NEGATIVE,없음,COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/10/05/second-crypto-group-objects-to-cftcs-use-of-chat-bot-to-serve-legal-papers,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e63b656b39441cd498b813a5810b02ae885bad2c-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Shiba Inu dog-meme-inspired crypto was trading at around $0.063 at the time of writing, a decline of 4.5% compared to the $0.066 it rallied to at approximately 00:30 UTC Wednesday.  Having treaded water in the range of $0.059-$0.061 for the past few days, DOGE saw a spike Tuesday following the news that Musk had proposed moving forward again with his bid to buy Twitter.  Traders see Musk's proposed plans to buy Twitter as bullish for DOGE and crypto more broadly, given the possibility of cryptocurrency payments being integrated into the platform and Musk's well-known interest in the meme-based crypto.  However, this relationship may be decoupling should DOGE's rally continue to taper off.  The Tesla CEO first offered to buy Twitter in April for around $44 billion in cash, which was accepted by the social media company's board. However, Musk scrapped his bid in July over claims that Twitter had made false and misleading representations over the number of spam or fake accounts on the platform.  Following news that the purchase may be back on, Twitter shares surged 13% and were halted Tuesday morning at $47.96, before briefly resuming trading at the end of day to close at $52.05.

Hamilton Lane plans to give qualified U.S.-based investors access to funds providing exposure to direct equities, private credit and secondary transactions, which will be tokenized via Securitize's digital transfer agency, according to an announcement Wednesday. The firm expects the tokenized funds will be available by the fourth quarter.  The aim of tokenization is to make private market investment available to a broader set of investors. Private-equity investments are generally accessible only to institutional or ultra-high-net worth investors, but blockchain technology makes them available to individual investors, too.  The announcement by Hamilton Lane, which has $832.5 billion in assets under management and supervision, follows a similar move from KKR, the investment giant that announced plans last month to tokenize its Health Care Strategic Growth Fund on the Avalanche blockchain, also in partnership with Securitize.  Also last month, SWIFT, the messaging system that supports international bank transactions, formed a partnership with blockchain network Chainlink to develop a cross-chain interoperability protocol to facilitate token transfers across all blockchain networks.

GMX jumped to as high as $60 from around $40, data on crypto price tracker CoinGecko shows, the highest since January, when the price hit $62. The token has since pared some of the gains, changing hands at $48 at press time. Trading volume soared, reaching $150 million in the last 24 hours, almost 20 times more than the previous day, CoinGecko data shows.  GMX is a decentralized exchange (DEX), meaning that investors can buy and sell tokens on the platform without an intermediary by using smart contracts. The platform offers low fees and so-called zero price impact trading, which allows more capital-efficient trading without slippage, which is the difference between the expected price of a trade and the actual price.  The protocol gained popularity among cryptocurrency traders as it defied this year’s market rout. As other decentralized-finance protocols saw their total value locked (TVL) – an important metric for how much capital a platform can capture – deflate, GMX’s TVL has grown consistently, and now stands at a record-high $455 million, according to crypto data provider DefiLlama. Holders of the GMX token earn 30% of all the trading fees accrued on the exchange.  Notoriously, in early September, a savvy trader exploited a loophole on GMX’s smart contract code to manipulate the price of AVAX, the Avalanche blockchain’s native token, netting over $500,000 to $700,000 in profits, CoinDesk reported.

42394679,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASUvJH,1664974800,"Web3 Gaming Has a Long Way to Go Before It Becomes Mainstream, Survey Says","There’s a lot of money going into Web3 gaming. In the last year, hundreds of millions of dollars have been raised with the intent to deploy them into what the crypto industry views as the future of gaming. But despite the abundance of capital ready to be deployed there’s just one problem: Gamers aren’t interested.  Data from a new survey commissioned by Coda Labs shows that gamers (whom they define as those who play video games at least twice a month) are well aware of crypto and gaming – with 89% aware of bitcoin and 51% aware of NFTs – but have largely negative feelings about the asset class. Gamers ranked their feelings toward crypto at 4.5/10, and NFTs at 4.3/10.  As for intent to actually play a Web3 game, the numbers are bleak. The survey’s data shows that only 52% of gamers are familiar with any sort of Web3 gaming term, while only 12% of gamers have tried playing a crypto game.  Gamers cited practical challenges such as lack of familiarity with how Web3 games might work as a reason for not getting involved with them, the survey reported. Of those gamers that are familiar with Web3, they cited concerns over scams and start-up costs as a reason for not playing these games.  But the data also shows that there is a conversion funnel for gamers. Those gamers that eventually try a Web3 game tend to like it, with favorability ratings hitting 7.1/10.  “When regular gamers do give Web3 games a go, they tend to feel more positively,” said Şekip Can Gökalp, CEO of Coda Labs, which commissioned the survey.  The survey also noted that in emerging markets the perception of crypto is generally higher, with South Africans and Brazilians having a much more positive impression of the asset class than Americans, Brits or Japanese.  Will AAA-Studios give NFTs a chance?  While this survey shows that there is a path – albeit a small one – for crypto and NFTs to become part of the gaming industry, are studios interested in taking a risk on this new gaming paradigm when the first foray into it resulted in a high-profile failure?  Last year Ubisoft launched its first foray into NFTs alongside the game Ghost Recon: Breakpoint, but on-chain data shows that only a few hundred dollars worth of these tokens were sold and less than 100 transfers took place.  At the time of the launch Ubisoft called Quartz, its NFT platform, “the first building block in our ambitious vision for developing a true metaverse.”  But since then the studio’s enthusiasm for NFTs has been dialed back with its CEO Yves Guillemot saying in a recent interview that its still in “research mode” on the technology.  “We tested a few things recently that are giving us more information on how it can be used and what we should do in the universe of video games. So we are testing ground with some games, and we'll see if they really answer the players' needs,” Guillemot said. “As a company, we went into VR early, into the Wii early – we always try new things. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't work, but it's always to make sure we can bring a new experience to players that will be innovative and interesting.”  Of the two mediums Guillemot listed, VR and the Nintendo Wii, one turned out to be a niche market and the other a major commercial success.  VR started off as “clunky” when it first launched in 2016 and has shown continued growth every year since launch, but despite having an install base now in the millions, only 2% of PC gamers have one connected to their computers.  The Wii, on the other hand, was a risky proposition for Nintendo but its motion controller proved to be a crowd pleaser and drove it to be one of the best selling game consoles of all-time.  So the question is will Web3 gaming be a ‘VR’, a ‘Wii’ or something in between? As of now the data suggests that its going to struggle to be anything but a niche segment of the gaming market.

The company behind the popular multiplayer game Blankos Block Party announced on Wednesday that it's creating The Mythos Foundation to onboard and support new gamers and developers in its ecosystem. The new foundation includes a group of advisors from across the blockchain, gaming and entertainment industries, and includes Animoca Brands Chairman Yat Siu, Polygon Studios president Ryan Wyatt, 100 Thieves’ chief product officer Pete Hawley and others.  The Mythos Foundation will initially focus on five key areas of development, including cross-chain infrastructure, the evolution of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and game economies, support for gaming guilds, growing traditional esports participation in Web3 and collaborating with traditional gaming platforms to craft new policies for gamers at large. It will also manage the operations of the Mythos DAO, a newly formed decentralized autonomous organization that will provide its players with a voice in its ecosystem development.  Read more: What Is a DAO?  Mythical’s move to decentralize its platform aligns with the Web3 ethos it has put into its products. From creating NFT games to supporting developers through its backend platform, CEO and gaming veteran John Linden told CoinDesk that its mission to expand blockchain gaming is best accomplished through a DAO.  “We want to understand how we can use this technology to really improve our businesses…we started thinking heavily about [the foundation] and we thought it was very powerful, to really have this massive gaming alliance,” Linden told CoinDesk.  He added that the first proposal includes dividing the DAO into three subcommittees focused on game developers, esports and guilds, and Web3 and the metaverse. Within those subcommittees, groups such as game developer Ubisoft, esports group FaZe Clan, and venture capital firm Animoca brands will contribute to the governance of the DAO in those areas. Members of the subcommittees will need to be elected through the Mythos DAO by holders of its new governance token $MYTH, an ERC-20 token with a total supply of one billion.  “Groups can have different uses of the token as they see fit. But when we start building tech going into 2023, as the alliance is fully decentralized it uses that token as the primary utility token behind these new services,” said Linden.  Beyond an EVM-compatible governance token, Mythical Games has been seeking other ways to make its product operate on Ethereum. Last month, Linden said on CoinDesk TV that the company is building an Ethereum-compatible chain outside of its native Mythical Chain that operates on a fork of the EOS.IO chain.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MATIC | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2022/10/05/mythical-games-creates-mythos-foundation-to-decentralize-web3-gaming,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/772d2869210b2d4b622fae4c6a4592d55be66c10-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Roskomsvoboda's registry of blacklisted websites says Okx.com IP addresses were blocked by the prosecutor general office № 73/3-105-2022. The decision was made on Tuesday.  The reasons for the ban are unknown and no previous public comments related to OKX has been voiced by the agency. CoinDesk couldn't locate the original document, and OKX didn't respond to a request for comment.  The ban also can be found in the official database of Roskomnadzor, Russia's internet censorship agency. OKX's website was blocked according to the article 15.3 of the federal law, On the Information, Information Technologies and Protection of Information, according to Roskomnadzor's registry. The article covers public calls for extremist activities and information about organizations banned in Russia.  Roskomnadzor and Roskomsvoboda's names are similar as the freedom-of-speech advocates mocked the censorship's agency brand by replacing ""nadzor"" (oversight in Russian) by ""svoboda"" (freedom).  According to Artem Kozlyuk, founder of Roskomsvoboda, even the owners of blacklisted websites usually don't know why they have been blacklisted and can find out only by suing Roskomnadzor. Website hosting services, which are obliged to block banned websites, also know only about the fact of blacklisting. The only information publicly shared is the number of a decision and the article of law, Kozlyuk told CoinDesk.  OKX, which is the third-largest crypto exchange in the world by trading volume according to CoinGecko, isn't the first exchange that Russia has blocked. In June 2021, Binance's website was blocked by a local court, which said ""issuance and usage of bitcoins are fully decentralized, and there is no way to regulate it by the government, which contradicts the current Russian law.""  Binance, however, said it never received any complaints from regulators. In January 2021, the company successfully overturned the ban in court.  Russian government bodies and agencies have been scrambling to work out a universal approach to cryptocurrencies over the past few years. Crypto is recognized as a form or property by the law, On the Digital Assets, but it can't be used for payments in Russia.

MENA-based users received $566 billion in cryptocurrency between July 2021 and July 2022, a 48% increase from the previous year.  That growth compares with increases of 40% in Europe, 36% in North America and 35% in Central and Southern Asia.  The largest increase in percentage terms was in Egypt, where crypto transaction volume more than tripled. Chainalysis cited the devaluation of the Egyptian pound of 13.5% as well as the country's remittance market. Remittances account for about 8% of Egypt's gross domestic product.  Turkey accounted for $192 billion of the MENA's total of $566 billion, the largest share by one single country in the region. Chainalysis attributed that to the steep devaluation of the Turkey lira. The Middle Eastern country experienced inflation of 80.5% in the last year.  Elsewhere in the Middle East, cryptocurrency activity in Afghanistan has collapsed since last August following the Taliban's takeover there and subsequent crackdown on the industry.  Afghanistan was ranked 20th by Chainalysis for crypto adoption in 2021, with transaction volume averaging $68 million per month prior to the takeover. It now sits at less than $80,000 per month.

42393770,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpAnJT,1664969400,What’s Going On With Ethereum’s MEV-Boost?,"Soon after the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) blacklisted the Tornado Cash mixer program in August, Ethereum research and development firm Flashbots announced that it would, in accordance with U.S. Treasury Department sanctions, begin censoring transactions by means of a key piece of infrastructure used by many of the validators that run Ethereum’s proof-of-stake blockchain.  For many developers, writing code is a form of free speech and, as such, it should be protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. So when the U.S. government sanctioned the smart contracts affiliated with Tornado Cash, the action was seen by many members of the crypto community as an attack on free speech. Flashbots, by adhering to the sanctions, also fell prey to the community’s first amendment scorn. In response to the backlash, Flashbots raced to make open source its MEV-Boost code before the Merge so that others could develop their own, non-censoring versions of MEV-Boost relays.  This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum’s evolution and its impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Maximal extractable value (MEV) refers to the income that block builders and validators receive as a result of inserting or reordering transactions within a block. Researchers of MEV have tried to solve issues that have caused it to become an unexpected vector for user exploitation, centralization and (now) censorship.  Flashbots is a research and development team that has been working on ways to reduce the negative effects of MEV through MEV-boost, a middleware component that allows validators to request blocks from a network of builders. They designed it to enable validators to skirt MEV centralization while providing a good option for solving some proposer-builder separation problems.  But, in turn, the problem of block censorship appears to be on the rise.  Read more: As Censorship on Ethereum Begins, Could This Open-Sourced Code Help Counter It?  Flashbots’ dominance  Since the Merge, dashboards have appeared that monitor the activity of MEV-boost.  Three companies, Flashbots, BloXroute and Blocknative, make up the majority of relays for MEV-Boost. As of writing, of the MEV-Boost blocks that have been relayed, roughly 84% of them have been proposed via Flashbots.  A Flashbots monitoring dashboard shows that by early October 39% of all blocks that have been proposed on the Ethereum PoS blockchain have been put forth by Flashbots' relay, up from 12% right after the Merge. This number is only increasing day by day.  The Flashbots team has been relatively quiet on the subject of censorship, despite pressure from Ethereum developers and researchers who view the move as dangerous for the protocol. On Sept. 29, Robert Miller, the product lead of Flashbots, acknowledged the censorship outcry that has been circulating online in a tweet: “I hear you and appreciate the scrutiny.”  A Twitter thread also emerged last month with data published by Toni Wahrstatter, an Ethereum researcher, that looked at data created with the MEV-Boost relays. The data showed that as of Sept. 27, Flashbots has created 19,436 blocks since the Merge, all of which have censored Tornado Cash transactions. Other relayers, though, have also chosen to include Tornado Cash transactions; hence, these censored blocks appear to be forming the majority, regardless of which relayer is used.  While many developers have pressured Flashbots to uncensor their relay, Wahrstatter told CoinDesk, “Flashbots has been doing a great job in keeping MEV under control and they open sourced their MEV-boost software in time before the Merge, allowing competitors to enter the block-building market. This is important to stress, so Flashbots [is] definitely fighting on the right side. Now users can decide upon using the MEV-Boost relay of their preference.”  Martin Koppelman, the co-founder of the Gnosis trading protocol and a vocal advocate for uncensoring Tornado Cash, also pointed at a screenshot that he took, where from the 20 blocks he saw produced 11 of them were done by Flashbots, meaning they did not include Tornado Cash transactions.  Other MEV-Boost options  Other options for validators to be non-censoring are out there. BloXroute Labs is emerging as the next biggest relay provider after Flashbots. It currently runs three relays: BloXroute Max Profit, BloXroute Ethical and BloXroute Regulated, the last of which is sanctions compliant (meaning they censor Tornado Cash transactions).  CEO of BloXroute Labs, Uri Klarman, told CoinDesk that BloXroute “felt that deciding whether validators should or shouldn’t include [sanctioned] transactions is outside our pay grade” and that it chose to introduce a relay that censors Tornado Cash depending on users’ discretion and specific legal standing.  “You have BloXroute running relays that allow validators to choose which transactions they wish to include or exclude in the blocks offered to them,” Klarman added.  As for what Flashbots’ dominance over MEV-Boost means for other relays, Klarman noted that BloXroute is “in contact with every major validator, and quite a few of them told us they'll start by connecting only some of the validators and only to Flashbots, and expand as they grow comfortable with this new landscape.”  Klarman also added that censorship can become a non-issue only if “block builders and relays from other parts of the world would get traction with validators. But for this to happen we need to make sure validators connect to multiple relays, and not fall to ‘let's just use Flashbots.’”  It’s hard to imagine how the censorship issue will be resolved on Ethereum, especially as the use of Flashbots’ relay only continues to grow. Flashbots has not stated whether it would introduce an uncensored relay despite public pressure. Researchers and developers are still grappling with how to handle this MEV problem, and time will only tell how this will all play out.

At a Wednesday meeting, diplomats representing the bloc's member governments in the EU's Council signed off on the text of laws which were the subject of political deals struck in June, apparently without further discussion, a source briefed on the talks told CoinDesk.  MiCA introduces the first-ever licensing regime for crypto wallets and exchanges to operate across the bloc and imposes reserve requirements on stablecoins that are intended to avoid Terra-style collapses. A separate law on funds transfers requires wallet providers to check their customer's identity, in a bid to cut money laundering.  Since June, officials and lawmakers have attempted to turn the two political outlines agreed upon in June into a definitive legislative text.  Industry lobbyists were hopeful they could still clarify measures in MiCA that they feared could limit the trading of U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoins within the bloc.

42394671,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASUvCO,1664965985,SWIFT Says It's Proved It Can Be the Way Forward for Global CBDCs,"SWIFT, a key part of the conventional financial system that helps make cross-border payments between banks, has presented a framework for a global central bank digital currency (CBDC) system, claiming to have solved the challenge of interoperability between different networks.  Following experiments involving the central banks of France and Germany as well as HSBC, NatWest, Standard Chartered, UBS and Wells Fargo, SWIFT said it has carried out transactions between different blockchain networks, using both CBDCs and fiat currencies.  CBDCs aren't exactly cryptocurrencies like bitcoin (BTC), but they are cousins that share similar underpinnings: the distributed ledger system known as a blockchain that bitcoin pioneered. Central banks have for years toyed with the idea of digitizing fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar as CBDCs.  Amid those central bank experiments, attention has turned to how the CBDCs of different countries could interact when using different networks.  ""Blockchain networks could be interlinked for cross-border payments through a single gateway,"" SWIFT said Wednesday. ""SWIFT’s new transaction management capabilities could orchestrate all inter-network communication.""  SWIFT is a messaging system that supports international bank transactions. Its network is used in more than 200 countries by more than 11,000 financial institutions.  There have been suggestions, however, that digital currencies in the form of crypto, stablecoins or CBDCs could turn SWIFT into an also-ran. SWIFT therefore embarked on a series of experiments in December 2021 to demonstrate that it was ahead of the digital currency curve.  Alongside its work on CBDCs, SWIFT also explored tokenized assets, whereby assets like stocks and bonds are transformed into tokens that can be issued and traded in real time.  SWIFT said that it can serve as a single access point to different blockchains and that its infrastructure could be used to create and trade tokens across tokenization platforms.  CoinDesk recently reported that SWIFT was working with Chainlink, a provider of price feeds and other data to blockchains, on a cross-chain interoperability protocol to facilitate token transfers across all blockchain networks.

Pool Data’s market infrastructure, comprising payment rails that use the USD coin (USDC) stablecoin, as well as consumer-facing apps, aims to be a foundational layer for so-called “data unions,” the growing communities attached to apps that return control of data to users and mine value from it. These communities lack the means to scale towards making millions of small payments to individuals, for instance, Pool Data CEO Shiv Malik said.  The steady transition from the existing internet to a more crypto-friendly and decentralized Web3 world means the surveillance economy’s days are numbered. It’s an idea that’s close to the heart of Yang, who founded the Data Dividend Project to establish data-as-property rights under privacy laws like the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).  “We’ve seen over 120 share-to-earn data unions pop up, some of them with tens of millions of active users,” Malik said in an interview. “Andrew [Yang] has already taken a legalistic rather than a tech approach to data control and monetization, so Pool Data is a perfect project for him to support as a base layer rather than backing any particular data union.”  Yang says that while individual consumers are massively outgunned and out-resourced by trillion-dollar tech companies, the data economy is on the verge of a dramatic, once-in-a-generation shift.  “It makes sense for consumers to come together, pool their data, and form data unions that can negotiate collectively and command a fair share of the data economy for all,” Yang said in a statement. ""Pool Data is the best solution I have seen to solve the existing problems in the data economy because it provides the tools for data unions to form and scale.”",POSITIVE,USDC,MARKET | USDC,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2022/10/05/andrew-yang-an-ex-us-presidential-candidate-joins-web3-platform-pool-data-as-adviser,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2911a988eaf3bf02df128bae15c8569580131828-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42393767,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpAn45,1664953200,Italy Hasn't Vetted the 73 Crypto Firms It Approved This Year,"ROME — Italy may be rubber-stamping crypto firms’ applications to operate in the country without running proper checks to make sure they are safe for investors.  This summer, a string of prominent crypto firms – including Coinbase, Binance and Crypto.com – announced they had secured regulatory approval to continue operating in Italy. In effect, the companies were entered into a registry set up to ensure companies were compliant with the country’s anti-money laundering standards.  The Organismo Agenti e Mediatori (OAM), a supervisory body in Italy that maintains lists of financial agents like credit mediators and money changers operating in the country, has indeed been busy. While regulators are usually criticized by the industry for delays in processing applications, Italy’s OAM has quickly added 73 crypto firms – including the ones listed above – to its new roster for virtual currency service providers, which only opened in May.  When Coinbase was added to the OAM register in July, the firm said it reached “a key milestone” in the journey to serving European customers, adding that it had secured “approval from Italian regulators to provide ongoing crypto services to its residents.” Similar statements were issued by Binance and Crypto.com.  Obtaining regulatory approval or qualifying for registration with a local regulator tells investors that a company has been scrutinized by relevant authorities in the country. But in Italy, the “regulatory approval” alluded to in these statements may not carry the weight of assurance it implies.  Although registration with the OAM is now mandatory to continue operating in the country, no company was vetted before being added to the list. The OAM has confirmed to CoinDesk that it is still deciding on how to collect the relevant data from companies – and that it probably won’t start collecting information until next year. This means that Italy’s supervisory authorities are not currently monitoring the fund flows or controls in place to prevent criminals or bad actors from using these platforms to move money.  “Italy is probably, as far as I'm aware of, the jurisdiction with the most simple process. It's just a registration,” said Francesco Dagnino, managing partner at Lexia Avvocati, a Milan-based law firm that has handled the applications for around 16 out of the 72 firms on the OAM list.  Read more: Italy Formally Lays Out Crypto Firms' New AML Requirements  The Italian registration process is “very light” compared to other jurisdictions in the European Union and does not require compliance with any particular requirements – like operational integrity or anti-money laundering (AML) standards – for the purpose of the registration, Dagnino said.  For comparison, France’s Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF) requires companies to present four different forms detailing operations, executive management, significant shareholders and internal AML controls to earn a spot in the country’s equivalent crypto registry. Some global platforms like Binance and Crypto.com have also qualified for registration with the AMF as well.  Bitcoin, which came with a manifesto that promised to disrupt traditional finance back in 2009, may have predicted a crypto industry which prided itself in preserving privacy and evading the influence or interactions with the institutions and regulators that paved the way for the 2008 economic crisis. But the industry has come a long way, growing from niche networks to a multi-billion dollar global market.  As the crypto world ballooned, inviting more members of the general population into its complex folds, centralized trading exchanges began flaunting “regulatory approval” as a badge of honor – signaling to investors that these companies are safe and that they abide by anti-money laundering or investor-protection standards set forth by the jurisdictions they operate in.  In the dead of the coldest crypto winter on record, when some of the industry’s top players came crashing down along with market prices, the news of a regulator greenlighting a crypto platform seemed to carry even more weight than usual. When sports token issuer Socios said Italian regulators had approved it after the firm was added to the OAM list, football fan tokens rallied in the days that followed.  In its most recent evaluation, global AML standard setter, the Financial Action Task Force, said Italy’s current measures to counter money laundering are “extensive and mature” but “more effort needs to be devoted by supervisory authorities to ensure the legal framework is effectively implemented by reporting entities.”  A spot on the registry  In February, Italy implemented its new anti-money laundering rules for virtual asset service providers (VASPs) operating in the country. The decree from the Ministry of Economics and Finance mandated the creation of a special roster for crypto firms.  Once OAM opened the roster in May, all crypto firms already operating in the country and those that wished to enter the market had to apply for registration. VASPs that were already offering services to Italians were required to apply to be added to the registry by July 15. Once an application is submitted, the OAM has to approve or deny entry into the roster in 15 days.  The application requires the submission of 10 pieces of information which include the company name, a tax or fiscal code (easily obtained at an office of the country’s revenue agency), an email address, any physical points of operation including ATMs and a web address.  Most importantly, to qualify for the registry, the applicant must also provide a “registered office and, if different from the registered office, the administrative office.” If the VASP’s office is in another EU member state, a “permanent establishment” has to be set up in the Italian territory. Put simply, an operational office or physical point in Italy is a requirement to qualify for the registry, the OAM told CoinDesk in a written statement.  That doesn’t mean companies are actually setting up shop in Italy though.  Binance, for instance, has an address in the southern Italian province of Lecce, the register shows, under the entity name Binance Italy LLC. However, the company doesn’t have big plans for the office.  “We plan to open offices in Italy soon and are looking at options across Italy. The office in Lecce is only a formal step and, most likely, will not be the administrative office,” Simon Matthews, public relations director at Binance in Europe said in an email to CoinDesk.  Both Crypto.com and Coinbase have listed the same local address in the OAM registry: Stradello Marche 6, 43121 in the Italian city of Parma. A spokesperson for Coinbase told CoinDesk that the company does not have a “physical presence in Italy” and the address belongs to the company’s accountant. Spokespeople for Crypto.com did not respond to a request for comment.  Both companies have a “permanent establishment” in Italy, so they are compliant with registration requirements, OAM told CoinDesk.  Not a license  A place in the OAM registry is a promise that the company will be scrutinized by regulators in the future to make sure they comply with local AML requirements.  The operators registered in the roster are “legally recognized as legitimate services in Italy” according to the OAM, which added that it plans to start collecting “customer data” and information on “operations carried out” from the companies in the coming months.  “It's not that you literally get a license. It does not mean that you pass some particular scrutiny from the regulators,” Dagnino said.  Another big name on the list is Austria-based cryptocurrency exchange Bitpanda, which began operations in Italy in 2021.  “It should be remembered that registration as a VASP with the OAM is not the end of the process, but only a first step,” said Martin Erhold, public policy lead at Bitpanda, in an email to CoinDesk. “All VASPs will now be directly scrutinized for compliance with applicable AML rules and will need to demonstrate their setups are effective.”  Read more: Binance Sued in Italy Over Exchange Outages, Hearing This Week  Bitpanda was one of the companies that were operating in Italy well before the opening of the register.  “We already had a local branch and team in Milan… a prerequisite for us to operate appropriately in the market, so we were already subject to Italian laws, including local tax law,” Erhold said.  Binance declined to comment on tax implications.  Erhold described the OAM registration as a “simple and smooth” process, but said not all companies have followed Bitpanda’s path.  “Today we see that only a few leading players have registered and do not have a clear intention to localize operations in the Italian market,” Erhold said. He did not name any leading players.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | BNB,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/10/05/italy-has-a-registry-of-73-unvetted-crypto-firms,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9989173ec1f8e3ef284812f59fe9178d3d326a68-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Being a U.S. federally regulated crypto firm means added scrutiny actually works in Anchorage’s favor, and life is also made easier by having to only work with one regulator, the MAS, as opposed to the mix of watchdogs in the U.S., Mónica said in an interview with CoinDesk.  “Currently about 10% of our business is in the Asia region, but we are projecting it to become closer to 20 to 25% in the next 12 to 18 months,” Mónica said. “And I can tell you that working with regulators in Singapore is a breath of fresh air,” compared with the regulatory mishmash in the U.S.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | REGULATION,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/10/05/custodian-anchorage-adds-to-asia-push-with-batch-of-institutional-crypto-partners,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/02c6906c74cd6e317439ddff9cfdb21129c111d2-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin rose markedly for a second consecutive day and was recently trading at about $20,200, a more than 3% gain over the past 24 hours and its highest level in a week. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has crossed the psychologically important threshold several times over the past month but failed to stick amid investor concerns about inflation and the prospect of a harsh recession.  On Tuesday, markets responded positively to a surprising decline in job openings in the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS), which offered hope that the economy was slowing enough for the U.S. central bank to reverse course on steep interest rate hikes in the not-too-distant future.  Ether was recently changing hands above $1,350, up more than 5% from the previous day, same time. Other major altcoins spent much of the day firmly in the green with DOGE rising more than 10% after Elon Musk, a champion of the popular meme coin, indicated he would be willing to follow through on his original proposal to purchase social media platform Twitter. SHIB, a similarly dog-themed meme coin, and LINK, climbed over 4% and 5%, respectively.  The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based market index that measures performance across a basket of cryptocurrencies, recently increased by 2.4%.  Equity markets continued their so far buoyant week, with the tech-focused Nasdaq and S&P 500, which has a strong technology component, jumping 3.3% and 3.1%, respectively, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) rising 2.8%. Investors responded favorably to an unexpectedly small interest rate hike by Australia's central bank and the JOLTS reading suggesting that the hot jobs market was finally losing steam. Torrid job figures have concerned U.S. central bankers looking for signs of an economic downtrend.  The price of Brent crude oil, a widely watched measure of energy markets, traded roughly flat but still hovered over $91 per barrel, and investors will be eyeing Wednesday's report by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which is expected to cut supplies. Bond yields and the dollar, which recently soared to multi-year highs, fell again.  Bankrupt crypto lender Celsius Network's woes continued with the resignation on Tuesday of co-founder and Chief Strategy Officer S. Daniel Leon. He follows now-former CEO Alex Mashinsky, who departed the company last week. Celsius filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in New York in July and now faces an inquiry from an investigator appointed by the U.S. Trustee's office and authorized by the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York.  And Japan plans for expanding its digital presence will include non-fungible tokens (NFT) and metaverse services, Japan Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said in a policy speech Monday.  In an email to CoinDesk, Mark Connors, head researcher at Canadian digital asset firm 3iQ, wrote that despite this month's early gains across risk-on assets, markets remain unsettled. Connors called the S&P 500's 5.3% October increase a ""price action ... more indicative of an option or a warrant than a $32B+ large cap equity index,"" and said that the volatilities of currencies and treasury bonds were ""even more unusual.""  ""The low-vol, highly leveraged currency and rate assets are exhibiting the highest relative volatility,"" he said, adding: ""What you DON'T see are unusual moves in BTC or ETH. This is because monetary policy is causing problems in the fiat based plumbing. Asset prices are falling too fast.  ""This story is far from over.""

Insights  Kim Kardashian, EthereumMax and the SEC's Publicity Grab  By Daniel Kuhn  Monday, before the market opened, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced it settled with celebrity influencer Kim Kardashian for $1.26 million related to her paid endorsement of a cryptocurrency called EthereumMax. Just as when Kardashian first shilled the token in June 2021 (and failed to disclose the $250,000 she was paid to do so), the news raises the question … why? Why did Kardashian get involved in the first place, and why is the SEC fining her now?  The SEC, under Chairman Gary Gensler, is looking to send a message: Celebrities should think twice before endorsing cryptocurrencies. Kardashian, a celebrity who has built her reputation on being famous as well as ubiquitous, is a high-profile target. With a federal agency that is consistently underfunded going after this big target, the settlement serves as a warning for the crypto industry at large.

Influencers Are 'Easier to Pick Off' Than Token Issuers: Former SEC Official on Kim Kardashian  But the news also comes amid a deep market rout, where every day brings more news of crimes swept under the rug during a FOMO-fueled market rally during the COVID-19 pandemic. Three Arrows Capital, once thought to be one of the smartest hands in the game, was found to have built its fortune largely by rehypothecating borrowed funds. Alex Mashinsky, the founder and former CEO of bankrupt “neo-bank” Celsius Network was just found to be siphoning funds from Celsius.  Figures like Mashinsky and Three Arrow’s Kyle Davies and Su Zhu promised much more than Kardashian and other celebrity crypto endorsers ever could. Celsius’ unofficial slogan was “unbank yourself.” The Three Arrows hedge fund operated under the idea of an unstoppable crypto “supercycle.” Until the firm imploded under the weight of bad debt and bad bets, Celsius promised users returns of up to 20% on their crypto holdings. Mashinsky is now selling T-shirts saying, “Unbankrupt Yourself.”  Read the full story here.
