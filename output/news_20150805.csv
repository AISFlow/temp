42378276,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7YgRp,1438806704,Italian Banking Group: Bitcoin's Advantage is its Network Effect,"The European Securities and Markets Authority has published a number of responses stemming from a request for information on the topic of virtual currency.  The ESMA  , which regulates securities activity in the European Union, first sought submissions from the finance and digital currency industries in April. The agency published 14 responses from participants such as German megabank Deutsche Bank, Italian banking group Intesa Sanpaolo, regional trade group European Central Securities Depositories Association (ECSDA) and interbank messaging network SWIFT, among others.  The submissions  offer varied perspectives on how European regulators should approach overseeing activity on the continent. At the same time, the documents show how some of these organizations are adapting to the technology as it evolves.  Intesa Sanpaolo, like a growing number of banks worldwide, has gone as far as to establish an internal working group called an “Innovation Area” focused on cryptocurrencies as part of a broader effort to innovate on the technology side.  The letter noted:  “This Area is performing in depth research on virtual currencies and blockchain technologies. Through its dedicated task force, Intesa Sanpaolo is also implementing cryptofinance projects [and] integrating them with its strategic vision about the evolution of the financial services industry.”  The bank did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.  Bitcoin as potential ‘global standard’  Intesa Sanpaolo noted that among its possible use cases, bitcoin could function as a network for rights management, writing that ""[the bitcoin protocol’s] potential is far from being fully explored especially as a means to transfer rights and value in a very secure way"".  The bank went on to suggest that ESMA avoid using the phrase ""virtual currencies"", offering alternatives such as ""distributed ledger technology"", ""limited supply digital entitlement"", ""digital scarce asset"" and ""mathematical commodity"".  At the same time, Intesa Sanpaolo wrote that among both implemented and envisioned distributed ledgers, bitcoin itself remains “the first and the most important of Internet of Value protocol"", citing the adoption of TCIP-IP over alternatives as possible precedent.  The bank wrote:  ""There are high chances that it can establish itself as a global standard, as it leverages at least four powerful network effects: [the] bitcoin network has by far the largest hashing power (and so the greatest security), the higher capitalization, the largest user (and merchant) adoption, the best and largest developing and maintenance effort around it.""  The bank further argued that alternative algorithms, including proof-of-stake, are ""still not validated from both a theoretical and an empirical point of view"", stating that NXT and other networks depend ""on some kind of centralization in validation checkpoints"".  Call for dual oversight  The ECSDA, which represents 41 central securities depositories in Europe, said that it supports a regulatory regime for digital currencies, adding that such a framework ""needs to be developed to avoid ... disturbances to financial stability"".  Perhaps echoing a divergence to come as banks look at implementing bitcoin’s underlying blockchain for use as permissioned database instead of currency networks, it added:  “Looking at technological developments in conjunction with, but also separately from, virtual currencies and virtual currency investments, could enable securities regulators to find the right balance between promoting innovation and mitigating the related risks.""  On the other hand, the group said that its members from within the securities depositories industry are actively exploring the technology for use as a settlement mechanism but are not ready to disclose specific findings.  “Most of the work at CSD level however remains exploratory at this stage, and ECSDA is not yet able to share any conclusions,” it wrote.

42378268,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7YgJ1,1438795622,"No, Satoshi Nakamoto Hasn't Moved a Thing","Yesterday, social media lit up with the news that bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto had emerged from the shadows to make a transaction.  The mysterious figure is estimated to own somewhere in the region of one million coins, all mined during the currency's early months. His fortune, now worth $281.6m, has not moved in six and a half years.  Yet speculation bubbled after a user spotted what appeared to be signs that some coins had moved, according to data from Blockchain.info. The site displayed coins in bitcoin's genesis block, or 'block one', moving to an address created this year.  Despite initial excitement – and concern – from some, other users spotted a data discrepancy across alternative block explorers. Sites including Blocktrail, Blockr.io and others did not display the transaction, indicating that perhaps the movement didn't actually happen.  Observers have stated that the issue was due to Blockchain.info's API accepting transactions without validating them, eliciting criticism across social media platforms. The company later acknowledged the issue on Twitter, stating that more details would be forthcoming.    Funds attributed to Satoshi Nakamoto have not moved. They are unconfirmed by the Bitcoin network and likely spoofed. More details to follow.        — Blockchain (@blockchain) August 4, 2015      Earlier today a user took to Reddit claiming to have been responsible for the transaction, stating that he is a researcher from Central Europe who wanted to test the response to sending invalid transactions.  When reached for comment, Blockchain CEO Peter Smith characterized the event as a ""publicity stunt"", arguing that the network would have never validated the transaction.  However, the company has updated its API with a fix that Smith says will prevent a similar situation from developing in the future.  ""I think we can do a better job of filtering and we currently employ a lot of custom filtering rules so people don’t use our API for malicious purposes like spamming, dust transactions, etc.,"" he told CoinDesk. ""We’ve already implemented some new rules to make this kind of transaction impossible in the future.""  As it stands, it appears Satoshi's coins remain dormant – for now.

42378280,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7YgY7,1438782961,7 Politicians in Support of Bitcoin and Blockchain Tech,"With FinTech playing an increasing role in global affairs, it is perhaps not surprising that some governments and politicians are embracing innovations such as blockchain technology.  Just yesterday, CoinDesk reported Blockchain CEO Peter Smith was one of the 31 executives to participate in a trade delegation led by the UK's Prime Minister David Cameron to promote FinTech businesses in Southeast Asia.  This, however, is not the first time bitcoin and politics have come face to face.  Here's a list of some of the most high profile politicians to embrace bitcoin and blockchain technology to date.  1. Jared Polis  The US congressman first caught the attention of the digital currency community in March last year when he issued a satirical response to policy makers wanting to ban bitcoin.  In a move that would see him gain significant following among bitcoin enthusiasts, Polis argued that the US dollar should be banned, not the cryptocurrency.  During an interview with CoinDesk, he confirmed he would work to wade off the government's potential attempts to skirt bitcoin growth whilst in Congress.  He added: ""If there was an agency that reacted in an irrationally negative way to digital currencies, I would be happy to rally support [in Congress] to restrict their funding.""  2. Dan Elder  In July last year, Dan Elder – running for the US House in the state of Missouri – became the first Congressional candidate in the United States to fund his campaign solely in bitcoin.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Elder highlighted the digital currency's potential, noting it was a unique way of bringing integrity back to the notion of money.  The Air National Guard veteran and IT specialist said he saw bitcoin as a potential competitor against fiat, traditional centralised banking and the risky financial sector.  ""I'm accepting BTC donations to solely fund my campaign to take a stance against the Federal Reserve and its policies, which have weakened the US dollar.""  3. George Galloway  Across the pond, British politician George Galloway, Mayoral candidate for London, publicly announced his plans to leverage blockchain technology to track the Mayor of London's expenditure in a bid for greater transparency.  Galloway is pledging to run the capital's £17bn ($26.4bn) budget on MayorsChain; a blockchain-based public expenditure management system.  The eccentric candidate said on his funding page:  ""Now, for the first time, the radically disruptive technology of blockchains can provide a technological backbone for true, 100 percent transparency. Political accountability, it seems, is about to take on a whole new meaning.""  4. Andrew Hemingway  Andrew Hemingway, a Republican running for Governor in New Hampshire, has also proposed the use of blockchain tech during elections.  Hemingway spoke about the potential of distributed ledger technologies for voting after a Twitter follower asked about his views on voting IDs – a law that requires voters to have some form of identification before voting or receiving an election ballot.    2) @KrisWilliams81 we could apply the #bitcoin block chain algorithm to help solve this problem. Use the principle of distributed consensus        — Andrew Hemingway (@AndrewHemingway) July 10, 2014    Elsewhere, blockchain tech is also being eyed by parties in an attempt to transform the way in which voting takes place. Denmark's Liberal Alliance announced it was using blockchain tech for an internal vote at the party's annual meeting in Copenhagen.  5. Gulnar Hasnain  Gulnar Hasnain, a Green Party candidate running for Vauxhall, a district in Central London, became the first mainstream political candidate to accept bitcoin in the UK earlier this year.  Hoping to raise £1,000, Hasnain was taking donations from individuals using Onename and micro-tipping tool ChangeTip.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Hasnain noted she would like to draw attention to the positive aspects of blockchain technology and its potential to “transform democracy worldwide”, adding there were many similarities between her party and the principles of distributed ledger technologies.  “Surprisingly, the Green Party is vocal on the same issues as the bitcoin movement – more decentralised power, smaller government, a need for a shift in the concentration of power in the banking system and a more inclusive society.”  6. Rand Paul  Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, who officially announced his bid for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, started to accept bitcoin donations in April this year.  Describing him as a ""firebrand libertarian"", The Washington Post also dubbed his decision to accept donations in the digital currency a ""genius political move"".  The move – which sparked a media frenzy – came as a surprise to many as the candidate had previously shown a degree of skepticism about the digital currency.  During a TechCrunch panel earlier this year, Paul said he was ""an outlier"" on ""the bitcoin things"".  Paul confirmed his skepticism in a Bloomberg Newsreport, saying: ""I've been fascinated by the concept of it, but I never would have purchased it myself. I'm just a little bit skeptical.""  7. Rick Perry  Bitcoin welcomed another supporter from the political sphere just last month.  US presidential candidate Rick Perry shared his stance on bitcoin during an interview with The New York Observer, in which he stated his support for ""regulatory breathing room"" for digital currencies such as bitcoin.  While all the above politicians have talked the talk, we're yet to see whether they will walk the walk – will they take a pro-bitcoin or pro-blockchain stance if they gain a position of power? Or will all their encouraging remarks turn out to merely be one big publicity stunt? Watch this space.

42378278,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7YgUL,1438737567,Overstock Unveils Blockchain Trading Platform at Nasdaq Event,"Patrick Byrne, CEO of US online retailer Overstock.com, unveiled tØ today at the headquarters of the major US stock market Nasdaq in New York today.  The announcement marked the formal debut of tØ (pronounced tee-zero), Overstock's long awaited blockchain-based private and public equities trading platform first announced in 2014.  Byrne also unveiled a ""big surprise"" in the form of the platform's Preborrow Assured Token, which Byrne suggested would democratize securities lending. The product, he said, is already being used in an enterprise pilot program, and is the subject of interest by major banks.  Speaking to the crowd, Byrne explained the larger goals of the new platform and why he believes it to be a milestone in the history of trading:  ""We built a platform and we're launching tØ.com, where the trade is the settlement. That's the big disruptive idea, the entry is both the trade and the settlement, it doesn't have to be a separate process.""  Elsewhere, the event kicked off with talks by tØ co-founder Johnny Tabacco, Jones Day partner Lee Armstrong and Overstock president Stormy Simon, all of which sought to emphasize the innovative nature of the project and the genius of Byrne, who was described as a maverick, visionary and philosopher.  ""We had built a system that allowed couches to be hand delivered in a box, and back then, that was a hard conversation, helping retailers see how their business would be changed in the future,"" Simon said in her remarks. ""Today shipping couches doesn't feel like a big deal.""  Despite his staunch support for the bitcoin network, Byrne was also keen to stress that tØ intends to be ledger agnostic, meaning it can work with any decentralized ledger, he said, with a few weeks of integration.  Mentions of bitcoin were noticeably absent from most of the talk, even in references to the enterprise testing of blockchain-based trading systems such as those being developed Nasdaq, which explores how the bitcoin blockchain could be used to trade shares in private companies.  All attendees at the event, however, did receive $25 in bitcoin, an announcement that followed the main presentation.  History of trading  Following the opening speakers, Byrne used his talk as a forum to discuss changes in the nature of Wall Street trading systems, using simplistic analogies as a way to showcase the larger innovations that could be unlocked by distributed ledger technologies.  For instance, Byrne used an example where a grandmother sought to purchase a baseball glove from a neighbor, noting how in this instance trade is conducted directly and without any intermediaries.  Byrne then evolved the example to showcase how the same trades have been conducted by Wall Street, from the time of bike messengers, until later when these physical messages were replaced by computer systems, and ultimately, different representations of these trades.  ""True settlement would be, Grandma wants to buy a catcher's mitt and she gives money for the sale. Imagine that could be put on a public ledger,"" Byrne said.  He continued:  ""Imagine this ledger is cryptographically protected, public and transparent. Grandma's money can be turned into US dollar coins and when she buys the catcher's mitt, we're wiping out one coin and replacing it on another ledger.""  Rather than pose this innovation as threatening to Wall Street business models, Byrne sought to stress that tØ intends to license the product to enterprise trading firms.  ""We want to work with you,"" he continued. ""We think this is a much better system.""  Buyer beware  Byrne also sought to distance tØ from other competitors who are looking to sell blockchain-based products to the New York financial market, suggesting some may fall short of delivering on what he considers the true innovative nature of the technology.  ""This is all about true settlement, there's no need for net settlement,"" he said. ""If people come along and say they're introducing these crypto-based platforms, ask if it stays net. Other people working on such systems, some of the ones I know about will keep settlement net, I'm suspicious of why you would even do that.""  Building on this narrative, Byrne suggested that real gross settlement would ""make impossible"" certain wrongdoings that have become common in financial markets.  He also strived to frame real-time settlement as an original goal of Wall Street, one that is finally being made possible by distributed ledger technology, concluding:  ""That is what we've built at tØ.com and that's the original version of Nasdaq, a peer-to-peer (P2P) settlement system, this just happens to be based on new technology.""
