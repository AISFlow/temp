42379038,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mn2v,1480370468,Bitcoin Has Been Trading Above $500 For Record Six Months,"The price of bitcoin reached a new milestone on 28th November, as the day marked six consecutive months that the digital currency's price has traded above $500.  According to the CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), the digital currency first reached the six-month mark at 20:30 UTC, as it rose above $500 on 28th May. At press time, bitcoin was trading above $730 on the BPI.  This time frame represents the longest stretch in history where bitcoin has remained above $500. Even though the cryptocurrency surged to more than $1,100 in late 2013, reaching $1,165.13 on 30th November, it quickly fell back, declining below $500 on 18th December, 2013.  Even discounting this one-day dip in price demand, that period above $500 came to an end in mid-March, marking a sustained value above this market for just over four months.  Putting this in perspective, the digital currency has repeatedly displayed significant volatility, so its ability to remain above this crucial level of $500 for a sustained period might prove promising to those advocating the digital currency.  Some market observers have repeatedly criticized bitcoin's volatility, using it as evidence that bitcoin is not a ""real"" currency or sound investment opportunity.

42379050,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mmlJ,1480365615,EY Switzerland Will Accept Bitcoin Next Year,"The Swiss branch of global professional services firm Ernst & Young is set to begin accepting bitcoin payments next year.  Starting in January, EY Switzerland will accept bitcoin for invoice payments, the firm said last week. The company will also launch a new bitcoin ATM at its office in Zurich, as well as a dedicated wallet option for EY employees.  The launch is, perhaps, an extension of the ongoing cultural experiment involving the digital currency in Switzerland.  Late last month, Swiss railway service SBB made international headlines after it announced that it would sell bitcoin through its nationwide network of ticket kiosks. SBB is planning to test the purchase option over a two-year period. The city of Zug began accepting bitcoin payments for public services in May, and in the country’s capital, legislators have begun looking at the question of regulation.  According to EY, the launch fits squarely within this experimental context. Marcel Stalder, EY Switzerland’s CEO, said that the company wants its employees to have a working knowledge of digital currencies and blockchain. One way to do that, he said, is to provide ways to access a hands-on education.  Stalder said in a statement:  “We don’t only want to talk about digitalization, but also actively drive this process together with our employees and our clients. It is important to us that everybody gets on board and prepares themselves for the revolution set to take place in the business world through blockchains, smart contracts and digital currencies.”  EY is just one of the so-called Big Four accounting firms actively involved in the blockchain space today. It recently hosted a competition that led the firm to spotlight three startups that have been working with the technology.  Earlier this year, EY helped the Australian government auction roughly $16m in bitcoin confiscated during an investigation of a Silk Road user.

42379020,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mmhX,1480363313,German Central Bank Tests Blockchain Trading Prototype,"Germany’s central bank has built a new blockchain prototype focused on securities trading.  The Bundesbank developed the prototype in partnership with exchange operator Deutsche Börse, with further testing between the two sides planned over the next few months. The German central bank said today that the project constitutes the first joint initiative with Börse, describing it as “purely a conceptual study”.  The prototype is said to enable the transfer of both electronic securities as well as “digital coins”, as well as functions for coupon payments and the redemption of mature securities, using code from the Hyperledger project as a basis. Deutsche Börse is a member of that initiative, and has been exploring its own applications since early 2015.  According to the Bundesbank, the project is aimed at providing a basis for further exploring the use of the tech in the securities trading space.  Bundesbank executive board member Carl-Ludwig Thiele said in a statement:  ""With the blockchain prototype, the Deutsche Bundesbank and Deutsche Börse want to work together to find out whether this technology can be used for financial transactions, and if so, how this can be achieved. The Deutsche Bundesbank hopes that this prototype will contribute to a better practical understanding of blockchain technology in order to assess its potential.”  The unveiling comes on the heels of a four-day conference hosted by the Bundesbank in Frankfurt. The event brought together regulators like the European Central Bank and startups like R3 and Digital Asset Holdings.

42379023,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mmmZ,1480354386,A Major Insurer is Developing a Policy to Cover Bitcoin Exchanges,"A Japanese insurance firm is reportedly planning to launch a new policy line aimed at bitcoin exchanges.  According to Nikkei, Mitsui Suitomo Insurance is working with Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange bitFlyer to develop the policy. The publication reported that the insurer will offer as much as 1bn yen (roughly $9m USD at press time) in terms of coverage, with premiums ranging as high as “several million yen”. It’s not immediately clear when the insurance product would be launched.  The launch within Japan would be notable given the collapse of Mt Gox, the now-defunct bitcoin exchange that fell apart in 2014, resulting in the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bitcoin. While the Mitsui Suitomo policy would only cover a fraction of that amount, the launch could offer a degree of comfort to users, as well as regulators overseeing activity in the digital currency exchange space.  News of the insurance product comes as Japan’s financial services industry adopts a generally more aggressive stance toward digital currencies and blockchain.  Earlier this month  , a group of 42 Japanese banks joined SBI and distributed ledger startup Ripple to form a new cross-border payments consortium. Individual firms, particularly banks, have tested a variety of applications in recent months.  Japan’s government has set the stage for such action as well.  In October, local sources reported that national finance regulators were weighing whether to scrap a sales tax on bitcoin purchases. Regulators and members of the country’s legislature have already moved in the past year to rethink bitcoin exchange oversight.

42378997,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mkO7,1480347920,Why Aren't Bitcoin Businesses Talking About SegWit?,"By most accounts, the activation of Segregated Witness (SegWit) should be a boon for bitcoin.  The code has been introduced to the network, and at least 20% of bitcoin's hashing power is now signalling support for the software change. First proposed last December, SegWit is expected to provide the first significant boost in capacity to the bitcoin blockchain in its near-decade-long history.  While the mechanics of its rollout ensure that its implementation is not a forgone conclusion, to the technical community, SegWit is seen as a significant technical milestone. As described by Blockstream's Greg Sanders, the change (even at proposal) is one of the ""largest ever"" to the bitcoin code base.  ""It touched nearly every part of the codebase – serialization, peer-to-peer, wallet, codebase. That doesn't happen very often,"" he said at the Scaling Bitcoin conference this year.  Yet, despite the promise the technology holds, the bitcoin startup community has so far only tepidly embraced the idea that Segregated Witness will bring benefits. As summed up by Blockchain CEO Peter Smith, the view from consumer-facing firms that have seen usability issues while debate and testing were ongoing is more measured.  Smith told CoinDesk:  ""On the whole, SegWit is good technology that we are looking forward to deploying in our products if it activates. At this time, activation does not look certain however. Specifics aside, we're firmly in support of all scaling measures and generally are in favor of the bitcoin protocol evolving as quickly as possible.""  Smith's comments point to the effects of the months of public fighting that ultimately led to the introduction of the code, and the general sentiment among entrepreneurs that the bitcoin block size will need to be adjusted upward eventually to accommodate more users.  The viewpoint has contrasted with how Bitcoin Core, the software's main development project, has conducted work on the bitcoin protocol, which has seen it arguably prioritize optimizations that enable the software to be more effective within current constraints.  Regardless of how it was created, the resulting impasse has fostered the conditions under which bitcoin businesses aren't quite championing the change, however well-considered or beneficial it may be when (or if) it is implemented.  One bitcoin startup, for example, declined repeated attempts to discuss the news, with one of its executives ultimately explaining that there was ""little upside"" in commenting on the issue.  ""I'm guessing some folks just don't want to get in the middle of anything that might have to do with the Core roadmap, positively or negatively,"" he said.  'Political' climate  The lack of dialogue has not gone unnoticed.  Industry analysts like Cato Institute's Jim Harper said that SegWit has perhaps suffered from the poor state of community dialogue, which he critiqued as divisive and ill-meaning.  ""For me, this illustrates the crying need for greater social capital in the bitcoin world – deep research into every dimension of bitcoin as a technology and as a tool,"" he told CoinDesk. ""Reddit subs shouldn’t dominate, but should be second-fiddle to serious, carefully framed discussion in journals, academic conferences and among computer scientists, economists and other experts.""  The comments are supported by ample observational evidence.  Bitcoin now has two dominating Reddit forums (r/btc and r/bitcoin), both of which have shown a tendency to echo the MSNBC/Fox News-style schism observed in media more broadly. While r/bitcoin appears friendlier to Bitcoin Core, r/btc has championed alternative development teams, as well as the investors willing to devote capital to such explorations.  In this light, Harper credited the lack of dialogue to the ""extreme hostility"" that has characterized the debates ongoing in these environments.  This view was supported by Wedbush Securities research director Gil Luria, whose firm for years has issued forecasts on the potential market impact of the technology.  ""The reluctance of bitcoin companies to react to SegWit either way could be a result of the desire to keep options open and avoid getting unnecessarily involved in what is still somewhat of a political debate,"" Luria said.  Faint praise  That's not to say there isn't positivity about the changes in bitcoin's business community, it's just that there has yet to be a galvanization of sentiment around the issue (like, say, what happened when many startups spoke out against the New York BitLicense).  Smaller consumer-facing bitcoin startups appear more apt to be vocal about the protocol change, particularly because it would make way for other upgrades – including the Lightning Network and sidechains (both solutions expected to bolster capacity and functionality).  Respondents who met this profile were more likely to show an appreciation for benefits that would remove business pressures that have resulted from a lack of available block space.  Sebastian Serrano, CEO of bitcoin processor BitPagos, for instance, said he expected SegWit would reduce the time it would take partner companies to send funds, as well as reduce the cost his company pays in mining fees.  Even firms like Coinbase, whose executives have long been highly critical of the Bitcoin Core development group, offered praise (however faint) for the proposal.  The company said in a statement:  ""Coinbase is excited to see the bitcoin network scale and believes SegWit is a step in the right direction.""  The comments are notable given that Coinbase has been one of the more vocal critics of Bitcoin Core and what its executives perceive as their inability to adjust development timelines in accordance with business pressures.  Quiet adoption  Representatives of Bitcoin Core largely agreed that bitcoin businesses seem to want to ""quietly adopt"" SegWit without much fanfare.  In the face of critiques, the group has argued that the long rollout has been necessary given the strain of testing, as well as the burden it has placed on Core's working processes.  In Milan, Sanders spoke of the difficulty in coordinating activity. In one instance, he cited a situation in which there were too many Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) submitted, some of which had overlapping aims due to their sheer volume.  The comments point to perhaps a central disconnect in the larger public understanding of Bitcoin Core's processes, and how despite the nature of bitcoin as a well-oiled blockchain, its upkeep requires time and resources that (outside of the altruism of a few for-profit companies) is still largely volunteer.  In statements, representatives of the group disagreed with CoinDesk's findings, arguing our questions may have been disadvantaged by their intended public nature. In their survey of businesses, they said the business and startup community is ""widely anticipating"" the rollout of SegWit and its forthcoming benefits.  Bitcoin Core representatives further cited the fact that nearly 70 businesses operating on the bitcoin blockchain have indicated that they plan to upgrade to the code.  Bigger blocks  But comments from companies like Blockchain perhaps suggest that this technical readiness doesn't amount to a full-fledged endorsement.  In statements, Smith was keen to note that it remains a possibility SegWit won't be enacted. This remains a possibility that's both technical and political.  Due to the need for the upgrade to appear ""non-contentious"", SegWit requires that 95% of bitcoin miners show support for the upgrade consistently over a two-week timespan.  Complicating matters is that Bitcoin.com and ViaBTC, two mining pools with a combined 9.3% of the bitcoin hash rate, have pledged to support alternatives to the Bitcoin Core software that would more rapidly increase the block size.  Of course, both mining pools are comprised, in part, by independent miners who have joined the pools for profit, meaning that these miners could withdraw their support. But as of now, both could effectively stop SegWit from activating, Smith noted.  Other respondents put forward the idea that even with SegWit, future increases to capacity (and possibly block size) would be needed. (Members of Core agreed, citing it as a niche belief that bitcoin wouldn't ever increase its block size).  Bitflyer CEO Yuzo Kano, for instance, said he didn't know if SegWit would be ""sufficient"" to fix the ""block size issue"" stating that he is ""pro bigger blocks"" because he believes it would make bitcoin more user friendly.  The comments showcase how, despite the short-term divisions, there remains a still significant agreement in the project's overarching aims.  He said:  ""Increasing block sizes will be necessary sometime soon.""

42379014,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mkfj,1480339519,4 Criteria For Evaluating Blockchain ICOs,"William Mougayar is the author of ""The Business Blockchain"", a board advisor to the Ethereum Foundation and a venture investor.  In this opinion piece, Mougayar offers his thoughts on a new blockchain use case being evaluated – and used – by entrepreneurs as an alternative to traditional venture capital.  Initial cryptocurrency offerings, or initial coin offerings, (ICOs) are the flavor du jour in the sprawling crypto-tech market.  As I've described in previous writings, ICOs represent a fundamental shift in how companies get funded, at least when compared to the traditional venture capital driven methods.  What I inferred from that post is that the way forward is a clever combination of both worlds, the old and the new, a point that Zenel Batagelj from ICONOMI picked-up in ""ICO 2.0 – what is the ideal ICO?"" – a good post that I strongly recommend.  For background, I’ve already described the ""best practices for ICOs"" in a lengthy post two years ago. Its lessons still apply, but for a new reason: there are several more ICOs today than in early 2015.  I’d like to expand my own thoughts on how to evaluate an ICO by categorizing the criteria along four dimensions:  Startup characteristics  Operational transparency  Crypto-sale resiliency  Business model relationships  Arguably, the bar is higher now because if you want to comprehensively evaluate an ICO, you need to look at some new dimensions.  But at the same time, the bar can appear to be much lower because no one is forcing new investors to examine these four areas with the same required rigor that venture capitalists typically exercise, and specific ICO regulation appears to be lax or non-existent.  That’s where all the traditional VC stuff goes in. In a non crypto-tech world, VCs would continue their jobs as they always have, by making investment decisions based on evaluating startups, one at a time.  This is where the traditional ""team-product-market"" trifecta evaluation comes in, and I’m not going to rehash what happens in that dimension.  It often takes a career lifetime to perfect how to invest based on pattern recognition and drawing your own guideposts for making decisions. You can’t replace that, and you can’t fake it either. In here, you can add such topics as competition, go-to-market approach, product roadmap and implied valuation.  A warning signal emerges when newcomers start offering broad brush evaluations without having had the benefit of direct investment experience that includes lessons learned from having made good and bad decisions.  An additional requirement here is that someone evaluating the markets or solutions being targeted by these new companies needs to know something about the emerging crypto-tech space.  Many of these companies are not targeting traditional bricks-and-mortar or existing online markets.  Rather, they could be basing their models on the assumptions of a new ecosystem of blockchain-based users, applications and novel types of marketplaces, with new types of services that didn’t exist before (eg: identities, verifications, rights, smart assets, smart contracts logic, etc.)  Crypto-sale resiliency  Here, we enter crypto-tech territory. This part covers the sheer mechanics of the cryptocurrency sale, including its legal and regulatory aspects.  Some questions to ponder include:  In what jurisdiction is the company incorporated?  What legal structures are being disclosed?  What is the token distribution structure?  How is security handled?  What are the apparent, perceived or real regulatory risks?  Are there plans for external or internal audits?  If there is a DAO-like component, is its articulation realistic and well grounded?  Who has written up the token issuance contracts and actual token issuance software?  Which blockchain infrastructure is backing up their sale?  Have they published the terms and conditions of the sale in clear language?  Have you talked to at least three other entities who have successfully done a token sale before?  The non-profit advocacy group Coin Center has published a very good analysis that is worth reading. It mentions two important points to keep in mind: 1) tokens must be a utility to the operations of the business, and 2) they should only become available after your operations, not prior.  Operational transparency  I wrote this in February 2015:  With public money comes greater responsibility. Doing a public crowdfunding campaign is a two-way street. It’s almost like being a public company from day one. It’s not easy being in the public eye. If you can’t deliver the transparency, don’t take that path. And if we don’t self-govern to higher standards, the regulators will come and put a damper on this journey.  This is all still true, and it relates to how you plan on communicating progress visibility.  Some questions to ask:  Is the company providing public dashboards?  Does the company have independent auditors?  Are their delivery promises well articulated so that they could be later measured?  Does GitHub or another public repository reflect their progress, and has a given track record?  How will they continue to communicate their progress?  Are they blogging regularly about their work?  Are the team members well identified with links to their LinkedIn profiles?  Do they have external advisors?  Do you have plans to list your cryptocurrency on public exchanges, and which ones have you talked to?  Business model relationship  This is a critical part that should not be taken lightly, and it should be figured out early on.  It pertains to building a case for why a cryptocurrency model is the right path for this company. The basic premise is about how tokens are related to the business model of the company.  The token is supposed to tie everything together.  For example, in the case of the bitcoin blockchain, bitcoin as a currency is totally ingrained in that blockchain's operations, and it is at the center of a variety of actions: transaction validation, value exchange, miners rewards, store of value, transaction fee, currency for services, etc.  In the case of ethereum, ETH is used to reward miners, as “fuel” that funds smart contracts, and it is also a proxy to other tokens that can be created and managed on the ethereum infrastructure.  Fundamentally, some questions must be answered:  What is the purpose of the token?  What function or utility does it perform?  Is it absolutely necessary?  Can you describe a viable economic model behind it?  Here’s another important question that deserves its own dive:  How does value flow from the outside of the ecosystem to the inside, and vice versa (not counting speculatory trading on public exchanges)?  There are two types of segments for generating value:  Inside your own market  Outside of your market and into the cryptocurrency markets in general or the real world.  For example, can your users just spend and earn their coins inside or can they also spend them outside of your application?  If you are using a currency that has available liquidity (such as BTC or ETH), you benefit from the broader network effects of these currencies, but if you are creating have your own proprietary currency, your interdependency liquidity may take a little longer to materialize.  For example, steem has done a good job crossing boundaries between their cryptocurrency-governed site Steemit, and the real world, and demonstrated it at their recent Steemfest in Amsterdam.  Here are four examples I describe in a recent article, ""Steemit’s First ‘Fest’ Reveals the Power of Blockchain Community"" that showcase this cross-pollination of transactions between the crypto-world and the non-crypto spaces.  To quote from the piece:  “Many of the attendees paid for their travel using steem dollars they had earned on the platform, As a bonus, each attendee received a number of Steem Power as a reward for attending. Furthermore, a fund was made available to reimburse attendees in financial need. One small exhibit area featured Maurice Mikkers, a “tear catcher” who photographs your tear via a special microscope in high resolution for 25 SBD (Steem-backed dollars).”  Do you really need an ICO?  Amidst all the excitement generated by ICOs and the prospects of freedom from the strings of venture capital money, there is a fundamental question that must be asked:  Do you really need an ICO with its own currency or perhaps you may just want to use an existing cryptocurrency that attaches to your model, in which case the ICO might be burdensome and risky?  Of course, you can spin your own coin and hope the economics of the business model will natively support it for the long term, but you could also decouple the token from your model and treat it like a currency that is pegged to an existing popular one (eg BTC, ETH or STEEM).  On the positive side, despite the current Wild West appearances of the ICO market, some known best practices are emerging to create and evaluate ICOs.  Whether you are an entrepreneur planning for an ICO, an investor trying to decipher how to evaluate them, or a regulator pondering their future, do not ignore the guidelines proposed in this article.

42378999,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mkPN,1480307122,R3's Bank Exits Aren't Bad News for the Blockchain Group,"Noelle Acheson is a 10-year veteran of company analysis, corporate finance and fund management, and a member of CoinDesk's product team.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday, exclusively to our subscribers.  After a week of rumors and speculation, this much we know: Goldman Sachs, Banco Santander and Morgan Stanley (most likely) have left R3CEV.  The departures by three of the blockchain consortium's larger members is being taken by some as a sign that blockchain enthusiasm is waning, and consortia are losing influence. Neither viewpoint is accurate.  While we are not privy to the closed-door meetings that led to the respective decisions (which are apparently unrelated), we can deduce that the banks did not leave because they no longer believe in blockchain tech. Between them, they have published glowing reports, invested in blockchain startups, conducted trials outside of R3 and even filed one blockchain-related patent.  Some sources hint that they were unhappy with the terms of R3's latest financing round, but it's probable that they would have left soon anyway.  Why? Because of the nature of investment banking, and of consortia.  Goldman Sachs, Banco Santander and Morgan Stanley are major players in a highly competitive business. Participating in a consortium is not a natural fit, either in terms of style or objective.  Consortia work well in for-profit sectors if they focus on non-strategic areas. Collaborating with others offers synergies and economies of scale in testing new technologies, and when you’re starting out, exchanging knowledge can significantly accelerate the learning curve.  But when an area becomes strategic, the incentives change.  Differentiation becomes more important, and significant progress weakens the desire to share gains with those scrambling to catch up. As members gain experience and knowledge, they also gain confidence, and are less likely to be willing to give up competitive advantage.  Bullish signal  When the three banks joined R3 over a year ago, blockchain was probably not as high on their list of priorities as it is today.  In this light, their decision to ""go it alone"" can be interpreted as a declaration of the increasing strategic importance of the technology to their core businesses, and could even hint at an imminent roll-out of real-world applications.  It's also worth pointing out that the better a consortium does in terms of successful trials and media attention, the weaker it becomes. The greater the number of members, the more complicated its governance, and the more diluted the overall benefits.  A greater pool of knowledge is a good thing, yes, but it is difficult to effectively manage when not all the participants are at the same level.  Consortia will evolve  That's not to say all blockchain consortia are doomed to fail. Far from it.  In not-for-profit sectors such as credit unions, sharing is already part of the DNA. Country-specific consortia can wield more influence on regulation than individual institutions. And sector-wide groups can perform a valuable function, even if the benefits are transitory.  It's also unlikely that R3 is running out of steam.  Its funding round and the resulting structure do raise questions (is it becoming more like an incubator, or a blockchain services startup?), but are unlikely to stop the innovation. Over 70 members is still a drop in the ocean compared to the potential for future growth.  Governance will get more complicated, and we may see further regroupings and reshufflings. As the group continues to grow and as clients' priorities change, some will leave but more will enter.  In this case, increasing churn is not a cause for concern. On the contrary – it's exactly the opposite.
