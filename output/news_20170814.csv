The 2.59 million euro fine was passed down by the Italian Antitrust Authority (IAA), quasi-autonomous non-governmental organization that is funded by the Ministry of Economic Development. It comes months after the group moved to suspend the operations of several OneCoin-affiliated companies in Italy.  The companies were sanctioned for utilizing pyramid scheme tactics and misleading investors through promotional materials and events.  The IAA said in a statement:  OneCoin's dissemination took place through a pyramid sales system as recruitment of new consumers was the sole purpose of sales activity and was strongly encouraged by the recognition of various bonuses, the only real and effective remuneration of the program. The purchase of the training kit in fact concealed the entry fee required to enter the system and convince other consumers of the goodness of the product.""  Italy is the latest country in Europe to move to impose penalties against companies that promote OneCoin.  OneCoin, a purported digital currency, is sold via ""packages"" to investors who then redeem those packages for coins. Would-be investors are often encouraged to find others do buy those packages from them, adding fuel to the allegations that OneCoin is a Ponzi scheme.  Back in April, regulators in Germany effectively banned the scheme. Officials in Belize, India and Vietnam, among other countries, have taken steps against OneCoin in recent months.

Speaking in an interview with tech media publication The Verge, Dorsey described the technology as the ""next big unlock"", arguing that it has a plethora of applications beyond payments and the like.  ""There are so many problems we can help solve [with blockchain] that are not just related to finance, but finance is an obvious one,"" he told the site.  That said, Dorsey cautioned against trying to reach too far in applying the tech, decrying the push to try and solve ""every single problem with it.  He went on to say:  ""I think we need to be more thoughtful. What are people struggling with? How does the technology help them progress or does it distract them?""  Speaking about bitcoin specifically, Dorsey said that he's hearing from a number of people close to him about investing in those markets, expressing surprise at the degree of interest.  ""It's not about the currency at all to these people who asked me. It's about the investment,"" he concluded.

42427698,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL2yvh,1502730906,"$4,800: Goldman Sachs Analyst Thinks the Bitcoin Price Is Heading Higher","An analyst for investment bank Goldman Sachs said yesterday that the price of bitcoin could shoot as high as $4,800, comments that came amid new highs for the cryptocurrency.  Business Insider  reports that, in a client note distributed on Sunday, chief technician Sheba Jafari suggested that the price of bitcoin could shoot well past $4,000 given that it had neared a target of around $3,600 she set late last month. That same day, the price of bitcoin shot above $4,000 for the first time.  With that milestone hit, Jafari predicted, the price could climb to as much as $4,827. But she went on to caution that the market could correct, sending the price tumbling below $3,000.  Jafari’s comments come as the price of bitcoin continues to trade above the $4,300 mark. At press time, the price of bitcoin is roughly $4,328, an increase of more than 5 percent compared to yesterday.  Beyond predictions themselves, Goldman has been advising its client base that money, from their view, is moving into the market.  ""Whether or not you believe in the merit of investing in cryptocurrencies (you know who you are), real dollars are at work here and warrant watching,” a group of analysts for the firm wrote last week.

This incredibly exciting rise for the cryptocurrency market comes just four days after the crypto asset class set a previous record of over $116billion. There are a number of reasons that this increase happened; with the main increase appearing to be from a sudden increase in capital into Bitcoin; who in itself broke records by breaking through the $4,000 mark, increasing its value by more than twenty percent. Bitcoins is one of the markets oldest cryptocurrency, and is arguably one of the most popular and most understood. Although new currencies are coming onto the market, Bitcoin remains strong, and the value of the coin supply also rose in that time, climbing in value from $47billion to $57billion. Like we previously stated, other cryptocurrencies have come onto the scene, which have also seen very strong gains. The Neo, for example, which was formally known as Antshares, saw its market capitalisation pass $1billion for the first time ever. Neo has been watched, since it was introduced from China, and has been labelled as ‘the next best thing’. It is a recent redevelopment on Ethereum’s smart contracts, and uses a unique blockchain, designed to improve upon Ethereum’s model. In just one week, the market capitalisation rose from $550million to $1.7billion, and the price of coins climbed from approximately $10 to a staggering $34 in just seven days. IOTA saw a rather successful period as well, rising by $0.6billion, going from $1.1billion to $1.7billion. This is not surprising when you consider that IOTA has a number of great advantages over other Blockchain cryptocurrencies including the fact that it is scalable, decentralised and modular. Finally, Ether, which is the native cryptocurrency on the Ethereum blockchain, which also saw good profits, and helped the Cryptocurrency market rise to dizzy heights, after it increased its total market capital from $21billion to $28billion. One market that sadly cannot take the credit for the huge rise, is Bitcoin Cash, which was created in the recent Bitcoin fork.

42427685,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL2ydh,1502725555,New Bitcoin ETF Effort Launched by Money Management Firm,"A US-based money manager wants to launch an exchange-traded fund (ETF) tied to the price of bitcoin.  VanEck, which is headquartered in New York, is seeking to create the ""VanEck Vectors Bitcoin Strategy ETF"". The goal, SEC filings reveal, is to have the ETF listed on the Nasdaq exchange.  According to a preliminary prospectus published on August 11, the fund won't directly invest in bitcoin as is case with other ETFs tied to the cryptocurrency. Rather, it will purchase stakes in derivatives and financial products that offer exposure to bitcoin market developments.  As explained in the filing:  ""The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing, under normal circumstances, in U.S. exchange-traded bitcoin-linked derivative instruments (""Bitcoin Instruments"") and pooled investment vehicles and exchange-traded products that provide exposure to bitcoin (together with Bitcoin Instruments, ""Bitcoin Investments"").""  The ETF won't be limited to just bitcoin-tied securities, however. Beyond that, the fund will also invest in US Treasury bonds, money market funds and cash, among other possible assets, according to the prospectus.  The latest ETF bid comes on the heels of growing activity on the cryptocurrency derivatives front.  Last month, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission granted a derivatives clearing organization license to startup LedgerX, and options exchange CBOE plans to launch such products later this year.  Whether the SEC will approve the ETF remains to be seen, given that it's an area that the regulator has resisted in the past.  SEC officials shot down two separate bids in March, including one spearheaded by investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. In the latter case, the agency has since moved to launch a review of that decision, the results of which are expected later this year.

42427684,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL2ybh,1502723230,Legally Binding Smart Contracts? 10 Law Firms Join Enterprise Ethereum Alliance,"No, code isn't law, but if the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance's new members have anything to say about it, that might someday change.  Today, the alliance announced that ten law firms and four legal institutions that specialize in blockchain technology have joined the group. New members include Cooley, Debevoise & Plimpton, Hogan Lovells, Holland & Knight, Jones Day, Morrison Foerster, Perkins Coie, Shearman & Sterling and Cardozo Law School's Blockchain Project.  With the news, the new members have also joined the alliance's Legal Industry Working Group, chaired by Aaron Wright, co-director of the Cardozo Law School’s Blockchain Project.  However, the chairman of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance board of directors, Julio Faura, told CoinDesk the law firms will be working to ensure that blockchain-based technologies are more than just compliant with the financial system, but also with the power delivery and telecommunications industries.  Faura, head of blockchain research and development at Banco Santander, said:  ""If we're going to represent all of these things using smart contracts, and we're going to mimic the same properties that we have in the corporate world using smart contracts, then it's very important that we do it in a way that is compliant with today's laws and today's policies.""  Coming just weeks after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) released its first formal guidance on blockchain-based assets that might also be securities, the formation of the working group signals the desire by some parts of the industry to play by the rules.  Other industries, other blockchains  First revealed in July, the Legal industry Working Group is chartered to educate the legal industry about the potential benefits of blockchain technology, and to develop and standardize private versions of the ethereum blockchain.  Working in partnership with several existing members – BNY Mellon, Intel and JPMorgan Chase – the group is designed to ensure that ethereum smart contracts and assets comply with regulations and are legally binding.  He continued:  ""We're not trying to change the whole economic fabric from traditional systems to a blockchain. What we are doing is we are trying to use blockchain to reflect the reality that we have in our system, in the economic world in general.""  And not only are different industries in the group's sights, but also the broader ecosystem of blockchains. Faura believes the implications of the group will expand beyond ethereum at some point.  ""I'm sure this is going to have a big impact on all aspects of using blockchain in real-life situations,"" he said.  Benefits for lawyers  While members believe the financial industry, power delivery systems and telecommunications businesses could be digitized and put directly onto a blockchain, the business benefit for lawyers may seem less obvious.  But founding member, Lewis Cohen of Hogan Lovells, contends there are advantages for legal institutions. There's a learning component, one that his clients don't want to pay for but expect him to know, especially as state governments around the world continue to weigh in on blockchain.  The need to know the difference between ethereum, Corda and any number of other distributed ledgers will only grow.  Cohen told CoinDesk the working group is a way for him to stay on the cutting edge for his clients, stating:  ""I think it's incumbent for lawyers in this space to educate themselves, and there's no better way for lawyers to educate themselves than to be a part of this working group.""  Since the early days of blockchain-based self executing code – when some argued ""code is law"" – coders and lawyers alike have become increasingly sophisticated.  Not only is more being expected from smart contract code, but the workflows within institutions are being reimagined. And as smart contracts are entrusted with increasingly sophisticated tasks, Faura expects lawyer's roles will grow, not shrink as some have worried.

As CoinDesk previously reported, BTC-e – the long-running and mysterious bitcoin exchange that was taken down late last month following the arrest of one of its alleged operators – has said it plans to pay back user funds held by the exchange.  Posting via cryptocurrency forums and Twitter, those involved say they have regained control of just over half of the funds tied to the exchange. Further, echoing a previous effort by bitcoin exchange Bitfinex, which issued a token to users after it lost $60 million in bitcoin to a hack last summer, BTC-e says it will distributed tokens to cover the deficit.  Among the new detailshttps://forum.bits.media/index.php?/topic/44942-update6-14082017/, BTC-e says it will offer free trading in a market for those tokens (called BTCT), through which users can sell at the prevailing rate. The tokens will trade at ""any price, but no more than their face value,"" the representative said.  The post goes on to explain:  ""For example, you had 1 BTC. You will receive 0.55 BTC and 0.45 BTCT. 0.55 BTC you can output immediately. The remaining 0.45 BTCT you can either exchange for BTC at the market rate, or wait for their exchange at face value.""  In an earlier post, BTC-e said that it was in the process of obtaining outside capital to support the exchange relaunch. As part of that process, BTC-e has indicated that it will rebrand, though what name the site will use remains to be seen.

Richard Sandor, a former Chicago Board of Trade chief economist and vice president, advanced the utilization of financial futures back in the 1970s, earning him the moniker ""the father of financial futures"" and, later, ""the father of carbon trading,"" according to Time.  Notably, perhaps, Sandor is now listed as the first of three inventors for the ""Secure Electronic Storage Devices for Physical Delivery of Digital Currencies When Trading"" patent application, released on August 10 by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.  Sandor is currently the chairman and CEO of Environmental Financial Products LLC, which is listed as the applicant for the patent. The application itself details a hardware concept for the storage of digital currencies tied to derivatives contracts.  It explains:  ""The invention relates to a method to facilitate trading of digital currencies, which comprises electronically storing an amount of a digital currency on an electronic storage device or electronic registry; and physically storing the storage device or electronic registry in a secure, physical repository that is not publicly accessible with the storage device or electronic registry available for use in subsequent delivery of the digital currency.""  It's the latest submission to focus on cryptocurrency-related derivatives, coming on the heels of news that options exchange CBOE is planning to launch products in this area later this year.

42427705,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL2z5h,1502709317,What the Fork? Why Bitcoin Tech Changes Impact Price,"Bitcoin can be an intimidating place for the new investor.  Scrolling through your news feed, you're more than likely to be greeted by apocalyptic headlines and strange terms – and you might not immediately understand the risks either poses to your investment.  Take the term ""forks,"" for example. They're certainly a pertinent issue without an analogue for more traditional investors. So, what exactly is a fork? And why are they so important to the value of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies?  The simplest answer is that all cryptocurrencies are software, and that a fork is a change to that software.  When you own an asset like bitcoin, what you really own is just a pair of network password keys. Those keys represent the ability to access the network that keeps track of who owns what and how much.  As such, when that software is modified, it can change the value of user's claims dramatically. In a very real sense, the software itself defines the asset – and, therefore, the price that investors are willing to pay for it.  An example  While there are many types of forks, most are relatively simple in nature.  A hard fork makes transactions processed on the new software incompatible with the previous versions. In a soft fork, the new version remains backwards compatible.  Earlier this August, bitcoin experienced a high-profile hard fork when a subset of the community split off the software and created a new version called bitcoin cash.  The contention came from bitcoin's move toward a certain scaling upgrade, one which the bitcoin cash contingent was against. With two competing and incompatible ""bitcoin"" blockchains and ""bitcoin"" assets, analysts anticipated considerable price volatility, with many believing that prices would trend down.  But, that's not what actually happened.  On August 1, right before the blockchain split, bitcoin was trading at $2,759, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index. More than a week later, bitcoin was trading at an all-time high above $4,100. At press time, the price had passed $4,230.  While that might seem odd, several analysts theorized that bitcoin's long-drawn-out scaling debate had posed a major headwind, and its culmination led to a relief rally.  Data shows the bitcoin cash price shooting up to around $700 24 hours after the blockchain split, but because of market dislocations, it's difficult to know how reliable that data is.  In the following two weeks, the price of the new cryptocurrency has mostly hovered between $250 and $300.  The old narrative  While all this may sound a little wonky, the underlying narrative of headwinds and tailwinds should be familiar to anyone who has invested even casually.  In market terms, a headwind is a risk factor or negative trend that is likely to push prices lower. A tailwind represents just the opposite – a positive movement, a bit of favorable news, or a halo effect caused by some underlying trend.  Headwinds are often discussed when risks come into play that are specific to a company. When the risks diminish, the headwinds are said to subside, and the price of the stock often rises. Stock investors see this sort of rally in the stock market on a fairly regular basis.  The classic example of a headwind is when a company settles a lawsuit or agrees to pay a fine to end a government or regulatory investigation.  Markets despise uncertainty, so when a potentially risky situation gets resolved, investors often see it as a buying opportunity.  In the cryptocurrency space, most analysts have tended to think of forks as a headwind – an event that threatens to destroy value. As such, it's reasonable to expect cryptocurrency prices to rise after the headwind created by a potential fork subsides.  Turning tide  Yet, this thinking is showing signs of shifting.  Every holder of bitcoin on August 1 had the potential to automatically receive an equal amount of bitcoin cash as part of the fork. So, if bitcoin cash is trading at $300 and bitcoin is trading at $3,000, bitcoin holders have received an additional 10% value because of a software change, all with no additional investment.  But, what if the rise in bitcoin prices after the fork isn't a simple case of an asset price rising because risk has been reduced? What if investors don't see forks as net destroyers of value, which must be discounted with lower prices, but as potential net creators of value?  In this scenario, the total value of bitcoin increases as new cryptocurrencies based on different technologies bloom. When investors hold on to cryptocurrencies in the face of potential forks, it's possible they aren't just weathering a storm, they're emerging from the rain with a richer bouquet of assets in their portfolio  In that case, some forks may be poised to transform into a classic tailwind which could drive prices ever higher.  If we take price to be a reasonable proxy of sentiment, then the forks-create-value view of bitcoin is clearly ascendant right now.

According to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, average prices across exchanges today opened at $4,111 and have seen a 4.97 percent increase so far. At press time, a bitcoin was worth $4,315  Notably, since the price passed the $4,000-mark for the first time yesterday, prices have maintained a level fluctuating at around $4,100, only dipping to below that level once when bitcoin was trading briefly for around $3,900. However, prices soon returned to above the $4,000 point.  The record-breaking price levels would seem to indicate money coming into the market that had been held back pending the uncertain outcome of a split of the bitcoin network that resulted in a new cryptocurrency called bitcoin cash.  Bitcoin cash, which was created on August 1, already stands as the fourth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and currently has a value of around $306, according to CoinMarketCap.  The total market cap of all cryptocurrencies has again reached previously unseen levels, and has now reached $138 billion – a billion higher than yesterday's all-time high.

42427707,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL2zBh,1502701244,Know Your Tokens: Not All Crypto Assets Are Created Equal,"Dr Pavel Kravchenko holds a PhD in technical sciences and is the founder of Distributed Lab.  In this opinion piece, Kravchenko explains the ins and outs of cryptographic tokens, what kinds there are and how each kind is different.      What we understand by the term ""token"" is actually best defined as the balance of some kind of account.  But, perhaps most importantly, it's a balance that can really mean anything its founder wants it to mean. To date, tokens have been made to represent a user's reputation within a system (augur), a deposit in US dollars (tether), the quantity of files that are saved in it (filecoin) and the balance in some internal currency system (bitcoin).  Because of this, I sometimes argue that tokens don't even exist – mostly, because I want to draw attention to the fact that they always have a very specific meaning.  If we want an analogy, tokens can turn everything that we're used to seeing in paper form – including shares, and money and promissory notes – digital. But the terms we will use for these things will remain unchanged (shares will still be shares). The fact that crypto assets are stored in a decentralized accounting system, or require digital signatures, doesn't change their meaning or value.  As such, the problem that is emerging isn't with the actual terms themselves, but that people have begun to assign attributes to tokens that they can't possibly have.  There are people who claim that cryptocurrency tokens are something entirely new – and that projects that issue tokens can become amazingly transformed.  Sadly, that's not the reality.  Tokens and tokens  In computer terminology, the term ""token"" has long meant one of two things: a gadget that can authorize a user (such as a dongle or a special thumb drive), or a fixed array of symbols that identify a user (such as an API key).  In both situations, tokens can pass between different owners. So, how are cryptocurrencies different from the tokens we know?  Generally, the term ""crypto asset"" means one of three different things:  A cryptocurrency with decentralized issuance and transactions.  A digital asset, issued into a decentralized system, and secured by either someone or something. This version can be split into two further subdivisions: either the accounting system isn't trusted; or the issuer isn't trusted.  Something that's both issued and validated by the same organization, yet not backed-up by anything.  We can sum up all of the above possibilities in one simple diagram:  Bitcoin handles processing and transaction processing entirely transparently, and in a completely decentralized way – because people would not trust an anonymous system under any other circumstances whatsoever.  Tether handles processing entirely transparently (even better than the bitcoin network), but users must trust that it is faithfully issued (each token is 100% backed up by cash money on a bank account).  Any centralized land registry demands that its users trust it in aspects of correctness of accounting – yet there are no issues on the question of issue (since new land can't be produced from thin air, and all land already exists).  Types of tokens  So what kinds of token are there? And how do they differ?  A token can fulfil either one, or several of the following functions:  A currency, used as a payment system between participants.  A digital asset (a digital right – to land ownership, or tomatoes in a warehouse, and similar assets).  A means for accounting (number of API-calls, volume of torrent uploads).  A share (stake) in a specific start-up.  A way of rewarding main players (the best example is bitcoin).  A way of preventing attacks (such as commission within the bitcoin network).  Payment for using a system.  Yet because there are so many options it may be hard to classify any particular token; they are often a cross between shares, an internal currency and accounting units.  Tokens that are directly linked to shares in a company, for instance, don't need further consideration; they are completely identical to shares. More complex are so-called ""utility tokens.""  Let's remember, this kind of token is used as way of making internal payments – yet their price can rise due to limitations in their issue, and due to rising demand. It's precisely due to this dual functionality that it's hard to define exactly what they are. Sometimes they behave on markets as though they are shares, yet regulators treat them as accounting units.  Alongside this, people can sometimes use these to make payments to each other.  The best definition for ""utility tokens"" is the one put forward by Vladimir Dubinin (my business partner). He compared the pre-sale of tokens with the sale of government bonds in US dollars. These bonds are denominated in the national currency, and profits from them will be paid out in that currency too.  These bonds, it seems, will be sold at a heavy discount, but if they go well, the currency rate might rise quickly.  In this light, we shouldn't forget that no nation whatsoever is keen to see its currency becoming too pricey because this leads to a sluggish economy and has a negative effect on the balance of payments.  Questions for investors  I'd say the main questions for investors are these:  What does this token represent?  Is it a share, an internal currency or an accounting unit?  What would cause the value of this token to rise?  Is it limited issue, or do you need to hold tokens to complete each transactions when using a product?  What's the potential for growth? Does this product have potential to be needed by everyone on earth?  Will the product remain in demand, say, if the token costs $1,000? In other words, couldn't the product's popularity become its own Achilles' heel? For example, if a transaction costs 1 token, at a price of $1,000, then would that be a reasonable and affordable price for users?  Could that same product continue to exist without the tokens for it? Bitcoin, for example, couldn't function without the bitcoin token, yet Ripple could easily do so.  In short, it's worth doing an analysis of this kind when looking at tokens as part of a long-term investment portfolio, rather than when buying with a view to speculating.  My own personal feeling is that the market for crypto-assets remains rather overheated. It could be better to hold off the moment for getting into this market.

42427704,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL2z7h,1502700305,Blockchain and Education: A Big Idea in Need of Bigger Thinking,"Noelle Acheson is a 10-year veteran of company analysis and the author of CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday, exclusively to CoinDesk subscribers.  In this opinion piece, Acheson discusses upcoming regulatory changes in Europe, explaining how trends in payments rule-making may unexpectedly align with those in the blockchain sector.      You've probably been there: an interview, either for a job or university admission, with the interviewer sitting across from you scrutinizing a piece of paper that holds your credentials. And you can't shake the feeling that she doesn't believe you.  It turns out that interviewers are right to be skeptical. According to a recent survey, over half of resumes and job applications contain falsifications, and over three quarters are misleading.  This past week, Sony revealed progress on the development of a blockchain platform to store and share education records. Developed in conjunction with IBM, the service aims to reduce fraud and make it easier to share the information with third parties for recruitment and assessment.  The goal is worthy. Education credentials have largely resisted the pull of technology, and are still held in diverse formats on siloed databases distributed around the world.  However, Sony's plan to partner with select institutions misses the bigger opportunity: scalability and impact.  Credible credits  For credentials to be useful, they need to be universally recognized and verifiable. In the case of education, this is still largely a manual process that often involves paper documentation and case-by-case checking.  A blockchain platform can help with the trust and distribution issues, but, in an incongruous twist for a decentralized technology, that could well mean adopting a centralized solution.  So, why use a blockchain at all? Couldn't an immutable database with access privileges do the trick?  As always, it depends on the overall vision. It's fair to assume that Sony's intention is to start small and then scale up to include a vast range of educators. So, further down the road the ease of data sharing and updating offered by a distributed ledger could be an important factor.  However, even then, the targeted and permissioned approach is likely to encounter scaling bottlenecks and quality control issues (who decides which institutions deserve to belong?).  Furthermore, it could evolve into a ""two-tier"" system, in which some of the more progressive and wealthy schools participate and others don't. Or, even worse, it could open up the market to a chaos of competing systems with different technologies and criteria.  Aim high  A faster and more reliable path to widespread adoption would be to partner with the organizations responsible for deciding which educational institutions are trustworthy: the official education accreditors.  Most jurisdictions have them (some have several), which means that the work of validating the education has already been done. However, there is limited collaboration and significant duplication between them, something that a blockchain platform could help with.  The accreditors could be tasked with managing the system, updating university access and validating credential types.  What’s more, they would be better placed to recommend adjustments in light of sector shifts. As new types of universities and forms of study emerge, the nature of certification is changing. In addition, ""lifelong learning"" is becoming more than a buzzword, as skill sets need refreshing and career paths become more flexible.  A platform managed by organizations well positioned to spot trends and needs, with a ""top-down"" approach rather than a piecemeal, ""bottom-up"" strategy, would be able to better satisfy the requirements of an evolving marketplace.  It would also boost the confidence of both employers and students – and in so doing, could end up contributing to a more flexible and qualified labor force.  That’s a tall order for any new technology. But the need is clear and the upside substantial, assuming the initiative ends up being open, universal and fair.  While it is important to test and iterate, small solutions are likely to end up creating even more silos and tiers. As with the related field of identity, the impact lies in thinking big.
