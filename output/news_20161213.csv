42379071,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7muKZ,1481650862,Digital Currency Exchange Kraken Acquires Bitcoin Buying Service,"San Francisco-based digital currency exchange has acquired wallet funding service Glidera.  The acquisition of Glidera, the terms of which were not disclosed, is the latest for Kraken, which has spent the past year snapping up other startups in the exchange space.  In January, Kraken announced that it had bought New York-based exchange Coinsetter, which itself had moved to acquire CAVirtex in April 2015. In June, the exchange expanded its European footprint when it announced the purchase of CleverCoin, based in the Netherlands.  As part of the integration of the two services, Glidera – which enables users to purchase bitcoin via their bank accounts and send the funds to the wallet of their choice – will be rebranded under the name “Kraken Direct”. The service offered by Glidera will, by extension, be open to Kraken’s international customers as well.  In a statement, Kraken CEO Jesse Powell said that the deal “rounds out a fantastic year for Kraken”.  He went on to say:  “We’ve seen incredible growth throughout 2016 across all areas of our business. We’re looking forward to an even better 2017 with this acquisition and our new ‘Kraken Direct’ service playing a key role.”  The global exchange saw acquisitions elsewhere this year, including the purchase of BitInvest by Brazil-based Foxbit. In February, Finnish bitcoin broker Prasos announced that it had bought Coinmotion for an undisclosed amount.  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Kraken.

42379084,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mucB,1481643923,Blockchain in 2017: Do We Know What We Don't Know?,"William Mougayar is the author of ""The Business Blockchain"" and a board advisor to, and investor in, various blockchain projects and startups (See: Disclosures).  In this CoinDesk 2016 in Review piece, Mougayar reviews what we do and don't know about the real-world uses and likely effectiveness of blockchain technology.  Self-awareness is bliss, in life and in business. Part therapy, part philosophy, it is a psychological state of mind that carries with it several benefits. For one, the more you know about yourself, the better you are at adapting to changes.  The blockchain is no different. Left to its own devices, the blockchain space has plenty of reality distortions.  To kick-off this year-end series, I'm going to try and provide a balanced reality check about where we are in the blockchain’s evolution, as I ask a simple, yet inquisitive question:  As we enter 2017, do we know what we don’t know about the blockchain?  No predictions. Just reflections.  To answer the above question, I will highlight a few areas while categorizing topics along two dimensions: the strategic and the tactical.  Strategic unknowns  Where are we in the cycle?  Pick your flavor of cycle theories- Gartner’s hype cycle, Carlota Perez’s theory of economic development, or Geoffrey Moore’s crossing the chasm. There is no disputing we are in the formative years of any one of these cycles, but where exactly?  When will blockchain adoption take off in terms of users, applications variety, steadiness and predictability of growth patterns? From my vantage point, we haven’t crossed the chasm, nor are we in the wide installation phase of the technology, and we aren’t even past the peak of inflated expectations.  To be more accurate, where we are exactly will be visible only in the rear-view mirror, when we’ll be able to look back. In the meantime, we’ll need to keep plowing, knocking every obstacle, and picking ourselves up at every seemingly failing moment.  Will we need a real crash in order to adjust our expectations?  If the Internet is a precursor of blockchain history, the year 2000 crash was a momentous event because it flushed out what was hyped, reset expectations, and allowed cool heads to prevail during a new and renewed phase that ensued.  That new phase was dubbed Web 2.0 and appeared around 2003, ushering an ever-lasting phase of Web prosperity and growth thereafter. In retrospect, that was about seven years into the Web’s 1993 real appearance.  With the blockchain, some have already started using the label Crypto 2.0, but that might be a premature moniker for where we are in the blockchain’s life.  I firmly believe we are still exploiting a Blockchain 1.0 era of sorts, despite the nuances of its own evolution. Perhaps only a real crash would shake things up enough and substantiate a real entry into the new phase of Blockchain 2.0.  What are the blockchain’s boundaries?  Do we know where the blockchain will apply and where it won't? What will work and what will never work? We really don’t know, but we need to keep pushing the envelope and going off the edges in order to realize where the limits are.  I am seeing many cases where the blockchain is being thought of, but it looks like a solution waiting for a problem that is not there.  For example, the healthcare field as a whole has been touted as a perfect sector for the blockchain, but we have not seen real progress or practical blockchain implementations.  Specifically, I often hear that the blockchain is going to solve the synchronization issues in the patient medical record, yet there is little realization that solving the medical record puzzle has other non-blockchain related issues that must be addressed first.  Will the blockchain have an impact on the firm?  Distributed Autonomous Organizations (DAO’s) put into question our traditional thinking about managing organizations, but we still don’t know if these early implementations could propagate into any traditional organization, or if they would remain in the domain of blockchain-based businesses.  Will the concept of decentralized organizations that are tied to blockchain technology influence how a firm is organized? And to what degree? We haven’t yet totally figured out blockchain governance, yet we want these early examples to model how the firm needs to be run.  Automating governance and automating operations are not the same thing, but in both cases, we need more experience in modeling and running parallel systems before declaring that we know how the firm’s organization will change.  What will be the blockchain’s contribution to the GDP?  We have no idea. For comparison, in developed countries, the Internet economy contributes anywhere from 5 to 12% of a nation’s GDP, and that was accomplished 23 years after the Web’s advent.  Yes, cryptocurrency-based companies are emerging, but what will be the compound effect on real wealth creation across countries, industries and economies? We know that the total value of cryptocurrencies hovers roughly at the $15bn mark as of the end of 2016, but that is the only quantifiably measurable metric relating to wealth creation.  Will the crypto-tech economy follow a similar path as the Web economy in being its own force of economic strength? I certainly hope so, but we are in the early innings of this evolution.  Will blockchain-based identities have a future?  How many blockchain identities  will we have is an interesting question. One answer is that we’ll likely have as many blockchain identities as we currently can hold real ID cards in our physical wallets, combined with the number of online identities we possess. This is because a blockchain identity crosses the physical to online world due to the potential melding of the trust factor between these two semi-artificial boundaries.  Blockchain-based identity holds a promise, which is to allow us to consume a number of services in a trusted manner, without the need to assert our physical presence, like remote voting for example.  What will be the killer app for blockchain-based identity: voting, trading, social applications, e-commerce, consumer services, or others? Are we going to end-up with a variety of identities or will a handful emerge? Will bonding our reputation be a romantic linkage, or will it have a real value?  Can we really codify law?  There are big expectation for blockchain-based smart contracts. Will they be able to dispense money, change conditions, and enact decisions? Maybe it’s easier to codify existing law and we should start there, instead of creating new laws while we also attempt to codify them before they are proven.  Can smart contracts govern company operations, decisions, stakeholders, and future directions? We must be careful in not rushing smart contracts implementations where we don’t fully understand the implications of their potential failures.  In the case of the much publicized DAO rise and fall, too much autonomy was entrusted into fledgeling smart contracts, and the process took a turn that was humanly unstoppable (except via a hardfork).  Autonomy seems to be a stubborn goal of DAO’s, as zealous engineers want to give power to their smart contracts, just because money, business rules, responsibilities and decision-making can now be programmed all together in a big mashup.  Will we see the equivalent of a smart contrast in-chief that governs other smart contracts? Is Turing completeness a benefit or weakness of smart contracts?  Will blockchain networks be more secure than existing banking networks?  In light of the continued blockchain-related security hacks (eg: The DAO and Bitfinex, to name just two recently visible ones), a fundamental question is front and center: will we eventually take blockchain security for granted, just as we take bank grade security for granted? Or is it too early in the maturity cycle of blockchains to expect total security resiliency?  There is no reason why we shouldn’t expect blockchains to be as trusted as what is commonly referred as “bank grade security”, although we are not there yet, today. However, we should be reminded that real banks have had a rich history of robberies starting with the 1800’s during the Wild West era in the US, and there are continued successful bank robberies, thefts and hacking exploit, up this day.  Eventually, the frequency of blockchain security vulnerabilities should be an artifact of the past, because security is an essential condition if blockchains want to become big.  How will blockchains interact with each other and with the physical world?  That is a loaded question that we are barely starting to tackle and with expected breakthroughs in 2017.  Will there be standard way to access off-chain data? Will decentralized oracles become provably honest retrieval sources by centralized services? Will various blockchains inter-operate with each other at the asset exchange level or via other types of linkages? Will the Internet of Things take off when we connect it to blockchains? Will there be other flavors of blockchains in addition to the popular public and private one? How will the blockchain record and update physical status? Or should we optimize for on-blockchain activity? Will moving assets across blockchains be like the nightmare of integrating multiple databases or will it be a lot easier?  Will big companies play outside their operations?  The innovator's dilemma is an omnipresent hurdle for large companies. The Internet was no exception to it, as we saw few large players reinvent themselves with the Web era. Instead, a number of industry sectors were hit broadside by the Internet: newspapers, retailers, bookstores, travel agents, stock brokers, lenders, payment processors, post offices, and others saw their business radically altered by the Internet.  With blockchain implementations, large companies could keep busy for the next 10 years, reengineering their operations to benefit from cost savings and process improvements due to blockchain-based solutions, but will they go further outside of their comfort zones? Will they implement what’s under their nose and in their current operations?  If central banks who have been tinkering with the blockchain adopt cryptocurrency, will it be as an experiment or as something they truly believe is in their future?  Tactical Unknowns  When will we see widespread consumer adoption?  Where are the consumer applications that don’t require users to have any technical knowledge of the blockchain? Early cryptocurrency wallets are very natively close to the blockchain and not user-friendly enough, at least not for mass consumption.  Maybe there’s a Web equivalent to the blockchain that we are still waiting for. It was the World Wide Web that provided this user-friendly layer where users didn’t have to worry about connecting computers together in order to benefit from the information availability.  Will we be able to shift the conversations from the technical realm into the business one?  What will be the regulators’ role and impact?  For the most part, regulators have not been too heavy-handed yet. But they are bound to place their marks on the blockchain, eventually. What is not known is whether they will innovate, update, experiment, support or tamper with blockchain innovation.  The right regulatory updates could provide a great boost to blockchain implementations. There are new theories for blockchain regulations that place regulators as a node on the network, just like any other peer, allowing it visibility and transparency into a slice of transactions which they can observe and react to.  However, we have yet to see official regulators taking these types of positions, and we still need to see more regulatory sandbox experiments bear their fruit.  Does proof of work have a long-term future?  Will proof of work (POW) scale indefinitely or will a new consensus method such as proof of stake or delegated proof of stake replace it? Do we know all we need to know about the economics and safety of this popular consensus method?  A corollary to that first question follows: will miners continue to play a key role or will their place become threatened? Furthermore, will it be possible to create a public blockchain that isn't dominated by a few mining interests?  Let us be reminded of what Tim Berners-Lee said when they decided to make the Web technologies totally open: “You can’t propose that something be a universal space and at the same time keep control of it.”  Finally, will it be possible to have a secure blockchain without a valuable token as the incentive to secure it, without calling that a permissioned private blockchain?  Are ICOs a boon or will they bust?  Currently, new Initial Cryptocurrency Offerings (ICOs) are launching with a frenzy not unlike the Internet rush to IPO’s during 1999, when half-baked companies or ideas hurried to get listed, only to later face the ugly brutalities of public markets.  Choosing the ICO route via a public crowdfunding campaign is almost like being a public company from day one. It’s not easy being in the public eye, and companies that can’t deliver high standards of transparency shouldn’t take that path.  Amidst the uncertainties in evaluating ICOs, we really don't know if this trend will become a normative way to raise funds when a cryptocurrency is involved.  Furthermore, we are still trying to validate the various roles that a cryptocurrency (or token) plays in it: is it a proxy for network effects, an intrinsic utility, a reward, or a speculative instrument?  What standards will emerge?  In 2016, waiting for blockchain standards has been like waiting for Godot, but that was not such a bad thing. Imposing standards too early may be hurtful to the blockchain industry, because we need to see the technology blossom a little further.  The topic of blockchain standards is complicated, and it extends beyond just seeing it as an interoperability challenge. We will probably need a set of technical, business and legal types of standards, but we really don’t know which ones they are yet, or which existing ones need to be updated instead of being completely re-thought of.  Technology innovation will always outpace regulatory and standards bodies who want to freeze-frame it in order to put their stamp on it. But if you try to frame a moving picture too early, the resulting optic will be distorted and you will want to replace it soon after.  What will be the impact of quantum computing on the blockchain?  In theory, quantum computing could lower the security resiliency of blockchains because it threatens to break the strength of encryption.  Will quantum computing be a force to reckon with, or will blockchain encryption also benefit from it and strengthen itself accordingly, rendering the net impact as a neutral one?  What will the new intermediaries look like?  We define the blockchain as being a peer-to-peer network for value flow without central intermediaries, but the reality is that new intermediaries are emerging.  Much of the blockchain activity is focused on financial services, as many startups see banks as the disappearing intermediaries, but outside of financial services, what other industry sector will show good use cases for the blockchain? Government, energy, healthcare are good contenders, but real implementations are few and far in-between.  Will linking physical assets to blockchains get accomplished without introducing trusted third parties?  Will consortia succeed or be a stepping stone?  There are at least 25 various consortia across various sectors and industries, all of them vying to provide collective benefits to their members.  Consortia are hard. Pulling diverse companies to work together is not easy. You need disciplined processes, persistence, patience, a tolerance for some politics and lots of maturity.  At best, they level the playing field among participants and help to move forward collectively. Therefore, consortium work doesn’t offer a competitive advantage, which is why most participants will need other blockchain initiatives in parallel.  Will group initiatives deliver on their promises or will they end up being a bridge into other types of activities?  Will cryptocurrency redefine the attention economy?  We are increasingly spending our time in online activities that we don’t get paid for, but will we continue to give our time away for free?  Social media for example is a benevolent time consuming activity that has no direct financial paybacks. What if we injected cryptocurrency into these activities as a new unit of value? Will it be a good enough incentive that brings benefits and quality improvements?  Is cryptocurrency the missing fuel that could re-energize the attention economy?  What will the shape of private blockchains be?  What does a world of competing blockchains look like? Or will they all work together harmoniously?  If there were more than one Internet, it would have undoubtedly not blossomed the way it did. Certainly, the path to multiple blockchains and distributed ledgers is currently being paved, but we still don’t fully understand how the needed network effects would be affected by a multiplicity of blockchain networks.  Is the only form of private blockchain the consortium one, or will there be other forms perhaps similar to the private website where one firm runs its own blockchain application to serve its private customers?  Keep looking further ahead  The intent of this reality check was not to be negative, but to be grounded.  It’s always good to know about the headwinds you face, even when experiencing the feelings of hope and excitement.  Optimists would like you to believe. Skeptics want you to forget. Realists (like me) encourage you to think hard and be aware.  The proverbial jury is still out for many of the issues that I have enumerated. To bring these thoughts into the practical, I encourage you to take on a personal assignment for whatever blockchain activities you are involved in: make your own list of unknowns, and think of a path to remove uncertainties and turn them into known issues.  Then, talk to people outside of your blockchain spaces. Ask them what they think of your projects and ideas. Like kids, they’ll say the darndest things, but they will tell the truth and ground you back to reality.  After more than two decades in operation, we can say today that the Web has been largely tamed, as there are few unknowns to it (except perhaps for the vague mysteries of hacking). In contrast, the blockchain terrain is boiling with uncertainties, although not insurmountable ones, and will remain so for a few more years, until a given maturity is reached.  Uncovering the known unknowns was only the easy part. The harder part will be to discover the unknown unknowns, but to get there, we will need to wait yet another year!

42379066,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7muI3,1481639427,Bitcoin Wallet Blockchain Adds Ex-Barclays Chief to Board,"Bitcoin wallet startup Blockchain has added former Barclays Bank group chief executive Antony Jenkins to its board of directors.  The appointment is notable as Jenkins served as Barclay’s chief executive from 2012 until mid-2015. There, he was promoted to the top spot in the wake of the Libor scandal, a plot involving numerous banks aimed at manipulating interbank interest rates.  With the move, Jenkins becomes the latest financial executive to take an interest in the industry, following heavyweights such as Blythe Masters, CEO of Digital Asset, and Duncan Niederauer, former CEO of the New York Stock Exchange.  In a blog post announcing the move, Blockchain CEO Peter Smith praised Jenkins, detailing a 2015 speech during which the ex-Barclays chief expounded on how technology would ""radically"" change the face of financial services.  Smith went on to write:  ""I wanted to collaborate with Antony for a simple reason: wisdom to navigate crossing the chasm from a simple, burgeoning technology to enabling a whole new financial ecosystem. From a timing perspective, it felt right.""  Jenkins would go on to put the predictions behind that speech into practice, as the move comes weeks after he started his own fintech startup, 10x Future Technologies, which develops cloud-based banking software, according to Business Insider.  In a statement, Jenkins echoed those past remarks.  ""Blockchain technology has the potential to reinvent the way we use money and contribute to a finance system that’s high quality, low cost, secure, fair and transparent. I am proud to join a company playing a pivotal role in ushering in a new era,"" he said.

42379064,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7muFX,1481637710,Bitcoin-Powered Marketplace OpenBazaar Raises $3 Million,"The developers behind OpenBazaar, the open-source marketplace protocol powered by bitcoin, have raised $3m in new funding.  The new round was led by BlueYard, a Berlin-based VC fund with a focus on early-stage startups that has strongly indicated its support for decentralized markets in the past. VC giants Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures also took part.  OpenBazaar is like a decentralized eBay, connecting buyers and sellers directly through an application-based marketplace. But instead of PayPal or credit cards, the market utilizes bitcoin as a medium of exchange.  The project grew out of an earlier iteration, dubbed DarkMarket, which won the Bitcoin Expo hackathon in Toronto in 2014.  OpenBazaar 2.0  The new funding comes more than a year after the startup that develops OpenBazaar, OB1, raised $1m in seed funding from Andreessen Horowitz, Union Square Ventures and angel investor William Mougayar, who sits on the startup’s board.  The round caps a busy year for OB1, which officially launched the service in April following months of testing. Some of the early listings on the market included caramel waffles, accommodations in Taiwan and marijuana seeds.  According to OB1 CEO Brian Hoffman, the next year should be just as busy.  He said of the new funding:  “After launch we were so excited to see how people have been using OpenBazaar, and with this new funding we’re confident it will allow us to bring the benefits of truly free and open trade to the world.”  Hoffman told CoinDesk that the funding will help the startup continue expanding its suite of services, describing it as a kind of “seed 2.0” round.  Major items in the pipeline include OpenBazaar 2.0, along with plans to develop value-add services (with an eye to monetization) and integrate with Tor, the anonymous communications network.

42379085,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7muVt,1481634063,Blythe Masters Talks 'Tipping Point' for Business Blockchain Adoption,"Blythe Masters may be helping to lead an industry-wide shift in the development of blockchain tech, but that doesn't mean her startup isn't experiencing its own changes as well.  No longer content with building tools that have the potential to make industry more transparent and streamlined, Masters is one of a number of blockchain innovators in pursuit of talent and customers as part of an effort to help make the tech's theoretical business applications real.  Epitomizing the shift, Masters' heavily funded startup, Digital Asset Holdings, last week published a white paper with a subtle, but important difference: non-experts can understand it. Marking a transition in the company's focus, the simply titled paper – ""The Digital Asset Platform"" – isn’t written for developers that build tools, but for executives with the power to change the direction of a financial institution.  In conversation with CoinDesk, Masters laid out her company's efforts to capitalize on the white paper's impact, as well as its plans to give away part of the technology described to nurture an ecosystem of companies and strategy to maximize market share.  She said:  ""We're at a tipping point where this technology is turning mainstream and this technology needs to be understood by a more mainstream audience.""  But, in spite of the focus on this audience, Masters hasn't significantly changed the company's internal organization in preparation for customer requests. Instead, she believes the New York-based firm that has raised $70m in funding will be able to rely on its existing resources.  With partners that already include the US-based Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, Switzerland-based Six Securities and the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX), she believes her company's infrastructure will be able to meet increased demand.  With numerous predictions that the banking industry will begin to implement real-world blockchain applications as early as next year, Masters said the white paper is more about giving technologists the tools to explain their work to corporate decision-makers.  The result of sales pitches to customers and investors alike, the paper underwent over 100 edits to refine the technical language describing the platform down to a 29-page document that explains everything from Digital Asset's distributed ledger platform to the creation of open-source libraries by third parties based on the DAML smart contract language, according to Masters.  ""When you engage with us, when you sit and have a conversation with us, these are the things that we talk about,"" she said. ""Having it written down means it can be leveraged in a way that we had not done before.""  Decoding the platform  Masters said many of her potential clients have been acutely aware of the potential threat and opportunities that blockchian posed, but how platforms such as her own could help empower those institutions was less clear – something the white paper is intended to clarify.  To help map out the potentially disruptive and helpful forces of distributed ledger technology, the white paper breaks down Digital Asset's ledger into two components.  The first sets out its Global Synchronization Log (GSL), which relies on a blockchain to preserve the privacy of counterparties and notify them of changes to the state of a smart contract. The GSL was covered in greater detail in another white paper published in November.  The second component of the ledger, though, has received much less attention. The so-called Private Contract Store is a virtual container for all the validated smart contracts and terms to which the counterparty has agreed.  The non-technical white paper is Digital Asset's account of its service as a ""fully centralized solution"". To initiate adoption, only the ""operator"" of the infrastructure needs to adopt the firm's platform, leaving participants to interact as they do in a traditional network.  Think of it as distributed ledger training wheels: though the centralized adoption minimizes the benefits of the distributed ledger, the operator can begin the process of familiarizing users with the technology while leveraging its more transparent method of transacting.  Regulatory tools  Beyond aspects such as illustrating the creation and use of smart contracts, Masters said the white paper is targeted at showing how regulators too can benefit from distributed ledger tech.  Not only might regulators such as central banks become customers by using the platform to build a blockchain-based fiat currency, Masters said, but they will be capable of auditing the work of financial institutions.  Auditors and the market operator could be granted access to ""re-execute"" any contract's business logic to ""interpret and validate the information"", according to the white paper. Digital Asset calls this ""distributed reading"".  ""The role for regulators to act as auditors – or in the language of the white paper, to become market participants – is an option and very much one of the positive features of the technology,"" said Masters.  However, the business-friendly white paper also lays out potential regulatory hurdles – warning of a potentially difficult transition period. Absent a single operator, a distributed network with multiple entities managing nodes could also increase risk, at least initially.  The paper states:  ""Transitioning from a currently centralized infrastructure to a multi-operator network relying upon a consensus algorithm potentially expands vulnerability by increasing the opportunities for network exploitation and would likely be more challenging for regulators to approve in the near term.""          Giving away blockchain  To accelerate the rate at which such obstacles are overcome, Digital Asset plans to join a growing list of firms competing to give away the software on which their products are built.  Even as Digital Asset seeks to protect some of its intellectual property with a patent strategy, the shift in language of the white paper is part of a plan to lure developers to help create a vibrant ecosystem around the firm's platform. In August DA announced its plans to contribute the DAML smart contract language to the open-source community.  The exact date of the open-source launch has yet to be revealed.  Already, blockchain banking consortium R3CEV has open-sourced its Corda platform and it is soon expected to formally submit the code to the non-profit Linux Foundation’s Hyperledger consortium. Last week, after Chain open-sourced its own blockchain protocol, the startup unveiled its Ivy smart contract language with similar plans to make that open source.  Masters said that while she believes the world, generally speaking, will be improved if blockchain tech is implemented widely, the decision to open-source DAML isn't purely humanitarian.  Giving away the software ""reduces the risk"" for existing and future customers by preventing the firm from becoming ""overly proprietary"" and ""mitigating"" the chance of ""vendor-lock in"", she explained.  ""We're very focused on the open-source community, making sure that our platform becomes progressively more open and therefore any dependency on Digital Asset can be diversified if necessary,"" Masters said.  The result, she hopes, is a larger piece of the market share of companies competing to provide blockchain solutions.  She concluded:  ""In the future, there will continue to be customers that engage Digital Asset to build them a solution that addresses a particular use case. There will also be others that merely make use of the underlying platform and choose to develop their own solutions by building their own libraries and applications.""

42379074,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7muPb,1481630955,CFTC's Giancarlo: How US Regulators Can Boost Blockchain in 2017,"J Christopher Giancarlo is a commissioner of the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). He was nominated by President Obama on 1st August, 2013, and was sworn in on 16th June, 2014.  In this special feature for CoinDesk's 2016 in Review, Giancarlo discusses why he believes the US needs to rethink its blockchain policy for 2017 and beyond.  I spoke a lot about distributed ledger technology (DLT) this past year because I believe in its promising benefits for the financial marketplace and financial regulators.  DLT may help market participants manage the enormous operational, transactional and capital complexity brought about by the legion of disparate mandates, regulations and capital requirements promulgated globally in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.  For regulators, DLT may help transcend the fragmented regulatory structure by providing reference to a single, verified record of all financial transactions across regulated markets.  In order for this technology to flourish, however, regulators must come together and set uniform principles to encourage DLT investment and innovation.  That's why, earlier this year, I outlined five practical steps that, my agency, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and other financial regulators should take to encourage DLT and other financial technology.  Put our best foot forward: Financial regulators should designate dedicated, technology savvy teams to work collaboratively with FinTech companies – both new and established – to address issues of how existing regulatory frameworks apply to new, digital products, services and business models derived from innovative technologies, including DLT.  Allow 'breathing room': Financial regulators should foster a regulatory environment that spurs innovation similar to the UK Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA) sandbox, where FinTech businesses, working collaboratively with regulators, have appropriate “space to breathe” in developing and testing innovative solutions without fear of enforcement action and regulatory fines.  Get involved: Financial regulators should participate directly in FinTech proofs of concept to advance regulatory understanding of technological innovation and determine how new innovations may help regulators do their jobs more efficiently and effectively.  Listen and learn: Financial regulators should work closely with FinTech innovators to determine how rules and regulations could be adapted to enable 21st century technologies and business models  Collaborate globally: Financial regulators should provide a dedicated team to help FinTech firms navigate through the various state, federal and foreign regulatory bodies and regimes across domestic and international jurisdictions.  On this last step, financial regulators must address how to prevent 'death from a thousand cuts' by numerous state, federal and foreign regulators for FinTech firms that look to provide services across financial market regulatory jurisdictions.  Because emerging technology, such as DLT, has the potential to provide many benefits that transcend regulatory boundaries, financial regulators must start by putting forth uniform principles in order to avoid stifling innovation.  The CFTC and other US financial regulators are falling behind foreign jurisdictions in promoting FinTech.  The FCA, for example, has created a flourishing Innovation Hub that allows FinTech firms to introduce innovative financial products and services to the market and test new ideas through its Regulatory Sandbox.  Several other jurisdictions are now following the FCA’s lead.  The end of the year is generally a time to reflect on where we have been and where we would like to go in the year ahead.  The changing administration in the US provides an opportunity to take a fresh look at promoting DLT and FinTech innovation.  The five steps I have laid out provide a good roadmap. Further, I pledge to do my part in the new year to further DLT and FinTech innovation for the health and betterment of US financial and capital markets, market participants and the American jobs that they support.

42379072,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7muOL,1481596556,Bitcoin is Now Trading at its Highest Price Since 2014,"The price of bitcoin hit two major milestones today, reaching a new 2016 high and rising to its most elevated level since February 2014.  At press time, bitcoin's price rose to a high of $788.49, CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) figures reveal, the highest price observed in 34 months.  The figure not only surpassed the previous 2016 high of $781.31, but also represented bitcoin’s most elevated value since this summer, when expectations were high about the digital currency's upcoming decline in rewards.  However, with today's movements, bitcoin has finally broken through after weeks of flirting with its previous annual high. The digital currency neared $781 several times this month, but up until now, has been unable to surpass it.  Bitcoin prices came within roughly $2 of this previous high yesterday, and then broke through it at 01:45 UTC today, BPI figures reveal. After surpassing this level, the digital currency generated additional gains.  Now that bitcoin prices has surpassed the previous high of $781.31, this price could become a new support level for the digital currency.  Whether this support materializes or not, bitcoin prices have generated very strong returns so far this year, rising more than 80% from roughly $430 to more than $780.
