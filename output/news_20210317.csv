42433976,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP6r7h,1616024700,How China’s Digital Yuan Could Go Global,"China aims to be a global blockchain superpower, and its national digital currency is part of that plan. But if China really wants to achieve its global ambitions it will need help from other countries.      To that end, China has been quietly testing pilot digital currency trading platforms in different nations as well as setting up a legal framework for CBDCs with global financial regulators.      “You have central bank digital currencies (CBDC) developed on various platforms such as enterprise blockchain Corda or Hyperledger, and the digital yuan is technically not even on a blockchain,” Michael Sung, co-director of the Fintech Research Center at Fudan University, said. “That is a very balkanized ecosystem.”      For the digital yuan to achieve global adoption, China would thus need to work with trading partners or regional financial hubs to have a platform where the digital yuan is technically, legally and financially interoperable with other countries’ digital currencies.      One such platform is Inthanon-LionRock (Note), which is a central bank digital currency project for cross-border payments initiated by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Bank of Thailand (BOT).      Eight Thai banks and two Hong Kong banks, including HSBC, participated in the Note project and tested the feasibility of digital currency-based transactions between Thailand and Hong Kong, according to its white paper.      According to a Feb. 23 statement by HKMA, the digital currency arm of People’s Bank of China and the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have joined the second phase of this project and it has been renamed as the Multiple Central Bank Digital Currency (m-CBDC) Bridge.      The project aims to help central banks with cross-border fund transfers, international trade settlement and capital market transactions. The idea is to alleviate regulatory, cost and inefficiency pain points in cross-border fund transfers, the statement said.      “The Note project is very emblematic of China’s approach to internationalize the digital yuan,” Tavni Ratna, CEO and founder of blockchain and digital currency think tank Policy 4.0, said. “China might want to negotiate with one central bank at a time and come up with a mechanism for everything ranging from a legal framework to exchange rate between the two currencies.”    The wholesale shift    Two elements have set the project apart from other digital yuan projects in China so far. While such projects are usually only between two countries through a bilateral collaboration, the Bridge appears to have a third country – the UAE – involved in the CBDC trading platform, Ratna said.      The other element is the project is wholesale-oriented, which is a shift from China’s focus on retail use cases. The project will continue to explore other potential business cases such as cross-border funds transfers between institutions such as companies, banks rather than individual users, according to the white paper. In October 2020, the Hong Kong Treasury Secretary Christopher Hui also said the city is interested in these transactions.      The project will act as a cross-border corridor network for big financial institutions. It would entice more central banks to join the network by offering a more competitive foreign exchange rate than the open market, where each country has to buy other local currencies from intermediaries at a premium. It would also allow countries to borrow more other currencies in the short term to increase their liquidity to settle transactions in real time.      Read More: Geopolitics at Stake in US Response to China’s Digital Yuan: Report      Indonesia and China also signed a memorandum of understanding to promote local currencies in the two countries in September 2020. The partnership would allow the direct exchange rate quotations and interbank trading between the Chinese yuan and the Indonesian rupiah.This process, which could enable real-time transactions and avoid using the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency to settle and clear transactions, is crucial for a CBDC-trading platform to work.      As of January, China is Indonesia’s biggest trade partner and an important source of investment. The largest economy in Southeast Asia, like many other major countries in the region, has seen a fast growing deficit to China in recent years.    The hub    Some countries might be reluctant to trade central bank digital currencies on a platform designed by China due to privacy concerns, said Paul Triolo, head of the geo-technology practice at risk consultancy Eurasia Group.      To that end, China’s central bank could also join an inclusive digital currency platform, where it can trade the digital yuan with other digital currencies freely. As the largest offshore center for RMB deposits, Singapore’s blockchain project Ubin would be one possibility.      The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has worked with JPMorgan and state-backed conglomerate Tamasek to use CBDCs and other digital currencies, including the tokenized dollar JPM coin, on the Ubin platform. Founded in 2016 by MAS, ConsenSys and JPMorgan’s Quorum, which was acquired by ConsenSys in August 2020, the Ubin project aims to settle inter-bank transactions, cross-border remittances and tokenized securities through distributed ledger technology.      In contrast to a platform that is controlled by China, a more neutral and inclusive platform by MAS could be more acceptable for many other countries.      The Ubin project envisions having a common messaging platform to coordinate different settlement systems and establishing a common messaging standard to ease communications between the systems, according to the report, which cites the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) as an example for such coordination.      Read More: Beijing, Shanghai to Join Wider Testing of Digital Yuan in 2021      In June 2020, Ravi Menon, the managing director of MAS, said Singapore welcomes collaboration with China’s central bank on digital currency in a speech about financial cooperation between Singapore and Shanghai.      “With Temasek and JPMorgan in the project, the whole point was this financial hub pushing for more efficient and less-costly cross-border settlements,” Sung said. “While Hong Kong is obviously the place for China to start internationalizing the digital rmb, Singapore is a nice cross-border settlement point.”    Team player    The world has shown wariness of overly ambitious digital currencies. Given the political pressure on the Facebook-led diem (formerly libra) project, Beijing might have a hard time positioning China’s digital yuan as the national digital currency to dominate the global financial system, Triolo said.      Perhaps learning from this, China has tried to be more proactive and collaborative in setting an international legal framework for CBDCs. Chinese President Xi Jinping said the country should proactively participate in creating the international regulatory framework on digital currency and digital tax, according to an Oct. 31 essay he published in Chinese state media.      HKMA also emphasized the m-CBDC project has been supported by the Bank for International Settlements Innovation Hub Centre in Hong Kong. PBOC subsidiaries, including its digital currency unit, have set up the second joint venture with SWIFT in Beijing in February but the new group’s mission remains unclear.      China’s motivations for internationalizing the digital yuan rang from curbing Chinese fintech giants, weakening SWIFT to countering the U.S. dollar dominance over the global financial system, Ratna said.      “But one thing is for sure, China does not want to antagonize anyone along the way,” she said.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,David Pan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/03/17/how-chinas-digital-yuan-could-go-global,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b19b17d68f3f527e244c5c133f15c6d8c748aed2-1500x880.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Austria-based pool – which comprises some 20% of the Ethereum network’s hash power – became the first majority pool to introduce a Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) software strategy to compensate the “upcoming mining reward reduction caused by the adoption of EIP 1559,” according to a tweet Wednesday. MEV automates transaction sequencing in blockchains based on possible arbitrage opportunities, which Ethermine expects to increase mining rewards between 1%-10%. Ethermine plans to distribute 80% of MEV profits to the pool.  That EIP is slated for inclusion in the Ethereum network in July with the London hard fork. The proposal burns network transaction fees instead of giving them to miners, who process transactions. Miners are not very pleased with the proposal – even going as far as to threaten a 51% attack against Ethereum – but have few options on the table given Ethereum’s governance structure. So, many mining pools are adding MEV to supplement lost income, such as Flexpool.  In Ethereum, MEV is a general term relating to numerous strategies for front running or back running transactions in order to secure an arbitrage profit. The strategy has garnered wide attention in the trading community over the past year as decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols rose in popularity. Indeed, MEV research group Flashbots shows some $1.7 million in MEV-based profits were made in the last 24 hours alone.  Developers and miners alike have begun turning to MEV as a way to supplement miners who are certain to face steep revenue declines with fee burnings.

Climbing 3.68% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $54,201.70-$58,078.51 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC trades above its 10-hour and 50-hour averages on the hourly chart, a bullish signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin’s price flipped to green after Federal Reserve officials on Wednesday reaffirmed their expectations to keep interest rates close to zero at least through 2023, potentially bolstering the cryptocurrency’s appeal as a hedge against faster inflation.      As of press time, bitcoin was changing hands around $58,000, up from about $55,500 just before the Fed announced its decision around 18:00 coordinated universal time (2 p.m. ET).      The price has doubled this year, partly because of demand from institutional investors who are looking for an asset that might hold its worth if the dollar’s purchasing power declines. Central banks around the world have pumped trillions of dollars of freshly created money into global financial markets to stimulate their coronavirus-wrecked economies.      Wall Street firm Morgan Stanley’s wealth management unit on Wednesday published a research report arguing the “threshold is being reached” for cryptocurrency to become an investable asset class. On the same day, Morgan Stanley said it will offer its clients exposure to three bitcoin funds, while Hong Kong-listed software firm Meitu made additional investments in bitcoin and ether.      “This is a bullish step to further awareness and acceptance of bitcoin, and shows the organic underlying demand as investors look to seek alternatives to existing investment classes,” said Jason Lau, chief operating officer at San Francisco-based crypto exchange OKCoin.

At the same time, the number of BTC locked in the Ethereum blockchain saw a sharp rise on Wednesday after dropping for more than a month, according to data from DeFi Pulse.      “The hypergrowth that markets exhibited earlier in the year, especially with ether, appears on the surface to have subsided, but the reality could not be any different,” Denis Vinokourov, head of research at trading sentiment data provider Trade the Chain, said. “Specifically, the number of bitcoin locked on Ethereum continues to rise and much of this capital eventually lands across the DeFi ecosystem.”      A handful of lesser digital assets rose sharply Wednesday after Grayscale announced plans for new trusts linked to Chainlink’s LINK, Decentraland’s MANA and a handful of others. (Digital Currency Group is the parent of Grayscale and CoinDesk and an investor in Decentraland.)      Bitcoin’s temporary failure to move higher since Saturday’s all-time high may have also pushed some investors and traders to alternative cryptocurrencies.      “While this might be unexciting for bitcoin traders, it has ether traders licking their lips at the prospect of the leading altcoin regaining some market share,” Adam James, senior editor at OKEx Insights, said. “Likewise, traders will also be looking for altcoins and DeFi governance tokens to capitalize on a bitcoin consolidation.”      Read More: LINK, MANA Token Prices Spike as Grayscale Unveils New Trusts    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mostly in green Wednesday.

42433969,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP6qvh,1616007600,"For the Daring but Lazy, a New DeFi Product Simplifies Leveraged ETH Bets","The first thing to understand about leveraged investing is this: It loses money faster.      It also makes money faster. That's the second thing to understand.      A new decentralized finance (DeFi) product should drive this point home, for better or for worse. The brainchild of Index Coop, which aims to do for DeFi what S&P and Dow Jones did for stocks, it allows an investor to easily take a leveraged position on ether (ETH) with just one transaction.      The cooperative is releasing its first product using its Flexible Leverage Index (FLI), a token called ETH2x-FLI. It will target a value that goes up twice as fast as the second-largest cryptocurrency (and down the same way).      Leverage has been a killer use case for decentralized finance, starting all the way back with the money market Compound. But rarely has making such big bets required so little work.      ""There really isn't anything like this in terms of getting DeFi leverage in a single token,"" an Index Coop member who goes by the handle Lemonade Alpha told CoinDesk in a phone call.      The ETH price has climbed from $400 in late November to touching $2,000 in recent days. For users who believe it has further to go, FLI would be a way to double down on such gains.    Blockchain accelerant    Previously, to go extra long on ETH, a user would have to do the following: Deposit a bunch of ETH into Compound. Borrow a bunch of USDC, a stablecoin engineered to hold its value to the U.S. dollar, and swap all that for more ETH.      To go even further, he could deposit the fresh ETH and do the same loop again. We saw lots of that during the wildest parts of 2020’s “DeFi summer.”      Not only does that take much manual effort and require lots of transactions, it also puts the user in the position of stewarding the loan to make sure it doesn't fall below collateral requirements (if it needs more, that's more transactions).      With ETH2x-FLI, a user can get roughly the same exposure with a single transaction, said Lemonade. The leveraged position is simply tokenized and traded like any other ERC-20 token running on top of the Ethereum blockchain.      As a result, an investor's downside risk is easy to quantify: He can't lose more than the price he bought at – but he can lose it faster.      ""A lot of people, when they think about leverage, they think about this BitMEX kind of casino, 25 times margin position,"" Lemonade said. ""We think about this as completely opposite.""      ETH2x-FLI targets two times leverage, which means the holder should get twice the gains when ETH goes up and twice the losses when it goes down, but not always.      ""Sometimes the leverage itself is going to be [diminished] because the token is trying to be a safeguard for you,"" Lemonade said.    Safeguards    With FLI, robots have your back.      On the back end, ETH2x-FLI has done all the same transactions laid out in the examples above, which means there’s a bunch of collateral backing a bunch of loans. If the loans become undercollateralized the collateral gets slashed, and that hurts all holders of ETH2x-FLI. So it bears repeating that 2X is a target.      FLI uses an algorithm to protect the collateral. When necessary, the algorithm will increase its collateral position, which will decrease the leverage. By leaving flexibility around the amount of leverage, FLI can manage risk.      It's very expensive in DeFi for a loan to fall below its collateral requirement, which can happen quickly when a collateral asset is volatile (like ETH). When that happens, the collateral will be sold off to close the loan. The borrower will get his collateral returned but only after a hefty liquidation fee has been taken out.      Obviously if this happened to FLI it would hit a lot of users, which is why it's built for flexibility in terms of its collateralization buffer.      Though liquidations won't be able to hit too many users at first. FLI is intended to put a limit on its assets under management initially to $5 million. As the system proves to be safe, it can raise the cap.      Buying ETH2x-FLI on the open market won't be the only way to get it. Users can mint it directly, but that's probably going to be more appropriate for advanced users with deeper pockets. It works best when there's a dislocation between the market price of the token and the price Index at which Coop will mint, Lemonade Alpha explained.    More to come    Index Coop won't stop with ETH, but it expects this product to be its flagship leveraged offering.      ""The FLI is a general index structure. It can be adapted for other tokens outside of ETH,"" Lemonade Alpha explained.      There's no immediate plans around which ones or when. INDEX token holders will decide what else to make and when.Index Coop previously created the DeFi Pulse Index (DPI), which uses the Set Protocol under the hood just as FLI does. DPI packages together the top governance tokens in DeFi into one token.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/03/17/for-the-daring-but-lazy-a-new-defi-product-simplifies-leveraged-eth-bets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/faccf4108cfba6995cc5f82f035ede788de73802-1200x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin prices pared earlier losses as Fed Chair Jerome Powell said during a televised press conference that the U.S. central bank expects to keep monetary policy loose ""for as long as it takes"" to heal the coronavirus-wounded economy. The largest cryptocurrency is seen by many investors as a hedge against inflation, and a dovish monetary policy stance could allow faster price increases.      Prices for bitcoin rose to about $56,500 after the meeting, from about $55,500 just prior to the 18:00 UTC (2 p.m. ET) release.      The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the U.S. central bank's monetary policy panel, will keep the target rate for federal funds in a range of 0% to 0.25%, according to a statement released after a two-day meeting. The Fed plans to keep buying $80 billion of U.S. Treasury bonds and $40 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities every month.      U.S. stocks rose after the report.      According to the summary of economic projections:    Federal officials’ median expectation for growth this year in gross domestic product jumped to 6.5% from 4.2% in December, when they last disclosed projections.

The T3i BitVol Index from T3 Index, a financial indexing firm, measures the 30-day implied volatility of bitcoin.      The index offers cryptocurrency investors the ability to “trade volatility as a distinct asset class,” said Simon Ho, CEO of T3 Index.    The BitVol index has settled around an annualized 100% after reaching a high near 170% on January 15, which preceded a roughly 20% price correction in bitcoin.  Elevated volatility could be a signal of investor fear or uncertainty, while low levels of volatility signal investor complacency.  The first options trade off the BitVol Index was initiated on March 10, consisting of a March expiry 1-by-2 call spread that was bought for zero cost, Bloomberg reported.    The BitVol Index uses strike prices from tradable bitcoin options across various exchanges, a similar methodology applied by the Chicago Board of Trade’s (CBOE) VIX Index, which investors use to track volatility in the stock market.

42433983,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP6rFh,1615999367,"CryptoQuant Makes Changes After Misfired ‘Whale’ Alert, Bitcoin Sell-Off","Traders and analysts in digital asset markets are getting better all the time at learning how to monitor activity on the Bitcoin blockchain, scouring the network for clues on where the largest cryptocurrency’s price might head next.      But a recent alert sent by the South Korean blockchain analysis firm CryptoQuant involving an apparent transfer of $1.1 billion in bitcoin on the Winklevoss twins’ New York-based Gemini exchange stirred up much confusion – and backlash on Twitter. That's why the company’s chief said today he is changing procedures to avoid future snafus.      It's a reminder of just how powerful a role these blockchain data alerts play in cryptocurrency markets, and what can happen when they are what can happen when they’re mislabeled or interpreted incorrectly. It also highlights the power struggle between the retail-investing masses and a smaller number of deep-pocketed institutional players.      Read more: Bitcoin Transfers Worth Billions Could Mean More Selling Pressure      Bitcoin prices tumbled after the CryptoQuant alert on March 14, and some traders accused the firm of sending a false alarm filled with panic-inducing “FUD,” or fear, uncertainty and doubt.      “I think it’s dumb, but we had to” change the labeling on the alerts, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. “Some people think we manipulate the market by making FUD.”    'Whale' harpoon boomerangs    The latest kerfuffle started on Sunday, March 14, when CryptoQuant’s free Telegram-based service “CryptoQuant Alerts [Beta]” blasted out a message about the big bitcoin transfer:      “18,961 #BTC ($1,145,210,023) aggregated inflow to #Gemini: be careful downside risk from whale dumping,” the message read. A “whale,” in the jargon of crypto markets as well as on Wall Street, refers to a large investor whose buying or in this case selling might make big waves in the market.      As a result of this message, bitcoin prices dropped like an anchor as traders tried to get out of the leviathan’s way.      “Inflows up, price down,” as the digital-asset exchange firm EQUOS summarized the episode Tuesday in a note to clients.      Some angry traders and rival blockchain analysis firms called CryptoQuant’s alert off-base and especially galling after a similar episode that took place in late February.      The German analysis firm Glassnode tweeted March 15 that the inflow was an “internal” transfer on Gemini, meaning the funds were moved between wallets on the exchange, as opposed to moving onto the exchange from a wallet somewhere else. An internal transfer might represent a harmless administrative maneuver, not a lurking whale.      “Markets selling off due to ‘bogus’ data saying $1 billion of BTC flowing into Gemini,” bitcoin analyst Willy Woo tweeted March 15. “It's the second time it's happened in the last 30 days.”      Woo posted a chart showing how prices started falling after CryptoQuant’s alerts on March 14 and Feb. 21.      Two red dots on the chart signaled when CryptoQuant’s alerts were fired off, and they do appear to coincide with market tops. Leverage positions started getting liquidated as traders sold off.      During February’s sell-off, more than $2 billion worth of long traders were liquidated, while another about $1.6 billion long liquidation were triggered by this week’s correction.      Read More: Bitcoin Eyes Bull Revival as Dip Below $54K Wipes Out Millions More in Leverage      CryptoQuant “was very careless in their quality assurance over their data and alert service,” Woo told CoinDesk in a direct message on Twitter. “I wasn't even on their service and it was forwarded everywhere beyond the 28,300 traders who that group viewed.”      As of March 16, CryptoQuant’s March 14 alert on Telegram had been viewed more than 48,000 times.    Ju later acknowledged in a public post on Twitter the transfer probably wasn’t a bitcoin dump by a large holder. Instead, he wrote, the inflow appeared to come from a wallet belonging to the crypto lending platform BlockFi, which uses Gemini’s crypto custody servicehttps://help.blockfi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360048862572-How-does-BlockFi-custody-assets-What-are-the-risks-with-depositing-my-crypto-at-BlockFi-. Several other blockchain data analysts from companies including Chainalysis and Coin Metrics agreed with that conclusion.    “The wallet activity is part of our day-to-day operations for clients,” BlockFi’s director of business development, Rishi Ramchandani, told CoinDesk. “BlockFi is actively buying bitcoin, not selling.”      Gemini is BlockFi’s primary custodian, Ramchandani said, adding, “Seems like some people on Twitter are confused about this.”      On Wednesday, CryptoQuant Alerts Telegram group put out an update: “We removed words talking about possibilities in our public alert. It will only deliver facts. For the 'dumping' and 'pumping' possibilities based on our analysis, we'll include those in our preset alerts for paid users. It will launch shortly.”      Ju insists that implications weren’t so clear-cut: Though some of the messaging got twisted, the bitcoin transfer still might have provided an early warning of potential selling.      “It's a fact that BlockFi uses Gemini Custody, but Gemini provides instant trading services for institutions [that] use Gemini Custody,” Ju said in a Telegram message with CoinDesk. “Whales using Gemini Custody can dump bitcoin instantly without making any on-chain transactions.”      “Most whales are using Custody services, so it's hard to figure out dumping risks for retail investors if we don't alert this kind of data,” he added.      In other words, the blockchain data alert was spot-on, even if the interpretation might have been off.      Ju sent CoinDesk a screenshot of an email exchange with a Gemini customer support representative, confirming the addresses responsible for the bitcoin inflows didn’t belong to Gemini.    Retail vs. institutions    While the episode highlights the crucial of role of blockchain data in cryptocurrency price predictions, it also points to a theme that keeps coming up throughout markets from digital assets to Wall Street: the never-ending power struggle between the retail-investing masses and a smaller number of deep-pocketed institutional players who often seem to have an unfair advantage.      Retail investors, who might be more susceptible to rash emotional decisions during market downturns, often view themselves as having less power and information while institutions appear to possess more sophisticated trading strategies, with better market access and privileged knowledge.      That’s partly why blockchain data is so valuable. Ideally, the extra information and the alerts enhance market transparency, ostensibly leveling the playing field.      While many may find it hard to read or analyze the blockchain data, the theory is that messaging services like CryptoQuant's should help retail traders avoid outsize losses.      “When the people miss the boat they just miss it,” Twitter user @AncientMedicin3 wrote in a response to Glassnode’s statement. “When institutions miss the boat they bring it back! Read: intentional manipulation for the big boys to buy back in at a lower price.”      Other commenters had a more cynical take.      “All this data now just is abused anyway,” Twitter user @Dynamic_One_ wrote. “No need to even sell yourself, just move a few things around and people panic and sell. Bogus data or not, all it now takes is moving from people wanting to manipulate and all the people watching things like Glassnode suddenly sell. Or am I wrong?”",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/03/17/cryptoquant-makes-changes-after-misfired-whale-alert-bitcoin-sell-off,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/63061ee66ec2c2bc39e7e4fd559c2fc1146f80fb-1500x996.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42433972,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP6qzh,1615999274,The Node: Bitcoin Is 'Digital Gold' Because People Say It Is,"In early March, the mobile software firm Meitu made headlines as the first public company to put ether (ETH) on its balance sheet along with bitcoin (BTC). Today, it announced another allocation to those two cryptocurrencies.      In its initial announcement, the firm said blockchain could disrupt finance and technology, like “mobile internet has disrupted the PC internet.” It holds a particularly high opinion of Ethereum and could imagine investing in projects or protocols, or even developing Ethereum-based applications. But it’s Meitu’s reasons for investing in bitcoin that actually bear examination.      One of several publicly traded companies to put bitcoin on its balance sheet over the past several months, Meitu thinks of the cryptocurrency as an “alternative store of value.” Amid “aggressive increases in money supply by central banks globally,” bitcoin has a chance of holding its value, a Board statement says.      But the consensus opinion around bitcoin is more important to Meitu than its fundamentals. Despite cryptographic features including limited supply, portability and fungibility, “[bitcoin’s] price is primarily a function of future demand that is driven by consensus of investors and the general public.” In other words, bitcoin excels as a store of value because that’s what other people say it is.      “Recently the Board has seen growing momentum in the consensus building process,” Meitu writes. It noticed “conservative institutions” such as insurance funds, asset managers and other publicly listed companies – like Tesla, unnamed – moving to accept bitcoin payments as well as adding it to their treasuries.      It’s common to describe bitcoin as digital gold, though as Meitu’s announcement shows, that may be little more than a meme. Bitcoin maintains its value because more and more people believe it will. As Bloomberg’s Tracy Alloway once argued, bitcoin is whatever you want it to be, making it “really the perfect post-modern financial asset.”      Last week, CoinDesk’s director of data and indexes, Galen Moore, wrote that bitcoin is less like digital gold, as it’s often described, than a $100 bill. Bitcoin, designed for online commerce, is a rarely used “bearer instrument” as well as a store of value. “[B]itcoin isn’t valuable necessarily because it is spent, but because it could be spent.” Presumably, there will be a counterparty on the other side of that transaction.      Does it matter why Meitu is investing in bitcoin exactly? Not really. It's all the same to BTC, which carries on regardless, whatever people think of it. But the statement does point to the meta-nature of modern investing, where memes mean as much as revenue and bottom lines.

42433975,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP6r5h,1615995690,When DeFi Becomes Intelligent,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) has been capturing the minds and hearts of the crypto community in the last few months. DeFi offers a new and transparent playground to automate financial primitives such as lending or market making without the need of intermediaries.      The on-chain centric nature of DeFi protocols generates a data footprint unprecedented in capital market vehicles. This data can be used by machine intelligence models to better understand and benefit from the behavior of DeFi protocols.    Jesus Rodriguez is the CEO of IntoTheBlock, a market intelligence platform for crypto assets. He has held leadership roles at major technology companies and hedge funds. He is an active investor, speaker, author and guest lecturer at Columbia University in New York.    Currently, this level of DeFi intelligence is used mostly as part of third-party applications such as arbitrage bots or yield generating strategies. As DeFi evolves, intelligence should move from a third-party application to a core capability of DeFi protocols.      In simpler terms, while the current generation of DeFi protocols has brought us unprecedented levels of programmability and automation, the next wave will focus on intelligence as a core capability. We are on the verge of the intelligent DeFi era.      See also: Jesus Rodriguez - Five Machine Learning Methods Crypto Traders Should Know About      Software is eating the world and artificial intelligence (AI) is eating software. Most of the world’s software is being rewritten, with AI as a first-class citizen. Just like databases or APIs, AI is becoming a fundamental building block of modern software applications. Business and consumer applications across diverse domains are becoming intelligent in nature and so is the infrastructure powering them. DeFi is likely to undergo a similar transformation.      The cornerstone of the first generation of successful DeFi protocols has been the automation of financial primitives such as lending or market-making in the form of programmable interfaces. That level of programmability and automation has started to push the boundaries of innovation creating vehicles such as flash loans, automated market-makers (AMM) or on-chain insurance that are impossible to even imagine in other capital markets.    The combination of these two movements seems inevitable and can unlock a new level of innovation in DeFi.    The focus of this generation of DeFi protocols has been on programmability, but the next generation should look towards intelligence. There is something beautiful, almost seductive, about the simplicity of the x*y=k balance in UniSwap or the liquidation logic in Compound. But the evolution of the market is likely to push us towards more sophisticated DeFi protocols that leverage machine intelligence as a first-class citizen. These types of protocols won’t only enable robust levels of automation, but they will be able to learn and evolve their behavior based on market activity.      What does DeFi intelligence really mean? In plain terms, imagine a group of DeFi primitives that intelligently evolve their behavior based on data about the historical performance or conditions of the crypto market. These intelligent DeFi primitives would not only bring new levels of efficiency to that market but they can also be combined to enable a new generation of smart, decentralized asset management vehicles.      See also: Jesus Rodriguez - 10 Reasons Quant Strategies for Crypto Fail      Let’s explore a few ambitious ideas in this area.    Intelligent AMM    As its name indicates, the current generation of AMMs such as UniSwap, Balancer or PancakeSwap are focused on automation. On top of AMMs, traders have built all sorts of smart strategies ranging from questionable front-running mechanisms to incredibly clever arbitrages. What if that intelligence could be incorporated as part of the underlying AMMs?      Let’s imagine a new generation of AMMs that adjust the balances based on oracles that use predictive models to forecast the relationship between different assets. This type of intelligent AMM will learn from factors such as historical market performances of the behavior in a given set of liquidity pools to determine an asset distribution function that correctly reflects the current market conditions. Among its many benefits, intelligent AMMs can help reduce the excessive levels of arbitrage that we are experiencing in the current generation of AMMs.    Intelligent DeFi lending    Lending in DeFi protocols is another area that is likely to incorporate intelligence capabilities as a first-class building block. Products like flash loans have already proven the possibilities of DeFi to enable lending models that are not possible in traditional market vehicles. The current generation of lending protocols such as Maker, Aave or Compound are, for the most part, based on collateralization models and still ignore many other factors that can enable robust borrower-lender dynamics.      As the DeFi lending evolves, we should expect the intelligence of lending protocols to evolve with it. We could easily envision DeFi lending protocols that would factor not only collateralization levels but factors such as liquidation history, interactions with other lending protocols and transactional patterns to develop an intelligent and quantitative profile of borrowers and lenders. Think about this trend as an intelligent credit rating system for DeFi protocols.    Intelligent insurance    Insurance is becoming an established component of the DeFi ecosystem. Platforms such as Nexus Mutual are introducing a level of stability in DeFi by insuring smart contracts across different platforms. But current insurance models are based on the characteristics of specific DeFi platforms but, at the moment, leverage very little intelligence.      In a world in which the interactions with DeFi protocols are completely transparent, that data footprint can be used to create smarter insurance models. Let’s imagine a model in which the insurance of specific smart contracts or addresses is based on intelligent models that use quantitative DeFi factors such as the number of liquidations in lending protocols the smart contract has been exposed to or the types of pools specific addresses are supplying liquidity. These factors could provide a very intelligent profile about specific addresses that could be incorporated into decentralized insurance models.    DeFi intelligence is not optional    Willian Gibson’s famous quote “The future is already here – it’s just not very evenly distributed“ certainly applies to the role of intelligence in the next generation of DeFi protocols. At first, the idea of intelligent DeFi protocols might seem like one of those “AI for X” ideas (add your favorite term: recruiting, accounting, CRM, etc.) that attempts to insert AI into any meaningful software trend in the market. However, the reality of the fintech space in general and DeFi in particular paint a very different picture.      Intelligence is not a fancy requirement of a key component of the next phase of DeFi protocols. Functionally, DeFi is attempting to automate and dis-intermediate the core building blocks of financial services. At the same time, the rapid evolution of machine learning technologies is making these traditional services in capital markets become more intelligent.      See also: Ben Goertzel - Applying Blockchain and AI to Combat COVID      Think about the increasing levels of machine intelligence displayed by robo-advisors like Betterment, active managers like Two Sigma or even brokerage services like Interactive Brokers. Competing with that level of intelligence requires more than automation and programmability. It requires intelligence.      The frantic evolution of DeFi together with the mainstream adoption of machine learning technologies are forging the path towards intelligent DeFi protocols. This new generation of DeFi protocols won’t automate only financial primitives in a decentralized manner but will intelligently evolve their behavior based on market conditions and utilization.      DeFi is one of the most disruptive technology trends in modern fintech. Machine learning and AI technologies are becoming a key building block of any modern software system. The combination of these two movements seems inevitable and can unlock a new level of innovation in DeFi that powers a brand new generation of decentralized, trust-less, intelligent financial services.",POSITIVE,없음,BAL | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Jesus Rodriguez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/03/17/when-defi-becomes-intelligent,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bf9a4ccad94fead4b50eb3ed09e507551019e3e0-1400x1050.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433959,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP6jZh,1615994109,"LINK, MANA Token Prices Spike as Grayscale Unveils New Trusts","Prices for Chainlink’s LINK token and Decentraland's MANA shot up after the conglomerate Grayscale on disclosed plans Wednesday for new investment trusts linked to the digital assets.      Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein announced the trusts on Twitter at around 13:00 UTC (9 a.m. ET), and soon afterward LINK rose 7% to above $30. Grayscale is known for its bitcoin trust, ticker GBTC, which has become one of the most common ways for new investors to bet on the cryptocurrency's price, since the vehicle can be bought and sold in stock markets, somewhat like an exchange-traded fund. (Grayscale is a unit of Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk.)      MANA, the native token of virtual reality platform Decentraland, jumped nearly 20% to above $1. Grayscale also launched products dedicated to basic attention token (BAT), filecoin (FIL), and livepeer, powering gains in these lesser-known coins.      The new trusts could unlock the exotic digital tokens for a new breed of well-capitalized investors because Grayscale's trusts are seen as a way of gaining exposure to cryptocurrency prices without taking on the extra procedures and risks of owning them directly.      Chainlink provides price feeds to automated, blockchain-based lending and trading platforms built using blockchain technology, collectively known as decentralized finance, or DeFi. These data ""oracles"" are used by smart contracts – mini computer programs running atop blockchain networks, primarily Ethereum.      Price chart analysis, however, shows LINK has yet to cross above a descending trendline, a key hurdle for traders looking for predictive patterns.

We may soon see trusts for Aave, Cosmos, Polkadot, monero and Cardano if other filings are followed through.  “At any one time, we’re probably maintaining a list of what could be 30 products, could be 40 products that we’re interested in bringing to market,” Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein told Bloomberg.  The new trusts are the firm's first additions since 2019, and come after Grayscale assessed both potential demand and did due diligence on the underlying protocols, per the report.  While the five cryptocurrencies now supported for investment are not mainstream yet, Sonnenshein said many of Grayscale's trusts ""have historically been a little bit before their time.""

The woman, described as being 63 years old, said: ""Today there is no point keeping [money] in the bank – the interest rates are insulting […] That is why when I received my pension, I put a third of it into gold, a third of it into silver and the remainder into bitcoin…""      The ASA said the ad was, “socially irresponsible because it suggested that purchasing bitcoin was a good or secure way to invest one’s savings or pension.”      The regulator added the complainant who challenged the advertisement said the ad targeted retirees and was “misleading” because it didn't make clear the risks associated with investing in the cryptocurrency.      In a response to the complaint, Coinfloor said there had been a disclaimer in small print toward the bottom of the ad that stated, “Investing in cryptocurrencies involves significant risk and can result in the loss of your invested capital. You should not invest more than you can afford to lose”.      ""We considered the disclaimer was insufficient to counteract the overall message of the ad that buying bitcoin represented a secure investment, and given the font size and its positioning it had not been presented clearly or prominently enough to ensure consumers were made aware of the risk of loss of capital,"" said the ASA.

42433955,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP6jTh,1615982531,"Bitcoin Drops 3% Ahead of Fed Meeting, Despite Bullish Chart Pattern","Bitcoin is nursing losses ahead of a crucial Federal Reserve policy meeting that could reveal the U.S. central bank's plans in the wake of rising inflation expectations.      The top cryptocurrency, which is seen by many investors as a hedge against rising prices, was trading near $55,000 at press time, for a 3.3% drop on the day, based on CoinDesk 20 data. The decline upended any follow-through to Tuesday's impressive bounce from sub-$53,500 to nearly $57,000.      ""We expect the Fed to keep the borrowing costs at record lows and maintain quantitative easing,"" said Joel Kruger, currency strategist at LMAX Digital. ""The key focus will be on interest rate projections and whether or not an improved pandemic recovery outlook will translate to an earlier hike.""      With inflation expectations at a 13-year high and the economy showing signs of life, markets are pricing an early unwinding of stimulus in the form of interest rate hikes.      As per Reuters, eurodollar futures, which track short-term U.S. interest rate expectations, are now foreseeing a first rate hike by March 2023 versus late 2023 a few weeks ago. The U.S. 10-year bond yield recently rose to over 12-month highs above 1.6%.      ""If the Fed pushes back against market expectations and signals no rate hike until 2024, we think such an outcome would be supportive of bitcoin,"" Kruger said.      However, the cryptocurrency may face selling pressure if the central bank signals an early scaling back of stimulus, Kruger added. Investors typically buy inflation hedges when expecting rate cuts and vice versa.      Two-thirds of economists recently surveyed by Bloomberg expect policymakers to keep rates near zero through 2023. Besides, the market pricing of rate hikes has gone wrong in the past. While markets expected a rate increase in 12 to 18 months of the 2008 crash, the Fed delivered the first rate hike only in 2015, according to Reuters.      Aside from interest rate projections, the focus would be on Fed Chair Jerome Powell's take on the recent rise in bond yields and the central bank's decision on the supplementary leverage ratio (SLR), a capital-adequacy measure for banks. A looser SLR requirement theoretically allows banks to expand their balance sheets faster, which creates incremental risk but frees financing for loans to governments, businesses and households.      ""The market wants the SLR extended and reassurances regarding yields. If the SLR doesn't get extended and Powell plays rising yields down, turmoil in rates would ensue, pushing other markets down,"" trader Alex Kruger tweeted.      Bitcoin fell by 20% in the last week of February, after the U.S. bond market jitters came to the forefront with the sharp rise in the 10-year bond yield.      As per technical charts, Tuesday's low of $53,221 is now the level to defend for bitcoin bulls.      Bitcoin formed a ""hammer candle"" on Tuesday, signaling an end of the pullback from the record high above $61,000 and scope for another leg higher. It's called a hammer candle because of its shape on the price chart (see above), and the pattern looks bullish.      Also read: How the Federal Reserve Might Try to Calm Inflation Fears This Week      However, the bullish setup would be invalidated if Tuesday's low is breached.

42433958,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP6jbh,1615980600,Valid Points: Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake May Happen Sooner Than You Think,"Eth 2.0 may be coming to a computer screen near you quicker than most anticipated, including the Ethereum developers.      Last week, Vitalik Buterin released a “quick merge via fork choice change” document – a lighter version of the Executable Beacon Chain for quick deployment. While only a loose technical document, the plan ostensibly serves as a notice against any further agitation from Ethereum miners as the merge would allow Ethereum to abandon mining in a rapid fashion.      The Executable Beacon Chain is a proposal to attach Eth 1.x – which we will now refer to as Ethpow (proof-of-work Ethereum) – onto the currently running proof-of-stake Ethereum: the Beacon Chain.      The proposal works by having slightly altered Ethereum software, like Geth or OpenEthereum, point its transaction flow at the Beacon Chain. Instead of miners packaging transactions into blocks, the Beacon Chain’s validators will verify and finalize transactions.    Read more: Valid Points: CoinDesk’s Ethereum 2.0 Validator Is Officially Staked    “The only change required on the ethpow side is that the client must have a communication channel with a trusted beacon node and must change its fork choice rule,” Buterin writes.    Why the rush?    A quickened transition schedule is being considered for a few reasons. One recent consideration has been rising tensions between mining parties and Ethereum developers as EIP 1559 and PoS come into focus. The former proposal is highly contested by mining parties, but has achieved enough support among developers to be included in July’s London hard fork. PoS, of course, would see mining done away with completely.      Developers, however, have the high ground in this fight. A quick merge to PoS would only require “at least one honest miner” in order to start the merge. Multiple honest mining parties pointing blocks to the Beacon Chain would entail a smooth transition, Buterin says.      A quick transition to PoS does preclude the inclusion of multiple highly touted Ethereum tech stacks, at least for the moment.      Yet, at the end of the day a transition to PoS remains the goal of Ethereum developers, as it has been since before Ethpow launched. Any transition to PoS where Ethereum doesn't lose its top dog position as the go-to platform for decentralized apps would likely be considered a victory.    Pulse check: Validator efficiencies    If you’re new to Valid Points and the topic of Ethereum 2.0 in general, be sure to check out our 101 explainer on Eth 2.0 metrics to get up to speed about terminology used throughout this newsletter.      CoinDesk’s Eth 2.0 validator node, Zelda, is humming along perfectly, earning roughly 0.0073 ETH or $13.12 per day.      While the amount of reward earned by our Eth 2.0 validator has not changed significantly over the past few weeks, I did notice a spike in Zelda’s computer processing power and a subsequent drop in her memory usage.      According to CoinDesk’s data dashboard, Zelda’s central processing unit (CPU) usage almost doubled from around 100% to 200% on Friday, March 12, and has stayed at these heightened levels ever since.      This suggests that Zelda is consuming more electrical energy in order to perform the same tasks it did before. For context, Zelda has four CPUs it can max out before validator operations are negatively impacted. Operating at a level of 200% suggests we’re using the max computing power of two out of four CPUs.      At the same time, Zelda’s usage of random access memory (RAM), which is the component of a computer that is reserved for temporary data storage, has gone down from around 4 GB to rough 2.5 GB.      This suggests the memory capacity needed for running this Eth 2.0 validator has dropped. Zelda has up to 16GB of RAM, enough for an average desktop computer to run various applications and demanding games. For Eth 2.0 validating, we use roughly 15% of total RAM, enough for tablet devices to use.    Ethereum validator rewards vs. mining rewards    It’s important to note that under a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus protocol, whereby transactions and blocks are finalized through the process of mining, the aim would be to consistently max out a computer’s processing power and optimize all unused components of hardware for increasing the probability of earning network rewards.      Under Ethereum’s proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus protocol, there’s no need to do either of these things. Despite operating below its computational capacity, Zelda still maintains an effectiveness of 100%, according to beaconcha.in. This is because, unlike mining, staking isn’t about competing for rewards against other validators through greater hashpower.      All validators who keep their operations up and running are rewarded on a consistent and regular basis in the form of interest on their stake. The only way to substantially increase the amount of rewards earned on the network is to stake more wealth in 32 ETH increments. (More on the reward dynamics of Eth 2.0 validators versus Ethereum miners here.)      The Eth 2.0 network does not reward aggressive increases in computing power nor sneaky optimizations to hardware. If anything, developers of the protocol are working hard to find ways in which the computational burden of being a validator can be reduced even further and updated so that even a mobile device could one day be sufficient for securing the network.      Going back to the mysterious changes in CPU usage and RAM, it turns out a code update was released by CoinDesk Director of Engineering Spencer Beggs last Friday in preparation for Ethereum’s upcoming system-wide upgrade dubbed “Berlin.”      As an Eth 2.0 validator, Zelda’s responsibilities can only be performed by connecting to both Ethereum’s PoW and PoS networks. The upcoming upgrade to Ethereum’s PoW network required Beggs to update part of our software, which likely triggered these changes in our energy consumption and memory usage.      This code update is mandatory for all Eth 2.0 validators and must be implemented by April 14, 2021, at the latest. If you’re a validator and haven’t yet made the upgrade, you can download and install the latest software releases for Berlin here.

42433945,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP6j9h,1615976274,NFTs Can Bring the Real World On-Chain,"Non-fungible tokens (NFT) have generated an unprecedented level of mainstream interest in cryptocurrency technology. Believers claim NFTs represent a “paradigm shift” whereas detractors compare NFTs to the “Tulip Mania” and the initial coin offering era.      We have seen similar polarization of public opinion before with blockchain technology and dot-com stocks, which resulted in several breakthrough innovations and some epic commercial failures.    Ajit Tripathi, a CoinDesk columnist, is the head of Institutional Business at Aave. Previously, he served as a fintech partner at ConsenSys and was a co-founder of PwC’s U.K. Blockchain Practice. The views expressed are those of the author alone.    In this article, I will explain why I believe NFTs in the form of digital art, music and collectibles represent only the beginning of a much larger wave of real-economy “e-commerce” transactions on public blockchains.    What are NFTs?    While for a purist, “NFT” stands for any non-fungible token, in popular parlance today NFT is used in the sense of a “digital collectible.” The New York Times recently described NFTs in somewhat irreverent terms as “blockchain-certified computer files.” In a previous article, the Times wrote, “Most importantly, NFTs make digital artworks unique, and therefore sellable.”      See also: What Are NFTs and How Do They Work?      Influencers such as Gary Vaynerchuk, Marc Cuban and Chamath Palihapitya have expressed their enthusiasm for NFTs, triggering a large amount of investment in NFT issuance and trading platforms such as NBA Top Shot and Sorare. This has been followed by a sudden burst of of products coming to market in a bit of a gold rush.      For the purposes of this article, we will stick to NFTs as digital collectibles that people love to own, pay for and brag to their friends and strangers about.    NFTs are valuable objects    If I am part of a community that assigns a value to a digital object, that value is the value of the object. This is why Pokemon cards and baseball cards are valuable, why bitcoin and ether are valuable and why NFTs such as Aavegotchis, NBA Top Shot, Non-Fungible Pepes and NFTs minted by Beeple are valuable. There is a community of humans that finds the objects valuable and largely agrees on their value.      See also: Vinay Gupta’s Big Idea: An Identity Layer for Your Things      In my last CoinDesk article, I wrote about the challenges involved in bringing off-chain assets to decentralized finance (DeFi). As it turns out, most NFTs, though digital, are representations of off-chain assets. It’s not surprising, then, that many of the challenges associated with off-chain assets are directly or indirectly relevant to NFTs as well.      Essentially, an NFT “binds” or maps a unique object, the blockchain native non-fungible token to a digital object, e.g., a document, image, audio or video file or a physical object such as a house or a bicycle or your own private Island.      That is the crux of the issue. Most NFTs are not crypto-native assets. Unlike bitcoin, a non-fungible asset that lives its entire lifecycle on the Bitcoin blockchain, a digital work of art such as Beeple’s $69 million painting, “The First 5000 Days” is not blockchain-native. This painting was created as a collage made of 5,000 different digital works of art in desktop software and then bound to a non-fungible token created by Beeple on the Ethereum blockchain. That means while the token, i.e., the bytes on Ethereum, are blockchain-native, the underlying work of art is not.    More valuable than a copy    The distinction between the token and the digital object to which it binds is quite crucial. In the crypto-native world, property rights and ownership are defined by “not your keys, not your crypto” – meaning that (absent certain circumstances) you control the private key that can send (assign) the token to someone else, you own the token (and all associated rights).      However, in case of a digital collectible, the ownership of a token may or may not mean you own the underlying computer file to which the token maps. Blockchains use a hash function to establish uniqueness but a JPEG file and its copy both produce the same hash.      See also: Ajit Tripathi - How to Bring Off-Chain Assets to DeFi      Content addressable systems (systems that allow information to be retrieved based on its content rather than location) such as IPFS (a decentralized network) can solve this problem by allowing an NFT to bind with an IPFS URL such that you own the resource but the copy of the JPEG is a different resource.      In this scenario, the URL bound to the token becomes worth $69 million whereas the URL corresponding to the copy is basically worth $0. Essentially it’s the token minted by Beeple that “makes” the artwork worth $69 million more than a copy of the digital artwork.    Double-spend scenarios    However, purely from a technical point of view, an artist or another actor can double-spend a digital object on (a) the same blockchain (b) on a different NFT platform (c) on a different blockchain.      Further, multiple non-fungible tokens can be mapped to the same underlying digital file or IPFS URL or to different copies of the same digital file. Indeed, on-chain ownership is not sufficient for off-chain objects unless the legal framework governing the rights of an NFT owner respects and enforces these rights in the off-chain world. I might own a Beeple artwork on Ethereum but Justin Sun might mint the Beeple artwork on the Tron blockchain and thus claim ownership of the artwork anyway. A court in the U.S. might enforce MetaKovan’s rights, whereas a court in Macau might decide in favor of Sun.    NFTs and contracts    So when you buy an NFT, what do you really get? The answer is, it depends. In one of my discussions with Vinay Gupta of Mattereum, he pointed out that in the case of NBA Top Shot, you own a “worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free license to use, copy and display the art for personal, non commercial use … or to purchase or sell on a marketplace that meets conditions specified … ” and so on, as described in the NBA Top Shot's Terms of Use.      That means in any of the above double-spend scenarios, what I own could depend on what an NFT marketplace will do to honor and enforce my rights.    NFTs as Ricardian contracts    It’s unclear what happens if a web-based platform used to buy and sell NFTs updates its terms of use. Does that update alter my rights as I understood them when I paid for the digital collectible? The answer is unclear. It’s possible that if the terms of use themselves are off-chain, such terms of use and therefore the rights they assign are not immutable.      Fortunately, in the blockchain world there’s already a design pattern called “Ricardian contracts'' that provides self-contained enforceable contracts implemented in source code. Ideally, NFTs should be implemented as Ricardian contracts that define the terms and governing law in the preamble and then use these definitions to impart rights and obligations in the source code that follows. In case of a dispute, courts can refer to the source code itself and not have to rely on the website terms of use and such.    The long-term value of NFTs    NFT platforms are doing three critical things.      First, by creating a large, digitally native market for off-chain assets using on-chain tokens, these platforms are providing a proof of value for bringing other off-chain assets such as land titles, cars, houses and bonds – basically everything of any value on to Web 3.0.      Second, by building robust, scalable infrastructure for minting, trading and settling NFTs on-chain, NFT platforms are bringing ordinary, nontechnical people to crypto platforms in the way nothing else has so far. I’d not be surprised if 100 million new people become comfortable with using wallets like Metamask and DeFi products this year and next year because they want to trade digital collectibles.      See also: Jeff Wilser - How NFTs Became Art, and Everything Became an NFT      Third, by sparking debates such as the one contained in this article, NFTs will force common and civil law frameworks to align off-chain rights with onchain rights. Before NFTs, this has not been the case. If degens lose their bitcoin or USDC, they lose it and courts and legislators aren’t particularly called upon.      On the other hand, if investors, asset managers, grandma and grandpa lose their Beeples or Top Shots to a double-spend, they will vote and these votes will force legislators to create laws that enforce their rights.      Essentially, with NFTs we are looking at technical consensus evolving into a market which in turn forces the social consensus. While I may personally prefer to own FLOW and ETH than Beeples and Top Shot moments, it’s the Beeples and Top Shot moments that have suddenly accelerated Web 3.0 like nothing that came before.      This is why I am so excited about NFTs.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Ajit Tripathi,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/03/17/nfts-can-bring-the-real-world-on-chain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/91d1bc5a788967b3aeef82594b4335579cf12a70-1400x837.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433967,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP6jVh,1615974295,What NFT Sales Mean for Digital Real Estate,"In New York City, there is a row of tall, skinny, high-rise condominium buildings along the southern end of Central Park that's become known as “Billionaire’s Row.” The average apartment there sells for more than $37 million, several have sold for more than $100 million, and one even sold for the staggering price of $240 million.      Although the buildings offer ultra-luxury finishes and spectacular views, a popular topic of local conversation is how nonsensical those prices seem. What is even more remarkable is that almost nobody lives inside these apartments; they mostly sit unused. People are flabbergasted that these vacant apartments trade for such high prices.    Janine Yorio is head of the real estate group at Republic and the Republic Realm fund, a digital real estate NFT fund.    As it turns out, humans are notoriously bad at pricing assets, especially when an asset’s value is exponentially higher than its actual utility. This explains why people are confused by the prices on Billionaire’s Row or are consistently astonished when art trades for large sums of money.      So last week, when Christie’s sold Beeple’s digital art for $69 million, naturally people were aghast. (Beeple is an artist who, until October, had never sold a piece of art for more than $100.)      Although people believe assets prices are related to their utility, in reality asset values are determined by two factors: collective belief and transferability.      For example, money only has value because people believe they will be able to easily exchange it for goods and services in the future. Like currency, art’s value is based upon society’s collective agreement about its value – and nothing more. The value of art has little to do with the cost of the materials used to make it or how useful it is, which is why most people cannot accurately price it.      See also: Janine Yorio - Here Comes the Virtual Real Estate Boom      Website domain names are another virtual asset, just a combination of letters that exist only online. Dozens of domain names have sold for more than $10 million apiece. (The most expensive domain name sale was for carinsurance.com, which sold for $49.7 million.) Yet, we have made peace with the fact that certain domain names trade for high prices because they are considered to be more “rare.”      So when a friend recently asked me, “Why would I pay real money for fake land?,” I explained that digital real estate is like a combination of NFT art and domain names. That’s because the marginal cost to produce a digital parcel of land is almost nothing, and its value is more closely related to its perceived scarcity than to its actual utility.      Recently, digital real estate prices have been appreciating more quickly than real-world real estate (just ask the artist Krista Kim, who sold an NFT of a house for $500,000). Some might even say the prices seem inflated. Meanwhile, some of the most trafficked streets in the world – including New York's Madison Avenue and Broadway and London's Oxford Street – are littered with empty storefronts, bringing about the so-called “retail apocalypse.” Landlords literally cannot give away this space, not even for free.    Collective belief in the value of virtual real estate is already growing.    Although stores sit empty, people are still buying things. In the never-ending search for customers, real-world companies have followed shoppers online. Their next stop is the metaverse, where their customers are socializing and window-shopping – and now even buying real-world items.      Although the number of users in metaverses is still just a trickle, when users do start populating metaverses in meaningful numbers, selling real-world products to people in those virtual worlds will become a very cost-effective way to market things. The convergence of real-world spending in virtual world environments is nothing new. Players have been buying “skins” and extra lives in video games for years. (Amazon is a fascinating case study in the increasingly intertwined relationship between e-commerce and brick and mortar retail.)      Big companies opening virtual stores in virtual worlds is a natural progression, and they are already starting to do so.      For example, Domino’s has made it so people can buy pizza from a store in the metaverse Decentraland and receive the pizza at their real-world address. (CoinDesk parent DCG is an investor in Decentraland.)      See also: Jeff Wilser - The People of Decentraland Will Greet You Now      Also, this past week, Adidas dropped a collaboration with Karlie Kloss inside Decentraland, where attendees could get a free (virtual) pair of Adidas shoes for their avatar to wear. This corporate-sponsored virtual event was attended by people from all over the world. Companies are realizing that virtual events like these can be much more cost-effective than real-world ones.      Imagine the possibilities if instead of Nike having a store on every Main Street in America it built one jaw-dropping virtual retail experience in a metaverse that could sell to quite literally anybody anywhere at any time? At some point, every company will realize it needs virtual stores in a metaverse like Decentraland, just as they have all learned they must all have a website on the internet.      The results are self-fulfilling. As the content inside the metaverses becomes more compelling, more people will show up, thus attracting more corporate sponsorships.      So does it make sense that “fake” land trades at prices that approach real-world valuations?      In 2014, Chanel purchased a nearly 4,000-square-foot retail space on Madison Avenue in New York City for $123.8 million. At $31,000 per square foot, this sale broke records, and people at the time felt the price made no sense.      But if a virtual storefront can cater to an infinite number of potential customers (millions more than walk down Madison Avenue in a year), then the value of virtual land may eventually trade at prices that seem as mystifying as Beeple’s art or condos on Billionaire’s Row. Collective belief in the value of virtual real estate is already growing.      Furthermore, the Beeple sale has shown us that a legitimizing force like Christie’s can attract real-world wealth in enormous amounts. As real-world companies set up shop in virtual worlds, they will drive up property values around them and foster investment in new, community-building projects, building a new and valuable digital real estate ecosystem with credible players and significant price tags.      The rapid adoption of NFTs by the art world demonstrates just how quickly these changes can take place. So while today it might seem crazy to spend $10,000 on a parcel of pixelated “land,” take into consideration that some digital NBA TopShot cards that sold for $9 a pack in November have since gone for $200,000 each.      So we have established why digital real estate might have a value, but why do we think it might hold value or appreciate? It’s the same reason why people digital art and digital basketball cards are selling for more than their real world equivalents: transferability.      See also: Jeff Wilser - How NFTs Became Art, and Everything Became an NFT      You’ve surely heard stories of refugees sewing gemstones into the hems of their clothing to hide wealth and move it around as they emigrate. Crypto assets can be easily moved around. So not only is digital real estate increasingly perceived as valuable, but its transferability is what will catapult its value beyond any perceived utility or scarcity value.      Unlike real-world real estate, digital real estate can be sold within minutes without an attorney because its ownership history is logged on a self-contained decentralized, blockchain ledger. What’s more, digital basements never flood and digital buildings never need a new roof.      The escalating prices of NFTs and digital real estate today are small compared to what they may be worth in the future, once the rest of the world catches on. For that reason, I predict that the best parcels of virtual real estate will appreciate faster than real-world real estate.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MANA | MARKET | TRADING,Janine Yorio,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/03/17/what-nft-sales-mean-for-digital-real-estate,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4cb21fb5a3490d59cbac97d8ea275e3c2ca397a4-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
