Skyhook  is unique within the bitcoin ATM ecosystem for its low-cost, portable alternative to more well-known brands like Lamassu and Robocoin. First launched in mid-May, Skyhook is based out of Portland, Oregon.  In an announcement on its official blog, the Skyhook team said that demand has been steadily rising for its open-source ATMs. The company now aims to complete 1,000 sales before 2015.  Skyhook also hopes to continue its mission of providing small-scale bitcoin entrepreneurs with the means to establish ATMs and create grassroots-level exchange locations.  The company wrote:  “Our goal with Skyhook has been to make it possible for everyone to become a bitcoin exchange, so that the buying of bitcoin is easy, accessible, and not restricted to a single central source.”  Positive reception  The company said that customer feedback has been constructive and often positive, saying that problems among its clients are few. It added that ""we’ve gotten a lot of great testimonials and very creative use stories"".  In May, Skyhook COO Kyle Drake told CoinDesk that one of the company’s top priorities is to make it simpler for people to buy digital currencies.  He remarked:  ""We want to help solve the bitcoin purchasing problem by making it so anyone that wants to try and use bitcoin can just go to a nearby ATM, and get some with cash. The best way to do that is to make bitcoin ATMs affordable, so that anybody can get and use one.""  For more on Skyhook and its initial launch, read our full report.

42425808,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIgNHh,1403727314,Speculators Seek to Cash In on Bitcoin Domain Name Boom,"UPDATE (26th June 14:01 BST): Information about the price of BTCS.com has been added.      Bitcoin isn't the only digital asset changing hands for lots of money these days. The cryptocurrency has spurred a rising trade in associated domain names, with popular domains sometimes changing hands for hundreds of thousands of dollars.  Some domain name investors and brokers believe bitcoin has opened a new category in the sector.  Niko Younts is one such investor, and with good reason. It was he who sold the BitcoinWallet.com domain name for $250,000 in February, setting the high watermark for the category.  The sale of the domain gave a return of nearly 23 times the initial investment, he told CoinDesk, having purchased it for $11,000.  Low-hanging fruit  ""When I first dove into bitcoin in the fall of 2013 [...] I knew almost immediately that bitcoin was going to be hot global news, and there would be countless opportunities in the premium domain space related to this controversial 'thing' dubbed bitcoin,"" Younts said.  Confident in his prediction, Younts assembled a portfolio of 700 bitcoin and cryptocurrency-related domain names under the banner of Currency Evolution, the name he has given his project.  Younts showed CoinDesk a page listing what he said was the majority of his portfolio, saying he believes the bitcoin domain boom has only just begun.  However, ""the early-investor boom has definitely already happened,"" he elaborated, counting himself among the traders who profited from the low-hanging fruit.  Growing trend  Another domain name player who wants to cash in on the surge in bitcoin interest is Australia-based broker Domain Guardians. The firm is currently touting what it thinks is the next hot bitcoin property, the domain name BTC.com. If it can find a buyer for the right price, it takes a commission from the sale.  A co-founder of Domain Guardians, Mike Robertson, says there has been strong interest in the BTC.com domain name and an overall growth in attention to bitcoin-related domains.  ""The response we've received from prospective buyers has been very positive [...] We're currently in discussions with a number of companies,"" he said.  Jen Sale, another co-founder of Domain Guardians, added that the BTC.com domain fits in with the overall trend at the high end of the market for short, one-word domains that ended in the .com suffix.  She added that the demand for these properties was increasing, against a backdrop of growing interest in bitcoin-related domains, and claimed that her firm had brokered deals worth millions for such one-word .com domain names.  Cashing in  Sale probably isn't exaggerating. The domain industry can be big business. At Domaining.com, for example, a leaderboard tracks the most valuable domain sales.  Currently holding the top spot is Sex.com, which was bought by a company called Clover Holdings in November 2010 for $13m. Other entries in the top five include Hotels.com, which cost $11m in 2001 and Fb.com, acquired by Facebook for $8.5m in September 2010.  A domain name broker can take a commission of 10-20% from the sale. Sedo.com, for example, the largest domain name marketplace, also acts as a broker for some sellers and charges a 15% commission on successful sales.  This translates into tens of thousands of dollars for six-figure sale like BitcoinWallet.com and over a million in a major sale like Hotels.com or FB.com.  Some way to go  However, some industry observers indicate it could be some time before a bitcoin-linked domain name will reach those heights.  Ron Jackson, who publishes industry title Domain Name Journal, says the trade in bitcoin domains is too new for a discernible pattern to be observed:  ""There haven't been enough significant bitcoin-related domain sales to call anything a trend. The only major one we have seen this year is BitcoinWallet.com.""  Another domain name sale that is often cited by players in the sector is that of BTCS.com, which was purchased by Bitcoin Shop last February. The price was undisclosed, but domain name traders cite as an acquisition with a potentially hefty price tag. But Bitcoin Shop's chief executive Charles Allen tells CoinDesk that it was acquired for just $12,250, which is slightly more than the amount Younts paid for BitcoinWallet.com.  ""We believe this was a fair price for a four-letter .com domain name. However, we are surprised by the prices some owners are seeking,"" Allen said.  Domain investors like Younts, though, will hope that Jackson is proved wrong, and soon. Younts said that BitcoinWallets.com (note the plural in 'wallets'), which he also owns, has been attracting lots of attention from potential buyers, including three six-figure offers.  Prices rising  Younts also noted that competition and asking prices have been rising, saying that several domain names that include a country name and the word 'bitcoin' are now beyond his budget.  For example, CanadaBitcoin.com was going for double-digit bitcoin offers only, FranceBitcoin.com had a price tag of 30 BTC, and SeychellesBitcoin.com could be had for 10 BTC.  Perhaps fittingly for a trade spurred on by a decentralised cryptocurrency with a value that can fluctuate wildly depending on what buyers and sellers decide it is worth, Younts points out that domain name investing adheres to a similar dynamic:  ""There are no universal metrics for domain valuation from a buyer or seller [...] In many cases, [a domain name] owner is simply praying for a home run, but the name is worth what someone is willing to pay for it at the moment.""

42425804,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIgN9h,1403722269,BTC-e Empowers Veteran Investors with Advanced PAMM Trading Account,"BTC-e, the popular and highly secretive Europe-based digital currency exchange, has launched a new service to add percent allocation management module (PAMM) accounts to its platform, a move that effectively allows site traders to become money managers for other users.  BTC-e stated that the launch of PAMM accounts adds a ""proven and effective"" money management tool to the website, one used in traditional currency exchange markets.  PAMM account providers will be able to open account pages, which are then ranked based on performance and stability. Subscribers then search BTC-e for account providers that meet their risk and capital requirements before finally investing in a performance strategy. Profits are divided between the account provider and subscribers.  The exchange went on to suggest that it expects the offering to appeal to the wide range of traders who currently use the site to trade bitcoin, litecoin and host of additional altcoins, stating:  ""Whether you are a professional trader, or a beginner, PAMM technology opens up new opportunities for you to make profit from bitcoin trading.""  The launch of the PAMM service, together with its multi-currency trading accounts on 2nd June, follows a period of relative quiet for the exchange, which faced criticism in the wake of the collapse of Japan-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox for its lack of customer transparency and simplistic site design.  PAMM providers  The exchange noted that providers will gain a number of benefits from using the new PAMM accounts.  For example, BTC-e says providers can create multiple offers and conditions to interact with different pools of subscribers, thereby attracting investors with different risk attitudes and investment capabilities. Subscribers also receive automatic distribution of profits, a feature BTC-e says will allow providers to focus on generating successful strategies.  Providers are further protected against any infringement on their trading strategies. BTC-e says followers cannot ""duplicate [a] trading strategy beyond [the] PAMM service"", though the site doesn't suggest how this is achieved.  BTC-e suggests that launch of its multi-currency, Meta Trader 4 terminal earlier this month also played a role in supporting its newest offering. The terminals, the site says, will allow providers to trade funds.  PAMM subscribers  Subscribers will be given tools for evaluating provider accounts that BTC-e hopes will replace the need for these individuals to understand the intricacies of trading.  BTC-e notes it will provide ""visual graphs"" and ""accurate statistics"" on providers so that beginners can engage with more experienced traders.  Subscribers, it says, will then have the flexibility to withdraw money from a provider at any time so that they may select another offering suitable to their needs.  The site also suggests more updates to the program may be on the way, as an ""Agent"" section visible on the site includes tabs for referrals and commissions, which may be available to incentivize those who engage with its community of PAMM account users.

PayByCoin  integrates Intuit’s QuickBooks Online payment processing service with bitcoin wallet and merchant processing provider Coinbase.  Earlier this year, the business software developer began testing a bitcoin payments service geared toward small businesses. At the time, Intuit said that it was seeking to develop a low-cost, low-risk digital currency acceptance service for its merchants.  This service is now being offered free to Intuit customers that use QuickBooks online to create electronic invoices for customers. Merchants can opt to receive payments in either BTC or USD, and the company will charge no additional fees on top of the 1% transaction cost imposed by Coinbase.  The company stated that it won't be involved in the transaction process, but will rather serve as an interface that its customers will use to facilitate payments.  Intuit explained:  ""Intuit is providing the connectivity and software services to direct customers to the small business operators CoinBase wallet, and to record the transactions in QuickBooks Online. Intuit will not receive or hold any funds related to the PayByCoin transactions, either in USD or bitcoins.""  According to Intuit, PayByCoin is intended to broaden the variety of revenue sources for its merchant network, saying on its website:  ""Intuit is always looking to help our QuickBooks Online customers grow their business and get paid in any way they choose.""  Notably, Intuit is also the owner of personal financial planning platform Mint, which added Coinbase support earlier this year.

42425818,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIgNXh,1403717189,'Adopt a Node' Project Aims to Bolster Bitcoin Network Security,"A new non-profit project encouraging bitcoiners to “adopt a node” has launched.  Bitcoin nodes store a copy of the block chain, a public history of all transactions that have ever occurred, and also serve to verify and relay these transactions across the network.  A healthy number of 'full' bitcoin nodes (those running the bitcoin core client on a machine instance with the complete block chain) are required to maintain and secure bitcoin's distributed network.  However, the total number of full nodes has declined in recent months and encouraging an uptake in node provisioning has proven difficult.  Enter Fullnode, a project aiming to make it simpler for bitcoiners willing to tackle this growing problem.  For the greater good  In conversation with CoinDesk, Fullnode’s developer Or Weinberger explained how he rushed to put his automatic server provisioning experience to use when he learned of bitcoin's diminishing full node supply:  “I thought it would be cool if people who wanted to help the bitcoin network, but didn't know how, could simply send some BTC to an address and have a full node deployed for them.”  The number of active nodes continues to sit around the 8,000 mark, despite renewed concern about the stagnant supply. This is partially due to the fact that downloading the bitcoin daemon to provision a node is notoriously cumbersome and unlike mining, there's no reward for doing so.  Adopt a node  Fullnode offers a user-friendly way to contribute precious resources to the block chain, without draining the benefactor's bandwidth or disk space.  Each $10 donation fuels one node for a month. From the donor's end, the setup process is near-effortless: just minutes after they send their bitcoin to Fullnode (via Coinbase) the automatic server deployment agent will launch their node.  Additionally, from this weekend onwards users will also be able to name their server. For example, users could claim the name 'Satoshi' for satoshi.fullnode.co. Donors can choose to continuously refund, or 'top-up' their node it they wish.  The project wants to integrate a variety of provider pools to permit a more geographically distributed network. Linode and DigitalOcean have locations in North America, Singapore, the Netherlands, Japan and the United Kingdom. Weinberger has plans to integrate Google Compute Engine, which would add a few more locations to the list.  Users can verify that the nodes exist, and check out the rest of the global distribution, via a quick IP search on Bitnodes.  Nodes provide redundancy  Nodes broadcast transaction messages across the network before miners validate the transaction.  It is difficult to say exactly how many are necessary, but having a diverse pool of nodes to choose from could increase network security as the redundancy reduces the likelihood of double spending. Developers Jeff Garzik and Mike Hearn have both expressed concerns about the recent drop in node numbers.  Garzik even announced a partnership with Deep Space Industries, Inc. to send bitcoin nodes into space. The satellites, named 'Bitsats', could act as backup in the case of terrestrial failure.  The open-sourced Fullnode project offers an easy way for anyone to provision the network.  Today, there's no incentive to devote time and resources to the issue, unlike bitcoin mining, but perhaps the altruism of adopt-a-node could topple barriers to participation.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Alyssa Hertig,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/06/25/adopt-a-node-project-aims-to-bolster-bitcoin-network-security,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f8a64022fd00882c862962a964038780c600efe5-1024x582.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425800,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIgN3h,1403713783,Payments Industry Association: Bitcoin Has a Right to Exist,"The CEO of the Electronic Transactions Association (ETA), which can boast giants such as MasterCard, Paypal and Amazon among its members, believes that, while the technology has yet to fully mature, bitcoin could one day offer advantages for the payments industry.  Jason Oxman  told the Wall Street Journal that the industry is undergoing profound change, with the arrival of new mobile payment systems and services that are backed by numerous technological advances in the field.  Oxman indicated that he is enthusiastic about the rise of mobile transactions, biometric authentication and other cutting edge payment technologies, including bitcoin, saying:  “We are in, without question, the single most important period of innovation since the invention of the magnetic strip. It is truly a revolutionary time for payments.”  The 50-year-old magnetic strip, which stores data on credit and debit cards, is on the way out, thanks to newer microchips that allow biometric data to be embedded in new cards. Mobile devices, backed by near-field communication (NFC), Bluetooth LE, digital wallets and other emerging technologies are also vying for a slice of the payments market.  The fact that the payments industry still relies on decades-old technology is often used by its detractors in the bitcoin community who like to portray the industry as a dinosaur.  The situation is not that simple, though. Legacy support for old standards is still vital and upgrading the vast infrastructure used by financial institutions and merchants across the globe is a painstakingly slow process.  On the contrary, Oxman insists the payments industry is embracing innovation. He cited MasterCard and Visa as good examples, as both companies have already made serious commitments to mobile payments.  Potential in bitcoin  On the subject of digital currencies, Oxman was generally positive, conceding that the bitcoin network offers a more efficient backend for processing transactions than the complex, multilayered banking system. He further said that bitcoin companies might one day join the ETA.  However, Oxman did have a few caveats, with fraud and security risks remaining a key concern. While noting that the industry is paying attention to ongoing efforts to enhance security in bitcoin, he concluded that the digital currency still has not developed to the point where ETA members would feel comfortable deploying it as a payments solution.  “ETA's position on bitcoin and alternative currencies today is that they have a right to exist and they should comply with whatever laws [or] regulations apply to payment companies that offer services akin to [...] what they are offering,” he said.  The positive outlook from the ETA is not the first time we've heard such statements from industry leaders in the payments space. Realex Payments CEO Colm Lyon recently told CoinDesk that the industry will have to adapt and evolve, thanks to the arrival of bitcoin.

42425792,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIgJNh,1403708420,Mike Hearn: Underfunding is Leaving Bitcoin Development in Crisis,"Acclaimed bitcoinj developer Mike Hearn has expressed his concerns over the apparent lack of progress in the development of the bitcoin protocol.  In an audio interview with Epicenter Bitcoin, Hearn indicated that there are simply no incentives for developers to spend time and effort on basic development, and that the bitcoin protocol is already suffering as a result:  “I’ve been very worried for a long time that the core bitcoin system is radically underfunded and underdeveloped from where it needs to be.""  Because developers are not incentivised, he argued, they simply don’t tend to tackle the big problems and little progress is being made.  The result is that development of the bitcoin protocol has ground to a “complete halt”, Hearn added, describing the situation as a “crisis period for bitcoin, in this respect”.  Crowdfunding for bitcoin  Now, Hearn wants to do things differently – raising funds for bitcoin development through Lighthouse, his new crowdfunding platform which he compares to Kickstarter. The platform would allow people to pre-pledge and support projects without necessarily funding them, explaining:  “It’s just a promise. People could go back on that promise.”  The approach would allow developers to see whether their ideas can gain enough traction and funding before they actually start raising money. Hearn says a lot of people have already expressed interest in his concept.  “To start with, it would just be me. I want to see whether I would actually be able to make a living this way,” he said. If he is successful, Hearn expects more people to join the platform and contribute.  Community support  Hearn sees Lighthouse as a marketplace that will allow the bitcoin community to effectively ‘vote’ on the direction of bitcoin's development.  “We don’t want bitcoin to be controlled just by rich people. There has to be some reason to it,” he said.  “The companies have the funding, they’ve got their profits, they’ve got their venture capital. They need bitcoin to work well, so my plan is to mostly get these companies to pledge,” said Hearn, adding:  “BitPay or Coinbase or whoever – none of these companies wants to be the sucker that is always paying for the upgrades to bitcoin.”  Hearn argued that such an approach would level the playing field and benefit both big companies and startups.  When asked whether his plan would further centralise development, Hearn said it should do the exact opposite. “If I was to be working on it and I had a sustainable income stream, this could only decentralise it further, even if it’s just me,” he said. “This is free market-driven development.”  Developer issues  Hearn further took time in the interview to have a dig at the core developers, saying that nobody should be concerned by the direction they are taking, as they are doing very little:  “The only people doing any kind of heavy lifting on the protocol today are people paid by the Bitcoin Foundation. When I say ‘people,’ what I actually mean is Gavin [Andresen]. There are only three people paid by the Foundation to work on bitcoin, code-wise. And of those, Wladimir [van der Laan] and Cory [Fields] refuse to work on the protocol, partly because of the social issues that have come up.”  “There’s almost nothing happening on bitcoin core development. Only Gavin is working on any major updates and he can only tackle one at a time.”  This is not the first time Hearn talked about the lack progress in core development. Back in February he also indicated that too few people are putting in any real effort.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/06/25/mike-hearn-underfunding-is-leaving-bitcoin-development-in-crisis,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ffa20d54db33142a66e8a5c0db1cb1b707f9573d-1000x700.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425787,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIgJDh,1403705378,Swiss Government Report: Bitcoin Too 'Insignificant' for Legislation,"UPDATE (Thursday June 26th 13:45 BST) The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) has released an updated bitcoin factsheet, taking into account the findings of the Federal Council report. The FINMA factsheet outlines regulatory limitations and licensing requirements for bitcoin operators. Depending on the business model, bitcoin businesses may require a banking licence and some activities fall under money laundering regulations.  <hr />  Switzerland's Federal Council has published a report stating that, for the time being, it will not create legislation relating specifically to bitcoin or other digital currencies.  The government report claims the economic importance of these currencies is currently ""fairly insignificant"" and the council doesn't expect this to change in the near future.  This report has been created following the submission of postulates by National Councillors Jean-Christophe Schwaab and Thomas Weibel last year, which asked the Federal Council to examine the risks and opportunities associated with bitcoin.  No 'legal vacuum'  A point the government is keen to stress in the report is that virtual currencies are not in a ""legal vacuum"", meaning that existing laws apply to activities associated with these currencies. It states:    ""Contracts with virtual currencies are enforceable in principle and penalties can be imposed for criminal offences associated with virtual currencies. Certain business models based on virtual currencies are subject to financial market laws and need to be subjected to financial market supervision.      Professional trade in virtual currencies and the operation of trading platforms in Switzerland generally come under the scope of the Anti-Money Laundering Act. This includes compliance with the obligation to verify the identity of the contracting party and establish the identity of the beneficial owner.""    Some of the laws that apply to certain uses of digital currency include the Swiss Code of Obligations, the Federal Act on Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism in the Financial Sector, plus the Federal Act on Banks and Savings Banks.  Legal certainty  Schwaab told CoinDesk he was pleased the report had clarified the legal status of bitcoin: ""The report ensures legal certainty. That’s the most important topic at this point. Now, people who trade bitcoin can know which financial sector regulation applies or not.""  He went on to say he thinks the report underestimates the economic potential of bitcoin. He said:  [post-quote]  ""That’s a big mistake for a country like Switzerland with a strong financial sector. I hope the banking sector will be cleverer than the Government on that point, but I’m pessimistic.""  Schwaab even went as far as to suggest he is personally becoming increasingly bullish about digital currency.  ""In the last months, my personal views about bitcoin have evolved: the more I learn about bitcoin, the less I remain sceptical about it!""  Alexis Roussel, CEO of Swiss based cryptocurrency broker SBEX, said the report represented good news for the Swiss bitcoin ecosystem.  He was particularly interested in the parts of the report that are relevant to his company's plans to deploy a bitcoin ATM network within Switzerland.  ""Managing an ATM would be considered directly as money transmitting service, with tighter rules. This is starting to shape how bitcoins ATM will work,"" Roussel said.  He explained it means ATM operators would always need to be licensed, unless they can ensure the user is in control of the private key of the bitcoin wallet they are sending to.  ""This is imposing high standards in the bitcoin financial world, but this will be beneficial for consumers in the end,"" he added.  The risks  The report gives examples of the risks associated with bitcoin, stating that, while there is no risk of it damaging the country's existing financial sector, consumers are vulnerable to volatility and security issues.  It concludes by advising consumer protection organisations within the country to urge people to use caution when using bitcoin.

42425796,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIgJTh,1403701677,Could Eroding Net Neutrality Hurt Bitcoin?,"Bitcoin is a payment mechanism designed to level the playing field, driving out unnecessary costs and making it possible for even the lowest income members of society to participate in the economy. But it relies on a free and open Internet to do so.  In the US, the rules governing Internet access are changing, threatening net neutrality – the principle that lets everyone use the Internet in the same way. Where would that leave bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies?  It helps to think of the Internet like a giant switched city road system, with packets of information traveling along it from different sources.  The roads have a finite capacity, so digital traffic lights must switch the traffic, enabling everyone’s packets to get through at roughly the same rate. Net neutrality principles keep everyone’s packets whizzing through the network with the same priority.  “But”, say telecommunications companies, “we built those digital roads, and the likes of Google, Facebook and Netflix are using them to make money for themselves. How about we charge some companies for the right to get their packets through ahead of others’?”  It seems to make economic sense – unless you’re one of the companies providing those services, or one of the people using them. Unless those deals are cut for your online services, you might find them slowing down because other traffic is prioritised. But if the deal is cut, someone has to pay those extra costs.  That’s not fair, say net neutrality advocates, some of whom would like the Internet to be regulated as common carriers, in a category known as Title II. This would force them to act in the public interest, making it impossible for them to cut backroom deals with content providers.  New rules  That kind of regulation doesn’t appear likely now. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) lost a battle with Verizon earlier this year - and with it, the right to stop ISPs from throttling others’ traffic.  Instead, the agency (now incidentally headed by former telco industry lobbyist Tom Wheeler) promised to introduce new rules that would once again prevent ISPs from throttling traffic. It is in a 120-day public consulting period on that right now.  But those rules may still allow ISPs and content providers to cut deals to make each others’ traffic faster in exchange for payment. This angered net neutrality advocates, who saw it as a way to push a two-tier system through the back door.  It angered congresspeople too, a few of whom launched a bill this month to try and preserve net neutrality.  But what does all this have to do with bitcoin? Not much, if you listen to cryptocurrency software engineers. Potentially lots, if you listen to businesspeople and lawyers.  Net neutrality and bitcoin  Bitcoin developer Mike Hearn waves away suggestions that a system allowing ISPs to discriminate between different kinds of internet traffic could be used to throttle bitcoin:  “Of course, it's technically possible. Bitcoin does not try to hide its network traffic. But I do not think ISPs have any interest in doing so, as there's no ‘Bitcoin, Inc’ that they could try to ransom. Besides, bitcoin doesn't need much bandwidth the way most regular end users run it.”  But Marvin Ammori, a first amendment lawyer and Internet policy expert at Stanford Law School’s Center for Internet and Society, warns that there could be problems ahead for payment systems like bitcoin.    “If you need to pay AT&T, Comcast, etc for quality of service (the ‘fast lane’), you might end paying per transaction or a percentage of revenue and you have to pass on those costs.      That means that paying AT&T etc adds transaction fees where the bitcoin network and cryptocurrency would have otherwise eliminated it.”    Ammori, who studies net neutrality policy closely, is a strong advocate. Today, he filed a letter with the FCC on behalf of mobile payment firm Dwolla, the Internet payment processor that shuttered its bitcoin business in November.  The letter warns that the proposed rules could scupper payments by harming competition and innovation, and by making it more difficult to conduct real-time fraud detection.  “When it comes to payments, net neutrality represents a powerful equalizer for small businesses that do not have the volume or frequency to negotiate reduced interchange fees with payment processors,” says the Dowalla letter.  “Without neutral access to the Internet, such businesses would face higher costs or competitive disadvantages in reaching users, and therefore might not even be in a position to take advantage of low ­cost payment processing.”  This isn’t the only letter complaining about the possible effect of a ‘non-neutral’ Internet on payments. Ammori also points to a letter, signed by what looks like half of the US tech venture capitalist community, warning the FCC of a chilling effect on innovation if net neutrality were to be threatened.  We’ve been here before  Nick Grossman, a partner at Union Square Ventures with several bitcoin firms in his portfolio, warns that this kind of thing has happened at the time.  “We've seen cases where ISPs have historically degraded and blocked service for certain protocols (bittorrent) and services (Google Wallet), so bitcoin is certainly in the realm of technologies that could be threatened if ISPs are able to block and degrade technologies at will,” he muses.  He’s referring to December 2011, when AT&T Wireless, Verizon Wireless, and T Mobile all blocked Google Wallet from reaching subscribers. They were also, coincidentally, developing a mobile payment service of their own, called ISIS. There may not be a ""Bitcoin Inc"" for ISPs to go up against, but it is possible that under the right legal conditions, they could use a non-neutral Internet to protect their own interests.  How could the bitcoin network protect itself against disruption from incumbent ISPs? The Bitcoin Foundation’s chief scientist Gavin Andresen thinks that it could all be done in software.  “I don't worry about net neutrality. Bitcoin runs nicely inside Tor and other censorship-resistant networking technologies,” Andresen says.  “If some governments or ISPs did decide to try to censor crypto-currency network traffic I'm sure we'd see pull requests to make running over Tor or I2P even easier than it is today.”  Hearn is already building Tor-style support into BitcoinJ, the Java implementation of bitcoin.  Routing around censorship  Another option might be to create an alternate network, providing a different physical layer altogether for sending packets to and from bitcoin users.  Jeff Garzik's BitSat network, currently under development, could be one solution. The network, which will see tiny cubesats in orbit, can distribute an accurate version of block chain data to notes on the ground, although this is really designed to protect against Sibyl attacks, and other attempts to disrupt the integrity of the block chain on the ground.  The Bitcoin Card, proposed by the team behind the Mycelium wallet, was originally to have included wireless meshed networking, enabling bitcoin users to communicate with each other directly. However, this would require a critical mass of users, and the blog for the project hasn’t been updated since mid-2013.  Other alternate networking concepts include the FreedomBox, an attempt to facilitate private, secure networking via the use of a hardware box installed residentially. There are also some community networks, which provide networking links to local communities using open wireless links and optical fibre. Guifi.net is a good example of a community network.  These networks would still have to use an upstream provider that was sympathetic to net neutrality, but these do exist. Guifi connects directly to an Internet peering point, the Catalunya Neutral Internet Exchange Point (CATNIX).  Such alternative networking initiatives seem far-fetched, however, in a world dominated by the likes of Comcast and Verizon. Building up community meshed networks is an ad hoc process, requiring significant critical mass to be effective.  Still, according to some, the erosion of net neutrality is a clear and present threat for payment systems like bitcoin. Alexis Ohanian, a co-founder of reddit and east coast ambassador at San Francisco-based incubator Y Combinator, is an activist for open Internet causes.  “Payment systems need speed. And bitcoin in particular needs low transaction costs. My chief concern is that without Title II reclassification, ISPs either crush competitors or impose a tax on all online transactions that'd upset even Walmart and Target,” he says.  “Given all the innovation we're watching (and investing in) around cryptocurrencies and the future of payments, the free market should pick the winners and losers,” he concludes. “Not cable companies.”  Internet cable image via Shutterstock",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/06/25/could-eroding-net-neutrality-hurt-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8ad3951166a83f64006307ba4b6dac833c3a0d17-1000x662.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425807,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIgJXh,1403693113,MaidSafe COO Reflects on Lessons Learned from Crowdsale,"MaidSafe was founded in 2006, when founder David Irvine, a former IT consultant, decided to create a new platform to improve Internet security.  Computers running MaidSafe talk to others on the network to create a large storage array (the firm’s name stands for ‘Massive Array of Internet Disks, Secure Access for Everyone’).  Participants can choose how much storage they provide to the network, or can choose to use the system while providing none at all. Any storage allocated is used by the network to store encrypted portions of other users’ files.  It has now been over two months since MaidSafe raised millions of dollars in a crowdsale using the mastercoin protocol, which was criticised by some observers for the way in which it was conducted.  So, what is happening at this Scottish company, based in the sleepy fishing village of Troon, and what is their view of the crowdsale controversy?  How MaidSafe will work  The network uses two encryption methods. First, a file is encrypted using MaidSafe’s own algorithm, which uses the data in the file to encrypt itself. Then, MaidSafe obfuscates the data further by running it through another, public encryption standard (AES256). The network randomly decides which machines will be used to store the data chunks.  The idea is that you can store your sensitive data without anyone being able to read it, firstly, because it’s encrypted, secondly, because the parts are scattered around the Internet, and thirdly, because no one knows where those parts are.  The developers have been slowly writing the underlying software since the firm filed its patents, shifting programming language, from Python to C++, partway through. Now, they’re in the middle of testing the network.  How can a system like MaidSafe be reliable, however? If a computer hosting your file is switched off, then how can you access your data?  “The system keeps a minimum of four live copies of a file,” said Nick Lambert, who is in charge of marketing and operations at MaidSafe. There are also ‘dead’ copies left on machines that disappear from the network with the potential be turned back on and once again become available, he explains.  When a live copy disappears, the network recreates that chunk on another node within 20 milliseconds, said Lambert. This happens randomly, using an algorithm to avoid live files being stored in close geographic proximity:  “We expect the network to be extremely robust in that regard.”  MaidSafe has a foundation, set up as a charity, to hold its patents, which the firm says are purely defensive. It may have noble goals, but it also has a for-profit business model.  The firm will charge a fee to companies seeking to use its network for their own commercial services. If, for example, Dropbox wanted to provide its users with more secure storage, then it might decide to connect its service to the MaidSafe network, and it would be asked for a percentage of its revenue.  MaidSafe has a nominal figure of 1%, although it would have to be negotiated on an ad hoc basis, in practice.  'Development pods', the network of third-party developers that MaidSafe is currently building, will also develop their own apps, bolstering the ecosystem and earning more money themselves.  The other part of the system that also generates money is safecoin – the cryptocurrency that enables MaidSafe to work.  Safecoin  Like bitcoins, safecoins are generated by the network or participants. However, rather than being mined, they are awarded to a participant of the network whenever someone retrieves a chunk of data from a device that they own. The more data that users retrieve from the network, the more safecoins are generated.  The person retrieving a file doesn't necessarily pay the fee, explains Lambert. Instead, payments are made and received according to network usage. If, for example, someone uses less storage than they provide on the MaidSafe network, they are likely to earn more coins than they spend.  “Your wallet is incremented by the network. It will potentially be invisible. The system will entirely manage it,” Lambert said. “If you’re a developer, you’d hard-code your safecoin wallet address into your application, and based on how much it’s used, the system provides safecoin to that address autonomously.”  If, on the other hand, you choose to use the network without providing any storage, then you will be paying for services without receiving any payments. In that case, you’d have to buy safecoins to spend them on network services. There will be a decentralized exchange allowing people to buy and sell safecoins, Lambert confirmed.  The system can handle millions of transactions per second, and confirm them at network speed, rather than bitcoin’s block chain system, which takes 10 minutes. MaidSafe uses its own version of a block chain, which it calls the 'transaction manager'.  Unlike the bitcoin block chain, which contains a complete transaction history for the entire network, the transaction manager only knows the existing and the previous owner of a safecoin. ""In that way, we are likening it to digital cash,"" Lambert said.  Lessons learned from the crowdsale  The world will be watching as MaidSafe rolls out its technology, but it has already observed the company's crowdsale, which took place in April. Designed to help fund further development, the firm made 10% of all safecoins available to buyers, through a proxy token called the MaidSafeCoin.  The company allowed people to pay in bitcoins, or in mastercoins, and it reached its $8m target in just five hours, having originally allocated 30 days for the crowdsale.  The sale may have generated a lot of money, but it didn't go entirely to plan, Lambert admitted. The firm had to convert any bitcoins paid by investors to mastercoin, in order to run the sale over the mastercoin protocol.  ""As we got near to the crowdsale it became apparent that the amount of mastercoin that was being loaned to us was not sufficient to cover the number of bitcoin that we anticipated receiving,” he said, adding:  “So we chose to try and fix the amount of MaidSafeCoins that you received in relation to mastercoins at a slightly higher rate so that we would have a sufficient number of mastercoins available to run these conversions.""  MaidSafe did this because it thought the price of mastercoin would increase, meaning that most people would pay for their MaidSafeCoins using bitcoins instead. In fact, the price of mastercoin didn’t increase as quickly as the firm had anticipated, meaning that people were instead using cheap mastercoins to buy MaidSafeCoins.  The end result of this was that MaidSafe received more mastercoins in payment than it expected.  BitAngels, the angel investment group which was helping out with the crowdsale, expected mastercoins to comprise no more than 25% of the overall investment. Instead, Lambert explained, they ended up making up roughly half of the investment total.  The firm published a post-sale analysis here, detailing some of the challenges that it faced, although a multi-million-dollar crowdsale in five hours is still a result that many firms contemplating crowdsales would aspire to.  Lambert said:  “A lot of people questioned why we would use two currencies, and looking back we [should] have used one.”  The price of mastercoins fell shortly after the crowdsale, and the value of the funds raised now amounts to around $6m.  “The mastercoins, we still have. The bitcoins are what we’re living off,” said Lambert, concluding:  “We’re pretty hopeful that as their protocols and tools are rolled out to others, that it will start to become a more liquid layer and the price of mastercoin will increase to the level that it was at during our crowdsale. It’s been a currency without a huge amount of function until this point.”  So what's next for MaidSafe?  The company will continue testing its software, and has a succession of testnets to implement for network testing purposes before it considers the network ready for prime time. The company is not setting a date for release, Lambert said, pointing out that software developer deadlines generally aren't met.  So, for now, we watch and wait – and anyone else considering a crowdsale will have a lot to learn from the company's experience.
