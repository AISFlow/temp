7256026,https://newsbtc.com/?p=515286,1673186668,Dogecoin (DOGE) Is Now 4th Most Popular Cryptocurrency On BitPay,"Dogecoin, a dog-themed meme crypto that appears to enjoy strong ties with tech billionaire and Twitter owner Elon Musk, appears to be struggling to gain enough ground for a major upward swing. After peaking at $0.0749 on January 5, DOGE fell victim to a price retracement that pulled it all the way down to $0.0705 the following day. Since then, the altcoin launched a mini rally to recoup some of its losses, enabling it to notch a 2.4% increase in value over the last seven days. According to tracking from Coingecko, at the time of writing, Dogecoin is changing hands at $0.0719 and despite its early struggles this year, it is able to strongly keep its place as the 8th largest cryptocurrency courtesy of its market cap which currently stands at $9.90 billion. Dogecoin Still Among The More Popular Crypto Assets Although still far from rewarding its faithful holders with significant profit through a massive price hike, DOGE continues to establish itself as among the well-known digital currencies. Just recently, BitPay, one of the world‚Äôs leading crypto payments processors, revealed that the meme token is the fourth most popular transactional currency in its platform. Related Reading: Ethereum Classic (ETC) Price Balloons To Nearly 30% In Last 7 Days Source: Bitpay According to data shared by the company, in December 2022, Dogecoin accounted for 10% of all transactions it processed, almost doubling the 6% tally it had in June. The memecoin placed behind Bitcoin (1st, 41.81%), Litecoin (2nd, 25.51%) and Ethereum (3rd, 11.53%). This development could be interpreted as an indication that more and more people are using the digital asset as a means of exchange. Along this line, leading Indian cryptocurrency trading app CoinSwitch with more or less 20 million users mentioned in its report that DOGE was included in the list of the most popular virtual currencies owned by its customers.

For example, when the Tesla CEO completed his controversial purchase of social media giant Twitter back in October 2022, DOGE‚Äôs price registered a significant uptick, from $0.0720 in October 27 to $0.1572 on November 1.

A quick review at some data points for the digital asset reveals that it is currently trading at an overbought position which might cause buyers to be ‚Äúexhausted‚Äù and unable to sustain a further rally, yielding technical advantage to the bears once again. Moreover, the altcoin‚Äôs Bollinger Bands indicate that it is extremely volatile at the moment, making it susceptible to significant price swings that could happen in just a wink of an eye. This makes Ethereum Classic a more risky asset to trade or hold. Related Reading: Lido DAO Surges By More Than 57% in Just A Week ‚Äì More Gains Up Ahead? Image: Coinpedia Ethereum Classic: A Quick Glance At Impressive Run According to latest tracking from Coingecko, at the time of writing, ETC was changing hands at $19.82.

During the last few days, Ethereum Classic was among the few cryptocurrencies that managed to post double-digit gains within the previous week led by Solana which surged by an astonishing 35%. As for the reason, some experts believe that the pivotal turnaround in the hash rate of the ETC towards the end of 2022 paved the way for miner profitability which, in turn, increased the number of transactions processed by the asset‚Äôs network. In fact, during the last two days, Ethereum Classic transaction count surged and hit a new monthly high. Following this, ETC recorded a 12% increase in its trading price, indicating that the spike in volume triggered an upward movement for the altcoin‚Äôs value.

Coincodex, however, seems to disagree with this thesis as its forecasts for ETC remains bullish despite technical indicators saying otherwise.

7245666,https://newsbtc.com/?p=515211,1673168179,Shibarium Developers Say Each On-Chain Transaction Will Burn SHIB Tokens,"Shibarium is one of the most anticipated projects, mainly in the Shiba Inu community; most SHIB community members are eager for the launch as it could be enough of a catalyst to pump their SHIB bags. Latest on the news about the layer two blockchain scaling solution, the developers announced via a short thread on Twitter earlier today that every transaction on the Shibarium network would result in a burn of Shiba Inu (SHIB) token. Shibarium Burn Mechanism To Boost SHIB Price Over Time? Currently, SHIB has a circulating supply of 589 trillion units and a total supply that exceeds 900 trillion. Its initial total supply was reduced with a recent burn and with the soon-to-be-introduced burning mechanism by Shibarium, SHIB‚Äôs price is likely to appreciate as the supply will be reduced. Though the amount of SHIB token that will be burned after each transaction has not been revealed, the burning mechanism is likely to be a good enough catalyst for not only the SHIB token but the Shibarium blockchain.

Shibarium developers noted that BONE will be the only token that would be used for gas fees and ‚ÄúNo other tokens will be necessary to operate within the protocol.‚Äù For context, BONE is a governance token of the Shibaswap ecosystem, allowing the SHIB community to vote on upcoming proposals in the ecosystem. The more BONE coins a user holds, the more weight their vote carries in future proposal. Though it may seem as though BONE is the main character of the Shibarium blockchain, it is not, but more of a partner that will work hand in hand with SHIB. ‚ÄúShibarium has been developed for SHIB token and not for the sake of other projects who claim ownership or speculation surrounding its operability dependency on any other tokens,‚Äù the Shibarium team announced.

This no longer comes as a surprise as the crypto asset is in the midst of an incredible run that enabled it to post double-digit gains on its intraday, weekly, bi-weekly and monthly charts. At press time, according to data from Coingecko, LDO is changing hands at $1.51, increasing its value by 13% during the last 24 hours. Over the previous seven days, the digital token went up by 56.5% while also posting a bi-weekly gain of 60% and monthly increase of 50%. Already in the middle of an impressive showing, some analysts believe that Lido DAO still has room for improvement, thanks to a new upcoming ETH upgrade. Related Reading: MATIC Advances 6.5% In Last 7 Days ‚Äì Can It Sustain Gains For Another Week? Image: The Crypto Times Lido Expected To Benefit From ETH Shanghai Upgrade According to a recently released analysis, Lido Finance, at the time of this writing, is responsible for nearly 30% of all staked ETH tokens, making it the largest liquid staking platform for Ethereum right now. It has been noted that the demand for the platform increased dramatically after Ethereum switched from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake mechanism back in 2022. Moreover, the analysis stated that the blockchain‚Äôs upcoming Shanghai fork will enable users to withdraw their staked ETH tokens which, in turn, is expected to encourage more people to stake through Lido Finance. This will then increase the demand for the project‚Äôs native token. Some experts believe that these are just some of the triggers that helped the crypto asset go up by more than 55% in just seven days and will also play a vital role in the altcoin‚Äôs attempt to sustain its bullish run. LDO total market cap at $1.28 billion on the weekend chart | Chart: TradingView.com ‚Ä¶ But LDO Could Lose Its Momentum Although things are looking good right now, there‚Äôs still a chance that LDO could enter a price correction phase that will not only halt its upward movement but will also make it lose most, if not all of its current gains. LDO is currently in an overbought territory and has reached a point for psychological take-profit zone which are indications of an impending intense selling pressure.

On Friday, Jan. 6, the DeFi project tweeted a statement asking liquidity providers on its platform to withdraw their tokens from certain pools valued at $6.3 million. Via their official Twitter handle, the decentralized exchange stated there was a security risk that could not be resolved by the platform‚Äôs emergency DAO. Thus, they advised LPs to immediately remove their assets from all affected pools.

Interestingly, amid the ongoing problem of the decentralized exchange, several investors appeared to have retained their faith in the platform‚Äôs native cryptocurrency BAL. In the last 24 hours following Balancer‚Äôs warning, BAL has appeared unaffected, decreasing in value only by 0.13% based on data from CoinMarketCap. At the time of writing, the ERC-20 token is exchanging hands at $5.35, with its market cap value set at $248,354,921, representing only a 0.11% negative change over the last day. BAL trading at $5.34 | Source: BALUSD chart on Tradingview.com While it is still too early to determine the effect of the Balancer security problem on BAL‚Äôs market performance ‚Äì especially with the details still unknown ‚Äì these early signs show that BAL may pull through this period, and investors need not panic. Related Reading: MATIC Advances 6.5% In Last 7 Days ‚Äì Can It Sustain Gains For Another Week? Is Balancer Experiencing Another Crypto¬†Exploit? Like every coin in the cryptoverse, there is no given certainty on market patterns. While Balancer has not revealed the nature of the security risk and has assured the public of full disclosure after a successful mitigation, much speculation is still flying around the crypto community. Many suspect a smart-contract exploit as it won‚Äôt be the first the Ethereum-based DEX would fall victim to such. In August 2020, Balancer was hacked, leading to the loss of $500,000 worth of ETH. However, compared to 2020, when Balancer was still a budding crypto project, the DeFi protocol currently ranks as the fourth biggest decentralized exchange with a TVL value of $1.49 based on data from the DeFi analytics platform Defillama. If the current fears of exploitation are confirmed, the consequences may be quite drastic for a crypto market that is currently trying to recover after the crash of the FTX exchange late last year. In November 2022, FTX, formerly one of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges, collapsed, causing the crypto market to lose billions of dollars. The crash was due to heightened leverage and solvency concerns about FTX‚Äôs trading arm Alameda Research, leading to many investors trying to withdraw their assets from the exchange simultaneously, which resulted in a liquidity crisis and, ultimately, bankruptcy.
