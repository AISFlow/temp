29786722,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=625827,1719010823,"Bitcoin Slips Under $64,000: Here’s Where The Next Support Is","Bitcoin has continued its recent bearish trajectory during the past day as the asset’s price has now slipped under $64,000. Here’s what the next support looks like for BTC. Bitcoin Has Strong On-Chain Support Between $61,900 & $63,800 According to data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, BTC is floating just above a critical on-chain demand zone. Demand zones refer to price ranges where many investors last bought their coins. These ranges can be determined through on-chain analysis, as the average cost basis of each address on the network can be readily calculated through its transaction history. Related Reading: PEPE Has 80% Of Holders In Profit: How It Compares To DOGE & BTC Below is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the various price ranges near the current asset price in terms of the present demand. In the graph, the size of the dot corresponds to the number of addresses bought inside the respective range. It appears that Bitcoin currently has large demand zones both just above and below itself. According to IntoTheBlock data, the lower range currently holds the cost basis of around 1.23 million addresses for investors who bought 319,700 BTC. Now, what’s the relevance of a demand zone like this? To any investor, their cost basis is important, so when the price tests it, they may become more prone to making some move. Naturally, if many holders share their break-even level inside a narrow range, the reaction resulting from a retest would also be large. Because of this reason, zones of major demand are considered to be important support or resistance levels for Bitcoin. Cost basis centers above the price can act as resistance walls, while those below can provide support cushions. Since BTC is hovering just above a major demand zone between $61,900 and $63,800 after its latest decline, it’s possible that the range could help the asset reach a bottom. As for the source of the support or resistance effect provided by these demand zones, the answer lies in investor psychology. The holders currently in loss may be looking forward to the price hitting their cost basis to exit with their initial investment. This selling that may appear upon a retest of many investors’ shared break-even level can pose resistance to BTC. Similarly, the investors below can react to a retest by buying more, as they could look at the drop as a dip opportunity, thus supporting the asset.

Bernstein Analysts Raise Bitcoin Target To $200,000 In a note to clients, Bernstein analysts, Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra predicted that Bitcoin could reach $200,000 by the end of 2025. This new price target comes after analysts foresaw BTC hitting $150,000 earlier in May. At the time, the analysts disclosed that they anticipated about $70 billion in inflows from Spot Bitcoin ETFs between 2024 and 2025. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Worldcoin (WLD) Price Surged Over 15% In One Day To Reach $3 Presently, the analysts have solidified their predictions, reiterating that Spot Bitcoin ETFs would be the trigger driving Bitcoin’s price to $200,000 next year. Analysts have estimated that Spot BTC ETFs could grow in demand to represent about 7% of the total BTC in circulation. They disclosed their expectations for Spot Bitcoin ETFs to grow significantly in adoption, highlighting possibilities of approvals from major wirehouses and large private banking platforms in Q3 and Q4. The analysts also disclosed that almost 80% of Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows are generated by self-directed retail investors who invest through brokerage platforms. They believe that institutional investors’ demand for Spot BTC ETFs is still in its early stages. However, as the market continues evolving institutional investors’ interest could rise, adding massively to the current inflows in Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Bernstein analysts wrote in their notes to clients that currently around $15 billion of net new flows have been brought in by ETFs combined. The cumulative inflows in Spot Bitcoin ETFs according to Farside data, have reached $14.66 billion since its launch on January 11. Due to the high demand and massive capital pouring into this asset class, analysts expect Spot Bitcoin ETFs to be equivalent to 7% of BTC’s circulating supply by 2025 and 15% by 2033. They also anticipate Spot Bitcoin ETF’s total Assets Under Management (AuM) to reach $190 billion by ‘the 25E market peak and a whopping $3 trillion by 2033. This bullish prediction underscores the analyst’s confidence in Spot BTC ETFs, despite it being a newly discovered asset class. In less than six months, the total assets under management for Spot Bitcoin ETFs have grown to $59.19 billion, with an average expense ratio of 1.07%. This massive growth has been spearheaded by leading asset management companies like BlackRock, Fidelity and others. BTC Price Enters Fresh Bull Cycle In their note, Bernstein analysts also declared that BTC has officially entered a new bull market cycle. The analysts disclosed that this bull cycle is currently driven by the recent Bitcoin halving event, which took place on April 20. Related Reading: Dogecoin Enters Final Stage Of Consolidation, Analyst Predicts 6,150% Rally To $7.5 They anticipate the rise of new catalysts that could trigger an increase in demand for BTC, propelling its price to new levels. In contrast, crypto analyst, Michael van de Poppe has predicted that BTC has likely reached its bottom between the price range of $63,000 and $65,000. As of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading at $63,865, reflecting a weekly decline of 4.76%. Poppe has suggested a potential reversal on the horizon, predicting that Bitcoin could find itself in upward momentum soon.

42407998,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga8evv,1719004381,"This Is Why Altcoin Investors Struggle Despite Bitcoin, Ether Sitting Near Yearly Highs","Crypto majors such as SOL, AVAX, APT, SUI saw 40% to 70% corrections over the past months, weighing on altcoin sentiment, while BTC and ETH are down only 15% from their yearly highs.  Venture funds are under pressure to sell tokens to realize profits on their investments made in the past years, Markus Thielen noted.  The lack of capital inflows to crypto markets ""has particularly bad implications for tokens with large upcoming unlocks as well as new [tokens] and airdrop programs,"" Anagram partner David Shuttleworth said.  The cryptocurrency market is undergoing a healthy consolidation after a massive run-up from October to March – at least for those who invested in the two largest digital assets.  For those who hold smaller cryptocurrencies, though, this is a brutal correction, with sentiment in crypto social media circles resembling bear market despair.  While bitcoin {{BTC}} and Ethereum's ether {{ETH}} are only 15% below their yearly highs, several crypto majors like solana {{SOL}} and avalanche {{AVAX}} are down 40% to 50% from their March peaks, while layer-1 challengers sui {{SUI}} and aptos {{APT}} have cratered 60% to 70%.  Selling pressure from venture funds with broadening supply token unlocks, lack of fresh inflows to crypto and seasonal trends all contributed to weakness in altcoins, a term used to describe cryptocurrencies beyond the biggest ones like bitcoin and ether.  High dilution  Many altcoins experience a constantly diluting supply of tokens via unlocks and distributions scheduled for years ahead. This is because most of the tokens are locked up, bought by early investors or earmarked for ecosystem developments and grants.  For example, Ethereum layer-2 network Arbitrum's token {{ARB}} is nearing its all-time low price from last September, even though its market capitalization has risen to $2.5 billion from $1 billion because of a massive increase in its supply.  Another example is solana, whose supply is inflating by 75,000 tokens, worth some $10 million at current prices, every day.  ""Unlike equities which have a constant passive bid from ETF inflows and bond buybacks, crypto, and in particular altcoins, have the opposite – a constant stream of sell pressure,"" Quinn Thomson, founder of crypto hedge fund Lekker Capital, noted in an X post.  A significant portion of the selling pressure comes from venture capital funds realizing profits on their early investments in projects launched over the past years.  ""Venture capital funds invested $13 billion in Q1 2022, while the market turned into a steep bear market,"" Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, said in a report earlier this week. ""Those funds are now under pressure from their investors to return capital as artificial intelligence (AI) has become a hotter theme.""  When the market's appetite for the smaller, more speculative crypto assets is dwindling and trading volumes are falling – like in the past few months – there's not enough demand to absorb this supply shock.  Read more: Crypto Markets Under Pressure as $2B Worth of Altcoin Token Unlocks and $11B Bitcoin Distribution Loom  Lack of fresh inflows  Liquidity inflows to crypto markets have also stalled or even reversed over the past weeks, shown by the market value of stablecoins, which are mostly used as an intermediary for crypto trading.  The combined market capitalization of the four largest stablecoins – Tether's USDT, Circle's USDC, First Digital's FDUSD and Maker's DAI – has been flat since April after a $30 billion expansion earlier this year, per TradingView data.  Stablecoin balances on exchanges – which translates to dry powder for traders and investors – decreased $4 billion to the lowest level since February, David Shuttleworth, partner at Anagram, pointed out in an X post citing Nansen data.  ""This has particularly bad implications for tokens with large upcoming unlocks as well as new [tokens] and airdrop programs,"" Shuttleworth said.  Recently launched tokens of blockchain bridge Wormhole (W), yield-bearing synthetic dollar protocol Ethena (ENA) and layer-2 network Starknet {{STRK}} all plummeted roughly 60% to 70% in price from their respective highs and will face billions of dollars worth of tokens being distributed in the coming years.  Seasonal trends have been also bearish for smaller tokens, with June usually being a down month for altcoins.  TradingView data shows that the aggregated market cap for crypto assets excluding BTC and ETH, captured by TOTAL.3 metric, saw a decline in every June during the past six years.

Dogwifhat (WIF) has not been the exception. The memecoin sensation of Q1 saw a significant price drop following the movements of a whale. Recently, an address transferred millions of WIF to a crypto exchange, which ignited speculation about who was behind the transaction. Related Reading: LayerZero’s ZRO Token Airdrop Receives Backlash For ‘Proof-Of-Donation’ Mechanism 6 Million WIF To Binance On Friday, reports of a massive WIF transfer to Binance hit the crypto community. Per the report, one of the top dogwifhat holders moved millions to the largest crypto exchange. The whale transferred 5.97 million WIF, worth around $11 million, on June 21. Additionally, the address offloaded 48 million Trump Coin (DJT), approximately $500,000. After the news, the crypto community began speculating who was behind the transfer. Some users claimed the whale was crypto trader Ansem, who was very vocal about WIF. The trader was also part of the Las Vegas Sphere project, where users donated around $700,000 to project the token’s image in the Sphere. Users on X criticized Ansem for the alleged deposit, expressing their disappointment in his “capitulation”. Some investors took the opportunity to express their discontent with the trader for “grifting and dumping on investors.” The discussion sparked an important conversation: should Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) not move their money? One user considers that Ansem, and all KOLs, are free to do what they want with their money. The user argued that KOLs are subjected to criticism regardless of their route. When people sell before you do, they are “jeet”. When KOLs sell some of their holdings or even move it around, they are “pump and dampers”. Several community members agreed and questioned if KOLs are “obligated” to hold a token until investors are happy with their profits. However, others argue that community members are “arbiters” of traders’ reputations. Dogwifhat Take A Blow, But Was It Ansem? Despite the rumors, online reports suggest the wallet is not linked to the crypto trader. After deep-diving into the address, a community member found that the address was not associated with Ansem. The post notes that the only reason it was linked to the trader was the large WIF balance and many Solana memecoins. However, the address has a record of selling their token at a loss “to FOMO into new shiny stuff.” Furthermore, the wallet seems to be linked to a now-deleted X account. At the time of writing, the trader has not acknowledged the rumors. After the reports, WIF’s price dropped from the $1.90 to the $1.80 price range. On the last day, the memecoin plunged from the $2.15 mark, representing a 13% decrease. Related Reading: Curve (CRV) Bounces 40% From All-Time Low As Whales Go On Shopping Spree The token has also seen a 25.3% and 36.1% drop in the weekly and monthly timeframes. Crypto analyst Bluntz forecasted a bearish $1 target for the dog-themed memecoin. Ultimately, the analyst stated that a descent to the $1 support level was “inevitable” before the “next parabolic leg.” As of this writing, WIF is trading at $1.83.

29778804,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=625848,1718994638,Survival of the Fittest: Here’s How Bitcoin’s Next Rally Hangs on Miner Capitulation,"Amidst a backdrop of declining Bitcoin prices and economic uncertainty, renowned crypto analyst Willy Woo has offered a forecast that suggests a complex road ahead for BTC, with potential gains on the horizon after some ‘inevitable’ turbulence. Bitcoin Rally Hangs On Miner Capitulation, How? Bitcoin’s current market behavior is largely influenced by its miners, whose actions can significantly impact its price. According to Willy Woo, the key to understanding when Bitcoin might start its recovery lies in observing miner capitulation and the subsequent recovery of the hash rate. Related Reading: Bitcoin And Solana Brace For Quiet Q3: What Crypto Traders Should Know Miner capitulation occurs when less efficient miners, unable to sustain profitability, are forced to sell their holdings and exit the market. This phase is critical as it typically decreases selling pressure, allowing for market consolidation and setting the stage for potential price increases. Woo points out that this cycle is not a quick one. Historical data from previous Halving events, which reduce the reward for mining Bitcoin, show that recovery can take time. I’ll break it down in simple terms. When does #Bitcoin recover? It’s when weak miners die and hash rate recovers. This one is for the record books as it’s taking a lot of time for miner capitulation post-halving. Probably can thank ordinal inscriptions boosting profits. pic.twitter.com/19MB0b8mHO — Willy Woo (@woonomic) June 20, 2024 The current cycle appears prolonged, with miners taking longer than usual to capitulate due to the profitability provided by new market mechanisms like ordinal inscriptions. This extended adjustment period might be difficult for investors, but it is a necessary step toward achieving a healthier market. Key Indicators to Watch: Hash Ribbons and Market Signals Willy Woo emphasizes the importance of monitoring Bitcoin’s hash ribbons. This indicator provides insights into the economic viability of Bitcoin mining. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miners’ Reserves Deplete Amidst High OTC Selling, What This Means A reduction in hash ribbons suggests that the cost of mining is becoming more aligned with the market price of Bitcoin, signaling that the worst of the sell-off may be over and a recovery could be forthcoming. In addition to hash ribbons, Woo advises investors to keep an eye on broader market signals. Here’s a view of just how much paper bets on #Bitcoin there is right now. The solid yellow chart is a z-score oscillator looking at how significant it is locally. We need a solid amount of liquidations still before we get the all clear for further bullish activity. https://t.co/tswxQwxlc1 pic.twitter.com/TwGG5tf50z — Willy Woo (@woonomic) June 19, 2024 For instance, the current speculative environment in Bitcoin, marked by a high volume of theoretical trading, requires a series of liquidations to achieve market balance. This clean-up phase, although painful, is essential for setting a solid foundation for the next bull run. The analyst noted: I know it sucks, but BTC is not going to break all time highs until more pain and boredom plays out. On the bright side, miners are capitulating and when that is through, it nearly always ends in a huge rally. Look for compressions in this ribbon. Buy and hodl in these regions.

Many institutions are still in ""wait and see"" mode while early movers can capture ""oversized market share,"" the report added.  The market of tokenized assets might be just $4 trillion even in an optimistic scenario by 2030 as financial institutions embrace blockchain technology for traditional financial instruments at a slower pace and limited range of assets than more optimistic reports predicted, global consulting firm McKinsey & Company said in a Thursday report.  ""Broad adoption of tokenization is still far away,"" the authors said, noting the number could be as low as $1 trillion. ""As infrastructure players pivot away from proofs of concept to robust scaled solutions, many opportunities and challenges remain to reimagine how the future of financial services will work.""  Tokenization emerged as one of the hottest use cases for blockchains during this bull market as global asset managers and banks such as BlackRock, Citigroup and HSBC along with native digital asset firms are putting old-school assets such as U.S. Treasuries and commodities – also known as real-world assets (RWA) – to blockchain rails in hopes for operational efficiencies and broader access among benefits.  The trend gained widespread attention over the past year with reports by Boston Consulting Group and digital asset manager 21Shares predicting the tokenized asset market to reach several multiples of the McKinsey estimate by the end of the decade.  Read more: Why Asset Tokenization Is Inevitable  The McKinsey report said that tokenization is at a ""tipping point,"" with many projects stepping out from pilot to deployment at scale.  In its base case, the company estimated the tokenized asset market to reach nearly $2 trillion market size by 2030, notably excluding tokenized deposits, stablecoins and central bank digital currencies from calculation.  McKinsey's $4 trillion bullish scenario would be supported by more accommodating regulations, industry-wide collaboration and without any systemic events happening that would hinder adoption.  Mutual funds, bonds, exchange-traded notes, repurchase agreements (repos), alternative funds, loans and securitization will be the frontrunners of tokenization efforts, according to the report.  Meanwhile, the authors see slower adoption for assets such as real estate, commodities and equities, citing reasons like marginal benefits, concerns over feasibility, complex compliance requirements or lack of incentive for key industry players to pursue tokenization.  Many institutions still are in ""wait and see"" mode anticipating a clearer signal to implement tokenization, which may put early movers in position to capture ""oversized"" market share, the report added.  ""Blockchain technology is still in early days and requires a material amount of integration with existing processes and standards,"" Anthony Moro, CEO of Provenance Blockchain Labs, said in a note to CoinDesk.

This unusual behavior was highlighted by CryptoQuant, a crypto on-chain analytics company. The peculiar behavior is noteworthy because it is associated with a growing open interest in XRP in comparison to other cryptocurrencies, suggesting XRP is primed for a major price move. XRP Open Interest Surges According to CryptoQuant data initially noted by an analyst associated with the analytics platform, recent news involving the SEC and Ripple, XRP’s parent company, has seen the open interest for XRP resuming an uptrend. Related Reading: Bitcoin Crash Below $66,000 Stuns Market, Why A Drop To $54,930 Is Possible As per the CryptoQuant chart below, the open interest, which has generally been in an uptrend since April 15, recently took a hit in the first week of June and started to decline concurrently with a fall in the price of XRP. However, the open interest has now rebounded and has resumed its uptrend. Interestingly, this increase is more significant than that of other cryptocurrencies, considering many crypto prices have struggled in the past week. The rising open interest also relays the current sentiment among XRP investors, as it indicates that investors are opening more positions in anticipation of an increase in the price of XRP. How Will This Affect Price? Open interest refers to the total number of outstanding derivative contracts that haven’t been settled. Climbing open interest often signals more money flowing into the market. This is evident in the chart above, as increases in open interest have mostly been registered with a corresponding increase in the price of XRP. Furthermore, open interest is considered a leading indicator for many savvy investors. When it soars, it signals that new money is flowing into the market as traders open new positions. This increased activity and liquidity can foreshadow where an asset’s price might be headed next. Regardless of the direction in which the price heads, one outcome is nearly guaranteed: more volatility. Related Reading: Dogecoin Enters Final Stage Of Consolidation, Analyst Predicts 6,150% Rally To $7.5 At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $0.486 and has increased by 1.44% in the past seven days. Despite this meager increase, it’s interesting to note that XRP is currently the only asset among the top 20 largest cryptocurrencies still in the green zone in the past week. Adding to the bullish outlook is the strong trading volume over the past few days. According to data from Santiment, some traders are still bearish on XRP despite the fact that it is currently outperforming many other assets. XRP is also traders shorting to counter the bulls. However, as Santiment noted, this is a good sign for patient bulls, as the shorting activity can act as ‘rocket fuel’ for continued price rises when they eventually become liquidated.

29773481,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=625837,1718983816,"Uniswap A Retailer’s Hub? Average Trade Sizes Fall From $30,000 to $1,000 In 2 Years","Crypto and some key sub-sectors, like decentralized finance (DeFi) or non-fungible token (NFT) trading or minting, remain dynamic. While activity is highly influenced by price, other changes are settled not by how prices gyrate but by time. Uniswap Users Are Increasingly Posting Small Trade Sizes Events in Uniswap, a leading decentralized exchange (DEX) on Ethereum, draw the interest of Token Terminal, a blockchain analytics platform. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Worldcoin (WLD) Price Surged Over 15% In One Day To Reach $3 According to Token Terminal, a curious trend is happening in Uniswap: While the Ethereum ecosystem is expanding and expected to grow even more, trade sizes on Uniswap are shrinking rapidly. Over the last two years, the average trade size on the popular DEX has fallen from around $30,000 registered in 2022 to roughly $1,000 at press time. Commentators speculate that this trend could point to increasing adoption, especially among retailers. Compared to institutions or crypto hedge funds that might want to trade huge chunks, most retailers lack those resources. They are more comfortable with lower trade sizes. This observation makes sense, especially with the explosion of meme coins deployed on the mainnet or layer-2 platforms like Base. Though Uniswap first launched on the Ethereum mainnet, it is also available on Base, Arbitrum, and Polygon. It enables the trading of tokens in a low-fee environment. On these platforms, market participants can trade on smaller sizes since they know the fee impact will be lower than on the mainnet. Another perspective suggests that the rise of competing DEXs built on alternative blockchains like Solana and BNB Chain might be drawing activity away from Uniswap. Modern blockchains like Solana offer faster transaction speeds and lower fees. With Ethereum processing 15 TPS at optimum, the higher scalability and interoperability with the first smart contracts platform can appeal to some traders. DEX Users Rapidly Climbing As Ethereum Finds Regulatory Clarity The decline in trade size comes surprisingly alongside a surge in overall DEX activity. Another Token Terminal report shows that monthly active traders across leading DEXs, including Uniswap, stand at 11.2 million. It is roughly 3 million short of the all-time posted in December 2021. This observation suggests that though more traders post smaller sizes, more users are keen on exploring and participating.

29770851,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=625803,1718978406,"Bitcoin Drops Below $64,000, But Arthur Hayes Advocates ‘Buy The Dip’","Bitcoin is experiencing a significant decline today, dipping below the $64,000 mark to a low of $63,564. This drop represents a 2.5% decrease in the last 24 hours and an overall 12% decline over the past two weeks. Amidst this downward trend, Arthur Hayes, the co-founder of BitMEX, is not only maintaining his bullish stance on Bitcoin but actively encouraging investment, advocating a strategy to ‘buy the dip.’ His optimism and advice are deeply rooted in an analysis of global economic conditions and central bank policies, which he believes will favor cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Buy The Bitcoin Dip? Hayes’s insights draw attention to the aggressive monetary policies implemented by central banks, particularly the US Federal Reserve. These policies, including rapid interest rate hikes—the most aggressive since the 1980s—were initiated in response to rising inflation in the United States. The hikes have had a profound impact on the bond market, particularly affecting US Treasuries (USTs), which saw a decrease in prices due to the rising yields. Japanese banks, in search of yield amid domestically near-zero interest rates, had heavily invested in these USTs. Related Reading: 3 Reasons To Invest In Ethereum, 1 To Stay Bitcoin-Only: Bitwise CIO The strategy backfired when US rates rose, leading to significant paper losses for these banks. Hayes specifically points to the situation with Norinchukin Bank, which was compelled to sell off $63 billion in foreign bonds, mostly USTs, to reduce these losses. This scenario underscores a broader trend among Japanese banks, which may need to continue offloading USTs and other foreign bonds as they adjust to the new economic realities imposed by US monetary policy. Hayes argues that these developments have critical implications for the crypto market, particularly Bitcoin. He notes that the responses by central banks to stabilize financial markets—such as the Federal Reserve’s decision to provide a blanket backstop in March 2023 following a series of bank failures—indirectly benefit cryptocurrencies. This intervention led to a surge in Bitcoin’s price, reinforcing its status as a viable alternative investment during times of financial instability. Moreover, Hayes points out the operational details of the FIMA repo facility, which was expanded by the Fed to bolster liquidity. He explains, “A rise in the FIMA repo facility indicates an addition of dollar liquidity to the global money markets. Y’all know what that means for Bitcoin and crypto … which is why I thought it necessary to alert readers about another avenue of stealth money printing.” This mechanism allows central banks to exchange their holdings of USTs for dollars, increasing the dollar supply without flooding the market with bonds and potentially driving up yields. Related Reading: German Government’s Bitcoin Dump Surpasses $195M As Selling Spree Persists The implications for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are profound, according to Hayes. He suggests that as central banks, particularly the Bank of Japan, might use these facilities to manage their exposure to USTs, the resultant increase in dollar liquidity could drive investors towards cryptocurrencies. This movement is seen as a hedge against potential inflation and currency debasement resulting from these monetary expansions. Hayes vividly describes the effect of these macroeconomic maneuvers on the crypto market: “Just as many began to wonder where the next jolt of dollar liquidity would come from, the Japanese banking system dropped Origami cranes composed of crisply folded dollar bills upon the laps of crypto investors. This is just another pillar of the crypto bull market. The supply of dollars must increase to maintain the current Pax Americana dollar-based filthy financial system.” In a rallying call to the crypto community, Hayes concludes, “Say it with me, ‘Shikata Ga Nai’, and buy the fucking dip!” Through this declaration, he underscores his belief that despite the volatile market conditions, the underlying economic and monetary developments are creating favorable conditions for Bitcoin’s growth. His analysis suggests that savvy investors should view the current price drops as buying opportunities, given the broader economic backdrop that he believes will continue to propel interest and investment in cryptocurrencies.

Contrarian bulls, however, might take comfort as indicators tracked by analysis firm Santiment show that crowd sentiment for BTC is now in its fourth week of “extreme negative” reading.  “The crowd is mainly fearful or disinterested toward Bitcoin,"" the firm said in an X post Friday. ""This extended level of FUD is rare, as traders continue to capitulate,” they added. ""BTC trader fatigue, combined with whale accumulation, generally leads to bounces that reward the patient.""  Santiment’s Weighted Sentiment Index measures bitcoin mentions on X and compares the ratio of positive to negative comments and trading volumes to gauge what the crowd is generally feeling about bitcoin. The index, which shows a -0.73 reading as of Friday, has been negative since May 23.  Elsewhere, data from Google Trends shows a decline in retail search interest. The tool allows users to compare the relative volume of searches. A line trending downward means that a search term's popularity relative to other popular terms is decreasing. Worldwide searches for “bitcoin” have steadily fallen since March 2024, data shows.  BTC prices have generally suffered in the past few weeks amid $1 billion in sales from large holders, dollar strength and a strong U.S. technology index market that may be drawing investor money.  Outflow activity from U.S.-listed spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has also reached its worst since late April, with $900 million leaving the products so far this week. These figures are nearing the $1.2 billion in total net outflows in trading sessions from April 24 to May 2.

Decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) Osmosis voted to adopt a fee-free Bitcoin bridge to allow bitcoin {{BTC}} to move into the Cosmos ecosystem.  Key to the process is a revenue-sharing agreement with Bitcoin bridge Nomic, according to an emailed announcement shared with CoinDesk on Friday. A bridge is a way of improving interoperability of blockchains by allowing users to move crypto assets from one system to another.  The revenue-sharing deal may address the one of shortcomings of bridges: how the different parties earn revenue from deposits and withdrawals. The proposed agreement will align Nomic's protocol revenue with usage of its bridged BTC, the announcement said.  The goal is to remove some of the friction users may previously have experienced when bridging their bitcoin holdings to other ecosystems for decentralized finance-related (DeFi) activities.  With less than 24 hours remaining until voting concluded, 95% of votes from the Osmosis DAO community were in favor of the deal.

This development is thanks to the recent strides that the Worldcoin team has made to achieve the goals of the crypto project. Expansion Of Worldcoin’s World ID Provides Bullish Momentum The Worldcoin team recently announced that World ID, the project’s global identity network, would be making an entry into Ecuador. Locals in the country can get verified using the Orb to join Worldcoin’s identity network. The team mentioned that verifications will be available at six locations across two Ecuadorian cities. Related Reading: Dogecoin Enters Final Stage Of Consolidation, Analyst Predicts 6,150% Rally To $7.5 Verification will begin at the port city of Guayaquil on June 26, while the other verification locations will be set up in the Capital city of Quito on June 27. Worldcoin stated that anyone 18 years or older who is interested in joining the over 5 million people participating in the Worldcoin network can get Orb verified in either of those two cities. This development undoubtedly provides bullish momentum for the Worldcoin token, considering the role the crypto token plays in achieving the team’s vision of providing a global identity for everyone. Worldcoin’s entry into Ecuador is also a much-needed boost, given the regulatory scrutiny and negative publicity that has overwhelmed Worldcoin’s ecosystem. Worldcoin also noted that its upcoming launch in Ecuador comes at a time when the project is set to expand further in Argentina through direct investments in the country and the launch of more Orb verification locations. As part of the investment, Worldcoin contributors such as Tools for Humanity (TFH) will sponsor professional opportunities for at least 50 developers, operations specialists, software engineers, data analysts, and other professionals in the country. Additionally, Worldcoin announced that 50 World ID orb verification locations, including two experience stores, will be set up in over ten cities across Argentina. These locations are expected to open sometime during the summer in the country. More Good News For Worldcoin Kenya’s local media, The Star, recently reported that the government has dropped its investigation into Worldcoin. Worldcoin had earlier had to suspend its World ID verifications in the country following allegations of unlawful collection and transfer of personal data belonging to locals. Related Reading: Bitcoin Crash Below $66,000 Stuns Market, Why A Drop To $54,930 Is Possible However, upon investigating and reviewing these allegations, the country’s Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) determined that they had no substance and directed that the investigation be dropped with no further action from law enforcement agencies. The Star noted that this development will likely pave the way for Worldcoin to resume its operations in Kenya. Worldcoin’s operations in Kenya were largely successful. Over 635,000 Kenyans are said to have downloaded the World App, although more than half of these individuals had yet to verify their identity using the Orb.

Approval of bitcoin spot ETFs changed how individuals invest in bitcoin, removing operational risks associated with alternative strategies like investing in mining companies. IBIT provides substantial liquidity to investors with $19.7b in AUM with a low bid/ask spread. iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ) is one of many institutional bitcoin ETFs launched this year after the SEC’s approval of bitcoin ETFs on January 10, 2024 . This event significantly changed how retail investors could access the coin by allowing them to indirectly invest in the cryptocurrency without outright purchasing them through a separate exchange. IBIT, like other ETFs, can be purchased through any brokerage account, whether taxable or tax deferred. From an advisor’s perspective, it would be prudent to allocate upwards of 5% to IBIT as a proxy for BTC; however, looking at BTC from a short-term trader’s perspective, the coin appears to be going through a downcycle. I recommend IBIT with a BUY recommendation for long-term investors seeking to gain exposure to BTC in their retirement accounts. Given the volatility of BTC, I cannot recommend a price target for IBIT. I believe the approval of bitcoin spot ETFs also had major implications to how individuals invest in their bitcoin strategy. Prior to the release, investors either had to open a separate brokerage account with the likes of Binance or FTX, adding additional risks of solvency, or indirectly invest in the cryptocurrency through investments in public companies that mine bitcoin, like Marathon Digital ( MARA ) and CleanSpark ( CLSK ), or invest in firms that outright purchase bitcoin on behalf of their investors through massive debt issuances, such as MicroStrategy ( MSTR ). Each of these alternative strategies poses their own inherent risk. MARA and CLSK must continuously invest in their infrastructure in order to reach profitability, especially post-BTC halving. FinChat FinChat The risk involved adds additional capital and operating costs to generate ~30-50% less revenue. As for MSTR, the biggest risk is the firm’s solvency as the firm cannot support itself through operating cash flow. FinChat IBIT significantly changed the game for retirement accounts and removed the operational risk as found in these indirect BTC plays. For the average investor, this can be significantly beneficial, especially given the amount of assets BlackRock manages. So, for those seeking to invest in BTC and deciding which strategy they should go with, I’d go with the ETFs as it adds direct exposure without any additional operational risks. Though I personally do not invest in BTC, I believe that there is a certain degree of value that can be extracted by holding BTC in one’s portfolio. BTC can be seen as a geopolitical and inflationary hedge. BTC has also been viewed as a hedge against the broader market; however, taking into consideration the volatility index ( VIX ), the S&P 500 ( SPY ), and the NASDAQ ( QQQ ), it is quite clear that the asset class is correlated to downside risk with the NASDAQ index. I believe much of this correlation is driven by the institutionalization of the asset class, in which day-to-day consumers are no longer the only investors buying and selling BTC. I believe that bringing BTC to a more public market through ETFs has added rebalancing risk to the broader theme, making the value of BTC more correlated to the broader market. TradingView This can also be seen when comparing BTC with real interest rates and gold. BTC is mostly negatively correlated to real interest rates, making them somewhat more associated with gold prices in terms of direction. TradingView I believe that these factors debunk the idea that BTC should be valued as an independent asset class. This doesn’t necessarily indicate that BTC is a bad investment; but rather, it should be understood that BTC is likely to be sold off when the broader market sells off, given that it has become institutionalized. FRED So, given these factors, inflationary data and key rates driven by the Federal Reserve should be eyed in order to make long-term decisions on whether or not to invest in BTC. If rates were to decline, BTC may pose a great opportunity to hedge against declining rates. That being said, it has become clear that it is not likely that the Fed will reduce rates given the continuation of elevated inflation. FRED Another benefit IBIT brings to the table is liquidity. The fund has a NAV of $19.7b with a bid/ask spread of 3bps. As of June 18, 2024, the ETF is trading at a 6bps discount to NAV, making this an appealing buying opportunity, assuming the price of BTC prices up. iShares Though I cannot discern on the direction of BTC as this isn’t my trading niche, I can discern on some macro thoughts that may affect the direction of the asset class. I believe that there may be some downside risk to BTC in the near-term as we exit the hype-cycle post-ETF launch. Given the flood of money that flowed into the ETFs upon launch, there may potentially be additional downside risk if investors are seeking to raise cash. The Block I also expect that the Fed will keep rates higher for longer with no cuts in eCY24 as inflation remains sticky above 3%. This may lead to a continuation of higher interest rates and less liquidity to be allocated to BTC. On a technical basis, it appears that BTC may be in a downcycle in anticipation of a rebound in inflation rates. This could pose a challenge to long-term holders of IBIT and BTC. TrendSpider IBIT Recommendation From an advisor’s perspective, it would be prudent to allocate upwards of 5% into IBIT to gain exposure to the asset class, as it may realize inverse returns to real interest rates. From a trader’s perspective, BTC appears to be going through a downcycle and may continue through this cycle if the new set of investors fear realizing losses in the asset class. Given the neutrality of this thesis and the purpose of investing in IBIT as a proxy for BTC, I recommend this product with a BUY recommendation for long-term investors.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4700308-ibit-is-a-great-vehicle-for-btc-investing-bitcoin-etf?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/29768279.jpeg

Nevertheless, bid-ask spreads remain elevated, a sign the tokens are still considered relatively risky.  Executing trades in prominent meme coins is easier than ever now that liquidity, as measured by 1% market depth, has surged to record highs, according to data tracked by Paris-based Kaiko.  The combined figure for DOGE, SHIB, PEPE, WIF, BONK, GROK, BABYDOGE, FLOKI, MEME, HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu and HarryPotterObamaSonic, recently rose to $128 million, the data shows. The figure describes the total value of buy and sell orders within a 1% range of the current market price. The deeper the liquidity – that is, the higher the figure – the easier it is to execute large orders at stable prices.  Generally, increased liquidity leads to a narrower gap between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay and the lowest a seller is willing to accept, the bid-ask spread. Tighter spreads ensure better trading pricing and reduce the cost of executing trades. Meme coins, however, aren't responding, according to Kaiko, and the bid-ask spreads remain above 2 basis points on most centralized exchanges.  ""This suggests that while more market makers are venturing into providing liquidity for these tokens, they are still considered risky due to their high volatility,"" Kaiko added.  ""While part of this increase is related to price appreciations, many small-cap meme tokens such as Dogwifhat (WIF), Memecoin (MEME), or Book of Meme (BOME) have seen significant growth in liquidity in native units, ranging from 200% to 4000%,"" Kaiko said in a weekly newsletter.",NEUTRAL,WIF | BOME | MEME,MARKET | TRADING | WIF | BOME | MEME,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/06/21/meme-coin-liquidity-hits-record-high-even-as-bid-ask-spread-spotlights-risk,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9d6741a51934e747b7f7b2bb10d2a85a9e68eb86-1280x720.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin fell to its lowest in over a month during the European morning, slumping to $63,500. This is the first time BTC has dropped below $64,000 since mid-May. At the time of writing, the bitcoin price is around $63,900, a fall of 3.5% in the last 24 hours. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), a measurement of the broader digital asset market, has dropped just under 2.3%, while ETH is down 2.25% at $3,500 and SOL has fallen almost 3.8% to $132.24.  Spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. recorded a fifth straight day of outflows on Thursday, taking their total losses for the week to $900 million, the highest outflow activity since late April. Data tracked by SoSoValue shows that the 11 listed ETFs lost $140 million on Thursday, with $1.1 billion in trading volumes. Grayscale’s GBTC – which has mostly seen outflows since its conversion to an ETF in January – led with $53 million followed by Fidelity’s FBTC at $51 million. BlackRock’s IBIT, the biggest ETF by assets held, was the only product with net inflows, adding $1 million. The others saw zero net change.  Standard Chartered is establishing a spot trading desk for bitcoin and ether, Bloomberg reported on Friday. The London-based desk will start operations soon and be part of the bank's FX trading unit, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter. Standard Chartered would become one of the first global banks to enter spot cryptocurrency trading, though others, such as Goldman Sachs, have been trading crypto derivatives for several years. Standard Chartered's involvement in cryptocurrency is now well established, as a backer of digital asset custodian Zodia Custody and its exchange arm Zodia Markets.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the U.S. and other developed and major emerging economies are still in a late expansion stage of the business cycle and not yet in recession.  Hence, some analysts foresee another leg higher in bitcoin before the business cycle rolls over into recession, causing widespread risk aversion.

29766457,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=625808,1718967623,XRP Faces Extended Bearish Pressure At $0.4937 Amid Market Weakness,"XRP, one of the leading cryptocurrencies, is currently grappling with extended bearish pressure amid prevailing market weakness. The digital asset has been facing significant downward momentum, influenced by a confluence of factors including macroeconomic uncertainties, regulatory challenges, and broader market sentiment. Thus far, XRP’s price has struggled to maintain key support levels, exacerbating concerns among traders and investors about its near-term performance. As bearish momentum continues to dominate, this analysis delves into evaluating XRP’s current market position with the help of key technical indicators focusing on the 4-hour and the 1-day chart. The price of XRP has increased by 0.63%, trading at about $0.4920 in the last 24 hours, with a market capitalization of more than $27 billion and a trading volume of more than $1 billion as of the time of writing. There has been a 1.06% decrease in market capitalization in the last day despite the trading volume being up by 5.89%. XRP Current Market Performance And Trend Currently, the price of XRP is actively bearish trading below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) in the 4-hour timeframe, and the price here is beginning to decline after a failed upward attempt. With the current price formation, it can be suggested that XRP’s bearish trend may likely extend. Also, the Composite Trend Oscillator confirms that XRP’s decline may be extended as both the signal line and the SMA of the indicator are descending from the overbought section toward the zero line. In the 1-day chart, XRP is trading below the 100-day SMA attempting to move upward. It should be noted that this is just a short-term move as the crypto asset’s price at some point will begin to drop again thereby extending the bearish trend. Additionally, the formation of the 1-day Composite Trend Oscillator indicates that XRP’s bearish trend may likely extend as both the signal line and the SMA of the indicator are trending below the zero line closed to the oversold zone. Navigating The Bearish Market For The Token With XRP currently facing significant bearish pressure, It should be noted that if the crypto asset continues bearish as predicted, it will begin to move towards the $0.4663 support level. If it breaks below this level, it will decline further to test the $0.4088 support level and may move to test the $0.3483 support level if it breaches the $0.4088 level.

Chrissy Houlahan visited Tigran Gambaryan in Kuje prison.  Hill asked the U.S. embassy to advocate for the humanitarian release of the Binance executive.  Gambaryan has been detained in Nigeria since February.  U.S. lawmakers Rep. French Hill (R-Ark.) and Rep. Chrissy Houlahan (D-Penn.) visited Tigran Gambaryan in a Nigerian prison on Wednesday as the Binance executive remains incarcerated facing money-laundering charges due to his involvement with the crypto exchange.  Visiting the country to discuss anti-terrorism efforts,""we also had the opportunity to advocate for an American that's been wrongfully detained by the Nigerian government in the horrible prison that we got to go see, that's called Kuje prison,"" Hill said in a video posted to his X account on Thursday.  Hill said Gambaryan, who has been held since arriving in February for talks with the government, is suffering from malaria and double pneumonia. The executive reported he has lost significant weight and is being denied access to adequate medical attention, Hill said.  Shortly after being detained, Gambaryan was moved to the prison, whose inmates include members of the terror group Boko Haram. Another Binance executive held with him has since escaped.  ""We have a taskforce in Congress that is on Americans wrongfully detained abroad, or held hostage. Clearly in our view, Tigran fits in that camp,"" Hill said in the video. ""We want him home and we can let Binance, his employer, deal with the Nigerians.""  Hill added that he had asked the U.S. embassy to advocate for the humanitarian release of Gambaryan because of the ""horrible conditions in the prison, his innocence and his health.""  Hill was among the signatories of a June 4 letter to President Joe Biden urging him to work for Gambaryan's release. Two days later, over 100 former prosecutors wrote to Secretary of State Antony Blinken to echo this message, Hill said.  Meantime, the trial continues. Yesterday, the cross examination of a witness from the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission began. The case continues today.

This rally comes amidst positive developments within the Pendle ecosystem and a high-profile investment from industry veteran Arthur Hayes. However, concerns regarding token distribution threaten to cast a shadow over Pendle’s long-term prospects. Related Reading: AI Crypto Fetch.ai (FET) Makes ‘Big Bounce’ – Volume Spikes Over 200% Ahead Of Merger Hayes Fuels The Fire: Crypto Whale Ignites Investor Confidence The recent price surge can be partly attributed to a strategic move by Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX and a prominent figure in the crypto space. Pendle tallied a 25% increase from its lowest point this week to an intraday peak of $6.21, after Hayes publicly announced his acquisition of Pendle tokens, a move interpreted by many as a sign of confidence in the project. After Arthur Hayes(@CryptoHayes) tweeted that he is adding $PENDLE and $DOGE to his bags, one of his wallets bought 92,339.6 $PENDLE($554K) through #Wintermute. He transferred 2.05M $USDC to #Wintermute, then received 280 $ETH($1M) and 92,339.6 $PENDLE($554K).… pic.twitter.com/wo2Sl4245B — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) June 20, 2024 This endorsement from a seasoned investor with a successful track record, like Hayes’ involvement with the fast-growing USDe stablecoin, has undoubtedly bolstered investor sentiment towards Pendle. Pendle’s Ecosystem Takes Flight: TVL Skyrockets, User Base Expands Beyond Hayes’ influence, Pendle’s own internal developments are driving the current momentum. The project’s total value locked (TVL), a key metric reflecting the total value of crypto assets deposited within the protocol, has witnessed a significant uptick. The surge in TVL suggests that more and more people are using Pendle’s DeFi features. These features let users earn impressive yields on their crypto holdings, with some reaching as high as 25%. That’s significantly better than what most users get from traditional investments like short-term US Treasuries. On top of that, the number of Pendle token holders keeps climbing, which shows a growing and active user base for the protocol. Total crypto market cap at $2.28 trillion on the 24-hour chart: TradingView.com A Cloud On The Horizon: Token Distribution Raises Concerns While the current outlook for Pendle appears promising, a potential hurdle lies in the project’s tokenomics: a small number of addresses control a substantial portion of Pendle’s circulating supply. This concentrated ownership structure could lead to market manipulation in the future. Furthermore, the planned release of additional tokens into circulation raises concerns about potential dilution of existing token value. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales On The Move – Is A $100,000 Price Tag Coming?

29761152,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=625771,1718956831,"3 Reasons To Invest In Ethereum, 1 To Stay Bitcoin-Only: Bitwise CIO","In a recent commentary shared on X, Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise Asset Management, which ranks as the world’s largest provider of cryptocurrency index funds, detailed why investors should consider diversifying their cryptocurrency portfolio by adding Ethereum (ETH), alongside maintaining a position in Bitcoin (BTC). Hougan offered three compelling reasons for investors to embrace ETH, while also presenting a critical viewpoint for remaining invested solely in BTC. Ethereum Vs. Bitcoin: 3 Reasons Pro-Ethereum Hougan began by emphasizing the importance of diversification within crypto investments. Drawing an analogy to the early days of the internet, he pointed out how difficult it is to predict which technologies or companies will dominate over the long term. “It is very hard to predict the future with precision,” Hougan remarked, referring to investors who bet on early internet companies like AOL and Pets.com, which failed to maintain their initial promise despite the internet’s overall growth. Related Reading: Ethereum At A Crossroads: Big Move Coming After Consolidation Phase? Applying this lesson to crypto, Hougan advised a diversified approach to hedge against similar uncertainties. Ethereum’s current market capitalization stands at approximately $420 billion, which is substantial but still only about one-third that of Bitcoin’s $1.3 trillion market cap. Given these figures, Hougan proposed a default starting allocation of 75% Bitcoin and 25% Ethereum for investors seeking broad market exposure. Hougan’s second point delved into the functional differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum. He described Bitcoin as primarily “a new form of money,” highlighting its design choices aimed at enhancing its utility as a robust monetary system. “Every design choice the Bitcoin ecosystem makes is designed to make Bitcoin the best form of money that has ever existed,” he stated, underscoring Bitcoin’s targeted development toward optimizing its use as a currency. Conversely, Ethereum is characterized by its role as a foundational technology for building new applications that leverage its capability for programmable money. This includes everything from issuing stablecoins to enabling complex decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems. “Ethereum’s primary function is making money programmable,” Hougan explained. He argued that the ongoing development within the Ethereum ecosystem provides a broader exposure to the potential applications of blockchain technology, which is still in its nascent stages. Related Reading: Double-Whammy For Ethereum: Price Collapses, Exchange Supply Dries Up The third argument for Ethereum centered on historical performance data. Hougan pointed out that historically, portfolios that included Ethereum along with Bitcoin showed better performance metrics, both in absolute terms and when adjusted for risk, across full crypto market cycles. “My favorite thing about that table is that the +ETH portfolio has both higher returns and a lower maximum drawdown,” he highlighted. This historical analysis suggests that Ethereum could offer better downside protection and higher potential returns, though Hougan cautioned that “past performance is no guarantee of future returns” and noted that in shorter, recent periods, a Bitcoin-only strategy would have outperformed. Counterpoint: Why a Bitcoin-Only Strategy May Be Preferable Addressing the other side of the coin, Hougan discussed why many investors might prefer a Bitcoin-only strategy. This perspective is especially relevant for those concerned with macroeconomic issues like the degradation of fiat currencies and inflation. Hougan posited that Bitcoin’s dominant position and its community’s focus on becoming a new form of money make it likely to continue leading this space. “It has a large lead, and size matters in money,” he stated, supporting the idea that Bitcoin’s simplicity and focused use-case as digital gold could be more appealing for certain strategic investments. “Money is a massive market. There’s plenty of space for BTC to run if it succeeds. My view, in a word: If you want to make a broad bet on crypto and public blockchains, you should own multiple crypto assets. If you want to make a specific bet on a new form of digital money, buy Bitcoin,” Hougan concluded. At press time, ETH traded at $3,514.06.

Derivatives markets witnessed a massive 210% increase in FET’s trading volume, indicating renewed interest from traders. Additionally, short-sellers are facing significant liquidations, suggesting a short-term squeeze and a potential trend reversal in FET’s favor. Overbought Territory And User Apprehension However, not everyone is convinced of FET’s long-term prospects. The token’s meteoric rise has pushed its Relative Strength Index (RSI) to 75 on the 4-hour charts, which signifies that it might be entering overbought territory. This suggests a potential correction could be on the horizon, as investors who bought in early might be tempted to take profits. Moreover, user sentiment appears to be mixed. While social media discussions surrounding FET have reached levels not seen since March 2024, a significant portion of users on Binance, a leading crypto exchange, seem to be bearish on the token’s long-term future. This discrepancy highlights a potential disconnect between casual investors and more seasoned traders.

Demand for calls at $100K suggests traders preparing for a renewed rally into 2025, according to one trading firm.  Crypto options traders are strategically placing bets that diverge from the ongoing downtrend in bitcoin's {{BTC}} price.  In the past 24 hours, the leading cryptocurrency by market value has declined over 1% to $64,500, extending the pullback from recent highs near $72,000, CoinDesk data show.  Still, the flow in bitcoin options listed on leading exchange Deribit has been biased toward call options at levels (strikes) well above the cryptocurrency's going market rate, perhaps a sign sophisticated investors expect the ongoing price weakness to set the stage for a more extensive run higher.  In the options market, we observed an abnormally large buying flow of Dec and Mar [expiry] $90-$100K calls in the last 24 hours. We believe this suggests the market is calling the bottom and positioning itself for a sustained rally, possibly last into 2025,"" Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a market update.  A call option gives the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset, BTC, at a predetermined price at a later date. A call buyer is implicitly bullish on the market.  The chart shows the most active bitcoin options on Deribit over the past 24 hours. The activity has been mostly concentrated in June expiry calls at $65,000, $68,000, and $70,000, July expiry call at $110,000 and December expiry call at $95,000.  The divergence in options market sentiment and bitcoin's price is more strongly evident in the call-put skew, which indicates what traders are willing to pay to acquire an asymmetric payout in the upward or downward direction.  Per Amberdata, the one-, two-, three-, and six-month skews have held consistently positive through the recent BTC price pullback, suggesting a bias for calls or upside. Only the seven-day skew has flipped negative, signaling demand for downside protection.  Bitcoin has decoupled from Nasdaq's uptrend in recent weeks, largely due to long-term holders and miners selling coins and growing chatter about the non-directional nature of the ETF inflows.

Recently trading at $65,715, Bitcoin’s small increase of nearly a percent in the last 24 hours has sparked some cautious optimism among crypto fans around the world. This newfound confidence is boosted by big whale activity and positive long-term predictions from top analysts. Related Reading: 87% Of Bitcoin Hodlers Laughing All The Way To The Bank – Here’s Why Big Investor Buys $395M Worth of Bitcoin A well-known crypto whale has made headlines by buying 6,070 BTC, worth about $395 million. This is the whale’s first big purchase in over 18 months. Known for smart trading moves, this investor previously bought 41,000 BTC during the 2022 market dip at an average price of $19,000 per BTC. In a brilliant move, the whale sold 37,000 BTC during the market upswing in 2023 and 2024 at an average price of $46,800, making a huge $1.74 billion in proceeds and over $1 billion in profit. This latest purchase shows the whale’s renewed faith in Bitcoin’s future, hinting at big price movements ahead. Analysts Predict Bitcoin Could Reach $100,000 Top crypto analysts are very optimistic about Bitcoin’s future, with some predicting it could hit $100,000. Ali Martinez, a respected crypto expert, points out that over 70% of all open Bitcoin positions on Binance are bullish. 70.27% of all accounts in @binance with an open #Bitcoin position are going long! pic.twitter.com/PiGZp0rP58 — Ali (@ali_charts) June 19, 2024 Another analyst, who goes by the name Jelle, notes that Bitcoin has recently hit important support levels, like the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and the lower edge of an ascending triangle pattern. Jelle believes a bounce from these levels could push Bitcoin to $72,000 soon, paving the way for a potential rise to $100,000 in the long run. These predictions are in line with a broader optimistic view, as many believe Bitcoin’s current price is a good buying opportunity. More Bullish Signs On The Horizon Bitcoin’s recent price movement isn’t just drawing in individual investors. More big institutional investors are showing interest, which shows growing confidence in Bitcoin’s value. Large investments from well-known figures and companies signal wider acceptance and integration of Bitcoin into mainstream finance. Related Reading: Whales Dump Over $1 Billion In Bitcoin: Fire Sale Or Foreshadowing? Meanwhile, Bitcoin price prediction for July is bullish, indicating a potential 30% rise to over $85,000, according to crypto price tracker CoinCodex. This is despite current technical indicators leaning bearish. This suggests a potential disconnect between market sentiment and price action. The Fear & Greed Index at 60 (Greed) further highlights this dissonance. While the price has seen nearly half bullish days (47%) over the past month with relatively low volatility (2.29%), underlying technicals may be pointing to a different story. It will be interesting to see if the predicted price increase comes to fruition or if the bearish undercurrents prevail. Investors are closely watching Bitcoin’s price movements, looking for opportunities that could signal new highs. Although the path to $100,000 is full of uncertainty, the strategic insights from market veterans and increasing institutional interest provide a solid foundation for Bitcoin’s long-term potential.

The discovery has raised concerns regarding the founder’s choice to flee prosecution by seeking refuge in the same nation. The founder of Terraform Labs, Do Kwon, was detained in Montenegro in March 2023 and is currently facing extradition demands from the US and South Korea. Opposition Calls For Resignation According to Bloomberg, Milojko Spajic has claimed that the investment was made by Singapore-based company Das Capital SG, in which he was a partner. However, the independent Montenegrin newspaper Vijesti, which broke the news, reported that the holdings grew to nearly $90 million at one point. Spajic’s LinkedIn profile shows that he worked as a credit analyst and investor in Singapore from 2014 to 2020 before returning to Montenegro to serve as finance minister in late 2020. Related Reading: MicroStrategy Buys Additional 11,930 BTC, Fibonacci Analysis Hints At $160K Bitcoin Price Peak The revelations surrounding the prime minister’s investment have emerged at a critical time for Montenegro, where Spajic has led a “fragile” ruling coalition since October. As a NATO member and European Union candidate country, the controversy surrounding the prime minister’s involvement in a collapsed crypto firm has increased pressure from the opposition, who now demand Spajic’s resignation. Terraform Labs Lawsuit Exposes Prime Minister’s Investment The prime minister’s investment details came to light in a lawsuit filed by the US Securities and Exchange Commission against Terraform Labs and Do Kwon. Kwon, the founder of the crypto firm, is facing prosecution linked to the $40 billion collapse of the TerraUSD stablecoin in 2022. In April, a civil trial in New York found the bankrupt company and Kwon personally liable for fraud, resulting in Terraform agreeing to pay $4.5 billion to settle the case with the SEC. Related Reading: Cardano And XRP Shorting Activity Could Act As ‘Rocket Fuel’ For A Rally; Santiment In light of these developments, Terraform CEO Chris Armani recently announced the complete dissolution of the company’s operations via a social media post on X (formerly Twitter). While expressing disappointment in the lawsuit’s outcome, Armani confirmed that TFL would cease operations and transfer ownership of the chain to the community. On the other hand, Kwon has already served his local sentence in Montenegro after being detained using a fake passport. The justice minister of Montenegro favors sending Kwon to the US, while the courts support his extradition to South Korea. With multiple rulings, Kwon’s fate now lies in the hands of the High Court.

Omnichain interoperability protocol LayerZero recently announced its ZRO Token launch alongside an Airdrop for its community. Related Reading: Trump-Inspired Memecoins Crash 30% After Rumors Of Trump’s Official Token Launch However, investors were shocked when the protocol announced the new ‘Proof-of-Donation’ mechanism. The token’s price has dropped over 20% after launching. LayerZero Faces Backlash For Token Airdrop On June 14, the LayerZero Foundation took X to tease an upcoming airdrop. That day, Bryan Pellegrino, the co-founder and CEO of LayerZero Labs, shared the key details of the airdrop. The CEO revealed a 1 billion ZRO tokens supply and the community would directly receive 23.8% of them. He explained that 8.5% of the community-allocated tokens would be distributed on the first day, while the rest would be given throughout the following 36 months. In May, the protocol announced its anti-Sybil measures for the upcoming token distribution. The measures include a self-reporting system for Sybil accounts, which offered 15% of the intended allocation to the addresses that report itself. Additionally, LayerZero created a bounty hunter program. Despite this, the protocol received some backlash for its distribution. Some users believe an 8.5% distribution on the first day was too low. Others felt like their allocated tokens didn’t match their transaction volume. An x user shared he received 39.28 ZRO despite being among the top 0.13% LazerZero users. As a result, many compared the ZRO airdrop to zkSync’s one. Last week, the crypto community slammed Ethereum’s Zero-Knowledge Layer-2 scaling solution zkSync ahead of its ZK token airdrop. At the time, investors expressed frustration with the token allocation and lack of anti-Sybil filtering. From Hero To ZRO? Despite the comparison to zkSync, it wasn’t until Thursday that the backlash intensified. Before the airdrop, LayerZero Foundation announced its new claiming mechanism, ‘ Proof-of-Donation.’ Per the post, users must donate $0.1 in USDC, USDT, or ETH per token to claim their ZRO allocation. The donations will go directly to the Protocol Guild, a collective funding mechanism for Ethereum developers. LayerZero Foundation estimated that the new mechanism will generate up to $18.5 million in donations. Additionally, it offered to match all donations up to $10 million. The protocol’s community quickly expressed their disagreement with the news. One user called it a “Pay to Claim” airdrop, stating that “if there was a ‘milking your users’ Olympics, LayerZero would take the gold.” Another user found the timing disingenuous, as the announcement was made soon before the airdrop. Many investors saw the “mandatory” nature of the donation as a slap in the face. Moreover, some consider the new claiming mechanism a “tax” instead of a donation. Related Reading: Curve (CRV) Bounces 40% From All-Time Low As Whales Go On Shopping Spree Pellegrino addressed the criticism of X, stating that nobody is forced to donate. He added that users are not entitled to the tokens: If you don’t want to donate… simply don’t claim. This is not something you own, it’s something being offered. As of this writing, ZRO has gone from $4.79 to $3.39, representing a 22% drop in four hours.

Market Trends Suggest A Shift To Substance,"In a market that has long been captivated by the rapid rise and often speculative nature of meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB) and PEPE, a notable shift is underway. According to Ki Young Ju, the CEO of CryptoQuant, the once-dominant meme coins are witnessing a decline in market influence, potentially signaling a maturing cryptocurrency landscape. Related Reading: Trump-Inspired Memecoins Crash 30% After Rumors Of Trump’s Official Token Launch The Decline of Meme Coins Dominance Ki Young Ju’s analysis reveals a significant reduction in the dominance of meme coins within the altcoin sector, a trend observed from recent market data. This change suggests a shift from speculative investments towards projects with more substantial fundamentals, akin to earlier phases in the development of the crypto market. “The era of meme coin speculation is winding down,” Ju states, emphasizing a return to fundamental analysis as a key driver for investment decisions. Memecoin dominance in alt markets is declining. CT would be shifting from gambling to focusing on fundamentals, similar to a few years ago. Pack it up lads, it’s over. pic.twitter.com/H5d81mRIJB — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) June 19, 2024 This observation is seen as a reflection of a broader movement away from high-risk gambles in digital assets. Meanwhile, as meme coins may be experiencing a downturn, Ju maintains a positive outlook on more fundamentally sound assets like Bitcoin. The CryptoQuant CEO particularly noted: Some people misunderstood my tweet. I’m bearish on memecoins, not BTC. Long-term bullish on Bitcoin. Market Response And Future Outlook The current market dynamics further illustrate this shift. So far, the top meme coins have declined over the past week. Particularly, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and PEPE have all experienced a week-long downturn, with declines of 13.1%, 14.1%, and 7.9%, respectively. This trend continued over the past 24 hours, with Dogecoin dropping an additional 0.3%, Shiba Inu 1.8%, and PEPE 4%. However, despite these decreases, IntoTheBlock data shows a silver lining, as a large proportion of holders for these meme coins remain profitable—74.99% for Dogecoin, 80.57% for PEPE, and 76.85% for FLOKI holders. In contrast to the recent downturns, analyst Moustache remains optimistic about the potential for altcoins in the coming year. He parallels current chart patterns and previous bullish years like 2020 and 2017. #Altcoins There are some massive signs that Altcoins will rise exponentially in 2024. -The chart looks like it did in 2020, or even 2017. -The 2W Gaussian Channel has changed from red to green.

Here’s how Dogecoin, Bitcoin, and other top coins compare. PEPE Is Among The Coins With The Highest Profitability Ratio Right Now In a new post on X, the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock has shared a chart that shows how the various top cryptocurrencies compare against each other regarding the percentage of holders carrying a net unrealized profit currently. The analytics firm has determined these percentages using on-chain data; the transaction history of each address on a given network can reveal at what price it received and how many coins it received, based on which an average cost basis can be calculated. Related Reading: IntoTheBlock Reveals Fact About Current Bitcoin Situation Analysts Are Puzzled By Naturally, the addresses or holders with this cost basis below the current spot price are in the green. They would contribute towards the holders in profit metric for the blockchain. Now, here is the chart posted by IntoTheBlock, which shows how this metric is looking at the moment for various assets in the sector: As is visible above, Bitcoin (BTC) currently has the highest profitability ratio among the top coins, with more than 89% of its holders carrying gains. Ethereum (ETH), the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is also second on this list, with over 83% of the addresses in the green. The gap between these two isn’t much right now, and the analytics firm thinks the Ethereum spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could push the asset to reach new highs. The third cryptocurrency on the list is Tron (TRX), with around 82% of investors in profit. Interestingly, two memecoins make up for the rest of the top 5, but none are Dogecoin (DOGE), the original and largest meme-based token. The two memecoins in question are Pepe (PEPE) and Floki (FLOKI), with around 80% and 77% holders above water, respectively. DOGE is further down the list, with the metric at 75%. Related Reading: Dogecoin, Cardano “Very Bullish” Based On MVRV: Santiment IntoTheBlock notes that this indicator data implies profitability is currently skewed towards large-caps and memecoins, with other altcoins waiting for breakthroughs. Now, what’s the significance behind holders in profit for any cryptocurrency? Generally, the investors holding gains are more likely to sell their coins. As such, the probability of a mass selloff increases as more holders come into profits. Because of this, corrections can become more probable when the percentage of addresses in the green increases. In this view, the top coins with lower profitability, like Dogecoin or Pepe, may have more room to run before hitting a wall than an asset like Bitcoin. PEPE Price Pepe is trading around $0.00001126 at the time of writing, down more than 8% in the last seven days.

Based on his analysis, the foremost meme coin could soon enjoy a god candle, sending its price to unprecedented heights. Dogecoin’s Massive Rally Will Send It To $7.5 Trader Tardigrade predicted in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Dogecoin will rise to as high as $7.5 when it makes its “huge surge.” He made this prediction while revealing that the meme coin had formed a triangle consolidation, which is the last phase of consolidation before Dogecoin made that massive move to the upside. Related Reading: Cardano Bucks Bears As Large Transactions Climb To $10 Billion, Can This Drive Price To $1? The crypto analyst also revealed that these triangle consolidations have formed in every market cycle and usually occur just before Dogecoin enjoys a parabolic rally. Trader Tardigrade has been bullish on DOGE for a while now and has continued to lay out bullish narratives for the meme coin. In one of his previous X posts, he highlighted a ladle pattern, which he claimed has always formed for the meme coin in every cycle. He mentioned that “the bowl” was ready and was almost time for the shaft. The chart he shared showed that Dogecoin could rise above $2 once the shaft had formed. In another post, Trader Tardigrade highlighted a parallel channel that Dogecoin usually follows. He then claimed that the meme coin’s next move would be “huge” while revealing that DOGE had left the lower support line of the current channel. Based on the chart he shared, Dogecoin could rise to $12 when that move happens. Meanwhile, Trader Tardigrade isn’t the only analyst who has alluded to Dogecoin’s historical patterns to predict the meme coin’s future trajectory. Crypto analyst Javon Marks recently predicted that Dogecoin could rise to as high as $17 based on its historical breakout trend, in which the meme coin always enjoys a larger run in every subsequent bull run. Dogecoin Current Outlook Despite the bullish predictions made by these analysts, Dogecoin seems to have a bearish sentiment around it at the moment. Crypto analyst Kevin (formerly Yomi OG) revealed that DOGE has lost all of its daily moving averages, which he noted is a “very bad sign” for Dogecoin in the short to medium term if it cannot reclaim these moving averages. Related Reading: Analyst Says XRP Price Is Long Overdue For Bullish Wave, Here’s The Target The crypto analyst added that Dogecoin had made a lacklustre bounce after tapping the golden pocket down at $0.11. For now, he claimed that the point of interest is Dogecoin climbing above $0.132 and that it would need to hold above the range between $0.10 and $0.11 should the meme coin go lower. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at around $0.12, down in th last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.
