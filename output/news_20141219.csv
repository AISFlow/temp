42398100,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbMA2J,1419022978,Brazilian Senate Report: Bitcoin Isn't Ready for Regulation,"A new study commissioned for the Federal Senate of Brazil has sought to examine how the spread of bitcoin and other digital currencies could impact Brazil's economy, and whether formal regulation is necessary for the domestic industry.  Authored by Cesar Rodrigues van der Laan, a consultant to Banco Central do Brasil, the 18-page document concludes that Brazil should not immediately regulate bitcoin, arguing that there is not enough activity in local markets to warrant such rulemaking.  The paper goes on to highlight the varied response regulators have taken to bitcoin around the world, citing the stance taken by Russia, which has taken active steps to ban bitcoin, and the US, where state regulators are seeking to establish a framework for the industry.  Notably, the paper advocates that Brazil follow a similar path to the US, if and when it decides to introduce regulation for the industry:  ""The US tax authorities [have] determined that virtual currency is an asset that must be declared and is subject to tax. In turn, the US Treasury has determined that significant transactions in bitcoins are reported to the authorities, as common currencies. Brazil should follow similar path, but only in case of further spread of this new financial asset.""  Local entrepreneurs expressed optimism that the document, while not bullish on bitcoin's ability to compete against Brazil's national currency, would help further discussion regarding the potential benefits the technology offers in one of Latin America's largest economies.  ""The Senate report encourages me to think regulators here are willing to understand these new technologies, they see it is relevant from a technological point of view and maybe it will be relevant from a financial point of view,"" Rafael Olaio, co-founder of local Ripple gateway Rippex, told CoinDesk.  The statement marks the third time a major authority in Brazil has issued a statement on bitcoin this year, following Banco Central do Brasil's warning in February and an April decision by the Receita Federal, the country's tax authority, that it would treat digital currencies as financial assets.  Bitcoin-based economy unlikely  Though touching on potential regulatory approaches, Van der Laan spends much of the paper theorizing about how a larger bitcoin ecosystem could affect the Brazilian economy.  The report opens with the context that global media outlets are increasingly interested in bitcoin as an alternative monetary system. However, it finds that bitcoin's furture for this purpose is unlikely given that it could lead to increased money laundering, it has a relatively new market and the fact that a significant number of local settlements are made in cash.  ""Given their limited current range, especially in Brazil, we do not see systemic risk to the operation of the domestic economy,"" the report reads.  The paper goes on to state the while created to circumvent the financial system, it would be beneficial for the technology's users and investors to focus instead on its potential to reduce the cost of payments and online commerce.  Financial crisis concerns  Overall, the paper suggests that bitcoin may hold the most long-term promise as a cross-border payment system, though one that would require a regulatory framework at a later date.  In particular, the paper argues that a large movement to an unregulated market could have potentially negative influence on the market, one that should not be permitted due to the recent 2008-2009 financial crisis.  The report states:  ""If there were lessons of the recent financial crisis is the consensus that globalized financial systems need more and not less regulation. For these reasons, it is difficult to consider plausible the hypothesis sovereign currencies be replaced by unregulated virtual currencies and without legal support.""  However, the report concludes that whether bitcoin and similar technologies can provide any innovations in payments ""remains to be seen"".  ""It will be adoption that will determine the real competitive potential of these new financial services,"" the report adds.  Start of dialogue  Local reactions to the report ranged from dismissive of its lack of impact on business to positive.  Andre Horta, CEO at bitcoin exchange startup BitcoinToYou.com, was enthusiastic about the report release, though he questioned whether a regulatory framework would not benefit local entrepreneurs like himself.  ""Regulation can be good, because more people and companies would have greater security to use bitcoin to send money to another country without violating the current law. More than this, venture capitals firms and investor are waiting for official regulation of bitcoin to invest capital in bitcoin startups in Brazil,"" he argued.  Rippex  's Olaio chose to focus on the more macro findings of the report, agreeing in particular that bitcoin will have a hard time competing with Brazil's native currency, the real.  ""Volatility is the biggest hurdle for bitcoin's adoption as a currency. Today, its compared to gold, but the regular citizen never uses gold as an everyday currency,"" he said.  Horta, however, believes that the paper might have the most value as a way for the local ecosystem to start a dialogue with regulators, concluding:  ""It will be wonderful if they open his door to discuss about bitcoin with the bitcoin community, to see that the bitcoin can be great, to reduce bureaucracy and reduce the costs to make money transfer, to make payments over internet or physically.""

42398097,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbMA1K,1419015734,Hedgeable Offers 'Free Bitcoin to Every American' in Investor Promotion,"Hedgeable has announced an ambitious plan to give one free bitcoin to every interested investor who enrolls in its Plus Program, a promotion the company emphasizes is available to ""every person in America"".  Founded in 2009, the VC-backed asset management startup aims to ""democratize"" access to advanced investing platforms, bringing exposure to new and potentially lucrative asset classes like bitcoin to those who it considers everyday investors.  Hedgeable  CEO and co-founder Michael Kane sought to frame the somewhat exaggerated announcement as one that best expresses its core vision: that every American should have access to potentially high-reward asset classes such as bitcoin.  Kane told CoinDesk:  ""We want everyone in America to own bitcoin as they do dollars, so we're talking to people who don't own bitcoin now but want it. There are millions of people who read about this, think this is very innovative, but there's no one that holds their hand to help them do this.""  Kane indicated that while high net-worth individuals currently have access to bitcoin through hedge funds, family offices and other outlets, it is seeking to bring exposure to this asset class down market, to those who might consider it alongside a more traditional investment vehicle such as an IRA or 401(k).  The promotion is part of a multi-stage rollout of bitcoin services at the company, which has integrated its platform with bitcoin services provider Coinbase.  The company's Plus Programhttps://www.hedgeable.com/investing requires a minimum $25,000 investment, and associated fees can be paid with bitcoin. Bitcoin investments are currently not available with its $5,000 basic investment program.  375 million investors  Throughout the conversation, Kane stressed that, while its account may require a sizable upfront investment, its target market is average investors, those who have between $50,000–$200,000 to invest.  ""The average client with us has $250,000, that's actually the average account size in America. However, if you have $200,000, you're really in the dark, most high-quality investment solutions are $250,000 and up,"" he said.  While bullish on the industry, Hedgeable acknowledges the risk associated with bitcoin in its available materialshttps://www.hedgeable.com/marketing/virtual_hedge.pdf, though it suggests its expertise can reduce any potential downside.  In spite of this, however, Kane believes that bitcoin could be a beneficial addition to the portfolio of Hedgeable's clients, providing a valuable hedge given the risks he sees inherent in investments overly focused on US dollars.  ""There are 375 million investors in the US and all of their holdings are in US dollars. This is the only country in the world where that's the case,"" Kane said.  Focus on education  Kane stressed that while Hedgeable wants to provide convenience to its clients, the startup also plans to offer education to those who want to learn about bitcoin before allocating some of their holdings to the investment.  Key to this mission will be increasing the exposure it provides to clients who express an interest in bitcoin, something it plans to do in ways that go beyond simply providing educational materials.  ""We'll be launching a bitcoin center in January, so that will be retail investor focused,"" Kane said. ""That's really what we're about, democratizing, educating.""  As for how the company will pay for any new bitcoin it purchases, Kane suggested that both company earnings and its VC investments could be used toward the promotion.  ""There's no issue for us,"" he said. ""If there's 1,000 people, we have no issue in funding that.""

42398072,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbG47Q,1419003007,Bitcoin Comic Goes on Sale Following Successful Crowdfunding,"Following a successful crowdsale, the English version of crypto-focused comic book Bitcoin: The Hunt for Satoshi Nakamoto has now gone on sale.  The book, which was launched at CoinSummit in London back in July, was created by Alex Preukschat and Josep Busquet, and features illustrations by José Ángel García Ares.    According to the authors, the comic weaves together the action, facts and fictions of bitcoin technology and its ""anarchic cypherpunk culture"". The mystery of Satoshi Nakamoto, the supposed pseudonym of the anonymous creator of bitcoin, provides a vehicle for ""a wild adventure through an underground filled with criminals, hackers and spooks"".    The Spanish version of the comic is already on sale across Spain through the FNAC bookstore chain, but as of yesterday it is available in English and Spanish in digital form via distribution platform Comixology.com. The ebook costs $9.99.  An English language paper book will also be available in the near future, as will a Polish language version.  Bitcoin: The Hunt for Satoshi Nakamoto is published by Dibbuks, which also accepts bitcoin for its products.  Spreading awareness of bitcoin  Preukschat says that the crowdsale for the English language book, held on the Swarm fundraising platform, was a success, reaching people in roughly 30 countries around the world and raising an estimated $20,000.  ""The crowd sale went really well. We had an objective of 40 bitcoins and reached 64 in total,"" said Preukschat. ""It was very much a community driven project because almost 200 people supported it.""  The most generous contributors were rewarded with cameo appearances in the book, he added.  Several bitcoin businesses, including Bitstamp, Coinbase, Chain and Xapo, also helped with the fundraising.  Preukschat told CoinDesk that the support from the bitcoin community had been amazing and that the response to the book had already been very positive.  He said:  “We have already noticed that people that didn't know about bitcoin are getting interested in Spain. We hope this will increase in the coming months around the world. Our goal now is to keep on finding new publishers for localized editions around the world with the support of local bitcoin communities""  ""Since the hard work of creating the story is done it will be quite cheap for local publishers to translate and then print or create a digital edition,"" he added.

42398062,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbG3wb,1418969006,Singapore Exchange CoinHako Gets Personal Investment Boost from Tim Draper,"Recently launched Singapore exchange and wallet service CoinHako has received a helping hand via a ""six figure"" personal investment from venture capitalist Tim Draper.  The company is also actively in talks with other angel investors and seed-stage VCs to close another round of funding.  Draper said that, while bitcoin is the greatest technological breakthrough since the Internet, liquidity and pricing remained a problem in Singapore and Southeast Asia.  ""CoinHako is cleverly filling up those gaps. Singapore is also one of the most competitive places in the world to do business.""  Founders Yusho Liu and Gerry Eng have just returned home to Singapore, fresh from participating in 'Tribe 4' of Draper's son Adam's Boost VC accelerator program. Boost VC recently declared it would 'go full bitcoin' for its next and fifth round, working only with companies in the digital currency space.  Addressing regional issues  CoinHako  bills itself as ""the simplest way to start using bitcoin in Singapore"", with a site available in English, Chinese and Japanese. Users may create a standalone wallet account or log in with Facebook, and the trading fee is 1.9%.  Liu told CoinDesk the company has plenty of feedback and data to show what regional problems needed solving as a priority.  He said:  ""Liquidity is low in Southeast Asia. Order books are thin and pricing is unfavourable. Most end up going to ATMs and offline brokers and get charged exorbitant fees. With our technology, consumers are now able to purchase coins at the most competitive pricing, without even having to get out of their seats.""  CoinHako emphasizes simplicity, he added, describing the concept also as bitcoin's biggest challenge.  Liu said the company is trying to pick up market share in Singapore to establish itself as a mainstay, focusing exclusively on the city-state's market for the time being.  The team is, however, developing a platform to take on customers from the rest of the region ""in the next couple of months"".  Current bitcoin situation in Singapore  Despite showing early promise as a regulatory and financially savvy haven for bitcoin startups, Singapore currently is not headquarters to any household-name international bitcoin company . It is, however, a popular jurisdiction in which to register other Asia-focused businesses. OKCoin and Quoine, and the regional office of itBit have all done so.  Liu said he still has confidence in the future, despite the challenges:  ""The bitcoin ecosystem in Singapore is pretty robust. I think all of [the startups] are doing a great job managing their vertical. However, I’m afraid some verticals are pre-mature for the current market.""  Entrepreneurial pedigree  Liu says he is ""a serial entrepreneur with a mechanical engineering background"". He and Eng met at Singapore's Officer Cadet School about six years ago, during their period of compulsory military service.  Eng has also previously been lead engineer at two other startups.  The experience of immersing themselves in the heart of bitcoin action with Boost VC for three months, together with ""50 other like-minded fanatics"" was invaluable, he said, explaining:  ""Not only did we get access to Boost’s unimaginable network, we also forged great friendships that will last a lifetime. Boost also provided excellent facilities, which was a huge plus point for international teams like us. We would totally do it again.""  Tim Draper and bitcoin  Draper, a well-known bitcoin proponent, is a founding partner at leading venture capital firms Draper Fisher Jurvetson FJ and Draper Associates. He was also previously a member of Singapore Economic Development Board's International Advisory Council.  His past investments include Skype, Hotmail, Baidu and Twitch, as well as digital currency startups Vaurum (since rebranded Mirror), snapCard and CrowdCurity.  He garnered significant attention in the wider bitcoin sphere in July, when he placed the winning bid for the US Marshals Service's auction of 29,656 BTC seized from the Silk Road dark marketplace.  He later won one 2,000 BTC block of a subsequent US Marshals bitcoin auction – this time of coins confiscated from accused Silk Road proprietor Ross Ulbricht.  Draper has said he would use all the coins acquired either to invest in further bitcoin startups, or to shore up his exchanges' liquidity.
