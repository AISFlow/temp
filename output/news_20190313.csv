42381689,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9oEfH,1552518604,"A Blockchain to Connect All Blockchains, Cosmos Is Officially Live","Cosmos, a highly anticipated blockchain itself designed to improve the interoperability between any number of other blockchains, has officially released a live software.  With the mining of its first block at 23:00 UTC, the project has launched Cosmos Hub, the first in a series of proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains that will be created in the Cosmos ecosystem.  At present, users of the network will not be able to swap tokens between blockchains or otherwise connect to Cosmos Hub with existing blockchain networks until validators officially vote to activate what is called the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol.  The first phase of today’s Cosmos network launch comes after nearly three years of planning and development. Having debuted the concept for the blockchain interoperability platform back in summer 2016, Cosmos later raised over $16 million in an initial coin offering (ICO) in 2017.  Since then, Tendermint Inc. – a for-profit entity behind the core technology of the Cosmos network – has been releasing preliminary developer-focused products.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Tendermint Inc director Zaki Manian explained:  “We want to take the blockchain development cycle from idea to implementation down from years to months. This is how we’re trying to transform the blockchain space.""  As such, Manian said that the Cosmos Software Development Kit (SDK), which debuted back in February 2018, is already being used by high-profile crypto companies such as the Binancehttps://binance-chain.github.io/acknowledgement.html exchange.  In addition, Tendermint Core – the blockchain networking and consensus mechanism underlying the Cosmos Hub – is another key tool that Manian envisions will help “fundamentally remove barriers to innovation” in the blockchain space and ultimately help “compose an entirely new system of finance.”  “Out of all these building blocks, [you’ll be able to compose] an entire … open system of finance that operates to scale and can be composed of individual, specialized chains that do different things,"" Manian said.  Unleashing validators  Today’s launch was a significant step toward that broader, expansive vision – one that Manian points out will “take years to fully manifest.” The main purpose of Cosmos Hub launch is to establish the broader ecosystem of validators, entities that stake tokens on the network, while Manian’s team continues to work toward cross-blockchain capabilities.  “In order to make this whole vision of connecting blockchains work, there needs to be a set of operators who have skin in the game to coordinate this blockchain network,” said Manian.  Normally, in a proof-of-work (PoW) system similar to bitcoin or ethereum, these validators are miners who compete for block rewards by operating computer servers and expending large amounts of electricity.  Validators in a PoS system, on the other hand, are “selected” by the system based on a separate metric of staked tokens in order to participate in block creation and transaction finalization.  “In proof-of-stake, the costs and rewards [of the system] are internal,” said Manian. “So, we had to come up with a very sophisticated system of distributing rewards, of distributing the speculator taxation system, of punishing people for malicious behavior, of punishing people for going offline.”  He added:  “All of it has to be internal to the system and that’s why proof-of-stake is such a significant engineering feat over proof-of-work.”  And while Cosmos participants successfully tested this system of validation with roughly 200 computer servers called nodes in a former dummy environment called Game of Stakes, there had never been real value at stake by participants before today.  “[Today’s launch] is about unleashing those live economic incentives and having value at risk for the first time and then letting this set of economic incentives that we’ve designed select who the [validators] are,” said Manian.  According to Manian, this is a crucial foundational step that Cosmos developers are cautious about getting right.  He told CoinDesk: “Building interoperability. Establishing mechanisms for workers of some kind to custody bitcoin or ether or ERC-20 assets and manifest synthetic versions of them in [the Cosmos] environment. If you don’t know who your validators are none of this is possible.”  Next steps  For now, Cosmos users are not allowed to transfer their holdings of the native network currency – ATOM tokens – just yet.  Since ATOM tokens are intended to act as “the collateral that people put at risk to be [validators] in the system” according to Manian, these tokens will be strictly used as the “mechanism for selecting membership into the system.”  But once both the system and the validator set are deemed to be in stable condition, token holders will vote on when to enable live ATOM transfers.  Thereafter, a secondary vote will be held to connect new blockchains also called “zones” to the Cosmos Hub and begin swapping heterogeneous cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).  “In these early days, we can expect to have issues, updates, and bugs,” the Interchain Foundation – a non-profit organization dedicated to support Cosmos network development – warned in a blog post, adding:  “The existing tools require advanced technical skills and involve risks which are outside of the control of the Interchain Foundation and/or the Tendermint team. … Please exercise extreme caution!”  Staking as a service  Manian told CoinDesk there are 70 validators at Cosmos Hub launch committed to securing the network. Some of these validators are focused on staking tokens as a service to wider ATOM holders.  In a sense, this is almost like leasing out crypto assets in order to earn returns and may encourage new users to flock to the Cosmos ecosystem.  Shayne Coplan, founder of the Union Marketplace for such service providers scheduled to launch in April, told CoinDesk that over the next few months a “cross-network layer of reputation” for these validators will emerge.  “If you look at these different staking service providers, a lot of them are performing on several networks at any given time,” Coplan said, referring to other staking networks such as Tezos and the Tendermint-based network Loom. “Now with Cosmos being another very valuable chain with staking and delegation, it’s going to place a major emphasis on cross-network reputation for validators.”  The rewards these stakers and holders gain are generally earned in the ATOM token but in future may also be earned in wrapped forms of alternative cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether.  While Union Marketplace has quietly collected around 230 validators across all its various staking networks as it gears up for launch, Coplan expects the Cosmos launch, in particular, will inspire more players to experiment with these types of services.  “There’s a huge range of people interested in these types of staking services, from retail investors to investment funds,” Hendrik Hofstadt, co-founder of the validator startup Certus One, told CoinDesk. “Quite a few larger funds have reached out to us.”  Plus, Certus One’s Telegram group for retail ATOM users signed on 60 members within the first 24 hours of opening, Hofstadt added.  Meanwhile, Joe Pindar, co-founder of the validator startup Block3, told CoinDesk this type of ecosystem opens up a new type of investment opportunity.  Speaking to how Cosmos rewards stakers on a continual basis, which he compared to income investing, Pindar added:  “You actually start getting revenue or income from those rewards and start to appreciate more and more ATOMs, which I think is a different investing model and I’m excited to see how that plays out.”  Leigh Cuen contributed reporting.

42381679,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9oESh,1552509012,"You Can Pre-Order This $15,000 Crypto-Powered Beer Vending Machine","Where there's a long line for beer today, there could one day be a Civic vending machine.  At its booth at SXSW Wednesday, the decentralized identity startup Civic was on hand to showcase three vending machines selling local staples – Shiner Bock and Austin Amber beer. The demo is a test for a product that Civic plans to roll out officially later this year: a $15,000 machine that can verify a user's age and accept payment via crypto. The units are currently available for pre-order.  ""We're merging identity and payment into one transaction,"" Civic's Titus Capilnean told CoinDesk.  Since opening for business last Sunday, Capilnean estimated that the machines sold about 150 beers per day for a total of roughly 100,000 CVC – or $7,600 – in sales.  Tokens from the sales were airdropped to SXSW attendees by the company itself.  Beers cost 200 CVC each, or about $12 at the start of the event, Capilnean said. iPhone users who downloaded the Civic Pay app and verified their identity received enough CVC to buy one round. Then after making a couple taps on the machine and selecting the desired cold one, the unit shows a QR code that the user scans with their app, and payment is made.  ""Basically, we built these and tested them here,"" Capilnean said of the SXSW demo. It was the first time Civic ran sales and identity verification at once with the general public.  Though all transactions made through the app are settled in crypto, the idea is that users can interact with it fairly easily, just as they would in fiat. Civic first demoed its ability to verify ages with Anheuser-Busch at Consensus 2018, but this year the startup has upped that functionality by enabling sales via a mobile app.  Regulatory buy-in  Technical issues weren't the only hurdle the company had to overcome.  ""We got the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission to be on board with this happening,"" Capilnean said. Once state regulators were convinced, SXSW organizers felt comfortable with the product, too.  The priority, Capilnean said, was somehow making sure that people under 21 weren't drinking. From the Beverage Commission's perspective, it didn't matter if humans or machines did the proper verification.  While not disclosing potential partners, Capilnean said Civic is already in talks with companies that might contract with Civic in places where alcohol distribution could be improved. To take pressure off servers, sporting events and bars, for example, might be places that could use vending machines to verify age.  Still, Capilnean said Civic believes music festivals are the most immediate opportunity.  Civic vending machines.

42381670,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9oEHN,1552506593,QuadrigaCX Widow: CEO Mixed Personal Funds with Crypto Exchange,"Gerald Cotten, the deceased founder and CEO of crypto exchange QuadrigaCX, used his own cash to make customers whole during a legal battle with a bank, his widow said.  Jennifer Robertson, Cotten's wife and executor of his estate, said in a statement sent to CoinDesk Wednesday that Cotten told her he was putting his own funds into the exchange after the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) froze its fiat holdings in 2018 over questions about their origin.  In the statement sent by law firm Stewart McKelvey, she said:  ""While I had no direct knowledge of how Gerry operated the business, he told me that he had been putting his own money back into QCX to fund user withdrawals in 2018 while the CIBC money remained frozen. I believe Gerry had the best interests of the business in mind, and cared for his customers.""  Roberston also said Stewart McKelvey would be withdrawing itself from representing the exchange moving forward after an unspecified conflict of interest was discovered by QuadrigaCX's court-appointed monitor Ernst & Young (EY).  In the statement, Robertson says:  ""I have been advised by Stewart McKelvey that, in light of concerns regarding a potential conflict of interest that have been raised as a result of information which has come to the attention of the Monitor since the start of the CCAA process, they have withdrawn from representing QuadrigaCX (QCX) and the other applicant companies in the CCAA process.""  The statement added that ""details of such information from the Monitor has not been disclosed to me.""  Missing funds  Quadriga filed for creditor protection at the end of January, claiming that after Cotten's death, it could no longer access nearly $140 million in cryptocurrencies and was unable to send funds to some 115,000 customers.  The Nova Scotia Supreme Court appointed EY as a monitor for the exchange, allowing EY to oversee and facilitate Quadriga's efforts to recoup some of its missing funds.  To date, EY has announced that, while it is making some progress in securing Quadriga's fiat holdings from various third-party payment processors, it has not yet been able to locate any more than a fractional amount of its crypto holdings.  Perhaps most notably, six bitcoin cold wallet addresses Quadriga said it used were empty, raising questions as to whether the exchange still has any of the missing cryptocurrencies at all.

42381676,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9oEOv,1552500003,Coinbase Completes First OTC Crypto Trade Directly From 'Cold' Storage,"Coinbase Custody has just completed its first over-the-counter (OTC) trade directly out of cold, or offline, storage.  Announcing the news in a blog post on Wednesday, the San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange said the trade occurred after its Custody service had been ""directly integrated"" with the OTC desk at Coinbase Pro.  The news, it said, was a ""major unlock"" for its clients as it marked the availability of ""immediate"" liquidity. Previously, a trader would have to withdraw assets from cold storage – where the private keys are kept on a device not connected to the internet – to a ""hot,"" or online, wallet at a trading platform in order to execute a trade. Market conditions can change quickly in the time it takes to do all this (24 to 48 hours just for the withdrawal part).  Connecting the two departments means clients can leverage the OTC desk without needing to move funds out of cold storage, according to the post. Clients ""can buy OTC and settle assets directly into Custody,"" Coinbase added. The integration came about due to client demand.  ""Being able to trade while their funds are held safely in cold storage is a feature that we've heard loud and clear that our customers want,"" said Sam McIngvale, CEO of Coinbase Custody Trust. ""Coinbase offers the world's largest regulated pool of crypto liquidity. Being able to access this market quickly and safely unlocks tremendous benefits for our customers.""  Faster trading  Indeed, several of Coinbase's competitors in custody and OTC trading have integrated the two functions recently, with the same goal: speeding up the settlement of trades to the standard institutional investors expect while keeping coins safe in cold storage.  For example, in January, market maker Genesis Trading partnered with custody specialist BitGo so that their mutual clients can trade without needing to remove coins from offline storage (a process that, as noted above, can take hours or even days).  Another OTC shop, OTCXN, has similar arrangements with custodians Kingdom Trust and Prime Trust.  Coinbase first launched its Custody service for institutions in May of last year and went live in June.  The exchange was later approved as a crypto custodian in New York state in October 2018, after the New York Department of Financial Services granted its application to create the Coinbase Custody Trust Company LLC offering custody services for bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ethereum, ethereum classic, litecoin and XRP.

A screenshot of the posting has been added to the article.    –––––––––    The New York Times, the second-largest newspaper in the U.S. by circulation and a storied institution in American journalism, is getting ready to experiment with blockchain technology for publishing.  According to a job posting that appeared on the Times' website Wednesday, the media organization is looking for someone to help ""design a blockchain-based proof of concept for news publishers.""  To start the project, NYT is looking for a ""forward-looking leader"" who would be working on the proof-of-concept's outline for 12 months within the company’s research and development division, according to the post, which was removed after this article was published.  The new hire ""will codify the vision for the research project and share that vision with potential stakeholders at other media organizations"" and ""help brand and create a public identity and assets for the project.""  Another goal will be to form a pool of the project's stakeholders and find advisors from news organizations, academia and social media companies.  Skill set  The candidate should have previous experience innovating in media organizations and ""leading a combination of engineers, designers, journalists"" for more than eight years, according to the NYT job posting. Strong skills in communication, writing and presentation, partnerships and collaborations are necessary.  The new blockchain leader should also have an ""established track record in real-world application of new technologies"" and ""a mixed skill set with some experience in at least three of: journalism, product, design, software development, hardware engineering, user research.""  No less important, the job requires ""a real passion for The New York Times’s mission.""  The NYT project wouldn't be the first blockchain-media experiment. The most prominent of these is Civil, a token-driven startup backed by the ethereum development studio ConsenSys.  In its editorial operations, the New York Times has been covering the blockchain and cryptocurrency agenda for several years now, including the special project ""Demystifying the Blockchain"" last June. The newspaper's lead reporter in blockchain and crypto, Nathaniel Popper, is also the author of the bestseller ""Digital Gold: Bitcoin and the Inside Story of the Misfits and Millionaires Trying to Reinvent Money.""

42381678,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9oERR,1552489210,Thailand's Securities Watchdog Approves Country's First ICO Portal,"Thailand's Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has given the green light to the country's first portal for scrutinized initial coin offerings (ICOs).  As reported by Bangkok Post on Wednesday, the decision was made by the SEC's board of directors and now needs final approval from other government bodies such as the Ministry of Commerce, according to the agency's director of fintech, Archari Suppiroj.  The portal is being developed to protect investors by scrutinizing ICOs and auditing their smart contracts, as well as countering financial crimes by ensuring sound know-your-customer processes.  Suppiroj further told the Post that around seven or eight firms had previously consulted with the SEC over operating the portal, and that an unnamed foreign firm had finally been approved.  The first ICO to be launched via the portal will be publicly offered in the ""near future"" under the royal decree on digital asset businesses, she said, adding that sales of security tokens (STOs) would be regulated separately under the Securities and Exchange Act and holders would need to apply for a license.  However, according to Suppiroj, the SEC is also planning to issue regulations that would allow firm to tokenize securities and other assets.  Last month, Thailand’s National Legislative Assembly approved an amendment to the Securities and Exchange Act legalizing the issuance of tokenized securities such as stocks and bonds from entities other than the Thailand Securities Depository.  ""The next step is for an issuer to offer security tokens in the primary market,"" Suppiroj told the news source.  Also in February, the SEC barred several cryptocurrencies from use in ICO investment and as a base in trading pairs.  Last July, the commission had said that only Thailand’s national currency, the baht, and seven cryptocurrencies could be used to invest in ICOs: bitcoin (BTC), bitcoin cash (BCH), ether (ETH), ether classic (ETC), litecoin (LTC), XRP and stellar (XLM).  The new ruling removed bitcoin cash, ether classic and litecoin from the list, although the reasons for the decision were not made clear at the time.

42381673,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9oEJt,1552486547,DTCC: Security Tokens Should Be Made to Meet Existing Regulatory Rules,"The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) has laid out guidelines for the post-trade processing of tokenized securities, aimed at market participants and regulators.  Policy arrangements for traditional market infrastructures – such as the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMIs) issued by global regulators – can provide clues to responsibilities that might be applicable to a security token platform providing post-trade services, said the DTCC in a white paper published today.  Put more plainly, the financial market infrastructure provider is calling for new entrants to play by the same rules it does. According to the white paper:  ""If a Security Token Platform performs the same or a substantially equivalent function as an existing market infrastructure, thus exposing investors and other market participants to the same type of risk, the legal and other requirements applicable to that function should be the same regardless of whether the function is being performed by an existing market infrastructure or as part of a Security Token Platform.""  The paper lays out several areas for consideration, such as ensuring that a platform for post-trade handling of crypto assets has an “enforceable legal basis,"" as well as an identifiable governance structure.  Also highlighted by the DTCC was the need for sound risk management of such platforms, clear and certain final settlement of assets, record keeping and “robust accounting practices, safekeeping procedures and internal controls.”  Mark Wetjen, managing director and head of global public policy at the DTCC, said that when most people think of markets and the trading of an asset, usually they are focused on what happens before or to the point of execution of a trade.  “But what occurs after a trade is executed is critically important and this issue has not been broadly discussed within the context of tokenized securities or crypto assets more generally,” he said in a statement.  Safety and soundness  Wetjen, who is also chairman of the board of DTCC's Deriv/SERV, said the framework DTCC has developed identifies the key issues that need to be addressed by those seeking to establish policy, rules or best practices to govern the conduct of entities providing post-trade services for crypto securities transactions.  “In our view, these issues are fundamental to protecting investors and establishing trust in the safety and soundness of security token platforms.”  No stranger to distributed ledger technology, DTCC began testing its DLT-based credit derivatives Trade Information Warehouse (TIW) in November with U.K.-based Barclays and 14 other unnamed banks. Testing is anticipated to be completed by the first quarter of 2019 with go-live scheduled thereafter.  But while that initiative is aimed at optimizing an existing business with the technology, Wednesday's report is about managing the risks of a new one created by it.  The timing of the report is also notable as it coincides with a warning on crypto assets from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, also issued Wednesday.  “Crypto-assets have exhibited a high degree of volatility and are considered an immature asset class given the lack of standardization and constant evolution, “ said the committee, which sets international standards for bank capital, liquidity and safety-and-soundness regulation.  “They present a number of risks for banks, including liquidity risk; credit risk; market risk; operational risk (including fraud and cyber risks); money laundering and terrorist financing risk; and legal and reputation risks.”  Image of DTCC Fintech Symposium 2017 via CoinDesk archives.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/03/13/dtcc-security-tokens-should-be-made-to-meet-existing-regulatory-rules,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d87d06b7b0bf00f1c872c8e4163d7dbfadc779f9-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42381675,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9oEMP,1552482015,US Treasury Sanctions Russian Bank Over Links to Venezuela’s Petro,"The U.S. Department of the Treasury has sanctioned a Moscow-based bank over its role in financing Venezuela’s controversial petro cryptocurrency.  The Treasury announced Monday that its Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has added Evrofinance Mosnarbank – which is jointly owned by Russian and Venezuelan state-owned firms – to the Specially Designated Nationals List, as it was the “primary” international bank that helped finance disputed Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro's “failed” petro project.  “Early investors in the Petro were invited to buy the cryptocurrency by wiring funds to a Venezuelan government account at Evrofinance,” the Treasury said, adding:  “Evrofinance’s involvement in the Petro demonstrated Maduro’s hope that the Petro would allow Venezuela to circumvent U.S. financial sanctions.”  The Treasury has also said that Evrofinance supported Venezuelan state-owned oil company Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PdVSA), which has “long been a vehicle for corruption, embezzlement, and money laundering by Maduro and his cronies.” The firm has also been on the U.S. sanctions list since January.  Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin said:  “The United States will take action against foreign financial institutions that sustain the illegitimate Maduro regime and contribute to the economic collapse and humanitarian crisis plaguing the people of Venezuela.”  In response to the Treasury's action, Evrofinance issued a statement on its website on Monday, stating that the bank “continues to operate in a stable manner,” and that it will “unconditionally fulfill all its obligations to customers and partners in full.”  With the addition of the bank to the SDN list, the Treasury said ""all property and interests in property of this entity, and of any entities that are owned, directly or indirectly, 50 percent or more by this entity, that are in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons are blocked and must be reported to OFAC.""

Announcing the news on Wednesday, CoinFLEX said that, with the new funding, the two firms have joined its previous backers, including Trading Technologies, Roger Ver and Dragonfly Capital Partners.  CoinFLEX is launching what it calls a ""global, scalable and secure crypto futures exchange"" that will offer physically-delivered bitcoin futures and, in future, a stablecoin-to-stablecoin futures contract.  Explaining the investment, Polychain CEO Olaf Carson-Wee said:  “As a physically-settled futures exchange, CoinFLEX will be well positioned to capture significant order flow from speculators, institutional traders and Proof of Work miners seeking to hedge against crypto price volatility and hash rate volatility.”  With physically-settled crypto futures, the contracts are settled with actual cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin. On the other hand, standard bitcoin futures contracts, for example those offered by major exchanges Cboe and CME Group, are settled in cash and not in actual bitcoin.  ""The development of a robust digital currency futures market is critical to the long-term sustainability of the asset class,"" said DCG's VP of investments, Travis Scher.  CoinFLEX has also launched its own token called FLEX Coin that it will use to reward traders for providing liquidity. The firm said it will pay traders in the token, based on the proportion of the volume they trade daily compared to the total daily volume on the platform.  Traders are then able to use the rewards to discount the fees charged for using the platform, CoinFLEX said.  CoinFLEX was first announced back in January when CoinfloorEX spun off from its parent company Coinfloor Group.  The parent company of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), is also building a platform to launch physically-settled bitcoin futures. The launch has been delayed several times, however, and is now expected sometime later this year.

42381687,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9oEe1,1552474809,Bitcoin Price Trapped in Key Make-or-Break Trading Range,"View  Bitcoin is trapped in a trading range defined by the 200-week simple moving average and the 200- week exponential moving average, currently at $3,404 and $4,106, respectively. Therefore, the outlook as per the weekly chart is neutral.  A weekly close (Sunday, UTC) above $4,106 would confirm a longer-term bearish-to-bullish trend change and could fuel a rally toward $5,000.  A weekly close (Sunday, UTC) below $3,404 could revive the sell-off from November highs above $6,500 and allow a drop to levels below $3,000.  The odds of a drop to the lower edge of the trading range would improve if BTC invalidates a bullish candlestick pattern created on Feb. 27 with a move below $3,658.  Bitcoin is trapped in a key trading range defined by the 200-week simple moving average and the 200- week exponential moving average, currently at $3,404 and $4,106, respectively  The cryptocurrency needs a break above the upper edge needed to confirm a longer-term bull reversal. Conversely, a move below the lower bound of the range could revive the bear market.  Prices fell below the 200-week EMA in the third week of November, bolstering the bearish view put forward by the high-volume breach of the crucial support at $6,000 on Nov. 14.  The ensuing sell-off, however, ran out of steam in mid-December with prices bouncing up from the SMA, then located near $3,100. Notably, that average has served as strong support at least three times in the last three months.  So far, however, seller exhaustion has failed to produce strong buying pressure, as is evident from bitcoin’s repeated failure to break above the EMA over the last 13 weeks.  With prices stuck between key MAs, bitcoin's immediate outlook as per the weekly chart is neutral. The crypto market leader is currently trading at $3,850 on Bitstamp, representing a 0.4 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.  Weekly chart  On the weekly chart, BTC witnessed corrective rally after defending the 200-week SMA support in mid-December and early February. However, on both occasions, the bounce failed to secure a close above the 200-week EMA.  With several weekly indicators now reporting early signs of bull reversal, the probability of bitcoin confirming a bearish-to-bullish trend change with a weekly close (Sunday, UTC) above the 200-week EMA at $4,106 appears high.  That could pave way for a bullish higher high above $4,236 (Dec. 24 high) and a rally toward $5,000.  Daily chart  The odds of BTC challenging the lower edge of the trading range would rise if prices find acceptance below $3,658, invalidating the bullish long-tailed doji candle created on Feb. 27.  A weekly close below the 200-week SMA at $3,404 could yield a sell-off to levels below $3,000.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

42381682,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9oEWT,1552473059,Don’t Count on Decentralization to Rule Crypto Out as Security: VanEck Exec,"After U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Jay Clayton backed a colleague’s analysis that tokens like ethereum may not be securities this week, panelists at the TOKEN2049 event are raising questions over one criteria suggested by the regulators.  Asked whether and how regulators have the power to define a threshold that William Hinman, SEC director of corporation finance, described last year as “sufficiently decentralized,” Gabor Gurbacs, Digital Asset director at VanEck, said he believes it doesn't make sense to say ""if something is sufficiently decentralized, it’s not a security.”  Gurbacs' firm has been closely working with regulators in the U.S. in its attempt to launch trading of the first bitcoin-based exchange-traded fund (ETF). He explained that, to a certain extent, even the traditional financial market could be seen as decentralized, such as the exchange-traded fund system or other capital market functions. ""But they all fall under the security law,"" he said.  Using the basis of being “sufficiently decentralized” to determine whether a crypto asset is a security was brought up by Hinman during a speech in June 2018, during which he said:  “If the network on which the token or coin is to function is sufficiently decentralized – where purchasers would no longer reasonably expect a person or group to carry out essential managerial or entrepreneurial efforts – the assets may not represent an investment contract.”  In a letter responding to Congressman Ted Budd and industry advocacy group Coin Center dated March 7, Clayton said he agreed with Hinman's analysis that found ethereum, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency, likely does not qualify as a security.  In the TOKEN2049 panel, Sandra Wu, founding partner of Hong Kong-based venture firm Origin X Capital, also weighed in, saying that while Hinman's comments explained a stance on projects that issue tokens as a centralized organization, it does not clearly explain the case for projects like ethereum where tokens were issued from an organization that, arguably, has grown more decentralized since.  She said:  ""What about everything in between (the two situations), where you have the birth of a network but it takes time (for the ownership of the tokens) to become sufficiently decentralized? The SEC has not given guidelines on everything in between.""  Gurbac also reiterated that the SEC has, in fact, still not given a formal ruling that ethereum is not a security, and that he doesn’t think there will be a decision soon. That's also a reason why his firm exclusively focuses on pushing an ETF with bitcoin as an underlying asset, which is treated as a commodity by the commission.  “Make no mistake the chairman of the SEC never said ethereum is not a security.

After the app update is released, users will receive an in-app notification to “Connect to Coinbase” to link the accounts if they so choose.  The account linking can be turned on or off at a later date from the Settings menu, the exchange said, adding that the feature would add convenience for Coinbase users that regularly transfer funds from their Coinbase.com account to a software or hardware wallet.  Coinbase is also planning a future update that will allow cryptocurrencies to be directly sent to users' Coinbase.com accounts from the app.  Coinbase has added a series of new features to the Wallet app lately.

42381684,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9oEaF,1552464036,It's Getting Harder to Send Bitcoin’s Lightning Torch – Here's Why,"An experiment pushing the boundaries of crypto payments, bitcoin's ""Lightning Torch"" has so far grown from a transaction worth a couple dollars to a global game whose users have included Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman.  But in the process of passing the Lightning Torch from one person to another, each recipient adding value each time, users have brought to light a lesser-known problem with the lightning network itself.  The problem is that when some users try to retrieve the torch, they find out they can't.  “#LNTrustChain was designed as a social experiment – but due to overwhelming success, it turned into a stress test of channel liquidity,"" tweeted pseudonymous bitcoin enthusiast ""BTChap"" alongside a “that escalated quickly” GIF.  This problem goes to the foundations of the lightning network: channels. To use lightning, you need to put money into a channel with another person. Some of the money sits on your side of the channel and some on the other side. Or all of it might be on your side or vice versa.  But say you're looking for money for your services. Or, in this example, you want the Lightning Torch. You need to have some money on the other side of the channel – called ""incoming liquidity"" that your counterparty can then push to you. The problem is that ""liquidity"" isn't necessarily going to be there.  “This concept is still not widely known and I think some people with big enough channels failed to receive the torch due to missing 'incoming' liquidity,” said ""Stadicus,"" a lightning developer known for putting together a popular guide for setting up bitcoin and lightning nodes on hobbyist computers.  It all sounds a bit odd and confusing, but the idea is that all these nitty-gritty details wouldn't be visible to the end-user once the network has more liquidity.  Educating effect  Still, that isn't changing the fact that today, the Lightning Torch is becoming too large for the network now that it contains $150.  ""Since the torch [has] became larger and larger, the number of channels providing sufficient liquidity became smaller and smaller,"" BTCChap told CoinDesk.  You can think of it in terms of a famous quote from sci-fi writer Arthur C. Clarke: ""Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.""  Lightning isn't quite at the ""magic"" stage yet. The inner-workings and springs are popping out all over the place. As such, some users have had to do a little extra work to pass on the torch. Some have split up their lightning payments into batches to get the full payment over to the person, Linux and lightning developer Rusty Russell told CoinDesk.  Then, going off of what Stadicus said earlier, some users need incoming capacity in order to accept payments. Some users have gone to recently-launched lightning products, such as Bitrefill's Thor, to tackle this problem.  Stadicus, when he ran into problems retrieving the torch (in the torch's very early days), got help from a friend on Twitter.  “I just set up my Lightning node a day before and the one incoming channel I had was big enough, but not well connected. So @meeDamian opened a channel to me and pushed the torch directly with that single bitcoin transaction to my lightning node,” Stadicus said.  But after that the payment was smooth.  “Coming back to your question about the liquidity, I think that it had quite an educating effect, also on the current limitations of the lightning network, and unfortunately pushed many people to custodial wallets like [Blue Walet], as this takes care of these kind of kinks,” Stadicus told CoinDesk.  That said, the creator of the torch, the pseudonymous ""Hodlonaut,"" is less certain it's had such a big impact.  ""Generally my impression is that most passes of the torch have worked with little issue, and that the slower pace of the torch is more due to other reasons,"" Hodlonaut said.  ""All in all [it's] a fun stress test for the lighting network, especially in routing payments bigger than just a few cents,"" Stadicus added.  A possible solution  Even long-time Bitcoin Core contributor Pieter Wuille joked about the liquidity ""problem,"" though in a tongue-in-cheek way, implying that fiat money doesn't have the same abilities as lightning.  In this way, some developers argue it’s expected that a network so small and new would have liquidity issues and that it will get easier as more money enters the network. Others think it could continue to be a problem in the long-term.  On the other hand, technologists argue that the lightning network isn’t exactly suited for larger payments anyway. Users can continue might continue to use regular, on-chain bitcoin transactions for that.  But developers are also working on technology that they hope will help with the problem – at least a little bit.  Right now, there are limits to lightning. Say you have three lightning ""channels"" open, each carrying 1,000 satoshis. You want to get 2,000 satoshi to someone. The technology so far won’t let you join two of your 1,000-satoshi channels together to form a 2000-satoshi payment. This limitation makes it much less practical to make larger payments over the lightning network.  But next-generation solutions like Atomic Multi-Path Payments (AMP) are in the works, and they’ve been added to the 1.1 specification roadmap, in part, because they've been highlighted by the Lightning Torch.  Russell concluded:  “[The torch] does show that AMP is definitely something we need already.”  Flare image via Shutterstock",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Alyssa Hertig,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/03/13/its-getting-harder-to-send-bitcoins-lightning-torch-heres-why,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/af05aa0228a823b2bb0429a2c4d145a71c4c219c-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42381681,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9oEVD,1552455016,"4 Crypto Assets Break Above Key Moving Average, Leaving Bitcoin Behind","Several well-known cryptocurrencies are trading above their 200-day moving averages, a development typically considered a sign of a healthy market.  A moving average (MA) is simply an ongoing calculation of the closing prices of an asset over a specified period of time, but is also a tool traders use to gauge the asset's trend direction as well as support and resistance levels.  While a moving average of any length can be used, the 200-day moving average is a standard in financial analysis. Put simply, an asset trading above the 200-day MA is considered bullish (likely to move higher), while one trading below it is considered bearish (likely to move lower).  Since the long-time market leader bitcoin is not currently trading above its 200-day moving average, one could be forgiven for assuming all other cryptocurrencies are following its footsteps.  However, that is not the case.  Signs of life emerge  Of the top 20 largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization as per CoinMarketCap, both the BTC and USD pairs of litecoin (LTC), binance coin (BNB), Tron (TRX) and Maker (MKR) are currently trading above their respective 200-day moving averages.  Both pairs trading above the moving average indicates the markets for LTC, BNB, TRX, and MKR are much stronger than those with acceptance above just one trading pair moving average or those with acceptance above neither – most of which fall under the latter category.  Indeed, the four cryptocurrencies have the most bullish markets, but as can be seen above, their performance is not yet the norm. Twelve of the top 20 cryptocurrencies have neither their BTC or USD trading pairs above the 200-day MA, and as the data below shows, several are still very far away.  Distances to the 200-day MA  Of the remaining top 20 cryptocurrencies by market cap that are not trading above their USD-denominated 200-day MA, bitcoin cash (BCH) is by a large margin the farthest away from achieving a healthy market while EOS is the closest.  According to data from CoinMarketCap, the price of BCH/USD would need to increase 124 percent in order to reach its 200-day moving average while EOS/USD would need to increase just 8 percent.  It's worth noting Bitcoin Cash underwent a hard fork in November resulting in the creation of two new cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin Cash ABC and Bitcoin SV. Bitcoin Cash ABC retained the BCH/USD ticker on most exchanges so its longtime price history may not be the best reflection of the current state of the Bitcoin Cash ABC market, given the fork has existed less than 200 days.  While it does express a weak market, an asset trading excessively far below its 200-day moving average is not always a negative indication. It can also be a sign of extreme oversold market conditions, similar to how the Mayer Multiple is used to gauge bitcoin's market conditions based on its relation to the 200-day MA.  With that in mind, the assets that are farthest from their respect 200-day moving averages like bitcoin cash and Zcash, which needs to increase 71 percent to reach its 200 day MA, could be seen as the most overdue for a positive correction.

Then, if they chose, they could have their balances converted into a ""synthetic"" version of ether, meaning they were exposed to the cryptocurrency's price movements but didn't actually hold the asset.  Now, Abra's non-custodial wallet will store the real thing.  “By adding native ether support, Abra users will now be able to easily buy and move ether from other wallets to the Abra app,"" said Abra CEO and founder Bill Barhydt in a press release. “This also opens up the potential to use ETH as an on-ramp to invest in the other assets listed on Abra.”  And it's not stopping with the ethereum blockchain's native token. Abra’s vice president of product, Willie Wang, said that “this is just the beginning,” adding:  “In the near future, we will offer native deposit and withdraw support for the other ERC-20 tokens currently listed on Abra, in addition to other new tokens that we will now be able to list.“  To entice ethereum fans to sign up, Abra is offering $25 worth of ether to new users who buy at least $5 of the cryptocurrency from its app. The special offer is good through March 31.  From gas to cash  Joseph Lubin, an ethereum co-founder and founder of the ethereum development studio ConsenSys, framed Abra's move as a sign of the network's evolution.  “While ether was intended to be the fuel that powers applications on the Ethereum platform, we are moving into a world where an enormous variety of tokens can start to be used on the payment side of a transaction,” Lubin said in Abra's press release.  Abra initially added support for ethereum (again, as a derivative) back in November 2017. The firm was also looking to strengthen its wallet app’s storage capability, allowing users to hold multiple currencies at a given time.  Just last month, Abra also announced it would allow users to buy fractions of traditional investment instruments such as stocks and exchange-traded funds (in synthetic form as well) through its blockchain-based app.  Bill Barhydt image via CoinDesk archives",POSITIVE,BCH | ETH | LTC,BCH | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | LTC | SPONSORED,Yogita Khatri,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/03/13/abra-crypto-wallet-now-stores-real-ether-not-just-synthetic-version,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4625440b29b708e8044102cb7d9b6363965bfbe8-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
