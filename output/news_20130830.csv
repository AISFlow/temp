42425067,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHqIdh,1377869386,"Tradehill halts bitcoin trading due to IAFCU ""operational and regulatory issues""","Tradehill's founder and CEO has confirmed the bitcoin exchange platform has suspended trading due to ""operational and regulatory issues"" faced by its bank – the Internet Archive Federal Credit Union (IAFCU).  Jered Kenna said in a statement on reddit that trading on the Tradehill platform had stopped, but only temporarily.  His statement reads:    ""We have recently made the decision to temporarily suspend trading on the Tradehill platform.      Internet Archive Federal Credit Union has experienced operational and regulatory issues and we are no longer able to continue our relationship at this time.    Our unique relationship with IAFCU allowed our clients to hold their Tradehill balance in an account opened in their name and federally insured. If you had an account with Tradehill after our integration with IAFCU and would like to withdraw your funds please contact msr@archive.org.    We look forward to resuming operations soon.""    Jordan Modell, of IAFCU, also wrote a blog post on the subject, claiming that his company has enjoyed serving some of those involved in the bitcoin space, but that until it receives some clarity from regulators, it can no longer continue to serve some of its ""corporate members"".  He suggests he is still interested in helping to create a ""stable environment"" for bitcoin to thrive in.  His full blog post reads:    ""Starting three months ago we have enjoyed serving some individuals and companies involved in bitcoin that are within our field of membership. While exciting, this has also been during a period of increased interest from the press, regulators, and other financial services entities that make up the financial community.      In doing this, certain operational and regulatory issues came up including some that apply to new credit unions like ours.    Our credit union has worked within the evolving regulatory environment, which has not always been easy. This is a long not a short road and sometimes with detours. Until we have further clarity, we are unable to service some of our corporate members.    On a positive note, we are finding all involved are interested in a stable environment for bitcoin and other innovative technologies.""    Tradehill has had a pretty bumpy ride of things right from the get-go. The exchange first launched in early June 2011, but reported anomalies with Dwolla payments the following month. Fast-forward eight months to February 2012 and Tradehill was shut down after losing $100,000 in a dispute with the payment processor.  The company was back with a vengeance, though, in March of this year when it launched Prime – a B2B digital currency exchange.  “We are excited to present a new way for businesses and high-end investors to interact with the digital currency economy,"" Jered said at the time.  However, it hasn’t been smooth sailing since then. On the day Tradehill relaunched, US financial regulator FinCEN released its regulation on virtual currencies, which confirmed that anyone selling units of a decentralised virtual currency to another person for real currency or its equivalent should be categorised as a money transmitter.  This guidance applies to businesses 180 days after they begin trading in bitcoin, so Tradehill has until mid-September to get its paperwork in order.  CoinDesk contacted both Tradehill and IAFCU but had not received comment at the time of publication, so it is not known what Tradehill's next steps are. Kenna's reddit statement suggests the company will be up and running again soon, so it is likely he is in talks with other potential banking partners.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING,Emily Spaven,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/08/30/tradehill-halts-bitcoin-trading-due-to-iafcu-operational-and-regulatory-issues,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5fded55e15c15440509521753583e796298a8a80-1024x768.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425066,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHqIbh,1377857999,Rentalutions enables US residents to pay rent in bitcoins,"A company in the US is now enabling tenants to pay their rent in bitcoins, which has the potential to significantly increase the currency's use.  Rentalutions was co-founded in Chicago by Ryan Coon as an online property management platform to help landlords vet potential tenants and look after their properties, plus enable tenants to pay their rent and request maintenance work.  The company, which operates across all US states, was established in April 2012, not that long before Coon started taking an interest in bitcoin.  ""My co-founder Laurence Jankelow and I watched the value of bitcoin spike earlier this year and have been watching the recent regulatory issues. It has become obvious to us that digital currencies will play a role in our economy for a long, long time,"" Coon said.  He went on to say Rentalutions decided to add bitcoin as a payment method for tenants because his team believes it will continue growing in popularity and become a more widely accepted currency. ""As more people become comfortable with the currency, we expect individuals will want to use it to pay for things they need, including rent.""  Coon added:  ""Our decision to accept bitcoin was driven by our desire to anticipate our customers' needs.""  A few tenants have already been in touch about the possibility of paying in bitcoin and someone has requested that the company also starts accepting Litecoin, which Coon and his team are now looking into.  Austin Craig who, along with his wife Beccy, is partway through creating a documentary on living on bitcoin for 90 days, said paying rent has proved to be a rather large problem.  Earning the trust of his landlord took a while: ""If my suggestion to pay in a cryptocurrency hadn't been legitimized by a whole camera crew and an official Kickstarter campaign, I'm sure he would have flatly refused. In the end, it took over two weeks to negotiate the terms.""  The couple managed to convince their landlord by agreeing to pay a higher level of rent, but he obviously still has his reservations about digital currency, as he opened up a new bank account to accept fiat deposits from Coinbase so bitcoin doesn't have any connection to his other accounts.  ""These days, our landlord is totally fine with the arrangement. Once it's set up, bitcoin is totally painless. It's faster than a check in the mail, and it's cheaper than a credit card. He just didn't want to go through the trouble of setting up 'one more thing',"" Craig told us.  He added:  ""That said, he may have been the kind of person who would be amenable to something like Rentalutions, assuming that the company took care of the 'hassle' of setting up bitcoin payments.""  Currently, tenants can't pay in bitcoin directly via Rentalutions' website, they have to email the team with the amount their rent is in USD, then Rentalutions sends the tenant an invoice through Coinbase.  ""If the landlord is using our system, we will deposit the funds directly into the landlord's bank account. If the landlord is not on our site yet, we will mail him or her a check, which is pretty old school!"" Coon explained.  Landlords can also receive the rent payment in bitcoins, if they prefer.  If both the landlord and tenant are signed up to Rentalutions, the tenant will have to pay a 3% fee, but if the landlord is not signed up, the fee will be 5%. Coon said he is ""actively looking for ways to bring these down"" and hopes, eventually, to be able to eliminate them.  One bitcoin user, who asked not to be named, said: ""I love the idea of being able to pay my rent in bitcoins, but if doing so would cost me more than paying in dollars would, I don't think I'd do it.""  Landlords signed up with the company have to pay between $5 and $150 per month depending on the level of services they want to receive. Currently, there is no option for landlords to pay these monthly fees in bitcoins, but Coon said he hopes to set this feature up in the near future.  Earlier this month, Brigham Young University Idaho-approved housing company EdgeCreek Property Management announced it was allowing students to pay their deposits and rent in bitcoin.  Employee Daniel Larson said he has received a few enquiries about paying in bitcoin, but has received no payments as of yet. There may not be a huge demand for paying rent in bitcoins at the moment, but enabling people to do so is a big step for digital currency.

42425072,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHqIlh,1377849829,"Bitcoin: a hopeful start, a stunning spurt, and what the Romans did","Welcome to the CoinDesk Weekly Review 30th August 2013 – a regular look at the hottest, most controversial and thought-provoking events in the world of digital currency through the eyes of skepticism and wonder. Your host … John Law.  Jaw Jaw better than Law Law  As regulators, law-makers and other agencies met the Bitcoin Foundation in Washington earlier this week, one important fact became clear. If you want to get government to listen to you – no, not like the NSA – do something interesting with money that’s difficult to understand.  For, while there’s been no shortage of blowhard politicians ready to proclaim bitcoin as terrorism, tax evasion and massive drug fun all rolled into one, it turns out that Washington is well stocked with smart people who aren’t afraid to ask questions and listen to the answers.  Only one person was mentioned, sadly not by name, as being in the ‘all progress is bad’ camp (“When it is not necessary to change ...” said the Duke of Wellington, “... it is necessary not to change.” Well, this was before Darwin). For the rest, the meetings seemed to be not of the “How can we regulate the hell out of this thing?” but “What on earth is it?”.    This is a very hopeful sign. The difference between bitcoin and other potentially scandalous online happenings – privacy, naughty pictures, file sharing – which have been heavily impacted is that it is pure money.      There’s no lobbying to be done trying to say that X is so valuable and generally beneficial to the government it must be left alone, or Y is so dangerous and without redeeming features it has to be stamped out. That bitcoin is a way of moving money over the Internet as easily as a Youtube link: yes, thanks, got that. But what does it mean? How does it work?      There’s an interesting comparison to be made with illegal drugs. By and large, before the 20th century, drugs such as cocaine, cannabis and opium were unrestricted in Western societies.      Then a series of moral panics, usually connected with drug use by racial minorities, the poor or in ways threatening to children, created an ever-increasing set of laws that were intended to prevent drug use.      Few of these laws were based on evidence, even by the standards of the day, and none on the health problems drugs can cause – in other words, the reverse of the “regulate, tax and allow” approach towards alcohol and cigarettes.    The long-term results of the war on drugs are some 25% of the US prison population, huge amounts of potential tax revenue not collected but instead supporting criminal networks, and no particular diminution of the quantity of drugs imbibed – or mitigation of the health problems caused.  Given that bitcoin can’t be stopped from working any more than any other sort of computation, that people want to use it because it’s useful, and that the rest of the world is mostly open to the idea (at least until it really does cause problems), the US is faced with a fairly simple choice: decide from the outset to raise a moral panic and try yet more prohibition, or to actually take a step back, see what’s going on and not assume the worst from the word go.  Perhaps, just perhaps, a hundred-year experiment in repression through ignorance has persuaded those who run the place to think a little more freely.    As Churchill never said: we can always rely on the Americans to do the right thing. After they have exhausted all other possibilities.    Making a hash of it  This is one scary graph.  In fact, it’s many things. On the surface, it’s just a record of the global bitcoin hash rate – the speed at which people are searching for bitcoin in cryptospace. This is a proxy for a couple of other things – how hard it is to find one bitcoin, and how much energy is being expended in that search. Finally, it is exponential: doubling roughly every month.  Exponential curves are big news. They’re the signature of something turning on, of running out of control, of rules changing. The Internet went exponential in the mid-90s. The human population’s been doing it since the invention of science. And it characterises almost every aspect of the last few moments of a supernova’s life as it collapses into a black hole: exponential is strong ju-ju.    The hash rate curve seems to have kicked off around March, when the rate was around 30 terahashes a second. Coindesk first noted the trend in June, and now, at the end of August, it’s 650 Th/s – twenty times as much as March in just five months.      Assuming this carries on, then by this time next month it’ll have crossed the petahash per second marker. One petahash is one billion billion hashes. In fact, the number should be around 1.3 petahashes per second, which is one of those numbers that exceeds the capability of the sober mind to apprehend.      While it’s monumentally hard to get all the figures right, the total global energy used in doing so will be roughly the same as consumed by the sleepy South Devon town of Newton Abbot. Don’t panic about that.      Likewise, if the entire bitcoin mining system was taken over and devoted to cracking passwords protected by the SHA256 system – which is the one bitcoin itself uses – it could only manage around six eight-character passwords a second. In other words, outside the world of bitcoin, these figures aren’t that significant.      What’s driving this huge increase in mining activity? Given the relative economics of the options, anyone paying their own power bills can only be using ASIC miners – so on this evidence alone, someone’s shipping in numbers.      And with the twice-monthly adjustment in mining difficulty to rein in the increase in mining power, there’ll be no shortage of people wanting to buy new, more efficient and faster mining rigs, if the sudden upsurge in hash rate is because people are actually making money now. That market at least looks like a good bet.    What we should expect, though, is more in-depth digging out of facts, supposition and guesswork.  Who’s doing this? Where are they? How are they doing it? Is it some well-funded bunch with a warehouse of chips, or twenty million Chinese having a go? What will happen when the power consumption really does outpace the expansion of the Universe? Coming soon, to a screen near you.  Getting your wedge    Bitcoin, now: that’s a different matter. For while nobody knows where twerk comes from and selfies is, one learns, a shortened version of self-portrait photograph popularised by mobile phones and the need for social media avatars, the word ‘bitcoin’ has much more interesting provenance.      Let’s start at the end. What have the Romans ever done for us? They invented the word cuneus, which means corner or wedge, which turned into the Old French for the thing you stamped coins out with, which turned into coin. (Except in France, where coin still means corner, but what can you do, eh?) That’s mildly interesting for the technophiles, who always like words that derive from pre-modern technology.      Which leaves us with bit. You may know that this is short for Binary Digit, aka the one or zero that is all a binary number can have in it. It’s also, therefore, the smallest amount of information you can have. (Apart from in wireless networks, where you can break bits into sub-bits, but let’s ignore that.)      Bit is a new coining. The name was invented by Claude Shannon, an American mathematician who slept late, rode a unicycle, drove a camper van he called his Touring Machine (see here for why geeks find this funny), and married a computer. No, really: back in the pre-digital 40s when he was a-wooing, most scientific and industrial computation was carried out by ranks of young women called computers.      Shannon also invented information theory, which is one of the big reasons you’re reading these words at all. Information theory describes how data moves, how fast it can go and how it can be saved from corruption: it’s the bedrock of modern communications.      It’s also built on mind-bendingly hard mathematics, which is why you’ve never heard of Shannon – despite him being one of the chief architects of modern life and one of the most important mathematicians of the last hundred years.      But he did invent the modern usage of bit, as well as the idea of the bit itself, and thus deserves our thanks – it’s a bit – yes, sorry – like having his head on one side of the coin. That one of the most modern words is coupled to one of the more ancient seems apt for an idea that takes one of the ancient, abiding inventions of civilisation – money – and couples it to the Internet.    Now, try pulling something profound out of twerk.  John Law  is an 18th century Scottish entrepreneur, financial engineer and gambler. Having reformed the French economy, invented paper currency, state banks, the Mississippi Bubble and other ideas essential to modern economics, he took three hundred years off in a small cottage outside Bude. He has returned to write for CoinDesk on the foibles of digital currency.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION,John Law,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/08/30/bitcoin-a-hopeful-start-a-stunning-spurt-and-what-the-romans-did,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/72d5bcccc592ffdc2b40d4db1ec9dbe037607d54-1000x626.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
