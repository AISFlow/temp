Co-founders Ryan Shea and Muneeb Ali wrote in a blog post that the company wants to ensure that its corporate governance is decentralized, similarly to how its blockchain platform and app network functions.  ""We're determined to forge new paths and put in place governance structures that accomplish the goal of a robust and decentralized ecosystem,"" they wrote. However, the process to execute this goal will take time.  As such, the first step Blockstack's founders will take is to create a non-profit foundation, a U.S.-based entity and a Hong Kong-based entity, to begin contributing to the ecosystem alongside the existing Blockstack PBC and its venture capital wing, the Signature Fund.  Each new entity will remain independent of the others. Shea will leave Blockstack PBC to run the U.S. entity, while Larry Salibra will launch the Hong Kong company. Ali will remain in charge of the existing company.  That being said, they contend they'll all be part of the greater Blockstack ecosystem.  ""Our goal with all the above entities is to not have any overlap in control and to ensure that each entity can have its independent management and voice. The upcoming Stacks blockchain connects the entire ecosystem with individuals and entities having a shared interest in the success of the ecosystem,"" Shea and Ali wrote.

The regulator alleged in a news release that the companies – Crystal Token, Life Cross Coin and Advertiza Holdings – had placed fraudulent statements on their websites with claims of excessively high returns, insufficient disclosures and misrepresentation of facts.  The agency said none of the firms are registered to offer securities in the state. Furthermore, Advertiza allegedly falsely claimed it had filed with the SEC, while Life Cross Coin's website is operated from a Berlin IP address ""associated with ransomware, trojans, and identity fraud.""

Revealed in a bi-weekly developers meeting Friday, attendees said the upgrade has already been coded into all major ethereum clients, including those by the Ethereum Foundation and U.K. startup Parity, the most popular versions of the software that now moves more than $20 billion in cryptocurrency.  As such, developers said during the call that the upgrade is likely to go live this year. Still, a hard date has yet to be finalized, in which an activation time – triggered at a particular block – would be built into the code  As previously reported by CoinDesk, Constantinople includes five backward-incompatible changes to the network, ranging from minor code optimizations to more controversial changes such as that of a reduction in mining rewards for each block of transactions.  Still, tentative plans to release the upgrade hinge on a smooth release of the Constantinople upgrade onto an ethereum testnet called Ropsten, the primary platform for testing new code, a development scheduled to occur this Sunday.  Last week, the test release was delayed due to a bug found within one of Constantinople's five changes. During today's developers meeting, however, several ethereum software clients affirmed that they were largely ready to move ahead with testing.  ""The core developers are excited about the upcoming testnet release of Constantinople,"" Hudson Jameson, a communications officer for the Ethereum Foundation, told CoinDesk in a statement following the call.

42401966,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3Ati,1539360057,"Microsoft Is Pushing New Blockchain ID Products (But There's Pushback, Too)","Microsoft is moving to turn blockchain-based decentralized identity from a lofty aspiration into a business line.  In a white paper posted this week, the software giant says it intends to develop two products designed to give consumers greater control of their personal data – long the Holy Grail of many technologists in the blockchain space and adjacent industries.  One such product is an encrypted personal data store, or ""identity hub,"" which is a combination of user's personal devices and cloud storage that Microsoft would offer through Azure, its cloud computing service.  Although few details are provided, the general idea is that consumers could store identity information in this hub and their permission would be required for third parties to access it. This stands in contrast to the status quo, where data is held at countless third parties and regularly obtained without the user's knowledge, much less consent.  The other product Microsoft says it will build is a ""wallet-like app"" that people could use, among other purposes, to manage these permissions to their data, including the ability to revoke them when desired.  Notably – and here's where blockchain comes in – both of these products would build upon the foundation of decentralized identifiers (DIDs), a specification developed under the auspices of the World Wide Web Foundation (W3C).  Seen by many in the ID community as a breakthrough, DIDs do not require a central authority because they are registered, or ""anchored,"" on a distributed ledger or another decentralized system. This means that unlike traditional identifiers (think of a phone number or a Twitter handle), a DID is always under the user's control, much in the way a crypto user has domain over her money.  Further, the paper reveals that Microsoft is developing an open-source implementation of DIDs that would work as a second layer on top of multiple blockchains. Somewhat like bitcoin's Lightning Network is meant to allow a high volume of low-value payments in the cryptocurrency, reserving the blockchain for final settlement, the layer two for identity is being ""designed for world-scale use,"" the paper says.  The goal of that project (which Microsoft is referring to internally as ""side trees"") is to ""establish a unified, interoperable ecosystem that developers and businesses can rely on to build a new wave of products, applications, and services,"" according to the paper.  While Microsoft did not give a timetable for any of these projects, taken together, these moves suggest that the company is stepping up its investment in ""self-owned identity,"" beyond its previously reported participation in the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) as a founding member.  ""Every person has a right to an identity that they own and control,"" the paper declares, adding:  ""We aspire to make DIDs a first-class citizen of the Microsoft identity stack.""  Blockchain-inspired  Stepping back, as a decades-old, multinational corporation, Microsoft might seem to some an unlikely champion for this decentralist vision.  Yet while the majority of the components of the new system Microsoft is building would operate off-chain, the advent of blockchains has clearly fired imaginations, at the Redmond, Washington-based company and elsewhere in the ID community.  ""If you start with the premise of what blockchain can do for identity, it opens up the aperture to think about how you can have a consumer- or constituent-owned ID that then you can do different things with,"" Yorke Rhodes, a program manager on Microsoft's blockchain engineering team, told CoinDesk in a podcast interview last month.  Microsoft joined the DIF because the company wants to make sure that the systems being built today don't end up becoming ""new islands like the social media islands of today, where you can't connect an identity from LinkedIn to Twitter, to Facebook, to WeChat, to Weibo,"" Rhodes said.  Instead, in an ideal system, ""if I create my identity in a Microsoft system, if somebody comes along with MetaMask or uPort or any other wallet, they should actually be able to understand what that identity is,"" Rhodes said, referring to two ethereum-based apps by way of example.  Rhodes also said that in the next few months Microsoft would expand the range of identity types that Active Directory, its enterprise ID system, can recognize to include blockchain-based decentralized identities. This would allow a company to quickly onboard a new hire, recognize a decentralized ID that she controls, and associate it with her new corporate employee ID.  ""That is, in my perspective, one of the levers that will actually help drive toward consumer-owned identity,"" Rhodes said.  To be sure, Microsoft is not the only well-known company contributing to this emerging field. Kaliya Young, a co-founder of the Internet Identity Workshop, a semi-annual gathering of ID experts and innovators, noted that other big corporations, including IBM, Accenture and RSA, belong to the DIF, and she credited IBM in particular for its work moving forward open standards for DIDs and a related W3C initiative called Verifiable Credentials.  Further, Drummond Reed, chief trust officer at blockchain ID startup Evernym and chair of the Sovrin Trust Framework Working Group, noted that other companies, including all the ""stewards"" that operate nodes on Sovrin network (a group that includes IBM and Cisco), had been ""endorsing DIDs and portable digital credentials as the foundation of decentralized identity for the past year.""  But if it follows through on the white paper's commitment to building products like the identity hub, Microsoft may be the first household name in a field to come up with a mass-market solution.  Community work  However, some members of the ID community believe that work of this scale by a giant corporation like Microsoft should be done with more transparency.  ""I don't know what Microsoft has developed, I haven't seen any actual code,"" Wayne Vaughan, CEO of blockchain data platform Tierion and a member of the DIF steering committee, told CoinDesk. ""Microsoft has been soliciting input from the community, but their software development has largely been done behind closed doors, and now they are releasing it publicly. With that being said — it's much better than nothing.""  Vaughan believes that if corporations like Microsoft don't make their work more transparent, other big players in possession of users' identities, like Google and Facebook, might feel they are not involved and refuse to participate in the further adoption of the solutions that need to be broadly accepted to succeed.  Also, the community wants to see Microsoft not only generating pieces of code, but participating in the development of common standards for the exchange of credentials, Reed told CoinDesk, adding that in his view, that standard should support zero-knowledge cryptography, which isn't mentioned in the white paper.  Manu Sporny  , founder and CEO of payments startup Digital Bazaar and an active participant in several W3C working groups, shared similar thoughts.  ""The hope is that Microsoft will join the work on Decentralized Identifiers and Verifiable Credentials that are currently happening at W3C,"" Sporny said. ""I'm sure that in time they'll do the right thing and join the international standards efforts in the space as they have done many times before.""  Ankur Patel, principal program manager at Microsoft, responded to these concerns in an email to CoinDesk:  ""We are committed to establishing Open Standards and contributing to Open Source to make Decentralized Identity successful. As we make further progress, we will make appropriate contributions. With such a vibrant space, there are many such opportunities [to work on common standards]. We continue to evaluate and will participate in the ones that are most meaningful. We are committed to working with DIF, W3C, as well other industry or standards group that we believe can help realize a successful Decentralized Identity platform.""  In any case, as the work on different concepts and implementations is accumulating, we can expect to see the first publicly available projects using decentralized identity come live in 2019, Young said, especially pointing at the work being done by the U.S. credit union consortium CULedger and the Canadian Province of British Columbia.  ""In the next five years we will see wide-scale adoption of the tools,"" she said, concluding:  ""Identity is complex and decentralized identity solutions that put the user in the center of their own management of credentials is the only way through this complexity wormhole.""

The spokesperson told CoinDesk that the Coinbase Index Fund – first launched earlier this year – will be formally closed by the end of the month, with customers instead directed to the recently-announced Coinbase Bundle product instead. The news was first reported Thursday by The Block.  The spokesperson said:  ""After assessing demand from retail, accredited and institutional investors, Coinbase has decided to shut down Coinbase Index Fund. We will focus on providing diversified exposure to all investors through Coinbase Bundle.""  Unlike the index fund, the bundle is open to all Coinbase customers, with no accreditation required. The minimum required investment is only $25 as well, compared to $250,000 for the fund.  ""We've decided to refocus the resources devoted to managing the Coinbase Index Fund to other parts of the business,"" the spokesperson concluded.  The Coinbase Index Fund was first announced in March, though it did not go live until mid-June, when product lead Rueben Bramanathan wrote that institutional investors could invest anywhere from $250,000 to $20 million into the product.  At launch, the fund exposed U.S.-based investors to bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ethereum, ethereum classic and litecoin, which were weighted by market capitalization.  Coinbase also announced its intention to add further assets to the fund should they be listed on any of its trading platforms as well.  The confirmation comes a day after Coinbase announced it was adding the 0x Protocol token (ZRX) to its professional trading platform, Coinbase Pro. The exchange only allowed deposits of the token until Friday morning, and launched full trading later in the day.  That being said, retail investors cannot yet access or trade ZRX through coinbase.com or its mobile apps.

He went on to add:  ""We've still got a long way to go, there's a lot of issues in some of these spot exchanges, a lack of transparency, a lot of conflict of interest, a lack of systems and systems safeguards, and that's a concern. But you know, like all things, it takes time to mature, and with the movement of more institutional investors into the space, I think we'll see that [maturation].""  Giancarlo also discussed his agency's efforts to regulate the cryptocurrency derivatives markets, saying the CFTC has been taking a ""two-handed approach.""  The first aspect is enforcement, he said, noting that ""There are a lot of scammers, a lot of fraudsters in this marketplace, and when we find them we're covering the beat for them, we're taking them out, and our authority in this area has just been confirmed by two federal courts.""  These legal victories came in the last few months, with two separate federal judges ruling that the agency has the power to enforce the Commodity Exchange Act against individuals or entities potentially committing fraud using cryptocurrencies. Last month, a judge ruled that for the purposes of the Act, the CFTC could bring a case against My Big Coin and its founders.  That ruling came a few weeks after another judge ruled in the CFTC's favor as part of a separate lawsuit against CabbageTech, a company the CFTC claimed had defrauded investors by selling crypto trading advice which never materialized.  That being said, Giancarlo said the agency wants to see more innovation around blockchain-related products within the U.S. The CFTC is taking a ""first do no harm approach"" to the technologists.  He explained further:  ""It was under our watch that the very [first] two bitcoin futures products have emerged and according to the San Francisco Fed it was the bitcoin futures emerging that actually sapped the bitcoin bubble that emerged at the end of 2017 and we've seen bitcoin, perhaps, in some people's view, achieve a more sustainable level than it was during the bubble period last year.""

The exchange announced Friday that it would soon enable deposits and trading for litecoin (LTC), adding the early bitcoin spin-off to its existing offerings of bitcoin, ethereum and zcash.  Vice president of engineering at the firm, Eric Winer, wrote in a blog post that the move comes as part of the exchange's effort to support ""the future of money"" by providing ""a safe and regulated environment for both innovation and consumer protection.""  The listing has been approved by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), Winer continued, noting that Gemini is ""held to the highest standards of banking compliance and fiduciary obligations"" under the regulator's watch.  Gemini takes a ""security-first"" approach and has been ""working closely"" with the NYDFS to gain approval for litecoin trading and custody services, he said.  The exchange's clients can begin depositing litecoin into their accounts as of 13:30 UTC (09:30 EST) on Saturday, Oct. 13. Full trading will begin three days later, at the same time on Tuesday, Oct. 16, according to the post.  Litecoin will be offered in trading pairs against USD, bitcoin, ether and zcash.  Separately, Winer said Gemini originally intended to announce support for bitcoin cash as well as litecoin, but said ""uncertainty"" around one or more hard forks which may occur mid-November meant they had shelved the plan for now.  ""Some of those forks lack the replay protection feature that would be required for Gemini to safely support bitcoin cash,"" he explained, adding:  ""Because of this situation, we are delaying our launch of bitcoin cash deposits, withdrawals, and trading until late November, after the forks have passed and we can evaluate the health of the bitcoin cash ecosystem.""

The firm, which has a history going back to 1766, announced in a press release Thursday that it is collaborating with blockchain-powered digital art registry Artory to pilot the encrypted recording of auction transactions.  The pilot program will register Christie's upcoming autumn sale of artworks from the Barney A. Ebsworth Collection, a privately-held collection of 20th century Modernist American art, which is estimated to bring in $300 million in total.  Artory's blockchain platform will store data from each sale, including the item's title, description, final price and date. The startup will also provide a digital certificate of the transaction.  Christie's will then issue each buyer a registration card to access the encrypted information about their purchased artwork.  Richard Entrup, chief information officer at Christie's said:  ""Our pilot collaboration with Artory is a first among the major global auction houses, and reflects growing interest within our industry to explore the benefits of secure digital registry via blockchain technology.""  Artory said in a blog post that its blockchain registry offers a ""secure digital record of transactions, with a goal of providing greater confidence in an artwork's ongoing provenance and greater efficiency in its eventual resale.""  Christie's offers around 350 auctions annually and handled sales of $4 billion in the first half of 2018, according to the release.  Blockchain technology is gaining momentum across the art industry.

42429823,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM1U9h,1539342602,3 Bitcoin Price Factors That Suggest Bears Are in Charge,"The prospect of a deeper drop in bitcoin prices has increased, price-volume analysis indicates.  The world's most valuable cryptocurrency, which had been trading sideways since September 22, fell sharply to a three-week low of $6,220 on Bitfinex yesterday, confirming a range breakdown.  The technical indicators on the daily chart also turned bearish, validating a negative moving average crossover on the long duration charts. Essentially, bears regained control 24 hours ago, opening the doors to the key support of $6,000.  Furthermore, the bearish case is now looking stronger than it did 24 hours ago due to these three factors:  1) BTC breached key support  As seen in the chart above, BTC witnessed a Bollinger band breakdown yesterday and also penetrated the support of the trendline drawn between the June 24 low and Aug. 11 low.  This will likely embolden the bears, as the trendline had repeatedly put the brakes on any sell-off in the first half of September. Further, the trendline is now acting as a stiff resistance to the bulls.  2. Trading volumes hit multi-week highs  Trading volumes on Bitfinex jumped to five-week highs yesterday.  More importantly, total trading volume across all cryptocurrency exchanges rose 36 percent to $5.18 billion – the highest level since Sept. 21 – according to CoinMarketCap.  The fact that trading volumes have grown places greater significance on the bearish move, as a high-volume drop is always considered a strongly negative indicator.  3. Short positions rise, long positions tank  The high-volume drop was accompanied by a 10-percent drop in BTC/USD long positions and a 7.4 percent rise in BTC/USD short positions on Bitfinex.  A break below key support, when accompanied by an unwinding of long positions and a rise in short positions, indicates scope for a deeper sell-off.  So, it seems safe to say that the path of least resistance is to the downside. As of writing, the cryptocurrency is changing hands at $6,312, representing a 0.9 percent gain on a 24-hour basis.  The slight recovery from three-week lows seen overnight is likely associated with the oversold conditions seen on the relative strength index (RSI) on the hourly and 4-hour charts.  View  BTC's fall below $6,300 kick-started a bearish move toward $6,000 yesterday.  The probability of a drop to $6,000 has increased in the last 24 hours as the range breakdown was backed by a pick-up in trading volumes, as well as a rise in shorts and a drop in longs.  A UTC close above yesterday's high of $6,630 would invalidate the bearish view.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) published an advisory Friday, stating that Iran's ""illicit and malign"" use of cryptocurrency to ""exploit"" the financial system includes at least $3.8 million-worth of bitcoin-denominated transactions every year.  ""While the use of virtual currency in Iran is comparatively small, virtual currency is an emerging payment system that may provide potential avenues for individuals and entities to evade sanctions,"" the advisory said.  As such, the regulator urges that ""institutions should consider reviewing blockchain ledgers for activity that may originate or terminate in Iran."" These activities, it added, have been highly dynamic and could thrive in Iran with ""little notice or footprint.""  The Trump administration announced in May this year it would withdraw from a 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran alongside the reimposing of economic sanctions that restrict Iran's access to U.S. dollars. The executive order went into effect on Aug. 6.  The FinCEN continued that despite recent reports that the Central Bank of Iran is seeking to ban domestic banks from supporting crypto trading, it found that individuals and businesses in Iran could still access trading platforms either in Iran or the U.S., as well as via peer-to-peer exchanges.  The agency reminded domestic crypto exchanges of their regulatory obligations as registered financial institutions under the Bank Secrecy Act, which requires them to deploy ""appropriate systems to comply with all relevant sanctions requirements.""  As CoinDesk reported in July, after the U.S. government had announced the reinstatement of the economic sanctions, government bodies in Iran indicated they were working on introducing a state cryptocurrency as a countermeasure – similar to efforts made by Venezuela, which launched its oil-backed petro cryptocurrency in February of this year.

Local media source Stuff reported Friday that several sponsored posts had recently emerged on Facebook, featuring the image of the PM with headlines such as ""New investment plan for Kiwis"" and targeted at different age groups in the country.  The posts linked to a fake news site that appeared to be impersonating CNN Tech, with articles falsely claiming that the country's Treasury Department had just signed a $250 million deal to buy a company called Bitcoin Revolution.  ""This is where the future lies,"" the fake article read.  After Stuff reported the posts to Ardern's office, the latter filed a complaint to Facebook, which then moved to take down the sponsored content, the report said.  Furthermore, it appears that this is not the first time that fake news sites have associated the image of Ardern with cryptocurrency promotions. A spokeswoman for the PM's office was quoted as saying that the number of such fake ads has become too large for them to track.  They said:  ""We aren't able to manually or digitally monitor the increasing volume of fake news that fraudulently uses images of the Prime Minister.""

The commission last month investigated whether a blockchain-based solution would help track and certify Portfolio Energy Credits (PECs) in a better way for meeting the state's Renewable Portfolio Standard.  Renewable energy producers in Nevada earn PECs that can be sold to utilities that then use them to comply with the Standard. One PEC represents one kilowatt-hour of electricity generated.  ""The current PEC tracking system, NVTREC, is becoming obsolete"", PUC Commissioner Ann Pongracz said in a release on Tuesday, adding that the ""investor-owned NV Energy, the utility company that serves almost all of Nevada, no longer maintains the software and that is putting additional demands on commission staff's limited time resources.""  There is also an alternative tracking system, the Western Renewable Energy Generation Information System, which is used in the Western Electricity Coordinating Council. But it has a threshold of 1 MW (megawatt), which, Pongracz said, makes it ""not well suited to providing the value of PECs to smaller generators.""  In an attempt to address some of these shortfalls, the agency's Commissioner Bruce Breslow and its Chairman Ann Wilkinson have expressed support for implementing blockchain technology, but have also asked the staff to investigate alternative technologies as well.  The Public Utilities Commission of Nevada is not the first government agency to eye the blockchain technology for better energy operations. In July, a group of four utilities including the New York Power Authority teamed up to study the potential of smart contracts for the state's power system. The Arizona Corporation Commission has also started the investigation for the potential for blockchain technology in its energy sector.  Back in March, IT giant Cognizant said in a report that the utility space is evolving into a distributed and smart power grid.  The firm further set out the various blockchain-based (for permissioned, private ledgers) use cases – such as energy credit management, the promotion of green energy, asset optimization, payments within micro-grids, prepaid smart meters and payments to distributed generation asset owners.

42429818,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM1U1h,1539317051,EOS' Grand Governance Experiment Has a New Enemy: China's Great Firewall,"Distributed though it may be, the EOS community has fought hard to remain united.  As of June, two rival groups were briefly in competition to launch the official EOS blockchain (or mainnet) using code released by the company behind the protocol, Block.One. The standoff was resolved, and the EOS community launched a unified network later that month.  However, in the time since, another rift has emerged, an East-West divide being made worse by a language barrier between Mandarin and English-speaking members, as well as differences in internet availability. Namely, Chinese internet controls – commonly known as the ""Great Firewall"" – make it difficult for those in China and the West to converse using the same platforms: Western EOS enthusiasts mostly gather on Telegram, while WeChat dominates in China.  The fact that two broadly separate conversations are happening in parallel has made it difficult for EOS to live up to its promise as a blockchain with built-in democratic governance. It's also had tangible effects for EOS token holders, since some have had relatively easy access to dispute resolution, while others haven't.  Dispute resolution emerged as an important theme early on in the network's existence, as many community members had lost their private keys to scams and hacks. While the main arbitration body, the EOS Core Arbitration Forum (ECAF), was a source of confusion and controversy early on, it was at least able to keep some users with compromised addresses from having their tokens stolen.  In the West, at least.  Scammers and hackers targeted EOS users all over the world, but Chinese-speaking users were often unable to access ECAF's service. None of its members spoke Mandarin, and since much of the conversation around arbitration had taken place on Telegram (and in English), many WeChat users weren't aware that arbitration was even an option.  In recent weeks, however, the EOS community has begun to focus on bridging the East-West divide. A new organization, the EOS Mandarin Arbitration Community (EMAC) is working to increase Chinese speakers' access to dispute resolution, and two of its members have joined ECAF.  ""I do believe that the language barrier and cultural difference still exists,"" an EMAC spokesperson told CoinDesk in a statement, adding:  ""But with community collaboration I'm confident that they no longer pose as serious issue and we could eventually overcome them.""  An 'official language of EOS'  In statements to CoinDesk – sent via WeChat – EMAC described English as ""the 'official language' of EOS,"" adding, ""there is no doubt about that.""  Of course, EOS users speak a variety of languages, but several sources whose first language is not English said more or less the same thing: for the time being, fully participating in EOS requires English skills. (Indeed, aside from a few pleasantries, the conversations quoted here all took place in English.)  ""We found it very difficult to find any information in Spanish,"" a spokesperson for the block producer candidate EOS Argentina said of EOS' early days. As for Portuguese-language content, Luiz Hadad EOS Rio, a Brazil-based block producer candidate, said it is ""still very rare.""      Matías Romeo (left) and Jesús Chitty of EOS Argentina at a meet-up in Seoul.    Korean is generally considered EOS' third major language group. Even so, Orchid Kim, from the block producer candidate EOSYS, said ""it has been a basic assumption that Korean community […] has to provide extra effort in various translations in order to be involved in the whole EOS community.""  For the most part, according to these block producers, the portions of Spanish, Portuguese and Korean-speaking communities that were interested in EOS spoke at least some English. (It would have been difficult to develop the interest otherwise.)  Today, all three block producers are involved with some sort of translation efforts, which they say are helping broaden their communities beyond English speakers.  Despite representing a Babel of world languages, then, the EOS community outside of China is participating in a more or less unified, English-dominated conversation. And while that conversation occurs on a gaggle of channels, most of those channels are at least on a single platform, Telegram.  The Great Firewall  While participating in this broader English-language conversation may be challenging for some parts of the community, for those in mainland China, it's been extremely difficult.  ""You can't really access Telegram from inside China,"" said former VP of product at Block.One, Thomas Cox, ""so an entire swathe of our constituency was effectively frozen out. It wasn't that we didn't care, it's that we didn't know how to reach them very well.""  Moti Tabulo, head of ECAF, also noted the difficulties arising from Chinese internet controls. He pointed out that the use of a virtual private network (VPN) could allow access to Telegram.  Even so, Chinese users may be unwilling to stray far from their country's dominant platform. As Stephen Zhang, an EMAC representative, said in an interview in August:  ""WeChat is the tool in China. It's not like Western social media network. They have Twitter, Facebook and different platforms to choose from, but in China WeChat is the communication tool.""  Importantly, though, the gulf between EOS' Chinese and Western communities may have an additional dimension, besides language and choice of social media platform. As Tabulo noted, ""the concepts can be difficult to translate.""  Amy Wan, founder and CEO of the blockchain startup Sagewise, recently gave an example of this sort of difficulty, though she didn't reference EOS specifically: ""I laugh when Westerners argue about decentralization. Only a few people in the world really control bitcoin, [ethereum], etc., and they're all in China and don't give a damn about decentralization.""  To make matters worse, a recent scandal has thrown fuel on these simmering cultural differences. An anonymous Twitter account recently posted unverified allegations – originating on WeChat – of ""collusion, mutual voting and pay-offs that occur amongst the Chinese BP community"" (block producers or BPs are elected by EOS token holders and fulfill a role similar to that of miners in bitcoin).  As CoinDesk reported, some people on the English-speaking, Telegram-using side of the community vowed to stop voting for China-based block producers entirely in the wake of these allegations. And in China, ""most people are mad with this activity if it is true and the discussion of how to prevent it is very enthusiastic,"" said EOS Beijing's co-founder, who goes by Sven.  The incident points to the difficulty of building a governed blockchain that spans linguistic and cultural divides. There is an ongoing debate regarding the rules or ""constitution"" the EOS community should abide by, but it has so far occurred almost exclusively in English and on Telegram.  And of course, as mentioned above, hacks and scams have hit the Chinese EOS community harder than others because, according to EMAC, ""very few of Mandarin token-holders are fluent in English to feel confident to directly communicate and interact with ECAF.""  Looking up  The situation appears to be improving, though.  Micheal Yeung of EOS Pacific, a block producer candidate, and others founded EMAC to ""promote governance awareness among Mandarin community members and facilitate collaboration between Mandarin and non-Mandarin communities in governance and arbitration,"" according to EMAC's statement.  The job has been difficult. In July the organization stopped providing direct help to victims of token theft after some of the victims began harassing EMAC volunteers, threatening them and exposing their private information.  Today, the organization focuses on providing the Chinese-speaking community with ""education and training"" on governance in EOS. In addition, two members of EMAC, Stephan Zhang and Siqi Yao, have joined ECAF, meaning EOS' main arbitration body no longer lacks Mandarin speakers.  Meanwhile, another new organization, EOS Alliance, is hosting calls in Mandarin on arbitration and other topics, in particular the constitution. It is coordinating translations of governance-related documents to Mandarin, as well as working to reduce tensions. For example, it issued a statement on Chinese BPs' alleged vote-buying that warned against ""creat[ing] a sense that Chinese token holders or BPs are being unfairly picked on.""  Wan of Sagewise has joined EOS Alliance as the head of a working group on dispute resolution and arbitration. She told CoinDesk, ""ever since connecting with [EMAC], we've been trying to collaborate and work with them in terms of bridging the divide and not having two discussions but one large, global discussion.""  Cox, who is serving as interim executive director of EOS Alliance and an adviser to EMAC, told CoinDesk that the situation is improving rapidly:  ""I would say that as of a month ago there was a lot of sense of separation. I would say by now anybody who feels that there's an unbridgeable divide probably was on vacation for four or five weeks.""  Still, he added, the attempt to unite the EOS community and keep it united is ""an enormous undertaking."" EMAC echoed that sentiment, saying, ""there is a long way ahead of us.""  Of course, EOS is far from the only project to face an East-West divide. As Wan alluded to, there is a prevalent perception that the bitcoin network is controlled by Chinese miners, which often generates resentment in the West.  In other cases, there's an explicit assumption that the West needs one solution, while China needs its own: the smart contract platform Neo is often referred to as ""China's ethereum."" Nor is that phenomenon limited to crypto: the West has Google, China has Baidu; the West has Amazon, China has Alibaba.  Sven underscored this point when he told CoinDesk that while EOS suffered from a gulf between East and West, ""this is not the problem of EOS, it is the problem of the world.""

42429807,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM1Tbh,1539314606,Korea's Largest Bitcoin Exchange Sells Stake in $350 Million Deal,"Bithumb, currently the largest cryptocurrency exchange in South Korea by trading volume, just confirmed it has sold more than 38 percent of its total ownership to a blockchain consortium based in Singapore, for 400 billion won, or $350 million.  As reported by CoinDesk Korea, Bithumb confirmed the deal was signed on Oct. 11 with BK Global Consortium, a blockchain investment firm formed by BK Global, a plastic surgery medical group in Singapore.  BTC Holdings Company, which currently owns 76 percent of Bithumb's equity, has agreed to sell 50 percent + 1 shares of that 76 percent ownership to BK Group – a move that would make the latter the biggest controller of Bithumb when the transaction is complete.  The report added that the acquisition deal valued Bithumb at more than 1 trillion won, or around $880 million. Subsequently, Kim Byung Gun, a plastic surgeon and also the chairman of BK Group, will be the largest shareholder of Bithumb.  Based on the report, Kim is also an early cryptocurrency investor, who founded an initial coin offering (ICO) consulting firm and ICO platform in Singapore last August.  The news comes just months after several of Bithumb's shareholders revealed the crypto exchange's financial numbers, showing it made net profits of about $35 million in the first half of this year, despite a rough June for the firm after a $40 million hack.  Following a rough Q3 as the firm suspended new account openings due to a bank contract issue – which led to a significant drop in trading volume – Bithumb has seen $1.1 billion in activity over the last 24 hours, based on data from CoinMarketCap.

The payment platform focused on the adult industry announced Thursday that the hacker, who stole the funds from the platform last weekend, shared the private key for the wallet holding the ETH after speaking to SpankChain CEO Ameen Soleimani on a phone call. The company published an ethereum transaction indicating its successful recovery of the stolen tokens.  The hacker also helped SpankChain recover the roughly 4,000 BOOTY tokens that were frozen as a result of the attack, which the company then bought, another tweet added.  In turn, SpankChain sent the hacker, whose identity was not disclosed, $5,000 in reward money, $4,000 for the BOOTY tokens and the 5.5 ETH the hacker originally used to execute the attack against the platform. As the hacker had supplied the 5.5 ETH originally, SpankChain's total monetary cost was $9,000.  The news comes two days after SpankChain originally disclosed the hack, telling its users that the attacker had exploited a bug in its payment channel smart contract, as previously reported by CoinDesk.  While the hack originally occurred last Saturday, the team did not notice the missing funds until the next day due to ongoing work regarding other bugs.  Roughly $9,300 of the ETH stolen (in Tuesday's prices) belonged to customers, though SpankChain promised to reimburse its users.  In its original tweet, SpankChain seemed to harbor no ill will toward the hacker, saying:  ""Congratulations, anonymous haxor!""
