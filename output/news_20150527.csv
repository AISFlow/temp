42426355,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJMxXh,1432767972,Inside New Jersey's Proposed Digital Currency Jobs Creation Act,"A bill recently submitted to the New Jersey State Legislature proposes tax incentives that would target bitcoin miners as well as other digital currency businesses in the state.  The purpose of the Digital Currency Jobs Creation Act, according to its authors, “is to promote innovation in the burgeoning digital currency industry, to protect consumers of digital currency services and to create jobs in the State of New Jersey”.  Among the specific incentives included in the draft is a proposed tax break on energy and utility bills for digital currency miners, which the text refers to as ""digital currency servicers"".  The bill reads:  “Receipts from retail sales of energy and utility service to a digital currency servicer or a company registered under 'The Digital Currency Job Creation Act' for use or consumption directly and primarily in the creation of digital currency, including mining, shall be exempt from the tax imposed under the 'Sales and Use Tax Act.'""  The text establishes that digital currency companies would become eligible for funding under existing law created to fuel job creation in New Jersey.  Notably, the bill also includes a passage that, if approved, would empower the state to accept tax payments in bitcoin through a previously approved electronic payments system.  In line with its stated purpose of fostering digital currency innovation, the bill would stop state municipalities “from prohibiting, abridging, levying a tax upon or otherwise restricting the creation, retention, transmission or any other use of the digital currency within the state, except as otherwise provided for in the bill”.  The New Jersey Commissioner of Banking and Insurance would oversee the state's digital currency sector should the measure be approved.  Job growth boosters  The bill would allow qualifying digital currency companies the ability to receive tax breaks provided they meet certain job creation thresholds.  The tax breaks would stem from the Grow New Jersey Assistance Act, a job-boosting measure signed into law in 2012 by Governor Chris Christie and later adjusted last year.  “For a digital currency servicer to be eligible for that program, the minimum number of new or retained full-time jobs would be a minimum of 10 new or 25 retained full-time jobs, which is less than is required for certain other types of business,” the bill reads.  Digital currency companies would be able to receive additional tax breaks should they exceed these figures.  “Digital currency servicers and registrants would be eligible for, in addition to the base amount of the tax credit, an additional $5,000 for each new or retained full-time job each year,” the bill adds.  Rules for custodians  The bill echoes other state-based proposals for bitcoin regulation in its approach toward digital currency custodians, outlining the requirements related to cybersecurity, consumer risk disclosure and recordkeeping.  Among the stipulations included in the bill is a requirement that officers, major stockholders and employees that actually handle funds need to submit fingerprints to state regulators.  The bill would also empower the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance to seek injunction against companies that violate the stipulations, giving the state regulator the ability to levy as much as $5,000 per violation.

42426364,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJMxph,1432747528,Think Tank Reignites Debate Over Bitcoin Mining's Environmental Effects,"Debate about the environmental effects of bitcoin mining has resurfaced following claims by an Australia-based sustainability think tank that bitcoin could eventually consume 60% of annual global electricity production.  According to the Long Future Foundation's website, its calculations are based on the assumption that 1 BTC is valued at £1m, the cost of mining this resource is $500,000 and 3,600 bitcoins are produced every day.    ""Bitcoin miners can get power cheaply for $0.05 per kilowatt hour (kWh) which means that they get 20 kWh per dollar spent,"" notes the website.      By multiplying these numbers (500,000 x 20 x 3,600 x 365) on its Bitcurrent calculator – an interactive spreadsheet – the foundation arrives at the conclusion that bitcoin mines would consume 13,140,000,000,000 kWh – or 13,140 terawatt hours (TWh) – per annum, or the amount of energy required to power 1.5bn homes.      Guy Lane, an environmental scientist and spokesperson for the foundation, said:      ""While bitcoin is a virtual currency, it has very real economic, social and environmental effects […] Bitcoin has the potential to have an enormous impact on our global resources and energy use if not managed properly.”              Lane explained that the foundation’s bitcoin energy model assumes that miners will spend half the value of a potential million-dollar bitcoin on mining. “As their [bitcoin] value increases, more people will certainly look to create more bitcoins, the cost and energy used in this process will logically grow so long as people can make money.”    “There is a lot to be said for bitcoin as a currency, but it may ultimately be fatally flawed because of its growing energy consumption,” Lane concluded.  Debate ignited  The think tank's findings have been widely contested by the bitcoin mining community.  Sam Cole, co-founder of KnCMiner AB, spoke to CoinDesk about the relative shortcomings in the foundation's research.  He said:  ""The main thing that they [the foundation] appear to be missing is that the amount of coins released to the network is halved every four years [...] the people who produced the report are very bullish on the coin price.""  Lane said the foundation's argument rested on a ""scientific theory based on an understanding of the bitcoin technology and economic system. The scenario of $1m bitcoins is just one of the many that can be applied to the Bitcurrent Calculator.""  ""If bitcoin replaces gold and the US dollar as a global currency, maybe $1m is a low figure. Even if bitcoin only gets to $400,000 it still consumes 23% of global electricity supply,"" he added.  'Extreme argument'  Dave Hudson, author at HashingIt, a blog that looks at statistics of the bitcoin ecosystem, noted that although the essence of the foundation's argument was not fundamentally wrong, he thought that there were making a ""very extreme argument more for effect than anything else"".  Lane, however, rebutted the claims that the presented argument was extreme. ""What is extreme is the possibility of a simple technology that did not exist a decade ago threatening to overwhelm global energy supply,"" he noted.  Despite this, Hudson agreed that if potential profit margins from bitcoin mining were large, this would incentivise people to continue reaping the profits and ""one unfortunate consequence of this is energy use"", he said.  According to him, one of the issues is that the foundation's calculations assume a daily production of 3,600 bitcoins, but Hudson pointed out that as of next year this would drop to 1,800 and in another five years it would be halved further to 900 bitcoins a day.  He said:  ""To reach the sorts of values being talked about here we're now thinking of bitcoin as the major international settlement system and I'm pretty certain that the views of the current bitcoin developers would be deemed pretty-much irrelevant at that point; things would long have moved to being regulated.""  Hudson added: ""For one thing at these sorts of levels the entities controlling mining operations would now be huge corporations (the infrequency of blocks means that a degree of block-maker centralisation is inevitable) and with that would come accountability.  Green credentials would need to be established otherwise we'd see governments elected with a remit to tax such unfriendly businesses of all profits.""  Although he said that some of the more ardent decentralisation fans would potentially dispute his reasoning, Hudson believes that the only way to achieve mass-scale decentralisation would be to have hashing distributed over a vast number of devices and locations. In turn, this would mean that system-wide upgrades or protocol changes would be unpractical.

42426354,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJMxZh,1432741458,New Jersey Legislators Propose Tax Breaks for Bitcoin Businesses,"UPDATE (28th May 01:00 BST): The draft text of the Digital Currency Jobs Creation Act is now available.      Two New Jersey legislators have introduced a Digital Currency Jobs Creation Act that calls for tax breaks for bitcoin businesses.  The bill is being sponsored by State Assemblyman Raj Mukherji and State Assemblyman Gordon M Johnson. According to a report by the New Jersey Star-Ledger, the 30-page proposal would, if passed, establish a regulatory framework and set in place tax breaks for New Jersey companies that work with digital currencies.  ""I want to encourage innovation here in New Jersey. I think there's an opportunity for job creation,"" Mukherji told the publicationin an interview.  The draft text of the bill is currently unavailable for public viewing on the state legislature's website. However, the landing page for the Digital Currency Jobs Creation Act, or A4478, can be found alongside the bill's two primary sponsors.  The proposed bill comes months after the New Jersey Legislature's Assembly Financial Institutions and Insurance Committee held a hearing on how the state should approach regulating digital currencies.  CoinDesk will continue monitoring this developing story.

42426371,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJMy3h,1432722528,Consensus 2015: DOJ's Kathryn Haun to Discuss Blockchain Analysis and Silk Road Case,"The Silk Road case will make headlines again this week with Ross Ulbricht's sentencing. One of the players in the still unfolding saga is Assistant US Attorney Kathryn Haun, who heads digital currency initiatives for northern California at the US Department of Justice. Haun will speak on the blockchain and transparency at Consensus 2015.  With Ross Ulbricht's sentencing due Friday, the Silk Road story is a hot topic once again. But even when Ulbricht's sentencing is complete, the saga looks to be far from over. One of the stranger twists in an already convoluted tale is the case against two former Drug Enforcement Administration and Secret Service agents.  The agents, Carl Mark Force IV of the DEA and Shaun Bridges of the Secret Service, are being charged with wire fraud, money laundering and other offences for making off with more than $800,000-worth of stolen bitcoin during their investigation of Silk Road.  The lead prosecutor on the case is Assistant US Attorney Kathryn Haun, of the Northern District of California. According to the complaint, Haun's team made extensive use of blockchain analysis to link the illicit bitcoin flows to the accused former agents.  Multi-agency taskforce  Haun's experience isn't limited to the bitcoin blockchain, either. She also led the inquiry against Ripple Labs, which ended in a settlement and a $700,000 fine for the firm.  Haun was recently appointed the Digital Currency Crimes Coordinator for northern California at the US Department of Justice and leads a new multi-agency task force charged with looking into digital currencies that includes the FBI, Secret Service, Internal Revenue Service and Department of Homeland Security, based in San Francisco. Additionally, she will teach a course called Digital Currency and Cybercrime at Stanford next year.  Before focusing on digital currencies, Haun was a counsellor to Attorney General Michael Muksaey and was counsel to the Assistant Attorney General for National Security.  Haun will discuss data from her cases on a panel that will include Martine Niejadlik, the former chief compliance officer at Coinbase.  Corporate compliance perspective  Niejadlik headed Coinbase's compliance efforts during a period of unprecedented growth for the company, as it started operations in Europe and opened a US-based exchange. She helped the company navigate a constantly evolving legal and regulatory landscape from November 2013.  Previously, Niejadlik ran risk and compliance management teams for Boku, PayPal, eBay and Amazon. She was a founding member of the Merchant Risk Council and a lead developer of the FICO score, the de facto gauge of credit risk in the US.  At Consensus 2015, Niejadlik will discuss case studies from her experience running risk and compliance teams for 20 years, with a particular focus on her time grappling with digital currency issues at Coinbase.
