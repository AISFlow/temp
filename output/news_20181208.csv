42402296,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3yIV,1544266853,Why You Shouldn't Fear the Blockchain Regulators,"Kevin Werbach is a Professor of Legal Studies & Business Ethics at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, and the author of ""The Blockchain and the New Architecture of Trust,"" from which this article is adapted.    _______    In 2015, New York became one of the first jurisdictions in the world to adopt a regulatory regime for cryptocurrencies. The Department of Financial Services began requiring virtual currency businesses to obtain a “BitLicense” in order to operate or serve customers in the state.  “We want to promote and support companies that use new, emerging technologies to build better financial companies,” said then-New York Superintendent of Financial Services Ben Lawsky, when announcing the rules. He continued:  “Regulators are not always going to get the balance precisely right…. But we need to begin somewhere.”  Perhaps. Yet Lawsky picked the wrong somewhere. And he moved fast to formalize rules governing what was still, in 2015, a small-scale and fluid cryptocurrency community.  Bitcoin entrepreneurs and technologists argued that the threat of overbroad regulation, and the costs of compliance, would chill startup activity. More than 4,000 comments were filed on the draft rule, most of them critical.  And when the regulations went into effect, a substantial number of Bitcoin-related startups left New York, including the exchanges Kraken, Shapeshift, Bitfinex, and Poloniex. “The ‘Great Bitcoin Exodus’ has totally changed New York’s Bitcoin ecosystem,” declared the New York Business Journal.  Three years after the Great Bitcoin Exodus, the crypto-native exchanges have not rejoined the New York startup scene. But other firms have.  R3, the financial industry distributed ledger consortium with over $100 million in funding, is headquartered in New York. As one might expect, so are a number of finance-focused blockchain startups such as Digital Asset Holdings, Symbiont, and Axoni. Pillars of Wall Street such as Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, and the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange are getting into the action.  And the activity is not limited to financial services. Consensys, a venture development studio building around Ethereum technology, grew from 100 to over 400 employees during 2017 alone in its Brooklyn headquarters, and is working on dozens of innovative projects around the world (though it recently announced significant layoffs). Blockstack, a high-profile startup hoping to build “a new internet for decentralized apps” on blockchain foundations, is located in New York as well. The New York bitcoin and ethereum meetup groups each have over five thousand members.  The BitLicense, for all its flaws, did not kill off cryptocurrency activity in New York. Neither did it create the model for regulatory innovation its creators intended. Subsequent jurisdictions developing cryptocurrency regulatory frameworks explicitly distinguished their policies from the overly restrictive elements of the BitLicense.  The regulator's dilemma  Stepping back, in fast-moving areas, regulators inevitably face a dilemma.  If they move too soon, and subject new technologies to old rules without good cause, they risk killing off innovation or pushing it to other jurisdictions. If they wait too long, the public will be harmed, and the costs of imposing requirements on now-substantial industries will become even greater.  Where regulators see clear evidence of the harms they were established to prevent, they will need to act. Unclear requirements like the BitLicense create uncertainty, but so does the absence of any definitive regulatory statement. Smart regulators can encourage innovation even as they protect against abuses.  When in 1994 the Federal Communications Commission received a petition to ban “the provision of…telecommunications service via the ‘internet’ by non-tariffed, uncertified entities,” it faced a challenge similar to New York confronting Bitcoin in 2013. The voice over internet protocol (VOIP) startups springing up to provide services were not subject to the pricing, universal service contribution, consumer protection, emergency services, and other requirements that traditional phone companies faced.  The FCC managed to steer a course between chilling innovation and abandoning its mission, gradually bringing VOIP services within a set of obligations as they matured. Today, a majority of Americans who have landline phones in their homes use VOIP technology, without even knowing it. At the same time, real-time voice and video messaging on services such as Skype, Facetime, and WhatsApp has been a hotbed of innovation and adoption, with offerings that look very different than traditional phone service.  If regulators can follow the FCC model, they will support the realization of the full potential of cryptocurrencies.  Disruptive startups are not necessarily on the side of deregulation. For example, when Microsoft used its monopoly power in the late 1990s to threaten web-based services, the U.S. government intervened through antitrust enforcement to restrain it.  The internet might look very different today if there were no independent market for Web browsers, or if Microsoft had implemented its plan to charge a small fee on all e-commerce transactions, leveraging its hammerlock control over the desktop.  Moreover, the knowledge that governments were operating to police abusive practices helped promote trust in the new and unfamiliar word of virtual transactions, whether in form of PayPal transfers, Amazon sales, or Netflix subscriptions. In time, internet advocates began to call for government intervention to enforce network neutrality rules, which prevented broadband access providers from discriminating against unaffiliated services, and privacy protections.  Sign of maturity  To be sure, there are important questions about where to draw lines around surveillance and permissible uses of technology.  Criminals and terrorists will try to exploit the blockchain, just as they exploit other technologies whenever possible. Governments will over-react, and propose rules with collateral damage to legitimate operations.  The point is that these are not new challenges. Calls for regulation do not represent the end of cryptocurrency innovation; they signal the blockchain’s ongoing maturation.  Contrary to what he/she/they or anyone else might think, Satoshi Nakamoto did not create a trustless technology. Cryptocurrencies and other blockchain-based systems eliminate certain costly trust relationships, but they do so to make the transactions themselves even more trustworthy. Hundreds of billions of dollars in cryptocurrency market capitalization based on nothing but the collective belief of independent network participants might be the greatest self-generation of trust in history.  The law, and its siblings regulation and governance, are often viewed as a heavy-handed enforcement mechanism. The goal of that enforcement, however, is not to punish. It is to open up freedom of action by setting the rules of the game.  A referee gives a red card for a hand ball in a soccer match not to stop an innovative form of play, but to protect the integrity of the game. Fraud, theft, criminal activity, unjustified regulatory arbitrage, governance failures, corruption, and manipulation are the major impediments to growing blockchain and cryptocurrency markets.  If you want to change the world, and do so sustainably, law and regulation are your friends.

42402293,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3yCb,1544263231,The Era of Central Bank Digital Currencies Is Within Reach,"Kevin Rutter is the research lead at R3.    _________    “CBDC, not bitcoin” is the new “blockchain, not bitcoin.”  Since 2014, discussions of a publicly accessible digital payment vehicle issued by a central bank have matured significantly. Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) have been the center of many high-level discussions, notably at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).  The breadth of reports from experienced central bankers validates blockchain technology in a way that crypto-anarchists, armchair blockchain economists, and even millennials that got smoked by buying cryptocurrencies last Thanksgiving (2017), can collectively be proud of.  However, the cruel reality is that consumer adoption of new retail payment innovations is often difficult – whether that innovation is magic internet money or new Sacagawea U.S. dollar coins. Further, just as payment habits with physical cash, credit card, or cell phone use varies from country to country, different regional consumer preferences regarding anonymity, fees or interest payments would persist with a digital manifestation of “physical cash.”  New technologies are cool, but the road to adoption is treacherous – history is littered with the decomposed debris of failed payment innovations that did not provide what consumers wanted.  Approaches in Brazil  Successful and wide-scale CBDC implementation would require architects to consider consumer demand, payment habits, and preferences within a particular country – possibly resulting in idiosyncratic design decisions.  Adding to the growing discourse on the topic, in a recent research report for R3, JP Koning evaluates what a CBDC might look like if it were to be issued by the central bank of Brazil, the world's eighth largest economy.  While this paper anchors the analysis through specific treatment of the Brazilian market, many of the design decisions that central banks (or private sector companies on behalf of central banks) would have to make can be generalized to other economies as well.  Building on his earlier work, JP questions whether CBDCs should be in bearer form or account-based, whether they should be private like physical cash or have identities tied to transactions (and to what extent), and whether CBDCs should pay interest or not.  He presents three potential high-level archetypes for a CBDC: a cash-like digital bearer instrument; an account at the central bank; or a hybrid approach that combines features of cash and accounts.  Thinking innovatively  Thus far, central bank innovation teams have done incredible work with blockchain technology.  Project Jasper’s Phase 3 white paper, a collaborative effort between Payments Canada, the Bank of Canada, TMX Group, Accenture and R3, required coordination amongst many different stakeholders –the breadth of analysis and innovative thinking shows in the end result.  The recent report on creative approaches to cross-border settlement systems by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the Bank of England, and the Bank of Canada is a must-read for payment nerds. A report on decentralized liquidity savings mechanisms, a result of a Project Ubin prototype built for the MAS, shows the promise of decentralized netting.  The focus on wholesale, or interbank payments, thus far, is entirely merited as these projects are more contained in scope and may provide more concrete benefits to market participants, at least in the short term.  Yet while progress with wholesale payments is great, retail, or consumer, payments are also ripe for innovation.  CBDCs for the people  Despite the persistence of and even increases in the amount of physical cash in some regions, consumers globally are trending towards digital payment use.  Building digital solutions on top of existing financial market infrastructure may only enable private sector-led retail-level payment innovations to get so far.  Existing underlying payment infrastructures in several regions can lead to interoperability and access limitations and complexities.  Future innovation with platforms backed by central bank-issued money, if done with a responsible and careful architecture, has the potential to better serve payment niches that are either currently poorly addressed by the private sector, or fill the future gap left by paper’s inevitable decline in the wake of more digital payment volume.  A “big bang” move to cryptocurrencies may be (nearly) impossible, but a premeditated and deliberate phased rollout of a CBDC is not only possible, but it may be what certain types of consumers in certain types of regions need.
