We will talk with multiple guests to understand this year’s highs and lows for crypto. Related Reading: A Crypto Holiday Special: Past, Present, And Future With Blofin In the spirit of Charles Dicken’s classic, “A Christmas Carol,” we’ll look into crypto from different angles, look at its possible trajectory for 2023 and find common ground amongst these different views of an industry that might support the future of finances. Spilotro: “As a nascent technology, crypto hasn’t been as susceptive to rate cycling in the past. But as it has become a bigger part of the financial system, it now follows by that system’s rules more than the community might like.” We close this series with an in-house guest, our Editorial Director, Tony Spilotro. Dedicated to spreading knowledge and tools for anyone willing to listen, Tony keeps tabs on the market by promoting critical thinking, going against the crowd, and developing a methodical approach to trading. Spilotro: “I am confident the mainstream media has it horribly wrong. In fact, the “magazine cover indicator” is one of the most proven ways to pick tops and bottoms in the stock market.” Tony is a proponent of the Elliot Wave Theory, which has perfectly described Bitcoin and crypto’s price trajectory since the early 2010s. The market is about to take a critical path, but in which direction? This is what he told us: Q: What’s the most significant difference for the crypto market today compared to Christmas 2021? Beyond the price of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others, what changed from that moment of euphoria to today’s perpetual fear? Has there been a decline in adoption and liquidity? Are fundamentals still valid? A: The biggest difference today versus then are the macro conditions and money flow. The Fed tightening did its trick, taking the bull by the horns so to speak. Ned Davis Research had a rule, “Don’t Fight The Fed” and it was proven true over the last year plus. As a nascent technology, crypto hasn’t been as susceptive to rate cycling in the past. But as it has become a bigger part of the financial system, it now follows by that system’s rules more than the community might like. The industry was hurt badly by the domino-effect over the last several months, heightened by the LUNA collapse and FTX fiasco. But Bitcoin and some other cryptocurrencies feel fundamentally strong. Given how rough it is out there for many stocks, how well such a speculative asset class is holding up is remarkable. My belief in Bitcoin isn’t shaken, but like anything, will continue to have its ebbs and flows of investor enthusiasm. Q: What are the dominant narratives driving this change in market conditions? And what should be the narrative today? What are most people overlooking? We saw a major crypto exchange blowing up, a hedge fund thought to be untouchable, and an ecosystem that promised a financial utopia. Is Crypto still the future of finance, or should the community pursue a new vision? A: For me, time drives the narratives. The market will find a narrative when the time is right. The last narrative was Bitcoin as an inflation hedge and it performed horribly during the highest inflation in years. Narratives are very often false – but we all fall for it again and again. The next narrative will likely be overly-euphoric and result in its eventual destruction when the sentiment tide turns. I once again turn to a few things. Crypto is a nascent technology where we’ve barely scratched the surface of what’s possible. Even the internet is early in its design compared to the highway system or railroads. Crypto is a newborn by comparison. Much like the internet before it, when people don’t understand it fully, it is easier to fall victim to greater market sentiment and narratives. The dot com bubble is a great example. Much like all the other times Bitcoin was claimed dead, its doing nothing more than shaking out the non-believers and sucking up those that are ready to believe. Sadly, I don’t think there is a financial utopia ahead, rather Bitcoin becomes our best bet retaining ownership rights over value. I think it becomes the digital version of money in the mattress. Q: If you must choose one, what do you think was a significant moment for crypto in 2022? And will the industry feel its consequences across 2023? Where do you see the industry next Christmas? Will it survive this winter? Mainstream is once again declaring the death of the industry. Will they finally get it right? A: The most significant moment for crypto in 2022 had to be the FTX situation, although one might argue that would never have occurred without the LUNA collapse preceding it. I think the industry heavily feels the impact of the fallout for the next years and beyond. Sweeping regulation should occur, wiping out many shitcoins from existence. Rules will be put in place so no business can raise capital a’la FTT tokens. Some innovation will stifle, especially around DeFi and Ethereum. Scarcity and stronger network usage fundamentals will decouple from the rest of crypto. I am confident the mainstream media has it horribly wrong. In fact, the “magazine cover indicator” is one of the most proven ways to pick tops and bottoms in the stock market. When mainstream media starts reporting on it heavily, an extreme in sentiment is usually here. Q: What has been the best indicator to watch in 2022, and what indicators are you keeping track of for 2023? We know you based a lot of your analysis on the Elliot Wave theory; what can market participants expect next year according to this theory? A: The best indicator for 2022 was the weekly Ichimoku cloud. The moment BTCUSD fell out of the Ichimoku cloud, it was lights out for bulls and a deep decline followed. Granted, this happened after Bitcoin had fallen some in value – it was the confirmation that the bull run was finished for some time. I should have given this more weight, especially after seeing how Bitcoin behaved after losing the cloud back in March of 2020. Elliott Wave Theory matches price patterns the crowd isn’t often looking for – such as zig-zags or flats — with price extremes and, more importantly, sentiment extremes. Related Reading: A Crypto Holiday Special: Past, Present, And Future With Ex BNY Mellon David Schwed I’m a big contrarian in general, and I go by the nickname Tony “The Bull” so I lean bullish on BTC overall. If the crowd is bearish, I feel safer being bullish and vice versa. That said, I’m bullish on BTC for one last rally. I’ve been building the last 1-2 years of positions in anticipation of what I believe will be a shocking wave 5 for Bitcoin and the total crypto market cap.

42421413,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXo3aP,1672591800,What Will It Take for Bitcoin Mining Companies to Survive in 2023?,"It was a perfect storm for bitcoin mining companies in 2022: Interest rate hikes increased the cost of capital, mining bitcoin became less profitable as hashrate stubbornly trudged upward while bitcoin’s price tumbled and mining companies’ treasury management strategies failed them.  The result of the tempest shows up in the stock prices of the five biggest public miners by hashrate. In 2022, Core Scientific (CORZ), Riot Blockchain (RIOT), Bitfarms (BITF), Iris Energy (IREN), and CleanSpark (CLSK) traded down 99%, 85%, 91%, 92% and 79%, respectively.  Ouch.  No, this doesn’t mean that Bitcoin is dead or that bitcoin (BTC) is destined for $0. I have quite literally written the opposite. It doesn’t even necessarily mean that the public mining companies will disappear. What it definitely does mean is that we’re due for (and are in the midst of) a bit of restructuring and strategy rationalization that will leave the mining industry better than it was before.  What was wrong before?  For the last few years, some miners have held onto the bitcoin they mined, opting instead to finance operations with debt and other capital. This works really well when two things hold true:  The price of bitcoin is increasing, so the amount of people looking to get involved in Bitcoin for the sake of not missing out is high.  The cost of capital is cheap, so the amount of people looking to get involved in Bitcoin for the sake of yield is high.  And these two things were true for the last couple of years. So we had this really weird situation where bitcoin mining companies, who are in the business of mining bitcoin, weren’t explicitly making money by mining bitcoin. Instead, they were making money by financing the mining of bitcoin.  This is a bit of an oversimplification, but really just a bit.  In our theoretical world, a bitcoin mining business makes money like this: The business has bitcoin mining machines which mine bitcoin, and the business in turn exchanges a portion of that mined bitcoin to pay for the expenses needed to run the business.  In our wacky world, a bitcoin mining business makes money like this: The business has bitcoin mining machines which mine bitcoin and the business in turn takes capital from the debt or equity markets to pay for the expenses needed to run the business.  I’m not saying companies do this exactly, but there are mining companies like Marathon Digital that have stuffed all the bitcoin it has mined the last 26 months on its balance sheet rather than selling any of it to pay for operations.  Bluntly, this doesn’t make a shred of sense to me. I stand by the idea that businesses should strive to function as a going concern in the long run – without a dependence on the capital markets – and make more money than it costs to make that money. Otherwise, that business shouldn’t exist.  So when our wacky world moves on to a place where: 1) the price of bitcoin is decreasing, 2) the cost of capital is increasing and 3) bitcoin mining is getting more competitive, you might be in for a world of hurt.  Well, all those things happened in 2022, so cue the recent news of a Core Scientific bankruptcy, a fulsome restructuring and capital infusion to save Argo from bankruptcy, and the resignation of Bitfarms’ CEO.  So what’s better now?  What now? We know the public mining companies are struggling, but amid all the pessimism there’s (of course) reason for optimism.  See, in theory, mining companies will mine when it’s profitable and won’t mine when it’s not profitable. The mining machines these companies run can be shut off and turned on easily.  But in practice, miners aren’t shutting down and ramping up their operations based on the everyday price movements of bitcoin or electricity. Instead, miners mine consistently through market vacillations. And because of that, there is a need to practice some sort of treasury management strategy that extends beyond “hold all the mined bitcoin.”  The strategy would involve some sort of consistent exchange of a portion of mined bitcoin to fund operations. Because eventually the price of bitcoin might start going down or the price of electricity might start going up.  Or both.  Public markets investors value both a predictability of cash flows and upside valuation potential. Public bitcoin mining companies have the latter in spades, but the former is sorely missing. A proper treasury management solution should anticipate and mitigate the unevenness of profitability associated with the markets that govern the bitcoin mining industry.  This strategy wouldn’t allow a mining business to hold on to as much bitcoin as possible to sell at an elevated value during a bull market, but it would allow the mining business to more easily handle market stress. Besides, miners aren’t in the business of timing markets; they’re in the business of mining.  So whatever happens now, at the very least we should expect that the mining companies that survive this perfect storm and market downturn will make some sort of change. I think big, public mining companies will revisit their “hold all the mined bitcoin” strategy and that should better equip them to thrive well into the future.  Assuming, of course, the miners learn anything from this.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,George Kaloudis,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/01/01/what-will-it-take-for-bitcoin-mining-companies-to-survive-in-2023,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4dafc91f6ca6691dcedeb5e6ab4521f3130bec9d-8165x6123.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42388274,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRCVcJ,1672567200,UK Enforces Crypto Tax Break for Foreigners Using Local Brokers,"The U.K. is enforcing a tax exemption for foreign investors purchasing crypto through local investment managers or brokers starting Sunday.  The tax break, announced in December, is a part of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s plans to turn the U.K. into a crypto hub.  “This exemption is an important factor in attracting global investors, meaning foreign investors won’t be brought into U.K. tax simply by appointing U.K.-based investment managers,” the government's tax arm, the HM Revenue and Customs, said in an email to CoinDesk. “To build upon the U.K.’s position as an investment management hub, this exemption has been extended to include crypto assets, so that funds which include them aren’t put off from appointing U.K. managers.”  The country already has a tax guide for resident crypto traders. In July, the HM Revenue and Customs published a consultation to gather views from investors and professionals on how it should tax decentralized finance (DeFi).  Parliament is debating the wide-ranging Financial Services and Markets Bill that would give local financial regulators more powers over crypto if passed into law. The U.K. Treasury also plans to kick-start a consultation in the coming weeks on how the crypto sector can be regulated.
