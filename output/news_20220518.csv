Saylor founded MicroStrategy in 1989, and they have been adding Bitcoin to their balance sheet for the past two years. The company has spent close to $4 billion on Bitcoin, which costs an average of $30,700 per unit. Normalizing Bitcoin-backed Finance MicroStrategy added Bitcoin to its balance sheet in August 2020, which wasn&apos;t so popular then. The coin was worth around $11,000 at the time.

The developers designed them to maintain their value over time and linked them to a fiat currency, usually the US dollar. In this configuration, one unit of cryptocurrency equals one fiat currency unit. In contrast to extremely volatile cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, the value of stablecoin is constant. However, due to recent events in the stablecoin market, like the crash of TerraUSD, the government is actively investigating this sector. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has stated that stablecoins threaten financial stability. In addition, the Federal Reserve issued a paper condemning the lack of transparency and regulation in the stablecoin market. What are Stablecoins? Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that have their value connected to another asset. Most of the time, the other asset is fiat money, such as the US dollar or the euro. The coin&apos;s value remains stable over time, at least in proportion to its linked currency. This is because the underlying asset&apos;s value remains constant. In some ways, it&apos;s as if the underlying asset, such as a dollar, has been transformed into a computer file. They back up stablecoin by the asset to which it links because they aim to track an asset.

42423295,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2YCJh,1652904879,"Market Wrap: Bitcoin Dips, Stocks Plummet as Volatility Spikes","Bitcoin (BTC) declined by nearly 3% from a high of $30,654 on Wednesday, tracking losses in U.S. stock markets, which included a drop of over 1,200 points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average and losses of over 4% on the Nasdaq and S&P 500.  The cryptocurrency has been stuck in a tight trading range over the past few days, although volatility remains elevated. That could increase the risk of greater price swings or a potential breakdown on the charts.  For now, alternative cryptos (altcoins) continue to underperform bitcoin, indicating a lower appetite for risk among crypto traders. For example, ether (ETH) was down by 4% over the past 24 hours, compared with a 3% dip in BTC over the same period. Solana's SOL token declined by 7% and Decentraland's MANA token was down by 10% on Wednesday.  Just launched! Please sign up for our daily Market Wrap newsletter explaining what happens in crypto markets – and why.  The stock market declines came after retail and tech stocks underperformed on Wednesday. Also, the Chicago Board Options Exchange's CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), a popular measure of the stock market's expectation of volatility based on S&P 500 index options, ticked higher on Wednesday, reversing a week-long downtrend.  Latest prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $29,225, −2.67%    ●Ether (ETH): $1,975, −3.28%    ●S&P 500 daily close: $3,924, −4.03%    ●Gold: $1,814 per troy ounce, −0.21%    ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 2.89%     Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time. Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Volatility returns  Bitcoin's short-term realized volatility remains elevated as the cryptocurrency struggles to hold the $30,000 price level. And implied volatility (based on the market's expectation for movement over one week), ticked higher on Wednesday. That suggests price action could remain choppy as traders react to macroeconomic risk and turmoil in the stablecoin market.  Option market data still shows increased demand for puts versus calls, which means traders are actively hedging the risk of continued price declines.  Currently, the options market places a 66% probability that BTC will trade above $25,000 in June, according to data provided by Skew.  Sellers in control  The chart below shows the ratio of buy volume divided by sell volume in bitcoin's perpetual swaps market, a type of derivative trading product similar to futures in traditional markets.  Values greater than 1 indicate bullish sentiment, while values less than 1 indicate bearish sentiment. The 50-day moving average of the buy/sell volume ratio has declined over the past two months, indicating persistent selling pressure.  Further, the ratio is still above prior lows, which suggests the downtrend in BTC's price could continue until buyers return with greater conviction.

42421167,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXd4yj,1652902245,Diana Sinclair: People Aren’t 'Ready to Hear' About Inequities in the Metaverse,"When she was a preteen, Diana Sinclair would draw and create digital characters through a social app called Draw Something. “Communities of teenagers,” she says, were on the app, where they came together by commenting under each other’s illustrations and sharing their work.  “People would do role-playing games or have long conversations in the comments,” Sinclair recalls. “It was like a fever dream.” Some would ask to swap characters with each other, occasionally even paying for the privilege via their parents’ PayPal accounts. But one day, the app announced it was shutting down, and the communities of artists that had formed there started frantically asking questions: “Do we save our artwork? Where are we going to go now?”  This article is part of Road to Consensus, a series highlighting speakers and the big ideas they will discuss at Consensus 2022, CoinDesk's festival of the year June 9-12 in Austin, Texas. Learn more.  They eventually migrated to a different drawing app, but Sinclair, for one, hadn’t bothered to save any of her art from the original one. Now that she has gotten into non-fungible tokens (NFT), she sees how technology could have saved those now-lost drawings from disappearing into the ether.  “Digital ownership is super important,” she says. “Our worlds are getting increasingly virtual … [H]aving a record of what you do online [and being able to] look back in several years … that’s going to mean a lot historically.”  Sinclair, a visual artist whose media span photography, video, and digital and hand drawing, started exploring NFTs in February of last year. Her partner at the time was making 3D digital art, but there wasn’t much of a market or display venue for that type of work. “The [NFT] space really hit hard, especially in that community,” Sinclair says, sitting in her room in New Jersey surrounded by art supplies, sunlight streaming in the windows behind her when we talk via Zoom.  Sinclair counts herself among the first photographers and video artists to have entered the NFT realm before the big photography boom in summer 2021. To date, she’s helmed The Digital Diaspora, an art exhibition that debuted around Juneteenth [June 19] 2021 that consisted of Black NFT artists’ work appearing on Link screens all over New York City, and she created a video project paired with a previously unreleased Whitney Houston demo track in a collaboration with Houston’s estate, which together sold for more than $1 million back in December. In July, Fortune named her one of the 50 most influential people in NFTs, and TIME featured her as an artist in the magazine’s first NFT collection.  Even though it’s about digital identity, our bodies are not going away. And the struggles that come with our bodies are not going away.  Sinclair’s first-ever NFT sold in April 2021. The photograph was part of a series called ""I Am the Black Gold of the Sun"" (named after a song Sinclair’s mother introduced to her), which she’d shot the previous August – one of the first photo shoots she’d ever done. About “coming into yourself and coming into your light, despite oppression and despite pain,” Sinclair says, the photograph with the same title as the series depicts a young Black man standing about thigh-deep in water, translucent yellow fabric covering his head, the sun highlighting his form.  “To me, at that point, selling wasn’t super important,” Sinclair says. Rather, being a part of a community was the exciting part about entering the NFT space. It reminded her of the kinds of interactions she’d have back on Draw Something. “It was the first time since my digital art app days that I've been among a community of artists that were talking all the time. There was a lot of joy and excitement,” she says. “It was really cool.”  ***  Sinclair shortly became immersed in a community of artists selling their work as NFTs, and then in the wider NFT community on Twitter. She began using her platform in the space to curate NFT works of artists she admired through Twitter threads, “like 15 or more artworks on each one,” she says. “These are some Black artists in the space you really need to check out,” like Serwah Attafuah, LUZ and Blacksneakers.  People started getting invested in Sinclair’s curated Twitter threads, and the works she presented began selling out. It made her think: “We need to bring curation and a spotlight to artists in a grander way.”  This led to Sinclair curating her most ambitious NFT project at the time, ""The Digital Diaspora."" Timed with Juneteenth, the U.S. holiday (as of 2021) commemorating the day African-American slaves in Texas were informed of their freedom in 1865, the project featured the work of Black artists from six countries. Crucially, it aimed to increase their visibility in the emerging Web 3 world, which reflects real-life prejudices that leave Black artists marginalized.  Sinclair worked with NFT marketplace Foundation and Towards Utopia, a nonprofit supporting “Black creativity,” to auction off ""The Digital Diaspora"" pieces. The auction helped raise funds for G.L.I.T.S., Gays and Lesbians Living in a Transgender Society, which provides health care and housing to transgender sex workers and others who identify as LGBTQIA or BIPOC in the New York City area. The Digital Diaspora artists’ works stayed up across New York City for about two weeks.  It was a “huge moment,” Sinclair says, but it also revealed an aspect of the NFT space at the time that left her feeling “bogged down.”  “It was a little bit too early,” she says. “I don't think that people at the time were ready to hear that message and recognize that inequality was possible in this new world that was being developed.”  This describes the type of blind utopia ethos that often comes across in Web 3, particularly among those who enthusiastically believe that a decentralized internet (populated by anonymous avatars that hide users’ identities) will level the hierarchies that exist in the physical world. Using avatars like a Bored Ape or a CryptoPunk means Web 3 participants don’t have to reveal their skin color or gender, and this leads to the frankly misguided notion that those identities don’t play a part in this digital frontier.  “A lot of people are saying, ‘We're in the metaverse, identity doesn't exist, skin color, race, gender identity doesn't exist,’” Sinclair says. “That’s not true.” It’s even less true when what a lot of people want to get out of joining Web 3 communities online is the real-life experiences that come with them – the in-person meetups, the parties like Ape Fest and the conferences full of networking opportunities. People still want to find others they can relate to, who share their interests and experiences. “Even though it’s about digital identity, our bodies are not going away,” Sinclair says. “And the struggles that come with our bodies are not going away.”  But when everyone is an anonymous penguin or doodle or witch, it’s harder to connect with the people who share your struggles, and sharing your struggles is one of the best ways to process and even overcome them. “You can't be, like, ’I can identify with the struggles of Black artists, I'm going to join a community with Black artists,’” she says.  Sinclair’s currently working on a project to connect the dots between the extremely online NFT world and the physical spaces where its participants come together. She started it at the South by Southwest festival in March, setting up what she describes as a portable photo studio to take Polaroid portraits of NFT community members who attended the Austin, Texas, event.  “It's about documenting physical identity versus digital identity,” Sinclair says. Tangible Polaroids felt like a fitting way to embody the physical aspect of the project, which she plans to mint in stages as she takes more photos at different Web 3 events, including the upcoming Consensus conference, also in Austin. Through the project, she’s already gotten to meet a wide swath of NFT enthusiasts face to face, and she has been pleasantly surprised by the variety of their interests in the space.  “In some ways I’m a bit overexposed to all these different opinions on Twitter, so it was nice to sit down and get each person's individual thoughts about why they were there at that event,” she says. She met a 12-year-old girl “badass bitch” NFT collector and a founder of Sound.xyz, a platform where musical artists can sell their sounds as NFTs. “We had a great conversation about Black culture and music culture and bringing that to the space,” she says.  ***  Despite the importance Sinclair places on identity, she took advantage of Web 3’s anonymity early on in her still-budding NFT career. Sinclair is 18 years old, 17 when she started in the space, and she didn’t want others to immediately judge her based on her age. “I really wanted to see how people were receiving me and my art for who I was, the thoughts I had and the work that I was putting out,” she says. “I didn't want to feel like I was getting by on a crutch of, ‘Oh, she's so young’ … and for that to become the sole narrative of my work.”  However, Sinclair’s youth helped secure maybe her most high-profile work yet. Around September, entertainment-focused NFT platform OneOf contacted Sinclair, saying it was working with Whitney Houston’s family on an art project – a video to go with a track Houston had recorded when she was 17 that hadn’t been previously released. Houston’s family was looking for the right creator to take on the job, and when Houston’s sister-in-law met Sinclair, she “fell in love” with her and her work.  She also noticed similarities between Sinclair and Houston, besides the age at which they’d be collaborating, across time, on this piece. Both valued family, community and warmth, Houston’s family talking up how bright and caring the singer was before she passed away in 2012.  I didn't want to feel like I was getting by on a crutch of, ‘Oh, she's so young’ … and for that to become the sole narrative of my work.  Though Sinclair had listened to Houston’s music before, she didn’t grow up with it in the way slightly older generations might have. That allowed her to take the time to get to know Houston as an artist rather than as the icon she became in her lifetime. “That was nice, being able to take a step back and absorb … Whitney herself from that lens instead of just icon status,” she says. “You can lose people's humanity a little bit when you look through that lens.”  Ultimately, youth played a big part in Sinclair’s project with the Houston estate. The family wanted Sinclair’s young age to help keep Whitney’s work relevant. “I kept saying, ‘No one needs me to keep Whitney Houston relevant,’” she says. “They just wanted her to stay modern.”  Sinclair’s work in NFTs certainly fit that modern criteria, and the way she went about creating the project further embraced youthful energy. She hired only young people – teens and young adults – to assist on set, from the stylist to the models. The set, she describes, was overflowing with “beautiful Black energy,” and she got to pay everyone’s requested rates.  ***  It’s not easy having so much influence at such a young age (or really any age), and it has taken a toll on Sinclair. “I felt this massive pressure of Black people falling behind in this space, because there's so much money floating around,” she says. “We're already so far behind in the American financial structure, which is literally built to oppress Black people.”  While she feels compelled to educate people about Black artists and the importance of highlighting their work in Web 3 to get them in through barely opened doorways, doing that takes a lot of work. And Sinclair has gotten tired.  “Being so young and having all that pressure to onboard a lot of people – I wanted to do it so badly, and it's still so important to me,” she says. “I realized, in fall and winter last year, that my mental health was really suffering.”  Despite all the talk, the magic of Web 3 is not going to automatically wipe out power structures that have been in place for centuries or even longer. With more and more “Web 2 brands” entering the space (Nikes, Adidas, and numerous fashion brands have hopped onboard), bringing along their Web 2 money and clout, they’re creating seductive opportunities for artists and builders operating in Web 3. Those brands then “turn people away from the original ethos” of Web 3, Sinclair suggests, in favor of traditional capitalist goals. “But I think people do need to take a step back and realize what it does mean to give those brands and those companies power in this space.”  Still, there’s hope for Web3, she thinks, pointing to disruptions that have taken place already in the traditional art market – like artists learning about the perpetual royalty structure built into most NFT sales contracts and asking their galleries for perpetual royalties, as well. That practice is basically unprecedented in the establishment-art world, and most artists would never have thought to request it before NFTs. “But the thing is, it's a lot harder to track that without the blockchain,” Sinclair says.  Besides their utility in tracking royalties, blockchains also offer a sense of permanence to digital art. While the work Sinclair created as a preteen using drawing apps disappeared with those apps, her blockchain-based pieces have a lengthy lifespan ahead of them.

42423283,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2YC5h,1652901905,Biden Administration Wants Crypto Exchanges to Separate Customer and Corporate Funds,"U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration will press Congress to demand cryptocurrency exchanges keep their customers’ money separate from their own corporate funds, according to a person familiar with the plan that could constrain the way the industry does business.  Spurred by Coinbase’s (COIN) recent disclosure that customers’ money would be jammed up if the company declared bankruptcy, federal officials intend to push U.S. lawmakers to fix the problem by insisting that a future legal framework require crypto firms keep customer assets walled off. That type of custodial rule is standard for financial firms such as futures platforms, but crypto exchanges routinely mingle their funds with customers’ holdings in the same pot – a situation the administration wants to see ended by legislation. The securities industry commonly commingles funds, but the investments are also more heavily regulated.  Federal officials will push in the coming weeks to put the change into any crypto bill considered by Congress, the person said, building on a contention last year in the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets report on stablecoins: Companies that host crypto wallets need close federal oversight. The administration thinks the trading platforms should still permit pooling of customers’ assets, allowing the companies to keep managing trades internally rather than having to put each move on a blockchain.  Coinbase, a publicly traded company that is one of the industry’s largest exchanges, admitted in a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission last week that “in the event of a bankruptcy, the crypto assets we hold in custody on behalf of our customers could be subject to bankruptcy proceedings and such customers could be treated as our general unsecured creditors.” That’s the bottom rung of people paid back when a company fails, suggesting a misstep by Coinbase could indefinitely lock up clients’ tokens – or funnel them away to pay other creditors.  ""Don't think you actually own your tokens when you go into a digital wallet,"" Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler said at a conference this week, underlining some of the federal government’s concerns about custody of investors’ assets. ""If the platform goes down, guess what, you just have a counterparty relationship with the platform. Get in line in bankruptcy courts.""  When a firm takes a customer’s tokens, they can use them as they will, Gensler pointed out. In fact, the exchanges are “often trading against you,” he said. And since customers lost billions in the wreckage of Luna’s algorithmic stablecoin, terraUSD (UST), his investor-protection advocacy could gain momentum.  “Congressional Democrats will follow his lead and escalate their calls for greater oversight,” predicted Jaret Seiberg, a Washington-based analyst at Cowen Group, Inc., in a research note this week. “The troubles with TerraUSD and the drop in crypto valuations will make it politically more challenging for Republicans to effectively oppose Gensler's policy agenda.”  For its part, Coinbase – staggered by a loss of more than 80% in its share price since last year – assured its nervous customers and investors that the distressing splash of its SEC filing wasn’t meant to signal anything about its prospects. Founder and CEO Brian Armstrong said that the disclosures were merely responding to a new SEC requirement, and his company isn’t in danger of filing for bankruptcy protection.  For now, crypto’s leading platforms – also including names such as Binance.US, FTX and Kraken – don’t need to strain themselves to meet the administration’s push for a custody rule. A closely divided and essentially immobile Congress isn’t likely to produce legislation this year, especially as lawmakers gear up for the bloody arena of the midterm elections in November. The most optimistic guesses see a crypto bill getting traction when the dust settles on the new Congress next year.  But not everybody sees fencing off customers’ money as the best answer.  “Instead of focusing on the lack of client asset segregation at digital asset exchanges, which is also true with securities held in ‘street name’ at DTCC, legislators should work on a Digital Asset Investor Protection Act that mirrors the Securities Investor Protection Act,” said Dave Weisberger, co-founder and CEO of CoinRoutes, Inc. It could give investors “primary status in bankruptcy proceedings,” and it could also set up a backstop fund to cover losses like the one securities investors have.  For others, a law banning firms from blending customers’ assets with their own would still represent a bare minimum for those calling for rigorous investor safeguards.  ""There is a lot more that has to be done,"" said Patrick McCarty, a financial consultant and former regulator who teaches crypto classes at Georgetown Law. He said segregated accounts would be ""a significant step forward"" but argued strict regulations and a deeper overhaul of the business model are needed to return to crypto's founding ideas about recording every transaction on an indelible public ledger.  ""Why would one advocate for a band aid – albeit significant – when it looks like major surgery is needed to protect investors?"" McCarty said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | LUNA | REGULATION | TRADING,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/05/18/biden-administration-wants-crypto-exchanges-to-separate-customer-and-corporate-funds,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f37449df44f786349968783b1797f65f4e0872f0-4224x2376.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Whales Are Behind Almost 90% Of Bitcoin Exchange Inflows Right Now As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, whales may be ramping up dumping, a sign that could be bearish for the price of BTC. The &apos;exchange whale ratio&apos; is an indicator that measures the ratio between the sum of the top ten Bitcoin transactions to exchanges and the total exchange inflows. Since the 10 biggest transactions to exchanges usually belong to the whales, this metric can tell us about the relative size of whale inflows to the rest of the market. When the value of this metric is high (that is, above 85%), it means whales currently make up a very large part of the overall exchange inflows. Especially high values can suggest that whales are mass dumping at the moment, something that could prove to be bearish for the price of Bitcoin. On the other hand, the indicator having values lesser than 85% can imply whale selling in the market is at a healthy level right now. During bull runs, the metric usually remains in this range.

""After much thought, it's time to talk about the last week and, more importantly, the weeks ahead,"" said Novogratz, returning to Twitter for the first time in 10 days.  The tweet links to a longer letter in which Novogratz reminded readers that it has been a ""brutal macro backdrop"" for all risk assets in 2022, with any number of growth stocks down 50%-70%, core crypto assets like bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) off nearly 60%, and altcoins lower by an average of 80% from all-time price highs. The central banks, he said, are turning off the monetary spigots that contributed to a massive liquidity bubble.  Novogratz: ""This macro backdrop put pressure on luna and the reserves held to back UST. UST’s growth had exploded from the 18% yield offered in the Anchor protocol, which eventually overwhelmed other uses of the Terra blockchain. The downward pressure on reserve assets coupled with UST withdrawals, triggered a stress scenario akin to a 'run on the bank.'""  The ""flash-crash"" in Terra and UST, said Novogratz, reinforced – among other things – the need to take profits along the way. Galaxy did just that, he added – something that had been alluded to in a filing earlier this month.  While remaining highly bullish on the outlook for crypto, Novogratz said those hoping for a ""V"" bottom in the market are likely to be disappointed.

The new analytics software, Storyline, peers through the smart contracts powering decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFT), two hotbeds for crypto transactions of all stripes – criminal included. Chainalysis says DeFi protocols have already lost well over $1.5 billion to crypto thieves this year.  Storyline’s role in combating that trend is by building for investigators a simple, timeline-pegged visualization of where this money flows.  In a presentation Wednesday at Chainalysis LINKS conference in New York, Chief Scientist Jacob Illum showed the audience how the transaction hash of a single Bored Ape NFT theft can lead through a web of wrapped assets, stablecoins, chain hops and exchanges to uncover multiple suspects.  “You have an entire investigation that tells the entire story of what happened,” Illum said from the stage.  The software adds another tool to Chainalysis's pricey investigative suite that’s become a hit among investigators looking to make sense of transparent, albeit obtuse, crypto transactions.

42411469,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glO5A2,1652894475,What to Watch for in Tether's Upcoming Attestation Report,"With the crypto bull market turning into a rout, speculators and investors have been cashing out of stablecoins in droves. Into this chaos, the world’s largest stablecoin issuer – Tether – is about to publish its most important reserve, or attestation, report ever. Here’s why Tether’s upcoming attestation is key and what investors are looking for.  It’s been a difficult few months for stablecoins. According to data from Coin Metrics available at The Block, the total value of the stablecoin market has fallen from $182 billion in April to $154 billion today, a quick 15% reduction.  J.P. Koning, a CoinDesk columnist, worked as an equity researcher at a Canadian brokerage firm and a financial writer at a large Canadian bank. He runs the popular Moneyness blog.  Most stablecoins have hewed tightly to their peg through the Great Stablecoin Pullback of 2022, including second- and third-ranked USD coin (USDC) and BinanceUSD (BUSD), both U.S.-domiciled. The decline in the values of these stablecoins comes purely from a fall in quantity as people convert stablecoins into actual U.S. dollars. The pegs of large decentralized collateralized stablecoins like DAI and MIM have also held, as people redeem them for underlying collateral like ethereum (ETH) and USDC.  Read More: Tether Cut Commercial Paper Reserve by 17% in Q1, Accountants Say  This shrinking in the quantity of stablecoins is a healthy market reaction. Given that crypto activity has petered off over the last months, fewer stablecoins are needed to grease the rails of the crypto economy. It’s the task of stablecoin issuers to hoover up unwanted stablecoins in order to contract their supply and keep their price locked at $1.  Alas, other stablecoin pegs have completely broken down, most famously terraUSD (UST), an undercollateralized “algorithmic” stablecoin that, at the time of writing, is trading at 9 cents. Several other uncollateralized stablecoins, including neutrino USD (USDN) and Deus Finance's DEI, have also experienced large deviations from their peg. Kava Network’s USDX recently fell to 80 cents, reportedly due to its exposure to terraUSD backing.  Then there’s tether (USDT), the world's largest stablecoin. The price of tether on large exchanges like Coinbase (COIN), Binance, Uniswap and FTX temporarily plunged to 95 cents on March 12. It has since risen back towards $1.  But the price of tether has not quite clawed back to the exact same $1 watermark to which it adhered prior to March 12. It is trading at just under $1 on major centralized exchanges like FTX and Coinbase. On the decentralized stablecoin market Curve, $100,000 USDT can only be converted into $99,851 USDC, a small but notable discount. Also worrisome is the continued unbalancing of Curve’s 3pool, a major source of stablecoin liquidity, with tether now making up for 74% of value locked-in.  All this suggests that there's still too many tether stablecoins in the market, and that the only remedy is additional supply contractions.  Read more: What Happened to the $3.5B Terra Reserve?  Tether has already shrunk dramatically over the last week. After hitting a peak of 83.2 billion USDT in circulation just last week, redemptions have reduced this amount by 11% to 74.2 billion. To repeat, there is nothing unhealthy per se about a supply contraction. The demand for tethers is lower and supply must be reduced to adjust to this demand.  However, more redemptions will be necessary to return tether to its tight $1 peg across all trading venues. Add to this the possibility that the prices of bitcoin, ethereum and other coins may fall further, inducing additional contractions in stablecoins supply, and tether could have another few billion in shrinkage ahead of it.  Is that something tether can handle?  Unfortunately, the Great Stablecoin Pullback of 2022 comes at an inopportune time for tether users. Thanks to issuer Tether’s policy of only publishing reserve reports every 90 days, they face a shortage of timely information about the assets used to back USDT.  When a stablecoin issuer issues stablecoins into the market, it normally keeps a corresponding asset in reserve to secure, or back, the stablecoin’s peg. As redemptions requests arrive, these reserves get used up. Because a stablecoin’s reserves are key to guaranteeing stability, the big, centralized stablecoin issuers have adopted the practice of providing information about their assets. In regularly published attestation reports, an independent auditor is asked to offer assurance about the quantity and composition of reserves backing the stablecoin.  The people behind USDC and BinanceUSD publish monthly attestations. Alas, Tether has the slowest attestation schedule of the bunch, reporting on a quarterly basis. With Tether's March 31 attestation report still not published, investors find themselves having to fall back on Tether's Dec. 31, 2021, report. But that was an eon ago in cryptocurrency time.  There was plenty to like from Tether’s old report. As of Dec. 31, 44% of Tether's $79 billion in assets were held in safe U.S. government-issued Treasury bills. This constitutes a big improvement from previous quarters. For instance, when Tether first began to report its asset composition to the public in early 2021, only 2% of its assets had been placed in Treasury bills while a hefty 50% had been allocated to riskier commercial paper, the rating of this paper not being reported.  The amount of commercial paper Tether holds had been steadily reduced over time, reaching 31% on Dec. 31. And thanks to improved disclosure by Tether, we now know the rating of this paper: most was A-1 or A-2, which qualifies as investment grade.  Another $4.2 billion, or 5%, was invested in safe cash and bank deposits as of Dec. 31.  This combination of safe investments – cash, investment grade commercial paper and Treasury bills – will have been great fodder for meeting the first $9 billion or so in Tether redemptions. It will be invaluable for subsequent waves of redemptions requests, too.  These improvements are the result of an awkward and confrontational dance between Tether executives and so-called “Tether truthers.” To counter critics, the company has been forced to cough up ever more internal data, which has fueled better criticism, which pushed Tether to make follow-up changes like shifting into safer assets like Treasury bills. Tether now has a serviceable front-line defense against redemptions – thanks in no small part to its critics.  But there were problems with Tether’s Dec. 31 attestation, too. The most concerning part was the $5 billion in ""other investments,"" which comprised 7% of Tether’s total assets.  What exactly are these investments? Did their value suffer in the generalized crypto price collapse of the last few months? Unfortunately, we don't know the answers to these questions because Tether doesn't disclose any information about its “other investments.”  Another less-than-stellar contribution to Tether’s Dec. 31 reserve report was the 10% invested in a combination of secured loans ($4.1 billion) and corporate bonds, funds and precious metals ($3.6 billion). Tether provides few details about the quality of these investments.  These are all questions a Tether owner will probably want more clarity on as they watch Tether meet the current round of redemptions. In its upcoming March 31 attestation report, which Tether should be publishing any day now, investors will be looking for some assurance on these issues.  So what would the perfect March 31 attestation report look like?  Ideally, between Dec. 31 and March 31, Tether will have shifted even more of its customers' funds into Treasury bills and cash. One hopes this movement into Treasury bills will have displaced riskier investments, particularly the murky ""other investments"" category. The safer Tether's assets were going into the Great Stablecoin Pullback of 2022, the more confidence investors can have that USDT’s peg will hold.  Investors will also want to know more about the quality of Tether’s more opaque investment categories. Without clarity, they could start to worry that Tether’s “other investments” or secured loans were impaired during the big drop in crypto prices. These worries, warranted or not, could ignite additional redemptions as Tether holders line up to get dibs on Tether's safest Treasury bill collateral.  In addition to the hoped-for improvements to Tether's investment quality, Tether needs to publish attestations on a more frequent basis in order to remove informational dry spells like the one investors currently find themselves in. Tether once boasted that it leads the industry on transparency. But it’s behind USDC on this front, which provides monthly reports.  Even better would be to copy competitor TrueUSD and go real-time. Can’t sleep on a Saturday night and want to see if your stablecoin is still well backed? TrueUSD provides 24/7 real-time attestations. Stablecoin owners shouldn't have to rely on information from 137 days ago to deal with breaking market conditions.  Let's hope that Tether's attestation comes out soon and dispels any worries. It remains the most important utility in the crypto economy. Everyone is watching.

42411456,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glO4gH,1652891481,Let Terra Die,"The scale of the human wreckage and pain inflicted by Do Kwon through the collapse of his fatally flawed Terra blockchain and reckless egotism continues to reveal itself. It is now clear that the promise of 20% returns on “stable” savings placed in the network’s Anchor protocol attracted scores of average people to pile in, with catastrophic results.  Those victims are understandably interested in plans to rebuild Terra, and, one hopes, to regain the value of the effectively worthless tokens they are left holding. Kwon’s blockchain was built around a stablecoin, UST, and a related free-floating cryptocurrency, LUNA, meant to keep the stablecoin algorithmically pegged at $1.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The battered Luna community is now debating plans to fork assets to a new chain and potentially redistribute the Terra team’s remaining treasury assets to “small” traders based on what they were holding on the old chain and when.  This distribution discussion is complicated and also a complete waste of time because there should be no reconstitution of Terra at all.  Certainly, Terra shouldn't be rebuilt by the team that developed such a flawed network in the first place. And even more certainly, Terra shouldn’t be rebuilt using money that by rights should be returned to the people who made the mistake of trusting Kwon in the first place.  See also: Do Kwon Is the Elizabeth Holmes of Crypto | Opinion  Luna holders seem to agree – over 90% of voters were against Kwon’s latest “recovery plan” (which seemed to have mostly left out the “plan” part).  We shall (not) arise  There are many, many reasons Terra should be left to die.  First and foremost, Terra shouldn’t be reconstituted because its stablecoin mechanism has already proven to be broken. Kwon himself has previously acknowledged that. In fact, one of the only technical or strategic elements of his restart proposal is decoupling UST from Luna.  But Kwon’s declaration on Monday that “Terra is more than UST” has got to be one of the more ridiculous and misleading statements yet from a man known for them. Terra isn’t more than UST: The “decentralized dollar” was the chain’s main purpose and reason for existing. Everything else was window dressing.  Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao agreed, and described an earlier proposal to fork and relaunch Luna as “wishful thinking.”  So removing UST from Terra will result in a chain with no real reason to exist and no real reason to hope for any kind of price recovery or stability. Kwon’s insistence that the Terra community is great is just a friendly way of saying, “I’ve got no ideas, let’s ask the audience.”  The second reason Terra shouldn’t be restarted is related to the first. With trust in leadership broken and no fundamental reason for existing, you can safely assume that the project’s new cryptocurrency would sell off aggressively as soon as it was launched (though the plan does include some lockups).  See also: UST's Do Kwon and the Human Cost of Lunatic Exuberance | Opinion  This could give insiders yet another chance to market holdings they know are fundamentally worthless and dump those holdings onto retail traders still high on a mix of hopium and despair. We’ve seen over the last few days that low-information speculators continue to buy the worthless LUNA token, and so there’s no reason to think they would stop on a new chain.  The final reason Luna shouldn’t be reconstituted is that Kwon shouldn’t continue to have a platform within the blockchain industry. He has proven himself both inept and toxic, and there is increasing evidence of explicitly deceptive behavior. That includes failing to disclose his work on a failed algorithmic stablecoin called basis cash and marketing materials that dramatically overstated UST’s stability.  We will learn a lot more about Kwon’s choices in the coming months and years, as we’re now seeing reports of a wave of civil and criminal proceedings launched against Kwon and Terraform Labs. Those proceedings could also lead to the only thing that might resemble justice here: taking real money from the pockets of Do Kwon and his collaborators and giving it back to the people they so dramatically failed.",NEGATIVE,LUNA,BLOCKCHAIN | LUNA | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,David Z.

They compete against one another to connect a series of transactions, known as blocks. All verified transactions are stored on the blockchain and available to all network participants.

42374699,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw209p,1652891381,"Block Sees Bitcoin Disrupting Payments Networks, Expects Self-Custody to Grow","Bitcoin has potential to disrupt existing traditional payment networks, especially with the growing adoption of the Lightning Network, executives from payments company Block (SQ) said during its virtual investor day Wednesday.  The Lightning Network provides a cheaper and faster way to process bitcoin transactions than directly on the Bitcoin blockchain.  “Bitcoin is going to have a profound impact on financial services, particularly as a tool for economic empowerment and as a global currency for the internet,” Block Chief Financial Officer Amrita Ahuja said during the presentation.  Block, which was formerly known as Square, is building integrated hardware and software to address self-custody with its wallet, along with a decentralized mining system. Jack Dorsey, its CEO, is a well-known proponent of Bitcoin.  “These initiatives are early in their development,” Ahuja said. “We intend to build out in the open.” She added that Block expects self-custody to be the “future of decentralized finance” as the process becomes easier for individuals.  With respect to mining, Ahuja said that bitcoin mining currently is “not conducive for consumers or small companies to participate” in, and Block wants to expand access to the field. Ahuja said Block’s mining initiative also seeks to add resilience and security to the bitcoin ecosystem.  Ahuja said that with its TBD initiative, Block wants to enhance and change how consumers and financial institutions interact, ranging from verifying indemnity to underwriting and transferring money globally. TBD is a decentralized exchange that Block is building.  Brian Grassadonia, Cash App's co-creator and lead, said that Bitcoin is a positive for Block as customers bring money into the overall ecosystem, with ""multiple opportunities for monetization."" In addition, given Block's network scale, Grassadonia believes Cash App can help bitcoin ""evolve beyond an asset class,"" and offer more transactional utility for individuals. Since bitcoin was incorporated into Cash App in 2018, the company has seen mover 10 million monthly active bitcoin users within its app, according to Grassadonia.  In the first quarter, Cash App, Block’s peer-to-peer payments service that allows users to directly buy and sell bitcoin, generated $1.73 billion in bitcoin transactions and $43 million of gross profit. Block also holds a significant amount of bitcoin on its balance sheet.  Bitcoin mining  Block is also trying to build out a mining platform as the current barriers to enter mining remain high, said Jesse Dorogusker, who leads bitcoin hardware and Blocks's streaming music service Tidal. Dorogusker said he sees mining as a potentially ""sizable"" business opportunity for Block.  Bitcoin mining systems are tough and pricey to acquire, while the manufacturing and sales of bitcoin ASICs are concentrated amongst a small group of companies, he noted.  Block wants to build its own bitcoin ASIC that will be optimized for cost, performance and smart system integration. Dorogusker said the custom ASIC will be part of any system Block builds, and that the company plans to make it available for sale to other developers.  Miners will store mined rewards in a bitcoin wallet, creating new opportunities for distribution and integration with Block’s bitcoin wallet or Cash App, he said.  Current mining systems also lack optimal clean energy use, Dorogusker added. He said he sees an opportunity to create a distributed mining cloud service that relies exclusively on clean energy.  “Addressing all of these shortcomings will create a more durable and decentralized Bitcoin ecosystem,” he said.

As a result, gaming is a popular activity for many in the modern age and remains one of the globe&apos;s most profitable industries. The first recognized example of a gaming machine debuted at the 1940 New York World&apos;s Fair and was based on the ancient game of Nim. Played by about 50,000 people, the computer won more than 90% of the time. In the mid-20th century, gaming was regarded as an oddity and primarily was just the subject of scientific and academic research projects. It was not until 1967 that the first prototype multiplayer video game system emerged. By 1972, the design turned into the Odyssey console that later inspired Atari&apos;s Pong video game. The 1990s finally brought the gaming industry to prominence. The rise of 3D gaming and successful franchises like Mortal Kombat and Sonic the Hedgehog cultivated generations of loyal gamers. Interest in gaming also established companies like Nintendo and Sony as household names. The Internet Revolution And The Rise Of Modern, Digital Gaming The rise of the internet and better computer processing power ushered in new gaming frontiers.

Argo was one of the first publicly traded crypto mining companies to form a non-mining business unit called “Argo Labs.” The subsidiary was created in January with a goal of diversifying Argo’s business and taking advantage of other opportunities in the blockchain ecosystem. Currently, Argo Lab’s investments include Polkadot's DOT, ether (ETH) and Solana's SOL, according to the company’s first-quarter presentation.  Argo was able to sell its UST positions at 93 cents per token before the price fully collapsed, according to Wall. Most recently, UST was still trading around 10 cents according to CoinDesk’s price index. “Looking back [selling at that level] was a very good move given last time I checked it was trading around 12 cents,” Wall said during the call. “Overall, on a net basis, in the Terra ecosystem, we nearly broke even on our positions, after taking into consideration the yield that we generated through our holdings,” he added.  Last week, Terra’s LUNA token fell 99.7% in value as the U.S. dollar-pegged algorithmic stablecoin terraUSD (UST) lost its peg and dropped to under 10 cents, causing an outflow in funds from the Terra ecosystem and declining sentiment for the project among the crypto community.  The collapse of the Terra ecosystem has taken a toll on numerous large-scale as well as retail investors. On social media and message boards, former LUNA backers have reported huge losses, despair and hopelessness.  Argo Blockchain reported its first-quarter earnings on Wednesday, in which its net income tumbled but revenue rose year over year, and it reiterated its hashrate guidance of 5.5 exahash per second (EH/s) by the end of 2022. The shares of the miner traded down about 4% in the U.S. on Wednesday, keeping pace with that of other publicly traded crypto miners.

42374696,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw204n,1652887076,Binance Seeking ‘Ideal Point’ for India Launch,"Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, is actively trying to ""find the ideal point for launching its local presence in India,"" a Binance spokesperson told CoinDesk in an email.  ""We are monitoring the changes in the local regulatory environment ... We are also in talks with different stakeholders to understand the market approach of the South Asia market in a compliant manner,"" the spokesperson added.  CoinDesk had posed the India question to Binance after multiple sources had indicated the company's hiring interest in the region.  A check of LinkedIn shows Binance actively seeking to fill these roles in India and South Asia: Head of Government Relations APAC, Regulatory Counsel APAC, Head of Acquisition, Executive Communications and Visibility Lead, Communications and PR Lead, PR Director APAC, Global Comms/PR manager and a Content Marketing Specialist.  Binance coming to India – a nation of 1.4 billion with more than 50% of the populace under the age of 30 – despite regulatory pressures such as the new tax law and the stifling of payment solutions – could be a major event for the crypto ecosystem.  ""Certainly user awareness and crypto adoption may receive a boost but it could backfire because Binance would have to disclose [know-your-customer information] of Indian retailers who may have used an Indian exchange to trade money on [the exchange],"" said Siddharth Sogani, founder and CEO of crypto research firm Crebaco.  The development comes after Coinbase (COIN), the world's third-largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, launched operations in India on April 7, only to exit three days later thanks to regulatory snags that disrupted nearly the entire industry.  Read more: UPI Was Central to Coinbase India Launch; Now the Crypto Exchange Says It's 'Unavailable'  FTX, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, has been exploring the feasibility of a launch in India but regulatory concerns have put things on hold for the moment, according to at least two people familiar with the matter.  Asked about its India vision in the near future, particularly after the struggles for Coinbase and FTX, the Binance spokesperson said India can be a major crypto participant. ""More than 10 crore (100 million) Indians own cryptocurrency according to industry reports, and we can tell that mass adoption of crypto is happening in India. With strong industry players on [the] ground, making investments in the country's industry, India can become one of the hubs for crypto industry,"" the spokesperson said.  According to policy specialists in India, neither Binance nor FTX are likely to come to India until the regulatory environment improves, particularly after Coinbase's troubled launch.  Vivan Sharan, a technology and policy expert who has worked with the government in the past, said global crypto exchanges could be great for India.  ""India [must not] view investments from global crypto-exchanges as a disruptive force,"" said Sharan. ""Rather, it should consider them an economic opportunity that can be harnessed through regulation. Exchanges are important nodes within Web 3, and can easily be nudged to help mitigate the types of risks that the crypto ecosystem is receiving flak for these days.""",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING | BNB,Amitoj Singh,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/05/18/binance-seeking-ideal-point-for-india-launch,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6ad71da40a3470fc43debe1de927e26c780388f4-2000x2500.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Having been investors in this space for more than a decade, it’s clear to us the industry has entered a new era, and there is no better time than now to build a fund focused on supporting the next generation of games builders,” wrote a16z team members Andrew Chen, Jonathan Lai, and James Gwertzman in a blog post.  The company said its fund, Games Company ONE, is “founded on the belief that games will play a pivotal role in defining how we socialize, play, and work over the next century.” It added that in the long term, it believes gaming infrastructure and technologies will be important building blocks of the Metaverse, an opportunity it says could be much bigger than the current $300 million game industry itself.  Among notable gaming industry investors in the fund are David Baszucki, founder of Roblox; Jason Citron, founder of Discord; Marc Merrill, co-founder of Riot Games; Mike Morhaime, co-founder of Blizzard; Aleks Larsen and Jeffrey Zirlin, co-founders of Sky Mavis; Kevin Lin, cofounder of Twitch; Mark Pincus, founder of Zynga; and Riccardo Zacconi, founder of King.  A16z isn’t a crypto native firm but has become one of the largest names in the space. Last summer, the firm allocated $2.2 billion for its third crypto fund, which was the largest crypto fund in history until Paradigm debuted its $2.5 billion vehicle in November.

42374707,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw20HN,1652880054,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Back Below $30K as Target's Earnings Miss Shows Effects of Inflation,"Good morning, and welcome to First Mover. I’m Brad Keoun, here to take you through the latest in crypto markets, news and insights. (Lyllah Ledesma is off this week.)  Price point: Bitcoin slid back below $30,000, in sync with U.S. stock futures after the giant retailer Target's latest earnings report provided a fresh glimpse of consumers adjusting spending habits because of inflation.  Market Moves: A day after the U.S. Federal Reserve chairman pledged to keep tightening monetary conditions until inflation comes down, analysts and traders from crypto to stocks and futures were assessing the economic impact – from higher mortgage rates to lower company earnings, Shaurya Malwa reports.  Feature: It's been a couple months since the $625 million Ronin Network exploit. Blockchain data shows the cryptocurrency haul moving onto Tornado, an on-chain privacy exchange that ostensibly would help to obscure the provenance.  Price Point  Bitcoin dipped to under $30,000 in European trading hours on Wednesday amid a retreat across traditional markets, as traders and analysts assessed the potential economic ramifications of U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's pledge Tuesday to keep tightening pressure on financial conditions until inflation shows signs of weakening.  Bitcoin's slide over the past few days is setting it up to extend a seven-week losing streak, which is the longest ever in a trading history that dates back to the early 2010s. The cryptocurrency has suffered from a downturn in broader markets, stricter crypto regulations, waning retail interest and systemic risks in the crypto sector.  Major cryptocurrencies followed bitcoin’s slide in the past 24 hours. Polkadot’s DOT lost as much as 6%, while avalanche (AVAX), bnb tokens (BNB), XRP and ether were all down. Tron (TRX) was among the few in the green buoyed by positive sentiment around its ecosystem stablecoin USDD.  In traditional markets, U.S. stocks were poised for declines on Wednesday based on the direction of futures trading, with weakness appearing as a disappointing earnings report from Target sent the giant retailer's shares plunging more than 22%.  Inflation is forcing consumers to spend more on food and less on discretionary items, MarketWatch reported.  Market Moves  By Shaurya Malwa  With bitcoin now regularly trading in sync with U.S. stocks, what happens in traditional markets and the bricks-and-mortar economy bleeds over to crypto.  Higher interest rates tend to hit the earnings of companies that borrow money to run their businesses. With rates on consumer loans such as mortgages also on the rise, households are left with lower disposable incomes, which in turn causes a ripple effect in the broader economy.  Although such scenarios could take months to play out, stock traders are already pricing in anticipated lower earnings, which lead to a drop in equity valuations. On Wednesday, S&P 500 futures dropped 0.4% while technology-heavy Nasdaq futures fell 0.6%. European markets showed nominal movement as Germany’s DAX rose less than 0.1% and the Stoxx 600 slid 0.1%.  Such market moves come after the Fed's Powell said Tuesday that the central bank remains committed to reducing inflation and could use “aggressive” measures to ensure a strong economy.  ""What we need to see is inflation coming down in a clear and convincing way and we're going to keep pushing until we see that,"" Powell said at a Wall Street Journal event. ""Achieving price stability, restoring price stability, is an unconditional need. Something we have to do because really the economy doesn't work for workers or for businesses or for anybody without price stability.”  Bitcoin has traded similarly to a risky technology stock in the past months, with correlations reaching almost 1:1 with the S&P 500. Some market observers suggest a further correction could take place if current market conditions continue.  “Markets have been expecting the hikes for some time now, and it looks like the expectations are already on the charts,” Anton Gulin, regional director at crypto exchange AAX, said in a Telegram message. “The movement of bitcoin and Nasdaq is rather correlated as well for a couple of months.""

Argo Blockchain Q1 Net Income Plunges 90% to $2.1M Bitcoin was priced in the $40,000 range for much of the first quarter, compared with nearly $60,000 in the same period a year earlier.  USDC Hasn’t ‘Flippened’ USDT, but Trader Preferences Are Changing A Glassnode analyst suggests the collapse of the UST token has triggered a change in investors' stablecoin preferences; bitcoin holds above $30,000.  Feature: Nearly 5,505 ETH, or $10M of the $625M Ronin Exploit, Is on the Move  By Shaurya Malwa  Addresses connected to Ronin Bridge’s $625 million exploit show upward of $10 million worth of ether was on the move during Asian morning hours on Wednesday, according to blockchain data.  One address was funded by the Ronin exploiter Wednesday morning for 5,505 ethers, with the funds coming in from another wallet that was directly funded by the main exploiter address, blockchain data shows.  Starting in the wee hours on Wednesday, the address sent ether in batches of 100 to Tornado, an on-chain privacy exchange. More than 55 transactions were made, the data shows.  Tornado enhances the privacy of transactions by breaking the on-chain link between a source and a destination address. That allows exploiters and hackers to mask their addresses while withdrawing illicitly gained funds.

Unfortunately, the attempt of buyers to start a new growth wave without a deep correction failed. Buyers were unable to maintain a critical mark of $1.8, although previous attempts by sellers to break this mark were deplorable. In the previous analysis, we repeatedly warned that you should not buy MANA until the price reaches the mark of $1.8. https://www.tradingview.com/x/pfOrNZ5O/ On the MANA weekly chart, we see that buyers tested the $1.8 mark so badly that the price fell to the $0.629 mark. Thus, the downward trend continues and now the mark of $1.8 is already a problem for buyers. Right next to this range is the main trendline of sellers, which they have been keeping since November 2021. What is the good news for MANA? The weekly candle of 9 May closed above the opening price, forming a giant pin. The trading volumes during this week increased. This is a signal from buyers to try to form a local growth wave. If sellers are not able to lower the price below the $0.95 mark during May, the chances of MANA starting to grow to the $1.8 mark will increase as much as possible. At the moment, this is our main scenario.

Lens Protocol opened on the Polygon blockchain mainnet Wednesday, Kulechov announced onstage at the Permissionless conference in Palm Beach, Florida. Built by Aave Companies, it allows developers to build their own decentralized social media networks in which users fully own their data.  “All [Web 3] innovation has been driven by the idea of ownership,” said Kulechov via Telegram. “Web 3 social ensures that users are in control of their content which makes the applications and algorithms compete on bringing the best experience layer to the users.”  The protocol was first announced in February, but today people can starting minting their profiles, an Aave spokesperson said, noting about 50 apps are already built on Lens.  Social graph protocols are popping up across the blockchain space to fight concerns about data ownership. Siloed data-buster CyberConnect said Tuesday it raised $15 million to build out its protocol. And Twitter founder Jack Dorsey has long backed efforts to experiment with decentralized social media concepts, too.  Aave’s Lens differs in its focus on non-fungible tokens (NFTs): each creator gets their own. These “profile” NFTs link to their followers and communities and interact with the 50+ platforms available at launch.  Aave has additionally launched a $250,000 grants program to fund projects seeking to build decentralized applications (dapps) on Lens.  Speaking at the Permissionless crypto event on Wednesday morning, Kulechov said Aave and Lens share the same ethos.  “We believe that the ownership of content and profiles should belong to you in the way that DeFi belongs to you,” he said.

42374705,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw20Er,1652877441,Do Kwon Pushes On-Chain Proposal Live Even as 92% Vote 'No' in Online Poll,"Terraform Labs founder Do Kwon on Wednesday morning announced an on-chain governance proposal even as results from a preliminary online poll on a hard fork plan found minimal backing among community members.  ""Terra governance prop #1623 to rename the existing network Terra Classic, LUNA Classic ($LUNC), and rebirth a new Terra blockchain & LUNA ($LUNA) is now live,"" Kwon tweeted. He added that the proposal had the support of over 15 ""Terra builders.""  A hard fork means the splitting of a chain on which a certain protocol runs with different rules than the existing one, resulting in two separate blockchains. One chain then becomes the “main” one, even as both the blockchains continue to exist as long as there is validator and community support.  As per the proposal, the new chain would entirely cut out the failed UST product and instead focus on decentralized finance (DeFi) applications building on Terra, as reported. The current chain would continue as Terra “Classic,” while holders of LUNA on the “Classic” chain would receive a token airdrop of the new chain’s token under the plan.  At writing time, some 64% of voters on the on-chain proposal supported the fork, while 34% voted against it.  The community, however, is apparently not on board. Some 92% of over 6,220 voters on a previously held online poll have voted against the change, with the most popular responses calling for “no fork.”  Votes to the off-chain, online poll can be made by anyone regardless of if they hold luna (LUNA) tokens, unlike on-chain governance polls that require voters to stake luna before casting votes. Most comments on the proposal’s discussion are negative. Some even term it “anti-community,” while others urged legal intervention.  Why are most voting no?  Market observers say a lack of trust in Terra and Kwon could have skewed the online preliminary poll voting towards being overwhelmingly negative.  “The primary challenge the Terra community has against a new fork as proposed by Do Kwon is trust,” said Dmitry Mishunin, founder of DeFi security firm HashEx, in a Telegram chat. ""Should the team choose to proceed with the new fork, there will be a need to increase trust.”  “As such, Terra needs to approach the fork with all responsibility and make additional checks for vulnerabilities,” Mishunin added.  Anton Gulin, a regional director at crypto exchange AAX, seconded the comment: “The overall sentiment towards Luna across the crypto community is exceptionally harmful. Traders and investors suffered tremendous losses and doubt management’s actions that followed the UST unpegging.”  “Anything incoming from Luna’s team may be treated in the same way as the lack of trust prevails. It’s rather a speculative asset now than a representation of a tier 1 ecosystem. The chances of a consensus are very low,” Gulin added.  Meanwhile, some prominent fund managers say Terra’s senior team could fork the blockchain regardless of the community’s sentiment toward the project.  “It's a dilemma for Kwon and Terra’s team as they can technically override the community's consensus by either forking regardless of the decision or using their staked Luna (to prevent the network from being manipulated) to change the voting to support,” Doo Wan Nam, founder of crypto fund Stable Node, in a Telegram chat.  “This will be received very poorly by not only the Terra community but the wider crypto community. However, Do and his team might not have much choice but to do it to better reflect his vision of the Terra ecosystem,” Doo added.  Although still a proposal, if a majority of network validators and the community were to approve the plan, the new network could be launched as soon as May 27, Kwon said in tweets earlier this week.  Last week, Terra’s LUNA tokens fell 99.7% as its U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin terraUSD (UST) lost its peg and dropped to under 10 cents, causing an outflow of funds from the Terra ecosystem and declining sentiment for the project among the crypto community.",NEGATIVE,LUNC,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | LUNC | AIRDROP | FORKS,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/05/18/do-kwon-pushes-on-chain-proposal-live-even-as-92-vote-no-in-online-poll,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a604932aa05a827543a02a98c4e9d227ba6c756d-3267x2450.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42374708,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw20L9,1652875268,"Bitcoin, Major Cryptos Slide as Markets Digest Hawkish Powell Remarks","Bitcoin (BTC) dipped under $30,000 in European hours on Wednesday, amid a retreat across traditional markets, as traders and analysts assessed the potential economic ramifications of U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's pledge Tuesday to keep tightening pressure on financial conditions until inflation shows signs of weakening.  Bitcoin's slide over the past few days is setting it up to extend a seven-week losing streak, already the longest in a trading history that dates back to the early 2010s. The cryptocurrency has suffered from a downturn in broader markets, stricter crypto regulations, waning retail interest and systemic risks in the crypto sector.  Major cryptocurrencies followed bitcoin’s slide in the past 24 hours. Polkadot’s DOT lost as much as 6%, while avalanche (AVAX), bnb tokens (BNB), XRP, and ether lost 2.2%. Tron (TRX) was among the few in the green buoyed by positive sentiment around its ecosystem stablecoin USDD.  Powell said Tuesday that the Fed remained committed to reducing inflation concerns and could use “aggressive” measures to ensure a strong economy.  ""What we need to see is inflation coming down in a clear and convincing way, and we're going to keep pushing until we see that,"" Powell said at a Wall Street Journal event. ""Achieving price stability, restoring price stability, is an unconditional need. Something we have to do because really the economy doesn't work for workers or for businesses or for anybody without price stability.”  “It's the bedrock of the economy really,” Powell added. The Fed has previously vowed to keep inflation in check as it tightens balance sheets following nearly two years of unprecedented stimulus to help an ailing economy amid the-then ill effects of the coronavirus pandemic.  Powell acknowledged controlling inflation might cause slower economic growth or higher unemployment, but added price hikes would be done in a manner that would prevent a recession.  However, if inflation still failed to go down, Powell said rates would be hiked until it does.  ""We will go until we feel we are at a place where we can say, 'Yes, financial conditions are at an appropriate place, we see inflation coming down,'” Powell said.  Why do higher rates affect markets?  Higher rates tend to negatively affect company earnings because companies borrow money to run their businesses. With rates on consumer loans, such as mortgages, also on the rise, households are additionally left with lower disposable incomes, which in turn causes a ripple effect in the broader economy.  Businesses are hence affected by both a higher cost to borrow money and lower consumer spending.  While such scenarios take months to play out, traders price in changes anticipating lower earnings, which leads to a drop in equity valuations. On Wednesday, for example, U.S. futures on S&P 500 dropped 0.4% while the technology-heavy Nasdaq dropped 0.6%. European markets showed nominal movement as Germany’s DAX rose less than 0.1% while the Stoxx 600 slid 0.1%.  Bitcoin has traded similarly to a risky technology stock in the past months, with correlations reaching almost 1:1 with the S&P 500. Some market observers suggest a further correction could take place if current market conditions continue.  “Markets have been expecting the hikes for some time now and it looks like the expectations are already on the charts,” said Anton Gulin, regional director at crypto exchange AAX, in a Telegram message.“The movement of bitcoin and Nasdaq is rather correlated as well for a couple of months.”",NEGATIVE,AVAX | BTC | DOT,AVAX | BTC | DOT | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/05/18/bitcoin-major-cryptos-slide-as-markets-digest-hawkish-powell-remarks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3f682b1dfe147dd41ef8b9286c2e9e4b4376befe-4000x2667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42393836,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpBcWL,1652873400,Will a Proof-of-Stake Ethereum Lead to More Centralization?,"Lido is the most-used liquid staking protocol, commanding a whopping one-third share of total ETH staked on the Beacon Chain, Ethereum’s proof-of-stake blockchain, according to data from Nansen and Etherscan.  This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum 2.0 and its sweeping impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to Valid Points here.  When Ethereum eventually shifts from its current proof-of-work method to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, it will rely on validators rather than on miners to validate transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. In order to run a validator and earn staking rewards, participants must stake 32 ETH, which is worth roughly $65,800 at current prices.  Lido is a staking-as-a-service provider that allows users to deposit any amount of ETH to earn staking rewards on the Beacon Chain. With Lido, users bypass the requirement of needing the full 32 ETH deposit to run a validator node and aren’t responsible for the technical maintenance required to manage a staking node .  In return for accepting ETH deposits, Lido issues stakers stETH, its derivative token that “represents staked ether in Lido, combining the value of initial deposit + staking rewards,” according to Lido. Lido stakers can hold their stETH, sell it on the open market or deposit their stETH in different DeFi (decentralized finance) platforms, including Curve, Aave and 1inch, to earn additional yield.  This access to liquidity is attractive to some stakers who want to be able to access their staked ETH ahead of the Merge; otherwise, they wouldn’t be able to touch any of that staked ETH (or any rewards they might have earned in the meantime) until after that point, which won’t happen till later this year.  At the present time, 10.6% of the circulating supply of ether is staked in the Ethereum Beacon Chain, which is just under $26.4 billion or 12.6 million ETH.  Of the 12.6 million ETH staked, roughly 4.2 million has been staked through Lido by 73,369 stakers, making Lido the most used staking pool on Ethereum.  Lido, Coinbase, Kraken and Binance, the four largest validator node operators on Ethereum’s PoS Beacon Chain, have amassed a 54% share of all ETH staking activity, according to Nansen. Lido’s dominance, by virtue of controlling roughly 33% of total ETH staked on Ethereum’s PoS blockchain, has raised centralization worries in relation to Ethereum’s long-term health and security.  While there are more than 70,000 stakers, Lido has 22 Ethereum node operators who handle the technical side of running validator node software. Moreover, it doesn’t help that the top 100 holders of LDO, the governance token for the Lido DAO, possess 93.1% of the entire LDO supply, according to data from Etherscan.  The issue of Lido's concentration of staked ether was highlighted by Danny Ryan, lead researcher at the Ethereum Foundation, on Twitter: “Lido passing ⅓ is a centralization attack on PoS,” he tweeted.  By controlling a significant chunk of staked ether and assuming more than 90% of the liquid staking market, Lido’s centralization issue increases the risk of undesirable events such as validator slashing, governance attacks and smart contract exploits.  On the other hand, in the lead-up to Ethereum’s decision to switch to proof-of-stake, there were concerns that centralized exchanges such as Coinbase would take over the lion’s share of staking pools. Lido was in itself created as an alternative to these centralized juggernauts. That it has outpaced Coinbase, Kraken and Binance could be seen as an encouraging sign that the ecosystem will be able to maintain a measure of decentralization in the future.

Validated takes  Portugal plans to impose taxes on the exchange and sale of cryptocurrencies.  WHY IT MATTERS: Portugal was previously considered a tax haven for cryptocurrency investors, but Finance Minister Fernando Medina indicated that cryptocurrencies will be subject to taxation. The new policy doesn’t detail how staking or yield farming will be affected, but there will be a capital gains tax. “Many countries already have systems, many countries are building their models in relation to this subject and we will build our own,” Medina said.

One address was funded by the Ronin exploiter this morning for 5,505 ether, with the funds coming in from another wallet that was directly funded by the main exploiter address, blockchain data shows.  Starting in the wee hours on Wednesday, the address sent ether in batches of 100 to Tornado, an on-chain privacy exchange. Over 55 transactions were made, the data shows.  The wallet contains just 3.4 ether – valued at over $7,000 – at writing time, suggesting most of the funds were transferred to Tornado and sold.  Tornado enhances the privacy of transactions by breaking the on-chain link between a source and a destination address. This allows exploiters and hackers to mask their addresses while withdrawing illicitly gained funds.  Wednesday’s moves follow the aggressive selling of stolen ether in early April, when the exploiters moved as much as 21,000 ether over several transactions to Tornado. The stash was valued at over $65 million at the time.  Ronin Network was hit by a $625 million exploit in March that affected Ronin validator nodes for Sky Mavis, the publisher of the popular Axie Infinity game, and the Axie decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). The attacker “used hacked private keys in order to forge fake withdrawals,” Ronin said in a blog post at the time, explaining the exploit.  U.S. officials have previously tied the exploiter address to North Korea’s infamous “Lazarus” group.

Then, after decades of sending bits in increasingly larger chunks, some people began to wonder if we could do better. Maybe there&apos;s something we can do to make things a little better? Some believe that the term Web3 is the answer. But unfortunately, there is no official committee, and everyone has their interpretation of what these four letters mean. Still, the goal is the same: to find a way to bring the certainty and security of cryptocurrencies to the rest of the internet. Why Should We Trust Web3? There are different reasons why we should put our trust in Web3. The reasons are as follows: Decentralized control helps everyone One of the original goals of the Internet was to create a network that was not controlled by a single entity. Web3 supports this notion and believes that no single person or group should be in charge of transactions. This decentralized and shared control concept can be applied to all aspects of the market and daily life. Of course, some may think it&apos;s silly to be concerned about power and control over some of the least important parts of the Internet.
