276203,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=496490,1658532313,Blue Chip NFTs 101: Art Blocks Does It Differently And Frequently,"Unlike other NFT collections, Art Blocks is a platform. Its focus is generative or algorithmic artworks. The artists create the style of the collection, the colors and forms, or the “blocks” if you will. Each mint sorts through endless possibilities to create a unique piece. At minting time, the customer interacts with a generative script and the result is a randomly generated, unpredictable work of art. Depending on the collection, the resulting NFT can go from a static image to a multimedia experience. In most of the other Blue Chip collections, like World Of Women or Doodles, an artist or a group of artists create the art and its different traits. In contrast, multiple artists constantly build Art Blocks collections. As you might imagine, some of them are more valuable than others. The platform’s creator is Erick Calderon, better known as Snowfro. He’s the artist and coder behind Art Block’s first and flagship collection, Chromie Squiggle. You’ve probably seen them around, and one of the squiggles serves as the logo for the whole platform. Other iconic and multi-million dollar collections launched through the platform are Fidenza by Tyler Hobbs and Dmitri Cherniak’s Ringers. Of course, those are the stand-out, incredibly successful ones. New collections and projects launch through Art Blocks every week, as you can see in this very busy calendar. To avoid gas wars at minting time, the platform uses the Dutch Auction method. That is, the sale starts at a high price that lowers as time goes by. The clients wait for their ideal price, if it ever gets there. How Does Art Blocks Work? So far, the platform has generated $277M in primary sales and a whopping $1320M in secondary ones. The platform royalties are 10% for primary and 2.5% for secondary market sales. From primaries, there’s a mandatory 25% donation to the artist’s favorite charity. Which is interesting, but wow, 25%! The artist receives a fair 5% for each secondary resale. According to Art Block’s website, they offer “genuinely programmable on demand generative content that is stored immutably on the Ethereum Blockchain.” That’s not entirely true. The script and the NFTs are there, presumably forever, but the art is too complex to be stored on-chain. The files are in IPFS or other storage solutions. Art Blocks also claims that “collectors actively participate in realizing an artist’s vision by generating unique algorithmic artworks,” which is debatable. The mind-blowing thing is that an Art Blocks holder with access to the script and Ethereum’s ledger could theoretically reproduce the NFT. So, technically, everything they claim is true. Even though Art Blocks is a platform, it’s not open to everyone. A team curates the collections and selects the artists worthy of participating. They offer three tiers of collections, each with different characteristics. Let’s look into them. ETH price chart for 07/22/2022 on Kraken | Source: ETH/USD on TradingView.com The Different Collections The Curated Collection: This is the main one, Art Blocks releases it “on a regular schedule.” Only a few selected artists have made it to the seven quarterly series so far. According to their website, “Art Blocks established a curation board to carefully select projects for inclusion in our Curated Collection. The Curated Collection is a group of projects that push the boundaries of Generative Art in their technical innovation and aesthetic beauty.” The company’s account executive, Druid, expanded on the collections’ characteristics in a Medium post. “Since we launched Art Blocks in November of 2020, our first official set includes all Curated drops in 2020, with full quarterly sets beginning in 2021. Artists have a six-month cooldown between deploying projects in the Curated Collection.” Playground Collection: This one is less formal, “Art Blocks artists who have been previously included in the Curated Collection” can play around and do what they want. Druid expands, “It’s important to note the Playground’s limitations: first, an artist can only launch a Playground project after a Curated project. Second, only one project per artist can be active in the Playground at once, and it must be completed before another can be launched on the Playground.” Also, there’s “a two-month cooldown between deploying projects in the Playground Collection.” Art Blocks Factory: This is more general and it’s for artists that don’t necessarily have participated in The Curated Collection. According to the website, “The Factory Collection includes projects selected directly by Art Blocks and highlights our standards for technical quality and artistic beauty.” And according to Druid, “Factory artists will be required to sell out their entire project before releasing anything else on the platform. They also will have a two-month cool down between projects on the platform.” Powered by Art Blocks (PBAB) Last but not least, the company offers this very interesting product. “Powered by Art Blocks (PBAB) is a custom branded solution from Art Blocks. It allows the generative NFT minting technology used by artists at Art Blocks to be integrated with third-party sites”. That means that organizations can use Art Blocks’ “smart contracts and rendering infrastructure” to generate “branded generative projects.” PBAB could be huge in the future. Keep your eye on it.

I estimate ETH has a 70% chance of dropping by 80%. Confluence of factors point to this (RSI / price divergence, more than 68% retracement, rising volume on price drop, resistance levels). Ethereum (ETH-USD), for the uninitiated, is the second-most important of the crypto currencies, Second only to Bitcoin (BTC-USD) by market value and role, Ethereum is the main currency dominating the $100 billion industry of Decentralized Finance (see CoinDesk ). Before I launch into my technical analysis, the reader may want to know my biases: I confess I'm one of the Kool-Aid drinkers who believe that cryptos will be at the foundation of our economic system a decade or so from now. I believe that Bitcoin will function as the future hard-currency savings instrument (similar to Gold until now), while ETH will largely play the role the dollar does today. It will be the preferred currency for international transactions. Over the next decade, I have not doubt that both Bitcoin and Ethereum will flourish and be worth 20 to 50 times their current prices. So I guess you could call me a crypto bull or - less generously - a crypto fool. Despite that, I exited all but a small portion of my crypto holdings last January. I thought the Fed's changing stance on inflation would cause a market rout where all assets would drop. Crypto assets, having been priced in a market of real negative interest rates, would be hit the hardest. I was a bit late, but I avoided most of the ensuing plunge. I know that soon enough, the Fed is likely to stop tightening. It is more a matter of months, than years, I believe. At some point it will start reinflating again. When that happens, I'm convinced that fundamental factors will propel both ETH and BTC to heretofore unattained highs. My reasoning is beyond the scope of this article, but the gist is that we're witnessing the last throes of a dying global monetary system that has proved its inadequacy. This is becoming more and more obvious to more and more people around the world. I want to be ready for that reinflation. But when is the right moment? So now I'll pull out my crystal ball and astrological charts. Well at least the financial versions of those. I mean of course technical analysis. Let's see what the crypto future holds. When I started my professional career in finance, I thought logic would rule. management studies, product and service comparisons, spreadsheets, cash flows and the like. I quickly - and rather painfully for my earnings - discovered that mass psychology was more important in the near and mid-term. In a nutshell, technical analysis is taking the pulse of mass investor psychology. It is assessing the degree of madness of crowds: the fear and greed that move us to buy and sell assets. Wait, you might say. Do resistance levels, Fibonacci measurements, RSI - price divergences, etc. really work? Aren't we just drawing random lines on a chart in the hope of discovering some obscure relationships that just are not there ? My conclusion after more than 14 years of trial and error: technical analysis works the majority of the time . It's difficult to do right, and easy to misinterpret. But with all that said, technical analysis can give you a valuable edge. I put that edge at about 70%. That ain't so bad. Let's take Fibonacci levels, for example. Why should they even work? Is it because our senses succumb to an innate sense of proportionality? Is it really because ""on the molecular level, the nucleotide spirals of human DNA have Fibonacci proportions""? ( source: Fibonacci in Humans) Hmm. Until I measure the angstroms of human DNA under a microscope for myself (probably not happening any time soon) , I'll reserve judgement. Meanwhile though, them darn Fibonacci levels sure have an uncanny way of hitting the mark time and again with surprising accuracy. And of course, some times they just don't. My theory on Fibonacci measurements: the relation of investing to biology is probably hogwash. But so many stock pickers think Fibonacci levels should work and so they start their buying and selling based on those magical proportions. So Fibonaccis are kind of like a set of admittedly bogus rules that most investors choose to follow. So they become self-fulfilling. It's good to know where the crowd is going. Ok, having gotten that out of the way, let me plunge into Ethereum's longer term chart. The chart above allows you to see on one chart the price action and a 50- and 100-week RSI indicator. (More on this below). The second chart is a zoomed version of the first, but only includes the price action. This makes it easier to read and follow along. ETH full sized technical weekly candle chart (stockcharts.com) ETH price only weekly candles (stockcharts.com) Take a look at the RSI chart with the 100 period moving average. Please note that if you trace the RSI highs from March to Nov of 2021, you get a downward sloping line (grey dotted arrow line). During the same period, the price highs was making higher highs. This is known as bearish divergence. It is very often a sign of a reversal from an upward trend to a downward trend. So by late May, when ETH made a lower high, it was clear that the slope of the 100 period RSI was negative, and a new negative trend was starting. At this point, with ETH trading at $2230, you could look for the lowest price reached between March 21 and May 22 and conclude that the price would drop to at least that low, namely $1720. This conclusion is not taught in many RSI discussions, but is my own learning from heavy use of this indicator over many years. But by the time it got down to $1720 on May 16 2022, the RSI100 level traced over to an even lower point on the time scale, namely that of July 2020. At that point ETH was at a price of around $300. This suggests that the RSI ""wants"" the price to revisit that level. Let's call that clue #1. (Note if you ever attempt RSI tracing, you must make sure the period you trace back to does not exceed the calendar comparison validity: e.g. a 14 period RSI only can be compared to prices 14 weeks back, and so on.) This RSI tracing level is interesting, but not enough to go on, so I look for confirmation in other patterns. Look at the price lows made by both price and RSI (dotted red line). We're still getting lower lows and lower highs. As price is making lower lows, so is the RSI tracing lower lows. It is in a convergent downtrend. Call that clue #2. Now look at the two red elliptical curves drawn representing two possible bearish price waves, one already having occurred, the other one drawn using a Fibonacci-based mirroring of the first. (My ellipses only trace the extremes, not the curling of the wave regression.) The first red wave down was formed when the price dropped from $4866 to $2160, then back up to $3311. When this wave was breached to the downside (9th May 22) on better than average volume, this was critical. It meant there was a greater than 90% chance that a second downward wave would ensue, proportional to the first. That's a low of $322. Let's call that clue #3. If you want to know where I get that 90% stat, read the italicized section, otherwise skip this explanation. Take a look at the following chart, which is an idealized version of how Fibonacci waves are supposed to evolve. Idealized Fibonacci Wave Cycle (Elliotwave Plus) Note that wave 3's are always a 68% projection of distance from origin to wave 1, and wave C's are always a 68% projection of distance from start of wave to wave A low, projected down. So even if you've misinterpreted the direction of the dominant trend (whether up or down), since you've just breached the first defined wave from the last base, you know you're in the either in a wave C of an otherwise bullish uptrend or in a wave 3 of a bearish downtrend that will have a wave 4 and a wave 5. Either way, you can count on that 68% projection further in the direction of the wave that was just breached. If your interpretations of the charts was always accurate, you'd be able to count with a 100% success rate - according to Fibonacci theory anyways. But either Fibonacci theory is a decent but imprecise way of measuring equity movements or my charting skills are deficient. In viewing hundreds of thousand of charts over the last 14 years, I've only succeed with these projections (on first wave breaches mind you) around 90% of the time. About 10% of th e projected wave stop short of that 68%. In the orange box on the chart, you'll see the math behind the $322 calculation. Remember, according to Fibonacci theory, this is the minimum low, not the maximum low. The price could go even lower than $322. Another chartist might look at volume and pivot points and suggests the drop could stop at $662 or $460 levels. I think those two will be bounce points, temporary floors, but the downtrend will then continue, until we get my Fibo projection of $322. That would then satisfy the mirroring pattern. So if ETH does drop to $322, could it not go even lower? Maybe to the RSI tracing level mentioned in clue #1 of $300? Yes that could easily happen. Note the pivot points formed on large volume in June-July 2019 and Feb 2020 highs and Sep-Oct 2021 lows. These form a broad resistance floor that is likely to halt any further drops. Call that clue #4. Many people have called the crypto run a bubble. I would agree. The mania surrounding all things crypto in the last two years had many bubblish aspects. Well, the vast majorities of bubbles return to the base point from which they first erupted. In the case of ETH, that would be to the base price of $129, reached in March of 2020. That would be a 100% drop of value since that period. Is that possible? Of course, anything is possible. But is it likely? I don't think so. But if ETH gets down to my expected low of $322, I'll take another look. The chart will have evolved by then, and it may then suggest even lower lows. So in conclusion, my technical analysis suggests that ETH must drop from its present levels of $1522, to a level of $322. That's a portfolio-crushing 80%. And that prognosis comes from a die-hard believer in the future of crypto.

42393802,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpBLj9,1658527229,Failed Crypto Lender Cred Blames Its Demise on Uphold Exchange in Suit,"The liquidation trust for cryptocurrency lender Cred sued Uphold Friday, alleging the crypto exchange masterminded the product that ultimately caused Cred to seek bankruptcy protection in 2020.  That product, CredEarn, offered retail investors high yields until the investments Cred made with depositor money soured.  Sound familiar?  Read more: Bad Loans, Bad Bets, Bad Blood: How Crypto Lender Cred Really Went Bankrupt  Although not as high in profile, Cred’s bankruptcy case holds a number of parallels to those of Celsius Network and Voyager Digital, two crypto investment platforms that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection this month. The drama surrounding Cred’s bankruptcy – who is to blame, whether and how depositors are to be repaid – may provide insight into how these more recent cases could play out.  The Cred case is also a reminder that centralized financial intermediaries have been drawing investors into the ""decentralized” world of cryptocurrency for years through flashy marketing and seemingly too-good-to-be-true promises of high interest rates. These past few months are not the first time the risks of what one might call CeDeFi – centralized decentralized finance – have been laid bare for consumers (and regulators) to see.  Cred’s liquidators are seeking at least $783 million in damages in the case filed in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware.  Uphold lawsuit  According to Cred Inc. Liquidation Trust, Cred and Uphold jointly created and promoted CredEarn, through which Cred loaned out more than $100 million in customer deposits before failing in 2020.  At the cryptocurrency market’s peak, those crypto investments – a majority of which were funneled to the lender through Uphold’s exchange – would have been worth upwards of $700 million, according to the suit.  The suit alleges that ‘“Uphold drove thousands of retail customers to lend cryptocurrency to the CredEarn program by falsely marketing it as ‘safe,’ ‘secured,’ ‘insured,’ and ‘fully hedged.’”  As evidence, the Cred Liquidation Trust points out that Cred’s founder, Dan Schatt, was a member of Uphold’s Board of Directors. The suit also claims CredEarn was at one time supposed to be called UpholdEarn. It was renamed, says the suit, to avoid regulatory risk.  “Uphold knew that Cred was implementing a highly risky hedging strategy, and that there was regulatory risk associated with cryptocurrency yield earning programs,” reads the suit. “Rather than take on all of these risks, Uphold and Schatt decided to shift the risks away from Uphold by running [‘Earn’] through Cred.”  Uphold disputed the claims made in the lawsuit. Uphold insisted that Cred was owned and operated completely independently, and it said it was unaware of CredEarn’s financial troubles when it promoted the product to Uphold customers.  “Cred was a third-party company over which Uphold had no control,"" said Simon McLoughlin, Uphold's CEO. ""We, like their other partners, were kept completely in the dark about the true state of affairs at the company until it was too late. Our trust was betrayed.”  In an email to CoinDesk, Dan Schatt said: ""I was an unpaid Board Member at Uphold with no equity or other renumeration. I was invited to Uphold’s board based on my expertise as a published author in financial technology and experience at PayPal. I left the Board in October 2020."" (Uphold claims Schatt was removed from the board.)  Parallels with Celsius  Cred was similar in many ways to Celsius, the crypto lending firm (and one-time Cred competitor) that filed for bankruptcy this month after promising market-leading returns to depositors in exchange for their investments. To maintain these high yields, Cred and Celsius both re-invested customer money behind the scenes. They used the interest from these investments to pay back depositors and shaved off a fee for themselves.  Customers’ funds were on the line when these investments went sour.  In Cred’s case, Friday’s lawsuit notes that more than 90% of the cryptocurrency that Uphold’s customers lent to Cred was in turn loaned out to MoKredit – a Chinese micro-lending firm. As CoinDesk reported at the time, CredEarn ran into trouble when MoKredit was no longer able to pay back its loans.  Celsius’s failure stemmed, in part, from a loan it made to Three Arrows Capital – a major crypto hedge fund that filed for bankruptcy in July. Celsius was also heavily invested in Terra, the stablecoin ecosystem that collapsed in May and set off the wider crypto crash.  It remains unclear in either Cred’s or Celsius’ case whether depositors will be able to claw back any of their money.  Parallels with Voyager  In addition to Celsius, the Cred saga shares similarities to Voyager – another crypto exchange that filed for bankruptcy this month. In all three cases, questions swirl around whether customers were given false assurances about the safety of their deposits.  Voyager has been on the receiving end of criticism that it misleadingly implied customer deposits were insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.. The bank where Voyager held customer U.S. dollar deposits was insured. Voyager itself was not. The claims have sparked an FDIC probe, as well as angry posts on Voyager’s Reddit page from customers surprised by the inability to withdraw their funds.  According to Friday’s lawsuit, Cred customers were similarly misled by marketing suggesting that their investments were insured:  “A joint press release between Uphold and Cred falsely stated that Cred was a licensed lender with ‘comprehensive insurance’ … both Cred and Uphold approved of and disseminated other marketing materials that also falsely asserted that Cred had ‘comprehensive insurance and security policies to protect your digital assets and your data… All of these statements concerning Cred’s insurance were false.’”  According to the Cred Liquidation Trust, “Cred maintained a small amount of basic business insurance … [but] the CredEarn and CredBorrow programs were not insured.”  UPDATE (July 25 15:28 UTC): Added a statement from former Dan Schatt, the former CEO of Cred.

272783,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4525258-hive-red-flags-in-quarterly-release?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,1658525976,HIVE: Red Flags In Quarterly Release,"HIVE is a crypto miner with mining assets in Canada, Sweden, and Iceland. At current BTC and ETH prices, HIVE appears to be mining at negative gross margins. HIVE is the most exposed to Ethereum, which is transitioning to Proof-of-Stake in the next few months and could make mining equipment obsolete. HIVE Blockchain Technologies Ltd. ( HIVE ) stock rose almost 8% on the back of its recently released Q4/2022 earnings . I find the reaction puzzling as I found the earnings report to be negative, while the stock reacted very positively. Of course this could simply be because I'm an old dinosaur and I just don't ""get"" the crypto story. But below, I'll highlight some of the red flags I saw from HIVE's earnings report and business in general. Mining At Negative Gross Margin? HIVE reported record $211 million in revenues and $79 million in earnings for fiscal 2022, and a 545% growth in BTC mining hashrate. All fine and good, what's the issue? The issue I have is the quarterly progression, especially in the mining margins. HIVE has a March year-end, so it's Q4 is the calendar quarter ended March 31, 2022. Figure 1 is reproduced from the company's Q4 MD&A report. Figure 1 - HIVE quarterly earnings (HIVE Q4/2022 MD&A) Notice HIVE's Q4 Gross Mining Margin was 46%. HIVE defines Gross Mining Margin as: The Gross mining margin is defined as revenue less direct cash costs, being operating and maintenance costs. In other words, it's revenues from selling 'mined' coins less the power it costs to operate the mining equipment. What's wrong with a 46% margin? Figure 2 and 3 shows the monthly average Ethereum and Bitcoin prices. Notice for HIVE's Q4, Ethereum prices averaged $2,933 while Bitcoin prices averaged $41,281. Figure 2 - Monthly Ethereum Statistics (HIVE Q4/2022 MD&A) Figure 3 - Monthly Bitcoin statistics (HIVE Q4/2022 MD&A) If Gross Mining Margin was only 46% when Bitcoin and Ethereum prices were $41k and $2.9k respectively, what would margins be at current prices? As of today's close, Bitcoin and Ethereum were approximately $23.5k and $1.5k, or 57% and 52% of the average Q4 realized price. Even if hashrates and difficulty were kept the same, HIVE would be mining coins at zero gross mining margin! Unfortunately, that's not all. According to data from blockchain.com , Bitcoin difficult has gone up since March (Figure 4), so HIVE could be mining Bitcoins at negative gross margins. Figure 4 - Bitcoin difficult has continued to rise (Blockchain.com) Fortunately for HIVE, Ethereum difficulty has gone down to roughly December 2021 levels, so perhaps HIVE can mine Ethereum at a small positive gross mining margin (Figure 5). Figure 5 - Ethereum difficulty has gone down (Ethereum.io) Mining Equipment Obsolescence An Issue Furthermore, in Figure 1, HIVE already tells the reader it is mining at a negative gross margin of -25% in Q4, after factoring in depreciation. Unlike traditional mining where mining equipment has relatively long useful lives, crypto mining relies on specialized ASICS and GPUs that become obsolete very quickly. HIVE depreciates its data center mining equipment on a straight line schedule over 2 to 4 years and includes it when calculating Gross Margin. What is especially interesting with this earnings report is the QoQ jump in depreciation expense from $15 million in Q3 to $35.5 million in Q4. The MD&A was not very helpful, as it only said: Depreciation for the quarter of $35.5 million related to the Company’s data centre equipment and right of use assets. But if we go through the notes to the financial statements in Figure 6 and 7, we can see that HIVE added $106 million in equipment and buildings ($94 million in data centre equipment and $12 million in buildings), and depreciated $35.5 million in the Q4 quarter. As the depreciation amount is much higher than what a straight line depreciation over 2 to 4 years would suggest (Even if the $94 million in data centre additions were depreciated over 2 years, it should only add $11.8 million to depreciation expense, QoQ, not $20.5 million), one has to assume some older mining equipment was 'written off' as it could not mine profitably. With the subsequent plunge in crypto prices since March, will more of the mining equipment have to be 'written off' in coming quarters? Figure 6 - HIVE Q3/2022 Data Centre Equipment Balance (HIVE Q3/2022 Financial Report) Figure 7 - HIVE Q4/2022 Data Centre Equipment Balance (HIVE Q4/2022 Financial Report) Ethereum Mining Days Are Numbered Perhaps the biggest red flag against investing in HIVE is that Ethereum is moving away from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake , with some analysts expecting the event to occur between August to November. Already, crypto miners have been flooding the secondhand markets with GPUs as they try to recoup some of their investments. How much of HIVE's cryptomining equipment will become obsolete overnight with Ethereum's transition to Proof-of-Stake? If we look at HIVE versus its cryptomining competitors, HIVE appears to have the most exposure to Ethereum, as approximately 56% of its coins 'production' in calendar 2021 were ETH, while peers predominantly only mine BTC (Figure 8, HUT8 does mine ETH, but the split is less than 20% and is received as BTC). Figure 8 - HIVE has high exposure to ETH (HIVE investor presentation) Will HIVE investors be left holding the figurative bag when Ethereum transitions to Proof-of-Stake later this year? Risks To Bearish View The biggest risk to my bearish view is a rally in crypto currency prices, as a rebound in crypto prices can buoy HIVE's gross margins. Also, if a lot of crypto miners exit the space, mining difficulty would come down, making coins easier to mine and improving gross margins. Summary In summary, although HIVE delivered an eye-catching earnings report with $211 million in revenues and $79 million in earnings, those figures were backwards looking. At current crypto prices, HIVE would be mining at a negative gross margin. In addition, mining equipment appears to be becoming obsolete faster than expected by management. Finally, HIVE appears ill-prepared for the Ethereum transition to Proof-of-Stake. For these reasons, I would recommend investors stay away from HIVE.",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | MINING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4525258-hive-red-flags-in-quarterly-release?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/272783.jpeg

42374223,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvYIjj,1658522398,FTX to Offer Early Liquidity to Customers of Bankrupt Crypto Lender Voyager,"Crypto trading platform FTX is planning to offer early liquidity to customers of bankrupt crypto lender Voyager Digital.  The joint proposal comes two weeks after Voyager filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Alameda Ventures, a company controlled by FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, had previously given a loan of $200 million in cash/USDC and 15,000 bitcoins to Voyager.  FTX is working with West Realm Shires, the company that owns FTX.US, and Alameda Ventures to allow Voyager customers to create new accounts on FTX, the crypto exchange said in a press release on Friday.  Voyager customers who take the offer will have an opening cash balance funded by an early distribution on a portion of their bankruptcy claims, FTX said. They would be able to withdraw the cash immediately or use it to purchase digital assets on FTX. Voyager customers won't be required to participate in the plan.  “The goal of our joint proposal is to help establish a better way to resolve an insolvent crypto business – a way that allows customers to obtain early liquidity and reclaim a portion of their assets without forcing them to speculate on bankruptcy outcomes and take one-sided risks,” Bankman-Fried said in the press release.  FTX also said it won't purchase Voyager’s loans to hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, which also filed for bankruptcy this month, as part of the plan. And FTX expects that any recoveries from those loans would be available to fund supplemental distributions to Voyager customers, regardless of whether they opened an account with FTX.  FTX plans to complete the transaction in early August. The exchange didn't immediately respond to requests for more information.

42374248,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvYJ57,1658521387,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Finishes the Week in Positive Territory Again,"Hi, I'm Glenn Williams Jr., here to take you through the day's crypto market highlights and news.  Bitcoin (BTC) advanced slightly on Friday to trade just over $23,000, recently up 0.6% over the past 24 hours.  Friday’s performance resulted in a 14% increase for the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization over the previous seven trading days.  Bitcoin’s price has begun to decouple from traditional markets over the last 30 trading days. While its 90-day correlation with the S&P 500 sits at 0.96 (implying lockstep movement between the two), its 30-day correlation with the S&P 500 has declined to 0.78.  While 0.78 still implies a strong relationship between the two assets, the decline indicates that the two assets have begun to trade more independently of each other.  In traditional equity markets, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq were down 0.7% and 2.1%, respectively. West Texas Intermediate crude oil (WTI) is down 0.5%, while gold’s price has increased by 0.6%.  Ether (ETH) prices increased 1.59% on Friday.  Polkadot (DOT) and chainlink (LINK) led the gainers among alternative coins (altcoins) in the CoinDesk 20 index, rising 1.6% and 0.5%, respectively. Solana (SOL) and cosmos (ATOM) were the biggest losers, falling 4.29% and 4.22%, respectively.  Today’s edition of ""Market Wrap"" was produced by Sage D. Young.  Latest prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $22,666 −2.0%      ●Ether (ETH): $1,531 −2.4%      ●S&P 500 daily close: 3,954.39 −1.1%      ●Gold: $1,722 per troy ounce +0.6%      ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 2.78% −0.1       Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time.

A Look at This Week’s Performance Shows Higher Prices and Lower Correlations  By Glenn Williams Jr.  As we close the week, let’s look at how markets performed overall.  BTC and ETH outperformed traditional asset classes on the week, but still trail when looking at year-to-date performance. There’s also a noticeable shift in correlations when we narrow the time frame from 90 to 30 days.  For context, we use the correlation coefficient to examine the strength of the relationship between the price movements of different assets. A correlation close to 1 indicates a strong relationship between assets, while a correlation of zero indicates no relationship. Moreover, a correlation of -1 indicates a complete inverse relationship between the assets in question.  What we’ve noticed over the last 30 days of trading is that while BTC and ETH remain strongly correlated to each other (and will likely continue to be), the correlation between cryptocurrencies and traditional assets is beginning to return to levels witnessed earlier this year.  Funding rates continue to indicate BTC buying strength  An indicator that we broached earlier this week which bears reexamination is the current level of BTC funding rates. As a reminder, funding rates represent payments to traders that are long or short BTC. They can reflect trader sentiment within futures markets. When funding rates are positive, investors often view this as bullish in nature. Conversely, when funding rates are negative, investors view this as bearish. As it stands, BTC funding rates have been positive every day in July, except July 1, July 10 and July 15.  What are we keeping an eye out for next week?  Macroeconomic conditions were quiet Friday, but we will be eyeing a couple of key data points next week. Most notably will be the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) interest rate decision on Wednesday of next week. We fully expect rates to increase by 75 basis points, as reflected in current consensus estimates.  Note that we offer no exotic formula or tools of prognostication in voicing our expectations for FOMC decisions. We essentially monitor what they say, using tools like the FOMC “dot plot” (pictured below) as a guide.  For context, the FOMC dot plot is simply a record of each Federal Reserve official's projection for the Fed Funds rate. We expect that rates will increase to 2.5% next week and approach 3.5% by the end of 2022. To the extent that this remains unchanged, we anticipate that the price of BTC already reflects this data.

Based just outside Philadelphia and with offices worldwide, Susquehanna is a major liquidity provider for global traditional financial markets. It has a sizable presence in crypto, too: The firm makes markets on centralized crypto exchanges and has discussed doing so for decentralized finance (DeFi) derivatives platforms, a source at one prospective counterparty told CoinDesk.  Susquehanna didn't respond to requests for comment.  The planned expansion comes as a growing list of crypto players stake their offshore claim 150 miles east of Miami in an island nation where the crypto regulations are friendly and corporate taxes zilch. FTX Digital Markets, the derivatives powerhouse founded by billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried, sparked the relocation trend with its high-profile move to the Bahamas from Hong Kong.  Temptation island  Bahamian officials have campaigned for the industry’s business with open arms. The island is ready to be “a home for global leaders"" in the crypto space, Prime Minister Philip Davis said at the SALT conference in the Bahamas in May, where Bart Smith, Susquehanna’s crypto lead, also spoke.  While plenty of Caribbean islands have long courted international financiers, the Bahamas’ push for crypto regulation seen as favorable to the industry has made it a recent favorite – especially among the U.S. expatriate community, industry observers said.  “Major players in the crypto industry look for regulatory certainty and a stable framework to conduct their business operations,” Nicola Massella, head of legal for crypto consultancy Storm Partners, said. Creating some of the “most advanced and comprehensive” crypto legal frameworks in the world has made the Bahamas an industry hotbed.

The 24-hour trading volume of Curve Dao is $409 Million, indicating a hike of 38%. Past Performance of CRV As mentioned in our previous analysis, the Symmetrical triangle Breakout rally drives the Curve Dao(CRV) higher above the 100-day SMA. Additionally, the bullish reversal from the $0.55 mark responsible for the bullish breakout of the triangle pattern, accounts for a 144 % jump in the last month. The ongoing bull run challenges the psychological mark of $1.50 in an attempt to reach the $2 mark. Source- Tradingview CRV Technical Analysis The daily candle in the CRV price chart shows the higher price rejection due to the increased selling pressure above $1.50. Hence, traders hoping to find a bullish trend continuation must wait for a price action confirmation to avoid any traps. The RSI indicator shows a solid underlying bullishness as the RSI slope sustains a sideways trend in the nearly overbought zone. Furthermore, the 14-day SMA provides bullish support and avoids any major downfall. With an ongoing uptrend in the bullish histograms, the MACD indicator displays a positive trend in the fast and slow lines.

Recall Voyager Digital ( OTCPK:VYGVQ ) in the beginning of July filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy shortly after it froze customer withdrawals due to turbulent crypto market conditions. That's on top of its loan exposure to insolvent hedge fund Three Arrows Capital. Under the joint proposal, Voyager Digital's ( OTCPK:VYGVQ ) bankruptcy investors would be able to ""obtain early liquidity and reclaim a portion of their assets without forcing them to speculate on bankruptcy outcomes and take one-sided risks,"" said FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, who has become a rescuer of certain embattled crypto firms in the face of a market downturn. Furthermore, customers would have the option to transition to FTX with an opening cash balance funded by an early distribution on a chunk of their bankruptcy claims, the company said. FTX explained that participation among customers in the joint proposal is 100% voluntary. If customers choose to engage, they can withdraw their cash immediately, or use it to buy digital assets on FTX's trading platform. The company said it's hoping to close the transaction in early August, subject to Chapter 11 requirements and the need for court approval.

Key technical points: The MATIC prices jumped by 0.11% in the last 24 hours. The market value of polygon sustains above the 100-day SMA. The 24-hour trading volume of Polygon is $1.25 Billion, indicating a drop of 26%. Past Performance of MATIC Amid the recent recovery, the Polygon(MATIC) price has last breached the 100-day EMA and $0.75 resistance, providing a higher footing to carry forward this rally. However, in response to profit-booking from short-term trades, the price witnessed an 18.8% pullback, retesting the 100-day EMA. Source- Tradingview MATIC Technical Analysis Even though the MATIC price rebounded from the 100 EMA support with an inside candle, the buyers struggled to follow up this bull run, which displayed high-wick rejection and a 3% intraday loss. The RSI indicator shows a gradual increase in the underlying bullishness, with the RSI slope rising higher with the 14-day SMA.

Crypto Exchange Gemini Observes outflows Of 800k ETH As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the Ethereum exchange reserve has plunged down to lows not seen since 2018. The “all exchanges reserve” is an indicator that measures the total amount of Ethereum currently stored on wallets of all centralized exchanges. When the value of this metric goes down, it means the number of coins on exchanges are going down. Such a trend, when prolonged, can be a sign of accumulation from investors, and hence can be bullish for the price of the crypto. Related Reading | Bitcoin NUPL Shows Average Holder Back In Profit, But For How Long? On the other hand, an increase in the reserve implies users are depositing their coins right now. Since investors usually transfer to exchanges for selling purposes, this kind of trend can have bearish consequences for ETH. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Ethereum all exchanges reserve over the last couple of months: The value of the indicator seems to have plummeted down over the past 24 hours | Source: CryptoQuant As you can see in the above graph, the Ethereum exchange reserve has observed a crash in the last day as a large number of coins have been withdrawn. The chart also includes data for the “netflow,” which tells us about the amount of ETH entering or exiting exchange wallets (or more simply, it measures the changes in the exchange reserve). Its value is calculated by taking the difference between the inflows and the outflows.

In the past, transfers to and from the exchange have usually had a noticeable impact on the market. As such, such a large number of coins exiting from the exchange can mean Ethereum’s near term outlook might be bullish.

42421140,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXZWMH,1658515988,"SEC Will Need to Prove Tokens Are Securities in Coinbase Insider-Trading Case, Legal Expert Says","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will need to prove the tokens listed on the Coinbase crypto exchange are securities for it to pursue its current insider-trading case against a former Coinbase product manager and his associates, according to a former persecutor.  Ian McGinley, now a partner at the law firm of Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld, told CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” Friday that the SEC couldn't have filed the case unless the tokens in question are securities.  “They don’t have a wire fraud statute like the DOJ does,” McGinley said, referring to wire fraud charges issued by the U.S. Department of Justice on Thursday.  McGinley, who served more for more than a decade as an assistant U.S. attorney in the Southern District of New York, noted the Justice Department can sidestep the debate of whether the tokens are securities.  “The SEC doesn’t have that option,” McGinley said. “They will have to prove that it's a security.”  The SEC’s charges followed a complaint issued by the DOJ, alleging that Ishan Wahi, a former product manager at Coinbase, engaged in wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. The charges allege that Wahi shared confidential Coinbase information to tip off his brother Nikil Wahi and associate Sameer Ramani about which digital tokens were scheduled to be listed on the cryptocurrency trading platform. The two brothers and Ramani allegedly netted $1.5 million in profits from trading the tokens.  The SEC brought forth charges against the trio based on the same allegations. For the first time, however, the SEC used the complaint to identify the nine tokens the three allegedly traded as securities, without charging the issuers or exchanges issuing the digital assets.  McGinley notes that in this case, Coinbase is the victim “because it was their confidential information that was allegedly stolen.” Whether the crypto exchange will file to intervene as a witness remains to be seen. “They’re not a party to this action. They haven’t been charged in either case,” McGinley said.  Coinbase could be walking a fine line, McGinley said. On one hand, the defendant violated the exchange’s confidentiality policy and Coinbase doesn't “want employees [to be] able to do this.” On the other, the platform has responded to the case by saying that the tokens in question are not securities.  Generally, the SEC has brought enforcement actions against token issuers. In this case, the question of whether the issuers will have the opportunity to defend themselves remains unclear.  Earlier this week, Coinbase filed a petition to the SEC criticizing the current state of crypto regulation in the U.S., noting the “existing rules for securities just do not work for digital assets,” underscoring that without effective regulation, the U.S. would fall behind in digital asset innovation.  Whether Coinbase can be used as an example is still a gray area when it comes to regulation. “It really depends on the regulator,” McGinley said.  “This is the SEC saying, ‘We don’t need any new regulation here. A security token acts like a security, it walks like one, [and] we’re going to treat it like one for this insider-trading case,’” McGinley said.

As a consequence, the cryptocurrency has been moving sideways over the past two days while preserving some of its gains over the past week. The slowdown in bullish momentum coincides with an increase in asks (sell orders) liquidity for BTC’s price above its current levels and a spike in BTC’s supply inflows on crypto exchange platforms. On short timeframes, there are over $70 million in sell orders for Bitcoin from $23,000 to $24,000.

BTC’s price has been tapping into the immediate zone at $23,100, but data from Material Indicators records $18 million in selling orders at this level alone. As seen below, BTC’s price is seeing less liquidity below its current levels with big liquidity gaps at key levels. This could hint at high volatility to the downside if BTC continues to lose momentum and can’t break above $24,000 in the short term. In addition, Material Indicators records an increase in selling pressure from investors with sell orders above $100,000. These investors were accumulating BTC over the past week exercising a lot of influence on the price action. As the chart below shows, these investors (in purple below) have begun selling into the current price action. In this timeframes, it seems too early to conclude if this trend will continue and if it will have a negative impact on BTC’s price. Analyst Ali Martinez concurred with the data shown above.

42411436,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNlGj,1658512223,Why DeFi Might Be Safer Than Traditional Finance,"There are two questions of acute relevance I want to try to answer in the wake of the latest crypto market retreat. First, is decentralized finance more trustworthy and robust than conventional financial services? And second, are some DeFi systems more stable than others?  Those questions became newly weighty as a wave of loan defaults and insolvencies in recent weeks hit centralized “lending platforms” like Celsius Network and Voyager Digital. Those entities sometimes leveraged DeFi rhetoric and, in Celsius’ case, deployed customer funds to DeFi systems with extremely mixed results. Three Arrows Capital, arguably the Typhoid Mary of this year’s crypto contagion, had major exposure to the luna (LUNA) token and terraUSD (UST) algorithmic stablecoin, a fatally flawed system based on some DeFi principles. (For a thorough description of these relationships, see my recent account of the Great Crypto Unwind.)  At the same time, more reputable DeFi systems have held up better than centralized lenders in the downturn. While their volumes and yields have declined sharply, systems like the Uniswap exchange, Aave lending system and DAI stablecoin have continued to function smoothly. Most importantly, the systems haven’t been destabilized by huge losses from loan defaults or declining asset prices, which proved fatal for the centralized lenders.  So why did centralized and human-monitored players like Celsius and Voyager prove so fragile compared to largely automated systems? And what separates DeFi systems that did fail, particularly LUNA, from those that held up?  The answers are complex, but essentially boil down to specific financial and technical design decisions. Some of these, such as systemic transparency, overcollateralized lending and automated liquidation of borrowers, are inherent to DeFi. Other features, including “tokenomics” and governance, can vary dramatically between systems – and go a long way to explaining why not all DeFi is created equal.  What is DeFi?  First, a quick refresher. In theory, DeFi systems are to trading, lending and other financial services what bitcoin (BTC) is to currency. Because they’re run on distributed blockchains, these systems are meant to be uncensorable and transparent. They are built largely around “smart contracts,” on-chain functions that can be used by anyone with an internet connection and crypto in their wallet and which automatically execute without human supervision.  Smart contract-based DeFi services include digital asset trading and lending. Some stablecoins, such as MakerDAO’s DAI, are also based on DeFi technology. A core concept for trading and lending services is “yield farming” or “liquidity mining,” which rewards users for “staking” funds to liquidity pools. Standing pools of staked assets eliminate the need to directly match buyers with sellers or lenders with borrowers.  A further declared goal of DeFi is to dispense with centralized leadership and enable users to manage the systems, though that goal has been pursued inconsistently. For a deeper exploration, see CoinDesk’s full DeFi explainer.  Transparency  Arguably the defining characteristic of decentralized finance systems, the feature from which all others flow, is their almost complete transparency. Much as you can track bitcoin transactions by looking directly at blockchain records, DeFi systems allow near-complete visibility into loans and order books. This notably includes visibility into “liquidation points,” or asset prices at which the collateral for certain loans would be market-sold to cover losses. More on those in a moment.  This transparency is a sharp contrast to services like Celsius, which take depositor funds and deploy them in a wide variety of ways to generate yield. Depositors have almost no visibility into, much less oversight of, how those funds are deployed. Those deployments can include over-the-counter trades which are nearly impossible to spot on-chain, or intentional obfuscation of DeFi activities.  While that opacity can be a valid strategic choice for investment funds trying to outmaneuver competitors, it also means depositors in centralized systems are accepting a simply unknown amount of risk. The most dramatic illustration of this came with the revelation that a DeFi account known as 0Xb1 had been trading on behalf of Celsius, but did not disclose that connection – while apparently losing hundreds of millions of dollars.  “That is definitely one of the biggest issues when it comes to these [centralized lending] providers,” says Eric Chen, founder of the DeFi protocol Injective. “They say they’re going to deploy DeFi strategies for you, and they can undertake a lot more or a lot less risk than what the consumer prefers.”  Tight lending  An even more important bit of transparency in DeFi comes from strict policies on loan collateral. One reason Three Arrows Capital blew up is that it was taking out an array of huge loans from funds that were seemingly unaware of Three Arrows’ overall debt levels. In at least one case, a huge loan was issued with no collateral at all, apparently based purely on faith in Three Arrows.  But DeFi users face extremely conservative limits on borrowing, which help keep individual platforms stable. While Three Arrows (and traditional funds like Bill Hwang’s Archegos) can leverage their reputation to harvest loans all over town, DeFi platforms require collateral for loans, and that collateral must be effectively “locked” within the systems.  That prevents the pledging of the same collateral for multiple loans. Recycling collateral can be a form of fraud, but it’s hard to detect in traditional, centralized financial structures.  “Centralized providers, a lot of them are very credit-based,” says Chen. “And you can use the same collateral multiple times.”  The downside of DeFi collateralization standards, it should be noted, is relative inefficiency of capital. Because of that inefficiency, some question DeFi’s long-term value without something akin to a credit-rating system or other paths to undercollateralized lending. On the other hand, if DeFi’s capital inefficiency keeps leverage and risk from building up in the system, maybe that’s not such a bad thing.  Transparent, automated liquidations  Though specifics vary, most DeFi systems are set up to automatically liquidate loan collateral before the collateral falls below the value of the loan. That’s possible because collateral is locked into fully automated systems and forms a stark contrast to the frequently analog and interpersonal process by which centralized lenders issue margin calls for underwater borrowers.  The speed of liquidations is key to keeping protocols solvent. In a traditional lending context, including loans from centralized crypto exchanges to funds like Three Arrows, margin calling a large borrower can be an analog, slow, interpersonal process taking hours or days. That creates the opportunity for much larger imbalances to open up between falling collateral and outstanding loans.  And, of course, sometimes traditional loans don’t get repaid at all. Because its loans were off-chain, Three Arrows Capital was able to simply “ghost” creditors when it became clear it was insolvent. It appears Three Arrows may have on the order of $2 billion in uncovered debt outstanding, which has become an existential threat to counterparties including Voyager Digital.  By contrast, Celsius, despite also appearing insolvent, has repaid several large loans from DeFi lending protocols including AAVE, Compound and Maker. In the case of the Maker loan, a final $41 million repayment in the DAI stablecoin unlocked nearly half a billion dollars’ worth of collateral in wrapped bitcoin (wBTC).  In short, having collateral locked in a protocol seems to have a much greater disciplining effect than the legal agreements backing conventional loans. In fact, there remains some question of whether the protocols actually had legal primacy over other counterparties in the repayment stack, considering that Celsius entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection just days after those repayments.  It’s hard to think of a clearer affirmation of the old saw that possession (of your collateral) is nine-tenths of the law.  Hunting liquidation points  That’s one of the main reasons DeFi lending systems like Aave have weathered the crypto downturn better than centralized lenders. But transparent and automated liquidation also introduces extremely novel market dynamics, and perhaps its own set of risks.  Most notable is the visibility of borrowers’ “liquidation points.” Broadly, these are the price levels for particular assets at which a particular loan falls below required levels of collateralization. DeFi traders can identify specific price points that would trigger liquidations, and thus further major price drops.  These liquidation points are not publicly known in traditional asset markets, and their visibility in DeFi sets up fierce battles between bulls and bears when a major liquidation level is close – so-called “liquidation hunting.” While this can create volatility, it also arguably makes things fairer. Because while they’re not publicly known, various liquidation points in traditional markets are visible to entities like lenders and exchanges. That information asymmetry could easily be exploited by those centralized players.  That presents a bit of a philosophical quandary. Is it better for all players to know these liquidations points, creating a contentious but fair playing field? Or is it better that only a small number of people know, and the liquidation points don’t get widely hunted but trigger drops that are complete surprises to most in the market?  Automated liquidations do have at least two clear downsides.  First, while they protect individual platforms, they may increase broader risk for cascading liquidations of particular assets. A major liquidation of a big block of collateral risks driving down the collateral value for a tranche of other loans, which could in turn be liquidated, pushing the asset down further.  Second, and perhaps more pernicious, automated liquidation can function as a backdoor method to obfuscate asset sales. For instance, the creator of a project may use an automated liquidation to indirectly dump its token in a way that’s not transparent to users.  All DeFi is not created equal  While some DeFi projects have weathered the downturn, others most certainly have not. Above all, that includes the Luna Foundation Guard, which administered the luna ecosystem and algorithmic “stablecoin” terraUSD that collapsed in May. The system operated transparently and on-chain, fulfilling the most basic criteria for being considered “DeFi.” But its example also highlights that DeFi can certainly be designed in unsustainable or high-risk ways.  In particular, it is troubling to the idea of decentralization that the LUNA system was using external subsidies to pay yield to users who deposited funds – even if no one was taking loans at those rates. The Anchor protocol, Luna’s answer to a lending protocol like Aave, grew incredibly rapidly because it offered up to 20% interest on deposits. But that money came from a “yield fund” that periodically had to be refilled by Luna Foundation Guard administrators with funds from venture capitalists, rather than paying out yield generated from real loans.  Those subsidized yields helped attract deposits, substantially broadening the harm when the system collapsed. But exogenous subsidies aren’t inherently against the ethos of DeFi.  “At the beginning, you can devote some capital to building a liquidity pool,” says Maya Zehavi, an angel investor focused on DeFi. “I would call that active governance. [It’s] what investors are putting in as a value add.”  Indeed, an initial round of “yield farming” offers helped protocols, including Uniswap, to bootstrap liquidity pools that have since become self-sustaining. But those offers are usually time-limited, and robust DeFi systems adjust their yield based on loan demand. The problem with Luna and Anchor was that there was no plan to sunset the inflated yield rates, or allow them to adjust to match loan demand.  “What I see as natural DeFi is when you’ve developed a system that can generate its own fees,” says Zehavi, “And regenerate and be sustainable.”  Another variable between DeFi protocols is their approach to governance. A truly decentralized system would have no key figures or leaders – but in practice, many DeFi systems are controlled by a small group of developers.  ”There’s a key manager, there’s a multisig that has a lot of control over user funds,” says Eric Chen of Injective. “That almost feels custodial. Where user funds are lost, that’s usually when it’s something more centralized trying to disguise itself as being decentralized.”  Many of these effectively centralized systems justify their founders’ control as a step along the route to full decentralization. And indeed, there is no consensus about the best way to let users participate in system governance, such as decisions about yield structures.  “In the governance debate I’d take a nuanced view,” says Zehavi. “Some stuff should be governed off-chain … I think that direct democracy has proven again and again that it’s prone to manipulation.”  Good DeFi, bad DeFi  Experts seem to agree there’s no simple, straightforward way to separate robust DeFi structures from more fragile designs.  “There’s not really a gold standard or a yardstick for it,” says Chen. “You can tell easily by looking at code and contracts and how it’s structured, but in terms of a general user that’s pretty hard. It’s honestly just something you learn over time.”  For those who know what they’re looking for, Zehavi cites a long list of criteria for evaluating a platform. “I’m looking at how big the TVL [total value locked] is, what the [asset] concentration is, how big the pools are, where the yield is coming from, who the founders are. And I look for smart money.”  If you don’t feel confident evaluating a platform on those points, the good news is there are simpler rubrics. First, the protocols that have made it through the current crisis have probably earned some long-term trust, barring major system changes.  The second guideline is as simple as investing advice gets, and seemingly just as hard to follow: If something seems too good to be true, it probably is.  “A good general rule is, if [yield] returns are being advertised as risk-free, and they’re above the risk-free rate of the current market,” Chen warns, “It’s probably something a bit more on the concerning side.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,David Z.

42421479,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoUer,1658510439,Does Crypto Still Care About Elon Musk?,"In earnings disclosures Thursday, Tesla (TSLA) announced it had sold 75% of the bitcoin (BTC) held on its balance sheet. The company appears to have made a small profit on the BTC, which it first announced purchasing in early 2021.  Tesla’s initial purchase of $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin was huge news at the time, and helped fuel a more than 60% climb in the BTC price in the month following the announcement. But news that Tesla was liquidating its tokens has not had a corresponding negative effect on BTC price or, it seems, market sentiment. In fact, bitcoin has been up slightly in the day since Tesla disclosed the sales.  ​​This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  One might attribute that to Tesla’s framing of the BTC sale. During its recent quarterly earnings call, Musk emphasized the sale “should not be taken as some verdict on bitcoin,” and was instead mostly a move to free up U.S. dollars ahead of a possible economic downturn.  But as hard as it is for me to admit as a journalist, most people don’t read past the headline, and that headline is “Tesla sold its bitcoin.” What does it say about BTC, Musk or Tesla that markets have shrugged that off?  Most obviously, Tesla’s initial announcement came during a period of growing hype, when a large number of new cryptocurrency speculators were likely easily swayed by the moves of a big-name tech billionaire.  After the deflation of a huge crypto credit bubble and bitcoin’s price dropping nearly 60%, remaining holders are more likely to be strongly committed to bitcoin’s fundamentals and less concerned with the choices of one rich guy.  See also: Tesla's Musk Remains Open to Buying More Bitcoin  It's also true that, despite this year’s long drawdown, bitcoin and crypto in general are in a vastly different place than they were 18 months ago. Though two years of crypto hype produced the usual surfeit of scams and garbage, it has also dramatically advanced development, awareness and adoption, including El Salvador’s troubled but important bitcoin experiment. And while there are no guarantees, the market now seems to have found at least a temporary bottom, so Tesla’s sale announcement is fighting against a nascent bull narrative.  But another major factor is the change in Elon Musk and Tesla’s public image in the 18 months since the big bitcoin buy – changes that have been mostly for the worse.  Musk has had a reputation for impulsiveness for years, and a self-destructive streak was clear at least as far back as 2018 – the year he called a rescue diver a “pedo guy” and accepted a big fine from the Securities and Exchange Commission over tweets about taking Tesla private “at $420 per share.”  But back in 2018, Elon was still arguably transitioning from Silicon Valley hero to global figure. Tesla’s stock exploded in early 2020, and by January 2021 that rise had made him the wealthiest person in the world, at least on paper.  That has meant Musk’s misadventures over the past 18 months have been even more widely scrutinized than his series of tantrums in 2018. The list of public missteps is long, but standouts include allegedly sexually harassing a SpaceX employee and secretly fathering children with an employee (of an entirely different company).  On the crypto front, Musk spent years tweeting about dogecoin (DOGE), which may have been a troll from the beginning but wound up with a $285 million lawsuit against him when DOGE predictably crashed this year.  And the cherry on top, of course, has been his bizarrely half-cocked push to buy Twitter (TWTR), followed by attempts to back out under pathetically thin pretenses.  At the same time, those actually paying attention to Musk’s businesses might have noticed Tesla’s continued failure to deliver on the promise of “full self-driving,” and its delay of the much-hyped Cybertruck, even as legacy automakers muscle in on electric vehicles in a big way. Tesla stock has, like much of the market, given back large portions of its 2020 gains.  All in all, Musk may still retain a bit of a halo in the eyes of Tesla stockholders and “green tech” fans. But to many others, he has become nothing but a clownishly hype-obsessed avatar of capitalist excess, unaccountable to the society that made him rich, and indifferent to the harm he inflicts on the little people beneath his feet.  See also: Musk Learns the Hard Way: Crypto Doesn't Need a Savior | Opinion (2021)  For crypto experts specifically, Musk’s absurd and destructive shilling of dogecoin has made it clear that he either doesn’t understand the point of bitcoin, or at best, doesn’t care all that much.  Tesla’s bitcoin sale, for all the caveats about freeing up cash, confirms what some of us knew all along: Elon Musk isn’t someone you should look to for guidance on cryptocurrency.

The second crypto by market cap trades at $1,600 with a 35% profit in the past week. Related Reading | Crypto Market On The Mend: ApeCoin And Curve DAO Show Gains Trading firm QCP Capital shared a market update claiming the current bullish price action has been a “pleasant surprise for all”. This price action started on the back of the latest U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) print; a metric used to measure inflation. The CPI stands at a 40-year high which was expected to have a negative impact on the crypto market. The opposite occurred, the trading firm claims, due to market participants expecting lower inflation in the coming months. This potential decline in inflation could give some room for risk asset to continue their rally and persuade the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) from ruling out a 100-basis point (bps) interest rate hike. The financial institution will announce its decision on July 27. QCP Capital said: Currently, a 20% chance of 100bps is still being priced in but our view is that 75bps is the most the Fed will do. So expect another boost as 100 bps gets completely priced out. Ethereum is leading the relief because there is more clarity around the upcoming “Merge”, an event set to combine this network’s execution layer with its consensus layer. Thus, consolidating Ethereum’s migration to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus protocol. “The Merge” has been tentatively scheduled for September which has contributed to the shift in the general sentiment across the crypto market and supported this rally. The bullish price action, QCP Capital said, has been “keenly felt in the options market”. The sector saw a “rush” to purchase buy contracts (calls) for the September expiry. In other words, options traders are bullish on the potential impact that “The Merge” will have on Ethereum. Can Ethereum Extend Current Rally? Conversely, the options markets hint at potential exhaustion for Ethereum in the short term. QCP Capital records an increase in calls selling for ETH’s price and believes insolvencies announcements from other companies could operate as tailwinds for the second crypto by market cap. Part of the contagion triggered by the default of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC), which failed to honor billions in debts from their counterparties, many companies have been negatively impacted. This includes Celsius, BlockFi, Voyager, and Genesis. These companies have had to halt their operations at some levels with new companies announcing that they have been affected by 3AC coming out almost every week. Yesterday, crypto exchange Zipmex suspended withdrawals, and there have been growing rumors about other companies taking similar measures.

The newly passed bill will come into effect in 60 days. The state’s Fair Political Practices Commission approved the new requirement, the LA Times reported on July 21. Additionally, as per the new law norms, the candidates can only accept the crypto donation when they can immediately convert the digital assets into fiat. New Law Focuses on the KYC The new law specifies that candidates must work with authorized and registered cryptocurrency processors to complete the transaction. And for the processor part, they must perform the Know Your Customer (KYC) practices like submitting the contributor’s name, address, occupation, employer, and other relevant details. Guidelines On Crypto Donation By FEC According to some of the communication, committees are eligible to receive Bitcoin as long as they sell the asset. However, the FEC clarified that possessing Bitcoin does not absolve political organizations of their duty to return a donation that comes from an illegal source or exceeds the contributor’s contribution cap. The FEC states that since 2014, donations made using cryptocurrencies have been permitted in federal elections. Some state governments, however, are opposed to the idea and have passed legislation outlawing contributions. The panel also stated that political committees should value donations given in digital currency according to their market value at the time of the gift. Despite the regulatory uncertainties, donations for cryptocurrency-related causes other than politics have increased recently.

42421476,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoUhx,1658502453,To Use or Hold? Solving the Classic Crypto Conundrum With a Dual Token Model,"Are two tokens better than one? It’s a question that blockchain developers are increasingly wrestling with, even if the major networks aren’t likely to change their model anytime soon.  Although the traditional single-token system favored by Bitcoin and Ethereum undoubtedly has its merits – deep liquidity, simplicity – only a two-token model can solve blockchain's perennial economic conflict that stymies network growth by disincentivizing actual network use.  Let me explain.  Da Hongfei is the founder of the Neo blockchain and a developer of the international ISO-TC307 blockchain standard.  A problematic paradox  Ultimately, all blockchains share a common goal: to reliably record transactions, store economic value and engender network growth. Sure, they set about achieving these goals in various ways, and some have stronger privacy guarantees than others. But fundamentally, they pull in the same direction.  At present, the vast majority of blockchain ecosystems depend on a single token,one that reflects the value of the project and is simultaneously used as a store of value (similar to a stock), a medium of exchange (money), a mining reward and a way to pay transaction fees. Therein lies the problem.  Holders of a crypto asset – the very lifeblood of any token-based economy – support the project and want it to succeed. They amass tokens because they like the tech, trust the developers and have faith that a project (and its native asset) will succeed.  See also: Bitcoin's Biggest Question Isn't Ease of Use, It's 'Why Use it?' | Opinion (2015)  However, if they spend their tokens – on gas fees for instance – they reduce their stake in the whole enterprise. Conversely, if they refuse to part with their tokens, they neglect actually using a network.  This paradox is easy to understand but difficult to reconcile. Unlike currencies, crypto assets have the potential to markedly appreciate over time, making them attractive to long-term savers. This is a good thing from the perspective of blockchains, whose developers strive to create loyal communities that spread the good word.  The choice between actively using a protocol (and reducing their stake through paying gas fees) or holding onto tokens to hopefully profit at a later date is an economic and emotional conflict.  There is also a question of influence. In some ecosystems, spending your tokens can reduce the amount of authority and leverage you have in certain governance models. This makes users even more reluctant to “spend” their hard-won tokens on utility use-cases.  But there's an alternative.  Making the economics work  You shouldn’t have to eat into your tokens just to transact value. It’s like buying a cup of coffee with your Starbucks (SBUX) shares, or snapping up the latest iPhone with your precious Apple (AAPL) stock. And it’s particularly painful when transaction fees skyrocket due to network congestion.  Back in February, fees for transacting on Ethereum breached previous records after rising above $20 for the first time. If you’re an Ethereum diehard, parting with $20 of ETH every time you want to make a transaction is like discarding a Lotto ticket before the draw occurs. After all, that $20 might be worth $200 in five years.  A dual-token economy fixes this. In such a scenario, one token fulfills governance duties, while another is reserved solely to pay gas. In such a system, holders of the primary token can be considered the “owners” of the network, as they are entitled to influence the project’s direction via voting. The gas token, meanwhile, is completely decoupled from the main asset. Thus the ""stake reduction through use"" problem is solved.  Dual-token systems are still in the minority, and perhaps that’s because blockchain OGs are reluctant to introduce sweeping changes to their model. We have seen several blockchains fork in the past, and the ensuing fallout is invariably ugly. Modifying a protocol’s basic rules by introducing a separate gas token isn’t a decision to take lightly.  Second- and third-generation blockchains, however, appreciate the benefits of issuing separate tokens for governance/payments and incentives/gas. And it’s not just blockchains either: Many GameFi projects, stablecoin protocols and lending/funding platforms have all bought into a two-token system, meaning their users no longer need to sacrifice liquidity or compete for scarce on-chain resources.  Projects such as Neo (my project), VeChain, Ontology, Axie Infinity and Frax all experiment with differing two-token models and, in my view, future-proofing their businesses.  That said, as with any experimental technology, protocol designs can go awry. This was demonstrated by the catastrophic implosion of the Terra blockchain, which used a native asset, LUNA, to help secure a series stablecoins, most notably the dollar-denominated UST token.  See also: 'Built to Fail'? Why TerraUSD's Growth Is Giving Finance Experts Nightmares | Opinion  Researchers noted long before its collapse that the network's design created incentives to short the stablecoin, an issue that isn't and need not be repeated in other two-token systems.  Two tokens to rule them all  The economics of a two-token system can be, as several projects have already demonstrated, sound. There are several common characteristics to a two-token model.  Firstly, the primary token typically has a limited total supply, and is used for governance, share-of-voice or dividend distribution. It is often allocated via a public sale or grants.  In contrast, the secondary token – or utility token – has an unlimited or resilient supply. It is used for on-chain payments and gas fees, and is rewarded to participants of its ecosystem or primary token holders.  The price of a utility token rises when the growth rate of economic activity exceeds its inflation supply rate. As the yield of utility tokens rises, the demand and price for the primary token rises until the yield reaches a new equilibrium level.  In the end, utility tokens form a positive feedback to governance tokens through economic activity.  Following this model, the economic/emotional conflict that forces users to choose between actively using the protocol and investing long-term is solved. When a utility token is used for ongoing incentives and system growth, primary token holders are incentivized to take part in on-chain activities and secure the network.  With cutting-edge technology like blockchain, novel ideas need to be embraced. A two-token model is no longer an outré fantasy but a workable solution to a maddening problem. Where blockchain economies are concerned, two really can be better than one.",NEUTRAL,ETH,AXS | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | NEO,Da Hongfei,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/07/22/to-use-or-hold-solving-the-classic-crypto-conundrum-with-a-dual-token-model,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8d45f4ab363039850bb1f32d69b33974e120130f-1991x1493.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin is the “Amazon of Crypto” Appearing on Layah Heilpern’s crypto podcast, Down had all praises for Bitcoin (BTC), calling it “the Amazon of crypto.” According to him, the digital asset will become much more stable after the current bear market where most investors will adopt it as a modern alternative to gold. His narrative comes from the fact that it is easier to deal with digital assets than with precious metals. For instance, people can buy small portions of it and need not worry about keeping it in vaults. All they need to do is just not lose their private keys. Earlier this year, BlackRock’s current Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink stated that his company is actively “studying digital currencies, stablecoins, and the underlying technologies.” Fink revealed that the huge investors’ appetite for crypto services from customers was the reason behind the decision. However, he was not always supportive of the flagship cryptocurrency in its early days. Back in 2017, he called it an “index of money laundering.” Similarly, in 2020, he argued that the advancement of cryptocurrency could undermine the dominance of the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency.

Along with regulatory approval, the firm is now allowed to offer a variety of goods and services to customers in Cyprus by national laws. The new regulatory milestone is consistent with Crypto.com’s aggressive expansion of its operations and receipt of approvals to conduct business in nations like Italy, Greece, and Singapore, which has led to the company’s escalating global footprint. The approval to conduct business in Cyprus does not just apply to Crypto.com. FTX, a significant rival exchange, has also been growing in Europe since getting CySEC permission in March 2022. In light of the lousy market, other exchanges like Coinbase have also shown an increased interest in developing in Europe. Cyprus Government Not Cleared About Regulating Crypto Even though international exchanges are expanding their presence in the Cypriot market, the Cyprus government has not been clear about how cryptocurrencies will be regulated in recent years. In 2021, many regional financial institutions reportedly blocked Bitcoin (BTC)-related transactions, including the Bank of Cyprus. In September, CySEC revealed plans to strengthen regulation of cryptocurrencies by incorporating Cypriot legislation with EU anti-money laundering rules.

The founders' unknown whereabouts came as a court in the British Virgin Islands towards the end of June ordered Three Arrows to liquidate, but their cooperation has been minimal. Still, “that does not mean that we haven’t been communicating with all relevant authorities,” Zhu said, as quoted by Bloomberg. “We have been communicating with them from day one,” they added. The formerly prominent hedge fund fell apart in mid-June after its leveraged crypto bets turned sour due tanking crypto prices at the time, and therefore faced a slew of margin calls. 3AC's downfall was exacerbated by its access to easy-flowing credit, Bloomberg reported, citing Zhu during the interview. 3AC's heavy losses were also tied to the abrupt collapse of algorithmic stablecoin TerraUST ( UST-USD ) and its sister token Luna ( LUNA-USD ), Bloomberg noted. “What we failed to realize was that Luna was capable of falling to effective zero in a matter of days and that this would catalyze a credit squeeze across the industry that would put significant pressure on all of our illiquid positions,” Zhu said. Zhu, meanwhile, denied claims that he and Davies withdrew funds from 3AC prior to its meltdown. “People may call us stupid. They may call us stupid or delusional. And, I’ll accept that. Maybe,” Zhu said, as quoted by Bloomberg. “But they’re gonna, you know, say that I absconded funds during the last period, where I actually put more of my personal money back in. That’s not true.” 3AC's collapse ultimately resulted in financial contagion effects spreading throughout the crypto ecosystem, namely to those that had loan exposure to the Singapore-based hedge fund, including crypto firms Genesis , Voyager Digital , and Blockchain.com . The founders were apparently tracked down in the UAE, which is known to be an emerging crypto hub as it reportedly planned to issue national crypto licensing in mid-February in a move that would allow crypto firms to set up shop in the Middle Eastern country.

42374243,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvYJ1L,1658499781,"Nexo, Crypto Lender on Prowl for Ailing Rivals, Faces Declining Deposits","Crypto lender Nexo has positioned itself in recent months as a potential acquirer of ailing crypto firms.  But data posted on the website of an accounting firm contracted by Nexo to provide regular attestations on customer balances shows that the lender may have suffered from withdrawals similar to those that led to troubles at rivals.  The firm's customer liabilities – the value of digital assets users deposited on the platform – declined to $3.9 billion as of Thursday, down from $6.9 billion on May 12, based on the real-time attestations provided by Armanino LLP. CoinDesk obtained data on the prior time period by accessing the Wayback Machine, a tool that records earlier versions of websites for posterity. Nexo is a private company, so its financial statements aren't publicly available.  The drop in the customer liabilities works out to about a 44% decrease. During that time, bitcoin's (BTC) price fell by about 20%, and the price of ether (ETH), the second-biggest cryptocurrency, was down 22%. So market factors may account for some of the drop.  Customer liabilities expressed in bitcoin terms, which helps filter out the fluctuation in crypto prices, fell to 169,672 BTC from 261,111 BTC – a 35% drop over the same period.  “It's very natural behavior, given the state of the market,"" said Vetle Lunde, an analyst at the crypto research firm Arcane Research who conducted and published his own assessment of the Nexo data earlier in the week. ""Nexo users are cautious given the shaky market conditions and the bankruptcies affiliated with other big retail-oriented crypto lending platforms.”  A Nexo spokesperson told CoinDesk that the outflows from the platform “are proportional to the volatility in the space” and are considered “relatively normal for such a bumpy time” in the crypto market.  “They are nothing Nexo hasn't seen before during previous periods of volatility like the 2020 COVID panic,” the spokesperson added.  This year's crash in crypto prices has rattled nerves of retail depositors while also saddling big industry players with losses on assets they had lent out in search of yields. Celsius Network, a crypto lender, and Voyager, a crypto trading platform, each froze withdrawals and later declared bankruptcy. Another distressed lender, BlockFi, received a credit lifeline from crypto exchange FTX, which later gained an option to acquire the firm at a steep discount.  Nexo has so far avoided such drastic moves and appears to have sidestepped some of the worst debacles. The platform managed to avoid headlines in the multibillion-dollar crash of the Terra blockchain and also steered clear of the implosion of the crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital.  ""As you may have read from Three Arrows Capital's reveal, Nexo's name was not among those exposed,"" the Nexo spokesperson said.  Nexo says it lends funds on a strictly overcollateralized basis, a practice that provides protection in case a borrower defaults on the loan.  The Nexo spokesperson emphasized to CoinDesk that ""at any moment Nexo's assets under management exceed its obligations, meaning we are stable and able to provide clients with their funds at any time.""  Nexo’s acquisition plans  Nexo has been vocal about looking to capitalize on the weakness of competitors, characterizing itself as a consolidator in the crypto lending space. The firm hired banking giant Citigroup to advise it on deals to acquire other crypto lenders.  When Nexo announced an offer last month to buy assets from Celsius, the offer was formalized in a letter sent from an entity called Nexo AG in Zug, Switzerland. At the time, executives told CoinDesk that Nexo’s operations were based out of Sofia, Bulgaria. According to the spokeswoman, the company is based in London.  Earlier this month, Nexo signed a term sheet to acquire Vauld, an ailing crypto lending platform backed by Peter Thiel and Coinbase Ventures that halted withdrawals, cut jobs and looks to restructure. Earlier this month, Vauld filed for protection from creditors in Singapore.  ""The Nexo and Vauld teams are in constant contact surrounding the former's potential acquisition of Vauld,"" the spokesperson said. ""Our team was aware of the filing and that it would in no way affect our ability to conduct our due diligence, and if everything checks out, proceed with an acquisition.  “Nexo has an expansive war chest for such deals and does not use clients' funds for such activity in any way.”  Fewer deposits on Nexo “may have second-order effects, in this instance impacting Nexo's revenue"" from lending, Arcane's Lunde said.  The platform’s utility token, nexo (NEXO), is down 80% this year, currently trading at 70 cents.

The Russian news agency Tass first reported on the news on Thursday.  According to Belot, however, the move will allow U.S. authoritiesto keep Vinnik in prison longer and later extradite him to Greece, where he was first arrested in 2017, and, ultimately, to the U.S. Vinnik was indicted there in 2020 by a California court on allegations of “computer intrusions and hacking incidents, ransomware scams, identity theft schemes, corrupt public officials and narcotics distribution rings.”  Belot declined to explain the legal mechanism being used by U.S. authoritieswhen asked by CoinDesk, only responding that ""by withdrawing their request, the U.S. reactivate the Greece request.""  Vinnik, a Russian national, is known as an operator of BTC-e, one of the earliest bitcoin exchanges, which was linked to the hack of Mt.Gox, the first bitcoin exchange, which never recovered after a theft of 744,408 BTC and had to shut down in 2014.  Vinnik has always denied that he ran BTC-e, claiming he only worked at the exchange.  BTC-e, in turn, was shut down by U.S. authorities in 2017, its servers confiscated and Vinnik arrested in Greece where he was on a beach with his family. Since then, three countries have been competing to extradite Vinnik – the U.S., France and Russia – with all three presenting a different set of allegations.  France prevailed in 2020, and Vinnik was sentenced to five years in prison there by a French court, with the sentence being upheld last summer. However, U.S. authorities have never given up on putting him in a jail in America, according to his lawyers.  BTC-e's offspring, named WEX, was launched just a few months after the BTC-e website went offline. WEX had access to BTC-e's user base and offered to gradually refund what BTC-e users lost after it was shut down.  However, WEX also stopped functioning in the summer of 2019.

People are becoming more optimistic as a result of these improvements. ApeCoin (APE) is ranked number thirty-three in the top 100 coins. It is an ERC-20 token generated for governance and utility. The decentralized autonomous organization ApeCoin DAO developed and debuted the coin and is based on the Ethereum blockchain network. Related Reading | TA: Ethereum Eyes Fresh Surge, Why ETH Could Surpass $1,700 APE has climbed dramatically from its June low of $3.1189. According to data from CoinGecko, the price of ApeCoin today is $6.7739, up 17% from the previous day and 43% from the last week. Its current market cap is $2.08 billion, with a significant rise of 16% during the last 24 hours. APE is linked to the well-known Bored Ape Yacht Club. Yuga Labs developed the Bored Ape Yacht Club, a 10,000-strong non-fungible tokens (NFTs) with an ape theme with various aspects and distinctive qualities, such as digital art, image, music, and video files that have been tokenized and protected using blockchain technology. Its price increased after Yuga Labs gave a select group of gamers a sneak peek into its Otherside metaverse. Therefore, this might be one of the key causes that contributed to the APE price increase. As per the announcement, the 4,300 players, referred to as “Voyagers,” were welcomed to the immersive, ape avatar-navigated internet platform on Saturday for a first-look tech presentation and tour. Curve DAO (CRV) Is Steadily Struggling To Recoup Its Value Due to the market meltdown this year, other coins are struggling to recover, and CRV is also on the path to recovery with them. Curve DAO is a native token for Curve Finance, one of the world’s largest decentralized finance (DeFi) systems. Since its introduction, Curve DAO has attempted to sustain some of the momenta after falling from its highs. However, from the start of this year, the CRV token has experienced sharp declines. It started the year at $6.2061 and dropped to $2.3958 in the first month. After falling from the $2 level, it reaches a new low in the second month. In March and April, the token’s price slowly kept increasing, fluctuating between $2.78 and $1.95. But, things started to change in June when the token experienced a continuous slide and hit a low of $0.54047.

I’m Lyllah Ledesma, here to take you through the latest in crypto markets, news and insights.  In today’s newsletter:  Price Point: Bitcoin was pushing back toward $24,000 as U.S. Treasury bond yields tumble. Ether extended its extraordinary rally (up 52% this month alone) after comments Thursday on the Merge by co-founder Vitalik Buterin.  Market Moves: Binance clarified that coins deposited in its recently launched staking program for proof-of-work (PoW) token dogecoin (DOGE) and litecoin (LTC) would remain with the exchange and will not be lent out for generating additional yield. Omkar Godbole reports.  Price Point  Bitcoin (BTC) was trading up 3% on the day after a positive week for the cryptocurrency. BTC reached highs of $24,250 on Wednesday, its highest since mid-June.  Ether (ETH) was up 9% on the day, extending this month's spectacular rally, with a 52% price gain in July alone. On Thursday, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin spoke about the network's upcoming Merge at the Ethereum Community Conference in Paris.He said that in terms of Ethereum’s overall network development, the protocol will be “55% complete once we finish the Merge.” Thus, there is much more work for developers ahead.  (By the way, if you didn't catch my dispatch this week from the EthCC conference in Paris, that's here.)  NEAR protocol was also trading in the green on Friday, up 11%. Uniwap's UNI was up 8%.  In traditional markets, stocks were on track for their best week in a month. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note declined by seven basis points (0.07 percentage point) to 2.81%. The yield is down from nearly 3.5% a little over a month ago, a trend that some economists suggest could be a signal that a recession is coming.  Meanwhile, Three Arrows Capital (3AC) has finally broken its silence in an interview with Bloomberg. 3AC founders Su Zhu and Kyle Davies discuss how one of the most successful crypto funds went from being a prominent trading desk to owing creditors $2.8 billion.  The duo described the collapse as ""regrettable,"" but denied claims that they pulled money from the fund before its collapse, according to the report.  CoinDesk's Nikhilesh De reported the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Department of Justice (DOJ) brought insider trading charges against three people Thursday, but assertions cryptocurrencies are securities may hold greater implications.  The SEC formally declared nine digital tokens as “securities“ in its ongoing practice of defining its crypto oversight through enforcement actions.  And finally, Citigroup said in a report Wednesday that with numerous brokers and market makers making counterparty exposure disclosures, Celsius filing Chapter 11 and staked ether (stETH) returning towards parity, it is likely crypto contagion fears have peaked in the interim.  (It's important to note: Just this week, the Singapore-based cryptocurrency exchange Zipmex apparently became a fresh victim of the contagion, when it halted deposit withdrawals. Zipmex said Thursday in a Facebook post that it was dealing with some $53 million of combined exposure to the troubled crypto lenders Babel Finance and Celsius.)  Staked ether’s discount to ether has narrowed, which suggests some liquidity stress may have passed, the report said. The “acute deleveraging phase” has now ended given many of the large brokers and market makers in the sector have disclosed their exposures, according to the bank.

In an e-mail to CoinDesk, the exchange's spokesperson said on Friday, ""there is no on-chain staking of LTC and DOGE for network validation since these are non-proof-of-stake tokens. The user funds remain with Binance and we have very strict risk management controls to ensure their security.""  The explanation comes after several prominent social media influencers and investors disapproved of the program after it went live on Tuesday, questioning how it is possible to stake coins like DOGE and LTC, as their parent blockchains use a proof-of-work consensus mechanism.  ""Oh boy. @Binance announced another 'holding' program. This one is referred to as 'Locked Staking,' and it allows you to 'stake' LTC and Dogecoin. How is that even possible when #LTC and #Dogecoin are PoW cryptos,"" a popular dogecoin-focused Twitter handle Mishaboar tweeted on Tuesday.

Crypto.com Supporting Native Currencies The native token of Marlin (POND) is an open protocol providing network infrastructure for decentralized internet and finance. Marlin uses rewards to entice additional platforms and applications to join the network. The POND coin is used for governance and staking. As of this writing, POND is selling for $0.013. The 416th-ranked cryptocurrency asset by market size has increased by 14% over the last day and almost 20% in the previous seven days. The native currency of MetisDAO (METIS), a layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum (ETH), has also gained support on Crypto.com. With the security of the top smart contract platform, ETH, the Metis protocol seeks to provide reduced costs and quicker transaction times. METIS can be used for internal payments and staking, but it also fulfills a crucial role in the Metis Virtual Machine (MVM) for establishing a decentralized autonomous firm (DAC). The coin was listed on Coinbase in late June. At the time of writing, the price of METIS is $33.84. Cryptocurrency assets with the 200th-highest market cap increased by more than 10% over the last day and more than 50% over the past week. Users of the Crypto.com App may now purchase POND at actual cost using USD, EUR, GBP, and 20+ other fiat currencies and utilize the Crypto.com Visa Card to make purchases at more than 80 million merchants locations across the world.

On a lighter note, the panel foresees that SOL may shoot to a glorious $166 by 2025. In fact, in 2030 the price is said to spike to a whopping $512 by 2030. Most of the panel of experts say that now is the time to buy SOL. Well, it’s pretty much a divided zone as around 29% believe that it’s time to sell the token while 40% think that it’s time to HODL.

According to the Magic Eden listing, the Swedish term means “the road-like reflection of the moon on water.” Hoffman wrote that he was inspired by “words that exist in another language where no single-word equivalent in your own language exists.” Hoffman also said that the current bearish market is very lucrative for developers and entrepreneurs who want to work in this space and are focused “on long-term value creation.” He plans to split the funds generated by each piece between charitable causes as well as his team of collaborators. Any NFT that is not purchased during the auctions will be burned or permanently destroyed. “If a piece is claimed, I’ll give all royalties and proceeds to (1) a nonprofit or cause related to the collection, and (2) the creative team. If a piece receives zero bids, it gets “burned” and disappears – as an NFT in our collection – forever,” he said.

Asia Dow ended the day 0.37% higher, with gains of over 0.4% in Japan’s Nikkei 225 and Singapore. In Europe, Germany’s DAX rose 0.28%, and the Stoxx 600 jumped 0.4%. U.S. stock futures, however, slipped as investors await the next batch of second-quarter earnings reports. S&P 500 traded 0.26% lower, and the Nasdaq 100 fell 0.42% ahead of the opening bell in New York.  Global stocks remain on course for their best week in over a month, with speculation that the worst of the sell-off has passed, according to Bloomberg. Meanwhile, crypto market observers said bitcoin (BTC) gains came as traders assessed the upcoming round of U.S. rate hikes. Odds show a 77% chance of a 75-basis point hike.  “Since the high CPI (consumer price index) print, the market has been decisively pricing out the probability of a 100bps hike in the July FOMC [meeting of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee],” QCP Capital traders said in a Telegram broadcast on Friday. “Currently, a 20% chance of 100bps is still being priced in, but our view is that 75bps is the most the Fed will do.  “Expect another boost as 100 bps gets completely priced out,” the QCP traders said. However, QCP said it was “not sure” if the upside momentum continues in a big way as “the market is starting to show some signs of exhaustion.”  Ether rose nearly 10% in the past 24 hours, continuing a run from earlier this week. The asset has propped up ahead of the “Merge,” an upgrade on the Ethereum network in September, which has led to some calling the price rise the “Merge trade.”  In the past 24 hours, bitcoin rose 4.5%, showing signs of strength as it consolidated over the $23,500 level. BNB, XRP, Solana’s SOL and Cardano’s ADA all rose over 5%, while dogecoin underperformed bitcoin with a 3.4% rise.  Mike Tedeschi, market adviser at TradeZing, said the firm considers $28,000 as a “major” area of resistance for bitcoin with $18,000 as a support level.  “There are three major price zones that we are watching. The major upside resistance zone is at $28,000. This area was the low from 2021 and acted as support in the summer of 2021,” Tedeschi said. “However, if bitcoin falls below the $18,000 zone, the major level of support is around $12,000, which is where the 2020 breakout zone is.”  Meanwhile, FRNT Financial founder and principal Stéphane Ouellette said inflation pressures continue to affect sentiment around bitcoin.  “Similar to other risk assets, the pressures increased inflation is putting on the current rate environment is having a major impact on speculative assets such as bitcoin,” Ouellette said. “Furthermore, selling bitcoin is a very easy way for speculators to decrease risk in their portfolio.”  Ouellette added cryptocurrencies were the first assets to face selling pressure.  “Bitcoin and other liquid cryptos tend to see heavy selling pressure as it is one of the only highly speculative assets in a portfolio that investors can easily sell,” he said.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/07/22/ether-breaks-16k-on-merge-hype-crypto-funds-price-in-july-rate-hike,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a096195e98cf8c6d521aa8b4c3f2016c63a96a8d-3764x2823.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Thanks to the capital inflow, the company is now worth $400 million. In a blog post on Thursday, the company listed investors in this round naming Dragonfly Capital Partners, Electric Capital, LedgerPrime, Balaji Srinivasan, Jump Crypto, GSR, Kronos Research, Altonomy, Wintermute Trading, Coinbase Ventures, Kraken Ventures, Evernew Capital, Space Whale Capital, Fabric Ventures, Meltem Demirors, Anthony Sassano and Jason Choi. Hashflow informed on its website that the current raised fund would be used “to continue to build and scale regardless of market conditions.” Per the roadmap, the firm aims to introduce the trading platform on Solana during this year’s third quarter to facilitate native and cross-chain swaps. HashFlow Planning to Offer Structured Products HashFlow intends to create a decentralized request-for-quote (RFQ) platform “to effortlessly trade structured products,” such as options and exchange-traded funds, by the fourth quarter of this year in permitted jurisdictions. Founded in 2021, HashFlow provides a decentralized exchange (DEX) that employs an RFQ approach. The firm’s website states that this method eliminates the need for automated market makers, who are more “capital inefficient, consistently prone to dangers and cannot price non-spot assets,” and instead rely on professional market makers to maintain liquidity pools.

42374228,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvYIol,1658492846,Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Drops as Miners Feel the Texas Heat,"The difficulty of mining a bitcoin block dropped by 5% on Thursday as miners turned off their machines to lower power demands on energy grids dealing with a U.S. heat wave, particularly in Texas.  The bitcoin mining difficulty adjusts automatically every two weeks to keep the time needed to mine a new block roughly at 10 minutes. As more computing power gets plugged into the network, the difficulty adjusts higher, and as computing power gets pulled from the network – as has been happening recently, the difficulty adjusts lower.  Read more: Everything You Need to Know About Bitcoin Mining Difficulty  The difficulty on Thursday fell 5% to roughly the same level it was back in March, data from mining pool BTC.com shows.  ""The difficulty was reduced as American miners turned off their machines for significant periods over the past two weeks as electricity prices soared due to a heatwave,"" Jason Mellerud, a senior researcher at Arcane Research, said.  It's the third consecutive decrease in mining difficulty and the first time this has happened since four straight declines one year ago when Chinese miners packed up their rigs because of the country's ban on bitcoin mining.  ""The initial drop in the hashrate at the middle of June was likely caused by the plummeting BTC price,"" Mellerud continued. ""But the second drop at the beginning of July was likely caused by miners powering down in response to high electricity prices.""  Watch: How Crypto Mining is Impacting the Power Grid in Texas  When demand increases over a certain threshold, some miners can bring in more revenue by selling their contracted power to the grid as opposed to using it to mine bitcoin.

XMR has been gaining momentum since June 13 as it has been enjoying highest highs over the past few months. The token has been on an uptrend for the fourth day in a row and today it’s at fever-pitch with an intraday high beaming at $153.09 3hich is considerably the highest gain it has had since June 13. With this big move, XMR/USD has set its targets on a new resistance level at $155, which will be considered as the price ceiling for many traders. This new price ceiling will come in tandem with another resistance level. Monero Going For A Bull Run At $175 Two things can happen: The bears might look at the market scenario as being overbought and will then reenter or can even push other bulls to vacate their recent positions. On the other hand, if a breakout happens, then Monero could push for a bull run toward a higher ceiling eyed at $175. XMR was able to breach its support zone and is now trying to retest the trendline. XMR is currently going for an ascending triangle pattern. Suggested Reading | Binance Coin Trading Volume Up 35% As BNB Spikes To $274 The XMR/BTC pair soared by 0.67% in market cap and is currently trading at 0.006390; evident in the past 24 hours. XMR is showing a downtrend after it has successfully breached the long-term resistance zone and has turned the supply zone now at $135. It has been retesting that resistance level by forming higher highs and higher lows. It has now tried doing the contrast and forming lower lows and lower highs for a shorter time frame. XMR total market cap at $2.76 billion on the daily chart | Source: TradingView.com The Monero coin has been showing a bearish movement as it was able to cross the long-term demand zone. The bearish trend has caused the breakdown set at $200 giving away a sell-off signal. Now, the coin is trading under the supertrend line which works as a resistance. So, if XMR can break out of its triangle pattern, it will show a bullish streak in price. If it cannot sustain the supertrend line of $200 then the price can further drop to $100. Suggested Reading | Cardano (ADA), After 35% Spike, Locks On Next Target: $0.55 XMR Forms Falling Wedge Pattern If the $135 supply zone is breached, then this can push the price up to $175. XMR is currently forming the falling wedge pattern as it shoots for lower lows and lower highs. Consequently, the Average Directional Movement Index (ADX) has slumped over the past few days and it even further dipped below 20 with coin facing rejection at the $135 zone. On the brighter side, the ADX curve is now seeing some recovery and went for an uptrend. Overall, it’s looking bullish for the crypto as of press time with the resistance zone falling in between $135 to $175.

253807,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/?p=243663,1658491369,All You Need To Know About Using Dogecoin On Your Phone,"Now you can do it from your phone, too. Whether you own an iPhone or an Android, there are plenty of mobile-friendly exchanges and wallets you can use to start trading Dogecoin. In this guide, we will walk you through everything you need to know about using Dogecoin on your mobile device. Before we jump into the guide, we want to make sure that you understand what Dogecoin is, what its key features are, and why you should consider investing in DOGE or using the crypto for payments, even in a world where new altcoins pop up every day. What Dogecoin Is And How You Can Use It Dogecoin is an open-source, peer-to-peer digital currency with a strong community behind it. Created in 2013 by Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, DOGE started out as a meme. The Shiba Inu dog from the Doge Meme became the coin’s mascot, and the altcoin quickly became popular among the crypto community on sheer hype alone. Today, Dogecoin is one of the most popular altcoins, but you might still be wondering – is there more to this coin than just its memе-worthiness? Dogecoin’s key features include: Fast transaction times Infinite supply Extremely low fees Popularity and a strong community Dogecoin’s popularity did start because it was a meme. However, the DOGE team has been working on some serious development, which has helped the altcoin gain even more traction. Of course, we can’t underestimate DOGE’s ultimate supporter, Elon Musk. His tweets about the coin have helped propel the coin to new heights – plus, Tesla even accepts it as payment. That’s right, thanks to Elon’s continuous support of the altcoin, you can buy a Tesla with Dogecoin. But what else is the crypto good for? Dogecoin Use Cases (Spoiler Alert: They Are Growing By The Minute) Dogecoin is a fun, new, and rapidly growing form of digital currency. And, as with any other currency, you can use it to buy goods and services, or trade it for other assets (both other cryptocurrencies or traditional currency like US dollars). What can you buy with Dogecoin? Lots of things! A new Tesla car is one example, of course, but did you know that you can also use your Dogecoins to pay for goods and services by companies like GameStop, Newegg, and Twitch? In fact, DOGE is one of the best cryptos for gaming enthusiasts in 2022. Whether you’re tipping your favorite streamers or grabbing a new game at GameStop, you can use Dogecoin to do it. What else is possible? Gambling is another popular use for Dogecoin. After all, what’s more fun than using your DOGE to play casino games or bet on sports? Crypto casinos tend to have lower house edges and offer better returns to their players. You can find a growing number of casinos that accept Dogecoin in 2022, and we’re sure the coin will become increasingly popular with gamblers in the years to come. What about investing? Many people are using Dogecoin as an investment or they trade it, hoping to make money on the price swings. While it’s not backed by any government or central bank, DOGE has shown itself to be a very interesting asset over the years. This, combined with its low price and high potential for growth, makes it an attractive investment for many people. Still, remember that DOGE was never created to be speculative – hence the unlimited supply. So, keep in mind that it is a risky investment and only put in what you’re willing to lose. How to Use Dogecoin on Your Phone Convinced already? We thought as much. Dogecoin is one of the cryptos that we get the most questions about. And, considering we do virtually everything on our phones these days, it makes sense that many people want to know how to use Dogecoin on their phones. Well, the good news is that it’s not as difficult as you might think. First, you need a wallet to store your Dogecoin. If you don’t have one, we recommend that you sign up with a Dogecoin wallet provider such as Exodus. Once you’ve signed up, you can download the wallet app for either your iPhone or Android device. We’ll give you our recommendations for mobile-friendly wallets in a bit, but for now, make sure there is an app to begin with. Mobile browsers are not as secure as you might think and accessing your wallet via your phone’s browser could lead to your funds being stolen. Wallet installed and ready to go, you will need to buy some Dogecoin. You do that at a crypto exchange – it’s not unlike using a currency exchange, but you are changing your dollars or pounds for cryptos instead. We use and recommend Kraken and Binance, but there are also exchanges … Continued The post All You Need To Know About Using Dogecoin On Your Phone appeared first on Cryptoknowmics-Crypto News and Media Platform .",POSITIVE,DOGE,ALTCOIN | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | TRADING,,0,0,Cryptoknowmics,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/all-you-need-to-know-about-using-dogecoin-on-your-phone/?utm_source=rss&#038;utm_medium=rss&#038;utm_campaign=all-you-need-to-know-about-using-dogecoin-on-your-phone,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png

The 24-hour trading volume of Apecoin is $670 Million, indicating a hike of 10%. Past Performance of APE The Apecoin (APE) price action shows a bullish reversal from the $3 mark and accounts for a 100% jump in the last month. The market price exceeds the $6.5 mark, and the 50-day SMA reflects a solid uptrend in motion. However, the uptrend is contained within an ascending resistance trendline, and the recent reversal from the $5.70 mark prepares for a breakout attempt. Source – Tradingview APE Technical Analysis The Apecoin (APE) prices show the daily candle challenging the ascending trendline with a 6.45% growth today. However, traders hoping to ride the breakout rally must wait for a price action confirmation. The RSI indicator reflects a continuous increase in the underlying bullishness as the RSI slope challenges the overbought boundary. Hence, the indicator demonstrates a high likelihood of a bullish breakout. Furthermore, the MACD indicator reflects a remarkable increase in the buying price as the positive histograms intensify. Moreover, the positive trend in the fast and slow lines represents an uptrend that is here to stay. In a nutshell, the APE technical analysis suggests a high likelihood of a trendline breakout. Upcoming Trend If the buying pressure propels the Apecoin (APE) prices above the resistance trendline, the prices will break the $7 mark. Hence, traders can expect the breakout rally to reach the $9 mark. However, if the trendline starts a bearish reversal, a downfall to the $6 mark seems inevitable.

42374233,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvYIsX,1658490257,"Three Arrows Capital Founders Say Terra, GBTC Trades Led to Fund Blowup: Report","Trades involving the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), Terra’s luna (LUNA) and terraUSD (UST) tokens eventually led to the blowup of beleaguered crypto fund Three Arrows Capital, its founders told Bloomberg.  The fund's founders Kyle Davies and Su Zhu had previously confirmed they took on some $200 million in losses related to LUNA and the now-imploded algorithmic stablecoin UST. Prices of the two tokens entered a death spiral in mid-May and fell to nearly zero in the following weeks.  “What we failed to realize was that luna was capable of falling to effective zero in a matter of days and that this would catalyze a credit squeeze across the industry that would put significant pressure on all of our illiquid positions,” Zhu explained. He added that Three Arrows Capital, popularly referred to as 3AC, had failed to flag risks related to Terra.  LUNA lost nearly all of its value over the course of a week in mid-May, while ecosystem algorithmic stablecoin terraUSD (UST) fell to a few pennies after losing its intended peg with the U.S. dollar.  3AC was one of Terra’s most vocal bulls, and was additionally one of the largest holders of GBTC, an institutional bitcoin product.  Grayscale and CoinDesk are independent subsidiaries of the Digital Currency Group (DCG).  As a regulated product, GBTC allowed investors like 3AC to purchase shares directly by giving bitcoin to the trust. Holders could then sell the shares on over-the-counter markets for a premium – which netted a hefty profit for holders and became an attractive trade among investors.  GBTC shares were locked for six months, meaning falling prices led to holders taking on losses instead of profits. GBTC’s premium switched to a discount over the past year, reaching a record discount in June. This meant massive losses for investors like 3AC who piled on billions of dollars worth of exposure to the product. However, using leverage to juice up returns led to tears instead.  GBTC lost value in the past few months amid a market-wide decline. GBTC shares traded at over $34 at the start of this year, before sliding more than 50% to $12 earlier this week.  3AC continued to borrow from lenders expecting a market rebound. This was until bitcoin (BTC) fell to nearly $20,000 in late June, causing the firm’s positions to go awry and making it unable to repay any loans. The fund lost money on luna, its GBTC shares traded at a discount, and overall market declines meant all altcoin token holdings fell drastically in value.  “That was extremely painful for us,” Zhu said, referring to bitcoin’s fall. “That ended up being kind of the nail in the coffin.”  Investors are claiming that the defunct fund still owes them $2.8 billion. However, a 1,157-page court filing released on Monday shows individual claims worth over $1 billion.

We had all of our, almost all of our assets in there. And then in the good times we did the best. And then in the bad times we lost the most,” Davies said.

Responding to questions about what took the firm down, Zhu attributed the firm’s failure to overconfidence born of a multiyear bull market that infected not just him and Davies but almost every credit system in the industry.

The report also described the firm’s liquidity and credit risks. The company indicated that $600 million of the $1.8 billion outstanding loans to customers are uncollateralized.

Those rules require the company to retain at least 10% of the total amount owed to clients in inventory for eventual return upon their request. In addition, it will keep at least 50 percent of owed funds in locations where customers can retrieve them and return them within a week. At least 90% of the money owed to customers will be available immediately, either in inventory or loans repayable within a year.

42374244,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvYJ3r,1658486620,Binance Says It Doesn't Stake or Lend 'Locked' Dogecoin,"Binance clarified that coins deposited in its recently launched staking program for proof-of-work (PoW) token dogecoin (DOGE) and litecoin (LTC) would remain with the exchange and won't be lent out for generating additional yield.  ""There is no on-chain staking of LTC and DOGE for network validation since these are non-proof-of-stake tokens,"" a Binance spokesperson said. ""The user funds remain with Binance, and we have very strict risk management controls to ensure their security.""  The explanation comes after several prominent social media influencers and investors disapproved of the program after it went live on Tuesday, questioning how it is possible to stake coins like DOGE and LTC, as their parent blockchains use a proof-of-work consensus mechanism.  ""Oh boy. @Binance announced another ""holding"" program. This one is referred to as ""Locked Staking,"" and it allows you to ""stake"" LTC and Dogecoin. How is that even possible when #LTC and #Dogecoin are PoW cryptos,"" a popular dogecoin-focused Twitter handle Mishaboar tweeted on Tuesday.  Dogecoin, litecoin and bitcoin blockchains use the energy-intensive proof-of-work mechanism, with miners solving a computational problem to verify transactions as opposed to the proof-of-stake (PoS), which requires market participants, or validators, to stake or hold a minimum number of coins to validate transactions in return for rewards.  Therefore, DOGE, LTC and BTC holders don't have the option of staking their coins on a network individually or through an exchange in return for rewards. Only native tokens of PoS blockchains like Polkadot, Cardano and Avalanche can be staked to earn rewards, representing a passive income. (Ethereum, which was originally designed as a PoW blockchain, is in the process of becoming a PoS blockchain).  Binance has updated the frequently asked questions page on its website, explaining the process of locked staking for the so-called non proof-of-stake coins.  The locked staking program is scheduled to last for 120 days, meaning the users who subscribed will have this position for 120 days. While the early redemption option is available, users seeking the same will have to forfeit the rewards. The subscription window for this campaign is set to end on July 26.  The program is said to offer up to 10% annualized percentage yield on deposits with rewards paid daily. Some investors are worried that the double-digit yield may be too good to be true and the exchange might use the locked coins elsewhere to generate additional income, exposing user funds to potential risks.  Dogecoin's creator, Shibetoshi Nakamoto, expressed displeasure, calling the product offering 10% yield unsustainable in a sarcastic tweet. The aversion to high-yielding products is understandable, considering the collapse of Terra in May and recent liquidity issues at several lending and borrowing firms and exchanges. Terra's Anchor Protocol offered a 20% yield on deposits of stablecoin UST earlier this year.  In response to these concerns, Binance's spokesperson said, ""We do not stake or lend out users' LTC and DOGE and the APR (annual percentage rate) rewards for this campaign come directly from us.""  Dogecoin traded at 7.12 cents at press time, representing a 1% gain on the day. The meme-focused cryptocurrency has dropped 58% this year.

248782,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=496452,1658482576,How Crypto and Web 3.0 Will Impact YouTube,"The numerous ways cryptocurrency and Web3 have been beneficial to industries are sometimes underrepresented. Businesses, entrepreneurs, investors, and individuals are reaping the rewards of recent advancements in the Web3 space, and, not to be left out, the video and streaming industry is already starting to reap the benefits of its ongoing integration with Web3. With the introduction of a Watch-to-Earn concept (W2E), Web3 aims to revolutionize the video space from an industry focused on profit for corporations to one that is more inclusive. Web3 is creating a system of balance by updating a system where only creators and the big platforms earn – leaving out viewers – to a more inclusive system where viewers get rewarded for watching their favorite creators on video platforms such as YouTube. How Web3 is Creating a Beneficial Ecosystem With Video Hosting & Streaming Here is where we witness the incorporation of blockchain into an estimated $80.83 billion video streaming industry. The coalition of these powerful forces will create fertile ground for the growth of a technologically-driven video streaming ecosystem, where equal opportunity for every user to become a team player exists, including viewers. In addition, bringing Web3 into video industries such as YouTube will positively revamp some foundational operational policies and norms. The following benefits will accompany the introduction of Web3 to the video industry: Decentralization: transactions are over a decentralized network due to blockchain technology which is a feature of Web3. Autonomy: the platforms will be free of control by the government and corporations as transactions will be conducted over a decentralized network where each individual involved has control over their assets. Abolishment of third-party data selling: with the introduction of Web3 to video streaming, there will be no need for third parties since it is a decentralized network. Hence, users’ data will be secure from infiltration or risks of getting sold. Free speech: content creators and viewers will express their opinions without being threatened since each user has equal rights. Absence of arbitrary censorship: passing purposeless censorship on content will be curbed with the incorporation of Web3 into the video industry, since no entity or individual holds centralized power. W2E: XCAD Seeks to Reward Creators and Viewers on YouTube The intersection of Web3 and video streaming will be made feasible with W2E technologies such as XCAD, which gives users an opportunity to earn passive income from an activity that most internet users do every day. XCAD’s browser plugin works on YouTube to reward users with cryptocurrency as they use the platform. XCAD allows creators to create and distribute customized crypto and NFT tokens to their fanbase that can sell on trading platforms. Viewers will also earn cryptocurrency tokens for streaming videos on YouTube from their favorite content makers. Crucially, as in the case of XCAD Network, these Web3 technologies can work hand-in-hand with existing platforms like YouTube and Twitch, delivering their own features without disrupting or competing with the existing platform. Final Thoughts The system Web3 is creating for video platforms will tremendously impact the outdated ways and breathe an air of newness into the video industry. Building a community where creators and viewers can earn cryptocurrency passively from everyday activity, without undergoing confusing procedures, is a game-changer for video content platforms. With the advent of Web3, video hosting and streaming can be fair and decentralized; a winning concept on all fronts.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/company/how-crypto-and-web-3-0-will-impact-youtube/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

DAOs are entities that have no central leadership, and are owned and governed by their members. Their decisions are carried out by software rather than by human managers.  “Jump Crypto’s experience in data-driven trading and liquidity provisioning will complement Synthetix’s mission to become the liquidity backbone for on-chain derivatives,” developers said in a tweet on Thursday night.  The Chicago-based trading firm is expected to work closely with the Synthetix network to provide liquidity across listed assets and product feedback. Jump Crypto provides liquidity services and investments, and it participates in project governance.  Synthetix didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.  SNX rose to as much as $3.37 during Asian trading hours before profit-taking caused the price to decline to $3.25 at press time. The tokens have gained over 19% in the past week, but only 4% compared with the past month after a market-wide decline pushed prices to monthly lows of $2.13 in early July.  However, the fundamentals remain strong. Since March, Synthetix has recorded trading volumes of over $2.8 billion, mainly from its atomic swaps and perpetual swaps products. Atomic swaps refer to an exchange of cryptocurrencies from separate blockchains. These use Uniswap and Chainlink live prices to ensure traders' accurate execution.  Popular products on Synthetix include ether (ETH), bitcoin (BTC) and chainlink (LINK) token derivatives traded against Synthetix USD (SUSD), a dollar-pegged stablecoin.

Korean Metaverse Firm Anipen Raises US$8 Million in Series C Round,"South Korean metaverse platform Anipen attracted financing totaling over 11 billion Korean raised ($8.3 million) in its Series C round before its anticipated initial public offering (IPO) next year. Medici Investment, Ulmus Investment, and the Korea Development Bank are among the investors (KDB). With the financing, Anipen will increase its global alliances and develop its metaverse content services. Anipen is a profound learning-based metaverse platform developer with a focus on artificial intelligence (AI), augmented reality (AR), and extended reality (XR). Anipen’s Three Dimensional Mobile Application Its premier service, a three-dimensional mobile application called AnibeaR, enables users to produce AR-enhanced video material with the help of well-known kid’s cartoon characters like Hello Kitty and the Teletubbies. The developer of the metaverse gathered investments of 13 billion won last year. As soon as the company’s assets reach 20 billion won, it intends to end its Series C financing.

It was unveiled by Ifland’s operator, telecom behemoth SK Telecom. Users who meet attendance requirements and accomplish in-metaverse missions will receive points from the Ifland 2.0 economy that will eventually have “cash-like utility.” Thanks to the change, users can create costumes and other goods to sell for a profit.

42374219,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvYIhD,1658481263,"Three Arrows Capital Founders Break Their Silence, Look to Move to Dubai: Report","The founders of insolvent crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, Su Zhu and Kyle Davies, have broken their silence in an interview with Bloomberg.  The duo described the collapse as ""regrettable,"" but denied claims they pulled money from the fund before its collapse, according to the report.  The collapse of Three Arrows, also known as 3AC, was seemingly triggered by the fall of the Terra ecosystem and sent ripples in the crypto market. Investors are claiming the defunct fund still owes them $2.8 billion. On Monday, a 1,157-page court filing revealed the extent of the hedge fund's debt following the implosion, with individual claims worth over $1 billion.  The founders declined to say where they were, but one of the lawyers on the call said their ultimate destination is the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the report added.  “Given that we had planned to move the business to Dubai, we have to go there soon to assess whether we move there as originally planned or if the future holds something different for us,” Zhu added.  In the report, Zhu said the reason for the fund's collapse was placing leveraged trades with hope that the crypto market would rebound to the upside. He compared 3AC's implosion to that of Celsius Network, a crypto lending firm that froze withdrawals and filed for bankruptcy protection after it failed to keep enough liquidity to honor customer redemptions.  One of 3AC's largest positions that went sour was in the Terra ecosystem and its token LUNA, which effectively collapsed to zero in May. The pair insists they are cooperating with authorities while trying to keep a low profile.  “For Kyle and I, there’s so many crazy people in crypto that kind of made death threats or all this kind of noise,” Zhu said. “We feel that it’s just the interest for everyone if we can be physically secured and keep a low profile.”  Three Arrows Capital did not immediately respond to CoinDesk's request for a comment.

Staked ether’s discount to ether (ETH) has narrowed, which suggests some liquidity stress may have passed, the bank's report said, adding that the “acute deleveraging phase” has now ended given many of the large brokers and market makers in the sector have disclosed their exposures.  In a further positive sign, stablecoin outflows have been stemmed, the bank said, and outflows from crypto exchange-traded funds (ETF) have also stabilized in recent weeks. Exchange and futures leverage is also “benign,” it added.  Volatility in crypto markets in May and June resulted in a number of “intra-market dislocations,” one of which was the difference between the price of bitcoin (BTC) on Coinbase (COIN) in U.S. dollars versus that on rival exchange Binance in tether (USDT), the note said.  The Coinbase price is normally at a premium, which could reflect new entrants or institutional demand, but the price turned to a discount in May, the note said. This “Coinbase premium” is now also returning towards historical levels, which suggests reduced crypto market stress, the note added.  Citi says crypto markets are probably too small and isolated to have spillover effects into the wider financial markets or the economy, but they can still impact investor sentiment. Contagion fears have likely peaked, at least for the time being, the note added.

252205,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=496410,1658480451,Why Hidden Bitcoin Bulls Could Be Ready To Charge,"Bitcoin price is attempting its first major recovery since plunging below $20,000 per BTC during the recent crypto market contagion. A hidden bullish divergence could indicate that although the selloff was extreme, bulls have been lying in the wait and will soon begin to charge. Here is closer look at the potential bullish continuation signal on BTCUSD weekly price charts. Crypto Bulls Lie In Wait, Soon Could Be Ready To Charge Bitcoin became a household name in late 2017 after reaching nearly $20,000 per coin and sent the entire crypto market on a historical bull run. After a long bear market, prices were expected to appreciate significantly. The now infamous stock-to-flow model projected the top cryptocurrency to have reached well over $100,000 per BTC by now. Yet instead, prices retraced back to 2017 levels. Many altcoins corrected back to prices from 2013. Related Reading | How Weekly RSI Could Suggest The Bitcoin Bottom Is In Although the selloff took more than 74% out of the price of Bitcoin, patient bulls may have been waiting and planning their next move. A hidden bullish divergence on BTCUSD weekly RSI has formed from the Black Thursday low that took the leading cryptocurrency to under $4,000 per coin. The plunge back then acted as a spring resulting in the 2020 bull run and new all-time highs throughout 2021. With a potential continuation signal on the weekly RSI, is Bitcoin ready to pick up where it left off? The weekly RSI reached the most oversold conditions ever | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com Does This Bitcoin RSI Hidden Bullish Divergence Signal “Continuation?” The weekly Relative Strength Index is exhibiting a potential hidden bullish divergence. In the example above, it demonstrates that an indicator makes a lower low, while price action makes a higher low. This type of behavior is typically indicative of continuation in the primary trend – which for Bitcoin has almost always been up. The same weekly RSI has also reached the most oversold conditions in the cryptocurrency’s short price history. Even better for bulls, the RSI has risen back out of oversold territory and above a reading of 30. The chart above also depicts the RSI potentially breaching the RSI-based moving average. Related Reading | Bitcoin Weekly RSI Sets Record For Most Oversold In History, What Comes Next? If Bitcoin is to continue its bull run and pick up where it left off, the first major zone to reclaim is $29,000. If BTCUSD can reenter the multi-year trading range, bulls could take a shot at the other side of the range near 2021 all-time highs. But it all depends on this bullish divergence confirming, which is only something we’ll truly know in hindsight. Weekly #Bitcoin RSI analysis could suggest a bottom is in.

On the brighter side, AVAX/USD is looking solid and rising following yesterday’s plunge which suggests a correction before a potential uptrend. AVAX is currently trading at $25.10, up 7 percent in the last seven days, data from Coingecko show, Friday. But people should be on the lookout for the $25 zone. If the price can go back to that level or above that range, then there is a high probability for a bull run. Suggested Reading | Binance Coin Trading Volume Up 35% As BNB Spikes To $274 Will AVAX Continue Its Retracement Or Maintain An Upside? A week ago, AVAX was seen to have bounced back following its wedge formation. A breakout was also hinted following a strong consistent rally. Now, Avalanche was able to run a strong breakout right above the resistance line. It was a robust upside but quite limited following its recent pullback. It had its weekly high set at $26.30 but maneuvered a slight retracement showing the current market condition. So, the question now is if AVAX will continue its retracement or go all-in with its upside? The recent breakout of AVAX is a positive sign that the price has surpassed a pivotal restriction point. The most recent reversal of AVAX happened right after the Money Flow Index (MFI) has intercepted the distribution zone. There was an amplification of selling pressure seen in the crypto market during the last few days which gave the bulls some breathing space following their latest run. However, this deprived them of the opportunity to go higher. AVAX total market cap at $7.05 billion on the daily chart | Source: TradingView.com The current retracement depicts the HODLing activity of majority of AVAX holders which could be a preparation towards bullish recovery after it slumped in June. Nevertheless, AVAX is seen to grow stronger due to its aggressive network expansion. There is a robust development activity going in which has been maintained by Avalance this July which encourages strong flow of AVAX and aptitude to maintain a ferocious price action despite pullbacks.

The FSC told Forkast News on Friday that it had issued a letter to the local banking association in early July, which asked credit card agencies to stop bringing on crypto platforms as merchants.  In the letter, the regulator had reportedly warned of the risks associated with virtual assets, and is giving credit card firms three months to comply with the new requirements.  The FSC also said that credit cards cannot be used for online gambling, stocks, futures, options and other transactions, according to the report.  In recent months, regulators around the world have been speeding up crypto rules as global crypto markets took a big hit this year, with several prominent entities liquidating and billions of dollars leaving the industry.  After China's crackdown on crypto in 2021, Taiwan saw a rush of activity and was slated to emerge as the region's new crypto hub. However, the local crypto industry has gone quiet since.

Terra Co-Founder Home Raided in Seoul According to a Bloomberg report from today, the home of Terraform Labs co-founder Daniel Shin in Seoul was raided by prosecutors as part of a broader investigation over allegations that fraud caused the collapse of the TerraUSD (UST) stablecoin. Earlier this week, prosecutors investigated 15 crypto offices, including seven local exchanges such as Upbit, Bithumb, and Gopax. The series of raids on crypto exchanges and offices on Wednesday included Terra Shin’s home and his payment app company Chai Corp, the Seoul Southern District Prosecutors Office said. The move comes just a month after the authorities banned current and former employees of Terraform Labs from leaving the country. They are also investigating whether the company’s other co-founder, Do Kwon, evaded taxes by moving profits from cryptocurrency transactions to an offshore account. However, since TerraUSD imploded, Shin has put a notice on his app distancing himself from Do Kwon and TerraLabs. Despite the investigations and allegations, Kwon has gone on to launch Terra 2.0. Following the Terra ecosystem collapse due to the de-pegging of the UST stablecoin in May, about $40 billion of investor funds were wiped off the markets. The post Terra Founder’s Home Raided, S.

Buterin claims the Ethereum “merge” could make the blockchain move to a less energy-intensive and more effective manner of recording transactions. The difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum, according to Buterin, is that Bitcoiners believe Bitcoin to be 80% complete. In contrast, Ethereans believe Ethereum to be 40% complete, he said in his opening remarks at the Ethereum Community Conference (EthCC) in Paris. He said that the long-planned “merge” technical upgrade by Ethereum will cause the 40 percent figure to increase. Buterin said, “Ethereum can go up to 55% complete after the merge,” “We’re getting close, which is amazing.” Ethereum Merge Aims For September The Ethereum merge is expected to happen around September 19, according to an announcement made by Ethereum developers last week. Although the transfer to the new mechanism, known as Proof-of-Stake (PoS), will strengthen Ethereum, Buterein called the shift “a long and hard process.” He acknowledged that Proof-of-Stake had limitations, such as weak subjectivity, despite being safer than Proof-of-Effort. Buterin still believes that the positives outweigh the negatives. Following the merge, Ethereum’s roadmap calls for a four-part upgrade, dubbed “surge, verge, purge, and splurge,” to enhance the network’s security and decentralization. After this roadmap, Ethereum will be a system that is considerably more scalable, according to Buterin. Ethereum will eventually be able to handle 100,000 transactions per second.

Face a Hit From Bitcoin: Bloomberg Report","Three corporations, Tesla Inc., MicroStrategy Inc., and Block Inc., suffered losses on their Bitcoin holdings in the second quarter that were expected to total $5 billion, as per the Bloomberg report. The decrease in value is due to the cryptocurrency’s price falling by 59% from June 1 to June 30. Bloomberg calculated the loss based on the corporations’ prior statements regarding their Bitcoin holdings. Bitcoin Loss Hits Block, Tesla, MicroStrategy The price demonstrates the risk faced by businesses who opt to store some of their corporate treasury in volatile cryptocurrencies instead of more secure short-term treasuries or cash. Although Bitcoin has slightly recovered from its low of under $18,000 last month, there is no assurance it will ever reach its November high of almost $68,000. MicroStrategy and Block have seen roughly half of their worth lost this year, while Tesla’s stock is down 30%. Well-known cryptocurrency supporters lead all three businesses. One of the riskiest decisions was made by MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor, whose company spent roughly $4 billion to purchase 129,699 Bitcoins. The price change decreased the tokens’ value by $3.4 billion in the second quarter. Early last year, Elon Musk’s Tesla purchased $1.5 billion of the cryptocurrency and promptly sold some of that stock at a profit. Block, run by Bitcoin enthusiast and Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, had $366 million worth of that coin as of March 31, per a company statement. It liquidated 75% of its remaining shares in the second quarter since it was unknown how long Covid lockdowns in China would endure. The projected holdings of Tesla and Square, valued at roughly $18,731 on June 30, resulted in combined paper losses for the three businesses of about $5 billion.

However, Coinbase denied the agency’s claim saying that the platform does not list any securities. Coinbase Does Not List Securities The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) used its first insider-trading case to declare nine digital tokens as “securities.” The nine crypto assets in question are: Power Ledger’s POWR token, Flexa’s AMP token, Rally’s RLY token, DerivaDEX’s DDX token, XY Labs’ XYO token, Rari Capital’s RGT token, Liechtenstein Cryptoassets Exchange’s LCX token, DFX Finance’s DFX token, and Kromatika Finance’s KROM token. The move comes just before the securities regulator filed a complaint on Thursday, alleging a former Coinbase product manager engaged in insider trading by giving his brother and friend tips on which assets the exchange planned to list in the near future. The regulatory agency also stated that nine of the crypto assets listed were securities. However, Coinbase denied those claims saying that none of those listed assets are securities. “Coinbase has a rigorous process to analyze and review each digital asset before making it available on our exchange, a process that the SEC itself has reviewed,” the company clarified. “This process includes an analysis of whether the asset could be considered to be a security and also considers regulatory compliance and information security aspects of the asset. To be explicit, the majority of assets that we review are not ultimately listed on Coinbase,” it added.

42395140,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASXHrK,1658471249,SEC Hasn’t Subpoenaed Binance About BNB: FOIA Response,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) “probe” into whether Binance’s BNB token is a security might just be the commission asking questions, as Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao has claimed.  A Freedom of Information Act request sent by CoinDesk to the SEC about a “subpoena sent to Binance by the SEC with regards to an investigation into the BNB token” came back with no responsive documents.  “Based on the information you provided in your letter, we conducted a thorough search of the SEC’s various systems of records, but did not locate or identify any information responsive to your request,” an SEC FOIA officer wrote in the commission’s response to CoinDesk.  This suggests there was no legally binding subpoena that would compel the exchange to produce documents and make personnel available for questioning.  Bloomberg reported in June that “investigators are examining if the 2017 initial coin offering [of BNB] amounted to the sale of a security that should have been registered with the agency.”  At CoinDesk’s Consensus 2022 event in June, Zhao said that Binance is in regular contact with authorities about its products and denied that the company had been subpoenaed.  Zhao has been a frequent critic of the media, sometimes equating reporting to playing a game of “telephone.” He has said publicly that he’d no longer give interviews to news outlets that use “clickbait titles.”  BNB is Binance’s exchange token, meaning holders get a discount on Binance’s trading fees, and the utility token behind the Binance (BNB) chain — which has a market cap of $471 million and is home to a variety of decentralized finance (DeFi) projects.  While BNB does not confer equity in Binance, its value fluctuates with the perceived success or failures of Binance on the market.  Would the SEC admit there’s a BNB investigation?  Should there be an active investigation into Binance, the SEC could withhold disclosing documents under Exemption 7, one of the exemptions available to it. The exemption prohibits the release of documents compiled for law enforcement purposes that “could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings.”  But in order not to tip its hand to the presence of an investigation, the SEC will occasionally answer with a “can neither confirm nor deny” response.  After all, a response withholding documents due to the presence of an investigation could be materially damaging to a company even if the investigation came back empty-handed. Hence the need for a “neither confirm nor deny” policy to maintain the confidentiality of investigations.  Colloquially, this response is known as a “Glomar,” named after the Howard Hughes-owned ship the CIA contracted to hunt for a sunken Soviet submarine. Journalists at the Los Angeles Times didn’t buy the cover story, and pushed under the then-nascent Freedom of Information Act to get more details.  They were blocked with a “can neither confirm nor deny” response, not a specific national security exemption, and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sued alleging abuse of the Act.  Courts eventually sided with the CIA, and the term “Glomarization” was born in the ruling.  Do Kwon subpoena got 'glomared'  Last September, one of the buzzing topics wasn’t a potential subpoena of Binance, but rather if Terra co-founder Do Kwon was subpoenaed by the SEC while attending Messari’s Mainnet conference.  Initially, Kwon denied he had been subpoenaed. But he later backtracked slightly over legal quibbles on whether the service in New York was in fact proper. In the end, it turned out he was served, and Terra lost an appeal that contested the validity of service.  But, at the time, the SEC responded to a FOIA about Kwon’s subpoena with a Glomar response.  “We do not mean to imply in any way that records responsive to your request exist,” the SEC wrote at the time.  For the response to CoinDesk’s FOIA about an investigation into Binance, the language was more clear: The records don’t exist.  As for Terra, it turned out the subpoena would be the least of Kwon’s problems a few months later.",NEUTRAL,BNB,EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | BNB | TOKEN SALE,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/07/22/sec-hasnt-subpoenaed-binance-about-bnb-foia-response,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c0feaca696c030d22ca2666186846c16f81c046f-5333x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Source – Tradingview NEAR Technical Analysis The NEAR token prices sustain above the 50-day SMA and the $4 mark and form a morning star pattern that may shortly break above the $4.75 resistance level. However, a lack of bullish support in the trading volume warns of another supply dump. The RSI indicator maintains an optimistic outlook for the upcoming trend as the RSI slope spikes into the nearly overbought zone. Moreover, the support from the 14-day SMA aims to keep the uptrend moving. Furthermore, the MACD indicator reflects a remarkable increase in buying pressure as the positive histograms intensify.

The federal authorities said the case was the first crypto insider trading scheme on record. Ex-Coinbase Product Manager Arrested in Insider Trading Scheme According to a statement from the Department of Justice (DoJ), Coinbase product manager Ishan Wahi, his brother Nikhil Wahi and Ishan’s friend Sameer Ramani have been charged with wire fraud conspiracy and wire fraud, both of which revolve around crypto insider trading based on confidential Coinbase information. Ishan, who had access to confidential information about the listing schedule of assets on Coinbase, would tip Nikhil or his associate Sameer. The duo would then place trades on those assets, anticipating the public disclosure of the announcement concerning the listing of the assets. The three allegedly profited at least $1.5 million in illegal trades from 25 different crypto assets on 14 occasions, from June 2021 to April 2022, according to the DoJ. “Today’s charges are a further reminder that Web3 is not a law-free zone,” Damian Williams, a U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, stated in the release. “Just last month, I announced the first ever insider trading case involving NFTs, and today I announce the first ever insider trading case involving cryptocurrency markets. Our message with these charges is clear: fraud is fraud is fraud, whether it occurs on the blockchain or on Wall Street.” The charges follow a similar case filed in June, in which the DoJ alleged an employee at NFT marketplace OpenSea profited from his role in selecting which NFTs would be promoted on the front web page of OpenSea.

Over the last 24 hours, the coin depleted by 9%. The current support level for SOL stood at $38. The price of the asset registered a month high after the massive rally that took place on July 13 . Technical outlook for Solana pictured the bears taking over. After Bitcoin dipped on its chart by 6% over the last day, altcoins too had the same effect on their charts. Buying strength of Solana depreciated considerably flashing negative price action. After a relief rally, it is usually not uncommon for coins to retrace on their charts. If buying strength gains strength, then Solana might again break past its current price level and aim for the overhead price ceiling. If SOL manages to move the $44 price mark, a visit to the $50 doesn’t seem too difficult. Buying strength and broader market strength will help Solana regain price momentum. The global cryptocurrency market cap today is $1.07 Trillion with a 5.1% negative change in the last 24 hours. Solana Price Analysis: Four Hour Chart SOL was trading at $41 at the time of writing. The bulls lost momentum once it hit the $46 price mark. Overhead resistance for Solana was at $48, a move above which could help Solana touch $50 and even go above it. A fall from the current price mark will ensure that SOL touches the $38 mark and then touch the $30 support line. If buying strength maintains momentum, SOL might hover around the same price area before it attempts to rise further. Amount of SOL traded increased signifying a rise in buying strength which can be an indication of a recovery on the four hour chart. Technical Analysis The altcoin’s buying strength remained low, sellers were dominating the price action on the chart. In accordance with the same, the Relative Strength Index displayed the same emotion. RSI was pictured underneath the half-line and that meant decreased buying strength. Although there was a fall in the number of buyers, the indicator noted an uptick which can be considered bullish. Price of SOL was below the 20-SMA, which indicated that in the short-term time duration sellers were driving the price momentum. Solana was however above the 50-SMA and 200-SMA which signified that bullish action could witness a rebound. Suggested Reading | Solana Adds 70% More Shine – Can SOL Keep The Light Coming? SOL captured the fall in buying strength, it displayed sell signal. Awesome Oscillator depicts price direction and momentum along trend reversals. AO formed red sell signal bars which is a sell signal for the asset. Parbolic SAR also indicates price direction, dotted lines above the candlestick meant that the price direction was negative at the time of writing. For Solana to move upwards, buying strength will need to rise on the chart.

The technical analysis of the coin still points towards a chance of bulls reclaiming levels above the $0.07 mark. Bitcoin too retraced over the last 24 hours and was priced at $22,000. Most altcoins follow the same price trajectory. Buying strength faded on the chart but buyers still outnumbered sellers in the market at press time. If Dogecoin continues on its present price trajectory then soon buying strength will be replaced by selling strength. DOGE displayed a relief rally and there is always a chance of retracement before the coin again moves on the upside. It is to be seen if Dogecoin reclaims higher levels, however, buying strength remains crucial at this junction for the meme-coin. Dogecoin Price Analysis: Four Hour Chart DOGE was trading at $0.0686 after the slight retracement as seen at the time of writing. The coin has managed to secure its position on the $0.0600 support line. The overhead resistance for the coin was at $0.0726, moving above which it could witness some resistance at $0.0781. If the coin picks up momentum then it could even trade above the $0.0840 mark. Further southbound movement, can push Dogecoin to $0.0575 and then below the support level of $0.0500. Trading level of Dogecoin fell indicating a fall in buying strength which is a sign of declining bullishness. Technical Analysis DOGE noted a sharp decline in the number of buyers on the four hour chart. Despite Dogecoin visiting the overbought zone, buyers could not hold onto the momentum. A slight decline in the buying strength can make selling pressure stronger. The Relative Strength Index dipped on the chart and was close to the half-line which meant that there was a fall in buying pressure. Price of Dogecoin was peeking slightly below the 20-SMA line which signified that sellers could soon start to drive the price momentum on the chart. The meme-coin however was above the 50-SMA and 200-SMA which indicated that bullish momentum didn’t completely fade out. Related reading | Dogecoin Emerges A Top Gainer Despite Musk Vs. Twitter Legal Tussle The meme-coin displayed signs of change in price action on the four hour chart. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence depicts the price momentum and reversals in the same. MACD displayed a bearish crossover and formed red histograms on the chart. This reading is tied to sell signal along with a flip in the current price direction. Similarly, Directional Movement Index also demonstrates price movement and direction. DMI was negative with the -DI line above the +DI line. The Average Directional Index (Red) dipped below the 40-mark signalling that the current price trend was losing vigour at press time. Related Reading | Tesla Ruins Bitcoin Rally?

And sign up for First Mover,our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.  Prices  Hi, I'm James Rubin, here to take you through the day's crypto market highlights and news.  Bitcoin (BTC): $23,144 -.6%  Ether (ETH): $1,578 +3.2%  Biggest Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Cosmos ATOM +13.8% Smart Contract Platform Polygon MATIC +8.6% Smart Contract Platform Avalanche AVAX +5.7% Smart Contract Platform  Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Bitcoin BTC −0.5% Currency Dogecoin DOGE −0.4% Currency  Bitcoin Drops; Altcoins Rise  Bitcoin fell slightly in Thursday trading as investors continued to absorb the aftershocks of Tesla's (TSLA) decision to shed $936 million in bitcoin from its balance sheet during its second quarter.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at about $23,100, down more than a half percentage point over the past 24 hours. The second, consecutive daily decline following an early week rally underscored Tesla CEO Elon Musk's influence among digital asset investors. Musk's utterances about bitcoin and dogecoin (DOGE) have sent markets for those assets intermittently soaring and plunging for much of the past two years.  ""Bitcoin was showing signs of a potentially meaningful breakout, but that quickly came to an end after Tesla reported earnings,"" Oanda Americas Senior Analyst Edward Moya wrote in an email.  Yet, Moya noted that traders should not have been surprised by Musk's support of the sale, given the crypto winter and comments he make a month ago at the Qatar Economic Forum that he had not recommended people invest in crypto.  Moya added optimistically: ""This is not a game changer for bitcoin.""  Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap, was changing hands just below $1,600, up more than 3% over the same period. Other major altcoins were in the green of a mostly dark shade, with Cosmos' ATOM and Polygon's MATIC climbing more than 13% and 8%, respectively, at one point.  Equity indexes rise  Equity markets also rose on Thursday, albeit less robustly than cryptos. The tech-heavy Nasdaq jumped 1.3% while the S&P 500 increased almost a percentage point, respectively. Stocks have found even ground lately amid better-than-expected earnings reports from a number of major brands, most recently Tesla and Netflix (NFLX).  Investors have also been encouraged by reports that the U.S. central bank's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) would raise interest rates by 75 basis points instead of opting for a more robust 100-point hike. The mildly, less hawkish turn has suggested to some observers that inflation may soon stall without the economy plunging into recession. A Thursday report showing jobless claims in the U.S. reaching an eight-month high offered the latest evidence of a more desirable, gradual economic weakening.  Still, rising prices remain a concern in the U.S. and beyond as the European Central Bank raised borrowing costs for the first time in 11 years.  Meanwhile, the crypto industry continued to suffer the fallout from the ongoing bear market, with cryptocurrency exchange Blockchain.com cutting 25% of its workforce – about 150 people. Blockchain.com follows recent layoffs at a number of other large crypto exchanges worldwide, including Coinbase (COIN), Bullish, Bitso and Buenbit.  Other news was more upbeat with banking giant JPMorgan (JPM) saying in a report that demand among retail investors in the crypto market was improving, and that the ""intense phase"" of deleveraging appeared to be over. And decentralized finance (DeFi) trading platform Hashflow closed a $25 million Series A funding round at a valuation of $400 million.  Moya expects trading to remain volatile until the FOMC meets. ""Bitcoin could be in for a choppy period until we get beyond next week’s FOMC decision,"" Moya wrote.  Markets  S&P 500: 3,998 +0.9%  DJIA: 32,036 +0.5%  Nasdaq: 12,059 +1.3%  Gold: $1,719 +1.3%  Insights  Tesla: Wither the Bitcoin Macro Proxy?  By Sam Reynolds  Let’s rewind to the zenith of 2021’s first-quarter bull market. Bitcoin was on an absolute tear and retail investors were clamoring for more and more of it.  But for those uncomfortable with buying bitcoin on an exchange and storing it in a wallet, there wasn’t really any other way of getting exposure to the asset class. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, still, as of mid-2022, hasn’t approved a bitcoin exchange-traded fund. While bitcoin ETFs began trading in Toronto in April of 2021, not every brokerage in the U.S. can access the Toronto stock exchange.  So the idea of the bitcoin macro proxy was born. These are stocks of a company that has exposure to bitcoin and would allow the trader to realize some of bitcoin’s gains without holding the actual asset.  In theory, this is different from companies that are directly involved in the bitcoin industry like miners or payment processors. These firms would need to have bitcoin on the balance sheet for its utility. A bitcoin proxy would have it on the balance sheet for financial gain.  Tesla and MicroStrategy (MSTR) are examples of these proxies. Unlike Block (SQ), the entity formerly known as Square, which is also publicly listed, Tesla and MicroStrategy have no practical use for bitcoin.  For a while, Tesla offered U.S. consumers the option to purchase a vehicle with bitcoin. It's not clear if anyone took the carmaker up on its offer partially because of the complexity of payment but also the unclear tax implications of liquidating bitcoin for a purchase.  So without a practical use for bitcoin, and the impairment costs skyrocketing, Tesla jettisoned $936 million of it (75%) during the last quarter. Company executives cited liquidity concerns as the reason, as sales in China have ground to a halt due to the country’s strict COVID-19 measures.  But this reason is a non-starter as institutional-grade crypto lending services, like Gemini Prime, could have easily fulfilled an order for a few hundred million dollars-for-bitcoin. That’s if Tesla actually believes in the longevity of bitcoin.  And for those who bought Tesla as a bitcoin proxy instead of the coin itself, they would have outperformed crypto. Year to date, bitcoin is down around 50%. Tesla, only down 38%.  Remarkable for a company that at one time in 2021 made more money on its bitcoin investment than from selling cars.
