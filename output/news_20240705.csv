PEPE: Comparing The Profitability Of The Top Meme Coins,"Holders of the top meme coins have witnessed rough price action in the past few weeks. The majority of meme cryptos have crashed hard during the last week, with losses of over 20% in each asset across the board. Particularly, holders of the top meme coins Dogecoin, PEPE, and Shiba Inu have been disappointed, as the price drop means many of them have now fallen out of profitability. Interestingly, IntoTheBlock’s “In/Out Of The Money” metric shows a varying level of profitability in each meme coin, and it seems like SHIB holders are currently feeling the heat the most. Comparing The Profitability Of The Top Meme Coins Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and PEPE are the top OG meme coins. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have grown over the years and are pushing themselves to the very best as they look to upgrade from the meme token status. PEPE, the newest of the bunch, recently joined the ranks after strong rallies in. Related Reading: Bitcoin Completes 9th Test Of $60,000, Where Does Price Go From Here? March and May. However, recent market dynamics have seen these fun-branded cryptocurrencies taking a brutal beating, with each plunging over 20% and over 40% in the past seven and 30 days respectively. Dogecoin, the OG meme coin and king of the meme market, has plummeted by 24% and 41.8% in the past seven and 30 days, respectively. The self-proclaimed “Dogecoin killer,” Shiba Inu, has also lost some of its bites in recent weeks and is down by 23.5% and 49% in the past seven and 30 days, respectively. Even the internet’s favorite frog, PEPE, couldn’t escape the downturn. The meme-inspired crypto has been down by 34.5% and 45.6% in the past seven and 30 days, respectively. IntoTheBlock’s profitability metric follows wallets that are “in the money,” “at the money,” and “out of the money.” “In the money” tracks those making a profit at the current price, while “out the money” tracks those in losses. According to the Global In/Out of the Money, 3.43 million Dogecoin addresses, representing 54.05% of total addresses, are still in profit, while 1.77 million addresses, representing 27.93% of total addresses, are now at a loss. Similarly, 58% of PEPE holders (155,810 addresses) are in the money, while 32.36% (86,940 addresses) are in losses. On the other hand, only 20.47% (274,540 addresses) of SHIB holders are making money at its current price, while a 52.46% majority (703,700 addresses) are swimming in losses.

30486558,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=628117,1720215016,Buy The Dip? XRP Whales Doing Exactly That – Is A Price Rally Next?,"The cryptocurrency market continues to navigate choppy waters, with many digital assets experiencing significant price drops. However, XRP seems to be charting a different course. While the broader market sentiment remains cautious, large investors, often referred to as “whales,” have been quietly accumulating XRP. This bullish behavior by whales, coupled with positive technical indicators, has some analysts predicting a potential surge for XRP in the coming months. Related Reading: Polkadot Under Fire: 20% Price Drop Follows $87 Million Spending Outrage XRP Whales Dive Deep: A Sign Of Confidence Or Opportunism? According to data from Santiment, a blockchain analytics firm, the holdings of XRP whales (addresses holding over 1 billion tokens) have grown from nearly 40% in mid-June to 42% at the time of writing. This significant increase in whale accumulation suggests a growing level of confidence in XRP’s future potential. The recent buying spree by whales could be interpreted in two ways: It could be a sign that they believe XRP is undervalued and poised for a rebound. Alternatively, they might see the current dip as an attractive buying opportunity. While the intentions behind the whale activity remain unclear, the impact is undeniable. The influx of large buy orders can help stabilize the price and even trigger a short-term rally. However, analysts caution that whale activity alone cannot guarantee a sustained price increase. Long-Term Holders Stay Put Beyond whale movements, on-chain analysis offers further insights into XRP’s potential trajectory. Dormant circulation, a metric that tracks the movement of tokens held in long-term storage, paints a promising picture. Currently, the dormant circulation of XRP is low, indicating that long-term holders are not offloading their assets. This suggests a belief in the long-term viability of the Ripple ecosystem and a potential reluctance to sell at current prices. The low dormant circulation is a positive sign. It indicates that long-term holders are holding onto their XRP, which can help prevent a further price decline. This could create a solid foundation for a future price increase. Related Reading: Dogecoin Decimated: $5 Million Liquidation Sparks 14% Price Plunge What Do Technical Charts Say? Technical analysis, which studies historical price data and chart patterns, also offers a glimmer of hope for XRP bulls. The Relative Strength Index (RSI), a momentum indicator, currently suggests that XRP is oversold. This could be a sign that a price rebound is imminent. The price of XRP was $0.41 at the time of writing, data from Coingecko shows. This is a drop of 4.82% over the previous day. However, given the recent whale activity, the value may level off at the indicated price or maybe move toward $0.45. A Cautiously Optimistic Projection While the recent whale accumulation, low dormant circulation, and positive technical indicators paint a cautiously optimistic picture for XRP, the cryptocurrency market remains unpredictable. The success of XRP’s potential surge will hinge on several factors, including broader market sentiment, regulatory clarity surrounding Ripple’s ongoing legal battle with the SEC, and any unforeseen events that could impact the market.

Bitcoin Sentiment On Social Media Has Turned Quite Bearish According to data from the analytics firm Santiment, social media is showing historic levels of FUD amid the market drawdown. The indicator of interest here is the “Social Volume,” which basically tells us about the degree of discussion around a given topic or term that users on the major social media platforms are currently participating in. This metric works by going through posts/threads/messages on these platforms to look for mentions of the keyword. The indicator then counts up the number of posts that contain at least one such mention. Related Reading: Bitcoin Traders Sink Into ‘Fear’ As Price Crashes Below $58,000 The reason the Social Volume doesn’t simply count up the mentions themselves is that mentions alone don’t contain any information about if the trend is being followed across social media as a whole. Sometimes, for example, mentions can be high for a topic, but most of them could be limited to niche circles (that is, inside a few posts). The Social Volume naturally wouldn’t spike in this case, but it would when users across the platforms are making posts about the term. Now, what the analytics firm has done here is that it has applied terms related to sentiment to Social Volume, to differentiate between discussions related to positive and negative sentiments. Here is the chart shared by Santiment that shows how the Social Volume for negative and positive sentiments has changed alongside the recent Bitcoin volatility: To discern the sentiment, the analytics firm has chosen terms such as buy, bottom, and bullish in the case of positive sentiment, and sell, top, and bearish for negative sentiment. From the graph, it’s visible that the Social Volume for the latter type of keywords has observed a huge spike alongside the plunge in the Bitcoin price. This would imply that a large amount of bearish posts have popped up on social media. The indicator has also spiked for terms pertaining to positive sentiment, but clearly, the scale has been lesser than the one for bearish terms. In fact, the latest ratio between sell and buy calls has actually been the largest observed in the year so far. Thus, it would appear that social media users as a whole are feeling FUD towards Bitcoin. This may actually be a positive development for the cryptocurrency, however, as its price has historically been more likely to move in the opposite direction to what the crowd expects. Related Reading: Why Did Bitcoin Plunge Under $58,000? On-Chain Data Says This As is apparent in the chart, buying calls had spiked on a few occasions following price plunges in the past month, but this optimism had only led to a continued decline for the asset.

German government selling Bitcoin, Justin Sun offering to buy, and Mt.Gox settlement could be contributing to the selling pressure. Technical analysis suggests potential support levels, while fundamentals point to future demand from institutions, nations, and younger investors. Thesis Summary Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has experienced a very substantial sell-off in the last couple of days and is down over 20% in the last month. Panic has hit the crypto world, and a lot of people are already talking about a bear market. However, we can actually look behind the scenes here to try and better understand why Bitcoin is selling off. Furthermore, we can use technical analysis to determine the key levels of support that we might test in the next few days. Ultimately, the fundamentals for Bitcoin have not changed. Data suggests we will see trillions flow into crypto over the next decade. “Die Wale” Are Selling The German government has been selling the Bitcoin it seized over the last few weeks. On.chain data suggests the German government sold around $175 million in Bitcoin on July 4th. And this is just the tip of the iceberg, since the European country still holds a neat stash of around 40,000 Bitcoin. Following the initial price crash, the founder of Tron (TRON-USD), Justin Sun, offered to buy up all of Germany’s Bitcoin off-chain in order to prevent further price crashes. We’ve also seen some German MPs voice their disagreement with the country's actions. Joana Costa said the Bitcoin sales were a hasty move, and that the government should consider holding on to the cryptocurrency in order to diversify the nation's Treasury reserves. On top of the sales from the German government, which are a verifiable fact, there’s also some speculation that investors could be selling their Bitcoin received from the recent Mt.Gox settlement, or that perhaps short-sellers are pre-empting this move. Mt.Gox was one of the first large centralized crypto exchanges, and following its bankruptcy, legal procedures have taken place in order to re-pay their users to the extent possible. The trustee for the Mt.Gox bankruptcy estate said that they had begun paying out settlements in Bitcoin this Friday. That’s about $9 billion worth of Bitcoin that could be entering as possible selling pressure. Fundamentally, there’s been a temporary and sudden spike in selling pressure, without a commensurate increase in demand. It’s certainly worth noting that this sell-off really began taking place on July 4th, a day when regular markets are closed in the US, and one would expect the crypto market to also be less liquid than usual. Technical Outlook Looking at the technicals, however, we are well within the range of a correction I would expect in Bitcoin. Bitcoin weekly chart (Trendspider) Looking at the weekly chart, I’d say we are still forming an impulse from the lows back in 2023. Bitcoin topped around $70,000 in a wave 3 and has now formed a corrective ABC structure in a wave 4. As I write this, we are finding support around the 38.2% retracement, and we are also holding above the50 week MA. The RSI is approaching 50 and the last time this happened on the weekly was just ahead of the wave rally. BTC daily chart (Trendspider) Zooming in, we can see that we have completed an ABC in wave 4, with the plates moving down a pretty clean five-wave structure. It’s definitely quite encouraging to see that while the price has fallen, the RSI has held quite well, giving us a bullish divergence. We did break below the 200 EMA on the daily chart, but we also saw this happen earlier in this bullish cycle. $54,000 could be the bottom, but below that our next main area of support is just around $50,000 where we have the 50% retracement. Below that, we may have to worry about the more immediate future of Bitcoin, though I would still argue it would be an attractive long-term buy. Fundamentals The fundamental landscape for Bitcoin is still very much supportive of higher prices, with three great sources of demand coming in over the next few years to push this higher- Institutions Nations Young(er) Investors The adoption by institutions, including funds and companies, is already well underway. Institutional AUM is over $60 trillion , and we are already seeing a change in the tide. Microstrategy ( MSTR ) is heavily accumulating Bitcoin, and so are other companies like Tesla (TSLA). US companies hold around $6.9 trillion in cash reserves that could potentially make their way into Bitcoin and even other cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, we may see a shift in nations too. Yes, this may still be far away, but the recent sales by Germany have brought this fact to the forefront. There are politicians within the system making the case for Bitcoin. Even Donald Trump, who could potentially be the next US president mentioned using Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. Global currency reserves (Statista) There's currently over $11 trillion in foreign reserves according to this data from Statista . This is yet another source of demand that could slowly make its way into Bitcoin over the next decade. We already have countries like El Salvador, which is using Bitcoin as legal tender and has accumulated large reserves. I don't expect Bitcoin to take a major role in the monetary system, at least not in the next decade, but there's certainly going to be some value to holding at least some Bitcoin. Lastly, it’s also worth noting that we are going to see a huge transfer of wealth from Baby Boomers or Gen X and Millennial investors. AUM by generation (Reddit) Up to $84 trillion will be passed down to younger investors according to Bank of America (BAC). Why does this matter? These younger investors are much more likely to put money into crypto. Investor preferences by age (BofA) Crypto and digital assets come second only to real estate in terms of investor preferences, again, according to BofA research. As these assets transition from the older generation to the younger, we can expect these younger investors to allocate a much larger percentage of their wealth towards digital assets. Final Thoughts In conclusion, I still believe this Bitcoin sell-off is a huge opportunity for investors. Technical levels are still holding on to the larger time-frames, and fundamentals still support Bitcoin’s continued price appreciation thanks to those three sources of demand mentioned above. While Bitcoin's market cap is not going to increase 100-fold from these levels, I do believe there's plenty of room for it to appreciate significantly as it becomes a staple in portfolios around the globe for institutions, companies and the coming generation of retail investors. Bitcoin has gained social acceptance, and it has established itself as a valid form of investment. Today's pullback does not represent the end of the asset's ascent, but merely a small correction in what will likely be a much larger bull market.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702629-this-is-why-bitcoin-is-crashing-and-why-im-buying-more?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/30479749.jpeg

This is significant for the meme coin’s ecosystem, considering the impact these investors usually have on Shiba Inu’s price. Shiba Inu’s Whale Activity Declines By Over 100% Data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock shows that Shiba Inu’s whale activity has declined by over 100% in the last seven days. This is based on the large holders’ netflow metric, which indicates when these whales are adding to their positions or offloading their tokens. Related Reading: Bitcoin Closes CME Gap, Expert Predicts What Happens Next The 100% decline in large holders’ netflow points to these whales opting against accumulating and selling their Shiba Inu tokens instead. The large holders’ outflow metric also points to these whales offloading their tokens, as there has been an 18% increase in the amount of Shiba Inu tokens leaving these whales’ addresses in the last seven days. Meanwhile, in the same period, there has been an almost 23% drop in the large holder inflows, which suggests that more whales are opting against adding their Shiba Inu positions. This is evidently bad for the Shiba Inu ecosystem as significant selling pressure from these whales could further make the meme coin’s price tumble. Other on-chain metrics also paint a bearish outlook for the meme coin. For instance, data from IntoTheBlock shows that the ‘In The Money’ metric is bearish, as 52.46% of Shiba Inu addresses are currently at a loss. This could pile more selling pressure on the meme coin as more investors look to cut their loss, fearing that Shiba Inu could further decline from its current price level. Shiba Inu also risks losing most of the gains it made earlier this year if it fails to hold above its current support level. The In the Money metric shows that most addresses currently invested in Shiba Inu bought the meme coin at its current price range. As such, a decline below this range could send the crypto token on a free fall to levels not seen in a while. Bitcoin Making Matters Worse For Shiba Inu Data from IntoTheBlock shows that Shiba Inu has a strong positive price correlation with Bitcoin. This has also significantly contributed to the downtrend that the meme coin is currently facing. SHIB’s price correlation with Bitcoin seems to be why the second-largest meme coin by market cap has been one of the most affected since the flagship crypto dropped below its crucial support level at $60,000. Related Reading: XRP Stars Align: Indicators Point To Possible 7,500% Rally To $35 Shiba Inu’s price correlation with Bitcoin suggests that things could get worse for the meme coin.

42417776,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZvRt,1720198978,"Sacked Northern Data Execs File Suit Against Tether-Backed Company, Alleging Fraud","Two former executives of Tether-backed German tech company Northern Data have filed suit against the firm, alleging that they were wrongfully terminated after raising concerns about the company’s financial health and alleging tax evasion.  Northern Data is the largest bitcoin miner in Europe. In addition to bitcoin mining, the company also operates data centers used for artificial intelligence.  In their recently unsealed California lawsuit, the two executives – Joshua Porter and Gulsen Kama – allege that Northern Data lied to investors about the strength of its finances, hiding the fact that it is “borderline insolvent,” and, additionally, is “knowingly committing tax evasion to the tune of potentially tens of millions of dollars.”  The allegations come amidst growing media buzz that Northern Data is considering a U.S initial public offering (IPO) of its artificial intelligence unit, which Bloomberg reported was valued at up to $16 billion.  Porter joined the U.S. subsidiary of Northern Data as COO and was later promoted to CEO of the U.S. arm of the company. Only after his promotion, the suit claimed, did Porter get a true look behind the curtain at the reality of the company’s financial situation. According to Porter’s suit, Northern Data had a “$30 [million] German tax liability and additional liabilities of almost $8 [million] while simultaneously having only $17 [million] cash on the balance and a monthly burn rate of $3 [million]-$4 [million].”  Porter also grew increasingly concerned about the company’s potential U.S. tax liabilities. The suit alleges that the firm committed “rampant tax evasion” in its early years and had no plan to take remedial measures to account for it. Porter worried that Northern Data’s U.S. tax liability “could easily be in the tens of millions of dollars” and, if it were to be audited by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), it could wind up insolvent.  Porter took his concerns to his superiors at Northern Data. When his concerns “fell on deaf ears”, as his lawyers described, Porter threatened to escalate matters by going to the company’s board of directors. Shortly after, he said he was fired – a move his superiors strangely blamed on an “internal decision to eliminate the position of North American [COO]” – a position he had not held in months.  Kama, who started out as the CFO of the U.S. subsidiaries before being promoted the group’s CFO, reported similar concerns “regarding accounting and securities fraud” to her superiors at Northern Data – ”to no avail, because the CEO and COO were perpetuating the accounting and securities fraud,” the suit claims. Northern Data’s CEO is Aroosh Thillainathan and its COO is Rosanne Kincaid-Smith.  After repeated attempts to warn the company about the fraud it was allegedly committing, Kama claimed she was sacked in an act of illegal retaliation for her whistleblowing activities.  “Specifically, Kama was terminated for her admonitions that Northern Data was flagrantly violating securities and tax laws and her attempts to ensure Northern Data did not continue to make fraudulent representations in connection with the company’s audit process and to impose audit controls and governance procedures on Northern Data’s most senior management,” the plaintiffs’ lawyers wrote.  Porter and Kama’s suit is seeking compensatory and special damages for their alleged wrongful termination. Though a figure has not yet been named, their lawyers wrote in the complaint that Northern Data’s alleged activity potentially exposes them to “millions of dollars of liability.”  A spokesperson for Northern Data said the firm ""refutes the allegations in the strongest terms, and we are contesting them vigorously to protect ourselves against false assertions which damage our company and our business.  ""Integrity is paramount to Northern Data Group and its leadership,"" the spokesperson added. ""As a publicly listed company we have comprehensive policies and procedures to ensure the accuracy of our financial reporting. Our 2022 accounts received an unqualified audit opinion and we will release our 2023 audited financials shortly.  A spokesperson for Tether declined to comment on ""ongoing legal matters"" but added: ""We reaffirm our commitment to our investors and stakeholders to maintain trust and uphold the principles that guide our operations. We've always operated with the highest standards of integrity and transparency and remain confident in the long-term potential of the company and sector.""

30475020,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=628038,1720198817,XRP Holds Bullish 2014-2017 Pattern Unless This Happens: Analyst,"In a tumultuous day for cryptocurrencies, the price of XRP plummeted to a low of $0.38249 on Bitstamp, reflecting a broader downtrend affecting the altcoin market. With a notable 12.4% decrease in the last 24 hours, XRP is facing crucial support. Despite this substantial decline, Dark Defender (@DefendDark), a noted crypto analyst on X, continues to uphold a bullish outlook on XRP’s future prospects. XRP Price Needs To Hold $0.39 In his analysis of the 1-month XRP/USD chart, Dark Defender notes specific key levels and indicators. He points out that “XRP hit our last support level of $0.3917 after staying under $0.4623 for 3 consecutive candles.” This observation is crucial as it highlights the resilience of XRP at a significant support level—the Point of Control (POC). Related Reading: XRP Stars Align: Indicators Point To Possible 7,500% Rally To $35 The POC, where Dark Defender indicates “Green Dotted Line – the price level where most trades took place since 2014,” stands at $0.3917. This level serves as a focal point for trader consensus on value, historically providing a strong foundation for the price. The recent touch of this level suggests a testing ground where bullish sentiments could potentially stabilize and reverse the downtrend. The chart by Dark Defender also includes Fibonacci retracement levels, which are pivotal in identifying potential support and resistance areas based on previous price movements. According to Dark Defender, the $0.4623 level, corresponding to the 38.20% Fibonacci retracement, poses a significant resistance. Should XRP rise above this threshold, it might pave the way for further gains towards higher Fibonacci levels such as $0.6649 and $1.8815, which correspond to 70.20% and 161.80% retracements, respectively. Dark Defender highlights the Relative Strength Index (RSI), stating, “XRP Daily & weekly RSI are at the bottom and oversold.” This indicates that the asset is potentially undervalued, and such conditions often precede a price recovery. He also compares the current monthly RSI levels to those seen during major market bottoms in March 2020 and November 2022, suggesting a possible repeat of the recovery patterns observed during those periods. Related Reading: 200 Million XRP Tokens On The Move, Where Are They Headed? The volume profile on the chart underscores the presence of substantial trading activity at and around the POC. This high volume at lower prices signals robust buying interest, which could cushion further drops and establish a strong support base. Overall, Dark Defender presents a case for a potential bullish reversal for XRP. His scrutiny of support levels, particularly the resilience at $0.3917, coupled with oversold RSI conditions and a historically significant trading volume at this price, paints a picture of possible upward momentum. As the market digests these levels, the ability to sustain above $0.3917 will be critical in determining its short-term price trajectory, potentially mirroring the recovery phases of 2014-2017. From March till Mai 2017, XRP rallied by more than 6,600% from below $0.006 to $0.40. If history repeats, the XRP price could be set for a massive rally. However, Dark Defender’s closing remark, “The 2014-2017 pattern is still identical unless the $0.3917 is not protected. I will keep you updated,” underscores the pivotal nature of this support level in the ongoing market dynamics. At press time, XRP traded at $0.41042.

42417777,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZvTx,1720193881,Private Equity Giants Are Circling Bitcoin Miners on AI Allure,"Core Scientific's CEO, Adam Sullivan, said that since announcing the CoreWeave AI infrastructure deal, the company has received several approaches from top-tier private equity firms for financing and partnerships.  PE firms are chasing data center business for AI-related computing power and looking at bitcoin miners' existing infrastructure as attractive options.  Sullivan said the miner isn’t focusing on CoreWeave's recent acquisition offer but expects M&A to accelerate in the mining sector in general.  Private equity (PE) firms are finally seeing value in bitcoin {{BTC}} miners, thanks to the rising demand for data centers that can power artificial intelligence-related (AI) machines.  The bitcoin miners' need for enormous amounts of energy isn't a secret - in fact, it's a hotly debated topic. With the rapid rise of the AI sector, the thirst for power by AI-related firms isn't far off either. There are reports of the industry already using as much energy as a small country and could ramp up even more. This surge is creating a problem for the AI industry: investors are pouring money into the sector, but firms don't have immediate access to infrastructure to feed the ever-growing computing needs.  This is where bitcoin miners and their data centers are becoming a lucrative option for investors, said Adam Sullivan, the CEO of one of the largest mining firms, Core Scientific (CORZ), in an exclusive interview with CoinDesk.  ""Private equity is obviously chasing the data center space right now; even private equity firms that haven't necessarily done data centers before are evaluating the space,"" Sullivan said. These PE firms finally see value in bitcoin miners as they can help the AI-related firms house their machines in already-built mining infrastructure or partner with miners to build out data centers faster than building from scratch.  ""One of the biggest constraints [for data centers] right now is finding sites that have over 100 megawatts of power and have the high voltage substation's transformer in place. Those are difficult sites to find, and it just so happens that's been the criteria for locating bitcoin mining sites for the past four years,"" Sullivan said.  Core Scientific recently inked a 12-year, 200 megawatt (MW) deal with cloud computing firm CoreWeave for AI-related computing needs, with options to expand the capacity further.  Sullivan noted that since the news broke about the deal, Core Scientific has received several approaches from tier-one private equity firms offering financing for further AI-related partnerships. In fact, the deal has triggered a re-rating of the bitcoin mining sector as it renewed investors' interest in the sector. JPMorgan even went one step further and said that the deal validates the mining sector’s involvement in high-performance computing (HPC) and may usher in a new age of mergers and acquisitions for the miners.  Read more: Bitcoin Miners With Attractive Power Contracts Are Potential M&A Targets, JPMorgan Says  Post-Halving struggle  One of the main reasons private equity is interested in the mining sector now is the recent bitcoin halving, which cut the bitcoin rewards in half, making it more competitive for the miners. Many miners are struggling to keep their businesses profitable, and some are looking to either sell the company or diversify their revenue sources by repurposing their data centers to host HCP and AI-related computing machines.  “The halving has also caught the attention of private equity firms, which see this event as an opportunity to consolidate smaller firms and fold their existing infrastructure into their own,"" the firm said in a note dated July 2, adding that some mining stocks, including Hut 8 (HUT) and Bitfarms (BITF) have done ""exceptionally well"" since the halving.  However, the amount of capital needed to build or repurpose data center clusters to accommodate AI computing isn't cheap. In such a competitive market, it is becoming prohibitively more expensive for some miners to do so and private equity is now seeing an opportunity to help these miners offer financing and other expertise, Core Scientific’s CEO said.  ""Many of these Bitcoin mining companies are struggling right now to build their bitcoin mining facilities, and these private equity firms are looking at potential returns, looking at ways that they can grab economic value out of some of these potential conversions [from mining to HCP],"" noted Sullivan. In many cases these PE firms can provide a significant amount of assistance to some of the more ""under-qualified"" miners, including bringing in a new partner or introductions to new potential customers, he added.  Another reason PE firms are circling the mining sector now, after ignoring it for several years, is that previously, “value was too volatile for their return profile."" Longer-duration HPC deals, such as the 12-year contract Core Scientific signed, are “much more viable and investable for private equity firms,” Sullivan added.  Existential threat?  The business model for private equity is own-to-sell: buy a business or asset, tweak or completely change the business model and then sell the company to maximize return. Will this mean the end of the bitcoin miners?  The answer is not that simple, according to Sullivan.  First, this would be part of a broader shift for some sections of the mining business. Future halving will continue to make the industry more competitive, pushing for lower-cost mining sites, which will likely see the most interest from HCP and PE firms.  Secondly, not all mining sites used today can be converted into data centers. A number of variables can make some sites unsuitable for HPC conversion, and he added that these will remain mining sites as long as it's economically viable for them to stay in the mining business.  However, before miners can make it to the next halving, they must survive the one that just happened this year. The overcrowded mining space is now feeling pressure from the margin squeeze, resulting in a flurry of acquisitions and renewed deal-making talks among the miners.  In fact, Core Scientific rejected a $5.75 per share takeover offer from CoreWeave the same day it signed the 200MW deal, saying it significantly undervalued the firm. When asked about the deal's status, Sullivan said both companies are now focused on organic growth opportunities. At the same time, Core Scientific is aggressively pursuing new sites and is talking to new potential clients.  Still, unsurprisingly, the CEO of the public mining company said that if a potential suitor is willing to pay what shareholders and the board considered to be full value for the company, the firm will have to consider the offer. Despite the outright rejection of the offer, Sullivan thinks that M&A is just starting in the mining space.  The recent wave of M&A activity also saw a hostile takeover battle between Riot Platforms (RIOT) and Bitfarms, CleanSpark (CLSK) buying GRIID (GRDI) and Hut 8 getting AI-related financing, and this is just the beginning.  ""I think we're still in the early innings of the M&A that's going to occur over the course of the next 12 months,"" said Sullivan.  ""I think many companies are much more incentivized to sell their businesses to other larger companies, given the infrastructure constraints or look to convert more of their facilities to HPC,"" he noted, adding that most of the ""mid-market"" miners are likely to put themselves up for sale.

42417788,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZvdF,1720193741,Crypto Crash Pushes Fear & Greed Index to Lowest Since Bitcoin Traded at $17K in Early 2023,"The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a popular contrarian indicator to buy and sell, but there could be further downside for bitcoin's price, analysts warned.  Seized BTC sales by the German and U.S. governments, and sell pressure from Mt. Gox user refunds create multibillion-dollar overhang, SynFutures' Rachel Lin said.  Bitcoin could sink to $50,000 during historically weak months ahead but a Fed interest rate cut in September could ignite a rally, 10x Research's Markus Thieled said.  Crypto investor sentiment cratered to the most negative levels since the tail-end of the 2022 crypto winter as bitcoin's {{BTC}} plunge below $54,000 pulled down digital asset markets.  The widely-followed Crypto Fear & Greed Index, created by data source Alternative.me, shows market enthusiasm towards bitcoin and other large cryptocurrencies, with 0 being extreme fear and 100 translating to extreme greed.  The gauge dropped to 29 on Friday, its deepest dive into the fear zone since early January 2023 when bitcoin was trading around $17,000 after 2022's crushing bear market.  Read more: Bitcoin Slumps Below $54K as Mt. Gox Moves $2.6B in BTC  The metric notably sent out a contrarian sell signal this past March when it reached the 90 level at near what turned out to be (so far) the 2024 top of the broader crypto market and bitcoin's all-time high of about $73,500. Since then, BTC and ether {{ETH}} are 25%-30% lower, while altcoin majors plunged around 50% and smaller tokens lost even more.  Is the bottom in?  Extreme levels of fear may present buying opportunities, but the reality is more nuanced with several factors to be considered.  The key catalysts behind the downturn was the unloading of seized bitcoin by German and U.S. governments, along with ""preemptively selling"" as the estate of defunct Japanese exchange Mt. Gox started to refund investors this month, Rachel Lin, CEO and co-founder of derivatives trading venue SynFutures, said in a market update.  The selling pressure is unlikely to abate in the short-term, she said. The German government still holds some $2.2 billion worth of BTC, the U.S. government has over $12 billion and the Mt. Gox estate has more than $8 billion of assets, data by blockchain tracing platform Arkham Intelligence shows.  Read more: Mt. Gox Begins Repayments in Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash  ""The direction of bitcoin in the coming days will be determined by the selling pressure from Mt. Gox users,"" Lin added.  ""The market expects most Mt. Gox users dump their tokens, but we might see a bounce back if the selling is lower than anticipated, she said. ""On the other hand, if there is enough selling to push the price lower, we might be looking at the $50,000 level soon.""  Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research trimmed his $55,000 price target to $50,000. ""This situation may compel ETF holders and miners to liquidate more positions,"" he said in an emailed note, adding that August and September are historically ""challenging months"" for bitcoin.

Investors feel chilly from this large fund movement, which begs the question of where the price of the currency will go in the future. Related Reading: Worldcoin Sentiment Improves, But March Highs Remain A Distant Dream Whales Making Waves The transfers, identified by blockchain tracker Whale Alert, originated from unknown wallets and landed at Coinbase, a major exchange platform. This large-scale movement suggests potential selling by major SOL holders, often referred to as “whales.” Whales, due to the sheer volume of crypto they possess, can significantly impact market prices. Their actions can trigger buying frenzies or selling cascades, leaving smaller investors scrambling to adjust. 🚨 🚨 322,817 #SOL (45,501,762 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to #Coinbasehttps://t.co/FnKjw1aAfG — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) July 3, 2024 The timing of these transfers couldn’t be worse. The broader cryptocurrency market is already battling a fierce downturn, with Bitcoin (BTC) leading the plunge. Solana hasn’t been spared the carnage, experiencing a 6% price drop in the last 24 hours. The sudden influx of SOL onto Coinbase adds fuel to the fire of bearish sentiment surrounding the coin. 🚨 🚨 318,664 #SOL (44,916,411 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to #Coinbasehttps://t.co/sqxxGvED2D — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) July 3, 2024 These large, coordinated movements are like tremors felt throughout the crypto market. Whales, with their massive holdings, can trigger significant price swings. The recent SOL exodus has investors on edge, worried it could be the spark that ignites a fire sale, further deepening the current slump. 🚨 🚨 317,314 #SOL (44,726,070 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to #Coinbasehttps://t.co/gcWjOrpoS2 — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) July 3, 2024 Fear Grips The Market Meanwhile, technical indicators paint a grim picture for SOL in the short term. The Fear & Greed Index, a measure of investor sentiment, currently sits at a lowly 29, firmly in “Fear” territory. Solana price predictions are a mixed bag, with CoinCodex offering a glimmer of hope with a forecasted 16% rise by August 4th. However, the recent market volatility throws a wrench into any such predictions. Is this a quiet pause before a price surge, or are investors abandoning Solana altogether? The coming days will be critical as we see how these whale movements affect the price of SOL and the entire crypto market. Caution is advised for investors, who should keep a close eye on how the market reacts. While some analysts fear a fire sale by whales, others believe this could be a strategic repositioning within the crypto ecosystem. Perhaps the whales are simply moving their holdings to different exchanges or platforms in anticipation of future developments.

The investment manager plans to financially support four Republican candidates – Sam Brown in Nevada, David McCormick in Pennsylvania, Bernie Moreno in Ohio and Tim Sheehy in Montana – through donations to the conservative super political action committee (PAC) Sentinel Action Fund.  How much Multicoin gives depends on the outcome of Sentinel's crypto donation drive. According to the group's website, Multicoin will match 100% of {{SOL}} token donations sent to Sentinel by July 14. Gemini is hosting the group's crypto donations portal and appears to be accepting a variety of tokens, including SOL.  ""We’re doing this because we realize that political engagement matters, and it starts with supporting the candidates who believe America needs to remain free for innovation,"" said Multicoin Managing Partner Kyle Samani in a statement.  Multicoin – as well as its leaders Samani and Tushar Jain – have previously supported pro-crypto candidates on a bipartisan basis. That isn't changing with the donation to Sentinel, despite its status as a decidedly conservative group, a person familiar with the firm's thinking said.  That said, Multicoin identified Sentinel as being aligned with its crypto interests by way of the specific candidates it is backing this cycle, the person said. These four republicans Sentinel is supporting all receive ""A"" ratings from the Coinbase-led crypto advocacy group Stand With Crypto.  These candidates' opponents aren't uniformly critical of cryptocurrency on the level of Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator despised by the crypto industry for her rhetoric of hosting an ""anti-crypto army."" Three of the four are rated as ""neutral"" or better by Stand With Crypto, though Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown touts an ""F.""  Still, Multicoin's decision-makers are eager to invest in races that could flip the Senate to Republican control, the person said. Doing so would shift the balance of power in agency appointments and other key areas where crypto companies intersect with the federal government, such as the courts.

This time, on-chain data shows a dormant Bitcoin wallet that transferred over $6.8 million in Bitcoin, suggesting that this whale may also be looking to sell their tokens. Dormant Bitcoin Wallet Transfers Funds For First Time In 12 Years On-chain data shows that a Bitcoin wallet (1Nxxi) that had been dormant for 12 years transferred funds for the first time on July 4. The wallet contained $6.8 million worth of Bitcoin, with all these funds moved in two separate transactions. 76 BTC ($4.46 million) was initially sent from the wallet to an unknown address (3Ctd5), and 43 BTC ($2.46 million) was sent in the second transaction to the same unknown address. Related Reading: XRP Stars Align: Indicators Point To Possible 7,500% Rally To $35 The last outflow from this address came in 2012 when 2.98 BTC was sent to an unknown address. These recent transactions have raised concerns for the crypto community because they suggest that the whale in question may be looking to offload its holdings. They also come at a time when Bitcoin is facing significant selling pressure. As such, a sale of such magnitude could compound Bitcoin’s problems and lead to further declines for the flagship crypto. However, on-chain data shows that the 119 BTC that was transferred is still intact in the unknown address (3Ctd5) to which it was sent. This is undoubtedly a relief for the crypto community since these tokens would have long been sent to an exchange if this whale was looking to offload their holdings. In the meantime, Bitcoin is still facing intense selling pressure from other entities, including the German government. On-chain analytics platform Arkham Intelligence revealed that the German government is selling up to $175 million worth of Bitcoin. In the last 24 hours, they have moved 1,300 BTC ($76 million) to Kraken, Bitstamp, and Coinbase. They also transferred 1,700 BTC ($99 million) to an unknown address (139Po). Arkham claimed that the funds to this unknown address are likely deposits for an institutional service or OTC. Mt. Gox Begins Repayments To Creditors Defunct crypto exchange Mt. Gox recently announced that it has begun repayments to its creditors.

The company's balance sheet remains very liquid with over 9,000 BTC holdings, reducing the need for debt and potential dilution. HUT's AI vertical business could start generating revenue in the second half of the year, potentially leading to further stock price decoupling from Bitcoin. HUT 8 Mining Corp. ( HUT ) has been one of the mining companies on my radar since the start of this Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) market cycle. In my coverage of the stock about ten months ago, I recommended a “hold” - at a time when I gave peers like Marathon Digital ( MARA ) and Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) a “sell” rating. The growing Bitcoin miner appealed to me then because of its strong cash position (strengthened by its BTC holding) and the planned merger with USBTC at that time, though the company faced several downtime issues in that period. My following coverage of HUT 8 was a little over six months ago (in January). In that article, which I titled HUT 8: Diversified Business Appeal , I highlighted how HUT’s growing high-performance computing (HPC) business makes the company an attractive Bitcoin miner. I also talked about the miner’s low price-to-hash ratio compared to peers, and the more moderate price action the stock had seen compared to peers who had recorded triple-digit percentage gains. The stock is up about 67% on that “buy” rating. Considering the YTD gain and the current stock price, is there room for more upside for HUT? HUT’s Financial and Operations Turnaround Since Asher Genoot became CEO of HUT, there has been some turnaround in the company’s operations. In the CEO’s own words: “We have centered Hut 8 on operating excellence and bottom-line economics.” Part of the necessary steps for the company has been the sunsetting of inefficient facilities and products. HUT’s facility at Drumheller was shut down in Q1 for being inefficient. In articles, I wrote last month covering CleanSpark ( CLSK ) and Marathon Digital, I talked about how critical it is for a miner to directly own and control key aspects of its operations at this stage of the Bitcoin market cycle. Since the fourth halving event, a miner’s direct control over such key variables has been one of the most important qualitative factors I look for before considering adding a miner stock to my portfolio. MARA now directly owns and controls 54% of its electricity as opposed to just 3% previously, and runs mostly proprietary software and hardware. Bitdeer ( BTDR ) is moving towards incorporating proprietary hardware and software in its operations. Miners who still rely heavily on third-party providers for resources like electricity and facilities could easily lag in operational efficiency. HUT 8 has moved away from running most of its miners at hosted facilities and now operates its own facilities. Fleets from hosted facilities have been relocated to HUT’s own facilities. HUT is also implementing proprietary software that will monitor its energy usage and help the miner attain efficient energy usage. Moving to its own site has lowered HUT’s cost to mine BTC due to its lower all-in energy cost of less than $275,000 per megawatt for 63 megawatts of new capacity the miner brought online in Q1. Cost to mine at HUT’s own facilities is expected to eventually become 30% lower compared to when the company mainly used hosted facilities. The miner is in the process of developing 1,100 MW of electricity and has ample dry powder to achieve this. HUT’s balance sheet remains very liquid. Its 9,102 BTC holding at the end of Q1 resulted in a $276.4 million net income, due to a valuation of its BTC holdings to fair value based on the FASB fair value accounting rule which Bitcoin miners have adopted. Net assets (total assets minus total liabilities) are about three times greater than total liabilities. Total assets are about $1 billion and total liabilities are $258 million. Note that HUT’s Q1 balance sheet includes assets from its acquisition of four power plants from entities controlled by Validus Power Corp., earlier this year. What makes HUT's balance sheet more attractive and highly liquid is that its 9,102 BTC holdings, marked at a fair value of around $650 million, make up over 50% of its total assets. The bottom line is that at the moment HUT can comfortably cover its debt obligation, invest in growth opportunities, and have much less need to take on debt with unfavorable conditions. Bottom Line I like the fact that HUT is focusing on electricity capacity expansion to enhance its self-mining. One of the drawbacks HUT has faced in the past has been power surges at some of its facilities, resulting in operational inefficiencies. Challenges with mining operations are about to be a thing of the past for HUT. All indicators suggest that HUT’s AI vertical business could commence generating sales soon. HUT has hinted at the high possibility of generating revenue from its AI vertical business in the second half of this year. According to HUT’s June operations update , 512 Nvidia H100 GPUs were installed and configured at an HPC data center in June as part of outfitting the data centers to accommodate the new AI infrastructure. One of the perks of holding HUT in a Bitcoin stock portfolio is its much lesser risk of dilution compared to some of its mining peers. I don't see any need for HUT to raise funds through equity in the foreseeable future. It's over 9,000 BTC stash, the recent $150 million Coatue funding to boost its HPC line for its AI vertical business, and its restated $65 million credit facility from Coinbase provide all the dry powder the company would be needing. It is worth mentioning that while HUT doesn't face risk of immediate dilution, there is risk of dilution at some point in the future. The $150 million Coatue funding, for example, was secured through convertible notes. HUT Golden Cross (barchart.com) From a technical standpoint, HUT’s MA50 crossed MA200, forming a Golden Cross last week. The last Golden Cross last year sent the stock soaring 120% in a 60-day period. There is potential for HUT forming a strong uptrend channel and see a similar uptrend after the recent Golden Cross if the current Bitcoin sell-off FUD doesn't impede Bitcoin’s momentum for too long. HUT vs BTC price movement 3Y (Seeking Alpha) As seen in the chart above, HUT has majorly mirrored Bitcoin price movements; though there has been some decoupling between HUT and BTC since Q3 last year, HUT remains mainly regarded as a Bitcoin stock and is not immune from the effects of Bitcoin’s volatility. However, I believe that HUT is one of the Bitcoin stocks that could see a further price decoupling from Bitcoin soon, when the AI vertical business takes full shape and revenue from that segment begins to contribute a significant share to total revenue. Though the stock is up over 60% since the last “buy” rating in January, I see more upside potential for HUT based on simple, clear technical indicators and strong qualitative factors.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702565-hut-8-ample-dry-powder-for-bitcoin-mining-and-ai-vertical-expansion?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/30466911.jpeg

Bitwise Bitcoin ETF offers low-cost exposure to Bitcoin, but technical bear market territory raises concerns for further downside. Seasonal trends and technical analysis suggest potential support levels at $51,000 and $48,000 to $49,100. I outline key technical risks and why Bitcoin has fallen so hard lately. The price of Bitcoin (BTC-USD) plunged during light holiday trading shortly after the Fourth of July. The move didn’t come out of nowhere, though, as the cryptocurrency was already experiencing selling pressure off its most recent peak above $70,000 in early June. Before the close of the holiday-shortened week on Wall Street, the price of one Bitcoin had dipped under $55,000 – a more than 20% pullback in less than a month’s time. Investors are left wondering if now is the time to add to a position or wait for a more favorable entry point. I assert that some patience is needed, but we are nearing critical support. I have a hold rating on shares of the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB). It’s among the smaller spot Bitcoin ETFs, but it has respectable size and is a good proxy for Bitcoin in my view. Why has Bitcoin pulled back so hard from a fundamental perspective? We can perhaps pin the decline on Mt. Gox, a once-prominent Tokyo-based Bitcoin exchange that is now preparing to reimburse creditors after its 2014 bankruptcy with approximately $9 billion worth of Bitcoin. On July 5, 47,000 Bitcoin were moved to another wallet from Mt. Gox. It was Bitcoin’s fourth straight session of losses. Bitcoin Plunges Into Early July, Bear Market Territory TradingView Bitcoin and Stocks Losing Correlation Bloomberg According to the issuer , BITB allows investors to gain convenient, low-cost exposure to bitcoin through a professionally managed ETF. This may avoid the cost, complexity, and custody concerns of owning Bitcoin directly. Bitcoin has distinct return patterns and historically low correlations to traditional stocks and bonds. As a result, bitcoin can offer long-term diversification and risk management benefits to an overall investment portfolio. BITB is a moderate-sized ETF with $2.3 billion in assets under management as of July 3, 2024. Its low 0.20% annual expense ratio puts it close to the cost of comparable spot Bitcoin funds, but its share-price momentum has weakened considerably in the past month, now hitting technical bear-market territory. BITB is a highly liquid product given its average daily trading volume of nearly two million shares, while its median 30-day bid/ask spread is narrow at just three basis points, per Bitwise. What’s troubling right now for the Bitcoin bulls is that for the first time since last October, the world’s largest cryptocurrency is now under its 200-day moving average. As Grant Hawkridge pointed out this morning, Bitcoin's historical forward returns are not all that rosy when the price falls below the key long-term moving average. This has me concerned about further downside. Bitcoin: Poor Returns Following A Cross Under the 200dma Grant Hawkridge Making the weak price action even more worrisome is that it comes as the Bloomberg United States Financial Conditions Index has turned exceptionally loose. Normally, you would expect risky and speculative assets, such as Bitcoin, to perform well amid such lax conditions. That’s not what we are seeing right now. This is a possible tell that if financial markets turn more volatile, then something like Bitcoin could endure even more losses. Loose Financial Conditions Kevin Gordon, Schwab Another negative factor? Seasonality. This chart is from Jeffrey Hirsch , and it illustrates that the June through early October period has historically been the worst calendar stretch for Bitcoin in its more than a decade-long trading history. If we were to follow seasonal trends, then a cautious approach would be prudent during the third quarter. But where is a good place to begin accumulating or adding to an existing Bitcoin position? Let’s inspect the chart. Bitcoin: Bearish Seasonal Stretch Through Early October Jeffrey Hirsch The Technical Take I will begin by assessing Bitcoin’s chart, and will then translate that into price points on BITB. Notice in the graph below that shares are under the rising long-term 200-day moving average. If price can reclaim that trend indicator line, then much of the bearish sentiment could get wiped away. But if it remains under the 200dma, we have to find potential areas of interest lower from today’s $55,000 level. I see two spots. The first is the 38.2% retracement of the rally from $15,480 in November 2022 to the peak of $73,800 in March 2024. That comes into play near $51,000. I would expect some technical support there. The second area of interest is the $48,000 to $49,100 range – that was resistance in early 2022 and again at the beginning of this year. What’s more, the cryptocurrency consolidated there before surging to a new all-time high back in February. It’s a natural polarity area, so buying there, with a stop depending on your risk tolerance, would make sense. On the upside, there is now a large amount of volume by price, or bearish congestion, in the $58,000 to $73,000 zone, which will make conditions tough on the bulls. Bitcoin: $51k and $49k May Offer Support, But BTC-USD is Below the 200dma Stockcharts.com Translating that into price spots on BITB, be on the lookout for support at $28 and $27, respectively. BITB: Support at $28 and $27 Stockcharts.com The Bottom Line I have a hold rating on Bitwise Bitcoin ETF. With higher volatility today and key support about 10% under the latest Bitcoin price, prudence is encouraged to buy the ETF at a more favorable risk/reward price.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702563-finding-bitcoin-support-eyeing-bitb-amid-poor-seasonal-trends?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/30466600.jpeg

The unemployment rate in June rose to 4.1% versus 4.0% in May and forecasts for 4.0%.  Average hourly earnings rose by 0.3% compared with forecasts for 0.3% and May's 0.4%. Looking at the metric on a year-over-year basis, it was higher by 3.9% versus expectations for 3.9% and the previous month's 4.1% reading.  The price of bitcoin {{BTC}} dipped a hair to $55,300 in the minutes following the news, but the drop is negligible given the roughly 10% crash over the past 48 hours as markets dealt with the crush of supply coming from Mt. Gox repayments and German government sales.  Ahead of this morning's data, traders were putting nearly zero chance of a U.S. Federal Reserve rate cut at the bank's July 31 meeting, but more than a 70% chance of lower rates at the mid-September meeting, according to the CME FedWatch tool. Speaking this week, Fed Chair Jerome Powell leaned somewhat dovish as he suggested a weaker job market might trump concern over inflation as the central bank decides on the path forward for monetary policy.  While the headline 206,000 jobs added topped forecasts, other data suggests some weakness. May's job gain was revised down to 218,000 from 272,000. In addition April's originally reported job gain of 165,000 was revised down to 108,000. Taking the three months together shows an average job gain of 177,000 versus 249,000 for the prior quarter.  In addition, while the unemployment rate rose just modestly, the 4.1% reading is the highest level since November 2021.

The meme-based cryptocurrency took a significant hit this Thursday, dropping 14% in value in the last 24 hours. Related Reading: Worldcoin Sentiment Improves, But March Highs Remain A Distant Dream Long Positions Liquidated According to Coinglass, a crypto derivatives data platform, DOGE saw a whopping $4.8 million in long positions liquidated. This signifies that investors who bet on DOGE’s price increase got squeezed as the price went down. Conversely, short positions (bets on a price decrease) saw minimal liquidations at just $56,680. This liquidation event coincides with a major price drop for DOGE, pushing it to a three-month low. The price currently sits between $0.099 and $0.117, a crucial support zone identified by IntoTheBlock, a blockchain analytics firm. This zone represents a large number of wallets holding DOGE, and if it holds, the price could potentially rebound towards $0.142.

LIQUIDATION DATA IN 24 HOURS TOTAL LIQUIDATIONS: UP TO $321.28M TOP 5 COINS WITH HIGHEST LIQUIDATION:$BTC ~ $91.51M $ETH ~ $71.90M$SOL ~ $12.84M $DOGE ~ $5.39M $WLD ~ $5.23M #Blockchain #DeFi #liquidation pic.twitter.com/e6Dv5uQbkn — PHOENIX – Crypto News & Analytics (@pnxgrp) July 4, 2024 Interestingly, DOGE takes the fourth spot for most significant liquidations, surpassing bigger players like Solana (SOL). Even younger meme coins like Dogwifhat (WIF) and Pepe (PEPE) haven’t been spared, experiencing significant liquidations as well. Dogecoin, despite its recent struggles, remains a significant player in the crypto market. It operates on the Litecoin blockchain, a well-established technology, and boasts of over $13 billion market capitalization. A Double-Edged Sword: No Spot Market Pressure, But High Bitcoin Correlation There’s a silver lining for DOGE. Unlike the derivatives market, the spot market (where actual buying and selling of crypto happens) doesn’t seem to be experiencing significant selling pressure. Data shows that DOGE buy orders are actually outpacing sell orders by nearly $1 million.

They share a very high price correlation, meaning even minor sell-offs in Bitcoin can significantly impact DOGE’s price. Recent events like potential sell-offs from Mt. Gox, a defunct crypto exchange, and the German government selling confiscated Bitcoin, could indirectly affect DOGE’s price. Will DOGE Rebound? Meanwhile, Dogecoin’s technical indicators are leaning bearish. The price prediction of a 13% drop by August 4th aligns with the current sentiment. The Fear and Greed Index at 29 further reinforces this bearish outlook. Additionally, despite having a third of the last 30 days in positive territory, Dogecoin still experienced significant price volatility, which could indicate a continuation of the downtrend.

30463844,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702552-marathon-digital-the-top-miner-for-efficiency-growth-and-bitcoins-next-rally?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,1720182600,"Marathon Digital: The Top Miner For Efficiency, Growth, And Bitcoin's Next Rally","Summary Marathon’s mining efficiency in terms of its revenues per exahash is better than its main competitors, Riot and CleanSpark. Record low hashprices could decrease mining difficulty by 5%, which could help Marathon increase its Bitcoin production. Marathon’s new venture in mining Kaspa could generate more than $87 million in revenues at high margins up to 95%. Marathon’s and Bitcoin’s price movement could signal a strong rally in the near term. I’m reiterating my buy rating for Marathon. The month of June hasn’t been kind to Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) as the world’s largest cryptocurrency is down nearly 16% since the beginning of June, dropping below the $59 thousand mark in the process. Despite that, the largest public Bitcoin miner Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc. ( MARA ) has remained steady over the same period with its stock up 2% since the beginning of June. Earlier this week, Marathon, as well as its competitors Riot ( RIOT ) and CleanSpark ( CLSK ), released their June Bitcoin production updates. All of those companies have seen their production decline YoY due to the halving event that occurred last April. However, Marathon’s update had some promising updates as it mined the most Bitcoin among its peers, increased its industry leading HODL stash, and had the best mining efficiency in terms of its revenues per exahash. In my previous coverages on Marathon titled “ Marathon Digital: The Bitcoin Miner To Own Before Halving And Elections ” and “ Marathon Digital: A Potential Key Cog In Post Halving Bitcoin Mining ”, I was bullish on the stock due to its high exposure to Bitcoin price in light of its HODL stash and its efforts to diversify its business model by selling its technology to other Bitcoin miners. My bullish thesis remains in place as Marathon continued its diversification efforts by venturing into mining Kaspa ( KAS-USD ). I believe this new venture could have substantial benefits to Marathon’s future financial performance due to the high margins associated with mining Kaspa. Meanwhile, the current divergence in the price action of both Marathon and Bitcoin could signal a significant run in the near term. Such a run in both Bitcoin and Marathon could be fueled by the upcoming presidential elections, as I shared in my first coverage on Marathon, as well as a potential decline in mining difficulty due to hashprices being at an all-time low. As such, I’m reiterating my buy rating for Marathon. Improving Mining Efficiency Last June, Marathon mined 590 Bitcoin at a production rate of 19.7 BTC/day. In comparison, Riot mined 255 Bitcoin at a rate of 8.5 BTC/day and CleanSpark mined 445 Bitcoin at a rate of 14.8 BTC/day. On a YoY basis, Marathon’s production declined 40%, Riot’s production declined 45%, while CleanSpark’s production only declined by 9%. Company Mined BTC June 2024 Mined BTC June 2023 Change MARA 590 979 -40% RIOT 255 460 -45% CLSK 445 491 -9% At first glance, the halving event’s impact on CleanSpark appears to be minimal compared to Marathon and Riot. However, the minimal 9% decline in CleanSpark’s production is mainly attributed to its hashrate’s exponential growth from June 2023. Compared to June 2023 levels, Marathon’s operational hashrate increased 102% from 13 EH/s to 26.3 EH/s, Riot’s operational hashrate increased 90% from 6 EH/s to 11.4 EH/s, while CleanSpark’s operational hashrate increased a whooping 204% from 6.7 EH/s to 20.4 EH/s. Company Operational Hash Rate June 2024 Operational Hash Rate June 2023 Change MARA 26.3 13.0 102% RIOT 11.4 6.0 90% CLSK 20.4 6.7 204% At the end of June, Marathon held 18,536 Bitcoin, Riot held 9,334 Bitcoin, and CleanSpark held 6,591 Bitcoin. At the same time, Marathon had a cash balance of $268 million at the end of June, while Riot and CleanSpark had cash balances of $688.5 million and $323 million , respectively, as of March 31st. Accordingly, each company’s cash balance in addition to their respective Bitcoin stashes have the following values at 1 BTC = $58,889.71. MARA RIOT CLSK BTC Held 18,536 9,334 6,591 BTC Value $1,091,579,665 $549,676,553 $388,142,079 Cash $268,000,000 $688,497,000 $323,052,000 HODL+Cash $1,359,579,665 $1,238,173,553 $711,194,079 What caught my attention in Marathon’s monthly update was its mining efficiency in terms of its revenue/EH rate. In June, Bitcoin had an average price of $65,899, a slight increase from $65,266 in May. Accordingly, Marathon’s revenues in June could be around $38.9 million compared to Riot’s $16.8 million and CleanSpark’s $29.3 million. In this way, Marathon, Riot, and CleanSpark, generated $1.48 million, 1.47 million, and $1.44 million respectively per each operational hashrate as the following table shows. MARA RIOT CLSK Revenue $38,880,685 $16,804,364 $29,325,263 Operational Hash Rate 26.3 11.4 20.4 Rev/EH $1,478,353 $1,474,067 $1,437,513 In my opinion, Marathon’s better mining efficiency compared to its peers is especially promising due to the record low hashprice of $0.04 per TH/s that has led Bitcoin’s average hashrate to decline over the past few weeks. As a result, small, unprofitable miners have unplugged from the Bitcoin network, paving the way for large, efficient miners to grow their production with less competition in the network. Based on this, it is expected that mining difficulty could decrease by 5% this week, which could boost hashprice in the coming weeks. Hashrate Index Diversification Efforts On June 26th, Marathon announced a new venture to further diversify its business model after making its technology available for other Bitcoin miners. The company announced that it is mining Kaspa, the fifth largest proof-of-work digital asset with a market cap of $4.14 billion, as of July 4th. Marathon has already purchased 60 petahashes of miners to mine Kaspa, and these miners can generate margins of up to 95% based on Kaspa’s network difficulty rate and price. Currently, the company has 30 petahashes deployed and plans to deploy the remaining petahashes in Q3 2024. As of June 25th, Marathon had mined 93 million Kaspa valued at $15 million, implying an average price of $0.1613. In my opinion, this new venture will boost Marathon’s topline as well as its bottom line due to the high margins of mining Kaspa. According to Minerstat , Marathon could mine around 1,441,635 Kaspa per day once all 60 petahashes are deployed, compared to 720,834 at the current 30 petahashes. Given that Marathon anticipates the full deployment of all 60 petahashes in Q3, I expect it to mine around 99,473,587 Kaspa during the quarter. My forecast is based on 92 days in Q3 and a 30 PH/s run rate for half of the quarter and 60 PH/s for the other half of the quarter. Q3 Production Half at 30 PH 33,158,368 Half at 60 PH 66,315,220 Total Q3 Prod 99,473,587 At Kaspa’s current price of $0.1661, Marathon could generate revenues of $16.5 million in Q3 from mining Kaspa. Meanwhile, the company could generate $22 million in Q4 from mining 132,630,439 Kaspa at 92 days in the quarter and Kaspa’s current price. Assuming that Q1 generally has 90 days, Q2 has 91 days, and Q3 and Q4 have 92 days, Marathon’s 60 PH/s run rate could see it mine 526,196,852 Kaspa next year at the current mining difficulty. KAS Production/Day 1,441,635 KAS Q1 Production 129,747,169 KAS Q2 Production 131,188,804 KAS Q3 Production 132,630,439 KAS Q4 Production 132,630,439 KAS Prod/Year 526,196,852 Therefore, at Kaspa’s current price, Marathon could generate $87.4 million in revenues from this endeavor alone. KAS Rev/Day $239,428 Kas Q1 Rev $11,677,245,201 Kas Q2 Rev $11,938,181,174 Kas Q3 Rev $12,202,000,417 Kas Q4 Rev $12,202,000,417 KAS Annual Rev $87,391,299 It should be noted that these figures differ from actual results depending on Kaspa’s price movement. Bitcoin Price Movement In addition to the fundamentals, looking at Marathon’s and Bitcoin’s respective charts, it appears that both the stock and Bitcoin could witness a strong upward movement in the coming weeks. First thing to look at in both charts is that whenever Bitcoin formed lower highs and lower lows, while Marathon maintained its trend, a strong rally in both Bitcoin and Marathon’s stock occurred as shown in the following charts. TrendSpider Note that Bitcoin is currently forming lower highs and lower lows on the daily timeframe, while Marathon is maintaining its neutral trend. TrendSpider The same can be seen in 2021 when Bitcoin was moving in a downward trend while Marathon maintained its trend. In the following weeks, both Bitcoin and Marathon’s stock climbed 113% and 230%, respectively, from their levels when Bitcoin broke its downward trend. TrendSpider The same happened again in mid-2023 when Bitcoin formed lower highs and lower lows, while Marathon maintained its sideway channel. In the following weeks, Bitcoin and Marathon’s stock climbed 21% and 90% respectively from their levels when Bitcoin broke its downward trend. TrendSpider A potential Bitcoin rally could be supported by the TrendSpider chart above showing the correlation between Bitcoin’s price action and the crypto fear and greed index. The green circles on the chart above highlight that whenever the fear and greed index tests the neutral zone, Bitcoin rallies, which is the case at the moment. TrendSpider Meanwhile, the chart above shows that Marathon has successfully broken out of a symmetrical triangle pattern with a retest of the trendline. This could be a sign of a strong upward movement in the near term. Risks The main risk to my thesis is Bitcoin’s price action. While the technicals and the expectations of lower mining difficulty due to the record low hashprices might signal an upward movement in the cryptocurrency’s price in the coming weeks, Bitcoin could continue its downward trend, especially if June’s non-farm payroll data, scheduled for July 5th , are negative as this could decrease the chances of the Fed cutting interest rates this year. Moreover, Marathon’s venture into mining Kaspa may not provide the forecasted results if the cryptocurrency performs poorly. Conclusion In summary, I remain bullish on Marathon following its June Bitcoin production update that highlighted its efficiency in terms of its revenues/EH, which was better than its largest competitors Riot and CleanSpark. This could be a promising sign for Marathon’s future financial performance thanks to the expectations of mining difficulty declining by 5% in light of the record low hashprices that has driven out inefficient miners. Marathon’s new venture into mining Kaspa to diversify its digital assets could also lead to high returns thanks as it could generate around $87.4 million in annual revenues at extremely high margins of up to 95%. Meanwhile, the divergence between Marathon and Bitcoin’s price movements could signal a strong rally for both Bitcoin and Marathon’s stock, considering the historical data. Such a potential run is further supported by Bitcoin’s price action relative to the fear and greed index, as well as Marathon breaking out of its symmetrical triangle chart pattern. In light of these factors, I’m reiterating my buy rating for Marathon.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702552-marathon-digital-the-top-miner-for-efficiency-growth-and-bitcoins-next-rally?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/30463844.jpeg

Gox Flags Repayments,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin slumped to the lowest since the end of February as Mt. Gox moved a sizeable amount of BTC to a new wallet, potentially preparing for creditor payments. BTC fell to as low as $53,6000 but has subsequently rebounded to just over $55,000, a drop of 4.75% in the last 24 hours. The broader digital asset market, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), slid around 6.85%. Impending Mt. Gox repayments include 140,000 BTC ($7.3 billion). There have been concerns that creditors will sell their coins immediately on receipt, creating mass selling pressure in the market.  Major altcoins suffered heavy losses as part of the slump, with ether and dogecoin among the worst affected. ETH has dropped 7.5% while DOGE is down almost 11%. Data from Coinalyze shows that over $580 million worth of bullish bets were liquidated. The largest single liquidation order was on Binance – an ETH trade valued at $18.4 million. Meanwhile, open interest – or the number of unsettled futures bets – dropped 12%, indicating money was leaving the market. Liquidations occur when an exchange forcibly closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. It happens when a trader cannot meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position.  Only five mining rigs were profitable for their operators as bitcoin slumped to $54,000 this week, creating a scenario that could mark a “local bottom."" ""At a rate of $0.08/kWh, ASICs less efficient than 23 W/T operate at a loss,"" mining giant F2Pool said Friday. A kWh, or kilowatt-hour, measures the energy usage of an electrical device or load. F2Pool’s graph shows four of Antminer’s various rigs and one Avalon rig that are profitable as long as prices are above $53,100. All other miners now cost more to run than the rewards received by operators.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs' flows since they commenced trading in January with the BTC price overlaid on top.  The initial run of almost constant inflows up until early March coincided with continuous surges in bitcoin's price.  Since then, however, ETF flows have had markedly less significant effect.

The proto-danksharding upgrade reduced transaction fees for layer 2 transactions, leading to Ethereum's recent supply inflation. Lower transaction fees post-Dencun upgrade have been a net positive for Ethereum users, increasing demand for Ethereum transactions. Thesis I view Ethereum's (ETH-USD) recent switch from a deflationary supply to an inflationary supply as a neutral development for investors. While inflation will dilute investors over time, it also allows for lower transaction fees. This will lead to increased usage of Ethereum, which could lead to more demand and higher Ethereum prices. I remain bullish on Ethereum in the long term. Ethereum's Changing Supply ycharts The above chart showing Ethereum's supply over the past year appears quite volatile at first glance. There have been periods of inflation, deflation, and relative stability. However, since April, the supply has been steadily inflating. Fortunately, zooming out to a 5-year chart shows that the supply has actually been quite stable since Ethereum's switch to proof of stake in late 2022. The recent bout of inflation barely registers on a chart that includes pre-2022 data: ycharts While the current inflation rate may be small, it's still worth discussing because it had a clear cause that wasn't just temporary volatility. Specifically, the Dencun upgrade went live in March 2024 . This ""hard fork"" upgrade released nine different improvements. One of these improvements - proto-danksharding - is responsible for the recent supply inflation. Proto-Danksharding & Transaction Fees Proto-danksharding reduces fees for ""layer 2"" transactions that are bundled together before being added to the Ethereum blockchain. This is because it allows some data associated with a transaction to be deleted after about 18 days instead of being stored permanently on the Ethereum blockchain. Specifically, some data which is needed to initially validate and process a transaction doesn't need to be stored permanently. This data is redundant with more space-efficient data (such as validator attestations) that's available once the transaction is finalized. In other words, proto-danksharding is simply a means of allowing Ethereum users to temporarily sync some important data without storing it permanently on the blockchain. Like other cryptocurrencies, Ethereum transactions have variable fees that are higher for transactions which require more permanent space on the blockchain. By reducing the amount of permanent storage each layer 2 transaction uses, proto-danksharding has lowered transaction fees for layer 2 Ethereum transactions. Ethereum's Supply Rules Those who are unfamiliar with Ethereum's supply rules may not immediately see the connection between transaction fees falling and Ethereum's supply increasing. After all, Bitcoin's supply rules are more well-known, and they simply allow a fixed amount of new Bitcoin to be issued at regular intervals that were determined in 2009. Ethereum's supply rules are more complicated because the overall supply varies based on multiple factors including transaction fees. Like Bitcoin, Ethereum issues some new supply to reward validators who secure the network. The specific amount of new supply issued varies depending on how much Ethereum is staked by validators. To offset this new supply, some of the transaction fees paid by Ethereum users are ""burned"" or destroyed. If transaction fees are high enough, the Ethereum being burned will more than offset the amount of new supply issued. This leads to a deflationary supply. On the other hand, if transaction fees are low, then the amount of Ethereum burned will be lower than the amount of new supply issued to validators. This results in an inflationary supply. When proto-danksharding caused a large drop in transaction fees, it reduced the amount of Ethereum being burned. In turn, this caused Ethereum's recent supply inflation. Impact on Ethereum Users Lower transaction fees should be a net positive for Ethereum users because it reduces the overhead cost of performing transactions. This makes transactions more cost-effective overall, and is especially impactful for frequent and low-value transactions. ycharts The above chart shows Ethereum daily transactions over the past year. Overall, it's been very stable at about 1.1 million transactions per day - even after the Dencun upgrade in March. However, this doesn't mean the Dencun upgrade failed. The above chart only considers ""layer 1"" transactions, which are pretty much capped at this point due to space constraints on the Ethereum blockchain. The Dencun upgrade targeted ""layer 2"" transactions, which bundle many users' transactions into a single ""layer 1"" transaction to save space and reduce transaction fees. There are many ""layer 2"" networks built on top of Ethereum, but we can see that the most popular ones began processing significantly more transactions starting in March: theblock.co As shown in the above chart, Arbitrum's average daily transaction volume more than doubled from less than 1 million transactions before the Dencun upgrade to over 2 million afterward. Base experienced an even larger increase and recently processed over 3 million transactions in a day. While that's still only about 1% of the volume of a large payment processor like MasterCard, it's an impressive increase in a short amount of time. Based on these metrics, we can conclude that the Dencun upgrade's lower transaction fees have already been a net positive for Ethereum users. Thanks to these lower fees, people can transact more frequently and economically. Impact on Investors Ethereum's current inflation rate is negligible from an investment perspective. While Ethereum technically used to be deflationary, it was barely noticeable; Ethereum's overall supply has fluctuated by less than 1% since 2022's switch to proof of stake. And since the March Dencun upgrade, Ethereum's supply has inflated by only 0.1%. That's less than 1% inflation on an annual basis, which is lower than the average inflation rate of traditional stores of value like gold and silver. Moreover - unlike with gold, silver, or even Bitcoin - investors can stake their Ethereum to earn a yield that offsets inflation. Even if one uses an expensive centralized staking service like Coinbase, they should be able to earn about a 2.5% annual yield. This is more than enough to offset 1% supply inflation. Even those who don't stake their Ethereum could theoretically benefit from the Dencun upgrade if lower transaction fees lead to more demand for Ethereum. This increased demand could offset dilution from inflation. Considering its relatively stable supply, the Ethereum bull thesis has always been more about increased adoption (and perhaps weakness in the USD) than about deflation. While the switch to inflation should theoretically have little to no impact on the Ethereum bull thesis, investors are not always rational. After Ethereum was marketed as a deflationary asset for the past two years, some investors may view the switch to inflation as a failure of their investment thesis. At a minimum, it's fair to say that Ethereum's supply rules are proving to be more complex and unpredictable than some investors might have expected. For example, while Ethereum could end up being deflationary again in the future if users place significantly more transactions, it's virtually impossible to predict if or when this will happen. Conclusion Ethereum's switch from deflation to inflation is an interesting development that's worth understanding. This article showed how Ethereum's supply works and why the Dencun upgrade caused it to become inflationary. However, in the big scheme of things, this is a relatively minor development that shouldn't change the long term outlook for Ethereum bulls. Bulls should instead turn their attention towards larger developments such as new functionality enabled by the Dencun upgrade, plans for similar upgrades in the future, and the upcoming Ethereum ETFs.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | FORKS,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702548-ethereum-becomes-inflationary-again-what-it-means-for-investors?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/30461541.jpeg

The prospect of bitcoins from defunct crypto exchange Mt. Gox and the German government hitting exchanges has sent the price plunging 10% in the past seven days.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} traders expect prices to drop to as low as $50,000, a level not seen since mid-February, in the coming weeks, as the largest cryptocurrency by market cap could face billions of dollars worth of selling pressure.  BTC prices have nosedived more than 10% in the past seven days, CoinGecko data shows, falling below a critical technical indicator on Thursday and erasing all gains since the end of February.  Trading firms such as QCP Capital have attributed the bearish sentiment to wallet activity from a German government entity and defunct crypto exchange Mt. Gox, and some market analysts say there’s more pain ahead.  “Bitcoin selling pressure is unlikely to decrease in the coming days,” said Rachel Lin, founder at on-chain crypto exchange SynFutures, in an interview. “The German government still has over $2.3 billion worth of Bitcoin, Mt. Gox has more than $8 billion, and the US government has over $12 billion.  “The market expects most Mt. Gox users to dump their tokens, but we might see a bounce back if the selling is lower than anticipated. On the other hand, if there is enough selling to push the price lower, we might be looking at the $50,000 level soon,” she said.  Alex Kuptsikevich, a FxPro senior market analyst, echoed the sentiment in an email to CoinDesk: “Bitcoin dropped below the 200-day moving average and has so far been unable to bounce back above it, trying to stay within established patterns.  “From the current position, a further drop to $51,000 (February consolidation area) is more likely than the same amount of growth to $65,000,” Kuptsikevich added. Moving averages are a measure of an asset’s closing prices in a time frame that can help identify a trading opportunity.  Mt. Gox started distributing bitcoin and bitcoin cash stolen from clients in a 2014 hack on Friday, sending BTC down 8% as traders reacted.  In addition, a wallet connected to the German Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) has moved millions of dollars worth of bitcoin to crypto exchanges since mid-June. Traders say these movements imply an intention to sell the assets that were forfeited in 2013 from a piracy marketplace.  Meanwhile, BTC prices seemed to briefly recover mid-morning in Europe, rising to nearly $55,000 from a low of $53,600 in early Asian hours.

30459918,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=628031,1720177256,"BNB Drops Below $500, Extended Bearish Trend On The Horizon?","BNB has recently fallen below the critical $500 support mark, signaling the continuation of a bearish trend. This decline reflects increased selling pressure and growing bearish sentiment within the cryptocurrency market. As BNB slips under this significant threshold, analysts and traders are closely watching for further downward movement, potentially targeting lower support levels. The breach of the $500 mark is a key indicator of ongoing market weakness, suggesting that BNB may face continued challenges in the near term. With the help of technical indicators to provide comprehensive insights into potential future movements, key support levels to watch, and strategies for investors and traders to navigate the ongoing downturn, this article explores the bearish sentiment surrounding BNB’s price. At the time of writing, BNB’s price was down by over 10%, trading at about $471, with a market valuation of more than $69 billion and a trading volume of more than $2 billion. In the last 24 hours, the market capitalization of BNB has dropped by 10.88%, while trading volume has increased by 37.43%. Technical Indicators Highlight Sustained Bearish Market Conditions The price of BNB on the 4-hour chart is actively bearish trading below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). As of the time of writing, the price has made a huge drop below the $500 support mark which has triggered more bearishness for the crypto asset. With the formation of the 4-hour Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), the price of BNB is set to face further decline as the MACD histograms are trending below the zero line with strong momentum. Also, the MACD line and signal line have sharply dropped and are trending below the zero line with a good spread. On the 1-day chart, it can be observed that BNB is trading below the 100-day SMA and is attempting to drop the third bearish candlestick in a row with strong momentum. This development suggests that the price is still actively bearish and may continue to decline. Lastly, the 1-day MACD signals a potential further decline in the price of BNB since the MACD histograms are trending below the zero line with strong momentum. Both the MACD line and the MACD signal line are also observed to be trending below zero after a cross below it. What To Watch Next For BNB Current analysis reveals that the price of BNB could be heading toward the $357 support level. If BNB’s price reaches the $357 support level and breaks below, it may continue to drop to test the $202 support level and potentially move on to challenge other lower levels if it breaches the $202 level. However, should the crypto asset encounter a rejection at the $357 support level, it will begin to move upward toward the $500 level once again. If it moves above this level, it may continue to climb to test the $635 resistance level and potentially move on to test other higher levels if it breaches the $635 resistance level.

After a month-long slump that mirrored a broader cryptocurrency market downturn, DOT finds itself at a critical juncture. Technical indicators hint at a bullish reversal, with some analysts predicting a significant price surge for the interoperable blockchain darling. However, a recent spending spree by the Polkadot Foundation has cast a shadow of doubt, leaving the community divided. Falling Wedge Hints At Breakout, Analysts Eye $9 Target As technical analysis presents a potentially hopeful picture, DOT holders’ hope wavers. On the daily chart, a “falling wedge” pattern—historically a bullish indication—has been observed. This pattern suggests a price squeeze between converging trendlines, often culminating in a sharp breakout. Related Reading: Bitcoin Examined: These Critical Points Are ‘Very Bad’ For BTC, Analyst Says Renowned analyst Jonathan Carter pinpoints $6.50 as the key resistance level. A decisive break above this point could trigger a surge in buying pressure, propelling DOT towards his projected profit targets of $7.75 and even $9.00. #DOT Polkadot forming falling wedge on daily timeframe💁‍♂️ Key resistance at $6.5 – need to break for bullish structure☝️ Consider setting profit targets at $7.75 and $9.00 levels🎯 pic.twitter.com/OwPVFaPZyD — Jonathan Carter (@JohncyCrypto) July 3, 2024 The falling wedge pattern and increasing trading volume suggest a potential breakout is imminent. A successful breach of the $6.50 resistance could signal a significant shift in market sentiment, paving the way for a substantial price increase. Buoying this optimism is the Relative Strength Index (RSI), currently hovering around 48.65. This neutral level indicates that DOT is neither overbought nor oversold, leaving room for further upward momentum. Polkadot Foundation’s Spending Spree However, a recent spending spree by the Polkadot Foundation has injected a dose of skepticism into the bullish narrative. Earlier this year, the Foundation burned through a staggering $87 million, leaving its coffers with a significantly reduced balance. The breakdown reveals $36.7 million allocated for advertising and events, $15 million for trading platform incentives, and $23 million for development. While the Foundation maintains these investments are crucial for boosting network visibility and adoption, community members are not convinced. Many point out that despite the hefty spending, Polkadot continues to lag behind competitors like Ethereum and Solana in key metrics like network activity, developer engagement, and total value locked (TVL). Related Reading: Worldcoin Sentiment Improves, But March Highs Remain A Distant Dream The spending seems excessive, especially considering the lack of tangible results, some community members on the Polkadot forum said. The blockchain needs to see a better return on investment before the Foundation throws more money at marketing campaigns, they said. Will Spending Concerns Spook Investors? The coming days will be crucial for DOT. If the technical indicators hold true and the price breaks above $6.50, a significant rally could be in the cards. However, the community’s concerns about the Foundation’s spending habits cannot be ignored. If these concerns translate into a broader sell-off, the potential breakout might fizzle.

30451946,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=627994,1720166418,"Bitcoin Price Crashes Below $54,000: Top-5 Reasons","In the last four days, the Bitcoin price has plummeted over 15%, with a significant 7.8% drop occurring in just the past 24 hours. From a high of nearly $72,000 in early June, the price of BTC has now declined by almost 25%. Here are the key factors behind yesterday’s dramatic fall in price. #1 Mt. Gox’s Bitcoin Repayments The impending distribution of 142,000 BTC by the defunct crypto exchange Mt. Gox has significantly stirred market anxiety. This amount, representing 0.68% of the total Bitcoin supply, is slated for distribution among the creditors of the exchange, which ceased operations in 2014 due to a major hacking event. The distribution process has already seen large transfers, with 52,633 BTC moved in recent hours, suggesting that preparations are underway for a large-scale disbursement. Market observers and analysts are closely monitoring these movements, as the potential for massive selling by these creditors could inject considerable volatility into the market. The psychological impact of this distribution has presumably led to preemptive selling among Bitcoin holders, further amplifying market jitters. #2 German Government The German government’s decision to begin liquidating its Bitcoin holdings has sent ripples through the market as well, with transactions recorded on major exchanges such as Bitstamp, Coinbase, and Kraken. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Could Massively Crash Like In May 2021, Warns Fund Manager Over a fortnight, the government reduced its holdings from 50,000 BTC to 42,274 BTC. Market participants are understandably nervous that a continuous sell-off by a major holder like a government could lead to downward price pressure. #3 Massive Long Liquidations The Bitcoin market has experienced a sharp increase in the liquidation of long positions, with a record $212 million worth of BTC liquidated just in the past 48 hours. This liquidation is the most significant since April 13, when $261 million worth of BTC longs were liquidated, leading to a steep decline in Bitcoin’s price from $68,500 to $61,600. Such liquidations often trigger a chain reaction, leading to forced sell-offs and further price declines. These liquidations are indicative of a highly leveraged market where investors might be overextended, contributing to heightened market volatility. #4 BTC Miner Capitulation Post the Bitcoin halving event on April 20, 2024, the mining reward was halved from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC, escalating economic pressures on miners. This reward reduction was anticipated to increase Bitcoin’s price, but the increase did not materialize, leaving miners with diminishing returns. Related Reading: Glassnode: Bitcoin $110,000 Target Holds, Breaking These Key Levels Crucial To Avoid Crash The current capitulation among miners is akin to previous market bottoms, such as the one seen following the FTX collapse, researchers from CryptoQuant recently revealed. Indicators of miner distress, including a significant 7.7% drop in hashrate and a plummet in mining revenue per hash to near all-time lows, means that many miners were forced to turn off their equipment and sell the BTC stash. #5 Slowdown In US Spot Bitcoin ETF Activity Contrary to expectations of a buoyant market driven by institutional investments through spot Bitcoin ETFs, there has been a noticeable slowdown in this sector. The anticipated “second wave” of institutional money has failed to materialize thus far, leading to subdued activity in the ETF space. Instead, the spot ETFs are currently experiencing a summer lull. The enthusiasm surrounding Bitcoin ETFs has been unable to counteract the overwhelmingly negative market sentiment; however, its direct impact remains relatively minor. Leading on-chain analyst James “Checkmate” Check recently estimated that only 20% of the spot volume is attributable to spot ETFs, with the remainder stemming from traditional spot markets. Over recent weeks, long-term BTC holders have been selling off their holdings in significant numbers, which has been the primary driver of the downward pressure on the market. At press time, BTC traded at $54,434.

42417771,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZvMj,1720163141,U.S. Nonfarm Payrolls Eyed as Bitcoin Heads for Largest Weekly Loss Since FTX's Collapse,"Mt. Gox fears have put BTC on a path to its largest weekly decline since November 2022.  Weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs growth could put a floor under BTC, according to Bitfinex.  The payrolls data due Friday is expected to show that the pace of job additions slowed sharply in June.  As the sell-off in bitcoin {{BTC}} becomes unhinged, one analyst is pinning hopes on Friday's U.S. jobs report to temper the decline.  Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, dipped below $54,000 early Friday amid reports that the defunct exchange Mt. Gox moved BTC worth $2.6 billion, supposedly for creditor repayments. Later on, Mt. Gox said that it has begun repayments to its customers, which led to a subdued reaction from bitcoin.  As of writing, the cryptocurrency was down over 13% for the week, the most significant single-week percentage decline since FTX's collapse in November 2022, according to CoinDesk data and TradingView.  The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics is set to release the nonfarm payrolls (NFP) report for June on Friday at 12:30 UTC (08:00 UTC). According to the consensus forecast of economists surveyed by FactSet, the NFP data is expected to show the economy added 190,000 jobs in June, a significant moderation from May's 272,000 additions while maintaining the jobless rate steady at 4%.  In a potentially positive news on the inflation rate, the average hourly earnings growth is forecast to slow to 0.3% in June from 0.4% in May, equating to a 3.9% year-on-year rise, down from May's 4.1%.  The primary concerns for macro traders, who have been dipping their toes in the BTC market since 2020, are the timing and number of Fed rate cuts. Since last Friday's soft U.S. PCE inflation data, traders have nearly priced in two rate cuts for this year, according to the CME's FedWatch tool.  The so-called dovish, pro-risk assets expectations will likely strengthen further if Friday's jobs figure shows weaker-than-expected jobs growth, according to Jag Kooner, head of derivatives at the crypto exchange Bitfinex.  ""If the NFP report shows weaker-than-expected job growth, it could increase expectations for future rate cuts, which might bolster bitcoin prices as investors seek alternative assets in anticipation of a looser monetary policy,"" Kooner told CoinDesk in an email.  Kooner explained that inflows into the spot bitcoin ETFs listed in the U.S., preferred by macro traders and institutions, could pick up the pace if ""market participants believe economic uncertainty will drive the Fed toward eventual rate cuts.""  Kooner, however, warned that the magnitude of inflows will be impacted by overall market sentiment and demand for risk assets in general.  ""However, significant inflows would depend on broader market sentiment and risk appetite. Currently, however, we've recently seen quite underwhelming flows and a lack of ""dip-buying,"" Kooner said. ""If the job market appears more resilient, bitcoin might face downward pressure as the likelihood of near-term rate cuts diminishes.""",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/07/05/us-nonfarm-payrolls-eyed-as-bitcoin-heads-for-largest-weekly-loss-since-ftxs-collapse,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3eff82a144368e28aaab192edebdd8cdea76120b-997x561.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The company's profits are attributed to Bitcoin's fair value changes, which may become negative given its recent declines. Riot Platforms has raised over $1B in investor cash on a TTM basis, which is nearly half of its current market value. This suggests significant and potentially fruitless equity dilution. The company may have some support from its tangible book value. To me, that depends on whether or not its physical investments can be used for non-Bitcoin activities. RIOT's political risk appears high as more voters and politicians question its voracious power needs, which can be argued to provide limited general economic benefit, particularly given ERCOT's grid difficulties. In December of 2021, I published a bearish view regarding the blockchain mining company Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) in "" Why Riot Blockchain May Never Generate Consistent Profits ."" The stock has declined by ~64% despite a significant Bitcoin rally over the past year. RIOT is also down 28% YoY despite an 86% increase in Bitcoin's value. Analyst sentiment remains very mixed, with many bullish and bearish outlooks. Given Bitcoin is back at a high level and facing some stagnation to its rally, I believe it is another excellent time to analyze Riot Platforms. The company has changed over the past two and a half years, and the cryptocurrency market has shifted even more, going through a full negative and positive cycle since. With Bitcoin at a high, we should imagine Riot's current profit level may be in the higher range of its forward potential. Thus, it may be headed for even greater financial pressures if it cannot earn a consistent profit after years of development and higher cryptocurrency prices. Further, with Bitcoin crashing by over 5% on Thursday, we must consider RIOT's exposure to a potential reversal in Bitcoin's value. Bitcoin May Have No Value in the Long Run Over a decade ago, Riot's business model likely would have sounded nonsensical to most people. The company owns massive Bitcoin ""mining"" facilities through data centers. This requires Gigawatts of power , enough energy to power hundreds of thousands of homes. Mind you, its operations are focused in Texas, which has had notorious difficulty with the ERCOT grid in recent years due to rising demand. As such, Texas has paid Riot Platforms through energy credits to avoid consuming power during peak demand periods. The company has reported this as "" providing power ,"" but it is more than not using it during high-demand periods and getting paid for that. All of this power is used to make more Bitcoins. Those who have read my work know that I do not believe Bitcoin is a viable currency, given its poor transaction efficiency "" scalability problem ."" What I understand is not necessarily important in the short-term, as if people believe in Bitcoin, it will have value. However, in the long run, I think it will likely be other cryptocurrencies that do not have scalability issues and extremely excessive power demand requirements that prove viable. Riot may adapt to this by shifting toward other cryptocurrencies. Of course, potentially viable alternatives like Ripple cannot be mined. I argue that ""mining"" is a crucial issue with many cryptocurrencies. Riot's servers are dedicated to solving ""complex cryptographic puzzles"" that become more difficult once Bitcoins are mined, artificially limiting supply growth. This validates transactions, but in a highly inefficient manner where the transaction ledger must be updated across a comprehensive decentralized platform of miners. Cryptocurrencies like XRP that do not use this inefficient method can do transactions in seconds (as opposed to ~30 minutes) at much lower power costs. For me, Riot Platform is far too dependent on Bitcoin, a Dinosaur in the cryptocurrency market—the vast majority like Bitcoin for its speculative volatility. Most people think of Bitcoin in terms of its dollar value, directly implying that its value compared to fiat currency is more important than its value as a replacement of fiat currency. This is to say that Bitcoin has value only because people think it has value - not because it can replace fiat currency. Rising Power Retail Prices Signal Political Risk The most significant issue with its profitability is the cost of power. Including all of its facilities, its power cost was 2.6c/kWh last month . Due to seasonal fluctuations, its annual average power cost should be above that level. Its power costs are far below retail levels due to long-term power contracts and its effort to buy at low-cost periods and avoid consumption during peak demand. Since it has contracts to buy, it has earned sales by selling this pre-contracted power during expensive periods. It could be argued that its most profitable business segment is these gains from not operating. Still, there is a generally positive trend in Texas' power costs, likely partially driven by rising demand from industrial sources like Riot. See below: Data by YCharts Given Texas ' power grid issues, it is unclear if Riot will manage very low power costs indefinitely. Key figures in the Texas state government sought to survey its power consumption in an ""emergency survey."" However, Riot, with aid from the Texas Blockchain Council, blocked this through a lawsuit, leading to the destruction of all relevant data . From this, I conclude that Riot's exposure to political strains will likely grow, as people and politicians may see it as an enormous drain of scarce power that is not going to a clear economic purpose. Of course, I am confident that Riot would argue that mining Bitcoin serves some purpose, but politicians and voters struggling with rising electricity bills may disagree. Unprofitable In Good Times and Bad Most cryptocurrency-centric stocks are highly correlated to Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies. RIOT has partially lost its correlation to Bitcoin, given its operating income has collapsed to terribly negative levels despite an increase in revenue. See below: Data by YCharts Critical differences exist between how YCharts accounts for Riot's operating income and how the company does. Per its annual report , we can see that it counts changes to Bitcoin's value as an operating factor, whereas such (changes to fair value) are more typically viewed as non-operating, which is how YCharts accounts. Riot's operating income is very negative, attributable to its relatively low profit margins after its power costs and other overhead. Of course, if we add back depreciation and amortization, or ""net operating income,"" we can see it closer to breakeven but still generally below that threshold. Further, by looking at the difference between its operating income and net income (per YCharts' accounting), we can see its exposure to Bitcoin's price. See below: Data by YCharts Riot Platform holds around 9.33K in BTC , which is worth around $538M at today's price. As the price of Bitcoin rose in 2023, the company reported a positive change in the fair value of Bitcoin of $184.7M ( 10-K pg. 42 ). That figure is the primary driver of its positive net income on a TTM basis. However, even if we deduct all depreciation (some of which will be realized as its assets age), the company does not earn a consistent profit on its core operations, primarily mining. The Bottom Line I am skeptical of Riot Platform's current business model. Not only is the premise of Bitcoin mining likely flawed (in my opinion), as well as the concept of Bitcoin-as-a-currency, but it has also failed to earn a positive net operating income even during a period of high Bitcoin prices. Of course, that point can be debated based on how we account for changes to Bitcoin's fair value. Its income is positive due to unrealzied gains on higher BTC prices. Now that we're seeing negative pressure in BTC, it seems that those gains could become losses. From an operational standpoint, its most profitable activity is not using the power it bought at a lower cost. That is interesting, but I do not believe it will be an avenue for long-term consistent profitability. Today, its Bitcoin production is down dramatically YoY as it continues to shift toward lower production at greater Hash Rate efficiency. While Riot's strategy has failed to earn consistent profits in a would-be-strong period, it has some value. The company owns electronic assets, some of which could theoretically be converted into a traditional data center if it shifted away from Bitcoin. The critical issue with this is that most of its computational power comes from Application-Specific Integrated Circuits instead of CPUs and GPUs. These ""ASIC"" chips are specifically designed for cryptocurrency mining and use more power to do so more efficiently. If the cryptocurrency mining market fails due to a prolonged decline in cryptocurrency prices or higher power costs, these components may be of little value. Still, Riot has no material financial debt and other valuable assets. Its tangible book value per share is $9.15, which is near its current share price of $9.6. Its cash position is historically high at $688M. That said, its value is at high dilution risk. The company is likely losing cash on an operational basis today and is instead utilizing tremendous cash from financing via very aggressive share sales. See below: Data by YCharts On a TTM basis, the company raised ~$1.09B from financing (primarily equity sales). However, its market capitalization is only $2.76B, so continued dilution at this pace could rapidly deteriorate equity holders' value. In other words, the company is raising a lot of cash from investors and has failed to show a positive ROI from these investments. While its tangible book is near its market capitalization, I estimate that its liquidation value would be below its book value as I do not believe its chips are worth what they've paid for them, given I also think the Bitcoin mining industry is inherently unsustainable. Compared to its peers, Riot does have a lower valuation based on price-to-sales and price-to-book. See below: Data by YCharts It is larger and more established within its industry but has a weakened reputation due to low returns on equity-dilutive investments. Consistently positive operating profits are unseen in the industry, so it isn't easy to distinguish between their valuations. I feel that companies can bring in a great deal of money from retail investors interested in popular trends or capitalizing on ""FOMO."" In my experience, genuinely profitable growth industries usually focus on private capital markets with access to ""smart money."" Those firms who can garner media attention with popular media buzzwords like ""Bitcoin,"" ""AI,"" and similar may find public markets a better avenue to raise capital, given institutional investors are more likely to be skeptical of its profitability potential. This is not to say that Riot or its peers are dishonest, only that retail investors should understand that companies can earn a lot of money from retail investors through equity sales if investors are willing to overlook profitability potential consistently. In my opinion, retail investors in RIOT are overlooking its failure to earn a positive income despite massive projects that have required immense equity investor capital dilution. Again, if it cannot earn a solid operating profit during high Bitcoin periods, I do not see how it can thrive in the long term. My view is based on my belief that Bitcoin's feasibility as a currency is very low. I am sure some may disagree with my opinion. However, even if we assume Bitcoin maintains the $50K to $100K range, it is unclear if Riot will see consistent positive operating cash flows. For these reasons, I am bearish on RIOT and expect it will decline due to equity dilution, negative operating income, and potentially significant losses, given recent declines in BTC-USD. That said, I would not short-sell RIOT. RIOT's short interest is 20%, giving it some risk of a positive breakout in a short squeeze. Although I am bearish on Bitcoin, it could continue to rise where Riot may temporarily see improved profits. Lastly, and most importantly, if we assume Riot ends its equity dilution habit, its tangible net asset value may not be dramatically below its market capitalization. The company has a strong cash position and physical assets likely have some value even if it ended its mining focus. That said, I cannot provide a feasible value estimate for its physical assets because we're not seeing a positive net operating income. Still, I think RIOT is overvalued broadly due to dilutions (and generally negative returns on investment) and not necessarily due to a significant premium to its theoretical net asset value.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702509-riot-platforms-a-cash-burning-machine-even-in-the-crypto-bull-market?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/30449508.jpeg

Bitcoin As Valuable Asset Class For State Treasury In a letter addressed to the government, Cotar emphasized that BTC has gained recognition as a genuine asset class and a promising investment for the future due to its remarkable price surge. The lawmaker highlighted that traditional financial institutions now view Bitcoin as a real asset with properties similar to “digital gold,” making it suitable for the state treasury. Related Reading: Solana Meme Coins Outperform Ethereum 800% YTD – Top Winners Revealed Cotar pointed out that governments worldwide are reevaluating Bitcoin to foster innovation within the ecosystem or enforce stricter regulations on Bitcoin ownership and transactions. However, she acknowledged that understanding the benefits of Bitcoin can be challenging for individuals, and the same applies to governments and politicians. Cotar underscored that a well-designed Bitcoin strategy has the potential to reshape a country’s development, foster economic prosperity, and safeguard fundamental human freedoms for all citizens. As BTC continues to gain acceptance globally, she believes more nations will consider integrating it into their financial and economic systems. Interestingly, Cotar outlined several advantages for the German government in retaining its Bitcoin holdings instead of selling them. BTC Strategy For Germany Firstly, including Bitcoin in the treasury alongside traditional fiat currencies and gold reserves diversifies a nation’s assets, reducing risks associated with overexposure to a single asset class. Second, the lawmaker highlighted Bitcoin’s scarcity and deflationary nature, which makes it an attractive alternative for wealth preservation. By holding Bitcoin as part of the national treasury, Cotar believes that the government can protect national reserves from inflation and currency devaluation beyond its control. Furthermore, Cotar highlighted that including Bitcoin in the treasury can enhance overall portfolio performance, as various studies have shown that Bitcoin’s risk-adjusted returns surpass those of traditional investments like stocks and bonds over the long term. Related Reading: Solana Eases Gains: Can SOL Bulls Safeguard the $132 Support? Cotar, who has long been a proponent of making Bitcoin legal tender in Germany through appropriate legislation, further argued that developing a favorable regulatory framework for all Bitcoin-related activities can open doors for new businesses and technological progress while paving the way for further economic development in the country. Cotar concluded by emphasizing that a Bitcoin-friendly legal framework will promote research and development in the financial and technology sectors, attract top talent, and foster collaboration between private companies, government institutions, and the scientific community. Sell-Off Continues, Putting Pressure On BTC Price It is worth noting that the German government sold another batch of confiscated BTC worth over $175 million on Thursday. According to data from market intelligence platform Arkham, the German authorities still hold 40,359 BTC worth approximately $2.3 billion. This, along with the US government selling off its Bitcoin holdings, caused BTC to fall as low as $56,700 on Thursday. However, the largest cryptocurrency in the market, which has seen a 17% price drop in the monthly time frame, has recovered to its current price level of $58,300.

Gox was one the leading crypto exchange, handling over 70% of bitcoin transactions in the early years.  Mt. Gox said on Friday that it started making repayments to customers, ending a near 10-year wait for some users to get their crypto back after a 2014 hack sent the crypto exchange into bankruptcy.  The company was once the world’s top crypto exchange, handling over 70% of all bitcoin {{BTC}} transactions in its early years. The hack resulted in the loss of an estimated 740,000 bitcoin.  The announcement added selling pressure on bitcoin and the broader crypto market after Mt. Gox announced last month its intention to start repayments in July.  Bitcoin plunged to as low as $53,600, its lowest level in five months. The freefall led to over $580 million in bullish bets being liquidated. The world's largest digital asset remained under $55,000 mid-morning in Europe, according to CoinDesk Indices data. It started the week close to $63,000.  ""Mt. Gox moved 47,228 BTC, signaling the start of their repayment process, which has caused some market fear due to the large potential sell-off ... However, it's worth noting that despite these concerns, the long-term impact may be less severe as the market gradually absorbs the selling pressure,"" said Willy Chuang, COO of crypto exchange WOO X.  Some customers may have to wait as long as 60-90 days to receive their payouts, but Mark Karpeles, the exchange's former CEO, confirmed in a direct message to CoinDesk on X that these are worst-case figures.  ""Those are deadlines linked to the number of transfers to process, each exchange might have a slightly different internal policy and decide to credit everyone later than sooner or sooner than later,"" he said.

Miners, who provide computing power to blockchain networks are facing significant operational costs.  Only five mining rigs are profitable for their operators as bitcoin {{BTC}} slumped to the $54,000 mark this week, creating a scenario that could mark a “local bottom.""  “At a rate of $0.08/kWh, ASICs less efficient than 23 W/T operate at a loss,” mining giant F2Pool said in a graph released early Friday. A kWh or kilowatt-hour measures the energy usage of an electrical device or load.  F2Pool’s graph shows four of Antminer’s various rigs and one Avalon rig that are profitable as long as prices are above $53,100. All other miners are now costing more to run than the rewards received by operators.  Miners are entities that supply computing power to any blockchain network in return for “rewards” in the form of tokens. These rewards are continually sold by miners to cover operational costs – which are fairly intensive, with some miners even filing for bankruptcy in the past few years.  Miners were a major source of bitcoin selling pressure in June with over $1 billion worth of BTC sold over two weeks as prices ranged between the $65,000 and $70,000 levels, as previously reported.  Meanwhile, some market observers say miners' unprofitability could mark a local bottom as there is less selling pressure.  “Bitcoin miners are (an) inch away from capitulation, S19 break even at 52k,” said Dovey Wan, partner at crypto fund Primitive Crypto, in an X post on Friday. “This is a perfect setup for local bottom.”",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | MINING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/07/05/as-bitcoin-bellyflops-to-54k-only-five-mining-rigs-remain-profitable-says-f2pool,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3c41a0231d78933b542741460696230f0d9d80a7-4802x2701.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

QCP Analysts Spot Signs of Capitulation as Prices Tumble Below $59K,"Recent trading patterns have led QCP Capital, a prominent trading firm, to highlight potential signs of a market bottom in the crypto market. Bitcoin, the leading digital currency, recently dipped below $58,000, causing analysts to focus on the behavior of miners and their possible capitulation. Such capitulation could indicate a market bottom, similar to past market cycles. In 2022, a parallel hash rate drop saw Bitcoin prices plummet to $17,000, suggesting a recurring theme that could signal an upcoming rebound. Related Reading: Buckle Up: Here Is Why Bitcoin Might Just Be Gearing Up For a 200% Surge Bitcoin Bottom In? Bitcoin’s fall from the critical $60,000 support level to a current low below $58,000 at the time of writing has triggered discussions among QCP’s analysts. In their latest update on Telegram, they describe this downturn as aligned with historical precedents that usually precede significant price recoveries. This trend suggests that while the market appears bearish, underlying movements might hint at an emerging bullish scenario. Despite the market’s downward trajectory, QCP remains optimistic about the potential for recovery, driven by specific market mechanisms and upcoming financial products. The options market, specifically in Ethereum (ETH), is seeing a skew towards call options for upcoming months, reflecting a bullish sentiment among traders. Additionally, QCP analysts have identified significant liquidation clusters for Bitcoin and Ethereum that, if triggered, could lead to aggressive short squeezes, potentially driving up prices. QCP has also proposed a strategic ETH trading strategy using KIKOs (Knock-In, Knock-Out options) to capitalize on market volatility while protecting against severe downside risks. This strategy underlines the firm’s anticipation of positive shifts in the ETH market, possibly fueled by the approval of new financial products like the anticipated S-1 forms for Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). BTC Sharp Decline Amid Widespread Liquidations In the last 24 hours, Bitcoin and Ethereum have experienced notable declines, with prices falling to $58,057 and $3,134, respectively. This downturn has significantly affected the trading community, with Coinglass reporting total market liquidations of approximately $387.78 million; a large portion involved Bitcoin and Ethereum. The liquidation patterns suggest a predominance of long positions, indicating that many traders expected a price increase, which did not materialize. While the immediate market conditions appear grim, deeper analysis by crypto experts like Crypto Patel suggests this could be the precursor to a more significant market movement. Related Reading: Crypto Carnage: Nearly $200 Million Liquidated as Bitcoin Slips Below $61,000 Patel’s analysis points to Bitcoin dropping to lows of around $55,000, a sentiment that may appear negative to others who remain optimistic that the bottom is in and surge is next. #Bitcoin Analysis Update 🚨 Hope you followed my analysis! $BTC hit Break of Structure (BOS) and made a new low, perfectly rejecting from the Bearish OB.

42417783,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZvW1,1720155666,Labour Landslide Sets Up Starmer as UK Prime Minister With Unstated Crypto Plans,"The U.K.'s Labour Party won a landslide victory in Thursday's general election.  Crypto was not mentioned in the party's election manifesto, but Labour has previously commented on tokenization and the digital pound.  The Labour Party won Thursday's U.K. general election with a landslide that ended 14 years of Conservative rule and will install Keir Starmer as prime minister with a legislative program that leaves the direction of crypto regulation unclear.  Labour won well over the 326 seats needed for a majority, with BBC reporting it held 412 seats as of 11:19 British Summer Time (10:19 UTC) Friday, relegating the Tories – as the Conservative Party is known – to 121 with two results still to be declared. Neither party mentioned the crypto industry in their manifestos in the lead-up to the election. Labour concentrated on the economy, police and the National Health Service.  The Conservative's stance on crypto, by virtue of its long tenure in government, is clearer. The party had said it wanted the country to be a crypto hub, enacted legislation for crypto to be treated as a regulated activity and consulted on future plans including stablecoin rules. Bim Afolami, who served as Economic Secretary under outgoing Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, graced the stages of many fintech conferences and had promised the government would issue secondary legislation for stablecoins.  Labour, for its part, has said it will support the Bank of England's digital pound plans. A decision on whether to issue the central bank digital currency (CBDC) will be taken by the bank in 2025-2026. Before that happens, the Parliament will need to approve the appropriate legislation.  Read more: Digital Pound Legislation Will Provide Protections to Privacy and Control, Govt Says  In a victory speech early Friday, Starmer said, ""change begins now.""  ""Four and a half years of work, changing the party, this is what it is for: a changed Labour Party ready to serve our country, ready to restore Britain to the service of working people,"" he said.  Rachel Reeves will take over as Chancellor of the Exchequer, meaning she will head the country's Treasury department.  ""The Labour Party has won this general election and I have called Keir Starmer to congratulate him,"" Sunak said in a concession speech early Friday. ""The British people have delivered a sobering verdict tonight.""  Hours later Sunak said he will resign as leader of the Conservative party.  Room to do more  In January, Labour released a plan for financial services that included making the country a securities tokenization hub by ""advancing work to clarify the law around tokenization."" Tokenization is the digital representation of financial and other assets on the blockchain.  There is room for Labour to do more, members of the crypto community told CoinDesk before the election. That includes putting through the needed regulations identified by the previous government as well as enhancing guidance on promotional material for the sector.  ""A lot of the really important work has been done and it's not been done by the parties themselves, it's been done by government departments,"" Jordan Wain, U.K. policy lead at Chainalysis, told CoinDesk in an earlier interview. ""It's been done by the FCA [Financial Conduct Authority], they're the ones that are formulating legislation. They are not going to sweep all of that hard work off the table, it's not going anywhere.""  Crypto UK a lobby group that often met with regulators and ministers, advocating for the crypto community during the Tory reign, said it also has ties to members of the incoming government.  ""As the landscape evolves rapidly, CryptoUK calls on Labour to prioritise clarity and proactive policy-making to fully harness our sector’s potential,” a spokesperson said in an emailed statement. ""Despite the industry’s potential to drive job creation, economic growth and increased inclusivity, a comprehensive strategy for the UK’s crypto and digital assets industry remains elusive.""

Over the past week, ETH has experienced a significant 9% price decline, bringing it down to the $3,130 level. As market participants closely monitor the situation, the focus now lies on crucial levels that must be held back to prevent a deeper retrace that could lead to substantial losses and heightened liquidation rates not witnessed in months. Make-Or-Break Moment For Ethereum Price Crypto analyst “Inspo Crypto” has drawn attention that Ethereum’s price has retraced to levels last seen at the beginning of May. According to the analyst, the upcoming 8-hour trading period, represented by a 1-day candle, will be a critical juncture to determine whether the bulls have capitulated or can muster a comeback. Related Reading: Solana Meme Coins Outperform Ethereum 800% YTD – Top Winners Revealed A retracement above the abovementioned level could be considered a deviation from the bearish trend. However, if Ethereum fails to retest the lower trend channel at $3,170, it could pave the way for a further decline towards $2,700, consequently impacting altcoins and leading to significant losses across the market. Upward Trajectory To $5,000 if Price Holds At $3,170 The analyst further asserts that, in his opinion, Ethereum has been operating within a new trend channel since October 2013. Hence, if ETH manages to hold its price within the range of $3,170 without breaking down, it would confirm an upward trajectory towards $5,000. It is important to note that this timeframe extends until the end of the year. Additionally, it should be considered that Ethereum is still operating within a long-term trend channel. If the described scenario unfolds, it would also confirm the long-term trend channel, indicating that ETH was trapped in a bearish phase between August 2023 and February 2024 and is now embarking towards $8,000 over the coming months. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that this analysis does not account for external factors such as monetary policy decisions or geopolitical conflicts. Nevertheless, if Ethereum manages to hold the $3,170 level and begins an upward ascent, the possibility of an altcoin season becomes increasingly feasible, as suggested by the analyst. Related Reading: Bitcoin Alert: Mt. Gox Starts Repayments With Small Exchange Transfer Ultimately, ETH’s next moves will affect its trajectory and impact the broader crypto landscape, particularly the altcoin market, which has also seen significant losses in recent days. ETH trades at $3,130 at the time of writing, reflecting a 5% decline in the past 24 hours. As a result, it becomes crucial that the token closes above the aforementioned critical level of $3,170 in the coming hours to prevent potential additional losses, as emphasized by the analyst.

The price is now gaining bearish momentum and might even test $420. BNB price started a major decline below the $550 support zone. The price is now trading below $500 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $495 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair (data source from Binance). The pair could extend losses and even test the $420 support in the near term. BNB Price Dives 20% In the past few days, BNB price saw a steady decline from the $580 resistance, like Ethereum and Bitcoin. In the past 2-3 sessions, the bears took control and pushed the price below the $500 support zone. The price is down 20% and it even spiked below the $475 support. A low was formed at $466.1 and the price is now showing a lot of bearish signs. There are hardly any signs of a recovery wave, and the price is well below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $580 swing high to the $466 low. The price is now trading below $500 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. If there is a recovery wave, the price could face resistance near the $485 level. The next resistance sits near the $492 level. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $495 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair. A clear move above the $495 zone could send the price higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test $520 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $580 swing high to the $466 low. A close above the $520 resistance might set the pace for a larger increase toward the $535 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of the $550 level in the coming days. More Losses? If BNB fails to clear the $492 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $465 level. The next major support is near the $455 level. The main support sits at $450. If there is a downside break below the $450 support, the price could drop toward the $432 support. Any more losses could initiate a larger decline toward the $420 level. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for BNB/USD is gaining pace in the bearish zone.

Ether {{ETH}} dropped more than 10%, Solana’s SOL and Cardano’s ADA fell 8%, while dogecoin {{DOGE}} dived nearly 18%.  Coinalyze data shows that this caused over $580 million in liquidations tied to longs, or bets on higher prices, in one of the largest such events so far this year. Bullish bets on bitcoin and ether together recorded over $380 million in losses.  The largest single liquidation order was on Binance—an ETH trade valued at $18.4 million. Meanwhile, open interest—or the number of unsettled futures bets—dropped 12%, indicating money was leaving the market.  Liquidations occur when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. It happens when a trader cannot meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position (fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open).  Such moves came as defunct exchange Mt. Gox moved sizeable amounts of BTC to a new wallet, potentially preparing for creditor repayments. Mt.

30441683,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=627926,1720152004,Bitcoin Plunging: Is This The Best Time To Buy BTC?,"Bitcoin is fast selling off. At spot rates, the world’s most valuable coin dropped by over 5% on the last day of trading and continues to spiral lower, easily breaking $60,000. The psychological round number has been level to watch out for over the previous few days, especially following gains over the weekend. Bitcoin Is Down: Is It Time To Buy? While Bitcoin is edging lower and sellers are relentless, one analyst thinks this is the right time to stack up. In a post on X, the analyst argues that Bitcoin is on the cusp of the “Spring” phase within the Wyckoff re-accumulation model. The Wyckoff model is a technical analysis tool used by traders and chartists. Traditionally, it uses price and volume patterns to identify potential price movements. Related Reading: Crypto Market In Panic As Bitcoin Crash To $57,000 Sends 105,000 Traders To The Slaughter While Wyckoff describes multiple phases when it comes to price patterns, the “Spring” stage is what most traders always track. When prices “spring” higher from this stage, the coin tends to break out from the current range at the back of rising trading volume. Looking at the Bitcoin daily chart, it is evident that prices have been consolidating. Thus far, the primary support is around the May and June 2024 lows. Then, prices broke lower, sinking below $57,000 and bottoming at around $56,500 in May. Resistance lies between $72,000 and March 2024 highs on the upper end. As it is, Bitcoin is retesting the primary support, with the July 4 bar piercing $60,000 and dropping to as low as $56,900 earlier today. Based on the Wyckoff model, prices are priming for the spring phase. This preview will hold, especially if there is no confirmation of today’s losses. Miner Capitulating Though Long-Term Holders Are Not Selling Though the analyst is upbeat, not everyone is bullish. According to Willy Woo, an on-chain analyst, the current sell-off is primarily driven by miner capitulation. Looking at the Bitcoin Hash Ribbons, the drop appears to be getting started as the market culls off “weak” miners. Since the April 20 Halving, the Bitcoin network automatically slashed BTC rewards by half to 3.125 BTC. This automated move heaped more pressure on miners, who must invest capital to buy gear and operate efficiently. With falling revenue, only the most efficient miners stand a chance to operate profitably. Related Reading: Solana Meme Coins Outperform Ethereum 800% YTD – Top Winners Revealed As a result, those who can’t upgrade their gear are forced to exit the scene. If they don’t, they stand operating without a chance of consistently winning block rewards. Over the last eight months, on-chain data shows that miners have been offloading BTC, countering the uptrend of Q1 2024 and worsening the correction from April. Amid this, long-term holders, mostly institutions and whales, stopped selling in mid-January 2024. Then, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the first spot for the Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). As proof, the Bitcoin “illiquid supply,” which shows the number of coins that haven’t been moved for over two years, is at a near all-time high.

30439155,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=627897,1720148452,"Bitcoin Traders Sink Into ‘Fear’ As Price Crashes Below $58,000","Data shows that Bitcoin traders’ sentiment has declined into ‘fear’ after the price crash the cryptocurrency has seen during the past 24 hours. Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Is Now Suggesting A Fearful Market The “Fear & Greed Index” is an indicator created by Alternative that tells us about the average sentiment currently held by traders in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency market. The index uses a scale from zero to a hundred to represent the sentiment. The score is calculated based on five factors: volatility, trading volume, social media sentiment, market cap dominance, and Google Trends. Related Reading: These Are The Altcoins In Buy Zone, Analytics Firm Reveals All values of the indicator above 53 signify the presence of greed among the investors, while those below 47 imply fear in the market. The region between these two cutoffs naturally corresponds to a neutral mentality. Now, here is what the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index looks like currently: As is visible above, the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index has a value of 44, suggesting that the sentiment is just inside the fear territory. This is a change from what it has been like during the last few days. The chart below shows how the indicator’s value fluctuated over the past year. The graph shows that the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index had been in neutral territory during the first three days of this month, but today, on the fourth, the sentiment has plunged. The reason behind this worsening mentality is the crash that the cryptocurrency’s price has witnessed during the past day, which has taken its price under the $58,000 level. It’s also visible in the chart that the neutral sentiment in the first three days of July showed a sharp improvement over how June had ended. The metric had hit a low of 30 on two occasions to end the month as a culmination of the bearish momentum BTC had been facing. As the bearish winds seem to be picking back up for the asset now, the recovery in the sentiment may be lost soon. This may not entirely be, however, bad news for the coin. The Bitcoin price has historically tended to move against the crowd’s expectations. The chances of such a contrary move to take place grow the larger this expectation becomes. That is the more the Fear & Greed Index points in any direction. Major tops and bottoms have generally occurred when the asset has been inside the extreme greed and fear regions, respectively. Extreme greed is the territory where the index attains values higher than 75. Similarly, extreme fear occurs under 25. Related Reading: Why Did Bitcoin Plunge Under $58,000? On-Chain Data Says This If the indicator’s value continues to decline from here, it falls into the extreme fear it could be to watch for, as they may also lead towards a potential bottom for Bitcoin this time.

According to the analyst, XRP is poised to rebound from its bearish trends and soar to new all-time highs XRP To Mirror 2017 Rally To New Highs In an X (formerly Twitter) post in June, crypto analyst, Tylie Eric expressed bullish optimism about XRP, emphasizing the cryptocurrency’s potential for a major rally this year. He shared an XRP price chart depicting the cryptocurrency’s price movements from as early as 2014 to 2025. Related Reading: British Mega Bank Standard Chartered Says Bitcoin Will Hit $100,000, Here’s When Eric disclosed that XRP has met all the necessary requirements and conditions to support a potential bull rally to new highs. The analyst also revealed that XRP is completely prepared to continue with “wave 3 and wave 5” of the renowned Elliott Wave Theory. The Elliott Wave Theory is a tool used to determine price movements in a cryptocurrency. The technical analysis is based on viewing long-term recurrent price patterns in a cryptocurrency. In his post, Eric disclosed that XRP was currently displaying similar patterns and conditions to those seen during its bull rally in 2017. Earlier in 2017, XRP witnessed a massive price rally, which preceded its surge to new all-time highs of $3.84 in 2018. Eric has suggested that XRP’s price action was displaying the same bullish patterns, as a result, he has projected a substantial price increase to $36.36 before the end of 2024. The analyst also revealed that XRP will have to witness a whopping 7,637.22% surge for it can reach the projected price target. Despite being a cryptocurrency analyst, Eric is an avid supporter of the XRP cryptocurrency. The analyst has constantly made bullish predictions for the altcoin, anticipating potential rebounds from bearish sentiment. Moreover, the crypto analyst revealed in his earlier post that XRP’s price action was significantly “boring.” This could be attributed to the cryptocurrency’s recent downward spiral. As of writing, the price of XRP is trading at $0.45, reflecting a 4.12% decrease in the past 24 hours and a 11.71% drop over the past month. The popular cryptocurrency has continually recorded steep declines since the beginning of June. Previously, the cryptocurrency was consolidating slightly above $0.5, however now the cryptocurrency is on a major downward trend, triggered by market volatility and Ripple’s ongoing legal battle with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Bullish Sentiment Rises Despite its waning value, XRP’s bullish sentiment from crypto analysts continues to rise. A particular crypto analyst identified as ‘Egrag Crypto’ predicted that the altcoin was getting closer to the Fibonacci (Fib) 1.618. The analyst disclosed that this unexpected development could indicate possible areas for a price reversal or continuation in XRP. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash Is Buy Opportunity As Wallets Holding 10+ BTC Reaches New ATH Egrag Crypto also shared a price chart depicting XRP’s price actions from 2014 to 2024.

Hoskinson’s reply sparked a conversation about the state of the crypto industry and what’s valued in projects. Related Reading: Gala Games Announces Partnership With Animoca Brands, GALA Token Plunges 6.7% Cardano And Polkadot Labeled ‘Dead Coins’ On Wednesday, crypto influencer Ben Armstrong, known as BitBoy Crypto, shared his thoughts on Cardano (ADA) and Polkadot (DOT). The influencer took X to explain his previous comments, stating that both cryptocurrencies were dead. In a YouTube Video from April, Armstrong said that ADA was “dead for real.” The crypto influencer believed that this time “was different.” To him, investors had to question whether they were okay “standing on ideals” while watching their portfolio take a hit. Per the influencer, ADA’s disappointing performance was because it doesn’t have the same backing as other tokens. He explained that “numbers go up” for institutionally backed tokens. Armstrong also noted that, despite not having “awful” institutional numbers, ADA can’t compete with Ethereum (ETH) or Solana (SOL). Moreover, the influencer considers that “crypto is changing,” investors are turning their heads toward new projects to feel like they are early. On X, Armstrong reiterated his opinion about ADA and DOT, stating that both were “dead to institutions.” However, he clarified the implications of his statement. The token’s dead coin status doesn’t mean ADA and DOT won’t pump this bull run. To him, the tokens will offer returns to investors, but they will be “mid.” Charles Hoskinson Claps Back Cardano’s founder responded to Armstrong’s comments, questioning the crypto influencer’s stance. To Hoskinson, his logic goes against the ethos of crypto. “I remember when the point of cryptocurrencies was to replace institutions instead of acting out a scene from deliverance,” the post read. Armstrong’s comments ignited a discussion in the replies, with several crypto users disagreeing with his take. One X user agreed with the Cardano founder’s reply, wondering, “When did crypto become people begging for institutional investment?” Another user stated that if Satoshi Nakamoto had shared Armstrong’s logic, the crypto industry and none of us would be here. “Hinging the success of a decentralized chain on centralized entities is hustling backward,” they added. Nonetheless, some crypto investors agreed with the crypto influencer comments. A community member considered that, unlike Hoskinson, Armstrong is “at least adding content and valued entertainment into the space.” This has been a constant criticism toward the Cardano ecosystem and its founder. Cardano users defended the project, claiming that the blockchain is one of the “few that haven’t lost the DeFi plot.” Many also concurred that the ecosystem is not there for VC funds or Armstrong but for its users.

This price level has not been seen since May 1st, as Bitcoin faces several challenges, including US political uncertainties and the ongoing sell-off of BTC seized by the German government. These factors have contributed to a nearly 20% price correction for Bitcoin, causing concern among investors. Unraveling The Bitcoin Price Drop According to a recent Bloomberg report, investors are contemplating potential scenarios if President Joe Biden decides to withdraw his US reelection bid. One possibility is the emergence of a stronger Democratic contender who may pose challenges to Republican Donald Trump, whose agenda favors the crypto industry. Richard Galvin, co-founder of hedge fund Digital Asset Capital Management, highlights the likelihood of a “stronger Democratic candidate” who might not support cryptocurrencies as a factor influencing Bitcoin’s weakness in the short term. Related Reading: Solana Meme Coins Outperform Ethereum 800% YTD – Top Winners Revealed In addition, the overhang from the collapsed Mt. Gox Bitcoin exchange case, which plans to begin refunding, affected customers of the alleged hack suffered nearly 10 years ago, and the US and German government sell-off are contributing to the current weakness in the Bitcoin market. Traders are closely monitoring the risk of Bitcoin disposals by both the US and German governments, who possess seized BTC. Recent data from Arkham Intelligence reveals that a wallet associated with the German state transferred approximately $75 million worth of BTC to exchanges on Thursday, adding to a series of similar transfers. Meanwhile, administrators of the failed Mt. Gox exchange are gradually returning a substantial amount of Bitcoin to creditors, leaving speculators uncertain about the potential impact of the $8 billion haul on the market. Miners’ Response And Market Impact On the other hand, Bitcoin miners responsible for the computational power that supports the Bitcoin blockchain continue to face the financial consequences of the Halving event, which reduces the number of new tokens they receive as a reward. As a response, some miners are selling a portion of their token inventory, adding to the selling pressure on Bitcoin. This ongoing battle with selling pressure from miners is affecting Bitcoin’s price performance, as highlighted by Noelle Acheson, author of the Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter. However, Acheson notes that the sentiment in the crypto market can quickly change, especially if weaker US economic data instigates expectations of looser monetary policies from the Federal Reserve. Additionally, the potential approval of US exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to invest in Ethereum could uplift the overall market mood. Furthermore, the interpretation of US political developments may shift over time. Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise, suggests that potential changes at the top of the Democratic ticket will likely settle in an improved position for cryptocurrencies. He emphasizes that Washington’s attitude towards digital assets has changed positively in the past year. Glassnode Predicts Retest Of Previous All-Time Highs Despite the negative price performance and uncertainty surrounding BTC’s price, Jan Happel and Yan Allemann, founders of blockchain analytics platform Glassnode, maintain their target for Bitcoin, stating that BTC is expected to reach the $110,000 area before the market peak. Notably, Allemann and Happel see the current consolidation as a retest of the previous all-time high area. However, for this to happen, Bitcoin will need to cross key levels at $64,000 and later $70,000, which will require further market development and price action. Related Reading: Solana Eases Gains: Can SOL Bulls Safeguard the $132 Support? According to Julio Moreno, the Metcalfe Price Valuation offers insights into the potential support level for Bitcoin’s price. Moreno suggests that $56,000 should be a crucial support level for Bitcoin based on this valuation. Moreno concluded that if the Bitcoin price fails to hold this key $56,000 level, the correction could potentially deepen, leading to more severe consequences for the market. BTC has regained the $57,300 level; however, the cryptocurrency has been down 5% in the past 24 hours, with no signs of near-term bullish catalysts to climb above $60,000.
