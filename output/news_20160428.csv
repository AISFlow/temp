42378685,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lLrj,1461881830,Vitalik Buterin Pitches Hyperledger Project on Ethereum Integration,"Ethereum inventor Vitalik Buterin addressed the Hyperledger technical steering committee earlier today, discussing the ways in which it might be able to integrate the Ethereum blockchain into its existing codebases, or replace them altogether.  Currently, Hyperledger’s primary proof-of-concept consists of elements of three different sets of code contributed by IBM and startups Blockstream and Digital Asset Holdings, and combined into what the group calls a “fabric”.  During Buterin's lengthy address to representatives from the group of technology and finance companies he covered everything from the security considerations of Ethereum to different kinds of accounts before culminating with “integration opportunities"".  Buterin told the group:  ""In general, there [are] a few paths forward.""  He broke down those paths into three possible directions, each of which depends on the degree to which the open-source Hyperledger project wants to embrace – or not embrace – Ethereum.  Three paths to Ethereum  First, Buterin suggested that the group of companies and startups could continue to use that fabric’s account model while running the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) as an option for computation.  ""Keep the way that you’re doing things exactly the way that your’re doing them right now with regards to the account model,” said Buterin. “Give people multiple ways to enter into agreements.""  Buterin only briefly touched on the second way he said Hyperledger could work with Ethereum. In theory, he said Hyperledger could integrate both Ethereum's account model of smart contracts and the Ethereum Virtual Machine, a distributed computational computer.  Lastly, Buterin said Hyperledger could integrate with Ethereum through the development of a wholly new account model that starts with elements of the Ethereum Virtual Machine and tailors it to suit their needs.  ""Try to come up with some type of architecture that essentially satisfies all the pain properties and abilities for the contracts to call each other,"" he said.  Possible next steps  Buterin said that Hyperledger's goals were new to him and that he would need more information about their objectives before going into any more detail about a possible integration.  Buterin told the group:  ""This is probably the area where I know a bit less about and if you want to go more deeply into this, with more follow up calls, I’d need more information specifically about the kinds of things about how the Hyperledger architecture works at this point.""  The technical steering committee he addressed is one of the major governing bodies of the open-source project, overseen by the nonprofit Linux Foundation. In February, the Linux Foundation announced the inaugural 30 members of its effort to build a cross-industry blockchain, adding ten more members later that month.  Buterin's appearance during this week's Hyperledger technical steering committee meeting comes after months for growing momentum for the project.  In March, Hyperledger member JPMorgan Chase announced its own Juno ""distributed cryptoledger"", marking an early presentation from one of the project's major corporate members.  Then, the following month Intel unveiled the so-called Sawtooth Lake distributed ledger platform, described as ""a highly modular platform for building, deploying and running distributed ledgers"".  Next week Hyperledger plans to host its second face-to-face meeting at the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation's offices in New Jersey. Multiple members of the steering committee expressed interest in working with Ethereum during that event, and Buterin was invited to take part.

42378692,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lLzH,1461869206,Thomson Reuters Exec Believes There Will Be 'Thousands' of Blockchain Uses,"In the past six months, mass media giant Thomson Reuters, perhaps best known for the Reuters international news agency, has made two significant moves in the blockchain sector.  More publicly known is news in late March that the firm had begun contributing to the Hyperledger project, an open-source blockchain initiative led by the Linux Foundation. The project boasts support from high-profile technology and financial firms as well as a number of blockchain-focused startups, and has attracted significant attention for its bid to bring the tech to big businesses.  Less publicized was its investment in Fluent, a startup looking to use permissioned blockchains for supply chain applications. The move was a strategic one, the company said at the time, indicating that it saw possible applications for the firm's technology across its global string of business units.  Among those units, Scott Manuel, vice president and head of product management for Thomson Reuters says, are the company’s tax accounting and legal research businesses.  Manuel said that while the company's financial data delivery and trading product divisions are looking at applications in line with major financial institutions, particularly exchanges and clearing houses, it’s on the legal side that the firm is seeing significant interest in blockchain.  He told CoinDesk:  ""Our legal customers ... are very excited about the potential of smart contracts, what can smart contracts do, what can they allow in the blockchain world. As most of our legal customers also do legal work with financial services, those clients are all interested in how blockchain can apply.""  Global applications  Manuel, whose background lies in computer science, says he remembers reading a 2011 New Yorker article that offered an early take on the pseudonymous creator of bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto. It was an experience that he says was a factor as Thomson Reuters beginning a process of investing resources into investigating the technology, starting about two years ago.  Since then, he said, the company, which employs more than 50,000 people according to Forbes, has pursued an effort to see where blockchains could be applied to its business lines.  ""We’ve gone down a path of bringing in chairs to the table, along with our business units and product people, to take use cases and start building small internal proofs of concept around them,"" he explained.  According to Manuel, ""there seems to be thousands"" of potential use cases for the tech. These include in data delivery and digital identity, which he cited as being of particular interest to Thomson Reuters.  ""We have a very large [know-your-customer] business around individuals and institutions,"" he said. ""So how will digital identity apply here? We’re investigating that with engineers, doing some internal proofs-of-concept in that space, too.""  As to its investment in Fluent, Manuel pointed to bridging supply chains with blockchain as something of interest to the firm – an application that has already garnered recent interest among Hyperledger members, particularly in the area of drug manufacturing.  ""Supply chain is very interesting and that’s going to be a business that has a lot of disruption,"" he said.  Looking ahead  For now, Manuel says Thomson Reuters is looking to continue its support and involvement with Hyperledger, saying that the company isn't sure where it might have the most impact.  ""They're still storming and forming,"" he said. ""I don’t exactly know where we’ll ultimately play the biggest role, but I think we’re just going to have to let that develop over time.""  But at the same time, he indicated Thomson Reuters sees its involvement as a learning opportunity as well.  ""It’s in our philosophy of playing with code, and doing real things – and we can learn a lot from these other really smart players that are at the table,"" he said.  Manuel said that the company is continuing to work with startups in the space and hasn’t ruled out making further investments beyond its stake in Fluent. Ultimately, he went on to say, the company wants to investigate what kinds of products it can build and, in his words, ""get our hands dirty"".  He concluded:  ""At the end of the day, to make real progress and work closely with our customers and get real things done, that’s the focus.""  Scott Manuel is speaking at Consensus 2016 in New York. Join him at the Marriott Marquis from 2nd to 4th May. A full list of the event speakers can be found here.

42378677,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lLgP,1461865525,"Stock Transfer Firm, Blockchain Startup Partner to Build Securities Registry","Australian stock transfer company Computershare is working with a UK-based blockchain startup to create a securities registry using the technology.  The plan is to use Setl’s tech foundation to facilitate the exchange of title from securities buyer to seller, with Computershare aiming to attract clients and users to the platform as it takes shape.  The two companies announced the deal at an investor event in Sydney, according to a report by the Sydney Morning Herald. From the outset, Computershare and Setl will focused on applications in the Australian securities market, which is notable given past moves by the country’s major stock exchange to explore distributed ledger solutions.  Stuart Irving, chief executive of Computershare, told investors during the event that the technology – which some proponents have said could augment or outright replace elements of the securities trade sector – makes sense for the company.  He reportedly told investors:  ""We believe the commentary that blockchain is automatically 'bad for Computershare' is ill-informed and reflects incomplete analysis or competing vested interests. The focus should be on payments and trade settlement, not registry. The view that 'distributed ledger' technology means everyone will get a copy of a share register is naive.”  Under the deal, Setl will provide software solutions for the planned registries, while Computershare will lobby industry stakeholders to participate.  Setl made headlines late last year when the startup named a former Bank of England executive director as its chairman. Sir David Walker, appointed in mid-December, had previously served in leadership capacities for Barclays and Morgan Stanley.

42378675,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lLdt,1461854825,UK Government Awards £248k for Ethereum Prototype,"The UK government has awarded £248k to a startup that is building a cross-border payments tool using Ethereum.  Founded in 2007, Innovate UK is a nondepartmental public office dedicated to fostering innovation through grants and investments.  In interview, Tramonex co-founder and CEO Amine Berraoui said his company will use the money to further develop its cross-border blockchain tool. London-based Tramonex already offers cross-border money transfers across 45 different currencies.  Berraoui told CoinDesk:  ""We are quite advanced in our prototype already, it’s more about looking for different approaches to handle the technology. Then to develop the commercial clients.""  The award  will be dispersed to Tramonex on a quarterly basis, depending on the company's progress in achieving a set of agreed-upon benchmarks.  Once complete, the prototype will be submitted to the Financial Conduct Authority – a key finance regulator in the UK – and other as-yet-undisclosed regulators for approval.  Innovate UK did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Blockchain expansion  Tramonex, founded in 2013, is led by Berraoui, a former managing director for Deutsche Bank’s foreign exchange business, and Marc Avedissian, who previously worked for Goldman Sachs.  Currently, Tramonex is in the process of applying for an e-money license like the one obtained last month by bitcoin startup Circle. Berraoui said he expects the entire process to take about four months.  Berraoui added that the company is already in talks with potential clients on applications, but declined to name specific firms.  Tramonex expects its new blockchain prototype to cut the costs of transferring “significantly”, making its foreign exchange services more affordable to small and medium-sized businesses.  He also pointed to the firm's regulated status as a boon as it looks to develop blockchain solutions.  ""At the moment most bitcoin and cryptocurrency companies operate outside regulation so we wanted to use our experience as a regulated company to help other companies around Europe,"" he said.  It takes a village  The award by the UK government follows in the footsteps of other projects focused on borderless transactions that have emerged in Europe in recent years.  Since 1994, members of the European Economic Area have allowed what is called ""passporting"" of one another’s financial licenses for fellow EU members as well as Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. Last November, that infrastructure laid the foundation for Visa Europe to test its own remittance proof-of-concept for cross-border transactions using the bitcoin blockchain.  Even the £248k award to Tramonex comes as part of a larger effort. In April, UK Innovate committed to invest £561m over the next 12 months and to adopt a more focused approach to supporting UK-based companies.

42378684,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lLpD,1461848427,Russia's Sole Central Securities Depository Trials Blockchain Voting,"The National Settlement Depository (NSD), Russia’s sole central securities depository (CSD), has announced it has tested a blockchain-based voting system.  The de-facto securities system by law, the NSD provides settlement services for government bonds, municipal bonds and corporate bonds, accounting for 99% of domestic corporate bond issues. The announcement notably follows similar action in the US markets, with the DTCC revealing it is participating in trials and tests related to the emerging technology earlier this year.  According to a release, the NSD used the NXT blockchain system to create the open-source prototype, with the goal to enable shareholders to more easily vote as part of annual shareholder meetings.  ""E-Proxy Voting’s blockchain-based prototype registers the instructions directly in the distributed ledger, which is used by all chain participants at once,"" the release explains.  In statements, Sergei Putyatinski, IT director at the NSD, said that test have revealed the system can support 80 transactions, in this case data issuances representing votes, per second, but that the organization hopes to scale the system’s throughput to 300 instructions per second.  Putyatinski said:  “The next step is legal and cryptographic evaluations of the new prototype. Their findings will enable us to consider running actual voting.”  Since mid-2014  , Russian issues have been using electronic technologies and ISO standards to facilitate remote voting as part of a bid to make such processes more transparent and convenient.  The test further follows news that Nasdaq has launched a similar trial in Estonia designed to solve challenges related to participation in shareholder voting.

42378689,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lLwl,1461809452,Bitcoin Retreats Below $440 as Price Support Weakens,"Bitcoin prices dropped below $450 late yesterday and then continued to fall below $440 as of press time, breaking two key psychological levels in the span of hours.  Bitcoin dipped below $450 at 21:00 UTC on 27th April, reaching $449.89, CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) figures show. The digital currency quickly mounted a recovery, passing $450 at 22:00 UTC and rising to $450.80.  But, bitcoin failed to stay above $450 for long, falling to $449.89 at 22:30 UTC and dropping past $440 to reach $435.28 at 1:30 UTC. At the time of report, the digital currency was trading at $442.71.  Still, the currency’s plunge below $450 and $440 on 27th April and 28th April, respectively, contrasted sharply with the steady climb it enjoyed earlier this week, when bitcoin prices surpassed several key levels amid the latest progress toward overcoming the blockchain’s inherent capacity challenges.  Market observers suggested that $475 may be the next psychological barrier for traders, and that weak volume ahead of this level may have inhibited the price from continuing its upward momentum.  The retreat from $475 is notable given that bitcoin prices were on the cusp of reaching highs not seen since before 2015. According to BPI data, the price of bitcoin last hit $490 on 19th December, 2015, the only time it touched that figure for the year.  The price of bitcoin last exceeded $500 on 31st August, 2014.  Charles L. Bovaird II is a financial writer and consultant with strong knowledge of securities markets and investing concepts.
