36802685,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=654683,1732487408,XRP Analyst Sets $2 Target If It Holds Key Level – Can It Reach Multi-Year Highs?,"XRP has emerged as a standout leader in the recent crypto rally, delivering massive gains and fueling optimism among investors. The price has skyrocketed by an astonishing 225% in under three weeks, showing no signs of slowing down as momentum builds. This surge has positioned it as a top-performing altcoin, capturing the attention of analysts and traders alike. Related Reading: Avalanche Soars 20% In 24 Hours – Analyst Reveals Next Price Target CrediBull, a prominent analyst on X, has shared a detailed technical analysis highlighting XRP’s strong bullish structure. According to his insights, XRP is currently in a well-defined 5-wave impulsive move, a pattern often associated with sustained upward trends. If it continues to hold a critical support level, CrediBull predicts that the price could soar past $2 in the coming weeks, marking a significant milestone for the altcoin. As excitement grows, market participants are closely watching its performance. The ongoing rally suggests that XRP could hit new highs and pave the way for broader altcoin gains. Whether it can maintain its upward trajectory will depend on its ability to sustain key support levels and capitalize on the current bullish sentiment. For now, XRP remains a focal point in the market, with its next moves eagerly anticipated. The Bullish Rally Could Continue The recent bullish phase for XRP might be just the beginning as optimism continues to build among analysts who foresee a higher price in the months ahead. However, key price levels must be tested and maintained for XRP to sustain its momentum and advance to the next leg up. Prominent analyst CrediBull shared his insights on X, revealing that XRP is currently in a clear 5-wave impulsive move, a strong indicator of a bullish trend. According to his technical analysis, this pattern confirms that XRP’s absolute bottom was established at $0.49 earlier this year. He also emphasized the importance of the $1.05 level, the origin of the fifth subwave in this impulsive structure. CrediBull explained that if XRP falls below $1.05, it could signal the start of a larger Wave 2 correction, which would likely precede the next major upward impulse (Wave 3). However, if XRP holds firmly above $1.05, it would indicate that the fifth subwave is extending, potentially pushing the price to $2 or higher before any significant pullback occurs. Related Reading: Massive Ethereum Buying Spree – Taker Buy Volume hits $1.683B In One Hour This analysis reinforces the view that XRP’s current rally may just be the start of a broader bullish trend. Investors are now watching closely to see if XRP can maintain key support levels and confirm its extended move upward. XRP Hits Multi-Year Highs: ATH Next? XRP is trading at $1.45, following an impressive rally that saw the price touch $1.63 yesterday, marking its highest level since May 2021. This milestone has sparked optimism among investors, positioning XRP for a potential run to new all-time highs in the coming months. The sustained upward momentum reflects growing confidence in the price’s bullish trajectory. However, the recent surge also brings the possibility of consolidation. The price might need to cool off and gather strength below the $1.63 mark before continuing its upward movement. Consolidation phases are a natural part of any significant rally and can help establish stronger support levels for future price action.

If the price holds above this mark, it will reinforce its bullish outlook and set the stage for a potential breakout and continuation of its upward trend in the weeks ahead. Analysts believe that maintaining this level would be a strong signal of market confidence, paving the way for XRP to build on its recent gains and target new milestones.

36802657,https://coinpaprika.com/news/cantor-fitzgerald-joins-forces-with-tethe,1732487325,Cantor Fitzgerald Joins Forces with Tether,"Cantor Fitzgerald, a leading US financial services firm, has strengthened its partnership with Tether, the company behind the world's largest stablecoin, USDT . The collaboration includes a $600 million deal giving Cantor Fitzgerald a 5% stake in Tether, part of broader plans to expand into Bitcoin-backed lending. This partnership marks a strategic step for both firms. Tether has been aggressively expanding, minting $13 billion USDT since November 8, 2023. The latest $3 billion addition, reported on November 24, pushes USDT's total supply to $132 billion, reflecting rising demand for stablecoins. Stablecoins like USDT are essential for crypto traders, offering a reliable way to hedge market positions or conduct transactions without needing fiat currency. Cantor Fitzgerald’s involvement goes beyond ownership. Tether is set to play a key role in the firm's Bitcoin lending initiative, initially valued at $2 billion with plans for further growth. This program will offer loans backed by Bitcoin, potentially attracting significant institutional interest. Additionally, Cantor Fitzgerald reportedly manages a substantial portion of Tether's $134 billion reserves, primarily held in US Treasury bills. The partnership gains further significance as Cantor Fitzgerald’s CEO, Howard Lutnick, has been nominated as Secretary of Commerce under President-elect Donald Trump. This high-profile appointment could bolster Tether's regulatory standing in the US, despite the company facing allegations related to sanctions and anti-money laundering violations, which it has consistently denied. Lutnick has stated he will step down from his roles at Cantor Fitzgerald if confirmed by the Senate. Tether’s rapid minting aligns with a broader market rally, led by Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin and Solana. This resurgence reflects renewed investor confidence in the crypto market , with the increasing USDT supply contributing to market liquidity and price stability. Stablecoins like USDT are essential tools for maintaining balance in the volatile crypto ecosystem. Cantor Fitzgerald’s growing stake in Tether and its involvement in Bitcoin lending signal a deeper integration between traditional finance and digital assets . With Tether’s expanding influence and Cantor’s resources, this partnership could shape the future of crypto adoption and regulatory discussions.",POSITIVE,USDT,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | USDT,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/cantor-fitzgerald-joins-forces-with-tethe,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/36802657.jpeg

Not Happening, Claims Millionaire Analyst","Ripple’s XRP has traded below the $1 level for nearly three years, affected primarily by the cases filed by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Even during the mini bull run immediately after Donald Trump’s election, XRP had a sluggish price action, struggling to maintain its $0.57 price. But last November 16th, the altcoin hit the $1 price mark after surging by 14.72%. Related Reading: Chainlink Rockets 20%: Whale Activity Sparks Break From Bear Trend Fast-forward to one week and XRP is trading at $1.50, which briefly hit $1.62 last November 23rd. For many analysts, there’s no turning back for XRP’s price, with one popular Twitter/X user saying it will no longer drop below $1. In a post on Twitter/X last November 23rd, a millionaire mentor, a.k.a. the “Bearable Bull,” boldly predicted that the market would never see XRP “go below $1 again”. We Will Never See XRP Go Below $1 AGAIN — The Bearable Bull (@thebearablebull) November 23, 2024 $1 As XRP’s Base For Further Growth Ripple’s XRP started the year at $0.61 and traded for the next few months on the $0.50 to $0.60 level. And while Bitcoin and other altcoins started to rally immediately after Trump’s election, XRP’s price movement remained sluggish. Only a few days ago, XRP’s price began to move before breaking the $1 level on November 16th. The previous time Ripple’s XRP held the price was in December 2021, when it dipped to $1.96. For many market analysts, the $1 price now serves as the base for consolidation and further growth. XRP’s Price Will Not Look Back To $1 – Analyst XRP’s recent price rally has caught the attention of many analysts and market observers. The Bearable Bull, a popular crypto mentor on Twitter/X, is one of those analysts who offered bold insight into XRP’s price movement. In a Twitter/X post that garnered 94.7K views, Bearable Bull shared that the community will never see XRP revisit the $1 price. Other analysts shared his view, saying that the token has consolidated its base. Related Reading: Top Analyst Claims XRP New ATH Is Just Around The Corner – Details However, a few analysts offered some caution, saying it’s too early to tell if XRP will no longer dip below $1.

Even pro-Ripple lawyer John Deaton predicts that it will continue its bullish run, and he expects the coin to revisit its $100 billion market cap.

The financial company’s decision to invest with Tether portrays a vote of confidence in stability and operations, as the cryptocurrency stablecoin is under increased scrutiny from regulators worldwide. This deal comes at a time when Tether has become a banks’ persona non grata all over the world, making the continued support from Cantor Fitzgerald all the more important.

With millions of sport bettors getting ready to jump in the action, opportunities for early investors in XYZ are really huge! XYZ is currently undervalued, and with major listings on the way, presale participants stand to secure life-changing gains. >>>Don’t miss your shot at being part of the XYZ winning team! Ondo (ONDO) Ondo Finance is making waves by blending traditional finance's reliability with blockchain technology. By tokenizing stable, income-generating real-world assets like U.S. Treasuries, Ondo opens access to high-grade financial products for a broader audience. This approach democratizes investment opportunities once reserved for large institutions. Ondo's structure includes an asset management arm creating tokenized products and a technology arm developing decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, enhancing functionality and scalability of their offerings. In a volatile crypto market where trust is key, Ondo stands out by partnering with reputable institutions like BlackRock and using Coinbase for secure custody. Their emphasis on transparency and compliance sets them apart. Products like USDY, a stablecoin backed by U.S. Treasuries and bank deposits, offer stable yields with blockchain convenience. In the current market, where investors seek safer options amid uncertainty, Ondo's focus on regulated, transparent products makes it an intriguing choice. Compared to more volatile coins, Ondo provides a blend of stability and innovation that could appeal to both traditional and crypto investors looking for reliable growth. cat in the dogs world (MEW) In a crypto landscape filled with dog-themed coins, MEW emerges as the lone cat ready to shake things up. MEW is not just another meme coin; it's a symbol of change in a market crowded by dog coins. With its playful feline mascot, MEW aims to capture the hearts of crypto enthusiasts looking for something different. As the market cycles through highs and lows, MEW stands out with its unique approach. While dog coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have had their moments, MEW offers a fresh perspective. Its technology promises faster transactions and a more active community. In the current market, where investors seek new opportunities beyond the usual canine coins, MEW looks attractive. It could be the next big thing that adds diversity to the meme coin space. Pepe (PEPE) PEPE is a new memecoin that's making waves in the crypto community. Created as a tribute to the Pepe the Frog meme by Matt Furie, it launched on Ethereum with a deflationary model. Unlike other coins, PEPE has a no-tax policy and doesn't pretend to have utility. It's all about embracing the meme culture. In April and May 2023, PEPE's value skyrocketed, reaching a market cap of $1.6 billion. Early holders became millionaires overnight, and a passionate community formed around it. This surge sparked a ""memecoin season,"" with many new meme-based coins experiencing wild price swings. Looking at its potential, PEPE aims to join the ranks of top memecoins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. Its simple approach and transparent roadmap appeal to many. The plan includes getting listed on major exchanges and initiating a ""meme takeover."" In the current market, with excitement building for the next Bitcoin halving and a hoped-for bull run, PEPE could continue to grab attention. While it lacks the utility of some other cryptocurrencies, its strong community and viral nature might keep it in the spotlight. Time will tell if PEPE will reach new heights or if the hype will fade. TRON (TRX) TRON (TRX) is a blockchain platform launched in 2017 by the Tron Foundation. It aims to give full ownership rights back to digital content creators. Unlike traditional platforms like YouTube or Facebook, TRON allows creators to share their work directly with consumers. This means content makers can earn rewards without middlemen taking a big cut. Originally, TRX tokens were based on Ethereum, but they moved to their own network in 2018. TRON supports smart contracts and decentralized apps, known as dApps. Transactions are transparent and can be tracked on a public ledger. In today's market, TRON stands out by focusing on creators and decentralization. Its approach challenges big tech companies by removing intermediaries. Compared to other coins like Ethereum, TRON offers low transaction fees, which is a big plus for users. The ability to create and share content without worrying about fees makes TRON appealing. As the demand for decentralized apps grows, TRON could become more attractive. While the crypto market is always changing, TRON's focus on empowering creators gives it a unique position. It might be a coin to watch in this market cycle. Conclusion ONDO, MEW, PEPE, and TRX are promising, but XYZVerse uniquely blends sports and memes, aiming for massive growth in the 2024 bull run.

36798158,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=654668,1732476633,Notcoin (NOT) Gears Up For Major Rally – Is $0.12 Still Within Reach?,"Notcoin (NOT) has recently been in an impressive price form rising by 19.71% in the past day to reach a local peak of $0.0085. While the momentum on the Telegram-based cryptocurrency has cooled in the last few hours, popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez anticipates further price gains as shown by a recent bullish prediction. Related Reading: Notcoin Set For More Gains Following 13% Price Rally – Details Notcoin Preparing For Liftoff: Analyst In an X post on November 23, Martinez gave a reassuring bullish prediction on Notcoin following the token’s sideways movement after breaking out of a falling wedge two weeks ago. Traditionally, the falling wedge is a bullish pattern characterized by two downward trend lines converging as the price moves lower. When a descending wedge is observed after a downtrend, it signals a potential reversal to an uptrend but if this chart pattern forms during an uptrend, it indicates merely a pause before the price rise continues. Notcoin gained by over 380% following its launch in May, but soon slipped in a bearish market that stretched over the following five months. On November 9, Martinez stated the altcoin had broken out of a falling wedge pattern setting up a potential 76% price gain. However, Notcoin has remained in a range-bound market over the past two weeks oscillating between $0.0070 – $0.0084. Commenting on this development, Ali Martinez remains confident of his bullish prediction stating that the altcoin is only gathering the necessary momentum and liquidity to launch a price upswing. The analyst’s price target remains $0.12 which will represent the token’s highest price level since August if attained. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Telegram-Based Notcoin Is Ready To Fly, Here’s How High Major Resistance Awaits NOT Bullish Rally Amidst possibilities of a major price surge, investors should note that Notcoin will face a resistance zone at $0.010 which proved previously effective with a price rejection in October. However, Martinez’s positive projection remains highly possible considering the current robust bullish sentiments in the Notcoin market and general crypto community. The digital asset market has been on the green side following the election of pro-crypto candidate Donald Trump as US President. With the anticipation of a crypto-friendly administration, investors are likely to retain buying pressure in major cryptocurrencies including Notcoin. Moreover, Notcoin continues to secure strategic partnerships that can increase its adoption levels. These include its recent Telegram Gaming Accelerator launched in collaboration with Helika Gaming. At the time of writing, NOT trades at $0.0081 reflecting gains of 4.36% and 5.66% in the past seven and thirty days respectively. In addition, altcoin’s daily trading volume is up by 138.51% and valued at $362.69 million.

Anticipated to deliver exceptional returns, these five cryptocurrencies could be the game-changers investors have been waiting for. Delve into which tokens are expected to soar and how they might offer unprecedented growth opportunities soon. DOGEN: The Ultimate Memetoken for Real Alphas Who Always Win Imagine living a dream life — posh cars, fat stacks of cash, and women who turn heads. That’s the DOGEN lifestyle! If you’re the kind of guy who’s always looking to level up, you need to check out DOGEN. This meme token is for the real alphas who always win. 💎 HODL Like a Beast, Dominate the Market 💎 This thing is about to explode! We’re talking about a 700% surge before the presale even wraps up — and that’s just the beginning. DOGEN is heating up to those insane thousand-fold gains that memetokens are famous for this season. Get in early, and watch the others try to keep up while you’re already at the top! ⚡️ Missed Out on WIF, Popcat, or Ponke? ⚡️ DOGEN is the new alpha on the Solana blockchain, running with the big dogs like BONK, WIF, and Popcat — all of which blew up with 1000% gains at some point . Right now, DOGEN’s flying under the radar, but it’s about to set new records in this bull run. You don’t want to miss out on this one. Got that DOGEN spirit? Good, ‘cause they’re holding an airdrop! All you gotta do is flex on social, stack tokens during the presale, and start building your DOGEN army with your referral link. For every recruit, you’ll be snatching a fat 20% of their Golden Points from token buys. So what are you waiting for? Grab some DOGEN and dominate the crypto world! 🚀 Bitcoin: The Pioneering Cryptocurrency and Its Potential Bitcoin (BTC) is the first cryptocurrency, enabling decentralized peer-to-peer transactions without central authority. Introduced by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, it uses blockchain technology to operate as a distributed ledger, eliminating the need for intermediaries like banks. Transactions are validated through mining, where miners solve complex puzzles and are rewarded with bitcoins. The capped supply of 21 million bitcoins and events like the halving, which reduces miners' rewards every four years, contribute to its scarcity. Bitcoin's technology offers potential for secure, fraud-resistant financial transactions. Its attractiveness in the current market cycle depends on various factors, and individuals should consider their own research and risk tolerance when evaluating it. Ethereum's Journey: From Smart Contracts to Future Scalability Ethereum is a leading Proof-of-Stake blockchain known for its smart contracts and diverse decentralized applications. It introduced ERC-20 tokens, widely used for governance, utility, and value storage. In 2022, Ethereum transitioned to Proof-of-Stake with the Merge, enhancing efficiency. Upcoming developments like sharding aim to boost scalability and reduce costs. Price predictions suggest Ethereum could reach up to $6,580.53 next year, with a potential low of $2,700.31 in 2025. Considering its continuous advancements and robust ecosystem, Ethereum holds significant potential in the current market cycle. Solana (SOL): A Scalable Platform for Decentralized Applications Solana is a blockchain platform focused on scalability, offering a foundation for decentralized applications alongside platforms like Ethereum and Cardano. It achieves faster transactions without sharding or second-layer solutions, providing flexible development options across multiple programming languages. SOL, the native cryptocurrency of Solana, facilitates transactions, runs custom programs, and rewards network supporters. The coin underpins the Solana ecosystem, giving users access to a suite of projects. With its high-capacity network, Solana aims to attract developers and investors interested in hosting high-activity products and services. In the current market cycle, Solana's emphasis on performance continues to draw attention in the blockchain community. TRON (TRX): A Platform for Decentralized Content and dApps TRON (TRX) is a decentralized blockchain platform launched in 2017. It lets content creators own and share their work directly without intermediaries like YouTube or Facebook. TRX tokens, originally based on Ethereum, moved to their own network after a year. TRON supports smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps), enabling developers to build and share content openly. Transactions are recorded in a public ledger, similar to Bitcoin's model. The platform aims to create a decentralized Internet, offering tools for building dApps. Its ability to empower creators and facilitate direct rewards makes it notable in the blockchain space. In the current market cycle, TRON's focus on content decentralization positions it as an interesting project. Conclusion BTC, ETH, SOL, and TRX may offer less short-term potential. DOGEN stands out for those seeking luxury and success. Expected to grow 700% by the end of presale, it could yield thousand-fold returns this altcoin season. Following tokens like BONK, WIF, and Popcat, DOGEN builds a community of leaders, offering real benefits and exclusive perks for early adopters.

It allows people to make transactions without banks or central authorities. Satoshi Nakamoto created it to enable a decentralized electronic cash system. Unlike physical money, Bitcoin works as a shared ledger across many computers in the network. This removes the need for intermediaries. Transactions are verified through mining. Miners solve complex puzzles to confirm transactions and earn bitcoins as a reward. This process helps protect the system against fraud. Every so often, the Bitcoin network undergoes a ""halving,"" reducing miners' rewards by half. This affects mining profitability because only 21 million bitcoins will ever exist. Ethereum's Potential Shines Amidst Bullish Market Trends Ethereum is a Proof-of-Stake blockchain known for its smart contracts and a wide ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps). It supports decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms and Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Polygon, which improve transaction efficiency. Ethereum introduced ERC-20 tokens, used in various applications for governance, utility, and value storage, though transactions still require ETH for gas fees. Since its inception by Vitalik Buterin in 2013 and the network's launch in 2015, Ethereum has evolved, transitioning to Proof-of-Stake with the Merge in 2022. Ether (ETH) is central to the ecosystem, facilitating transactions, rewarding stakers, and serving as a tradable asset and collateral. XRP: A Fast, Low-Cost Cryptocurrency Powering Borderless Transactions XRP is a cryptocurrency supported by the XRP Ledger, designed for fast and low-cost transactions. It operates on a decentralized system without a central authority, making transactions secure and irreversible. With no need for a bank account, XRP enables open and borderless payments, resistant to censorship or counterfeiting. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP launched with an initial supply of 100 billion tokens. Ripple, which was gifted 80 billion XRP for development, uses it to improve network liquidity and support the ecosystem. The name XRP, derived from ""ripple credits,"" reflects its goal to facilitate seamless payment transfers across different currencies. BNB and Its Potential in the Crypto Ecosystem BNB is the cryptocurrency of Binance, launched in June 2017. It started as an ERC-20 token. Now, it works on the Binance Chain and Binance Smart Chain. BNB is used for paying fees, issuing tokens, and transferring assets. It supports smart contracts through Proof-of-Staked Authority consensus. Users can earn rewards by staking BNB. Beyond transactions, BNB offers fee discounts on Binance.com and is used by third-party services. The supply of BNB reduces every quarter through burns. The goal is to cut the initial supply from 200 million to half, enhancing its value. Conclusion While established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and Binance Coin remain influential, their short-term growth potential seems limited. In contrast, CYBRO stands out as a groundbreaking DeFi platform. It uses AI-powered yield aggregation on the Blast blockchain to help investors maximize earnings.

CYBRO, a standout among these, is drawing attention with forecasts suggesting it could grow by 15,000% before the year ends. This unexpected projection is stirring curiosity about what makes CYBRO so special in the rapidly evolving crypto landscape. CYBRO Presale Achieves $4 Million Milestone: A Unique Multichain DeFi Solution CYBRO is capturing the attention of crypto whales as its exclusive token presale quickly surges above $4 million. This multichain cutting-edge platform offers investors unparalleled opportunities to maximize their earnings across various blockchains in any market condition. Experts predict a potential ROI of 1200%, with CYBRO tokens available at a presale price of just $0.04 each. This rare, technologically advanced project has already attracted prominent crypto whales and influencers, indicating strong confidence and interest. In an exciting development, CYBRO has also launched a referral program, offering 12% from direct referees' token purchases, 3% from second-level referees, and 2% from third-level referees. Rewards are sent weekly in USDT, and referees earn double CYBRO Points on their first deposit using the referral code. In addition to tokens, CYBRO introduces exclusive Points, providing even greater benefits for investors. These Points grant automatic entry into the CYBRO Airdrop, where the number of tokens you receive is proportional to the Points you hold. Up to 1 million Points are distributed weekly, earned by investing in CYBRO’s DeFi Vaults. Holders of CYBRO tokens will enjoy lucrative staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, cashback on purchases, reduced trading and lending fees, and a robust insurance program within the platform. With only 21% of the total tokens available for this presale and approximately 100 million already sold, this is a golden opportunity for savvy investors to secure a stake in a project that's truly one in a million. >>>Join CYBRO and aim for future returns up to 1200% Render Token Unlocks Decentralized GPU Power for Creators Render Token (RENDER) powers The Render Network, offering decentralized GPU-based rendering solutions. It allows creators to access GPU power for rendering tasks more efficiently and at lower costs. Node operators share their spare GPU capacity and receive RENDER tokens for their services. This system supports the production of animation, motion graphics, and visual effects by using a distributed network of processing power. By connecting artists with available GPU resources, Render Token can make rendering tasks more accessible and affordable. Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) Aims to Transform the Internet Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) seeks to expand the internet's role from sharing information to becoming a global computing platform. Developed by the DFINITY Foundation, it aims to enable decentralized applications to run at web speed. ICP focuses on reducing computing costs and enhancing the internet's efficiency. Its goal is to create a decentralized web where software and digital services operate securely and autonomously, without relying on traditional cloud services or big tech companies. This approach could reshape the digital landscape, offering a more open, secure, and user-friendly internet experience. Fetch.AI: Connecting AI and Blockchain for Decentralized Solutions Fetch.AI is an artificial intelligence lab that started in 2017. It builds an open, permissionless network for decentralized machine learning with a crypto economy. Launched on Binance in 2019, Fetch.AI enables anyone to access AI technology securely. Users can connect and use autonomous AI agents to perform tasks using global data. The platform helps optimize DeFi trading, improve transportation networks like parking and micromobility, enhance smart energy grids, and streamline travel services. Fetch.AI aims to make complex digital systems that rely on large datasets more efficient and accessible. NEAR Protocol: A Scalable Platform for Decentralized Applications NEAR Protocol is a platform that helps developers build and launch decentralized applications. It uses sharding to improve efficiency and scalability. NEAR operates on a distributed network, like centralized data storage systems, but it's decentralized. Founded by Alex Skidanov and Illia Polosukhin, NEAR raised over $20 million from major venture firms. The platform features the Nightshade sharding solution for scalability. It also includes the Rainbow Bridge for Ethereum token transfers. Aurora, a Layer 2 solution, leverages Ethereum's technologies for better performance and lower fees. Conclusion As the crypto market continues its bullish trend into 2024, investors are turning towards AI-driven tokens. Coins like RENDER, ICP, FET, and NEAR show promise but may offer less short-term potential. In contrast, CYBRO stands out as a significant opportunity. This advanced DeFi platform utilizes AI-powered yield aggregation on the Blast blockchain to maximize earnings. With features such as lucrative staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, and cashback on purchases, CYBRO provides a superior user experience with seamless deposits and withdrawals. Its focus on transparency, compliance, and quality has attracted strong interest from major crypto investors and influencers. CYBRO appears poised for substantial growth by year-end, offering unparalleled opportunities in the evolving crypto landscape.

36795874,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=654678,1732471220,Bullish Signs For Cardano: Expert Forecasts $6 Price Target As Buying Pressure Grows,"Cardano (ADA), currently ranked as the ninth-largest cryptocurrency, has emerged as one of the market’s top performers. It has experienced an impressive 108% increase over the past two weeks, propelled its price to a 32-month high, fueled by a wave of bullish sentiment following Donald Trump’s presidential victory on November 5. Potential For Cardano To Reach New All-Time Highs Crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently highlighted ADA’s massive performance in a post on X (formerly Twitter), noting that the cryptocurrency has surged nearly 200% in the last three weeks. Despite this significant increase, Martinez suggests that even greater gains may be on the horizon. In his analysis, Martinez pointed out that whales and institutional investors strategically positioned themselves for future price movements. He reported that the volume of large transactions on the Cardano network has surpassed $22 billion daily, indicating a high accumulation level among significant holders. Notably, whales—individuals or entities holding between $1 million and $10 million in ADA—have increased their positions by over 100% in the past month, signaling confidence in Cardano’s potential. Related Reading: XRP Price Outlook Brightens: Expert Predicts $2 Target Post-Gensler Era Martinez further elaborated on ADA’s price action, suggesting that the ongoing buying pressure mirrors patterns observed in previous bullish cycles. He posits that if this trend continues, Cardano’s price could target the $6 mark, which would nearly double its all-time high of $3.09 reached during the 2021 bull run. Such a price increase would represent a staggering 461% surge from its current levels. Yet, for this bullish thesis to hold, Martinez emphasizes the importance of $0.80 support. The analyst notes that approximately 48,000 ADA addresses purchased nearly 1.20 billion coins at this price point, which may provide a solid foundation for future growth. Previously, Martinez predicted that if history repeats itself, the Cardano price could see a market top by September 2025, suggesting 10 months of what could be one of the biggest gains not only for ADA but for the broader crypto market. ADA Price Targets $1.25 Resistance Level Further supporting Martinez’s bullish predictions, other analysts have weighed in on Cardano’s (ADA) recent performance. Rekt Capital has noted a “phenomenal run” for ADA, indicating that the cryptocurrency has confirmed a new macro uptrend. Rekt highlighted that the last time ADA broke through the $0.72 level, the price subsequently rallied to its $3 record peak, suggesting a similar potential for future growth. Related Reading: Ethereum Attempts Key Breakout: Analysts Set Next Target As ETH Reclaims $3,200 Another analyst, known as Sssebi, shared his insights predicting that once ADA surpasses the $1.60 mark, it could experience a swift ascent to $2.40. He emphasized that this upward momentum would set the stage for an all-time high to be within reach. However, the analyst also cautioned that the next resistance area to watch is at $1.25, indicating that while the outlook is optimistic, a retracement could occur in the near term. At the time of writing, ADA was trading at $1.07, down 1% for the 24-hour period.

BTC came within reach of $100,000, while major altcoins such as Stellar (XLM), Polkadot (DOT), Ripple (XRP), and Cardano (ADA) registered massive gains. Let’s explore which altcoins to buy while the market presents the opportunity. Stellar (XLM) The Stellar network is similar to the Ripple (XRP) network - a decentralised payment platform and cryptocurrency that facilitates quick and low-cost cross-border payments, promoting financial inclusion for individuals and businesses globally. The Stellar network was created to support digital representations of any currency but has its native token called Lumens (XLM). Developed as a fork of the Ripple protocol, Stellar aims to create a global network connecting financial institutions, payment processors, and individual users, making cross-border money transfer easier and providing access to essential financial services. Stellar’s XLM gained over 140% over the past week, peaking at $0.63 before pulling back. At the time of writing, XLM traded at $0.47. Down 52% from its ATH of $0.93, now would be an excellent time to get your hands on XLM before the next bull run disrupts the market. Polkadot (DOT) Polkadot (DOT) witnessed an exceptional surge, gaining over 100% in the past month and 55% over the past week. DOT, the 15th largest crypto by market cap, struggled to make gains over the past while trading as low as $3.69 early in November. Since Donald Trump’s victory in the US Election, DOT has slowly been gaining ground, gaining over 52% this past week and 103% in the past month. DOT also reported an increase in its daily trading volume, and its price peaked at $10.29 earlier today. Polkadot’s (DOT) rally cements its position in crypto and proves why it should not be disregarded despite its recent troubles. DOT’s ATH is $55, meaning the potential profit to be made from this project is still enormous. The market pullback paves the way for investors to secure their stake in Polkadot. First Convicted Raccon Fred (FRED) Yes, you read that correctly. With the misspelling of “Racoon” in tow, FRED, like his buddy Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT), had several unbelievable daily gains in the past month. FRED and Peanut lived in the same house and were both seized and euthanized by New York state authorities over rabies concerns. The news of the passing of these beloved pets drew significant attention and quickly became viral sensations, with Elon Musk making multiple posts about Peanut on Twitter. While not as big of a sensation as PNUT, FRED made a 383% leap in the space of a day. Pet-focused memecoins have become a crypto goldmine with their ability to capture the hearts of traders and investors with the uncanny light-heartedness they bring to the often brutal crypto world. These memecoins are quickly becoming more popular, and the altcoin market may soon be likened to a digital zoo. That brings us to our next subject: Husky Inu (HINU). Husky Inu (HINU) Husky Inu (HINU) is the latest Solana-based dog-themed memecoin to grace the market. Husky Inu was created to bring its holders more value and utility by leveraging this robust blockchain. The project and its native token, HINU , want to make their mark on the saturated memecoin market by building a supportive community with innovative features and enhanced rewards. Husky Inu recently launched the presale for HINU, and the fundraising has attracted a fair amount of attention. Since going live, the presale has generated over $567,000 and will soon reach its fundraising target. Husky Inu’s presale success is powered by its unique qualities and future plans, aiming to its own Earn App and Decentralized Exchange. The Earn App will reward users with HINU tokens for engaging with the projects and completing minor tasks such as liking, reposting, and sharing content. Husky Inu’s Decentralized Exchange will facilitate decentralized trading and, in doing so, will improve the utility and value of HINU for its holders. The HINU presale is very close to reaching its fundraising target, meaning the time left to get in on this project is limited. Hurry now before you miss your chance on the next Shiba Inu (SHIB) or Dogecoin (DOGE).

Not to be outdone, another stablecoin company, Paxos , had its own news to share earlier this week. Paxos announced that it acquired Membrane Finance, also for an undisclosed amount. The purchase sets Paxos up to be a regulated entity in the EU , where it plans to issue MiCA -compliant stablecoins. Membrane is a Finnish company with an Electronic Money Institution (EMI) license.

36812803,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=102248,1732466295,Expert Shares 10 Factors that Can Take XRP to $10,"A market commentator recently highlighted ten reasons he believes XRP could be on its way to the ambitious $10 mark. Edoardo Farina, CEO of Alpha Lions Academy and Head of Social Adoption at XRPHealthcare, presented arguments supporting the audacious price goal days after XRP reclaimed the $1 level. The recent uptrend has reignited bullish sentiments around the altcoin.XRP, which has maintained its position above $1, would require an 809% increase to hit $10. Despite the massive growth necessary for this target, Farina believes it is feasible but speculative, citing ten factors that could catalyze it.SEC Lawsuit Resolution and Regulatory ClarityOne reason for Farina’s bullish stance on XRP is the anticipated conclusion of its prolonged legal battle with the U.S. SEC. Although the SEC has taken the case to appeal, speculations suggest a settlement could occur once a more pro-crypto candidate replaces Gary Gensler as SEC Chair.Notably, the Donald Trump transition team is already considering crypto-friendly individuals such as Teresa Guillen . Farina believes if the lawsuit ends, it could release suppressed market potential for XRP, leading to price growth. Moreover, his second reason is that XRP now holds a unique position as the only cryptocurrency with regulatory clarity in the U.S., paving the way for broader institutional adoption. Recall that Judge Analisa Torres ruled last July that XRP is not a security.Ripple’s RLUSD Stablecoin For his third reason, Farina highlighted the XRP Ledger’s role in supporting the issuance of Ripple’s native stablecoin, RLUSD. Ripple has confirmed that it will launch the stablecoin on the XRPL and Ethereum. Notably, the stablecoin is operationally ready , with Ripple now awaiting regulatory clearance before launch. The firm has confirmed that RLUSD will complement XRP.Pro-Crypto Policies and Gensler’s Resignation As pro-crypto Donald Trump looks to assume office in January 2025, Farina believes this is the fourth factor that could help XRP’s prospects. Farina drew attention to past interactions between Ripple executives and influential policymakers, suggesting a favorable regulatory environment under pro-crypto leadership. This optimism extends to the potential resignation of current SEC Chair Gary Gensler. For his fifth reason, Farina suggests that if Trump fires Gensler or he resigns , the introduction of a pro-crypto SEC Chairperson could bolster XRP’s chances of reaching $10. XRPL Technological Superiority Farina describes XRP as a technological marvel, noting that this is the sixth reason he believes it could reach $10. He dubbed XRP “Bitcoin 2.0,” suggesting it is an updated and better version of Bitcoin.Its ability to settle transactions in under three seconds at negligible fees sets it apart from competitors like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. This makes XRP a contender for real-world financial applications, which could boost its chances of hitting $10.The Ripple Effect of ETFsFarina pointed to the potential launch of XRP ETFs as the seventh factor that could help XRP hit $10. He expects a surge in XRP ETFs by 2025 from growing institutional interest. Notably, asset managers Bitwise , Canary Capital , and 21Shares have already filed to launch XRP ETFs. Grayscale is also looking to convert its multi-asset fund, which contains XRP, to an ETF. This institutional FOMO could lead financial entities to add XRP to their portfolios.Ripple IPO and Global Financial Integration Farina highlighted Ripple’s anticipated initial public offering (IPO) as the eighth reason. Public listing could boost Ripple’s visibility, drawing more investors into the XRP ecosystem. While Ripple CEO previously dismissed the idea of a US IPO, the emergence of the Trump administration could change this course.Meanwhile, for the ninth reason, Farina noted that Ripple’s goal to replace traditional Nostro-Vostro accounts could present XRP as a global reserve currency. Central banks adopting XRP for their reserves would reduce circulating supply, driving up demand.Potential Collaboration with Elon Musk’s X Farina speculates on a potential partnership between Ripple and Elon Musk ’s X platform as the tenth factor that could help XRP reach $10. Musk's vision to transform X into a payments hub syncs with XRP’s capabilities for fast and low-cost cross-border transactions. If XRP integrates into X’s ecosystem, it could revolutionize creator payouts and propel the asset’s price overnight. However, such a partnership remains highly speculative as of press time.",POSITIVE,XRP,BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/24/expert-shares-10-factors-that-can-take-xrp-to-10/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=expert-shares-10-factors-that-can-take-xrp-to-10,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

The Ethereum layer-2 token hovers above $2.20 with investors strongly bullish on future price gains. However, certain trading indicators signal otherwise. Related Reading: Optimism: Major Partnership Pushes OP Price By 24% Optimism Likely To Fall By 18% In a November 23 post on X, renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared a bearish prediction on Optimism despite the token’s current upward trend. According to Martinez, the TD Sequential has flashed a sell signal on OP’s 4-hour trading chart, presenting the potential for an imminent price dip. In trading markets, the Tom Demark (TD) Sequential indicator is commonly used to identify potential price exhaustion or continuations by analyzing patterns within price bars. After OP’s rally in the past week, the TD sequential now points to a trend exhaustion, suggesting a possible price reversal. Following this signal development, Martinez predicts OP could slide to $2.0. However, further correction could force the token’s price to around $1.80 indicating a potential 18% decline from the current market price. Martinez’s price projection is further backed by OP’s Relative Strength Index, an indicator that measures the speed and magnitude of an asset’s price movement to determine if it is overbought or oversold. According to data from OP’s 4-hour trading chart, the token’s RSI valued at 65.18 and descending from the overbought zone indicates buying pressure is weakening and a potential price correction is imminent. However, Optimism remains well above its 100-day simple moving average (SMA) which suggests a possible uptrend continuation. This factor, combined with the present strong bullish sentiments in the altcoin market suggests OP may maintain its current price rally, reaching as high as $2.5 at which lies its next significant market resistance.

On larger time frames, OP is significantly impressive notching gains of 35.76% in seven days as earlier stated, and 33.77% in the past 30 days. Despite recent gains, the Ethereum-layer 2 token remains 54.65% away from its all-time high of $4.85. However, OP remains an investor favorite considering its status in the Ethereum ecosystem.

One of the most significant developments was that of Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler announcing he would be stepping down in January when Trump takes office. Another development was Bitcoin miner MARA Holdings announcing it had purchased 5771 BTC for $572 million. Let’s look at some of the other big developments from the week gone by. Bitcoin Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler has confirmed he will be stepping down in January. The crypto market rallied in response to the news of Gensler’s impending departure, with Ripple (XRP) registering a dramatic increase and BTC nearing the $100,000 mark. MicroStrategy co-founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor is set to pitch a Bitcoin investment strategy to Microsoft’s board of directors. The proposal positions BTC as a treasury asset and comes amid growing support for the asset and its potential to enhance corporate balance sheets. Altcoins The Dogecoin (DOGE) rally has amplified interest in Shiba Inu (SHIB) , another popular meme token. The popularity of both meme tokens has significantly increased thanks to prevailing market conditions and bullish sentiment. Bitcoin (BTC) is on the verge of conquering the $100,000 price level. However, its market dominance has registered a marginal decline, with prominent altcoins stepping in and making double-digit gains. A Singaporean man is facing charges in the United States after allegedly laundering $230 million in cryptocurrency. Lam and an accomplice are accused of executing one of the biggest crypto thefts by an individual in US history. Bitcoin (BTC) is on the verge of reaching the coveted $100,000 level. As the asset nears this crucial level, altcoins are fighting for position and are ready, waiting for BTC to settle and go sideways before rallying. The meme coin market has seen a spurt in activity as investors flock to smaller projects, hoping to find crypto’s next unicorn. Bonk (BONK) is proving to be a viable option after it put together a stellar run to reach a new all-time high and become the fourth-largest meme coin by market cap. NEAR Protocol (NEAR), Cosmos (ATOM), and Polkadot (DOT) are presenting high-conviction setups deeply rooted in Wyckoff accumulation principles, showing explosive bull market potential. The Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) appeal against Ripple (XRP) has spooked investors and put XRP whales on edge as fears mount of potential regulatory upheavals that could impact the stability of their holdings. With a potential Republican supermajority in the United States, a strategic Bitcoin reserve could become a real possibility. However, Dogecoin co-founder Billy Markus suggested creating a strategic Dogecoin reserve after changing its source code to tackle the unlimited token supply. Business Charles Schwab Corp’s incoming CEO Rick Wurster has revealed the firm plans to offer spot crypto trading once US regulations make it easy to do so. Wurster expressed optimism about regulations under Donald Trump, adding the firm will be ready for any changes in the regulatory landscape. Bitcoin miner MARA Holdings has announced the purchase of an additional 5771 BTC for $572 million. The firm’s latest acquisition takes its BTC holdings to 33,875 BTC, valued at $3.4 billion at current prices. Web3 Web3 gaming studio Drift Zone has secured a $190,000 grant from the SEI Network to integrate its ecosystem on the blockchain.

Cardano recently surging 30% MoM to a new yearly high above $1 has raised hopes for a new Cardano ATH. Bullish Polygon price prediction has also stunned market analysts. Will the duo defy the odds and break into uncharted territory? Is thereanother innovative contender for the DeFi frontier? Let's find out. Cardano price prediction: 30% MoM rally boosts sentiment. Can we see another Cardano ATH? For weeks, Cardano has been riding the wave of bullish sentiment, with its price blowing through multiple resistance levels to register another yearly high above $1—the first time since 2022. The 30% MoM surge came at the right time, and now, analysts are predicting another Cardano ATH. Onchain metrics couldn't get any better. A 34% surge in Open Interest to $972M and whales doubling their ADA holding have raised confidence. Recent ecosystem developments, including L2 development and regulatory-friendly partnerships, have even fueled more optimism. Technical analysts have identified $6–$15 as long-term targets. Polygon price prediction: POL surge 53%, Is this the start of a comeback? Polygon price prediction has also been quite exhilarating. Recent bullish momentum has set POLblazing hot—a 53% MoM surge to a new quarterly high at $0.53, and analysts believe this might just be the beginning of its comeback. The bullish Polygon price prediction is a product of the unrelenting development the L2 network is experiencing. Recent developments, like its partnership with Magic Labs to launch the Newton L2 ZK solution and zkEVM Type 2 upgrade, have revitalized developer interest. Analysts predict POL could reach $0.45 by the end of 2024 and potentially $0.63 by 2025—an impressive 71% increase. Longer-term forecasts suggest a meteoric rise to $12.15 by 2030. Can Lunex Network toe in the same line? Since its launch, Lunex has been setting a new benchmark for DeFi ingenuity. This innovative AMM cross-chain DEX and its exploit-proof smart contract foundation are redefining asset exchange. The aim is to ensure absolute transparency and eliminate hidden costs, significantly reducing risks like front-running and market manipulation. The result is a secure and fair trading environment that appeals to all investors. Unlike traditional crypto exchanges, Lunex Network introduces comprehensive multi-asset DeFi tools and products. But the important feature that got many hooked on its presale was the chance to earn big for doing absolutely nothing! The revenue share program and staking opportunities promise huge ROIs and community engagement. Over 10% of the presale hard cap has been realized in mere weeks, and the presale is still blazing hot for just $0.0031 - a 158% gain that surpasses POL and ADA's performance. Conclusion As December unfolds, the stage is set for groundbreaking developments in the DeFi space, with Cardano and Polygon leading the charge. Yet, amidst the spotlight on these DeFi giants, LunexNetwork is carving out its path to prominence. Will December mark the dawn of new ATHs for ADA and POL, or will the Lunex Network emerge as the dark horse of DeFi? One thing is certain—this is a pivotal moment for the crypto market, with opportunities abound for those bold enough to seize them.

However, many experts still think this important milestone is attainable, and it could trigger a rippling effect that sends altcoins to a major bull run. Among these contenders, Lunex Network stands out as a rising star, poised to capitalize on the renewed momentum in DeFi and Web3 innovation. In fact, its ongoing presale is leading to a market resurgence as it draws in more than $3M in liquidity and significant attention from investors. Read on to learn more. Ethereum price stalls below $4k, but analysts predicted a December bull run Ethereum is the most highly revered DeFi innovator, but its slow momentum is raising some doubts. Just recently, BTC went to the brink of a six-figure value, and Solana broke ATH. However, Ethereum is still stuck below $4k—a level it hasn’t breached since early 2022. Investors are growing restless, asking why Ethereum price is lagging, and whether December could finally deliver the breakthrough. Once the undisputed leader in smart contract technology, Ethereum has seen its dominance challenged. Competitors like Solana have surged ahead. Unfortunately, the network’s high gas fees and congestion remain persistent issues. Yet, analysts believe December could be the turning point for Ethereum. Historically, the final month of the year often sees a surge in crypto prices. The renewed investor enthusiasm and capital rotation can see ETH rise, too. Upcoming developments could be the catalyst that pushes Ethereum back to the precipice of DeFi innovation. As of press time,Ethereum price is hovering around $3,300 with a modest 30% surge MoM. Lunex Network dominates presale, Can a $4k Ethereum pricetrigger more runs? Lunex Network is riding the wave of Ethereum price’s optimism to dominate its presale. This revolutionary Ethereum-based decentralized exchange is capturing attention with its innovative cross-chain technology, user-friendly design, and privacy-focused design. Lunex promises to eliminate the barriers of traditional exchanges by offering seamless interoperability across 40+ blockchains and 50,000+ trading pairs. With Lunex, it's one for all. Beginners get an inclusive, user-friendly and supportive trading environment. Businesses get a first-in-class e-commerce-friendly API solution, and savvy traders benefit from advanced trading APIs, tools and products. The platform’s standout revenue-sharing model is particularly appealing. By allocating 18% of its profits to LNEX token holders, Lunex offers a unique blend of passive income and long-term growth potential. Currently in presale, Lunex tokens are available for just $0.0031. If Ethereum’s potential breakout above $4,000 sparks a broader market rally, Lunex Network’s innovative features and investor-friendly ecosystem could make it one of the standout winners of this bull run. Conclusion Ethereum price has always been the catalyst for altcoin bull runs. While Ethereum's long-anticipated breakthrough could redefine its dominance in the DeFi space, it also opens the door for innovative projects like Lunex Network to shine this bull run. If Ethereum surpasses $4,000, the ripple effects could not only elevate established altcoins but also propel trailblazers like Lunex to unprecedented heights. With its presale already a massive success and analysts projecting significant growth, Lunex Network is more than just a contender—it’s a glimpse into the future of DeFi.

We highlighted Lutnick’s remarks on bitcoin in a September edition of the Forward Guidance newsletter. At the time, the CEO noted that traditional finance players — including banks and brokerages — would “go headfirst into bitcoin” when the regulatory environment improved. Trump’s election win has seemed to set the stage for that, given the crypto promises he has made (namely, “firing” Securities and Exchange Chair Gary Gensler). Read more: Trump nominates pro-crypto CEO to lead commerce department Lutnick said in a September X video that bitcoin adoption will proliferate once banks can more freely clear, custody and transact in bitcoin — a reality hindered by the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121 . Lutnick’s firm has stablecoin issuer Tether as a client — a company that has denied being under federal investigation . Speaking of Trump appointments, reports surfaced this week of him potentially selecting a crypto czar and forming a crypto council that could be housed under the White House’s National Economic Council. Still, Blockchain Association CEO Kristin Smith said she is watching out for who could fill two other roles. We’ll have lots of time to debate who would be best for positions like a “crypto czar.” It’s a great idea, but the ones before us are Treasury Secretary and SEC Chair–a crypto czar won’t be able to get much done unless the people in those posts are strong.

Absolutely Yes,"Summary Bitcoin's recent surge is extraordinary, nearing $100k, and technical indicators suggest we are at the beginning of a bullish cycle, not the end. Short-term support is at the 20-day EMA around $90k, while long-term support is at the 20-week EMA, currently $70k and rising. Fundamental factors, including bullish sentiment around the US presidential election and significant buying from HODLers, are driving demand higher against limited supply. Despite new highs, Bitcoin remains a strong buy, with potential to reach $150k-$200k by 2025, making current prices look like a bargain. The run we’ve seen in Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) has been quite extraordinary. The OG alt-coin broke out after the presidential election in the US and hasn’t looked back, now exploding higher to make new all-time price highs. This weekend, the price is inches away from $100k, which seems inevitable at this point. However you feel about presidential election, it’s a potential factor for the bulls going forward. In addition, while Bitcoin looks expensive given the sharpness of the move we’ve seen, I actually think we’re much closer to the beginning of this move than the end. As a result, I remain extremely bullish on Bitcoin. Let’s dig in. Technicals support higher prices Given Bitcoin isn’t a business (ie: it doesn’t have revenue/earnings/book value), for me the primary way to look at prospects is via the technicals. Anyone that’s read my work knows I like this approach anyway, but it’s especially important for assets like Bitcoin, gold, or anything else where “value” is in the eye of the beholder. With that in mind, let’s start with the daily chart. StockCharts We can see the explosion higher that has happened in the past couple of weeks and it has indeed extended the momentum indicators. There’s nothing more bullish than a price breakout that’s followed by huge buying, which is exactly what we have here. I have the PPO, accumulation/distribution line, and the Chaikin Money Flow indicator in the bottom three panels, and all three look tremendously bullish. Is it overbought? Yep, it definitely is, but I also don’t think this is a bad thing. Below, I’ll show why I think this is a good thing. For now in the short-term, I’d look for support on pullbacks at the 20-day exponential moving average, currently just under $90k. If we get anywhere near that level, it’s a strong entry point. Let’s go longer-term now and look at a weekly chart that goes back to 2020. We can see the breakout to new highs that cleared (quite easily) the highs from 2021 and just kept going. StockCharts For anyone that thinks Bitcoin is overextended, I’d invite you to look at the PPO on the weekly chart. We had a “reset” to the centerline just before this most recent move higher, and it’s nowhere close to being overbought. The CMF is showing strong bullishness as well, so on the weekly chart, all looks well to me. On the worst pullback I can think of going forward, look for support at the 20-week EMA, which is currently $70k but rising quite quickly. I’d be surprised anytime soon to see something close to that value, but as we get into 2025 and that 20-week EMA rises sharply, it could come into play. So, if I’m right and the OG isn’t overbought, what kind of move could we be looking at? Prior bull cycles are quite instructive, so let’s take a look. StockCharts This is the same price chart as above but with different indicators at the bottom. Let’s start with the 52-week rate of change in the middle panel, which just shows how much Bitcoin has moved over the prior 52 weeks. Right now, that number is 161%. That’s a lot, but during prior cycles, we’ve seen much more than that. I’m not suggesting we’ll see a 52-week ROC of 1,000% again, but my point is we can easily see much more than 161%. More importantly, the 14-week RSI has been quite good at calling the start of bull runs. Since 2020, we’ve seen the 14-week RSI go above 70 three times: late-2020, late-2023, and right now. In the 2020 version, it portended a further 400% gain. In 2023, it was just in front of a further 111%. Will this time be different? I doubt it, and it means that I’d be very surprised if this move doesn’t end with Bitcoin going to at least $150k, but probably more than that. Unless something changes materially with Bitcoin (a negative news item or something like that), I’m looking at something from $150k to $200k before we get another big move down. There are a lot of variables between now and then, but I have little doubt we’re much closer to the beginning of this bull cycle than the end based on the above. Fundamental positives On a fundamental basis, part of the reason Bitcoin is rallying right now is because there’s bullishness around the US presidential election, with speculation around a US strategic Bitcoin reserve , more lax regulation, potential investment in mining, etc. Point being, investors are putting their money where their proverbial mouth is on the idea that the president-elect is going to help drive demand for Bitcoin higher, whatever the method. We’ll see if that actually comes to fruition, but if you’re a Bitcoin bull, this is likely music to your ears. More tangibly, the frenzied buying from the likes of Bitcoin HODLers like MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) and Marathon Digital ( MARA ) is soaking up enormous amounts of supply in Bitcoin. What happens when there’s more demand for an asset than supply? I think you know the answer to that. Let’s look at how many Bitcoin are mined per day to get an idea of how many Bitcoin are entering the fray each day. Below, we have blocks mined per day, and given there are 6.25 coins per block, we take the value of ~150, and 6.25X that is about 937 Bitcoin per day. It changes slightly each day, but as a guide we can use that figure. Bitbo If we take this figure and annualize it, we’re at ~342k coins. MSTR alone owns a full year of supply right now, and just since the end of October, has raised enough money to buy another 60k or 70k coins (or ~two months of supply), depending upon purchase price. Other smaller players like Marathon are buying coins as quickly as they can now as well, seeing the success MSTR has achieved. Point being, the rate of purchase of just HODLers like MSTR is soaking up a bunch of supply of Bitcoin, we have others like miners holding their coins – rather than selling them to fund operations – and you have a recipe where there’s very little supply hitting the market, but lots of demand from buyers. There is perhaps nothing more important than this in my mind as this kind of strategy from big corporate buyers means the demand of Bitcoin has at least semi-permanently shifted higher against relative supply. A strong buy, even at new highs While chasing new highs in any asset can be counterintuitive, I think that’s actually the right move here. Whether we get a move back towards $90k or not, as we get further into 2025, it is my view that $98k is going to look like a bargain. We’ll see, but I see nothing but support for higher prices as we look over the medium term, although there is likely to be chopping short-term, as there often is. Bitcoin is a strong buy.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | BTG,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4739916-chase-bitcoin-at-all-time-highs-absolutely-yes?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/36791397.jpeg

These 5 Best Crypto Presale Projects are Flying Off the Shelves!,"As the cryptocurrency market continues to adapt, selecting the right presale project could be the key to significant long-term returns in 2025 and beyond. Presales allow early access to innovative projects before they hit mainstream markets, maximizing ROI potential as they mature. This guide highlights 5 of the best crypto presale projects that offer unique solutions and a chance for life-changing profits. Each presale arrives with massive benefits—from solid growth potential to innovative solutions that set them apart from the rest of the ecosystem. Read on to find out which presale crypto will likely see the highest return. 1. BlockDAG: A Next-Gen Blockchain Showing Explosive Growth BlockDAG (BDAG) is taking the crypto world by storm with its incredible presale track record. Currently, in batch 26, BlockDAG has raised almost $150 million with 16.3 billion coins sold. Early movers have already seen an incredible 2240% ROI when BDAG’s price rose from $0.001 in presale batch 1 to $0.0234 in the current 26th batch. BlockDAG’s claim to fame is its revolutionary Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) architecture, offering faster transactions, lower fees, and scalability beyond what traditional blockchains can provide. The network recently raised $20 million in just 48 hours, making it one of the best and fastest growing crypto presale projects right now. BlockDAG’s scalability, low fees, and a fully developed ecosystem are designed to support mass adoption, giving it the ability to compete with the titans of the crypto industry. It’s also worth noting that the platform’s ongoing BULLRUN100 bonus, offering double the number of BDAG coins plus early airdrop access, is ending in 4 days. All in all, with BDAG priced at just $0.0234 per coin and BULLRUN100 slipping away, now’s an ideal time for buyers to join the presale. 2. Flockerz (FLOCK): Meme Coin Offering Real Control Flockerz (FLOCK) combines meme coin appeal with a vote-to-earn (V2E) system, allowing token holders to participate directly in governance. As one of the best crypto presale projects, FLOCK is gaining momentum as it taps into the growing demand for decentralized governance and community-driven projects. The strong community engagement and potential for significant rewards make it an attractive option for early investors. However, Flockerz’s reliance on user participation for success could be a challenge. If community engagement fades, the project’s impact may be limited. Still, the innovative approach to governance and staking rewards is intriguing. 3. DexBoss (DEBO): DeFi Platform Ready to Disrupt the Market DexBoss (DEBO) offers a fresh take on DeFi, with a deflationary model and passive income opportunities through staking and liquidity farming. Its presale is drawing attention, with early-stage investors expecting up to 15x returns upon listing. The platform aims to provide high-leverage trading tools, enabling traders to earn passive rewards while contributing to the growth of the DeFi ecosystem. A potential downside for DexBoss is its dependence on the performance of the broader DeFi market. If DeFi growth slows, so could DexBoss’s prospects. 4. Pepe Unchained (PEPU): Meme Coin Meets Layer 2 Innovation Pepe Unchained (PEPU) combines the fun of meme coins with the power of Layer 2 solutions. Having raised over $35 million, Pepe Unchained is one of the best crypto presale projects in the meme coin space. The addition of Pepe Chain ensures scalability, making it a more efficient platform for meme coin trading and staking. While meme coins can often be subject to volatility, Pepe Unchained’s Layer 2 improvements help provide more stability. Still, the project must prove that it can sustain growth beyond its initial hype. 5. Shiba Shootout (SHIBASHOOT): Combining Fun and Financial Rewards Shiba Shootout’s (SHIBASHOOT) Play-to-Earn (P2E) game has high financial potential. Set in a Wild West universe, players can earn $SHIBASHOOT tokens through duels and missions. The success of Shiba Shootout relies heavily on its ability to attract and retain players. If the game fails to build a large, engaged player base, its potential could be limited. The project has raised over $1.4 million in its presale, with an added incentive of high APYs through its Cactus Staking program. Which Presale Is Right for You? There is it—the best crypto presale projects of this year. Each one of them offers unique features for different types of buyers. Flockerz offers governance opportunities for those who enjoy community-driven projects. DexBoss appeals to DeFi enthusiasts looking for passive income, while Pepe Unchained brings Layer 2 efficiency to the meme coin market. Shiba Shootout combines fun with financial rewards, offering gamified potential. Beyond memecoins, BlockDAG’s scalability and low fees make it ideal for those seeking fresh tech with massive growth potential. The fact that BlockDAG could raise $20 million in just four days proves its sky-high demand. Plus with 2240% ROI already delivered, the returns that await holders down the road are clearly massive.

While predicting the next big winner is a challenge, certain assets show promise by capitalizing on innovation and market momentum. Recent trends highlight significant price hikes, with some coins breaking key resistance levels, signaling bullish momentum. Others face corrections as investors rotate focus toward emerging projects. This dynamic market is driven by adoption, technological advancements, and trading activity. As speculation grows, BlockDAG, Solana, Render, Aave, and Ethereum emerge as the top 5 crypto coins to watch in Q4! BlockDAG (BDAG): Redefining Speed & Global Trade Imagine a blockchain so swift and efficient it feels like the Usain Bolt of crypto— that's what BlockDAG (BDAG ) brings to the market. This rising star is backed by a hybrid blockchain & directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure. Put simply, this combination eliminates traditional blockchain bottlenecks, enabling ultra-fast transactions, unmatched scalability, and fortified security. With BlockDAG’s speedy transactions, international trade gets an adrenaline boost, settling payments instantly and leaving sluggish banking systems in the dust. For enterprises chasing speed and reliability in global commerce, BlockDAG is the solution. This network’s presale momentum is equally exciting, with $20 million raised in just 48 hours, pushing total revenue to $150 million. The coin price has skyrocketed by 2240%, reaching $0.0234 as of Batch 26. With analysts projecting $0.05 per BDAG coin by Batch 45, the coin value is set to surge by triple digits, making it one of the top crypto coins to watch today. BlockDAG’s roadmap also reveals a massive growth potential, expanding its reach into diverse market solutions. With a 2240% price already achieved, analysts predict a 30,000x ROI for those who manage to join the presale early. Solana (SOL): Record Speeds with Bullish Momentum Solana is yet another top crypto coin to watch with SOL showing bullish momentum, with $6.7 billion in trading volume as investors eye all-time highs. Known for its speed, Solana is one of the fastest blockchains, averaging up to 1,504 daily transactions. It powers DeFi services, NFT minting, and dApps to power extensive adoption. Following significant losses in 2022–2023, SOL’s 2024 rebound has delivered impressive returns, with potential for further growth depending on market conditions and sustained investor confidence. Render (RNDR): Harassing AI-Power with a $10 Target Render Token (RNDR) has broken the $7.50–$7.70 resistance, signaling bullish momentum with short-term targets of $10 and $13 due to rising adoption. Its decentralized network lets users rent unused GPU power, providing real-world applications, such as creating Westworld season four’s opening titles. With over 40 million frames rendered, including a 17.7% year-over-year increase in Q1 2024, growing demand for AI-generated and media visuals further supports RNDR’s upward trajectory and trend reversal. Aave (AAVE): Dominating RWA Market, Price Hikes Ahead Aave (AAVE) has surged past $120 resistance, reaching $180.74 in September 2024, with analysts predicting a rise to $244.30 by year-end. Aave, a DeFi protocol, enables crypto lending and borrowing via smart contracts, eliminating intermediaries. Its innovative real-world asset (RWA) market, developed with Centrifuge, allows businesses to tokenize assets and borrow stablecoins. Following trends in AI and decentralized apps, Aave’s growth aligns with the broader crypto recovery, as major coins show upward momentum after a prolonged bear market. Ethereum (ETH): Blockchain Gaint, But Facing a 23% Dip Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, faces a potential 23% decline as the focus shifts to other altcoins. A price drop below the 50-day EMA signals waning bullish momentum, with $2,817 as a critical support level. If breached, ETH could fall to $2,200. Despite this, Ethereum remains a leader in blockchain innovation, pioneering smart contracts for dApps. Its shift to a proof-of-stake system in 2022 improved energy efficiency, and the SEC's 2024 approval of Ethereum ETFs highlights ongoing institutional interest. In Summary: Top 5 Crypto Coins to Watch The crypto market remains dynamic, with Solana and Render showing strong bullish trends, while Ethereum faces a potential decline as investors shift focus. AAVE continues to climb, surpassing key resistance levels and projecting further growth. Among these fluctuations, BlockDAG is a solid option as one of the best crypto coins to watch. Its advanced DAG architecture, enables unmatched transaction speed and scalability, inviting major real-world applications. With increasing adoption across industries and $150 million raised across just 26 presale batches, BlockDAG’s growth trajectory reflects its potential to dominate the market beyond other crypto contenders.

We also have a date, he’s going to leave on January 20, 2025. This confirmation has sparked hope amongst analysts and crypto enthusiasts that his exit should mark the end of the stormy relationship with the SEC. While markets are rallying based on rumors about Gensler’s resignation, the official announcement will probably push Binance Coin (BNB) and XRP prices to new price gains. Both Binance Coin (BNB) and XRP prices need to be carefully evaluated and compared with higher growth choices like INTL. Ripple (XRP) to Smash $3 Benchmark in the Current Market Rally XRP price rose almost 24.75% after the announcement of SEC Chair Gensler’s resignation and has broken through its resistance price of $1.37. Experts predict that this breakthrough will set the base for Ripple to continue this rally. Technicals are also giving strong buy signals for this coin. Source: CoinMarketCap However, unlike expectations of $3, the next price investors should watch is $1.59, which is Ripple’s three-year high. XRP price last touched this range in April 2021. Long-term predictions are set at the coin crossing the $3 barrier. Binance Coin (BNB) Unlikely to Breach $1000 Benchmark in the Current Rally While crypto is having a revival of sorts, the wild predictions circulating need to be put to rest. Unlike many other coins, Binance Coin (BNB) has performed well YOY independent of any industry-wide rally. In fact, the current rally seems to have slowed its upward drive. Source: CoinMarketCap The coin grew by 165.54% in 2024 and is currently at $625.21. Out of this, growth has slowed in rallying November to just 7.39%. While technicals support the buying inclination, investors must realize that the $1000 benchmark is far off for BNB for now. The predictions by analysts forecast a range of $550 to $700 for Binance Coin (BNB) by 2025. This leaves the wild predictions of $1000 prices as pipe dreams. Instead, it makes commercial sense for investors to pick quick growth options like INTL. IntelMarkets INTL Poised for 4000% Take Off into History IntelMarkets (INTL) is a dynamic crypto trading ecosystem offering users access to perpetual futures contracts with advanced leverage options. Perpetual futures are attractive for investors as they do not have any expiry dates. This is one of the reasons why the project is getting attention from the industry. IntelMarkets users will get incomparable flexibility and scalability from its dual-chain architecture built on both Ethereum and Solana blockchains.

INTL has already raised $2.45 million from Fortune 500 investors and a sovereign wealth fund. It has recently opened up investment for general investors. Conclusion Both Binance Coin (BNB) and XRP prices are rising, although for completely different reasons. The improvement in the crypto market outlook after SEC Chair Gensler’s announcement means that there is an optimistic outlook for all crypto projects. Upcoming projects like Intel Markets INTL will benefit from this optimism but will deliver on their performance parameters. However, careful assessment of existing coins will show that these claims of XRP price touching $3 and BNB touching $1000 are a little too early.

However, volatility has to catch up with most tokens eventually, and some coins might be past their best by now. Dogecoin (DOGE) has re-traced from its latest spike, and TRON (TRX) might cool off once it's past its ATH. The trading focus is shifting to the new tokens, and DTX Exchange (DTX) is on everyone's radar now. Here is why! Dogecoin Dips Following a $0.44 Price Surge The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) started out as a joke from billionaire CEO Elon Musk while he was campaigning for Donald Trump earlier in the year. That joke is now a reality, as the President-elect has formed a Federal department under the same name, placing Musk as co-lead with Vivek Ramaswamy. That might mean a new future for Dogecoin, as the token has spent the past week in a surge following the announcement. Dogecoin’s DOGE reached its three-year peak at $0.43 in that time, keeping with its fairly consistent bullishness in the past three weeks. The spike came with a downside. The DOGE price has been in a correction since touching $0.44, as the DOGE token currently trades at $0.38. There's no certainty of a comeback, or how soon that will be, and Dogecoin traders are already considering more profitable options. TRON’s TRX is on Its Way to ATH; Will It Hold? The TRX token has been one of the more lackluster coins in the crypto-verse in the past three years. Together with Cardano and Ripple, there had been limited excitement on the TRON network until this year. TRON’s charts reveal three highs in the past year; in Q1, Q3, and the latest spike that has seen it close in on its ATH. The TRX token's highest valuation is about $0.2075; the token is trading at $0.1995, less than a cent, and with enough momentum to push the limits. TRON is trending because of CEO Justin Sun’s antiques, as the founder bought a banana-inspired art piece, “Comedian.” While the token has had a great run to date, there might be a block after reaching its ATH. Access Multiple Trading Markets With DTX Exchange From widespread usage, crypto trading features seem to be all that decentralized exchanges offer. The other digital financial markets are walled off from crypto traders, requiring that they constantly shift between apps to trade stock or Forex. DTX Exchange solves that challenge, offering all three markets on a platform that guarantees security and stability. The Forex, stock, and crypto markets and their trading instruments are all available on the DTX Exchange ecosystem, existing on one hybrid blockchain, VulcanX. With over 100,000 tradable assets featuring elements of each of the markets, DTX users have access to foreign currencies, equity products like bonds, shares, and, of course, crypto tokens. The DTX Exchange project takes the trading possibilities even further with its real-world assets trading options, where users will be able to trade commodities backed by crypto tokens. All your trading activity can be tracked on the DTX Unified wallet, where users can get instant reports on the state of their portfolios at a glance. Again, you don't have to keep multiple apps for your trading–you only need one app that keeps all your assets together. The DTX Presale Offers 100% ROI as TRX and Dogecoin Face Uncertainty As uncertainty begins to cloud TRX and Dogecoin, the DTX Exchange project is presenting an exciting profit option for investors. DTX Exchange sports features that analysts believe could set the project on track for bullish runs in the coming months. DTX token is available in its public presale at the moment, with the Stage 5 price pegged at $0.10. With the launch price already set at $0.20, investors have a chance at 100% ROI when the project hits major exchanges.

Now, a top Ethereum bull has turned the focus to an altcoin still under development on the Ethereum blockchain: Rexas Finance (RXS). Rexas Finance , which is barely $0.09 in its presale stage right now, has drawn interest from both crypto experts and fans alike; some estimate it could explode to $12 in the next few weeks. What drives this optimistic attitude? Let's explore Rexas Finance's characteristics, relationship with Ethereum, and reasons it is likely to have explosive expansion. Ethereum (ETH): Launchpad for Innovation Thanks to Ethereum's strong infrastructure for distributed apps (dApps), some of the most successful projects have been born out of its ecosystem. Launching initiatives like Rexas Finance, which uses Ethereum's security, scalability, and smart contract capabilities, it is the perfect platform because of its general acceptance and developer-friendly characteristics. Using Ethereum's blockchain, Rexas Finance tokenizes actual assets—including real estate, commodities, and fine art—RWA. This expanding industry fits exactly Ethereum's capacity to manage complicated transactions and provide smooth interfaces with distributed finance systems. Introducing Rexas Finance (RXS) Rexas Finance (RXS) is a creative tool meant to close the gap between conventional asset management and blockchain technology. Tokenizing actual assets offers a clear, safe, and quick approach for investors to vary their portfolios. The project already shows good foundations because its presale phases create significant momentum. At $0.09 right now, Rexas Finance has raised about $11.34 million from almost 190 million sold tokens. Its road map calls for listing on big exchanges at $0.20—a 150% increase for early investors. However, the Ethereum bull supporting this altcoin claims that the actual growth potential is outside of its initial exchange listing, with forecasts of a rapid ascent to $12 in just a few weeks. Why the Ethereum Bull Is Backing Rexas Finance The trust of the Ethereum bull in Rexas Finance derives from its special value proposition and ability to transform asset tokenizing. Here's why well-known investors have taken an eye on this altcoin: Practical Application: Unlike many cryptocurrencies driven just by hype, Rexas Finance answers real market needs. Encouragement of the tokenization of real-world assets provides the path for more liquidity, lower transaction costs, and worldwide accessibility for assets historically difficult to trade. Strategic Integration of Ethereum: Built on Ethereum, Rexas Finance gains from the sophisticated smart contract ecosystem and general acceptance of the blockchain. Rexas Finance fits the Ethereum ecosystem naturally because of the security, scalability, and interoperability this integration guarantees. Strong Present Momentum: The success of the RXS presale is evidence of its developing community and investor trust. The $11.24 million gathered thus far shows how ready the market is for ideas like Rexas Finance, which mix blockchain innovation with practical uses. RWA Tokenization: Market Prospect: With some estimates reaching trillions of dollars in the next few years, the real-world asset tokenization industry is expected to explode tremendously. Rexas Finance is positioned to take advantage of this enormous possibility by projecting itself as a leader in this field. Can RXS Reach $12 in Weeks? Although Rexas Finance's projection of rising from $0.09 to $12 in just a few weeks seems ambitious, the forecast of Ethereum bull is based on reasonable logic. Projects having strong foundations, original value propositions, and significant community support have historically grown exponentially during bull markets. RXS's visibility and trading volume will probably benefit much from the forthcoming listing on main exchanges. Rexas Finance's Ethereum-based architecture also helps it to leverage DeFi protocols and get acceptance among the crypto community. Given the rising interest in real-world asset tokenization, a fast price gain is within the range of the present presale momentum and the token attracts attention from institutional investors. Conclusion Offering a special mix of blockchain technology and practical uses, Rexas Finance is looking to be among the most exciting Ethereum-based initiatives. Given the support of a well-known Ethereum bull and a solid presale performance, it is not surprising that RXS is becoming the next great altcoin. At $0.09 right now, Rexas Finance offers early investors a great prospect. As this project keeps creating waves in the asset tokenizing scene, the $12 prediction of the Ethereum bull emphasizes the great development possibility of this project. Rexas Finance is surely a project worth examining regardless of whether it meets this high aim in the next few weeks.

36790729,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=654676,1732458652,Spot Ethereum ETFs End 6-Day Drought With $90 Million Inflow — Will Ether Price Respond?,"Investor interest in the spot Ethereum ETFs (exchange-traded funds) appeared to have waned after failing to register a net inflow day for six consecutive days. However, the cryptocurrency products ended the week on a high with a substantial capital influx on Friday, November 22. This capital inflow represents a shift in investor sentiment, which has not particularly been positive over the past few days. Nonetheless, the market would be hoping that this newly found momentum would persist and perhaps also trigger some bullish action for the ETH price. Can Ethereum ETFs Ensure ETH’s Price Recovery? According to the latest data from SoSoValue, the United States-based spot Ethereum ETFs witnessed a net inflow of $91.21 million on Friday. This positive single-day performance represents the first net inflow for the exchange-traded funds since November 13. Related Reading: This Analyst Correctly Predicted The Bitcoin Price Jump To $99,000, But His Prediction Is Not Done Market data shows that a significant portion of the inflows came from BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (with the ticker ETHA). The crypto product registered around $99.7 million in total daily inflows to close the previous week. Fidelity’s Ethereum Fund (with the ticker FETH) and Bitwise’s Ether ETF (ETHW) were the only other products to post capital inflows on Friday, recording $5.76 million and $4.96 million, respectively. Grayscale’s ETHE and ETH registered outflows of over $18.5 million and $621,000, respectively. As earlier mentioned, Friday’s performance represents a return to positive inflows for the Ethereum ETFs. Prior to this showing, the crypto products posted six consecutive outflow days, draining a cumulative total of $225.6 million within this period. The price of ETH, which initially seemed to have found its footing, also slowed down during this period of the Ethereum ETFs outflow. This trend highlights the significant influence of the exchange-traded funds on price action — both for the world’s largest cryptocurrency Bitcoin and Ethereum. With the fortunes of the US-based Ethereum ETFs seemingly turning around, the price of ETH has also taken an upward swing in the last couple of days. Investors will be hoping that the positive momentum for the Ethereum ETFs continues and translates into the altcoin’s price. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of ETH stands at around $3,423, reflecting a 2.1% increase in the past day. The altcoin is up by more than 9% on the weekly timeframe, according to data from CoinGecko. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Mirrors 2017 Pattern, Is The Top Only 2 Weeks Away After Hitting $100,000?

Can it Maintain Upward Momentum?","Polkadot (DOT) has witnessed an exceptional surge recently, gaining over 100% in the last month with a weekly gain of 55%, which brought the price up to above $8. A breakout in the early hours of the day saw DOT test the $10 resistance level. Polkadot (DOT) surged massively over the past month, gaining over 100%. In the past few trading sessions, DOT outperformed most of the market, including a hefty 30% gain on Saturday. DOT Tests $10 Level Polkadot (DOT) looks to close the week on a very bullish note as a massive 55% weekly gain sees it currently trading above the $8 level. DOT is on a bullish streak since falling to an intra-day low of $3.65 at the start of November. A massive recovery since then saw DOT briefly visit the $10 level early this morning before returning to now trade around $8.54. DOT started the current week with an almost 11% rally on Monday to reach an intraday high of $6.10 before declining and settling at $6. Despite Monday’s significant gains, DOT fell back in the red on Tuesday, registering a 3.33% drop and settling at $5.80. DOT saw a volatile session on Wednesday as buyers and sellers battled to establish control, resulting in a day high of $6.12 and a low of $5.54. Sellers were victorious, but the price managed to marginally recover from its intraday low, eventually settling at $5.73, a 1.21% decline. Buyers managed to take control of Thursday’s session, pushing DOT up over 3% to settle at $5.9. Buyers were able to maintain control of the session. A very bullish session saw buyers drive DOT above the critical $6 level, gaining nearly 12% to reach a day high of $6.68, with the price eventually setting at $6.6. DOT was able to hold firm at this critical demand level, indicating an imminent breakout. Bullish Sentiment Intensifies, DOT Rockets After reaching its psychological level at $6 on Friday, DOT witnessed an immense breakout, gaining nearly 30% in the session and pushing DOT over the $8 mark to settle at $8.50. Increased trading activity and stronger bullish pressure have driven DOT’s upward momentum, and $8, which previously acted as a resistance level, has become a support zone. All technical indicators reveal a bullish outlook. The RSI entered the overbought zone, which reflects increased buying pressure and suggests continued upward momentum. Intensified bullish momentum, market volatility, and a massive volume surge all conspired to send DOT over $10 in the early hours of today’s trading session. Buyers successfully pushed DOT above $10, reaching a day high of $10.29, before falling back to the $8 level. At the time of writing, DOT traded at $8.65.

36812802,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=102606,1732455496,Shiba Inu to $0.01: Expert Says Crypto Has Proven the Impossible Can Happen,"Renowned crypto analyst Luis Delgado (popularly referred to as Del Crxpto) explains why he believes Shiba Inu might surge to $0.01. The one-cent dream remains one of the greatest aspirations for many Shiba Inu investors. Since the forecast was first issued years back, several community members have been deliberating on whether Shiba Inu would ever hit the target in its lifetime. Delgado Explains Why SHIB Can Reach $0.01Most analysts are skeptical about the possibility of SHIB’s price surging to $0.01, as they constantly refer to the prediction as unrealistic. However, prominent crypto analyst Luis Delgado (a.k.a. Del Crxpto) thinks otherwise. Responding to critics who think the $0.01 target is unrealistic, the analyst asserted that he has seen the impossible happen in crypto on several occasions. This suggests that Delgado has experienced unexpected price surges or events that have become a reality within the crypto market. The $0.01 prediction for Shiba Inu remains one of the most ambitious targets the token has received since its inception. Clinching this target would see Shiba Inu eliminate two zeros from its price. For Shiba Inu to reach $0.01, the token must surge 37,311% from its current price of $0.00002673. The target would also push Shiba Inu’s market cap to a whopping $5.91 trillion, eventually making SHIB the world’s largest cryptocurrency. At $0.01, a holding of 10 million SHIB tokens, currently valued at $267.3, would be worth $100,000. Shiba Inu to $0.01 Prediction Even though Shiba Inu requires a hefty surge to bring the one-cent dream to fruition, several stakeholders are optimistic about its prospect. This is not the first time Delgado thinks the $0.01 target is attainable for Shiba Inu. He expressed optimism about the forecast in July, referencing Dogecoin’s historical price rally as a precedent. Last month, Shiba Inu’s marketing specialist Lucie also expressed her confidence in the prediction, indicating that SHIB would clinch the $0.01 target in its lifetime. In March, when Shiba Inu surged to $0.000045, two Bitcoin enthusiasts forecasted that SHIB would hit the $0.01 target someday. Interestingly, some experts have demonstrated strong confidence in the prediction by setting specific timelines for the forecast to play out. For instance, Jason Williams and Yazan project that the price of Shiba Inu would soar beyond $0.01 to $0.05 this cycle. Additionally, analysts at Changelly speculate that Shiba Inu would trade at $0.01 between 2033 and 2040. While the $0.01 target requires the price of SHIB to surge tremendously, Shiba Inu has shown its capacity for recording huge rallies. This was observed in the 2020/2021 bull run when SHIB rallied from $0.000000000056 to $0.00008845 in 14 months.",POSITIVE,SHIB,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/24/shiba-inu-to-0-01-expert-says-crypto-has-proven-the-impossible-can-happen/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=shiba-inu-to-0-01-expert-says-crypto-has-proven-the-impossible-can-happen,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

MSTY is an actively managed option income ETF that generates monthly income by selling call options on MSTR, aiming for high yields and capped price gains. Despite Bitcoin's volatility, MSTY offers a strategic way to gain exposure while generating substantial income, making it a valuable addition to a diversified portfolio. Selling MSTY PUT is a safer income strategy, potentially generating high monthly income. Introduction When I recommended to buy YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF ( MSTY ) about half a year ago, one of the main reasons was the diversification of income sources. However, the situation changed quickly, the incoming US administration has shown considerable interest in Bitcoin for various reasons. It is highly expected that TRUMP 2.0 could "" create a friendly regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies. "", according to Reuters . I believe that Bitcoin may have a strong tailwind in 2025 and beyond. Therefore, there are now more reasons to increase MSTY's exposure in order to obtain the super income at a yield topping 130%. In this article, I will also discuss how I plan to use MSTY as seeding funding to establish cryptocurrency positions by employing option wheel and dividend reinvesting strategies. These methods will enable me to build investments focused on cryptocurrency, increase safety margin, and prepare for and prepare for the upcoming season. MSTY Option ETF Overview MSTY is an actively managed option income ETF from YieldMax. The fund strategy is actually pretty simple, as shown below from its official site, MSTY seeks to generate monthly income by selling/writing call options on MSTR. MSTY pursues a strategy that aims to harvest compelling yields, while retaining capped participation in the price gains of MSTR. The following is the current holdings in MSTY portfolio. There are many call options with different expiration dates in November. The main source of income comes from monthly covered call options highlighted in green. The covered calls are supported by the short PUT options and the long call option colored in yellow. The other options are call spreads one week (per Nov. 29) after the monthly schedule (Nov. 22). The spreads are used to earn additional premium income. I think it is very important to understand that the described option positioning can be repeated every month. As long as the options market is active and favorable for MSTY, this income mechanism is very reliable. MSTY Current Holdings - from Author compilation using YieldMax data Six months ago, when I started to cover MSTY, I indicated that "" MicroStrategy's (MSTR) Bitcoin holdings are now worth $14 billion, more than half of its entire market value. "" However, due to the significant rebound in Bitcoin prices during the US election, its Bitcoin holdings have now become a huge ""Bitcoin cache"" of $26 billion . On the other hand, as reported in the recent earnings report, the company's software business continues to be sluggish. The company does position itself as centered around a Bitcoin strategy, as shown below. MicroStrategy Performance under the Bitcoin Strategy - from MicroStrategy Q3 report MSTR's stock price is highly volatile and has a large trading volume in the market. All of these make MSTY option income EFT highly operable. In fact, MSTY has developed into one of the largest YieldMax ETFs in just 9 months. The following is a summary of the main market characteristics of MSTY and my brief comments. Assets ((AUM)): $1.27B. It is one of the largest YieldMax ETFs. Most of them are less than $1B. Volume (recent): 2,323,453. It is a heavily traded fund. Inception: February, 21 2024. It is a new and fast-growing ETF. Distribution Rate*: 130.57%. The dividend is paid monthly. Yield may vary due to volatility. Expense Ratio: 0.99%. 52-Week HV: 77. Volatility is one of the highest in YieldMax option ETFs. How I play MSTY for income and develop positions gradually Many people in the financial industry may view Bitcoin as the future digital gold due to its strong safe haven asset properties. The fact that the market value of Bitcoin currently exceeds one trillion US dollars makes it a very important investment asset class. The newly elected US government seems to be more friendly towards decentralized cryptocurrencies. The government's relaxation of regulation on cryptocurrencies will bring tremendous impetus to the Bitcoin market. I personally believe that Bitcoin does provide an excellent market for long-term investments. The incoming US government may help bring it closer to becoming ""the 21st century digital gold"". However, a major issue with playing Bitcoin is its extreme volatility, making it a high-risk asset. This volatility is reflected in Bitcoin players such as MSTR. In fact, MSTR has 52-Week HV over 102, which is obviously too high for many investors. One alternative is to buy and hold Option ETF MSTY as its volatility is much lower(52-Week HV: 76.9). Investors may still point to 76.9, which is about 3x volatility compared to some traditional income-focused asset classes holdings like REITs, BDCs etc. However, I believe that high volatility provides high income because call option premiums will be higher. This is precisely why MSTY can provide up to three digit yield. I suspect there might be some kind of optimum point between the volatility for (option) income and the stability for principal (price). A simple way to look at it is that we could literally set aside 100% cash in just one year time when invest in MSTY with such high yield. In terms of ""duration risk"" for the capital, this would probably be as safe as we can get on a dynamic (variable yield rate) basis. There is a well-known capped-gain effect for covered call strategy. I have discussed a few solutions to deal with it in my past write-up . My favorite strategy here is to reinvest the income back in MSTY or directly in underlying MSTR. This approach is sometime known as DRIPs (dividend reinvestment plans). Using only the dividends to increase Bitcoin exposure is a better strategy for dealing with high volatility because 1) we can build the position gradually and 2) we can stop reinvesting if the market condition is turning to ""unfriendly"". Keep in mind, we always have the flexibility of reinvesting the partial dividend. MSTY Option Wheel is a more attractive and safer alternative It is worth mentioning that MSTY has tradable option chains on itself. The following is a snapshot of some PUT options for December. MSTY PUT Options for December - from barchart.com Notice that the highlighted PUT on $32 strike price is worth about $4.8 by taking the Mid price. According to the most recent distribution announcement, MSTY "" declares $4.421 dividend "" for December. I could simply sell a $32 PUT option to get a higher cash income of $480 for the obligation of buying 100 MSTY shares at $32, if MSTY price is dropped below it on December 20. The income is about 8% higher than receiving $442 dividend on December distribution day. Keep in mind, I don't need to own 100 MSTY shares to get the income. Another key feature of this strategy is that income is safer income. I have to buy 100 shares at the current price($33.7), which is higher than $32. So there is actually a price advantage of $1.7 (5%). Considering the high volatility of MSTY prices, I am more inclined to sell put options to obtain higher returns and establish some safety cushion for the committed investment capital. Like dividend DRIP, I can use the proceeds from selling put options to invest in any cryptocurrency stock of my choice. This method is very similar to Option Wheel, except that the base wheel can be a different equity. Note that if the stock is placed on me when the MSTY price is below the target ($32 in our case study), I can choose to keep the stock and receive monthly dividends from MSTY, it is just like returning to the MSTY investment approach, discussed in the previous section; Alternatively, if the volatility remains at a high level, I can choose to sell these stocks and resume my put option selling process. Risks and Caveats The bullish Bitcoin is the key assumption of our thesis in this article. Due to the high volatility of price behavior, any deviation in this prediction may seriously affect the performance of MSTY. The sustained downward trend of MSTR may lead to poor performance of the fund for a period of time. Investors should also be fully aware of the common pitfalls of the single-underlying ETF mentioned in the MSTY website (linked earlier), including capped gains, non-diversification etc. Closing Thoughts Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies may receive certain catalysts from the new policies that the US government may introduce in 2025. Digital gold may arrive earlier than we expected. I suggest using MSTY to start building positions centered around Bitcoin. When the underlying price volatility reaches high levels, MSTY option income ETF can provide ultra-high dividend distributions with high double or even triple digits. I also suggest selling MSTY put options, if conditions permit, to obtain higher and safer income. The revenue from MSTY and PUT sales can be used to gradually establish Bitcoin positions. I intend to maintain my BUY rating on MSTY due to the promising Bitcoin outlook and various ways to earn income from playing MSTY.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4739905-msty-profit-from-bullish-bitcoin-trend?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/36789059.jpeg

However, investors appear to be undeterred by the sluggish price action of the premier cryptocurrency in the past few days. Bitcoin Taker Buy/Sell Ratio Is Rising — Impact On Price In a November 23 post on the X platform, prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared that traders have taken to loading their bags with Bitcoin in recent days. This on-chain observation is based on the “taker buy/sell ratio,” which tracks the taker buy and taker sell volumes for a specific cryptocurrency. A greater-than-one value of the taker buy/sell ratio suggests that the taker buy volume is higher than the taker sell volume. This is usually considered a bullish signal, which suggests the willingness of investors to pay a higher price for a particular cryptocurrency (Bitcoin, in this case). Related Reading: Altcoins Continue To Surge Following Trump’s Victory – More Gains Ahead? In contrast, when the metric’s value is less than 1, it means that more sellers are willing to sell their assets at a lower price. Typically, this indicates a bearish sentiment amongst investors, as the selling pressure is overshadowing the buying pressure in the specific market. Martinez highlighted in his post on X that the Bitcoin taker buy/sell ratio across major trading platforms, including Binance, OKX, HTX, and Bybit, has witnessed a significant surge in the past day. As shown in the chart below, the metric spiked to a value of over 28 on Binance, the world’s largest exchange. Similarly, the Bitcoin taker buy/sell ratio climbed well above the 1 threshold, showing the mounting buying pressure in the open market. This level of intense buying activity could ensure that the premier cryptocurrency continues its rally toward the $100,000 milestone. As of this writing, the price of BTC stands around $97,800, reflecting a 1.1% decline in the last 24 hours. Nevertheless, the flagship cryptocurrency’s performance on the weekly timeframe is still impressive. According to CoinGecko data, BTC is up by nearly 8% in the past week. Who Is Buying? In another post on the X platform, Martinez revealed that a notable cohort of large investors (also known as whales) have been active in the Bitcoin market in the past few days. This class of whales involved here are those holding between 100 and 1,000 coins. According to data from Santiment, whales have purchased more than 40,000 BTC (equivalent to around $3.96 billion) in the past four days. Considering their influence on market dynamics, this buying activity from the Bitcoin whales could be bullish for price.

36812801,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=102572,1732446955,"Expert Says Dogecoin is the ‘Budget Version’ of XRP, Expects DOGE to Mirror XRP Uptrend","An expert trader believes Dogecoin is the “budget version” of XRP, suggesting the price of DOGE could follow the same uptrend XRP recently witnessed. This sentiment was shared on X by DonAlt, a notable market expert with years of experience. Remarkably, data from two accompanying charts confirmed that XRP and Dogecoin had followed a similar price trajectory since early November, amid political developments in the U.S.Dogecoin and XRP Trail Similar PathsNotably, from Nov. 5, following the latest U.S. presidential election which saw pro-crypto candidate Donald Trump emerge victorious, DOGE was one of the earliest beneficiaries of the resulting market trend. This was partly due to Elon Musk’s contributions to the Trump victory.Dogecoin witnessed an impressive spike, soaring from $0.1513 on Nov. 5 to a peak of $0.4389 on Nov. 12, a level it had not seen since June 2021. This marked a massive 190% increase within a week. However, following the $0.4389 top, Dogecoin faced immense resistance, dropping to a low of $0.3401 five days later. Despite this pullback, the bulls demonstrated resilience, firmly defending the $0.34 territory and hedging against any steeper slump.This battle between bulls and bears led to an impasse, with Dogecoin largely consolidating between $0.34 and $0.43 for up to ten days. Nonetheless, amid the consolidation phase, multiple analysts expect an imminent breakout soon.Interestingly, the daily XRP chart reveals that XRP followed a similar price trajectory as Dogecoin within the same timeframe earlier in the month. For context, XRP rallied 150% from $0.5033 on Nov. 5 to a three-year top of $1.26 on Nov. 16. After this high, it also faced consolidation. Dogecoin and XRP 1D Charts | DonAlt However, unlike Dogecoin, XRP only traded within a range for four days. By Nov. 21, the altcoin recorded an impressive 12.86% intraday gain, allowing it to surpass the previous high and has continued to spike since then, especially following SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s resignation note .DOGE Could Mimic XRP BreakoutDonAlt’s commentary suggests Dogecoin is on track to record similar price movements. As of press time, DOGE has already surpassed the previous $0.4389 peak, having surged to a top of $0.4653 earlier in the morning. This bullish move already prepares the groundwork for a rally that follows XRP’s path .A structure that further bolsters the idea that both tokens are moving in the same trajectory is the formation of a bull flag on both daily charts. This pattern forms when an asset skyrockets sharply and then faces consolidation. It suggests that the previous uptrend would continue once the consolidation breaks.Notably, since it broke out of its consolidation, XRP has gained 34.57% within three days, currently trading for $1.50. A similar push for DOGE would see the meme coin spike to $0.56. However, most analysts expect more substantial surges toward the $1 level and beyond. DOGE now trades for $0.4706, up 13% today.",POSITIVE,DOGE | XRP,ALTCOIN | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/24/expert-says-dogecoin-is-the-budget-version-of-xrp-expects-doge-to-mirror-xrp-uptrend/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=expert-says-dogecoin-is-the-budget-version-of-xrp-expects-doge-to-mirror-xrp-uptrend,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

36784584,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=654608,1732442452,Dogecoin ATH Incoming? Analyst Issues 2-Day Price Forecast,"Crypto analyst Master Kenobi has made a bold two-day prediction for the Dogecoin price, stating that it will hit a new all-time high (ATH) in the next two days. The analyst highlighted Dogecoin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI), which he suggested is very bullish for the meme coin at the moment. Related Reading: XRP Gains Momentum: Whale Activity Points To $15 Breakthrough Dogecoin Price To Reach ATH In Two Days In an X post, Master Kenobi predicted that the Dogecoin price could reach a new ATH in two days. The analyst stated that Dogecoin’s 4-hour RSI chart appears to confirm his fractal setup. Based on this, he remarked that the leg up could potentially reach $0.85 by November 25th, marking a new ATH for the foremost meme coin. Master Kenobi added that some might even identify a potential bullish divergence within the RSI chart. Such a pattern also presents a bullish outlook for the Dogecoin price, indicating that the meme coin is set to witness a bullish reversal to the upside. This bullish reversal is already happening, as DOGE has successfully broken above $0.4. It is worth mentioning that crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade highlighted a bullish divergence on the 4-hour RSI chart. The analyst noted that this signal indicates an uptrend continuation in the Dogecoin price movement. His accompanying chart showed that DOGE could reach $0.7 on its next leg up. This will bring the meme coin close to its ATH of $0.73. Meanwhile, even if the Dogecoin price doesn’t hit a new ATH by November 25, another of Master Kebobi’s analyses shows that it could happen by December 2. The analyst had previously highlighted a 91-day sequence, which he said Dogecoin is about to complete and suggested would lead to a price rally to $1 by December 2. The Next Resistance Level To Watch Out For With the Dogecoin price successfully breaking above $0.4, crypto analyst Kevin Capital has provided insights into the next resistance level to watch out for. In an X post, he noted that Dogecoin is breaking out of the macro .786 Fib level. He added that the next resistance is $0.54, followed by the meme coin’s current ATH at $0.73. Crypto analyst Javon Marks also confirmed that a rally to the current ATH for the Dogecoin price was in sight. In an X post, he said Dogecoin was surging towards $0.6533 and could break out of that level once it reached the target. He added that this 52.2% price surge to $0.6533 could happen quickly and that a rally to $1.25 comes into play once that happens.

Despite briefly testing the level, BTC has yet to break through, leaving investors and analysts eagerly anticipating the next move. With demand remaining robust, the stage appears set for Bitcoin to push past this key barrier in the coming days. Related Reading: Massive Ethereum Buying Spree – Taker Buy Volume Hits $1.683B In One Hour Recent data from CryptoQuant highlights a significant factor driving this rally: the Coinbase Premium Gap, which currently sits at $224. This metric, representing the price difference between Bitcoin on Coinbase and other global exchanges, signals strong buying activity from US Coinbase investors. The relentless upward momentum has further solidified Bitcoin’s dominance in the crypto market, with many viewing the $100,000 level as a critical supply zone. While the price has yet to break through, the ongoing rally reflects a growing belief that Bitcoin’s parabolic bull phase is far from over. As the market approaches this pivotal moment, all eyes remain on BTC’s ability to sustain its momentum and claim new highs, setting the tone for the weeks ahead. Bitcoin Price Action Remains Strong Bitcoin has been in an “only up” phase since November 5, showing no signs of weakness as it consistently climbs to new heights. Even after failing to break above the $100,000 mark yesterday, price action remains incredibly strong. Bulls are firmly in control, and if Bitcoin holds above critical demand levels, the long-anticipated $100,000 milestone could be breached within hours. CryptoQuant analyst Maartunn revealed that robust demand from US investors is a key driving force behind this rally. According to his data, the Coinbase Premium Gap—a metric that tracks the price difference between Bitcoin on Coinbase and other global exchanges—stands at $224. This positive premium underscores US-based buying activity as a significant factor in the current bullish momentum. A high premium often suggests that investors on Coinbase are willing to pay a higher price than others, a strong indicator of heightened demand. Related Reading: Polkadot Holds Key Demand Level – DOT Could Hit $11 In Coming Weeks As the market watches closely, Bitcoin’s ability to maintain its upward trajectory hinges on staying above vital support levels. The psychological resistance at $100,000 remains formidable, but the unyielding appetite from US investors points to continued strength in the days ahead. With such solid fundamentals, many analysts believe Bitcoin is poised for another explosive rally once the $100,000 barrier is decisively cleared. BTC Rally Is Only Starting Bitcoin is trading at $98,800 after a failed breakout above the highly anticipated $100,000 mark. Despite this temporary setback, price action remains firmly bullish as BTC continues to hold above key demand levels, showing resilience and strength in the current market. The failure to retrace to lower prices indicates that bullish momentum is still intact, keeping investors optimistic about a potential breakthrough. If BTC maintains its position above the critical $95,000 support level, the likelihood of a surge past the $100,000 psychological barrier increases significantly. Holding above this level would signal strong buyer interest and the potential for further upside, paving the way for Bitcoin to resume its upward trajectory in the near term. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidation Continues – Charts Signal Potential Breakout However, if Bitcoin fails to hold above $95,000, a retrace to lower demand zones would confirm a short-term correction. Such a pullback could provide the necessary fuel for the next rally, as it would allow the market to consolidate before making another attempt at breaking the $100,000 mark. For now, all eyes remain on Bitcoin’s ability to defend its key support levels as the market anticipates the next major move in this historic rally.

After showing signs of resilience, the digital asset is on an upward trajectory, with strong positive traction setting the stage for further gains. As WIF continues to gain ground, the digital asset is positioning itself for continued growth, pushing past key resistance levels. This article aims to analyze WIF’s current strength, which is propelling the asset toward higher price levels. The goal of examining the key drivers behind this surge, including market sentiment, and technical indicators, is to understand how the meme coin is positioning itself for sustained upward movement. It will also explore the potential for the asset to break through significant resistance points and set new highs while assessing the durability of the rally. WIF’s Bullish Traction: Analyzing The Path Forward WIF has demonstrated renewed positive strength after rebounding from the $2.89 support level, steadily advancing toward the $3.58 resistance level. This recovery indicates a significant shift in sentiment, with buying pressure triggering more price growth. Also, the cryptocurrency is trading above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) on the 4-hour chart, which reinforces the bullish trend and a strong foundation for further gains if WIF successfully breaks above the $3.89 resistance. An examination of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows that the RSI has climbed back above the 50% threshold after experiencing a decline to 40% signaling a resurgence in buying pressure, reflecting renewed bullish momentum in the market. A persistent climb would indicate strong overbought conditions, suggesting robust demand and the possibility of more price growth. Related Reading: Dogwifhat (WIF) Price Set To Skyrocket 2,500%, Predicts Renowned Economist Also, the daily chart highlights WIF’s strong upward momentum, evidenced by the formation of a bullish candlestick as the price rebounds from the $2.89 level. Its position above the SMA further solidifies the positive trend, signaling consistent strength. As WIF continues its ascent, it inspires growing market confidence and paves the way for an extended price increase. Lastly, the daily chart’s RSI has recently surged to 57%, reflecting a strong wave of optimistic sentiment as it maintains a position above the critical 50% threshold. This rebound comes after a temporary dip to 51%, demonstrating the re-emergence of buyers in the market. Resistance Levels To Watch: Can WIF Break Through? As WIF continues its upward trajectory, key resistance levels will play a pivotal role in determining its next move. The immediate challenge lies near the $3.58 mark, a critical threshold that could either pave the way for additional gains or temporarily halt the rally. A successful break above this level could set WIF on course toward new highs, reinforcing its bullish trend. Related Reading: WIF Bulls In Control As RSI Signals Strong Upside Potential However, if WIF fails to surpass the $3.89 resistance, it may face consolidation or a pullback toward the $2.89 support level.

According to a crypto analyst, this pattern, known as the ‘Bullish Megaphone‘, could signal a possible price rise to $10,000 for ETH. Related Reading: Chinese Court Declares Personal Crypto Ownership Legal In Mainland China Bullish Megaphone Sets Stage For Ethereum Price Rise To $10,000 A Blockchain and crypto technical analyst, identified as ‘EtherNasyonal,’ on X (formerly Twitter), has predicted that the Ethereum price could soon surpass $10,000. According to the analyst, Ethereum‘s price action currently showcases a historical chart pattern, the Bullish Megaphone, observed during the 2016 to 2017 bull market. The Bullish Megaphone pattern is a technical indicator consisting of two higher highs and two lower lows, often indicating a potential uptrend continuation for a cryptocurrency. This technical pattern is considered bullish when a cryptocurrency’s price breaks above the trend line with increasing volume. Looking at the analyst’s Ethereum price chart from 2016 to 2017 and another for 2024 to 2025, the Bullish megaphone pattern has formed in both bull cycles. Moreover, at the end of the key technical pattern in 2017, the Ethereum price skyrocketed to new price levels, surpassing the $1,200 mark by 2018. EtherNasyonal has suggested that as Ethereum repeats this pattern in the current bull market, it could signal a similar massive price surge, with a potential rally above $10,000. As of writing, CoinMarketCap reveals that the price of Ethereum is trading at $3,353, marking a 7.24% surge in the last seven days. At its current price, a rally to the $10,000 mark would represent a 198% increase for Ethereum, highlighting a substantial surge in value. The analyst has also noted that altcoins will likely follow Ethereum’s bullish momentum and experience a similar uptrend. This price rally in ETH could further impact the future trajectory of altcoins in the crypto market this bullish cycle. Is The Altcoin Season Here? Historically, Ethereum has been a significant catalyst or determining factor to the start of the highly anticipated altcoin season. While Bitcoin’s dominance tends to decline significantly around this period after experiencing a remarkable bull run, altcoins typically follow this bullish trajectory, with Ethereum taking the lead as it trails behind Bitcoin’s price rally. MikyBull Crypto, a prominent analyst on X, declared that the altcoin season for this current bull cycle has officially begun. For clarity, the altcoin season is after Bitcoin’s consolidation phase, which follows a rally, where smaller-cap cryptocurrencies begin a strong market rally. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Mirrors 2017 Pattern, Is The Top Only 2 Weeks Away After Hitting $100,000? MikyBull Crypto has optimistically revealed that from late December 2024 to March 2025, investors and the broader crypto market may witness “the real fun” of the altcoin season. This suggests that the altcoin market is expected to embark on a significant rally, with numerous small-cap cryptocurrencies experiencing varying price increases.

Prominent crypto analyst CrediBULL has shared an audacious forecast on X (formerly Twitter): XRP will surpass its ATH much more quickly than most anticipate. I think $XRP is probably going to make new ATH a lot quicker than most are expecting- and I think it’s going to vastly outperform both $BTC and $ETH from current levels while doing it. XRP/ETH just reclaimed and retested a 4 year long range, with the first target being ~250%… pic.twitter.com/fLYlH2GEYB — CrediBULL Crypto (@CredibleCrypto) November 21, 2024 Surpassing Bitcoin And Ethereum The most recent performance of XRP has been nothing short of remarkable. The coin has experienced a 90% increase in value over the past 90 days, surpassing Bitcoin (up 51%) and Ethereum (up 20%). The two market leaders are expected to be outperformed by XRP, as this short-term dominance indicates a change in market dynamics. Still, there’s an issue. Bitcoin is nearing its ATH of about $99K while Ethereum is just 30% below its peak. By contrast, the crypto asset stays 60% below its six-year-old ATH. This discrepancy highlights the difficult climb XRP must do to reclaim its prior dominance even while it shows promise for development. The XRP/ETH trading pair has left a four-year range, which suggests a possible 240% increase and has added to the optimism, CrediBULL pointed out. The next major XRP advancement could be spurred on by this breakthrough. Upbeat Technical Indicators Technically, XRP is showing strong bullish signals. While important indices, such the Relative Strength Index (RSI), show reduced selling pressure, the Simple Moving Average (SMA) provides strong support for the present price trend. Over the next three months, analysts predict its price will rise by 7.3%; following six months, they expect an 80.96% rise, data from CoinCheckup shows. Related Reading: XRP Gains Momentum: Whale Activity Points To $15 Breakthrough The ability of XRP to consistently surpass resistance levels is the driving force behind these forecasts. The path to $2—and beyond—may be closer than skeptics believe if it maintains this momentum. A Market-Defining Moment The recent price fluctuations of XRP are a part of a larger narrative unfolding in the cryptocurrency market. As institutional adoption and regulation continue to expand, XRP is asserting itself as a top contender in the next wave of crypto expansion. Its current price of $1.54 reflects both a resurgence in investor confidence and a recovery from recent volatility. Meanwhile, XRP holders are on high alert watching the charts. The sentiment for XRP is undoubtedly bullish, even if the market cannot settle on anything yet. It could be the start of a greater rally if the stars align right into a new ATH.

36772207,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=654589,1732415412,"Analyst Sounds Bearish Alarm For Bitcoin As $100,000 Presents Psychological Resistance","Despite heightened expectations for the Bitcoin price to hit the $100,000 milestone, a crypto analyst has surmised that this key target could present psychological resistance for the pioneer cryptocurrency. Amidst this bearish warning, the coin’s price’s continued upward movement towards the elusive $100,000 mark has become the center of attention in the crypto community. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Mirrors 2017 Pattern, Is The Top Only 2 Weeks Away After Hitting $100,000? $100,000 Bitcoin Price As A Psychological Resistance Crypto analyst Gert van Lagen recently took to X (formerly Twitter) to announce to his 108,000 followers that the Bitcoin price is approaching the $100,000 all time high. The analyst has suggested that its climb to $100,000 would be like hitting major price levels of $10, $100, and $10,000 for the first time. According to Lagen, the $100,000 milestone is set to present a psychological resistance for Bitcoin, potentially leading to short-term price volatility. Based on the analyst’s statements, this psychological resistance could temporarily stall the crypto’s rally above $100,000. While sharing this bearish warning, Lagen also issued a bullish forecast for Bitcoin, highlighting that a surge to the target zone of $220,000 to $320,000 was likely before the global recession set in. While this prediction could be well received by BTC if it continues on its bullish momentum, the analyst has asserted that the timeline to reach these heights may be limited. In preparation for the projected Bitcoin psychological barrier, Lagen has advised crypto investors to short their BTC at the $100,000 mark. Traders who leverage this strategy will have to bet on the possibility of a price correction in Bitcoin before it experiences any significant breakout to the upside. With Bitcoin approaching the $100,000 price level, the stakes are getting higher, as analysts believe that this key milestone could serve as a launch pad to propel the cryptocurrency to a price top. For now, the price is trading at $98,560, marking a 7.63% increase in the last seven days as bullish sentiment and momentum continue to grow. Massive Liquidation To Follow If BTC Hits $100,000 Although the crypto market is anticipating Bitcoin’s price rise to $100,000, a prominent analyst has revealed that massive liquidation could be triggered once BTC reaches this fundamental level. According to Ali Martinez, $1.89 billion is set to be liquidated if Bitcoin jumps to the $100,625 level. Based on the analyst’s chart, this Bitcoin liquidation represents its “cumulative short liquidation leverage.” This analysis follows reports of a large-scale Bitcoin liquidation, as Martinez recently revealed that a whopping 65,000 BTC, valued at $6.37 billion, was withdrawn from exchanges. Related Reading: Chinese Court Declares Personal Crypto Ownership Legal In Mainland China Martinez has also revealed that Bitcoin’s TD Sequential is flashing a sell signal on its 4-hour chart. Given this, the analyst has predicted a significant correction to the $97,085 mark. On the flip side, the analyst has disclosed that if Bitcoin can hold a candlestick above $100,470, it would invalidate the bearish formation and potentially propel its price towards $102,656 or $104,343.

This surge has reignited bullish sentiment among analysts and investors, who are now closely monitoring AVAX’s potential to reach the key $50 mark in the coming days. The breakout signals a shift in market dynamics, with rising demand and growing optimism fueling the price action. Related Reading: Massive Ethereum Buying Spree – Taker Buy Volume hits $1.683B In One Hour Prominent analyst and crypto investor Kaleo shared a detailed technical analysis on X, suggesting that once AVAX surpasses the $50 level, it could trigger a massive rally. He highlighted the importance of this psychological and technical level as a gateway to exponential price growth, potentially attracting more momentum-driven buyers. Avalanche’s recent performance reflects the broader strength of the crypto market, as key altcoins experience renewed interest amid a bullish cycle. With market conditions aligning favorably, AVAX could continue its upward trajectory if it holds above its current levels. However, traders are also cautious and aware of potential profit-taking or resistance near the $50 threshold. Avalanche Prepares For A Rally Avalanche is on the verge of a massive rally, closely following a pattern reminiscent of its last bullish cycle. The price has surged above key supply levels with impressive strength and is now less than 15% away from the critical $50 mark. This level has captured the attention of both traders and analysts, as a breakout above it could signal the start of an aggressive bullish phase. Kaleo recently shared a technical analysis on X, emphasizing the importance of the $50 level. According to Kaleo, breaking this psychological and technical barrier could trigger a powerful rally, potentially doubling AVAX’s value in a short period. He also highlighted the AVAXBTC chart, which shows a similar breakout pattern, confirming the bullish sentiment surrounding Avalanche. Kaleo predicts that AVAX could reach $100 quickly if the momentum continues. Despite the optimism, the potential for a market-wide correction introduces a degree of caution. With Bitcoin showing signs of possible retracement to consolidate and gather momentum, AVAX may face temporary pullbacks. Related Reading: Bitcoin LTHs Start Taking Profits – Metrics Reveal Whales Are Actively Spending However, such corrections could present buying opportunities for those eyeing long-term gains. As Avalanche approaches this pivotal stage, investors are eager to see if it can break above the $50 level and deliver the explosive rally analysts have forecasted. AVAX Testing Fresh Supply Levels Avalanche is trading at $43.6, marking its highest price level since April following a strong breakout above key resistance around $35. This impressive price action has reignited optimism among investors and analysts, with AVAX showing resilience as it pushes toward fresh supply levels. Currently, AVAX appears poised to challenge the critical $50 mark, a psychological and technical level that could determine the next phase of its rally. However, there is a possibility that the token may consolidate below this level in the coming days. Consolidation would allow the market to absorb recent gains and build momentum for a stronger push higher.

Such a pullback would not signal a bearish trend but rather a healthy correction that could strengthen AVAX’s trajectory toward sustained growth.
