42429406,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLyXvh,1532554422,AMD Sees Q2 Drop in GPU Sales to Crypto Miners,"Chip maker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) said Wednesday that sales of graphics cards (GPUs) to cryptocurrency miners fell during the second quarter.  The company published its quarterly earnings report late Wednesday afternoon, reporting a 3 percent quarter-to-quarter decline in revenue for its Computing and Graphics segment. The unit brought in $1.09 billion, which AMD said was a 64 percent jump year-over-year. In an earnings call, CEO Lisa Su added that approximately 6 percent of AMD's revenue came from selling to crypto-miners, down from 10 percent in the first quarter.  Still, that quarterly decline was driven in part from lower revenue from what it called ""the blockchain market"" – that is, miners who use AMD's graphics cards for the energy-intensive mining process.  AMD said in its report:  ""Computing and Graphics segment revenue was $1.09 billion, up 64 percent year-over-year and down 3 percent quarter-over-quarter. Year-over-year revenue growth was driven by strong sales of Radeon products and continued growth of Ryzen products. The quarter-over-quarter decline was primarily related to lower revenue from GPU products in the blockchain market.""  Further, the GPU maker expects this trend to continue, but it anticipates that sales of other products will offset the decline.  The company expects the decline in GPU sales for crypto mining to continue, though it expects to offset the drop with sales from other products.  ""For the third quarter of 2018, AMD expects revenue to be approximately $1.7 billion, plus or minus $50 million, an increase of approximately 7 percent year-over-year, and non-GAAP gross margin to increase to approximately 38 percent, driven by the sales growth of Ryzen and EPYC products, partially offset by lower sales of GPU products in the blockchain market,"" AMD said.  During the earnings call, Su said ""we're expecting very little from blockchain"" in terms of third-quarter revenue.  ""If you update that on a full-year basis, for 2018 blockchain will be lower than what we had previously discussed in our last earnings call. Previously we said mid-to-high single digits ... but we'll watch that develop over the next two quarters,"" she said.

The FinCEN Improvement Act  (H.R. 6411), filed jointly by U.S. Congressmen Ed Perlmutter (D-CO) and Steve Pearce (R-NM) on July 18, directs FinCEN to look into how cryptocurrencies might be used in terrorism or other illegal activities, in addition to working with tribal law enforcement agencies and other terror financing schemes.  Specifically, it includes language reflecting ""matters involving emerging technologies or value that substitutes for currency, and similar efforts.""  It states:  ""Although the use and trading of virtual currencies are legal practices, some terrorists and criminals, including international criminal organizations, seek to exploit vulnerabilities in the global financial system and are increasingly using emerging payment methods such as virtual currencies to move illicit funds.""  FinCEN, which operates under the U.S. Treasury Department, is set to ""safeguard the financial system from illicit use and combat money laundering and promote national security through the collection, analysis, and dissemination of financial intelligence and strategic use of financial authorities,"" as stated on its website.  Pearce said in a news release that the new directives would ""ensure"" FinCEN's ability to ""continue their vitally important mission in the dynamic world environment.""  The proposed bill comes years after FinCEN first published guidance for money transmitters working with cryptocurrencies. Firms in the U.S. that undertake such activities are required to register with FinCEN, and more recently, the agency said that exchanges which handle tokens sold during initial coin offerings (ICOs) must also comply with its regulations.  ""This is an important step in modernizing FinCEN and ensuring our law enforcement and intelligence communities can detect and prevent criminals and terrorist networks from using virtual currencies to move illicit funds or carry out cyber warfare,"" Perlmutter said last week.

CEO Sergey Solonin told the story while speaking to students at the Moscow Advanced Communications School. Solonin – whose company has thrown its weight behind the Russian government's work with blockchain and launched its own blockchain subsidiary in March of last year – said the experience was what first introduced him to the concept, according to a transcript published on the website Rusbase.  Solonin said he discovered that one of his developers had hijacked the company's hardware to mine bitcoin when the machines were not in use. Moreover, he found that the developer had made roughly $5 million over the course of a few months – a great deal more than the company had seen in profit from the machines.  He explained:  ""I thought 'what a crazy stuff,' we're struggling to earn 3 cents on those terminals and such a gold mine is actually hidden here.""  The developer quit the firm after being asked to turn over the profit from using company property, Solonin added. While he told his remaining employees to continue mining, the network difficulty had become too great for Qiwi's hardware to handle.  Qiwi refused to disclose the name of the developer to the Russian newspaper Vedomosty, which confirmed the story with the press office.  As Solonin told the website The Bell, his understanding is that the employee in question went on to lose all their coins at a now-failed cryptocurrency exchange.

Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo was speaking before the House Committee on Agriculture, addressing questions about the agency's performance and future agenda. It was during that time that the chairman fielded a question about blockchain.  He noted that the regulator is hamstrung in certain ways – for example, Giancarlo said that the CFTC can't operate a node on a blockchain operated by a banking consortium – despite being invited to by those institutions – because the sharing of information and data is considered a gift and therefore is something the CFTC can't accept.  Similarly, the CFTC cannot purchase or rent the ability to run a node because it would require an appropriations bill through Congress. As a result, he said, ""by the time we go through all that, this thing is already launched.""  Instead, he advocated for a bill introduced by Rep. Austin Scott which would grant the regulator the ability to accept shared data – something that would give the CFTC a leg-up on the topic.  ""We're falling behind. Just two days ago the Bank of England announced that they're putting in a new bank-to-bank payment system in the UK and it's going to be blockchain-complaint,"" Giancarlo said during the hearing.  He went on to explain:  ""[The Bank of England has] had the last four years ... to participate in all these blockchain beta tests that we have not been able to participate in and they've been able to get comfortable with the technology and now they're incorporating it. I feel we're four years behind because we do need to test it, we do need to understand it so we can do a better job as regulator before I then come to Congress and say we need money to to build something.""  The ironic part, Rep. Michael Conaway quipped, is that the CFTC does have legal authority to demand information after the blockchain is launched, but current laws prevent the regulator from looking at the information prior to that point.  Giancarlo agreed, saying ""we do have subpoena authority [but] that's probably the wrong way to get involved.""  Eye on the market  Giancarlo also addressed the regulator's ability to oversee cryptocurrencies specifically, noting that the regulator is limited to commodities and futures contracts, as well as fraud and manipulation.  That being said, he added, ""the amount of ink that's devoted to [cryptocurrency] far outweighs their real role in the economy.""  He explained that the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies ""is probably less than one publicly traded company,"" adding:  ""The best model I like to point to in the 1990s when a Democrat White House and a Republican Congress worked together around this thing called the internet and took a 'first-do-no-harm' approach. Regulation came slowly and let the technology evolve.""  ""I think we need to stay close to it, we need to be careful, but I think we can let it develop a little bit before we run in with regulation,"" he concluded.

42429414,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLyYDh,1532536249,Bitcoin Price Awaits Possible Spoiler Ahead of July Futures Close,"Bitcoin traders may have their eyes on a different kind of chart this week.  That's because Friday, July 27 is the date that bitcoin futures contracts offered by derivatives giant CME Group are scheduled to expire. A financial product that lets institutions and professional traders long or short the crypto asset (betting on its future performance), history shows the price of bitcoin drops 7.89 percent on average in the five days prior to a contract expiration.  As such, data suggests the event could trigger a healthy pullback in prices for the cryptocurrency.  Still, other factors may be at play this time around. Investor interest in the bitcoin futures market is seeing substantial growth – perhaps best depicted by a tweet from the CME Group which stated that their bitcoin futures product was up 93 percent in volume and 58 percent in open interest in Q2.  CME futures continued their growth into Q3 including a record volume of contracts set this past Tuesday, equivalent to 64,390 bitcoins with a notional value of $530 million, according to another tweet from the CME Group.  While the numbers are encouraging for widespread adoption of bitcoin investment, many have argued bitcoin futures negatively impact price. Prior to the introduction of bitcoin futures, there were few options for traditional investors to short the market, and this particular investment type has accomplished just that, allowing bears to speculate alongside the bulls.  Again interest to what's ahead is that the price of bitcoin has been on the rebound over the last few weeks where at press time, bitcoin is trading at $8,182 - printing a 41 percent increase from its annual low ($5,799) set less than a month ago, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.  That said, the dramatic growth has led to overextended technical charts, including the highest daily RSI level since December, which could be a factor in helping history repeat.  Past precedent  As seen in the chart above, the price of bitcoin recorded a loss in the five days leading up to the expiry on four out of the six occasions where futures have expired.  Most notably, in the days prior to the close of the January and March contracts, price fell 13.05 and 20.45 percent respectively (closing price on expiry day subtracted from opening price of fifth day prior).  The average performance of the four negative occasions comes out to a depreciation of 12.82 percent while the remaining two occasions recorded a meager average gain of 1.69 percent.  Perhaps not coincidentally, Bitcoin reached its all-time high of $19,891 (on Bitfinex) on Dec. 17, 2017, the exact day CME introduced their first bitcoin futures product. Price has been on a steady decline ever since and figures currently reflect a 58 percent depreciation from the high mark.  While it should not come as a surprise for prices to drop in a bear market, it will be interesting to see how future's impact the price of bitcoin, if at all, if the cryptocurrency returns to its bullish glory.

Voyager, according to a report from Fortune, is founded by the co-founder of Uber, Oscar Salazar, as well as one of the ride-hailing app's early investors, Philip Eytan. Voyager's CEO is Stephen Ehrlich, the former CEO and founder of retail brokerage Lightspeed Financial, who also previously ran the professional trading arm for online stock broker E*Trade before it was bought by Lightspeed.  The focus on no-fee trading is a notable one, putting Voyager in the same class as trading app Robinhood – that is, seeking to upend the market's status quo by stripping away some of the costs associated with trading cryptocurrencies.  To start, Voyager plans to list 15 cryptocurrencies, drawn from the list of the 25 best-performing networks, including bitcoin, ethereum and bitcoin cash, among others.  Ehrlich told Fortune that Voyager is ""leaning towards"" including such cryptocurrencies as XRP and Stellar's lumens at present.  ""If you see it being traded today by some of the most prominent players, we will definitely have those plus some,"" Ehrlich said.  Beta testing of the platform begins this week, the company told Fortune, and traders will be able to download the exchange's app by the end of October. Voyager also intends to add support for crypto news and analysis, as well as additional tools for the institutional investor segment.  According to Voyager, the exchange is in the process of securing licenses in U.S. states. ""We don't think crypto has been adopted yet by the masses in the United States,"" Ehrlich was quoted as saying.

According to the announcement:  ""We believe that joining the TRON network will further enhance BitTorrent and accelerate our mission of creating an Internet of options, not rules.""  News of the imminent purchase became public in mid-June, when BitTorrent co-founder and former president Ashwin Navin told CoinDesk that Tron was forking out $120 million for the firm.  The news provoked speculation that after the merger BitTorrent might start charging users with fees in cryptocurrency. However, as reported, the firm wrote on its website that it has ""no plans to change"" its business model and will not charge fees for any of its services. Further, BitTorrent indicated it has ""no plans to enable mining of cryptocurrency now or in the future.""  According to a report in Variety at the time, TRON founder Justin Sun began negotiating the acquisition of BitTorrent last September under a ""no shop"" clause, which prevented BitTorrent from discussing possible mergers with other potential buyers. However, on May 25, BitTorrent reportedly violated that clause and Sun filed legal paperwork to sue. The fate of that lawsuit is unknown.  Tron's TRX blockchain-based token is now the 11th largest cryptocurrency with a $2.4 billion market capitalization, according to price data provider CoinMarketCap.

42429410,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLyY3h,1532525403,China's Answer to Reddit Is Launching a Crypto Token,"One of the oldest and most popular social networking platforms in China is launching its own crypto token in an apparent bid to boost declining user activity.  Tianya Club, an internet forum founded in 1999, announced on Wednesday it will launch the blockchain-based Tianyan Token (TYT) on Aug. 8 as a way to reward original content contributions and participation in community activities. It will also serve as a means of exchange and payments.  With a hard-cap of 90 billion tokens to be created, Tianya said 20 percent of the total will be reserved for its operational teams, while the remaining 80 percent will be distributed to community members.  So far, Tianya has not disclosed what platform its blockchain is built on, nor is it clear if TYTs will be subsequently tradeable on third-party exchanges or how its value will be determined.  Today's launch also appears to be boosting the firm's non-blockchain token – Tianya Diamond –which was launched by the firm in late 2017, just a few months after China explicitly banned companies from soliciting Chinese residents over blockchain-related tokens.  According to today's announcement, only users who hold a certain amount of Tianya Diamonds can receive TYT tokens by participating in certain community activities such as moderating threads.  Tianya Diamond was revealed in December as a centrally issued utility token for collectibles and gifting, with the firm promising ""more use cases in the future."" With a hard-cap of 900 million, Tianya Diamond can be purchased using Chinese yuan on WeChat.  For users who hope to earn TYTs by contributing original content, the total of any reward depends on the numbers votes received from other users who hold TYTs.  The move appears to be an attempt by the internet forum to revitalize its community after a decline in profits amid decreasing popularity.

The privacy-focused cryptocurrency joins a number of major crypto assets on the startup's platform, which offers a multi-signature wallet and custodial products and services for users that include institutional clients. Just last week, the company also added support for 57 ethereum-based tokens, as reported by CoinDesk.  Clients will be able to store zcash in both BitGo's multi-signature wallets and its cold-storage custody solutions, according to the firm.  BitGo chief technical officer Ben Chan told CoinDesk that ""zcash is a natural fit for BitGo as both are focused on privacy protection, security and cutting-edge technology."" The cryptocurrency also comes to the platform following expressions of interest from institutional clients, he added.  Zcash engineer Brad Miller said in a statement that BitGo support will enable investors to ""seamlessly send and receive zcash in a safe and secure way,"" in particular due the institutional-grade security standards the firm employs.  ""The Zcash Company ecosystem team and BitGo worked collaboratively to ensure Zcash is well integrated and supported,"" he said.  Chan also indicated that the firm's addition of new cryptos will continue apace, with BitGo planning to list more than 100 tokens by the end of 2018.  As previously reported, BitGo filed for a charter to build its own regulated asset custody service. It is unclear yet when the BitGo Trust may open for business, but marketing vice president Clarissa Horowitz told CoinDesk in May that the startup is working with regulators on the process.

42429413,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLyYFh,1532518210,Bitcoin Seeks Bargain Buyers As Price Retreats Back Toward $8K,"Bitcoin's (BTC) price has seen a $350 drop this morning from Tuesday's two-month highs and may be headed for a short-term correction, technical charts suggest.  As of writing, the leading cryptocurrency is trading at $8,220 on Bitfinex down 3.5 percent from the high of $8,507 reached yesterday.  Today's dip is not surprising and could be extended further as BTC's 40 percent rally from the seven-month low of $5,755 reached on June 24 is still looking overstretched, as per the relative strength index (RSI).  The short duration charts have also aligned in favor of a deeper correction.  However, the bullish reversal has likely revved up investor interest and bargain hunters who missed out on lower prices prior to the rally could step in prevent significant losses.  Hourly chart  The 50-hour, 100-hour, and 200-hour moving averages (MAs) are trending north and are located one above the other, indicating the path of least resistance is to the upside. Consequently, these MAs could be the area of interest of the bargain hunter.  As of writing, the 50-hour MA is located at $8,023.  Meanwhile, the 100-hour MA, currently located at $7,736, almost coincides with the rising trendline, thus dip demand could be strong around that level.  Daily chart  The rising (bullish) 5-day MA and 10-day MA are located at $7,830 and $7,538, respectively. The 100-day MA, which acted as a stiff resistance last week, is seen offering strong support at $7,612.  Clearly, the area between the $7,830 and $7,530 is packed with key moving average lines and could act as a strong support zone.  View  BTC is feeling the pull of gravity, courtesy of overbought conditions and a bearish RSI divergence on the hourly chart.  Bargain hunters could hit the markets with fresh bids around $8,023 (50-hour MA). A violation there would allow a retreat to the strong support zone of $7,530–$7,830.  Should a strong dip demand emerge around the above discussed key levels, then BTC could cross the all-important 200-day MA hurdle of $8,633 in a convincing manner.  The short-term outlook remains bullish as long as the 5-day and 10-day MAs are rising.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

42429415,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLyYHh,1532512840,CoinDesk Releases Q2 2018 State of Blockchain Report,"To use crypto parlance, the second quarter was a painful time if you were HODLing – but a productive one if you were BUIDLing.  That's perhaps the biggest takeaway from CoinDesk's State of Blockchain Q2 2018 report.  For a second straight quarter, the major blockchains racked up negative market indicators. Most of these downtrends were around exchange activity, with volumes down for most trade pairs. Yet outside of exchange numbers, usage and developer work charged forward, with milestones achieved around both bitcoin and ethereum.  Released today, the State of Blockchain report provides a 100+ slide analysis of industry news and data. It covers market interest in public blockchains with a snapshot of the ten largest compared to bitcoin at the end of the quarter.  The report also features a deep dive into the quarterly interest around bitcoin and ethereum, followed by news and data that highlight developments around trading, ICOs, SAFTs, venture capital, distributed ledger technology (DLT), security breaches, 51% attacks, regulations, litigation, corporate developments, employment, and a close look at EOS's year-long ICO and the subsequent launch of the EOS blockchain.  Finally, the report shares the results of our 60+ question sentiment survey of over 1,200 Coindesk readers.  Here are a few key takeaways from the report:  Bitcoin  Bitcoin trading activity on exchanges dipped over the quarter, with a weighted combination of crypto-to-crypto volumes, fiat-to-crypto volumes and total trade pairs down 26 percent. The use of bitcoin's blockchain to transact on-chain also saw less interest in Q2, declining 28 percent. Miner revenues (-22 percent) and fees (-19 percent) dropped as well.  Hashrate – the amount of computing power spent making it costly to reverse transactions, a key measure of blockchain security – bucked this trend, but with slowed growth (+26 percent in Q2 compared to +47 percent in Q1).  Yet while bitcoin's bear market continued, development activity carried on without distractions.  Hidden behind the negative trend in the use of bitcoin's blockchain was important development news: part of the reason why on-chain transactions fell was because of the lightning network's growth.  Indeed, the use of payment channels – in which small, frequent transactions between two parties are conducted off-chain and the blockchain is reserved for final settlement – boomed in Q2 as the lightning network pushes its solution to certain scaling issues.  The rest of the industry largely followed bitcoin's script. Exchange activity around ether (ETH), the native currency of the ethereum network, was down 37 percent. Ethereum's blockchain was used at about the same levels as Q1, which itself was a record-setting quarter. However, mining revenues surged 22 percent, with the equivalent of over $1.1 billion paid to miners, just $300 million less than bitcoin's mining revenues for the quarter.  More significant events happened beyond ethereum's network and exchange interests. On the regulatory front, ETH finally received some clarity: an official of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission declared that ETH, in its present form, was a not a security after all.  Perhaps more important than regulatory clarity, a clear picture of ethereum's development roadmap emerged.  Vitalik Buterin shared details on the scaling solution known as sharding and more about the future of ethereum with several posts, along with the following illustration on Twitter.  Investments in the industry continued to boom, with notable increase in the size of fundraising for projects, as well as in the sophistication of how the offerings are structured.  Average ICO size has steadily grown from $6 million in Q3 2017 to $16 million in Q4 to $31 million in Q1 2018 to $39 million in Q2 2018. The numbers in Q1 and Q2 were boosted by the back-to-back mega ICOs of Telegram ($1.7 billion) in Q1 and EOS ($4.2 billion) in Q2.  However, it's important to note that total ICOs closed per month plateaued after their late 2017 peak, so larger rounds were raised from fewer total projects. These trends, taken together, perhaps suggest the start of a winner-take-all environment where large projects attract most of the invested funds.  The legal sophistication of some ICOs grew as well. New legal structures allowed accredited investors to potentially combine the traditional legal infrastructure of registered securities with some features of a crypto ICO by using Simple Agreements for Future Tokens (SAFTs).  Data from the SEC's EDGAR database revealed that 37 companies filed documents containing the phrase ""Simple Agreements for Future Tokens."" Those SAFTs raised a combined $304 million over the three-month period.  Our own survey managed to uncover a peculiarity amongst people who follow bitcoin closely.  The 21e8 mystery, in which one improbable bitcoin hash seemed to hint at an otherworldly authority, came as the quarter ended. In the sentiment survey, we asked readers which of several explanations for the phenomenon they agreed with.  A plurality of our 1200+ respondents said they believed it was a coincidence that the apparent references to bitcoin's 21 million supply cap and the physics theory known as E8 had appeared in the hash. Another 25 percent had no idea what the question was about.  The peculiarity was that while only 3 percent said time travel was the explanation, it was still a percentage point more than those who believed bitcoin was hacked (2 percent).  While responses to this question can be taken as tongue-in-cheek, it says something that more people in the community consider time travel a plausible possibility than a successful hacking of bitcoin.  These stories and more are available in our comprehensive report on a busy quarter for the industry.  Data and analysis provided by Peter Ryan and Adam Hart.

Pretty much everyone saw them coming, but it was no less disturbing when assassination markets actually began to appear on Augur, a decentralized protocol for betting on the outcomes of real-world events and that launched two weeks ago on ethereum.  The markets – which allow users to bet on the fates of prominent politicians, entrepreneurs and celebrities – in some cases explicitly specify assassination, as the quote above shows. (CoinDesk is intentionally not providing links to these markets or naming the individuals concerned.)  In addition to targeting individuals, some markets offer bets on whether mass shootings and terrorist attacks with certain minimum numbers of casualties will occur.  Augur was created by the Forecast Foundation and funded through an ICO in 2015. It is an uncensorable platform where users can create prediction markets based on the outcome of any verifiable event, from World Cup games to elections to cryptocurrency prices to the weather.  Augur became one of the most popular applications on ethereum shortly after launch. At the time of writing, it has nearly $1.5 million staked on over 600 markets, according to Predictions.Global, a site that displays data on Augur markets (and has censored the assassination markets).  Since Augur consists of smart contracts on ethereum, a blockchain network that is not controlled by any single party, users from around the world can place bets on its prediction markets – without governments being able to stop them.  This quality appeals to gamblers in jurisdictions where sports betting isn't allowed. It could also appeal to people who want to incentivize – or simply purchase – the assassination of a public figure.  By creating a market for an assassination and placing a large ""no"" bet (actually, selling shares in the outcome), an individual or group could in effect place a bounty on the targeted person. The would-be assassin could then place a bet on ""yes"" (buy shares) and manipulate the outcome, to put it delicately.  What's next?  Long before the first assassination markets appeared, users on Augur community forums frequently discussed their eventual creation, as well as potential responses by the community and the authorities.  One response would be for Augur's ""reporters"" – the users designated by market creators to determine the outcome of the event being wagered on – to step in and quash the markets.  ""The Augur Reporter community has a powerful tool in their ability to mark a market as 'invalid,'"" said Predictions.Global co-founder Ryan Berckmans.  Holders of Augur's ""reputation"" or REP token could dispute the decision to call these markets invalid, Berckmans continued. In other words, they could insist that the markets be settled (users bet in and are paid out in ether, not REP tokens).  But ultimately, he added, reporters ""are incentivized to report in a way with which they expect the REP-holding community will agree."" In other words, it's up to token holders' consensus to decide whether taking out life insurance on other people is acceptable on Augur.  That opens the possibility that Augur could fork into two platforms, one – call it Augur Dark – that tolerates assassination markets, and one that doesn't. The white paper describes the procedure for forking when REP holders cannot agree on how to report an event.  Judging by Reddit commentary, the consensus appears to be that incentivizing murder is ""100 percent immoral.""  Then again, one user wrote: ""I think you're overestimating the number of people who would seriously put money down to see another person killed unless said person REALLY did something nasty and wasn't going to be brought to justice otherwise.""  No control  Another potential route to shutting down the death markets appears to have closed. Augur's developers announced Monday night that they had given up ownership over the ""escape hatch"" function, which would allow a designated party to shut the system down.  ""If the Forecast Foundation is compromised by a state agency,"" Micah Zoltu, a developer who has worked on the platform, remarked, ""the system can't be turned off.""  In other words, governments may not be able to threaten Augur's creators with prosecution in order to alter or shut the platform down (they could of course threaten them with prosecution anyway).  The individuals facing the most immediate legal risks may be the users who created these assassination markets. Someone, according to a person with close knowledge of Augur, used a wallet funded through Binance, an exchange, to set one market up.  They can almost certainly be traced and identified, the person added.

Based on information provided by WeGift's website, gift cards purchased by cryptocurrencies can be used in over 120 retailers that accept WeGift, including Tesco, M&S, Uber, Carrefour, Google Play and Costa.  The service is so far only available in the U.K., France, Spain, the Netherlands and Italy.

42429403,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLyXth,1532498435,Japanese Crypto Exchanges Push for Limit on Margin Trading Borrowing,"A self-regulatory organization formed by cryptocurrency exchanges in Japan is proposing a limit on how much investors can borrow when margin trading.  According to a report from Jiji Press on Tuesday, the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association (JVCEA) has suggested domestic trading platforms enforce a restriction that investors can only borrow up to four times their deposit.  The JVCEA said the proposed plan aims to protect domestic investors because there are currently no market rules governing the upper limit of how much cryptocurrency investors can borrow in margin trading.  According to statistics released by Japan's market watchdog the Financial Services Agency (FSA) in April, there were around 142,000 crypto traders focused on derivatives in 2017, comprising a small fraction of the total 3 million traders in Japan.  However, over 80 percent of the entire cryptocurrency trading volume in the country in 2017 came from derivatives trading, which recorded $543 billion last year. And more than 90 percent of that was from margin traders.  Formed by Japanese crypto exchanges in a response to a heist on the Coincheck platform early this year, the JVCEA seeks to impose self-regulatory rules in a bid to create a healthy cryptocurrency trading market. It is now planning to submit the proposal to the FSA to get the regulator's endorsement for a potential wider implementation.  That said, the association indicated the new rule could lead to crypto investors' departure from exchanges. As such, it aims to add measures gradually and would allow exchanges to independently set their own limits.

42429407,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLyY1h,1532491200,Ethereum's Vision for Apps Is Only Growing Bolder,"Borderless, permissionless and free from coercion.  That's the dream underlying web 3.0, in which unstoppable, decentralized applications (dapps) combine with web 2.0 technology, eventually corroding the power structures that traditional infrastructures encode. But that vision hasn't come as fast as some expected or hoped, and moreover, some ethereum applications seem to even be working against that rosy vision for the future.  Outpacing CryptoKitties in cumulative volume, dapps like FOMO3D and POWH3D are leading the polls right now with high-risk gambling games that, as detailed by CoinDesk, are essentially Ponzi schemes in structure.  Larry Cermak, an analyst, described the situation on Sunday as ""depressing.""  ""Legitimate use cases like [decentralized exchanges] and prediction markets are not gaining any traction while scams and useless games are thriving,"" Cermak tweeted.  And still what proved to be ethereum's ""killer use case"" across the past two years (culminating a total of nearly $20 billion), the initial coin offering or ICO also left a stain on ethereum's history. According to one study, a whopping 78 percent of ICO's in 2017 are now ""identified scams.""  Perhaps unsurprisingly then, projects that overemphasized the crypto funding scheme were turned away from attending last week's Dappcon conference in Berlin, where the focus was on the underlying technology.  ""The focus should be on the building part, not on the raising money part,"" Alex Van de Sande, developer of ethereum's mist browser and ethereum core developer, told CoinDesk. ""I think if you focus too much on raising money to build stuff then you might not be the guys who are actually building, right.""  As such, the conference brought together developers and high-profile dapp projects to reinforce their goal and determine what needs to be done to make that goal a reality.  Because according to many at the event, dapps are still the key technology for moving ethereum and the blockchain industry as a whole closer to its dream of making the world a better, more free place.  Gregor Zavcer from Datafund, a blockchain-based project for allowing web users to take back control of their data, told CoinDesk:  ""I think the dapp development is a new paradigm in terms of how you do everything in the open, how you connect with others, and how you also provide value, not just necessarily for the end user but for the ecosystem.""  Ambition meets reality  And those things, according to Van de Sande, are the essence of ethereum.  ""Ethereum makes no sense if there are no dapps; if there are no dapps running on ethereum then it's just another coin that gets its worth from speculating,"" he told CoinDesk.  And as such, ""I think our job, as ethereum developers, is to try to understand what are the dapps doing and what are the dapps not doing, what are the biggest challenges for those dapps, and we need to solve that for them. We serve the dapp developers.""  Yet borderless communication, trade, computation and organizations – there's a known disconnect between the technologically ambitious dapp community and ethereum's ability to handle a fully decentralized dapp that has mainstream use.  For example, CryptoKitties was lambasted when it was first launched since it garnered significant traction and caused transaction backlogs and increasing fees on the network.  Then later, it was criticized for sacrificing full decentralization for the sake of usability. And this tension between usability and decentralization – manifest by the lack of user engagement on most dapps so far – was the most troubling concern for those at Dappcon.  Benjamin Bollen from OpenST, a layer-two scaling solution for ethereum crypto tokens, said that the need for user engagement even eclipses the platform's need to scale to keep up with market demand.  Bollen said:  ""I had to be told this many many times by business people – as a technology nerd – to really absorb this message: We need to actually get to a point where it has real value and it only has real value if there are actually hundreds of millions of people using this technology.""  He continued, saying that ethereum has piqued interest from time to time – during the ICO boom, to name one – and it's up to the developers to make sure what ethereum is known for isn't vaporware.  Live and invaluable  While the dapps eliciting the most conversation right now are those that most developers disregard, still there have been a number of announcements and launches this year displaying that ethereum dapps are making headway.  For instance, Golem, a decentralized computation market, launched into beta earlier this year, while the hotly anticipated prediction market Augur has been live and functioning rather well for the past two weeks.  Mobile ethereum client Status, that runs over decentralized, encrypted chat protocol Whisper, has also made substantial progress. As well as enabling transactions to occur across the chat app, Status provides an early look at some of the more exciting possibilities of the decentralized web – peer-to-peer token swaps, DAO creation apps, identity systems, social networks, collectibles and Local Ethereum.  And for some, these features are invaluable. Because Status offers a free method for communication for those who live behind strict internet firewalls and cannot access conventional social media websites, the dapp has become one that many ethereum developers point to as not just a success, but a necessity.  Speaking to that Status use case, María Paula Fernandez, communications lead for decentralized computation app Golem, said:  ""We don't realize this shit, but this is the power of a dapp. Dapps are fucking alive.""  And according to Zavcer, typical of the dapp ecosystem is that protocols overlap and reinforce each other.  ""These past two days I was reminded about the notion of 'team protocols,'"" Zavcer told CoinDesk. ""Teams are specializing on the aspect that they want to cover and somehow together we create these decentralized mosaics.""  Echoing that, Anna Rose, co-host of the ZeroKnowledge podcast, which takes a look at the technology that'll power web 3.0, told CoinDesk:  ""I think when there is a momentum in a scene – be it music, art or tech – you see a flourishing of ideas, buzz around certain terms. New humor, aesthetics and memes emerge. It is an exciting moment.""  Bad dapps do good?  Part of the new ""humor"" – a dark humor –that's emerging from the ethereum dapp ecosystem is the concept of honesty in your bad behavior making that bad behavior somehow charming.  For instance, the Ponzi scheme games, FOMO3D and POWH3D, have several fans. One Twitter user said of FOMO3D, ""Deadly combination of smart contract and psychology. Like bitconnect but honest. Simply genius.""  But overall, ethereum dapps developers have come out to criticize the games, contending that the only reason they are popular and causing a stir within the community is that they are easy builds that aren't technologically complex, so work can go into marketing instead of development.  ""Bad dapps are popular because they are the easiest to build, and due to the newness still of this technology and hype, people see dollar signs,"" Fauve Altman, community manager for dapp registry and analytics site, State of the Dapps, told CoinDesk.  That said, the team behind FOMO3D and POWH3D emphasized their shared commitment to a decentralized web.  ""Most of the crypto sector is nothing but unsubstantiated hype, a melting pot of impractical ideas fueled by psychologically manipulative marketing, greed and deceit. Like it or not, this is the reality of not just crypto but the majority of capitalism as a whole,"" Mantso, the pseudonymous lead developer behind the games, told CoinDesk.  While the statements could be taken as tongue-in-cheek, Mantso could be onto something in that any kind of development in the field will provide the much-needed research to make the vision a reality – one that doesn't accidentally cause harm.  As such, Mantso, rather optimistically, concluded:  ""All of you are pioneers in a completely new, disruptive economic field that will undoubtedly come to flourish. This community is the breeding ground, the nurturing womb for the first, true decentralized society and economy.""
