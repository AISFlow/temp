Gox has announced some new updates and features to its platform including a one-time password (OTP) card.  This battery-powered password generator is linked to a user's account, and can be used for an additional layer of security, either by storing a unique password or generating a new one every time a user performs actions such as logging in or initiating a withdrawal online.  The card costs $39.99 and is shipping now. For more information about the Mt. Gox OTP card, the exchange has produced a resource guide.  Mt. Gox has also announced increased SEPA withdrawal limits from its European bank, based in Poland. No exact amount is specified, only that the bank has ""doubled our limit,"" according to the exchange's press releasehttps://www.mtgox.com/press_release_20131120.html.  Additionally, a modified trading interface has been released. Earlier this year, Mt. Gox had announced it was partnering with Akamai in order to speed up its performance. This new update appears to be more on the cosmetic side; with color indicators for buy and sell actions and more details regarding transaction fees at the time of a trade.  The exchange also is now requiring all BTC transfers to pay a 0.001 BTC network fee. Previously, Mt. Gox only required this to speed up transaction times from one bitcoin wallet to another.  One of the earliest exchange sources for obtaining bitcoins and at one time this year the largest, Mt. Gox has been riddled with problematic issues. The gamut ranges from DDoS attacks, banking delays and even the seizure of some of its funds by the US government.  Some of these problems have caused Mt. Gox to tumble from its number one bitcoin exchange ranking, a spot currently owned by BTC China.  Mt. Gox has also announced that for Black Friday, and through to Cyber Monday at the beginning of next week, there will be no transaction fees for buying or selling bitcoins on its platform.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | SPONSORED | TRADING,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/11/28/bitcoin-exchange-mt-gox-adds-extra-security-with-one-time-password-card,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/860ea26104c049365fa0f2b52c64038894f2cac2-1024x768.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376741,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6cpB7,1385664300,BitPesa Uses Bitcoin to Slash Kenyan Remittance Costs,"BitPesa.co, a new global remittance company servicing Kenya's ever-expanding population, is planning to use bitcoin.  The company is targeting Kenya’s $1.17bn annual remittance market by offering a 3% cut-rate fee on all transfers, Bloomberg Businessweek reported today.  Bitpesa  ’s CEO Elizabeth Rossiello said the new service is aiming to gain 1% of Kenya's remittance market within a year of launching in March 2014: a figure that will equate to roughly 6,500 transactions per month.  According to Rossiello: ""There are no other market entrants trying to solve the problem of the very high cost of remittances in Africa.”  Additionally, a report published by the World Bank back in January, titled Send Money Africa states that sending money to Kenya costs ""about 9.2% of the value of the transfer"". This is lower than the 11.89% average for remitting cash to African countries, but higher than the global average of 8.96%.  A serious contender  The report also reveals that African migrants often only have access to banks in order to make their remittances. These banks can charge as much as 19.8% and Western Union and MoneyGram international both charge rates as high as 9.2% on international transfers.  This makes BitPesa a serious contender in both the East African and global remittance spaces.  A different study conducted by the World Bank in 2010 reports that Western Union currently leads the remittance market in Kenya.  The company controls around 31% of the total market, with commercial banks accounting for 50% (of which, Barclays and Equity Bank Ltd lead the field with a 14% market share each). MoneyGram accounts for about 6%.  The World Bank also reported that “the region is the world’s most expensive for remittances because of factors such as limited competition and regulatory barriers"". It compares unfavourably with Saudi Arabia and the UAE, where the costs of remittance is as low as 4.7% and 3.5% respectively.  The report also noted that a reduction to 5% ""would be ideal"" as it would add money to the budgets of millions of African families who survive on remittances sent from relatives abroad.  BitPesa is reported to be talking to two Kenyan commercial banks and one Kenyan telecom provider.  Mobile payments  The mobile digital currency payments network in Kenya is more advanced than in any other nation, with Safaricom's M-Pesa currently servicing as much as 80% of the population and three other mobile payment networks (Airtel Kenya Ltd, Essar Telecoms Kenya Ltd and Telkom Kenya Ltd) providing similar services.  Recently, Kipochi announced that they would be providing M-Pesa users with a bitcoin wallet for their mobile phones in a move that may enable the Bitcoin protocol to unify competing private currencies Airtel Money, YuCash and Orange Money with M-Pesa under a common framework.  BitPesa's Nihal Majok said that BitPesa effectively allows users to ""buy bitcoin locally so they won't even see that it's bitcoin per se, but it will be the trading platform behind it. It will be the transmission mechanism"". At the other end, BitPesa will effectively let people cash out their bitcoins at a local shop and convert their money back into the local currency afterwards.  Sarah Wanga, a research analyst at Nairobi's ICEA Lion Group, said people feel safe putting money in banks because that's what they're familiar with, however, she believes that if this ""new system markets itself right, makes itself a household name, and it's cheaper, I think it could become a threat"".  Massimo Cirasino, manager of the Financial Infrastructure and Remittances Service at the World Bank said in a recent statement that ""governments should implement policies to open the remittances market up to competition"" and the East African Community is currently working on a system to ""harmonise money transfer systems and regulations within the region"".  Total remittances to Africa were estimated at around $60bn last year, so bitcoin could gain a real boost if it is able to tap into not only the market in Kenya, but the continent as a whole.

42376745,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6cpIf,1385662511,Litecoin Price Surges Almost 400% in 3 Days to $48,"It's not just the price of bitcoin that's gone through the roof this week, the price of another cryptocurrency – litecoin – has rocketed too.  Over the past three days the price of litecoin increased 395%, from $9.7 on 25th November to $48 at 12:00 GMT today, according to dc-charts.comhttp://dc-charts.com/chart_ltc.php?cu=1, which is based on data from the exchange BTC-e.  Since then, the price has dipped to a still-respectable $42.7 which, for reference, is what 0.04 BTC would cost you at the moment, according to the CoinDesk BPI.  There are currently just over 23,424,790 litecoins in circulation, so the recent price increase has brought the market cap of litecoins to over $1bn.  The origins  Litecoin was created by Charles Lee, brother of BTC China's CEO Bobby Lee, as an alternative to bitcoin. It's based on the Bitcoin protocol, but it differs in that it can still be efficiently mined using consumer-grade hardware. Bitcoins, however, are now largely mined by ASIC machines that have been purpose built to do just that.  That's not to say that such machines won't be created to do the same for litecoin. In fact, Lee thinks there's a strong possibility of this happening.  ""Currently, some think that Litecoin is more fair because there’s no Litecoin ASIC but it may just be a matter of time,” he told CoinDesk in an earlier interview.  Another positive feature about litecoin is that transactions are confirmed faster than they are with bitcoin (around 2.5mins compared with around 8mins).  Cause of the spike  Members of reddit's litecoin forum have been discussing why they think the price of litecoin has increased so dramatically over the past few days.  One forum member believes the sudden interest in litecoin was caused by a tweet by political pundit and financial broadcaster Max Keiser, speculating that the price of the digital currency would increase to $50.  Litecoin ($12) is up more than 100% since we recommended it last week. We are sticking to our $50 interim target.— Max Keiser (@maxkeiser) November 25, 2013    Others believe the spike was caused by low exchange rates between bitcoin and litecoin, so people have been using their BTC riches to buy cheap LTC.  Another argument is that people feel they have somewhat missed the boat when it comes to bitcoin. They saw people become millionaires on the few dollars they spent on BTC, so they've now invested in LTC just in case history repeats itself.  Regardless of the cause, litecoin's price increase is impressive, and Lee hopes this will continue.  “Litecoin is two years behind bitcoin in terms of our adoption, so it’s interesting to look into the future,” he said.  “If we don’t screw it up, litecoin will follow on the coattails of bitcoin. There will be more merchant adoption, and it will become less speculative and more useful,"" he concluded.",POSITIVE,BTC | LTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | LTC | TRADING,Emily Spaven,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/11/28/litecoin-price-surges-almost-400-in-3-days-to-48,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5240e33211b302a479fba011e10aff103823a52d-1000x662.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376744,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6cpHP,1385652487,CoinMap: Bitcoin-Accepting Merchants Increased 81% in November,"The number of physical locations that accept bitcoin has rocketed, according to statistics from Coinmap.org's crowdsourced map.  At the start of November, the number of entries on CoinMap stood at 552. This has nearly doubled to just over 1,000 current entries. The graph below, based on statistics collected by CoinMap contributor Rene-Lee Sylvain, shows the number of CoinMap entries from the end of October to 27th November.  These statistics are based on the map's total number of entries, which is displayed publicly on the site. Sylvain said:  ""When I found CoinMap, there was hardly anything there. Now, for the next wave of people, they can go to a place and spend bitcoin. Their first introduction to bitcoin will be an in-person transaction.""  CoinMap was launched in April by Pavol Rusnak (known as stick on the Bitcoin Talk forum) who is also working on the hardware bitcoin wallet Trezor.  All entries on CoinMap are crowdsourced: added either by users who are interested in populating the map, or by bitcoin merchants themselves. For example, a recent addition to CoinMap was VJLoops, a design studio in Valencia. The studio started accepting bitcoins a month ago.  ""I believe [CoinMap] is useful, but at the moment it's too early to tell if customers have found me [using CoinMap],"" said Kyle Lyons, VJLoops' owner.  Sylvain contacted Rusnak in September, taking it upon himself to promote the site on bitcoin forums and meet-ups in Vancouver. According to him, there were around 200 entries in September.  The number of entries on CoinMap began growing rapidly in October and this has continued into November, Sylvain said. He added:  ""[The growth] is obviously because of the recent rally [in bitcoin price] and US senate hearing. In general, CoinMap is being used as a kind of central map.""  CoinMap's interface is minimalist. The navigational tools only allow users to move around or zoom in and out of the map. Additionally, there is no search field for specific cities or countries. Instead, users must move the map to their desired location to find businesses that accept bitcoin there.  When the magnification level is sufficiently low, cities will display a green circle that totals the number of entries in that city. Once this circle is clicked, a fairly slick animation increases magnification to reveal all the entries within that city.  Each entry is denoted by a bitcoin icon. If an entry is clicked, a dialogue bubble appears displaying the name of the business, its website and phone number.  In keeping with bitcoin's open-source ethos, CoinMap is built in OpenStreetMap, a free open-source map of the world. Additionally, CoinMap's source code is viewable at Githubhttps://github.com/prusnak/coinmap, so it's available for anyone to work on.  Five contributors have worked on the code so far, although the vast majority of CoinMap's code has been written by Rusnak. Rusnak said that CoinMap may be monetised in future.  ""I have some ideas for monetization and I realize that CoinMap could be improved significantly if we could afford an extra developer to work on it,"" he said.  CoinMap alternatives  Several other maps containing information on physical locations where bitcoin can be spent already exist. According to the Bitcoin Wikihttps://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Real_world_shops, there are 11 alternatives to CoinMap. One of the most popular alternatives on R/Bitcoin is useBitcoins.info, which boasts 1,412 entries to date.  Unlike CoinMap, useBitcoins.info is built on Google Maps, the search giant's proprietary map platform. The site also carries banner advertisements, although it's unclear if it charges for them. The site's owner has not yet responded to an email seeking clarification at presstime.  Sylvain is an employee at Paradox BTC, a bitcoin exchange based in British Columbia, Canada. He found his way into bitcoin after two years working in a Canadian oil field, operating drilling equipment on the rig. He commented:  ""I studied computer science; I graduated into a recession, so I ended up going to work in the oil fields. It's exhausting work but you do earn a lot of money.""  Sylvain spent his time in the oil fields researching Tesla Motors, eventually buying stock and turning a profit which he then ploughed into bitcoin.  ""CoinMap doesn't look that good, but it's simple. People go on it, look for a place, and there's nothing else they do,"" he said. ""It's probably the optimal way because it's so simple right now.""",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | TRADING,Joon Ian Wong,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/11/28/coinmap-bitcoin-accepting-merchants-increased-81-in-november,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/02484ccb10640a468a9d5ffcf7c2c49b33ea55ec-754x388.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376739,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6cpCN,1385649049,10 BTC Reward Offered for Fix of Bitcoin Wallet Bug on Macs,"The core developers behind bitcoin and litecoin are offering a reward of 10 BTC, plus 200.2 LTC to anyone who can solve the bug currently plaguing wallets on Mac-based systems.  The issue is linked to the database on wallet software known as the LevelDB key store. This database is used to store information related to the block chain, a ledger for virtual currencies and a standard component of natively installed Bitcoin-Qt wallets.  Hosted wallets, which are generally web-based or mobile-based and work on multiple platforms, are more user-friendly and do not suffer from this issue.  Bitcoin and litecoin developer Warren Togami recently told ZDNet:  ""Bounties of this type are rarely offered. In this case, it is happening due to the sense that the issue is critical enough to slow down adoption of bitcoin.""  With the valuation of bitcoin ever-rising, a bitcoin and litecoin bounty will raise the stakes, according to Ankur Nandwani, a developer who has built an open bitcoin microtransaction platform called BitMonet.  ""It is interesting that with the rapid rise in [bitcoin and litecoin] price, the bounty is now worth $15k. I think the combination of this bug and the volatility in bitcoin price can have negative impact on bitcoin adoption,"" he said.  In detail, LevelDB is a key/value system developed by Google. It is not a relational database; rather, it has been designed as a string-keys-to-string-values database. The problem at hand is the periodic corruption of this database on Mac OS X.  It seems corruption occurs after the Bitcoin-Qt client is shut down and restarted. Reports indicate that corruption occurs in the Mac OS X 10.8.x and 10.9 versions, commonly known as 'Mountain Lion' and 'Mavericks'.  In the grand scheme of things, this is not a problem that could thwart the growing rise of these separate, but seemingly intertwined, virtual currencies. However, this could prove to be an issue for many individual users. Nandwani commented:  ""While the database is being rebuilt, the user is blocked from even making a transaction. So, you could think of this being a denial-of-service attack.""  A cog in the the machine of these distributed monetary systems could pose a threat that should not be dismissed.  Namecoin, a competitor to bitcoin and litecoin, had a substantial security flaw that allowed people to perform a hostile takeover of its .bit domains.  There is a proposed solution to the problem, with test builds available. The problem appears to have to do with a particular process that runs, and if data is synced to disk before the operation, it addresses the issue.  The complete details of the Mac OS X bitcoin and litecoin wallet bounty are posted at the Bitcoin Talk forum.

42376750,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6cpOx,1385639445,ZeroBlock Bitcoin App Expands Onto Android,"Digital news, information and data aggregator ZeroBlock has arrived on the Android mobile platform. The company’s tagline promises ""An intuitive design for an intuitive currency"".  ZeroBlock's founders Dan Held and Kevin Johnson have witnessed a recent surge of interest in bitcoin, so it made sense for them to expand to Android. Held told CoinDesk:  ""With the price of BTC moving so rapidly, we wanted to get our product to market ASAP.""  Although the company has an app in the Apple iOS Store already, Android gives ZeroBlock access to many new users who may be interested in bitcoin information on-the-go. “Android is eight to nine times the iOS market,” Held added.  Many bitcoiners favour Android handsets over iPhones because of Apple's strict policy surrounding bitcoin apps. Earlier this month, Apple removed the Coinbase app from the App Store, less than one month after its launch.  Held revealed that ZeroBlock was created to fulfil the increasing demand for bitcoin data on-the-go, especially since the currency's price began rising back in April. ""We kept checking our phones, and we wanted live market data,"" he said.  Using Johnson's talents as a mobile developer on the Ripple team, an iOS app was created, followed by the web interface. The design is simple, with no additional menus.  Held said: ""We wanted something simple, clean – something [that] doesn’t need a tutorial. We used grayscale because colour evicts emotion, especially for a financial market like bitcoin.""  The app lacks colour, unless a user is prepared to pay for it. That's ZeroBlock's business model: offering a basic version, and charging extra for add-ons. Held adds that ZeroBlock is all about ""in-app revenue. You pay $2 for colour indicators and charts"".  ZeroBlock pulls its data from over 130 sources. Among other things, it scrapes Google News and company blogs, along with the Bitcointalk forum.  The company's early numbers indicate mobile information on virtual currency markets could be a fast-growing phenomenon. Held says the iOS app can often reach 50,000 opens per day. Adding Android into the mix, Held forecasts that those numbers will increase, with a whole new platform obtaining access.  ZeroBlock plans to add more charts soon, as well as advanced analytics, and a tablet version of the app is also on the horizon. Additionally, new methods of monetization are expected as Held promised that sponsored news feed posts would arrive soon.  However, ""It will have an asterisk to show it is a promoted article,"" he said.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/11/28/zeroblock-bitcoin-app-expands-onto-android,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b9e64bae7f13c9a993fae4600cffc40641c4dc4b-1063x748.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376747,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6cpJv,1385635555,SnapCard Lets You Pay in Bitcoin at eBay and Amazon,"Online startup snapCard wants to make it easier to use bitcoins online by skipping merchant integration altogether.  SnapCard users can purchase items from major retailers, even if their e-commerce platform doesn't accept bitcoin. Users can also avoid logging into a retailer's website. Michael Dunworth, snapCard's co-founder, said:  ""We want to make the shopping process as easy and fast for bitcoin users as possible.""  SnapCard  offers a bookmarklet that users can click on when they visit a product's page. The bookmarklet automatically grabs information from the product (like price and quantity) to create an item in snapCard's shopping cart.  After this, users can login to snapCard and checkout their shopping cart automatically using their linked Coinbase wallet. Users can also choose to receive an invoice from snapCard, which will allow them to pay with a wallet of their choice or fiat currency-linked debit or credit cards. SnapCard acts as a kind of payment processor, debiting the transaction amount from the user and making the purchase with the merchant.  According to Dunworth, the company's service currently works on Target, Best Buy, New Egg, Amazon and Walmart. After launching a closed beta on 8th November, snapCard is now available to the public.  The service has around 1,000 users and has completed transactions worth more than $10,000. He said the selection of goods available ranges from MacBooks to beef jerky, mainly from sites like eBay and Amazon. Occasionally, he has observed some particularly unusual purchases. He commented that, in the past, someone had once bought a ""competitive racing snail from Switzerland"".  Dunworth hopes that a positive response from snapCard users would demonstrate to merchants the importance of accepting bitcoin on their sites. He said:  ""Because of the reluctance among bigger merchants to accept bitcoins, we feel snapCard gives us an opportunity to see what users are spending their money on, and show [...] merchants that there is an opportunity among the bitcoin community.""  For shoppers, snapCard's biggest disadvantage is its 2% transaction fee. There are other drawbacks too. Not all purchasing formats are supported on snapCard. For example, users can purchase eBay items with a 'Buy It Now' price but cannot bid on auction items. Additionally, users cannot apply merchant incentives like Amazon Prime to their purchases.  By contrast, rival platform Gyft offers users a discount for paying in bitcoin. Gyft's service lets users buy gift cards from merchants like Target using bitcoin and other payment modes.  In Gyft's case, if users pay in bitcoin they are given the equivalent of 3% of what they've spent in Gyft's loyalty points. Each loyalty point is worth $0.01. Gyft users paying with PayPal only get 2%, and those paying with credit cards get half of that.  Dunworth said he is working on offering similar incentives to his users in the future. He added:  ""We would need to [offer incentives to users] - we want to stay competitive.""  Unlike Gyft, Dunworth said his service didn't ""lock in"" shoppers at the bitcoin exchange rate when a giftcard was purchased. Instead, snapCard users can trade their bitcoins for fiat currency at the current exchange rate when they make a purchase.  SnapCard has raised funding from Boost, an accelerator and investment fund that has also invested in Coinbase.  Dunworth's background lies in Australia's financial services. Previous to snapCard, he started Full Society – a service that let restaurants in Sydney offer daily discounts. He met snapCard co-founder Ioannis Giannaros last April when they boarded at the same 'hacker house' in San Francisco.  Giannaros had previously worked in online marketing and search engine optimisation. Dunworth said that he and Giannaros became involved in bitcoin at the start of the year.  Alongside another partner, Giannaros and Dunworth were the trio behind Superhero Laundry, a business that saw them clean and deliver San Francisco's dirty laundry whilst dressed as superheroes. That effort proved to be popular with the city's denizens but the service has been put on ice so the duo can focus on snapCard.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING,Joon Ian Wong,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2013/11/28/snapcard-lets-you-pay-in-bitcoin-at-ebay-and-amazon,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2d266fe238831bfa922ed344d9e3f62c289ba071-1000x682.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
