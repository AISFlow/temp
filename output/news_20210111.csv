Prosecutors have described USFIA as a Ponzi scheme and a multi-level marketing scheme.      His guilty plea on one count of tax evasion and one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud carried a mandatory minimum 10-year sentence. Judge John F. Walter additionally ordered Chen to pay the IRS $1,885,094 in back taxes.      Chen's sentencing is wrapped up but his case is far from over.

42385574,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB2MJX,1610406393,Eye-Popping Projection for $3T Crypto Market Underpins Bakkt Deal,"Cryptocurrencies could grow fivefold by 2025 into a $3 trillion market, under new projections from Bakkt Holdings, the digital-asset financial firm.      Bakkt published the estimate as part of an investor presentation released Monday in connection with its new plan to go public via a merger with Victory Park Capital, a special-purpose acquisition company. Bakkt is majority-owned by Intercontinental Exchange Inc., which also owns the New York Stock Exchange. The deal would give Bakkt an enterprise value of about $2.1 billion, according to a press release.      The underlying assumptions behind the transaction show just how bullish investors, entrepreneurs and financial executives have become over the past year on the fast-paced digital-asset industry, especially after prices for bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, quadrupled in 2020.      Just last week, the industry's total market capitalization surpassed $1 trillion for the first time, though a swoon over the past few days in prices for bitcoin and other digital assets has since trimmed the total value to about $931 billion, according to the website CoinGecko.      Bakkt currently runs a market for cryptocurrency derivatives including bitcoin futures, but in March the company plans to release a new consumer application that could allow users to manage digital assets and use them for spending and peer-to-peer payments alongside cash and rewards miles.      ""It’s these shifts that we are leveraging for the benefit of both customer and merchants, truly unlocking a massive market by empowering the monetization of digital assets,"" Gavin Michael, former head of technology for Citigroup's global consumer bank, told investors Monday on a conference call, according to a transcript.      In the investor presentation, Bakkt estimated its revenue, net of transaction-related expenses, could grow by an average 75% per year to $515 million by 2025. The company is expected to turn cash-flow positive by 2023.      According to one slide in the investor presentation, Bakkt operates in a ""massive serviceable addressable market"" that was worth about $1.6 trillion in 2020, including $564 billion for the ""notional value"" of cryptocurrency.      By 2025, the presentation estimates, the company's overall target market would increase to $5.1 trillion, including $3 trillion of cryptocurrency.

Data from CryptoCompare shows that bitcoin trading volumes on the eight major exchanges tracked on the CoinDesk 20 have passed $11 billion, a new all-time high from the previous record during 2017's crypto bull market.

""It is great to see higher volumes, making the market more liquid and efficient.""  The surging volume due to Monday's sell-off came in part from newcomers to the market, according to Schei.

""These corrections are necessary and healthy, even in a bull market.""

42385590,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB2MZt,1610400669,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Plunges to $30.3K as Options Traders Bet on Sub-$800 Ether,"Bitcoin’s plunge to as low as $30,305 was intensified from leveraged long derivative liquidations; options traders are totally bearish on ether, the native asset of Ethereum.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $33,277 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Slipping 10.9% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $30,305-$38,947 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC above the 10-hour but well below the 50-hour moving averages on the hourly chart, a sideways-to-bearish signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin’s price crumbled over the past 24 hours, going from $38,947 at 22:00 UTC (5 p.m. ET) Sunday to as low as $30,305 by 17:00 UTC (12 p.m) Monday, according to CoinDesk 20 data. In a span of 19 hours, the world’s oldest cryptocurrency fell by $8,642, a loss of over 22%. Since then the price has risen slightly but not by much, at $33,277 as of press time.      Read More: Bitcoin’s Big Drop Again Coincides With Dollar Bounce in Forex Markets      “Bitcoin is seeing a retracement of its steep move up, something that I am sure some traders welcome, having felt they missed the opportunity to add into weakness,” noted Katie Stockton, and analyst for Fairlead Strategies.      Stockton still stands by her prediction last week that bitcoin’s “support” level is somewhere below $25,000, where she expects traders to flood the market with buy orders and prop up the price. “It is difficult to discern where support will ultimately be discovered with several levels of importance starting with $25,000, but it is not likely to happen immediately given still-overbought conditions.”      The derivatives market exacerbated bitcoin’s tumble, according to Jason Lau, chief operating officer for San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange OKCoin. ""The overall market correction was perpetuated by a long squeeze on highly leveraged derivatives positions,” Lau told CoinDesk.      According to data aggregator Bybt, Sunday was by far the largest liquidation day in three months, with Binance alone processing over $500 million in long liquidations, the cryptocurrency version of a margin call.      Yet, bitcoin’s sell-off is not necessarily a bad thing for the cryptocurrency, according to some market observers.      “Today's drop should be seen as a healthy correction by smart institutions [that] bought BTC from $20,000 on the way up to $30,000,” noted David Lifchitz, chief investment officer of quant firm ExoAlpha. ”One worrying sign that we have discussed with our investors was not that bitcoin price was rising but its velocity, the speed at which it did move and the amplitude of the daily moves.”      Indeed, as bitcoin makes huge price gains and subsequent losses as happened on Monday, the volatility factor in the market is magnified. This has led to the world’s oldest cryptocurrency’s 30-day volatility metric pushed to 71.9%, a level not seen since June 5, 2020.      Despite the decline, Rupert Douglas, head of Institutional sales at crypto custody provider Koine remains steadfastly bullish. “The market doubled from its previous high in a couple of weeks,” Douglas said. “It is highly unusual for a market to behave the way it is doing (but) I think we are going much higher, over $500,000 by 2023.”      While that’s a pretty mega-bullish proclamation of bitcoin’s future price, Douglas also noted bitcoin’s notorious volatility. “There will be sharp reversals along the road so buy dips, not rallies.”    Ether option strikes orienting below $1,000    The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH), was down Monday, trading around $1,018 and slipping 19% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      Read More: Aragon One CEO Resigns in Protest of ‘Governance’ Decisions      Ether options traders appear to be hovering, like crows looking for shiny things, over the possibility of the asset dunking even further. The largest open interest strike on the ether options market Sunday was $400, followed by $480 and then $800, according to data analytics firm Skew.      Denis Vinokourov, head of research at crypto brokerage Bequant, also noted traders are likely hedging on these bets at least with some open interest in calls, which give the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy at $1,920. “The January 29 $1,920 call strike is particularly active today, when compared against other options. This suggests another round of strong dip buying for the second-largest crypto asset.”    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are all red Monday. Notable losers as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET):    bitcoin cash (BCH) - 26.5%  ethereum classic (ETC) - 25%  litecoin (LTC) - 24.9%    Equities:    Asia’s Nikkei 225 closed making big gains, up 2.4% as U.S. President-elect Joe Biden promised more government stimulus, which would help boost the global economy.  In Europe the FTSE 100 ended the day slipping 1.1% as worrying surges in coronavirus cases on the continent weighed on investor sentiment.  In the United States, the S&P 500 fell 0.70% as political tensions and potential over-exuberance in the equities market led investors to sell.

42385582,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB2MW7,1610394760,Institutions Use This Strategy to Hide Their Bitcoin Orders,"Institutional investors and speculators trading large quantities of bitcoin are taking on a new method to hide the real sizes of their trades. They are doing so – many times with the quiet help of many major exchanges – to cut the risk of exposing their intent to the market, be they bullish or bearish, which can cause unfavorable price moves.      Avi Felman, head of trading at BlockTower, took note of one such trade in the last week of December when someone, or possibly an institution, bought a substantial amount of bitcoin on U.S.-based crypto exchange Coinbase. However, the order book only showed a constant bid (buy order) for 20-40 bitcoin. Essentially a large quantity was purchased via multiple small orders.      ""Somone [sic] (@elonmusk?) has been sitting 20-40 bitcoin on the Coinbase bid and reloading since $26,800,"" Felman tweeted on Dec. 31.      This has broader implications for what happens in the market. That's because if an institution were to post a large-sized order, it would telegraph its position to the rest of the market, causing prices to move against it. Having smaller orders, in essence, fools the market into thinking there is not much interest at lower price levels when in fact there is.      A “reloading” or “refill” strategy involves breaking a large order into several small batches. For example, a trader looking to buy 1,000 bitcoin puts a bid (buy order) for 50 and waits for the exchange to execute the partial trade, say for instance 45, before refilling the order back to 50. The process is repeated until the original quantity (1,000 bitcoin) is filled.      An institution uses such a process when offloading a large quantity onto the market, as noted by Poland-based security researcher and trader Mateusz Rek (@NullZeroX on Twitter).      According to David Lifchitz, chief investment officer for Paris-based quantitative trading firm ExoAlpha, the refill strategy is similar to ""Iceberg Orders,"" which breaks a big trade into small chunks of orders similar to an actual iceberg hiding a greater mass of ice underneath the ocean surface.      When one small order is processed, the next one is sent to the market. The quantity in each disclosed batch can vary.      The above data provided by the U.K.-based APEX:E3, a cloud-based analytics platform for digital assets, shows potential iceberg orders that appeared on Coinbase in the five weeks to Jan. 7, 2021.      A series of large orders appeared simultaneously but at different price points, a typical iceberg signature. For instance, at 4:00 UTC on Dec. 11, three buy orders, each for at least 250 bitcoin, appeared at $17,500, $17,500, and $16,500, respectively. At that time, the cryptocurrency was trading near $17,800.      Execution of these stealth strategies, which help stabilize the market and help prevent significant swings, is possible only through algorithms (machine trading). As such, most exchanges offer support to institutions looking to book iceberg or refill orders.      ""Prominent exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase, FTX, Bitfinex, Bitstamp allow algorithmic trading,"" Usman Khan, co-founder, and CEO of APEX:E3, a cloud-based analytics platform for digital assets for retail and institutional investors, told CoinDesk, adding the assumption is that most algos do iceberg trades to minimize information leakage.      Read more: Bitcoin Erases Most of New Year’s Gains Amid Short-Term Profit-Taking      ""The software is monitoring order execution in real time and refilling orders until the amount defined by the trader has been bought/sold. The order size might also be randomized on each refill,"" Rek said.      However, sophisticated traders can sniff out iceberg or refill orders by looking for a series of limit trades (an order to buy or sell bitcoin at a specific price or better) continually appearing on the order book. For that reason, institutions do not rely on a single trading platform and execute the iceberg across several exchanges to avoid slippage.      ""Usually, the more the blend of fragments across exchanges spaced in time and size randomly, but in accordance with the available liquidity, the better the execution is,” ExoAlpha’s Lifchitz said, “and the less chance the large order can be prayed out by other traders who will try to take advantage of it.""",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/01/11/institutions-use-this-strategy-to-hide-their-bitcoin-orders,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a088ccac0d2d3701cd8afd9046575a2a14264c49-1920x1315.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385579,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB2MR5,1610393773,Now Is the Time to Advance the Decentralized Web,"On Jan. 6, 2021 (or what seems like the 739th day of 2020), a riotous mob stormed the United States Capitol. It has been over 200 years since the last storming of the Capitol during the War of 1812. This time, the building remained under occupation for several hours before the insurrection was suppressed. At least five people died.      This event was incited on Twitter, organized on Facebook and magnified on YouTube.    Valerian Bennett is managing director of The Pop Network Foundation, an organization dedicated to furthering the decentralizing the streaming economy as well as limited partner in Amentum Capital.    It will undoubtedly lead to calls for change in social media company policies, government regulations and maybe even court-ordered breakups. The incident is a scathing indictment of a centralized system that allows a handful of social media oligarchs to manufacture and monetize madness at scale. These companies have, effectively, replaced the free and open internet with algorithmic walled gardens built atop the economics of exploitation.      This toxic stew has been simmering for a long time. Cries for change have been sustained, loud and clear with even Sir Tim Berners-Lee, creator of the World Wide Web, sounding the alarm for the need to “decentralize the web and take back power from the forces that have profited from centralizing it.”      Surely, we can’t expect these companies to police themselves. They are making too much money with the status quo. And, despite the best intentions of government regulators, passing laws to curb these companies' predatory behavior is akin to politely asking a great white shark to stop eating in the midst of a feeding frenzy.      Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), soon-to-be chair of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, has said she’d make tackling the outsized power of tech giants one of her top priorities in the new Congress. But government action, however bold, will only get us so far. We also need to re-engineer the internet ourselves, rather than just relying on top-down help.      See also: Internet 2030 series      Just as bitcoin redistributed power from the legacy financial system in favor of peer-to-peer electronic cash, the next-generation internet aims to redistribute power from corporate giants like Google and Facebook to sovereign individuals who own and control their own data.      To achieve this monumental goal, changes must be made to the internet’s underlying architecture. Thankfully, the pace of progress is dramatically accelerating in three foundational components: storage, naming and database.    Decentralized storage    Updates across the decentralized storage community have come fast and furious. Among the many recent developments: First-gen projects Storj and MaidSafe continue building on their long-standing efforts with the respective Tardigrade and Fleming releases.      Top-tier projects like Polkadot brought us Crust, Neo has released NeoFS, and Sia gave us SkyNet with some very important complementary additions (more on that later).      See also: Juan Benet: From Idea to Action      Also, libtorrent released an update to the world’s largest peer-to-peer file-sharing protocol invented by Bram Cohen nearly 20 years ago. My own project, POP Network, has built upon the same underlying protocol and released the POP Masternode, which lets you easily provide storage for decentralized web streaming.      The flagship headline in decentralized storage last year was the launch of Filecoin. Created by Juan Benet and Protocol Labs, it is a peer-to-peer network that stores files, with built-in economic incentives to ensure files are stored reliably over time. Protocol Labs is also responsible for breakthrough decentralization technologies IPFS and libp2p.    The decentralized web will eventually become 'the' web with fairness, freedom and individual sovereignty at its core.    Since its 2017 initial coin offering, which raised $257 million, the buzz around Filecoin has bordered on feverish. Despite some early hiccups with Filecoin miners and a bug that temporarily disabled the network, the project remains the undisputed leader in the quest to bring decentralized storage solutions to mainstream users.      As a sign of the growing importance of the decentralized storage movement, CoinMarketCap debuted a new ranking list specifically for storage tokens alongside its popular lists of cryptocurrencies and decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens.    Decentralized naming    Less known but no less important for the evolution of the decentralized web is a change in how the Domain Name System (DNS) works.      DNS converts human readable domain names into Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. This lets us type “google.com” or “hello@thepopnetwork.org” instead of an unintelligible string of numbers and characters to communicate on the web. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) maintains the central repository and helps coordinate the supply of IP addresses. It also manages the Domain Name System and root servers.      Relying on single centralized authorities to make internet access decisions is an invitation for censorship and abuse. We’ve seen the dark side of this structure with authoritarian responses to freedom uprisings around the world. Within the current system, the bottom line is you can be erased from the Internet at any moment, for any reason, by anyone with enough power.      Decentralized DNS makes it virtually impossible for authorities to shut down access to the web and gives individuals real ownership over their digital identities, communication channels and means of commerce.      This area has seen massive improvements as RSK updated its RIF Name Service and “.rsk” top-level domain (TLD), Unstoppable Domains launched its own browser and “.crypto” TLD, Ethereum Name System continued to push forward with the ubiquitous “.eth” TLD, and Blockstack advanced its Blockchain Naming System with the looming Stacks 2.0 upgrade.      But, it was the launch of the Handshake public blockchain that pushed the decentralized naming sector above and beyond.      Handshake is a decentralized protocol to manage the root DNS naming zone and provide an alternative to certificate authorities. Its core software is a bitcoin fork and its blockchain is protected by proof-of-work, which means authorities don’t have a single organization to target if they want to shut down or censor communications.      Also, by decentralizing certificate authority, Handshake removes the middlemen between you and the website you are visiting. With HNS, the naming system itself can provide the guarantee that the site you are connected to is encrypted and authentic, not a fake one designed by criminals trying to con you.      Perhaps most important, Handshake is compatible with traditional DNS. If you enter a domain name and the owner hasn’t yet registered with Handshake, the software will simply redirect your request to regular DNS servers. As Steven McKie, developer for and investor in Handshake, says, “If the domain doesn’t exist on Handshake, it’s just going to fall back, redundantly, to the normal web.”      See also: Handshake Goes Live With an Uncensorable Internet Browser      Features like these are critical to mainstream adoption as it gives people the benefits of decentralization without them even knowing about it. If decentralized naming services like Handshake and others can do that, then this crucial element becomes inevitable.    Decentralized database    The most obscure component underpinning the decentralized web, which also needs the most work before becoming universal, is the decentralized database.      A database is an organized collection of data, generally stored and accessed electronically from a computer system. It is possible to think of the Bitcoin blockchain as a decentralized database storing a set of spent and unspent transactions. With that simple observation, you see the mountainous challenge facing the evolution of decentralized databases.      Bitcoin is, by computing standards, extremely slow. Databases need to be extremely fast.      Retrieving data from emails, bank accounts, video streaming and all the things we expect from the modern web is measured in milliseconds. If that data cannot be secured and controlled by the individual then we’re back to square one, turning everything over to the data oligarchs currently running the show. Without speedy decentralized databases the vision for a ""New Internet"" is fatally flawed.      Last year saw meaningful inroads with the release of Solid and PODS (personal online data stores), Bluzelle brought its decentralized data layer to Polkadot, both OrbitDB and ThreadDB continued building on IPFS and BigchainDB worked on Ocean Protocol to expand its vision of an open data economy.      With the launch of SkyNet by Sia came the introduction of SkyDB, a mutable database for the decentralized web. SkyDB is a framework that allows users to create decentralized accounts, store and retrieve files, and access their data from any device.      In short, developers can now build decentralized applications that mirror the functionality of YouTube, Twitter, Facebook and all the other modern social apps while still giving users the power and control over their own data.      The system even allows for the cross-publication of data between applications. With this open infrastructure you could have an app that has access to your Facebook social graph, native Twitter feed and YouTube watch profile, with you owning the data, not those companies.      See also: Steven McKie – Why the Decentralized Web’s Development Is Unstoppable      For context, in the third quarter of 2020, Facebook made over $21 billion selling your data.      Imagine if that revenue went directly to users who actually create the value within social networks. That’s the ultimate end for the decentralized web – to share value with the people who create it.    On to the next one    Obviously 2020 will be remembered for the immense amount of pain and suffering endured by millions around the globe. However, throughout history, moments like these are often accompanied by great periods of innovation and creativity. It is through this hopeful lens that we see a world where the decentralized web eventually becomes “the” web with fairness, freedom and individual sovereignty at its core.

42387608,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQlo71,1610389905,Bitcoin Erases Most of New Year's Gains Amid Short-Term Profit-Taking,"Bitcoin's prices have surrendered much of 2021's eye-popping gains in an equally breathtaking plunge, a drop traders and analysts said was mostly due to short-term profit-taking by some institutional investors.  Bitcoin fell to as low $30,305.30, just over $1,100 from its 2020 closing price of $29,133.86, before recovering to $32,748.52 at press time, down 14.51% in the last 24 hours.  The price for the oldest cryptocurrency is down 21.8% from its all-time high at $41,962.36, which was reached in the past week.  Darius Sit of crypto quant trading firm QCP Capital told CoinDesk the sharp price drop was likely driven by hedge funds taking short-term profits after bitcoin's price soared quickly at the start of the year.  Sit cited the bitcoin price gap between the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which mainly serves institutional investors, and other exchanges as evidence that traditional money managers could be taking some short-term profit from bitcoin's recent all-time high price.  Bitcoin futures on CME are traded between Sunday and Friday, according to CME's website. When the market closed on Friday, Jan 8., data from TradingView showed bitcoin's price on CME was at $39,520.  The CME has become the largest bitcoin futures exchange by number of open contracts because institutional interest in bitcoin continues to grow, as CoinDesk reported in December.  ""This market move appears to be investors taking positions that mean they can trade on short-term momentum changes,"" Sui Chung, chief executive of CF Benchmarks, told CoinDesk. ""The retail-driven spot market, which was pretty much the entire market three years ago, is now part of a much more mature and diverse marketplace that includes derivatives, investment funds and other institutional involvement.""  A key level to watch, according to Guy Hirsch, managing director for eToro USA, is $20,000, a level where many institutions bought bitcoin and pushed the price above $30,000 during December.  ""If we stay above $20,000, we are likely to experience the same types of rapid recoveries that we have seen in the past,"" Hirsch said. ""If we fall past $20,000, which appears to be unlikely because of the amount of institutional buying at that level, it’s anyone’s guess how far we fall. But we do feel this scenario is unlikely.""  Others said the bitcoin options market is another driver of the price volatility.  There is a great number of open options interest at the $36,000 and the $52,000 levels, respectively, according to data from Skew.  The fact that bitcoin was trading at such high levels was not normal to begin with and was, in part, a ""byproduct of [a] gamma squeeze,"" Denis Vinokourov, head of research at the London-based prime brokerage Bequant, said. ""That said, it is still possible that the market will be witness to another gamma squeeze at $52,000.""  ""Since there is a good deal of open options interest at the $52,000 price level, we could see a recovery quicker than many expect,"" Vinokourov added.  Prices for other cryptocurrencies on CoinDesk 20 also dropped sharply, following bitcoin's fall.

42385580,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB2MUr,1610387546,Blockchain Bites: Crypto Market Cap Drops Below $1T as Dollar Gains,"Bitcoin shaved off a clean 20% in trading early Monday, having failed to establish itself above $40,000. The index of all the crypto assets came down with it, with analysts calling the decline a healthy correction for an overheated market.      “Hefty spot selling against an over-levered market caused the price drop,” trader and analyst Alex Kruger told CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole. It is unclear whether it was miner selling or macro traders liquidating positions.    Top shelf    JPMorgan says... A bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) might depress bitcoin’s price in the short term, if approved, by putting pressure on Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), currently the most popular way for Wall Street firms to gain exposure to bitcoin, which comes with a heavy premium. Long term, a bitcoin ETF would be positive for the ecosystem – but first the SEC has to sign off. (Grayscale is owned by CoinDesk parent DCG.)      Block none? Dan Larimer has left Block.one, the company behind the EOS blockchain that raised $4 billion in a 2017 initial coin offering. The former chief technical officer and co-founder Larimer said he will pursue personal projects including building censorship-resistant technologies, adding specifically the EOS-attached social platform “Voice is not immune from the censorship pressure” seen in recent weeks.      Mining reset Bitcoin’s mining difficulty reset last week at a record high. According to the tea leaves, it’s now 11% harder to mine bitcoin than it was in the last difficulty cycle, a programmatic accounting of power contributed to secure the Bitcoin network. “A new difficulty all-time high is no surprise considering mining revenue has tripled in recent months,” said Edward Evenson, business development lead at Braiins, a mining software company.

(Cointelegraph)  Market intel    Inverse relationship Bitcoin slumped below $33,000 in early Monday trading, just as the U.S. dollar appeared to make gains. The Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback’s value against major currencies, is at two-week highs near 90.50 (up from a 33-month low of 89.21 set Jan. 6), according to CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole. Some see the inverse relationship between BTC and USD as a sign of bitcoin’s maturation as a macro asset.    At stake    Sell-off With prices dropping by double-digit percentages across nearly all crypto assets, the total crypto market cap shed some $156.8 billion in the past 24 hours, according to Messari data, and stands around $867 billion at press time. This comes just five days after the crypto market table crossed the $1 trillion level for the first time.      There isn’t yet a clear consensus cause for a nosedive in assets like bitcoin, ether, xrp and other large-cap cryptos. Analysts are pointing to over-levered market conditions, increased selling from bitcoin miners and growing bearish sentiment in traditional markets during a period of political instability in the last weeks of U.S. President Trump’s tenure.      There are some visible cues on the bitcoin blockchain that help piece together the story as it was unfolding. Crypto trader @lightcrypto pointed to one Coinbase sell order for 180 BTC (a multimillion-dollar sale) that preceded a $1,200 drop, CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole wrote.      Crypto is not the only market where individual sellers and buyers can have such a pronounced impact on price. The history of the stock market is punctuated by stories of short sellers, companies cornering markets and manipulating prices as well as panic selling and bad decisions.      There’s the story of two commodities traders who cornered the onion market in the 1950s. That market manipulation caused prices to crater and led to the Onion Futures Act, which bars futures speculation on onions as well as ""motion picture box office receipts.”      More recently, in March 2020, during the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, a writer in Forbes wrote about how bearish billionaire investor Bill Ackman’s emotional CNBC interview caused one of the largest sell-offs in economic history.      “Hell is coming,” Ackman reportedly said on live broadcast. “Shut it down now,” he said of the economy. “There is a tsunami coming.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average tanked over 1,000 points while he was on the air, triggering a circuit breaker. Forbes reported Ackman took out “doomsday hedges” to short sell the market in January.      During this coronavirus-induced market rout, media companies and analysts pointed to Warren Buffett’s sage advice, proffered in a 2017 shareholders letter, that downturns are inevitable. As an investor for the long term, Buffett said the best move is the easiest: buy and hold. He quotes Rudyard Kipling's ""If"":    If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs ...If you can wait and not be tired by waiting ...If you can think – and not make thoughts your aim ...If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you ...Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it.    Still, crypto’s volatility can be painful. This market drop, seemingly out of the ether (not the crypto), is the largest intraday loss since March, CoinDesk’s First Mover notes.      It’s why government bodies, like the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), are taking steps to protect retail and smaller investors. Last week, a long-simmering ban on leveraged derivatives products went into effect, while today, the watchdog issued a statement highlighting the risks of investing in crypto.      “Investing in crypto assets, or investments and lending linked to them, generally involves taking very high risks with investors’ money,” the agency said. Investors could lose “all their money.”      During the run-up, many bitcoin bulls pointed to changing conditions indicating the sustainability of a rally to a high around $42,000.

42385571,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB2MH1,1610386824,Aragon One CEO Jorge Izquierdo Resigns in Protest of ‘Governance’ Decisions,"Aragon One CEO Jorge Izquierdo has resigned, becoming the highest-profile departure from the decentralized governance project following a series of apparently controversial decisions.      “After some hectic months, I took two weeks completely offline following a doctor’s recommendation,” Izquierdo told CoinDesk in a statement. “While I was off, a series of decisions were made in the Aragon Association (mainly with respect to governance) that I disagreed both with the decisions themselves and how they were taken.”      Izquierdo added:    “There were several proposals to fix this put forward, but there was no willingness to revert or amend these decisions. As a result, no changes were made. This motivated the team to leave, and is also the reason I am resigning.”    However, Izquierdo plans on remaining a member of the Aragon community including staying on the Aragon Association’s board, he said.    Read more: ‘Decentralized Court’ Aragon Hit With Flurry of Resignations    Launched in 2016, Aragon seeks to create blockchain-based digital jurisdictions for online enterprises, particularly decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). The project raised $25 million in ether (ETH) in a May 2017 initial coin offering (ICO) and some $850,000 in two private sales with venture firms Draper Associates and Placeholder Ventures.      Until recently, Aragon One (A1) made up one half of the project. The firm was a grant recipient from the Aragon Association (AA).      That role has apparently been usurped following the acquisition of decentralized voting project Vocdoni from Dvote Labs for an undisclosed amount, a purchase announced Monday.    Read more: Aragon Acquires Voting Project Vocdoni to Flesh Out Decentralized Governance Stack    That news was preceded by the AA bringing on two new members to the team’s board, AA Executive Director Joe Charlesworth and Chief Legal Officer Jose Nuno. Both Charlesworth and Nuno were added to the board alongside Izquierdo and Aragon Network co-founder Luis Cuende.      Izquierdo said his resignation “is unrelated to the acquisition.” Rather, “with the current state of the Association, I no longer think that Aragon One can deliver on its commitments. I tried my hardest to push changes in the Association so the team wouldn't leave, but these attempts fell on deaf ears,” he said.      “The big disagreement is with regards to the Association's governance and specifically with its board,” Izquierdo added.      As for the project’s funds, the accounts are jointly controlled by a multi-sig wallet held by both Izquierdo and Cuende, Izquierdo confirmed. The AA recently converted some 52,000 ether (ETH) (roughly $50 million) into stable assets (mostly USDT) in a bid to diversify the project’s portfolio.      ""As Aragon grows, differences of opinions on how best to govern are inevitable,"" Cuende told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. ""Removing power from the co-founders has always been on the roadmap. It is not a good governance practice for power to be that concentrated. Jorge has contributed enormously to Aragon One during his time in the company. As my co-founder, I have the deepest respect for him.""",NEGATIVE,ETH | USDT,ETH | REGULATION | USDT | TOKEN SALE,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/01/11/aragon-one-ceo-jorge-izquierdo-resigns-in-protest-of-governance-decisions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fb4afd66ffb163d42a500c041684b453c3d7d387-1024x768.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385573,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB2MIH,1610378778,Tether Mints Record 2B USDT in One Week,"Tether printed two billion dollar-backed tokens last week, a new record for the leading stablecoin project.      Over 24.6 billion tethers now circulate across Ethereum, Tron and Bitcoin’s Omni Layer, per data from Coin Metrics, up from 4.8 billion one year ago.      The growth comes from a variety of factors, said Sam Trabucco, quantitative trader at Alameda Research. “Some [people] don’t put trust in their local banks or currencies,” he said, in which case using USDT is the “most liquid USD-like exposure the market has access to.”      Growth also comes when traders start to “aggressively sell BTC into USDT” or vice versa, Trabucco noted, which can cause the dollar-pegged token to temporarily trade above or below its peg.      For nearly all of January so far, USDT has traded slightly above $1 until early Monday morning when it dropped below the mark, per market data from U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange Kraken.      Per Tether and Bitfinex CTO Paolo Ardoino, new deep-pocketed institutional bitcoin investors like MicroStrategy or Ruffer Invest executing over-the-counter (OTC) buy orders has also cause significant USDT supply growth.      “Among Tether customers are all the major OTC desks and high frequency trading firms in the space,” Ardoino told CoinDesk in a direct message. Taking the buyer’s funds, OTC desks will routinely convert to USDT and spread the buying pressure across all possible liquid venues, creating demand for more stablecoins.      Trabucco also noted “heightened volumes” across all cryptocurrency trading venues over the past few weeks combined with “the ability to use USDT as collateral for an increasing number of derivatives products” as additional reasons for tether’s substantial supply growth.      Notably, trading volumes for markets quoted in USDT continue to surpass bitcoin-quoted pairs, which used to be where most trading volume concentrated.      For Tether, all of these combined market dynamics “have led to an increase in creation”, Trabucco said.      Concurrent with its meteoric supply growth, increased attention has been paid to questions about Tether’s backing, an issue that is even the subject of an inquiry by the New York State Attorney General’s office.      Per prior court statements, Tether reserves include cash, short-term reserves and other cryptocurrencies. But no bank statements or legal documents supporting this claim have been published since 2018, when Bahamas-based Deltec Bank published an unsigned letter affirming that Tether held $1.8 billion in reserves, matching the amount of USDT issued at the time.      In April 2019, Tether’s supply was only about 74% backed by fiat equivalents, per a statement from its general counsel.

42385572,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB2MKn,1610377200,Aragon Acquires Voting Project Vocdoni to Flesh Out Decentralized Governance Stack,"Aragon Association, the stewards of a protocol that makes for the easy creation of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), has announced its acquisition of voting project Vocdoni from Estonia-based Dvote Labs Oü. The purchase was completed in December for an undisclosed price.      Vocdoni team members received an undisclosed amount of ANT, the native token of the Aragon network, as part of the acquisition, according to Vocdoni CFO Joan Arús in a phone interview with CoinDesk.      Born out of the 2017 Catalan independence movement, Dvote Labs’ staff mostly consists of Catalans who experienced the suppression of a democratic vote firsthand. At the time, Catalonia tried to secede from Spain, which was deemed illegal. The vote ultimately fell flat after police suppression, riots and high-profile arrests.      Vocdoni combines decentralized infrastructure such as the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) with bleeding-edge zero-knowledge proofs (zk-SNARKs) in an effort to bring democracy into the 21st century, Arús said.      The project, while not crypto-first, uses the Tendermint consensus mechanism also employed by the Cosmos blockchain. Vocdoni is built on Ethereum, however. The protocol exists in a crowded room of other digital governance structures including Compound Finance and MakerDAO. Yet Vocdoni’s governance module is not necessarily directed toward financial ends only, Arús said.      “It’s infrastructure for digital societies,” he said.    See also: Digital Voting Is Coming. Let’s Do It Right.    Aragon Association acquired Vocdoni in order to scale its current project and to make DAOs global, the firm said.      “Vocdoni’s technology allows for infinitely scalable, free and anonymous voting with on-chain settlement. For us, that’s the Holy Grail of blockchain voting,” Joe Charlesworth, the group’s newly appointed executive director, said in a statement. “While we recently made a breakthrough to allow for off-chain voting with on-chain settlement, the privacy aspect and the usage of a sidechain and oracles to settle votes on-chain is, in my opinion, unparalleled.”      For now, Vocdoni will continue working on local votes with municipalities and private organizations, Arús said. The addition of Ethereum throughput solution ZK-Rollups is expected later this year and should make the project capable of conducting elections consisting of the entire earth’s population, Arús claimed.      “It’s super expensive – millions of dollars – to do a proper election. We thought we could do better than that,” Arús said.    See also: ‘Decentralized Court’ Aragon Association Hit With Flurry of Resignations    The acquisition comes hot on the heels of 12 resignations in the greater Aragon ecosystem, one from Aragon Association and 11 from Aragon One.      Team members vaguely accused the Association of a lack of transparency in both leadership decisions and with the project’s initial coin offering (ICO) funds. Indeed, some 52,000 ETH ($62.4 million) from the ICO fund was recently converted into largely stable assets without general disclosure to the community.

42385585,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB2MYd,1610373728,First Mover: Cryptocurrency Euphoria Hits Breaking Point as Miners Lose Nerve,"The recent euphoria in cryptocurrencies morphed into a severe sell-off, as bitcoin (BTC) prices dove 12% on Monday, which would be the most for a single calendar day since March.      Prices for the largest cryptocurrency had soared last week to an all-time high of $41,962, and that level was apparently sufficient to prompt some cryptocurrency miners to take profits. Declines were broad-based across digital-asset markets, with ether (ETH), XRP (XRP), litecoin (LTC) and cardano (ADA) suffering declines in the double-digit percentages.      ""Time to take some money off the table,"" Scott Minerd, chief investment officer of the Wall Street firm Guggenheim, tweeted early Monday. In December, Minerd predicted bitcoin prices should be worth $400,000. ""Bitcoin's parabolic rise is unsustainable in the near term.""      Yves Renno, head of trading at Wirex, told First Mover in emailed comments that he ""would expect a period of very high volatility.""      The retreat in cryptocurrencies came as investors in traditional markets also turned more cautious, amid speculation over how the final days of U.S. President Donald Trump's tumultuous four-year term might play out. Asian and European shares slid and U.S. stock futures pointed to a lower open. The U.S. dollar rose against major currencies and gold strengthened 0.1% to $1,850 an ounce.      Read More: Bitcoin’s Big Drop Again Coincides With Dollar Bounce in Forex Markets    Market moves    The long arm of U.S. regulation and law enforcement might have limited reach when it comes to global cryptocurrency markets.      That could be one takeaway from the recent trading action in the digital token XRP, which until recently was the third-biggest virtual asset after bitcoin and Ethereum's ether.      Prices for XRP plunged 67% in December after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accused the San Francisco-based payment-technology company Ripple Labs of violating federal laws when selling $1.3 billion of the tokens over a seven-year period.      Yet, some traders apparently believe the XRP tokens now represent an attractive value, reports CoinDesk's Muyao Shen. On Sunday, they changed hands at about 28 cents, up some 30% year to date.      Simons Chen, a crypto trader based in Hong Kong, told Shen he bought XRP as prices bottomed out in December, seeing a great opportunity to “buy the dip,” in Wall Street parlance.      The SEC's suit has prompted cryptocurrency exchanges including Coinbase, Bitstamp, OKCoin and Bittrex to delist or suspend trading in XRP.      But far from entering a death spiral, the XRP market has shown surprising resilience, especially when three of the world's biggest cryptocurrency exchanges – Binance, Huobi and OKEx, all with roots in China – have continued to maintain pairings with the digital asset, Shen reported. There's been significant traffic in trades between XRP and the Korean won, as well as with tether (USDT), a dollar-linked stablecoin that's popular with Chinese traders.      “Unlike Coinbase or other ‘regulated’ exchanges, Korean and [other] Asian exchanges do not need to care that much of what the SEC does, and investors in Asia are less sensitive about the news,” said Sinhae Lee, partner at Shanghai-based blockchain consulting firm Block72.      The total market capitalization of XRP tokens currently stands at about $28 billion. That's a little shy of the automaker Ford Motor Co.'s $35 billion stock market value and a little more than the U.S. bank and money manager State Street Corp.'s $27 billion.      ""No one really knows what's going to happen to it,"" Denis Vinokourov, head of research for the crypto prime broker Bequant, said last week in interview. ""It's still holding onto a decent market cap for a company that's supposed to be on its knees.""      Read More: Asia’s Retail FOMO Could Be Behind XRP’s Rally Despite SEC’s Lawsuit    Bitcoin watch    Bitcoin fell sharply early on Monday, after failing to establish a foothold above $40,000 over the weekend.      Over the past 24 hours, the cryptocurrency declined by more than $8,000 to $32,400, a drop of more than 20% from levels above $40,800 late Sunday.      “Hefty spot selling against an over-levered market caused the price drop,” trader and analyst Alex Kruger told CoinDesk, adding that it is unclear whether it was miner selling or macro traders liquidating positions.      Data provided by South Korea-based analytics firm CryptoQuant suggests miner selling did contribute to the price drop.      The 30-day average of Miners' Position Index – a gauge of how rapidly bitcoin miners are moving to liquidate inventories on cryptocurrency exchanges – rose to 2.20 on Sunday, the highest level since July 2019. A reading above 2.00 indicates miners are selling.      The index ""looks enough to make a local top,"" CryptoQuant’s CEO Ki Young Ju tweeted Sunday.

42385581,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB2MTb,1610371512,Bitcoin's Big Drop Again Coincides With Dollar Bounce in Forex Markets,"Bitcoin continues to trade in the opposite direction to the Dollar Index in a reflection of the cryptocurrency's maturation as a macro asset like gold.      The top cryptocurrency by market value slumped to $32,400 early on Monday, having set record highs above $41,800 on Friday.      The crash came alongside a bounce in the Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the greenback's value against major currencies. The DXY has jumped to two-week highs near 90.50, extending a two-day winning streak. The index reached a 33-month low of 89.21 on Jan. 6, according to TradingView.      Since the major markets crash in March, bitcoin and the index have trended in opposite directions, with bitcoin witnessing consolidation or correction during DXY's temporary recovery rallies.      ""Bitcoin's value increased as the money supply and inflation expectations grew. At the same time, the dollar depreciated to multi-year lows, resulting in an inverse correlation between the government-backed fiat and decentralized digital asset,"" Kaiko Research noted in its December market report.      Bitcoin's price fell from $12,000 to $10,000 in early September and remained sidelined for the rest of the month as the dollar index bounced from 91.75 to 94.75. Similar action was observed in June 2020.      The cryptocurrency's rally resumed in October as the foreign exchange markets began selling the dollar on expectations of additional U.S. fiscal stimulus. A steep drop in the DXY accompanied the cryptocurrency's meteoric rise from $15,000 to above $41,000 seen over the past two months or so.      The inverse correlation isn't surprising, given that publicly listed companies such as MicroStrategy are buying bitcoin to preserve the inflation-adjusted value of their treasury assets, mainly cash (USD).      ""What we're trying to do is preserve our treasury; the purchasing power of the cash is debasing rapidly,"" MicroStrategy's CEO Michael Saylor told CoinDesk in November.      The dollar's latest bounce looks to have been fueled by a rise in U.S. Treasury yields.      Bitcoin is not the only asset falling alongside the dollar's recovery rally. Gold, the classic inflation hedge, declined to a one-month low of $1,817 early Monday. The yellow metal peaked at a multi-week high of $1,959 last week as the DXY found a temporary bottom.      It remains to be seen if a continued rally for the dollar, if any, will fuel a deeper drop in bitcoin.      At press time, bitcoin is trading near $33,520, representing a 15% drop on a 24-hour basis.

Over the last 24 hours, the cryptocurrency declined by more than $8,000 to $32,400, an over-20% fall from levels over $40,800 late on Sunday (UTC). The cryptocurrency was last seen changing hands up slightly near $35,380 – still down 13.6% on a 24-hour basis.      Prices reached a record high of $41,962 on Jan. 8 and ended the last week with 15% gains, its fourth-consecutive double-digit weekly gain, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      ""Hefty spot selling against an over-levered market caused the price drop,"" trader and analyst Alex Kruger told CoinDesk, adding that it is unclear whether it was miner selling or macro traders liquidating positions.      Data provided by South Korea-based analytics firm CryptoQuant suggests miner selling did contribute to the price drop.      The 30-day average of Miner's Position Index (MPI) – the ratio of total miners' outflows in U.S. dollar terms divided by the 365-day moving average of the outflows in dollar terms – rose to 2.20 on Sunday, the highest level since July 2019. A reading above 2.00 indicates miners are selling.      ""Miner Position Index looks enough to make a local top. They're selling bitcoin,"" CryptoQuant's CEO Ki Young Ju tweeted Sunday.      Some panic selling was seen on the U.S.-based crypto exchange Coinbase. A sell order for 180 bitcoin on Coinbase quickly brought the price down by $1,200, as noted by trader @lightcrypto.      Adding fuel to the fire, a comment by Guggenheim Partners CIO Scott Minerd that bitcoin's sharp rise is ""unsustainable"" may have injected fear into the market and caused an exaggerated pullback, according to Matthew Dibb, co-founder, and COO of Stack Funds.      Most observers believe the price dip is healthy amid the overheated market.      ""The derivatives market can relax a bit, with the perptuals funding rate or cost of holding longs declining and futures premium falling,"" Patrick Heusser, head of trading at Zurich-based Crypto Broker AG, told CoinDesk, also noting heavy selling in the spot market and long liquidations worth nearly $1 billion.      Also read: Why Joe Biden’s $3T Stimulus Package Could Add Fuel to Bitcoin’s Rally      Joel Kruger, a currency strategist at LMAX Digital, said the market was severely overbought and in need of a healthy correction. Indeed, the 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart had jumped well above 70.00, implying overbought conditions last week.

Eight other investors participated in the round, including blockchain-focused venture capital firm Fenbushi Capital, cryptocurrency exchange Binance and digital asset fund manager DACM.  The seed funding will be used to develop ways of reducing friction for users interacting with blockchain applications, to bring on new staff members and launch the next iteration of the platform, Biconomy V2.  “The ways in which users pay and use blockchain applications needs a complete overhaul,” said Ahmed Al-Balaghi, co-founder and CEO at Biconomy.  “Netflix does not charge its users a fee every time they watch a video, so why should dapps charge users a gas fee for every interaction?” he added.  Biconomy aims to enable blockchain developers to provide a simplified onboarding and transaction experience for users of Web 3.0 and blockchain projects.
