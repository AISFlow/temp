42377800,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73bp7,1416163129,How Kraken is Seeking to Solve Bitcoin's Banking Dilemma,"When Fidor Bank's Michael Maier spoke to CoinDesk in June, the Internet bank COO framed his industry as one that bitcoin would grow to challenge directly, suggesting at the time that its partnership with Kraken demonstrated its intent to accept this future and even cooperate with it.  However passive these statements may have seemed at the time, they came into sharper focus on 31st October, when Fidor announced it would team with its San Francisco-based bitcoin exchange partner to launch ""the world's first cryptocurrency bank"".  The unnamed project seeks to build a regulated financial institution that would help bitcoin startups that have struggled to secure and maintain accounts even for day-to-day business.  Given this backdrop, Kraken CEO Jesse Powell sees his company's most prominent collaboration with Fidor as more than an exercise in bringing another first to the ecosystem. In a new interview, Powell positioned the specialized bank for cryptocurrencies as a necessity should the ecosystem succeed at delivering on bitcoin's full technological potential.  Powell said:  ""For Kraken to be a viable business long term, for most players to be viable, we need to see the pie grow. That’s what we want to do with Fidor, is create a bank with the specific mandate to bank bitcoin companies and provide reliable banking to end-users of bitcoin.""  By providing stable banking partnerships to companies in the ecosystem, Powell aims to, in turn, return lost time and energy to the community. In the process, he will also expand his business beyond one that targets market makers and bitcoin companies with a VC-backed order-book exchange.  However, Powell contends that Kraken has the experience it will take to rise to the challenge and deliver on its goal.  ""We’ve talked to more than 200 banks in the last year-and-a-half about banking bitcoin companies, and the successes are the ones you’ve seen so far, the 1% success rate,"" he said. ""[The bitcoin community] can’t go on wasting time. How many man hours is the industry wasting talking to banks? It’s just insanity.""  A 'bitcoinized' financial institution  Though Powell was clear on the goals the project is set out to achieve, his statements suggest that Fidor and Kraken are far from solidifying any concrete plans on the types of services they will provide. As the original release relayed, even the name of the bank – BICONDO, BYSE Bank or Cryptocurrency Bank – remains a matter of debate.  However, Powell indicated that the bank does intend to offer certain services to clients, like the ability to borrow against bitcoin assets and invest in lending products.  ""We hope to leverage blockchain technology to offer some additional services and 'bitcoinized' traditional financial services,"" Powell added.  While acknowledging that the potential that lies in advanced financial services provided by crypto 2.0 protocols, Powell said that it remains ""early days"" for such projects. Still, he doesn't rule out that they could enable Kraken to build a more robust cryptocurrency bank offering.  ""With colored coins, sidechains and Counterparty, there’s all sorts of interesting things that could merge and we could see more assets being held in this bank account that could serve as collateral,"" Powell mused.  He went on to suggest that the bank may seek to leverage the blockchain's applications for identity, implying that the institution could help other bitcoin companies validate customers even as he cautioned that any of the products the bank offers will need to meet the approval of European regulators.  Fighting back against big banks  Powell sought to frame the survival of Kraken as depending on the success of the bitcoin ecosystem itself, stressing that his company's main goal is to increase the size of the customer base it can serve in its current target markets, Europe and Japan.  He suggested that he sees the banking initiative as being in line with Kraken's existing goals.  ""You see that Google is trying to bring faster Internet connections to people, because that will increase the number of searches, and that’s their business,"" he said. ""We can give people a secure place to store and convert their bitcoin between fiat currencies and make bitcoin more functional.""  [post-quote]  Powell suggested he doesn't see the business incentive in the US market, which it stopped serving in February, given its hurdles and risks.  He further elaborated on his company's own struggles gaining access to banking in the US market, noting that it has lost key partnerships even though it is structured specifically to avoid this concern. Kraken is owned by parent company Payward Inc., which Powell described as a software company that officially licenses software to the Kraken exchange.  ""When we go to a bank and say we need an account, we can legitimately say that we’re offering software and nothing else,"" Powell said.  Despite this, he said Payward has lost accounts at both Bank of America and Chase, accounts that were kept only for handling company expenses.  ""Bank of America and Chase both terminated our account,"" he said. ""The reason they gave was that they evaluated our account, they do it once in a while, and they determined that for the protection of our users they didn't want to service our account, some bullshit like that.""  These frustrations, he suggested, caused operational difficulties that he hopes a cryptocurrency bank will help avoid once and for all.  Regulatory hurdles low, risks high  Powell went on to state that in the context of some of the more ambitious projects in the space, the regulatory hurdles for the new bank are low.  ""In Germany, bitcoin is basically money, so this wouldn't be like having a bank account with multiple currency balances, one account with dollars and another in euros, it would be an account with euros and bitcoin. It fits within the framework that exists, and we’re not pointing out any problems there,"" he explained.  When asked if there had ever been a bank created to meet industry-specific needs, Powell compared the new offering to credit unions that serve specialized employees like teachers and firefighters, but stressed that the bitcoin ecosystem requires unique solutions.  Still, Powell said that the project isn't without its risks, noting that savvy banks could begin to serve the bitcoin industry, creating an ecosystem of new competitors.  Competition from banks aside, he said, should a sizeable portion of the ecosystem seek to utilize the institution, it would be easier for regulators to harm the industry as a whole.  Though optimistic about its potential, Powell suggested he sees the cryptocurrency bank as a necessary experiment, though one capable of falling short on its aims.  ""It’s still not a foolproof plan,"" he concluded.

42377786,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73bYl,1416158458,"""I Love the Blockchain, Just Not Bitcoin""","In an age of microblogging and relentless conferencing, zeitgeist is not written in novels but in phrases shorter than 140 characters.  One cannot leave a FinTech or digital currency conference without hearing some rendition of ""I love the blockchain, just not bitcoin"". However, as with most clichés, the phrase actually addresses the core of the issue: it begs for a defense of blockchains and the bitcoin blockchain as the best in-class.  Blockchains are data structures that have two distinct features:  They have native tokens that form the basis of all recorded information and economic incentives for using the system. The tokens are native as they are governed by the protocol that governs the data structure and have no external dependencies like central banks or financial institutions.  They contain a chain of cryptographic proofs that ensures the data has not been tampered with, lest the chain of proofs would not be able to be reconstructed. The chain of proofs has the neat property that it reveals the amount of work it took to construct the chain. This enables the network to converge on one chain as the true chain, the one with the most work done, and discard all but one.  The title of this article addresses a key challenge that has been the cause for much debate in the industry: do we need to have only one native token with a fixed supply in our data structure, or could we have none – or many?  To miss the value of these native tokens would be to also miss the value of the data structures that store them. I would like to push for blockchains with native tokens rather than just blockchains (innovative, probabilistically immutable databases) which have far lower utility, if any at all.  Security and integrity  Without going into the technical details of how blockchains are secured, it's important to understand the native token as the incentive mechanism for the security and integrity of the blockchain (for those that want a technical overview of the security model see the dynamic-membership multi-party signatures explained in the recent sidechains whitepaper).  At the base level, the blockchain technology is a data structure that contains within it a chain of proofs that must hold true. This structure allows us to verify that the history of transactions or information that is being presented has not been altered or tampered with, ensuring data integrity.  The reliability of the proofs is directly dependent on the economic incentives provided to the people or organizations that supply the proofs.  In bitcoin, a miner that earns the right to publish a block on the main chain is currently paid 25 BTC (roughly $9,500 at publication time). This provides adequate incentives to have highly specialized hardware running in data centers around the world.  If the reward halved, as it is set to do in 2016, the incentive to provide these proofs would halve and we could likely see a scenario where the proofs would then be far less reliable (partly due to the excess hardware that could be bought on the cheap). In other words, without a high token value on a blockchain, there is little security or integrity of the data contained within.  Universal financial coverage  There are relatively few bitcoin business models out there that are truly harnessing the ability to provide universal financial coverage, due to a number of factors like supply chain limitations, regulatory barriers and bitcoin’s volatility. Isn’t then the obvious solution to do away with bitcoin and keep the blockchain?  Without a native token, though, and with only a decentralized and open ledger we cannot achieve universal financial coverage. Financial institutions that adopt, co-opt, or fork the blockchain technology will produce no better financial coverage than they do at present.  To see why this is the case, we can look at the following examples of applications that have been built on the basis of financial coverage (note this is not an endorsement of any of these services, rather an examination of their use of universal financial coverage).  Tipping (ChangeTip, Dogetipbot etc.)  Silk Road 1.0, 2.0, etc.  Gambling sites (SatoshiDice, Updown etc.)  The Dogetipbot and more recently Changetip have created a frenzy on Reddit. A simple web scraper enables people around the globe to transmit value by typing a few words into a website.  The tips themselves are all recorded in centralized databases so the “low cost” of cryptocurrencies is irrelevant. The important factor is that the coverage is truly universal and that any user can, when they choose, withdraw the bitcoin or dogecoin from the service and use it in their everyday life.  In the future, this could become the basis of integrating virtual realities with physical processes.  Drug marketplaces needing to avoid criminal clampdowns and deliver truly global marketplaces require universal financial coverage (as well as relative anonymity). The extent of the coverage enables these platforms to gain critical mass to win the trust of their user base. Cross-country supply chain integration is possible because of the extent of financial inclusion.  Gambling sites are some of the only places in the cryptocurrency ecosystem that do not give dollar or fiat equivalent currency units. Sites like SatoshiDice and Updown give the bettors information on the extent of the house edge.  The volumes going through these sites are incredibly impressive considering that the operators often conceal their identity and are potentially operating illegally in certain parts of the world.  The demand for transactions is somewhat insulated from bitcoin volatility since the house edge can be as large as 70% on a binary option. Their user growth and reputation was again only achievable due to the universal financial coverage (bitcoin) and ability to independently audit their processes (blockchain).  One of the most popular bitcoin casinos, Just-Dice, conducts their bets off-chain. Wagers are not recorded in the bitcoin blockchain and are only stored on the Just-Dice servers.  With over 1 billion bets made on the platform, it's clear that the key advantage is universal financial coverage. While there is not the ability to independently audit their processes via a blockchain, bitcoin casinos like Just-Dice provide provably fair gambling.  There is no reason that traditional gambling services could not do this as well, but we seem content to rely on their real-world reputation and the certification of their services by some gambling authority.  Model for innovation  The underlying blockchain technology relies on universal financial coverage and distributed computing to achieve its value as one of the first databases with provable integrity.  Centralized services may operate on top of the bitcoin protocol but will always face high competition due to the relatively low barriers to entry (open source software) and low switching costs (installing apps on a smart phone).  We are still early in our understanding of blockchain technology. The excitement around the integrity of the ledger, its openness and its potential to unlock global financial inclusion must be embraced in a holistic framework. The blockchain’s security and utility depend on its native token. Currently the most secure and reliable blockchain is clearly our dear friend bitcoin, but this does not have to be the case forever.

42377801,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73bnr,1416148880,HyprKey Introduces Fingerprint Scanning to Secure Bitcoin Transactions,"If there’s one thing standing in the way of mainstream bitcoin adoption, it’s cyberfraud.  So says the team at HyprKey, the startup aiming to protect digital currency users from fraud by utilizing the HYPR-3 three-factor authentication protocol.  HyprKey  works by creating a biometric authentication bridge between the user and the mobile wallet built on top of it. It auto-converts bitcoin in real-time so users can spend it without ever even touching the digital currency by linking their debit cards, thereby authenticating transactions at the point of sale.  “The reason that [cyberfraud] struck me as the main problem is bitcoin is inherently an irreversible system of payment,” chief executive George Avetisov said in an interview with CoinDesk, explaining:  “The problem with fraud is we can’t use reversible digital payment systems like debit cards and credit cards and the current banking system that we have, which is reversible, to transact with irreversible digital currency.”  While people in the bitcoin community are racing to create or discover the killer app that will make bitcoin more mainstream, HyprKey holds that it won’t be an app, but rather, a protocol.  “We’re missing a device,” Avetisov said. “That device is off-device authentication.”  Security pitch to VCs  On Tuesday, HyprKey, which just closed $350,000 in private investment, competed for a $10,000 seed investment alongside 35 other startups in a series of speed-pitching rounds at the Empire Startups Summit at New York City's Webster Hall.  At the summit, the team presented an example of using of a debit card to purchase a $500 item from Dell, which recently offered a 10% discount to customers making purchases with bitcoin. The item would cost $500 to the customer paying with a debit card and checking out the traditional way, but would cost $450 to that same customer using the same debit card through the HYPR-3 platform.  “The important thing for us was to hear from an otherwise skeptical outsider that if they were able to save money during a purchase by using our platform, they would,"" said Avetisov. ""That was everything we needed to hear.”  A side effect of cyberfraud  The HYPR-3 token is a sticker, roughly the size of a price tag or a large sticky bandage, that gets placed on the back of the user’s phone, or phone case, and communicates with it via Bluetooth. When the user swipes his or her finger on the device, it reads the fingerprint, registers the static discharge from that finger motion and authorizes the transaction.  The reader introduces a third step in security, after users’ PIN codes and the sticker itself.  “Three-factor authentication basically renders your wallet unhackable,” Avetisov said. “You would need to have me physically authenticate this transaction for it to go through.”  HyprKey's CTO Bojan Simic explained that having the biometric TOTP (time-based one-time password algorithm) token generator is what eliminates fraud from the equation, allowing the conversion to bitcoin in real time.  “By eliminating fraud we can basically eliminate interchange fees as well and determine that the person making the purchase is 100% that person,” he said.  An intermediary gateway  The base problem of authentication schemes, Avetisov said, is that some consumers won’t feel safe using it while others simply don't want to be bothered adding another step to their payment process.  For merchants, a major appeal of digital currencies is in the irreversibility of transactions. Consumers, on the other hand, are heavily focused on usability and can be dissuaded by the complexities involved with using bitcoin. This remains a sticking point for potential everyday users, and according to Avetisov, the addition of an extra level of security measures can worsen the situation.  He continued:  “If we could solve the issue of authentication then we could let them use it in real time without ever actually knowing what it is, or touching it, or understanding it, or being exposed to its volatility or risks or security problems.”  HyprKey went through a number of alpha stages before landing on the biometric sticker. For now, according to the team, this is the simplest deployment method because using the sticker separates the authentication process from the user's operating system.  “We’ve done it in a way that doesn't make you feel like you’re wearing or having to walk around with another thing,” Avetisov said. “All the contents of our wallet are going to be in the phone, in the tablet, soon enough. This is an archaic thing, the wallet. It’s going to be completely digital in the next couple years.”  Looking ahead  The company plans to manufacture 25,000 units and have them ready this coming May, when it runs its beta.  HyprKey intends to keep consumer transaction fees in the range of 0.02% to 0.03%. Aside from its high-level risk model working to ensure seamless auto-conversions, another way HyprKey is able to keep fees so low is by bundling them – a strategy it believes has been preventing micro-transactions.  The company holds that it’s the merchant platforms in the bitcoin space that need it – not only to help take bitcoin into the mainstream, but because merchants in any payments system stand to lose the most from cyberfraud.  Implementing the HYPR-3 protocol doesn’t require any sort of merchant-side integration, Avetisov explained.  “Mr Bob in Bosnia could have a HyprKey and Alice here doesn’t even need to know what HyprKey is,"" he said. ""If she accepts bitcoin, that gateway is complete. HyprKey has no merchant-side integration nor does it require any. We feel that the consumer is being ignored in this whole bitcoin revolution for some reason.”  He added: “It’s the platforms and the merchants that are suffering – never the banks, never the card companies. They never lose.”  This article included additional reporting from Stan Higgins.
