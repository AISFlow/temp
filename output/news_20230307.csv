42411200,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glLsdW,1678233137,Silvergate's Collapse May Spell Regulatory Trouble for Crypto,"Silvergate Bank had a really rough week, to the point where a not-insignificant number of people were waiting for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to announce the bank had entered receivership after close of business Friday.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  The fall of SEN  The narrative  Silvergate Bank announced last week it had to delay filing its annual 10-K form because of questions it received from its independent auditors. In the same form, under the “forward looking statements” section, Silvergate announced it was facing bank regulator inquiries, a U.S. Department of Justice investigation, congressional scrutiny and concerns about its ability to be a “going concern” over the next year. Generally speaking, these are all bad signs.  Why it matters  Silvergate is (was?) the bank in crypto. It counted some of the industry’s biggest firms (in the U.S.) as its clients. The fact it’s now in a position where it may soon fold is not a good signal for the rest of the industry, and gives regulators a prime example of what happens if the banking sector gets too close to crypto.  Breaking it down  Silvergate had a really bad week. Its stock is down 61% over the past week, with the bulk of that fall coming last Thursday, dropping its stock (SI) to $5.41. It’s actually down 94% over the past year, and obviously a bit lower than its all-time high of $212.  It’s not inconceivable the bank will have to enter receivership in the near future. It may still recover – the bank may have more capital than we realize, or it may receive a rescue package from an investor – but a lot of its most prominent crypto clients have already left, and the bank shut down its most attractive product, the Silvergate Exchange Network, last Friday.  Silvergate appears to have sold off billions of dollars worth of bonds at a market loss to keep up with withdrawals, which in turn meant it no longer met certain regulatory requirements that indicated it was perfectly fine.  Bloomberg’s Matt Levine explains it much more clearly in a newsletter from last week. Elizabeth Lopatto over at The Verge explains both what happened and some of the impacts to businesses.  The main result is that crypto firms are going to have to look for other banks. Some companies will find this easier than others. The established titans of this industry will, I imagine, not have too many difficulties. If you're a company with a history of operating without major issues, you'll probably be able to convince a bank that what happened to Silvergate wasn't your fault (and in a sense, it wasn't).  If you're starting an enterprise, it may be more difficult. Startups in this industry have traditionally had difficulty gaining banking services, and that won't be made easier by federal bank regulators warning financial institutions under their charge that they need to be careful, or maybe need permission, when dealing with crypto.  On Monday, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the Biden administration was monitoring the situation, and that U.S. President Joe Biden would continue to call on Congress to do something. This isn't likely to reassure banks either, to the extent they may want to wait for Congress to act.  Banking services like deposits aside, companies may also have issues with accessing payment services, at least in the short term. Circle, for example, has already cut off its ACH support, at least temporarily.  A spokesperson pointed to Silvergate. “Amid growing concerns about Silvergate Bank, Circle has accelerated plans to deprecate some services and transition others to additional banking partners, completing a process that began last year to reduce risk to our customers, our business and USDC. We are communicating with customers and have taken steps to ensure access to customer funds via alternative payment and redemption channels,” the spokesperson said in a statement.  All of this will become a backdrop to the regulatory response. Bank regulators have already gone out of their way to warn about crypto. But beyond that we've already heard from officials such as Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael Hsu, who warned months ago there may be “contagion risk.” Just this week Hsu gave another speech, where he said last year’s FTX collapse reminded him of a major bank failure, Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI).  To date, despite the fall of FTX and the dozen or so bankruptcy filings last year, there hasn’t been a huge risk of contagion from crypto to the traditional financial sector. That may finally be changing.  To be clear, Silvergate didn’t fail merely because it banked crypto. But if crypto companies rushing to withdraw their funds – creating a bank run – led to Silvergate needing to sell off its bonds, which in turn led to it being under-capitalized, which has now led to the bank coming close to receivership, then this was another victim of last year’s massive failures and evidence of that contagion risk.  Regulators are likely to continue warning that crypto is fraught with danger, and have a perfectly primed example to point to.  It remains to be seen if Silvergate really does fail or if it finds a path to survival. It also remains to be seen just who will pick up its former clients – Signature Bank, the next-friendliest bank to crypto, or another of the myriad institutions out there or even a crypto-native company that has successfully run the gauntlet of the Federal Reserve Board application process.

Grayscale’s day in court  Grayscale Investments will finally have its chance to argue the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has no choice but to allow it to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) product into an exchange-traded fund (ETF).  To recap: In June the SEC rejected Grayscale’s bid to convert GBTC to an ETF, citing common refrains about a lack of a robust surveillance-sharing agreement with a national securities exchange, the potential for market manipulation and TKTK. Hours later, Grayscale appealed the decision, filing suit in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C.  Disclosure: Grayscale is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, the parent company to CoinDesk.  Grayscale received support in the form of five different amicus (friend of the court) briefs, signed by The Blockchain Association, Chamber of Digital Commerce, Coin Center and the Chamber of Progress; Coinbase; the Chamber of Commerce; NYSE Arca; and a group of individuals.  Grayscale’s main argument seems pretty straightforward: It’s arguing the SEC’s decision to disapprove its GBTC conversion – or indeed, any spot bitcoin exchange-traded product – despite its past approvals of bitcoin futures ETFs is “arbitrary to its core.”  “Its central premise – that the Exchange’s surveillance-sharing agreement with the CME provides adequate protection against fraud and manipulation in the bitcoin futures market but not the spot bitcoin market – is illogical. Any fraud or manipulation in the spot market would necessarily affect the price of bitcoin futures, thereby affecting the net asset value of an [exchange-traded product] holding either spot bitcoin or bitcoin futures as well as the price investors pay for such an ETP’s shares. Either CME surveillance can detect spot-market fraud that affects both futures and spot ETPs, or that surveillance cannot do so for either type of ETP,” the company said in its summary.  The company also argued the SEC was inconsistent about how it approached futures markets.  Read more: GBTC Discount Narrows to 42% Ahead of Grayscale’s ETF Hearing Tuesday  For its part, the SEC argued that futures-based ETFs and spot ETFs “are fundamentally different products,” with different surveillance-sharing agreements and oversight mechanisms.  In a brief, the SEC tried to draw a clear distinction between bitcoin futures and spot bitcoin markets, saying the futures products it regulates hold underlying assets that either trade only on CME – namely, cash-settled bitcoin futures – or cash and cash equivalents. Grayscale’s proposed ETF would be based on actual bitcoin, which could trade on any crypto exchange, including those overseas.  Similarly, for futures products, CME has surveillance-sharing agreements with NYSE Arca and Nasdaq, the SEC said, once again noting that CME is where the actual bitcoin futures contracts trade.  “Because of CME’s comprehensive surveillance measures and the one-to-one relationship between the regulated market (the CME) and the underlying assets (CME-tradable bitcoin futures), the Commission concluded that CME’s surveillance ‘can reasonably be relied upon’ to capture the effect of attempts ‘to manipulate the proposed futures ETP by manipulating the price of CME bitcoin futures contracts, whether that attempt is made by directly trading on the CME bitcoin futures market or indirectly by trading outside of the CME bitcoin futures market,’” the SEC’s filing said.  The judges seemed largely skeptical of the SEC's arguments.

A decision could come around May 2023. You are exposed to Bitcoin price risks regardless that could change the return profile. In the upside case, you could see an almost 60% return, though there is downside risk too. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) may win a court case to enable it to convert to an ETF later this year. That would enable it to potentially close its discount to NAV creating a +59% return for investors. Currently the market appear to imply that the chances of legal victory is quite low (about 1 in 4 on my estimates), but assessment of today's hearing suggest otherwise. You are of course exposed to Bitcoin (BTC-USD) volatility in the interim, which could cause the trade to lose money even on conversion, and GBTC's high fees will erode value too. Also, even if the case is won by GBTC maybe they chose not to create an ETF or maybe some other ruling or action blocks spot Bitcoin. Still, if you're constructive on Bitcoin this is an interesting setup. Legal Arguments In today's legal arguments in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, basically GBTC argue that the SEC is using inconsistent ""arbitrary and capricious decision making"" in blocking a spot Bitcoin ETF when many Bitcoin futures exist, for example see ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO). That's a Bitcoin ETF that trades today based on Bitcoin futures pricing. Media coverage of the arguments has been positive to GBTC. Greyscale Bitcoin Trust's Discount To NAV Some brief history. Greyscale Bitcoin Trust was one of the first ways to easily trade Bitcoin. Now it's a comparatively high fee structure to own the cryptocurrency as investors have other options. That's led to a discount to NAV. That is to say that the value of the trust is less than the value of the Bitcoin that it holds. To some extent that makes sense, if Bitcoin were flat over time, you'd receive 90% of your cash back after 5 years due to the 2% annual fee. However, the discount to NAV is currently extreme. Below you can see the price of GBTC and its NAV. The discount has closed somewhat on today's news but the discount is still large. Also note that at times prior to 2021 GBTC traded at a premium to NAV. Data by YCharts Scenarios Let's assume that Bitcoin does not change in price and the NAV remains at $20.33/share. At the time of writing, the price is $12.78/share. Here are some scenarios: Premium/Discount to NAV GBTC Price ($) Simple Return +10% 22.36 75% 0% 20.33 59% -10% 18.27 43% -20% 16.26 27% -30% 14.23 11% -40% 12.20 -5% -50% 10.17 -20% Source: Author's calculations To be clear, I don't think GBTC will return to a premium to NAV, but ETFs typically trade in a very tight spread around NAV, so that would imply a 59% return from current levels if GBTC became an ETF. Of course, if GBTC remains in its current high-fee trust format, the discount could widen again and maybe you lose 20% or more from current levels. GBTC's Incentives You might think that GBTC wants to keep their high cost structure and keep charging 2% fees. However, the discount to NAV is today so large that they could well be more profitable trading at NAV with a lower fee. Also the history of the ETF market has shown first-mover advantage, so if GBTC can become the first ETF to market at scale, then they may continue to enjoy a large asset basis over time. What The Current Price Might Imply Scenario Approx. value GTBC becomes an ETF $20.33 GTBC remains a trust with a 2% fee forever (50% NAV discount) $10.17 Source: Author's calculations With the share price at $12.80 we can infer (simplistically) that the market believes there's a 26% chance the court case is successful and GBTC converts to an ETF. Of course, this is pretty basic analysis and carries limitations. Risks Of course, there are risks here, specifically: The U.S. system is becoming increasingly anti-Bitcoin, maybe the currency is banned or ownership is heavily regulated or taxed in some other way. In that case the discount to NAV may not matter if the price of Bitcoin fell materially or became harder and more costly to own. Just because GBTC might win the court case doesn't mean they are obligated to create a Bitcoin ETF, maybe they will win and choose not to. Bitcoin is volatile. If the price of Bitcoin fell ~38% from here, the discount to NAV would close in a much less favorable way for investors. So you could lose money even with a favorable legal outcome. The timing of the legal decision is hard to estimate. Looking at similar cases in the D.C. court a May 2023 decision is possible, but equally legal cases can drag on for much longer. You'd be left paying 2% fees while you wait and as mentioned above Bitcoin is volatile. Maybe GBTC will win the legal case, but the SEC will find another way to block a Bitcoin ETF using some other process or language, or another law or regulatory agency blocks it. For example, the SEC could decide to block Bitcoin futures ETFs and achieve regulatory consistency here. I'm not a lawyer so I may be misunderstanding the legal nuances here. Conclusion The market may be underpricing the chance of GBTC winning the case. This is not a certain outcome, and if the SEC continues to want to block spot Bitcoin ETFs, they may find another route. However, given Bitcoin futures do trade in an ETF structure today, it appears GBTC has a case and this issue could be resolved within months for an attractive return.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4585409-legal-ruling-could-collapse-gbtc-discount-to-nav-within-months?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/10397146.jpeg

42411185,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glLrpv,1678232240,Why Yuga Labs' Embrace of Bitcoin NFTs Is a Big Deal,"It could not be a more interesting time in Bitcoin.  Yuga Labs, the $4 billion company behind the Bored Ape Yacht Club non-fungible token (NFT) series, generated $16.5 million from its first NFT auction using the Ordinals protocol on Bitcoin. These 288 NFTs, part of a collection called TwelveFold, created shockwaves through the crypto community on Tuesday.  The company announced its plans to launch the project last week, a move that should not be understated. Yuga Labs is a juggernaut in the NFT space – it developed three of the current top 10 most valuable NFT collections and owns the intellectual property for more – and so far has not created any NFTs on any other blockchains other than Ethereum, where the majority of digital collectibles currently exist – meaning that one of the largest companies in crypto is betting big on Bitcoin.  Aubrey Strobel is the host of The Aubservation podcast and former head of communications at Lolli.  Interestingly enough, development on Bitcoin has been trending up during this crypto down turn. This week, there's been talk about deploying ZK [zero-knowledge] rollups on Bitcoin, the Ordinals project has kept its momentum and a buzzy decentralized social media protocol called Nostr, which uses Bitcoin Lightning payments, is gaining users.  Where did this all begin? For many years, people regarded the world’s number one digital currency as a pet rock. This is not a dig against Bitcoin, it’s a result of its careful design and stewardship. Bitcoin is meant to be sound money – and it does a fanstastic job of that. But at the same time people and companies have been asking, could Bitcoin be bigger?  Though NFTs began on Bitcoin via Counterparty, they were not popular during the last bull market because Bitcoin is not smart-contract friendly. Building on the network takes a bit more work than building on networks designed to run decentralized applications. The Ordinals project took advantage of a Bitcoin upgrade from 2021, called Taproot, and allows for digital artifacts to be inscribed on the actual blockchain.  So-called bitcoin NFTs are notably different and potentially better than NFTs on Ethereum, which often require data to be stored on external servers such as IPFS. An Ethereum NFT is an immutable token, which links back to potentially mutable data. Ordinals makes storing NFTs more secure, because settlement stays on Bitcoin’s chain forever. It's possible many other popular NFT series could follow Yuga's footsteps and deploy projects on Bitcoin.  Read more: The Art of Scarcity | Opinion  In fact, Ordinals creator Casey Rodamor created a ""burn address"" that makes it possible to destroy a NFT series on Ethereum while inscribing and redeploying it on Bitcoin. It remains to be seen whether people and capital will ditch networks like Ethereum and Solana for Bitcoin entirely, but it's impossible to deny that this is a new day for Bitcoin. Instead of simply being held, more and more bitcoins will be put to use.  Yuga's embrace of Ordinals is just a catalyst for embers that were already burning. Last year, for instance, Trust Machines, a startup looking to build the bitcoin ecosystem, raised $150 million last year to build bitcoin products. Counterparty, Liquid, Stacks, RSK, Lightning and others have been around for years building sound infrastructure on which people could use their sound money.  Of course, many of those projects have been met with varying amounts of skepticism – a trend encapsulated by the love it/hate it response to Ordinals. In one camp, many believe that Bitcoin should not be a testbed for development or a home for frivolous projects. In the other, that Ordinals, Nostr and other projects are the next onramp for Bitcoin adoption.  See also: The Rise and Fall of Bitcoin Culture | Opinion  Now, the online Bitcoin community is at a metaphorical fork in the road, because Ordinals is not going away any time soon. People want to build on Bitcoin, and because it is open source they can. This brings us to perhaps the most important element here, the on-chain evidence. One statistic you cannot deny is that the Ordinals project tipped the number of non-zero Bitcoin addresses to a new all-time high of 44 million, according to Glassnode.  Time will tell on the future of Bitcoin. Yuga's embrace of Bitcoin should be a signal that the future is bright, and there's still much to be explored in this exciting and dynamic industry.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | SOL,Aubrey Strobel,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/03/07/why-yuga-labs-embrace-of-bitcoin-nfts-is-a-big-deal,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6433cd8cb3cb5c2b74c8e033644854b38df40abb-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The FDIC did not immediately return a request for comment.  Silvergate shares were rising 2.5% to $5.34 in after-hours trading on Tuesday.  Silvergate announced last week it would delay the filing of its annual report because it needed to answer requests from its independent auditors and accounting firm, in addition to pending regulatory and other inquiries and investigations. The company further warned that its ability to “continue as a going concern” over the next year might be impacted by its issues.  The majority of its crypto clients subsequently announced they had left or were leaving the company, sending Silvergate's share price falling by more than 50% to an all-time low.

42412724,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl5vIs,1678227559,"Signature Bank, Stablecoins Might Benefit From Silvergate Exchange Network's Demise","It wasn’t really crypto, and it wasn’t really a network. But the program at Silvergate Bank called the “Silvergate Exchange Network,” or SEN for short, played a crucial behind-the-scenes role in facilitating off-blockchain money transfers between big investors and crypto exchanges.  Now, the network has been shut down – closed last week as the bank’s parent company, Silvergate Capital Corp., acknowledged there were questions about its ability to continue as a “going concern,” and that it would be late in filing an annual report with securities regulators. Even before the announcement, key users of SEN, including the crypto firms Coinbase, Gemini, Paxos, Circle, Galaxy Digital, Cboe Digital and Bitstamp, were already dropping off, citing the need for caution.  Kraken, a crypto exchange, tweeted Tuesday that ""we are winding down our relationship with Silvergate,"" taking steps to ensure that ""client and operating cash is safe and secure.""  With no clear prospects for a restart of SEN anytime soon, analysts and industry pros are trying to estimate how valuable the network really was as a core part of the nascent crypto-markets infrastructure, and if other blockchain firms or even traditional banks might step in to fill the void.  “It's hard to know just how damaging the loss of SEN would be right now,"" said Noelle Acheson, former head of research at CoinDesk and Genesis Trading. “I suspect it was probably a low fraction of what it used to be, so the immediate impact is not that significant. It's more a regrettable removal of a convenient service.”  Silvergate launched SEN in 2018 and had seen significant adoption of the platform, with transaction volume reaching $100 billion in the fall of 2020. Pretty much all major U.S.-based crypto exchanges became clients of Silvergate and started moving money through the network.  The SEN wasn’t really an interbank network per se like SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) or Fedwire, two well-known funds-transfer services that banks use. Rather, it was a collection of accounts at Silvergate, long seen as a crypto-friendly bank, that were able to instantly transfer money between one another.  So if an institutional investor had an account at Silvergate, sending dollars to an exchange was as simple as making an internal transfer to that exchange’s account at Silvergate. The functionality was available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year.  Naturally, the SEN business served as a marketing tool to lure crypto firms to park deposits at Silvergate.  “It was a significant convenience for crypto customers, in that it dragged traditional banking into crypto hours,” Acheson said. “Rather than wait for weekday banking hours, customers could transfer fiat 24/7/365, much like the way crypto markets work.”  Fast growth before swift decline  At the market’s peak, in the fourth quarter of 2021, SEN had grown to process over $219 billion in transfers, generating $9.3 million in revenue.  It goes without saying that the amounts diminished over the course of this year to fourth-quarter levels of $117 billion and $6.6 million, respectively, as digital-asset prices tumbled and the industry descended into crypto winter.  While it is still unclear what is going to happen to Silvergate Capital (SI), there are multiple alternatives for the now-shut network, according to analysts and experts.  Signature Bank, another crypto-friendly bank based in New York, offers a program called Signet, launched in 2019 and using blockchain technology to allow for real-time settlements. It is the only other banking alternative to SEN that allows for instant U.S. dollar transfers to exchanges – as of now.  Crypto banking firm BCB Group CEO Oliver von Landsberg-Sadie said in an interview with CoinDesk Monday that his company’s payments processor is accelerating plans to add U.S. dollar capabilities to help fill the hole left by SEN. (Currently, it deals in euros and the British pound, but not in dollars.)  “I’d like to say it could be live by spring, so we’ll do whatever it takes to make sure those who are stranded by SEN get some sort of continuity given the huge overlap of BCB and Silvergate clients,” Landsberg-Sadie said.  Stablecoins  Other traders will likely go back to using stablecoins like Circle’s USDC or Tether’s USDT to make quick trades; the dollar-pegged tokens are usually easy to move around the so-called digital rails.  A Kaiko report on Monday said that “stablecoins will likely become even more ubiquitous among traders,” with the “death” of SEN.  With Silvergate on the brink, the institution might get acquired by another bank, possibly with assistance from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). If that were to happen, the acquiring bank might choose to restart SEN, or just let it lie.  “Unless they're a bank that is already operating in a crypto market, the probability is that they would not want to set up a crypto business based upon what Silvergate had,” said Dick Bove, chief financial strategist at Odeon Capital Group.  For crypto traders, the technology seemed to have been a game changer and a convenient bridge between traditional finance and the crypto ecosystem, enough so for the industry to find ways to keep it alive despite the shutdown of SEN.  “I don't know how unique the technology is,” said Dave Weisberger, CEO of CoinRoutes. “What I can say categorically is that the functionality it offered will continue to be provided and by multiple sources.”  “There are plenty of other people ready to jump into the breach,” he said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/03/07/signature-bank-stablecoins-might-benefit-from-silvergate-exchange-networks-demise,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fce5eb29a05614e9832e86436cf5e37abf14df74-1920x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42412735,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl5vQM,1678227010,"Bitcoin Rebounds Above $22K, Equities Struggle After Fed Chair Powell Says Rates Are ‘Likely to Be Higher’","Bitcoin dropped below $22,000 after U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in prepared remarks in his two-day semiannual monetary policy testimony before Congress that inflation had remained unexpectedly high. But the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization quickly recovered to trade above the threshold for much of Tuesday.  BTC was recently trading at about $22,060, down about 1.6% from Monday, same time. Bitcoin has been largely holding over $22,000, even as a flurry of jobs and price indicators have raised inflationary concerns anew.  “The latest economic data have come in stronger than expected, which suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated,” Powell said Tuesday before the Senate Banking Committee. “If the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes.”  Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, slid 1% in the past 24 hours to trade around $1,550. The CoinDesk Market Index, which measures overall crypto market performance, was down 1.3% for the day.  Most other major cryptos were largely in the red, aligning with equities markets, which also wrestled with Powell’s remarks. The S&P 500, Wall Street's benchmark equity index, closed down 1.5% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped by 1.7% and 1.2%, respectively. The prospect of a 50 basis point (bps) interest rate hike instead of a more dovish 25 bps now rests at over 70%, roughly the reverse of the probability last week, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.  Rates are currently “the missing piece of the puzzle,” David Brickell, director of institutional sales at crypto liquidity network Paradigm, wrote in a weekly newsletter. “Should they continue to reverse lower, conditions look ripe for a push higher, which would be painful for a market that remains under-positioned risk.”  The correlation between crypto and stocks, however, has been declining since late 2022, with the 90-day correlation coefficient of bitcoin and the S&P 500 currently reaching 0.38 – the lowest level since June 2022, Coin Metrics’ data showed. A coefficient of 1 means the movements are perfectly synchronized, whereas negative 1 indicates they are moving in opposite directions.  Samir Kerbage, chief investment officer at the crypto asset manager Hashdex, told CoinDesk in an interview that “a big movement” in crypto prices could still occur if the Fed’s interest rates hike turns out “much different” than the consensus expectation. The 50-basis point hike for March is “still painful” for markets, he added.  Edward Moya, senior market analyst at foreign exchange market maker Oanda, wrote in a Tuesday note that while BTC was able to hold onto the lower boundaries of its key trading range following Powell’s testimony, risk appetite across the board is “very vulnerable.”  “If this wave of risk aversion does not pass, cryptos may struggle to make fresh 2023 lows,” he wrote.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/03/07/bitcoin-edges-above-22k-again-equities-struggle-after-fed-chair-powell-says-rates-are-likely-to-be-higher,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/af4082b67533d9cb37ee4e3a1dcd23136e7de3e4-1439x809.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42412722,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl5vHw,1678226785,"Binance.US Can Move Ahead With Plan to Acquire Voyager Digital's Assets, Judge Rules","Binance.US cleared a major hurdle in its effort to acquire the assets of bankrupt crypto lender Voyager Digital in a deal worth over $1 billion after Michael Wiles, a bankruptcy judge in the Southern District of New York, overruled the various objections to the proposed acquisition.  While the judge said he would still work through the confirmation order, he indicated he was in favor of approving the deal. Binance.US may still have to clear certain regulatory hurdles before the deal can be finalized. Voyager's VGX token surged over 8% in the minutes after the ruling.  The plan, assembled after previous bidder FTX itself filed for bankruptcy protection in November, had been supported by 97% of Voyager creditors who responded to the proposal, which could see them recovering nearly three-quarters of their holdings.  The lengthy hearing started with good news for creditors, with Voyager lawyers saying creditors could potentially make a 73% recovery – with a bullish crypto market raising a previous estimate of 51%.  However, regulators from Texas and New Jersey have warned those benefits could be significantly damped if FTX’s Alameda Research succeeds in clawing back $445 million in loan repayments made before its own bankruptcy filing in November.  During day four of the hearing on Tuesday, Judge Wiles ultimately ruled that these regulators' objections did not outweigh the need to proceed with the restructuring of Voyager.  The court heard from a range of witnesses on complex topics such as whether personal data would be handed over to Binance.US under the deal, and why the transfer represented a better deal for creditors than immediate liquidation.  Creditors quizzed Voyager’s financial advisers over points such as how to treat more exotic kinds of crypto assets and how to deal with customers in states such as New York, Texas, Vermont and Hawaii, where regulators don’t let Binance.US operate.  Other obstacles to the deal, mainly placed by wary regulators, appear to have fallen away. Early on in the hearing, Judge Wiles took a dim view of objections from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Earlier court filings suggested Voyager struck a deal with the Federal Trade Commission to avoid interfering with a deceptive marketing probe.  The hearing, which began Thursday, also gave various parties and regulators a chance to object to the proposed sale. The judge ultimately ruled that many of these objections either did not make a strong argument or that they would have unnecessarily bogged down proceedings.  ""If the government wants to litigate that"" Voyager's sale of VGX tokens was an offering of securities, it should have done so, he said, referring to an SEC attorney's statement that the proposed sale may have securities law tie-ups. However, the regulators did not choose to do so; based on the evidence provided during the hearing, Wiles would have had ""no choice"" but to rule that the transactions were perfectly legal, he added.  Other concerns raised by parties included the possibility that Voyager customer data, including Social Security numbers, would be shared with Binance.US and may be stored in offshore databases. An attorney representing Binance.US said no Binance.US employees would have access to this type of information.  Jamie Crawley contributed reporting.

Miami-based Yuga Labs, however, is now facing pushback after users criticized the company’s tailored bidding process. Some argued that because Yuga Labs held bidders’ bitcoin, it is now setting a bad precedent for future projects.  Solano, however, said Yuga’s decision to use the Bitcoin blockchain is the company’s effort to be more transparent. By being explicit, the company could then “set the best precedent … given the constraints of running a trustless auction on Bitcoin that simply isn’t possible at this stage.”  Via the Ordinals protocol, the Bitcoin-enabled NFT collection required that its bidders have a self-custody wallet in which they would need to place the full amount of their bids directly to Yuga.  As part of the auction, bidders also needed to have an empty wallet that would receive the NFT. More than 3,200 bidders placed their bitcoin upfront. Unsuccessful bidders would “have their bid amount returned” to their wallet addresses within 24 hours, the company said in a tweet.  “It was important to Yuga that we weren’t going to be using something that was going to be obfuscating that trust, but actually putting it front and center,” he said regarding the company’s use of the Bitcoin blockchain.  The auction, which Solano said is still in an “incredibly nascent” space, creates a way for Yuga to drum up developer interest, while adding to the security budget of the Bitcoin chain and experimenting on it, he said.  “We're marketplace agnostic, except for the fact that we strongly believe in creative royalties and want to see marketplaces stand by creators,” Solano said.

42393843,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brQxSv,1678222113,Fed Chair Powell's Comments Shift Rate Projections; Bitcoin Holds Warily,"Thoughts of bitcoin (BTC) recapturing its 20-day moving average this week diminished Tuesday as a troubling inflationary picture took center stage once again.  Less than three hours after U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell highlighted inflation’s intransigence in testimony before the U.S. Senate Banking Committee, bitcoin’s price remained above $22,000, well off its highs of the past month, with little chance of the price going higheramid the type of increasing monetary hawkishness that has historically discouraged investors.  At 9 a.m. ET, markets were assigning a 70% chance to the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) boosting interest rates by 25 basis points (bps) during its March 22 meeting.  But by 10:30 a.m. ET, as Powell testified, the probability of a 25 bps increase fell to 46%, and by 12 p.m. ET the probability fell to 37%.  Last month, with macroeconomic data heading in a more favorable direction, markets saw a 98% chance for a 25 bps increase.  To be sure, BTC and ether (ETH) prices have been resilient even as jobs and price data has soured. In the initial hour after Powell’s comments, bitcoin and ether fell 0.30% and 0.44%, respectively, before quickly regaining lost ground.  Still, instead of bitcoin’s price recapturing its 20-day moving average, the overriding question now is whether it can even hold its 50-day moving average. Moving averages offer longer-range pictures that can help investors evaluate the strength of bull and bear markets.  BTC and ETH prices are now within 2% and 1%, respectively, of the lower end of their Bollinger Bands. A breach of the lower band would imply an outsized decline from its prior mean, and is viewed as a bearish signal. Prices for BTC and ETH were near the upper range of their Bollinger bands less than two weeks ago.  During his testimony, Powell emphasized that while inflation has moderated, it remains “well above” the long-term goal of 2% and still has a “long way to go.” Most striking about Powell’s testimony was commentary that recent economic data was “stronger than anticipated.”  The unexpectedly challenging inflation data implies the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's rate-setting group, is behind rather than ahead of schedule in its rate decisions and will likely be more aggressive about upcoming rate decisions. The ceiling for rate expectations, which is ranging between 5.125% and 5.625% on the current “dot plot,” is likely to shift higher; in turn, sending the prices of cryptos and other risk assets lower.  In the aftermath of Tuesday’s developments, investors may want to watch long futures contract liquidations for both BTC and ETH. While the volume of liquidations is currently low, crypto price declines will likely create a domino effect as traders are forced out of long positions.",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/03/07/fed-chair-powells-comments-shift-rate-projections-bitcoin-holds-warily,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/48ee9afef8bcdd7c1b3939b686482ba8954418a1-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411954,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glhjuN,1678220822,The Evolution of DeFi and the Emergence of DeFi Derivatives,"The content of CoinDesk Indices; not affiliated with CoinDesk editorial.  By Reza Akhlaghi, Senior Content Marketing Manager, CoinDesk Indices  Progress in a jolted market  Much of the news coverage of the crypto industry, to no one’s surprise, has revolved around one overarching theme: business practices and subsequent business failures that have evoked an image of a house of cards. Some of these failures were of epic proportions, such as those of FTX and Three Arrows Capital. In fact, dampening of and outright loss in investor confidence were hallmarks of the blockchain economy in 2022. But another look at the above failures reveals that none were caused by the underlying blockchain infrastructure.  In the same year, 2022, progress in underlying blockchain technology and infrastructure continued apace. Ethereum underwent a successful upgrade and transitioned from a proof-of-work (POW) blockchain to one of proof-of-stake (POS), which came to be known as the “merge.” The tokenomics of Ethereum continued to evolve as smart contract platforms saw growing use cases and viable business adoption in NFT and DeFi, positively impacting the Ethereum ecosystem.  In this post, we look at institutional adoption of DeFi, the role and emergence of derivatives in it, and digital assets in the CoinDesk Market Index that are DeFi derivatives.  Institutional adoption of DeFi  Decentralized Finance (DeFi) refers to digital assets that support financial products and services that are not facilitated or controlled by any central entity. These financial products and services are accessible without any barrier to entry or identification requirements. All DeFi tokens must be created on smart contract platforms and offer open-sourced liquidity with the ability for token holders to reserve governance rights. Growth and investment in DeFi have been one of the key developments in digital asset market and crypto ecosystem with increasing interest from institutional investors.  To be or not to be in crypto—that is the question for institutional investors today. Over the past two years, the emergence of Web3 and its related technologies, such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and the growth in the development of smart contract protocols that power the DeFi infrastructure, have drawn attention and interest from institutional investors to crypto as an emerging asset class with promising investment opportunities. Despite current economic challenges, as of early March of this year, the current total value locked (TVL) in DeFi protocols, which is a method that measures the value of all assets locked in them, stood at $49.82 billion, according to DeFiLlama. Another barometer of growth in DeFi is trading activity on decentralized exchanges, or DEXs. Trading activity on DEXs has grown significantly over the last two years as DEXs have established themselves in the industry as gateways to DeFi.  In the banking sector, a growing and diverse number of players are opening and launching crypto and digital asset desks and divisions. In 2022, banking institutions of all stripes went on a hiring spree, seeking high-calibre talent with expertise and experience in the crypto space.  In November of last year, JP Morgan, a bellwether of investment banking, in a joint project with the Monetary Authority of Singapore, executed its first cross-border transaction using DeFi on a public blockchain. As another stamp of approval for DeFi, in October last year, BNY Mellon, the world’s largest custodian bank, announced the formation of an enterprise digital assets unit to develop solutions for digital asset technology that bridges digital and traditional asset custody. And within retail banking, according to CB Insights, from August 2021 to May 2022 alone, over 20 banks made at least one investment in blockchain and crypto-related entities. Another development that was widely seen as a major vote of confidence in DeFi, this time coming from regulatory circles, was the approval of Anchorage Digital, a crypto custodian, to become the first federally chartered cryptocurrency bank. Many of these institutions now offer a whole slew of DeFi products, including crypto index funds that give investors a varying degree of exposure to crypto.  In essence, what the market has witnessed over the past two years is a gradual about-face by institutional investors on digital assets; that is, a shift from looking at crypto with skepticism to embracing it as an investment opportunity. As institutional investment in this asset class takes hold, different institutions will develop their own requirements for risk management along with their custody requirements. Seen from a socio-economic perspective, DeFi could be on its way to making access to financial services more egalitarian by migrating the trust layer from intermediaries to sophisticated software codes on the blockchain.  Defi Derivatives  DeFi derivatives, similar to their counterparts in TradFi, are securitized contracts that give their owners exposure to an asset’s value and the ability to hedge price risk without owning the asset. But in the DeFi world, derivatives are smart contracts hosted on the blockchain. Derivative products include futures, options, swaps, forward contracts, prediction markets, and collateralized loans.  Some DeFi derivatives products offer investors the opportunity to develop synthetic assets whose values are tied to underlying real-world assets. DeFi derivatives are practically smart contracts that eliminate the role of a broker. In other words, in DeFi, the terms of derivatives are fulfilled on-chain by smart contracts.  With their ability to tokenize securities, DeFi derivatives are poised to transform not just the derivatives market, but also the overall securities market. According to BlackRock, the next generation of securities markets will be tokenization of assets through distributed ledgers.  DeFi derivatives inside the CoinDesk Market Index  The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) is a broad-based index consisting of over 150 constituents¹ that is designed to function as a benchmark for the performance of the digital asset market. The CMI measures the market capitalization-weighted performance of the digital asset market, subject to minimum trading and exchange eligibility requirements.  At present, there are four DeFi derivatives assets in CMI. The four digital assets are as follows:  BarnBridge (BOND)  Ren (REN)  Synthetix (SNX)  UMA (UMA)  For more information about the CMI, and our broad market benchmarks and investible sectors, including CoinDesk DeFi Index (DCF) and CoinDesk DeFi Select Index (DFX), contact us at sales@coindesk-indices.com .  ¹As of February 3, 2023  Disclosure  CoinDesk Indices, Inc.

Nevertheless, the arc of growth and global understanding of this new technology is barely getting started.  Noelle Acheson is the former head of research at CoinDesk and Genesis Trading. This article is excerpted from her Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, which focuses on the overlap between the shifting crypto and macro landscapes. These opinions are hers, and nothing she writes should be taken as investment advice.  Critics accuse the crypto ecosystem of failing to come up with a clear utility (in spite of global evidence to the contrary). They accuse us of hiding behind the “we’re still early” excuse. These are generally people steeped in traditional market ethics who expect clear and tangible results after just a few years of evolution, and they believe the perceived fact that these results haven’t materialized means they never will. I even recently heard someone insist that the internet didn’t take so long to get off the ground.  Well, not quite: ARPANET, the precursor to today’s vast network, sent its first message in 1969 – html and the first globally accessible websites didn’t appear until 22 years later. Seven years after that, a renowned economist was still insisting that the internet was unlikely to be relevant. We are only 14 years into the development path that was triggered with the processing of the first bitcoin transaction in 2009. Just imagine where the industry will be in 2031, 22 years after blockchain’s equivalent “first message,” and what kind of dismissals it will still be getting seven years after that. We are still early.  For further proof of this, we need look no further than a casual scan of crypto headlines on any day we care to choose. There will invariably be several talking about the evolution of existing blockchains, new blockchain designs, use case controversy and so on.  Read more: Noelle Acheson - The Future of Crypto Markets Will Be Driven by Developments in the East  Even the longest-running blockchain, Bitcoin, is still evolving. The community is currently caught up in a debate over whether it should be used for non-fungible tokens. On one side, we have those who believe in the power of evolution, experimentation and the lack of gatekeepers. On the other, we have those who worry about “silly pictures” clogging the network and detracting from its payments use case.  On the periphery are those who insist bitcoin (BTC) will never be used for payments. In emerging as well as not-so-emerging markets are many who already do. In sum, even Bitcoin’s utility is still being debated, just as its technological potential is being probed and expanded.  Other large networks such as Ethereum are in even greater stages of flux: upgrades to alter its functionality, radical changes to something as fundamental as address management, rapid layer 2 growth, fierce experimentation with security and privacy technologies, new applications, revised versions of existing ones and ambitious “Ethereum killer” competitors still emerging.  How can we not be early when we are still debating technology standards, let alone applications? Historian and economist Carlota Perez talks about cycles of technological adoption: First comes the installation phase in which the infrastructure is built, then comes the deployment phase when the technology is broadly adopted. Obviously, we are far from broad adoption – we don’t even agree yet on what that means. Not only are we still in the early phase of installation, we’re also trying to establish a new technological base with fragmented initiatives pursuing emerging use cases on a global, fragmented stage.  Read more: Noelle Acheson - An Overlooked Source of BTC Support: Its Price Floor  What’s more, we’re doing so with strong regulatory resistance. This is frustrating but understandable: Blockchain technology is not trying to improve widgets or help us move faster. One of its main aims is to transform how we transact, and thus the technology is perceived as a threat by today’s gatekeepers. Arguably, finance should change slowly because there’s so much at risk. But resistance to change also poses a material danger to societal cohesion.  People with at least a passing acquaintance with history know that our civilization moves in cycles, each driven by a radically new technological innovation. It remains to be seen whether blockchain technology will usher in a new cycle or continue to build on that initiated with the rollout of the internet – I personally believe the former but, either way, only 14 years in, we’re early.  Critics are right in calling us out for sometimes hiding behind the “early” excuse to explain bad behavior and lax code vetting. Just because we’re a young ecosystem doesn’t mean we can’t do better.  In turn, however, we can call out those who stand on the outside looking in while criticizing us for not doing more, for not trying harder and for not succeeding despite the audacity of the change we want to see, and the colossal obstacles that have been in our way from the beginning. We can call out vested interests, those that put the static before the dynamic, and those more interested in the convenient than the meaningful.  Back in 2014, venture capitalist Marc Andreessen compared the state of Bitcoin then to that of the internet in 1994. I disagree with his diagnosis: When he made his comments Bitcoin was more like the internet in the 1980s, still figuring out what it wanted to be and how it could become useful.  But here’s the thing: Most of us couldn’t have invested in early internet businesses. That generational opportunity was limited to venture capitalists and their accredited investors. With the blockchain ecosystem, however, investment in early opportunities is open to anyone with an internet connection, anywhere in the world. And often, the investment is not – as in the 1990s – in a shell or wrapper that represents the technology. Now, the investment can be in the technology itself.  When will we no longer be early? When mainstream coverage is as much about adoption and new applications as it is about asset price moves. When the technology ceases to intimidate the crypto curious. When regulators see new financial applications as opportunities rather than threats.  That day may seem very far away at the moment. But it’s not – whether it’s five, 10 or 20 years from now, the crypto ecosystem is unlikely to give up or even slow down. Anyone who has ever built anything lasting knows that persistence, at scale, wins. And that change may seem a long time coming, right up until the moment it starts happening fast.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Noelle Acheson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/03/07/yes-crypto-is-still-early,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b3a238fdc62f558def6dc4e2c5db9d10a9ca9bca-5923x3332.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The discount narrowed to 35% following the hearing where a panel of appeals court judges appeared skeptical about the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) arguments in rejecting Grayscale’s bid to convert its GBTC into an exchange-traded fund (ETF).  The judges questioned the SEC's logic in distinguishing between bitcoin spot market prices and futures market prices.. Grayscale’s argument is the SEC acted arbitrarily in rejecting the ETF application and previously approving bitcoin futures ETFs.  The GBTC discount began to narrow last week ahead of the hearing, after widening to almost 50% in early December.  Crypto-focused hedge fund North Arrow Digital, tweeted that it remains long on GBTC following the court case. “The discounts represent very strong [risk/reward] investments given multiple potential avenues to value realization.

42411186,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glLrtE,1678219141,A Dozen Reasons Why the SEC Should Have Approved Grayscale's Spot Bitcoin ETF,"In a recent episode of “What Bitcoin Did” with host Peter McCormack, Grayscale’s longtime chief executive, Michael Sonnenshein, said his company’s decision to sue the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was not taken lightly. In the sometimes contentious interview, Sonnenshein noted Grayscale has been in open communication with the top securities regulator, speaking often and on a regular basis.  “To actually take the decision to sue the regulator that oversees our business was a pretty heavy decision to have to make,” Sonnenshein said. He added the stakes are “almost existential” for the future of Grayscale, and could have a significant bearing on “bitcoin itself.” (Grayscale and CoinDesk are both owned by Digital Currency Group.)  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Grayscale decided to sue in June 2022, on the same day its application to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a “spot” exchange-traded fund (ETF) was denied. The trust today is the world’s largest bitcoin investment vehicle, holding an estimated 3% of bitcoin’s total supply and earning Grayscale millions of dollars in management fees per year. “You don't need to be a GBTC holder past, present or future to care about this lawsuit,” Sonnenshein said.  It’s hard to say whether the stakes here are as pivotal as claimed. There are certainly a lot of companies looking to enter the bitcoin ETF market. The SEC has denied about a dozen bitcoin ETF proposals so far, including from Fidelity, SkyBridge Capital and Valkyrie Investments. And the estimated 1 million investors in Grayscale’s trusts could certainly benefit from a conversion – GBTC trades today at a massive discount to its underlying bitcoin holdings, in part because the “closed-end” trust model makes it easy to deposit but not withdraw bitcoin, limiting the chance for arbitrage.  See also: Fidelity Prodded SEC to Approve Bitcoin ETF in Private Meeting  (In fact, to give a sense of the demand, FTX’s “adult in the room” John J. Ray III decided to sue Grayscale on behalf of bankrupt hedge fund Alameda Research, one of the largest holders of GBTC and Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust, in a bid to pressure Grayscale to open withdrawals and reduce its fees. Grayscale has called the lawsuit “misguided.”)  So why doesn’t the SEC just approve these investment products? The SEC’s consistent explanation – like the one given in a 70-plus-page briefing in December – has been that the spot bitcoin ETF proposals have not met its standards aimed at preventing fraud and protecting investors.  To say that's been an unsatisfying answer is to undersell it (more than GBTC is being undersold). In fact, many onlookers go as far as saying that the SEC is being “arbitrary and capricious,” a phrase that comes up time and again when it comes to the watchdog’s oversight of crypto. At least it’s a phrase that came up repeatedly in the hundreds of letters interested and unconnected parties wrote to the SEC asking it to approve the bitcoin ETF product.  Approving a bitcoin ETF would be a proactive step towards providing consumers with a regulated way to gain exposure to bitcoin. While crypto is in the political doldrums today, there is still demand for these products – seen clear as day by reading some of the letters to the SEC. It’s true the SEC has a mandate to protect investors, but preventing products from coming to market – when similar products are easy to access abroad – is just limiting the agency’s ability to regulate effectively.  The core argument in favor of approving a spot bitcoin ETF, at least at this time, is that the SEC’s concerns about manipulation are literally inconsistent – and possibly in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, as Ribbit Capital’s Sigal Mandelker and Jessi Brooks wrote. The agency has already approved exchange-traded products that use bitcoin futures contracts, particularly NYSE Arca’s proposal to list and trade shares of the Teucrium Bitcoin Futures Fund and Nasdaq’s proposal to list and trade shares of the Valkyrie XBTO Bitcoin Futures Fund. Both of the funds provide “surveillance-sharing agreements” designed to prevent manipulation, which the SEC says every spot BTC application has lacked.  Putting aside the additional costs and risks related to managing and “rolling over” bitcoin futures contracts, it’s not clear this additional surveillance actually protects investors against the types of risks the SEC is concerned about. As Grayscale lawyers have noted in the past, “the reference rate for the CME Bitcoin futures market and the pricing indices that BTC and other spot bitcoin products use to value their shares are based on the same data: trading prices reported on the same bitcoin trading platforms.” In other words, any potential fraud in bitcoin markets would hit spot- and futures-based products equally.  There’s an additional argument to make that the SEC has often regulated crypto after the fact – going after firms after crimes were committed and, as the saying goes “regulating through enforcement.” A bitcoin ETF would be a more proactive way for the SEC to expand its oversight while avoiding “picking winners and losers,” University of Arkansas law professor Carol Goforth wrote. So far, by rejecting every spot bitcoin ETF application on his tablem SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has been cutting off his nose to spite his face.  See also: Judges Express Skepticism of SEC Arguments in Grayscale Bitcoin ETF Suit  It’s possible the SEC will expand on its reasoning today, when it and Grayscale have the chance to present their opening arguments in the lawsuit. Analysts at Bloomberg Intelligence are giving Grayscale a 40% chance of winning the suit, which Sonnenshein said the company would consider appealing all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court if it loses.  In the podcast interview, Sonnenshein said he “can’t imagine” why the SEC “wouldn’t want” to benefit investors by converting the vehicle. Far from protecting consumers, the only explanation for Gary Gensler’s “arbitrary and capricious” acts is to save face.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/03/07/a-dozen-reasons-why-the-sec-should-have-approved-grayscales-spot-bitcoin-etf,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/203ae0960c1c58db25f13b6865f6096bd34fed10-1374x773.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42410834,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggru1Y,1678217104,A Closer Look at FTX’s Most Recent Bankruptcy Documents,"The longer John J. Ray III leads FTX through bankruptcy, the more fantastic the story of FTX’s collapse becomes.  On March 2, FTX published a press release detailing a presentation filed for the exchange’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy case, citing a “massive shortfall” in assets.  How massive? CoinDesk reported on the shortfall last week (worth $2.2 billion and counting), but some additional context is useful in highlighting just how massive and shocking the shortfall became.  The deficit at FTX and its MAPS problem  The filing broke up assets into two categories: Category A and Category B. Category A assets are tokens with a market capitalization of at least $15 million and an average daily trading volume of at least $1 million. Category B assets are tokens that don’t meet that criteria or are largely held or controlled by the estate (i.e. FTX).  Category A assets include cryptocurrencies and assets like bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and cash.  A cursory look at just those two assets for FTX (which does not include FTX US) reveals something really beyond comprehension. The identified deficit between customer payables, which are customer balances, and total assets, which are assets the bankruptcy team has located plus the amount of customer balances owed to FTX, was $1.6 billion in bitcoin and $870 million in ether. Add on the shortfall in cash and stablecoins of $6.4 billion and you’re left with an utterly outstanding deficit.  And that deficit isn’t bad simply because of its absolute amount, but also because of the relative amount it represents in the context of all holdings, especially when looking at bitcoin. See, FTX owes customers $1.6 billion in bitcoin, and it has only $6 million of it on hand.  Six million dollars is not a typo. Million.  That’s a more than 250 times difference.  What exactly was FTX selling its customers when customers bought bitcoin on its platform?  If you look at Category B assets, it gets even stranger. Here, FTX boasts a surplus between what it owes customers and what it has on hand.  Most of that surplus is made up of a $1 billion MAPS holding. That sounds great until you realize that MAPS’s current market capitalization of circulating tokens is between $2 and $3 million, according to CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. So FTX is missing about $1 billion of the $1 billion it claims to have. It’s missing because most of that $1 billion is attributed to the project’s fully diluted value, which represents the value of a project if all the tokens outstanding enter circulation, a figure that sits at about $450 million.  The implication here is that FTX holds almost the entirety of that token’s value and presumably it will sell its MAPS to make up the documented shortfall across other assets. Of course, who knows what the value of the tokens will be when it starts to sell almost all of them?  FTX US is better, but still …  Looking at FTX US is equally mind numbing.  There is far less of a shortfall at FTX US, and some of it might even be excusable, like a $2 million gap on $66 million of owed bitcoin. Maybe the $31 million shortfall on $38 million of owed ETH is bad, but whatever.  The strangest part of the FTX US schedule has to do with Solana (SOL). The bankruptcy team has located exactly zero of the $19 million the company owes customers.  (Note: the “-” in the above graphic is the accounting notation for actually zero, not something that is less than a million since the schedule is presented in millions rather than in actuals.)  How does FTX US have no Solana for customers? Zero. That feels incredibly, uhm, irresponsible.  The last bit worth sharing from the filing is a pretty jarring disclosure that I will simply present without comment. As it shared this information, the company said that it isn’t possible to predict customer recoveries because (among other reasons):  The presentation does not attempt to adjust for commingling of assets or insider access to assets, which may be the subject of future, material adjustments.

42412731,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl5vPQ,1678214259,"Federal Reserve’s Powell: We Don’t Want to Strangle Crypto Innovation, but Sector Is a Mess","If the crypto industry was looking for a silver lining in Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s testimony at a hearing before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday, the best he could offer was that he’s hoping there’s something useful and innovative amid crypto’s mayhem.  ""We have to be open to the idea that – somewhere in there – there is technology that can be featured in productive innovation that makes people's lives better,"" Powell told members of the committee in his twice-yearly trip to testify on Capitol Hill.  “We don’t want to stifle innovation,” he said.  Powell was asked to address cryptocurrency issues several times during his testimony, which will continue Wednesday before the House Financial Services Committee.  ""We've seen just a remarkable set of events in the crypto space,” he said, noting there’s been “quite a lot of turmoil” in the past year, with companies collapsing and high-profile fraud being revealed. “We see in crypto activity lots of things that suggest that regulated financial institutions should be quite cautious in doing things in the crypto space.""  The Fed and other U.S. banking regulators have repeatedly issued statements and policy interpretations that all amount to a heavy warning to banks that the agencies are watching their crypto moves closely. In the most recent warnings, regulators specified that banks that focus their businesses in this sector probably won’t meet safety-and-soundness standards, which are a baseline for being able to continue to operate in the U.S.  Silvergate Bank has been offering a real-time example of the dangers of crypto concentration in banking, as most of its crypto customers have withdrawn their deposits from the floundering institution.  Issues with stablecoins  Powell, who suggested that Congress needs to step in to provide a “workable legal framework” for digital assets in the U.S., also directly addressed stablecoins as an area in need of oversight.  “People are going to assume when they deal with something that looks like a money market fund that that has the same regulation as a money market fund or a bank deposit,” he said. “So stablecoins need some attention in that respect.”  Powell said there’s a place for stablecoins in the financial sector if they get “appropriate regulation,” but Powell argued that “there are real concerns about permissionless public blockchains, and the reason is that they've been so susceptible to fraud, to money laundering and all of those things.”  Still, it was Powell’s broader views on the economy that had the most immediate effect on the crypto sector. After his comments Tuesday that inflationary pressures are running higher than expected, bitcoin (BTC), which is viewed as a riskier asset that suffers when interest rates rise, fell about 1.6% to below $22,000. The price, however, has bounced back a bit since then, trading recently at $22,319.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/03/07/federal-reserves-powell-we-dont-want-to-strangle-crypto-innovation-but-sector-is-a-mess,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f8eb7794d5c977dc7752d1a529c1b7ec04d1aca4-5898x3318.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42412716,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl5vCK,1678209319,Stablecoin Issuer MakerDAO Proposes Additional $750M U.S. Treasury Purchase,"MakerDAO, the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) behind the DAI stablecoin, is reviewing a proposal that would allocate an additional $750 million to invest in U.S. Treasurys as it looks to take advantage of a favorable yield environment. If passed, the resolution would add to the $500 million approved in October, bringing the ceiling to $1.25 billion.  The new proposal would have the DAO investing in six-month U.S. Treasurys using a ladder strategy with a biweekly rollover, meaning the purchased notes will have maturities that are equally split over the full period. The strategy would be flexible and Maker could move to a more complex or different ladder scheme, if needed.  DAOs are groups organized around a shared purpose or idea. These groups don’t have central leadership, but instead have community votes to make decisions and use software to carry out those decisions. Maker’s first U.S. Treasurys investment was intended to help further stabilize its DAI stablecoin, which was already overcollateralized at the time. However, stablecoins in general took a reputational hit when Terra’s UST stablecoin collapsed early last year.  “After review of various highly liquid money market options, we found that the simple solution of laddering U.S. Treasurys over a six-month period with biweekly maturities presents a strong, flexible and effective solution for Maker,” wrote Allan Pederson, CEO of decentralized finance (DeFi) asset manager Monetails, in a post. He noted the advantages to the strategy include the low cost, tax efficiency and inherent liquidity as the Treasurys mature on the ladder.  Pederson said Maker expects to see partner BlockTower proposing a similar allocation structure soon, but notes that Monetails requested the allocation happen immediately to take advantage of the current yield environment. However, Monetails doesn’t act as asset manager or investment adviser or have any influence on the purchase of the Treasurys. The asset strategy will instead be handled by Sygnum Bank.

(COIN) is being sued by a customer who says the crypto exchange refused to help him after he lost $96,000 from his Coinbase wallet due to a hack, according to a filing in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California San Francisco Division on Monday.  The plaintiff, Jared Ferguson, lost “90% of his life savings” after his phone was hacked, the court filing said. Ferguson lost service on May 9 and T-Mobile technical support told him to get a new SIM card. After restoring service to his iPhone, Ferguson noticed that all the money had been taken from his Coinbase wallet.  The plaintiff immediately contacted Coinbase, which asked him for information about the security of his device, the last authorized transaction and a list of unauthorized transactions. Just over two weeks later, he was told Coinbase could not help him.  “Customers … are responsible for any activity that occurs when those devices or passwords are compromised,” Coinbase told Ferguson in an email, according to the court filing. It added, “Please note you are solely responsible for the security of your email, your passwords, your 2FA codes and your devices.”  Now, Ferguson has brought claims against Coinbase alleging the crypto exchange violated state laws by not crediting his account in full for his losses.  Ferguson alleges that Coinbase violated the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, which was enacted to protect customers engaging in electronic fund transfers, as well as article 4A of the California Uniform Commercial Code, which states that if a bank authorizes an unauthorized order, then it should refund the customer with interest, even though Coinbase is not a bank.  Coinbase ""takes extensive security measures to ensure our customer accounts remain safe,"" the exchange said in an email to CoinDesk. It ""encourages customers to take measures to secure their personal accounts and information outside of Coinbase. We educate our customers on how to avoid cryptocurrency scams and report known scams to appropriate law enforcement authorities.""

42412733,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl5vSE,1678206230,Judges Express Skepticism of SEC Arguments in Grayscale Bitcoin ETF Hearing,"A panel of judges appeared skeptical of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) arguments during an appeals court hearing in Grayscale's ongoing bid to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an exchange-traded fund (ETF).  The company went to court Tuesday to argue the SEC's denial of its ETF application was ""arbitrary,"" telling the panel of judges that Grayscale is ""asking to be regulated"" by the SEC through its conversion of GBTC to an ETF. Grayscale is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, CoinDesk's parent company.  Chief Judge Sri Srinivasan and Judges Neomi Rao and Harry Edwards of the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C., asked SEC Senior Counsel Emily Parise a number of questions about the agency's argument that bitcoin futures prices underlying futures ETFs were more resistant to manipulation than spot bitcoin markets might be if a spot bitcoin futures ETF was approved.  Judge Rao asked a number of questions about futures prices, contrasting with spot prices: ""It seems to me that [what] the Commission really needs to explain is how it understands the relationship between bitcoin futures and the spot price of bitcoin ... it seems to me that ... one is just essentially a derivative. They move together 99.9% of the time. So where's the gap, in the Commission's view?""  In the SEC's view, said Parise, the 99% correlation does not equate to causation, saying that figure only refers to once-a-day prices rather than intraday prices. She had earlier already mentioned that in the SEC's opinion, ""it is undisputed"" that spot markets for bitcoin are fragmented, in contrast with bitcoin futures, which trade solely on CME.  The other judges also asked a number of questions ranging from the legal defense by the SEC to how it evaluated the tests it used to reject Grayscale's bid.  The judges' apparent skepticism of the SEC's position is sending GBTC higher by 5% on Tuesday while the price of bitcoin is flat at $23,300. That's further narrowing the closed-end fund's discount to net asset value (NAV), which had fallen to a one-month low of 42% on Monday.

42412730,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl5vNY,1678204372,‘Tonight Show’s’ Jimmy Fallon Files to Be Removed From Subpoena in Bored Apes Trademark Case,"Lawyers for “The Tonight Show” host Jimmy Fallon filed a motion to quash a subpoena from conceptual artist Ryder Ripps on Monday, calling the move an “unwarranted fishing expedition for irrelevant material.”  Fallon is a non-party to Yuga Labs’ lawsuit against Ripps and Ripps' business partner, Jeremy Cahen. In June 2022, Yuga Labs sued the duo for trademark infringement, false advertising and unfair competition connected to the pair’s creation of a knockoff NFT collection mimicking Yuga’s popular Bored Ape Yacht Club non-fungible tokens.  Ripps and Cahen have posited that their collection was satirical art and thus protected from trademark-infringement claims – though the New York judge overseeing the case disagreed, calling their work “no more artistic than the sale of a counterfeit handbag.”  Though Fallon isn't a named party in the suit between the two men and Yuga Labs, he is a co-defendant in a parallel class-action suit filed in California against Yuga Labs and a host of celebrity promoters, claiming that the Bored Apes were “misleadingly promoted” and resulted in financial damage to the defendants.  Similarly, Ripps and Cohen’s defense in their separate suit rests on an assertion of Yuga Labs’ “unclean hands,” alleging that the company engaged in “various unlawful activities associated with the sale and promotion of BAYC NFTs including Yuga’s misuse of BAYC NFTs as securities, undisclosed compensation for endorsements from celebrities, and/or unlawful acts directed towards the defendants.”  Fallon has been requested to turn over documents relating to “Yuga’s cooperation with third parties aimed at popularizing BAYC NFTs” and “any agreements … in which a BAYC NFT is given, exchanged, or sold to a celebrity, influencer or any other public person.” Fallon mentioned his own Bored Ape on two episodes of ""The Tonight Show.""  Fallon’s lawyer, Dana Seshens, argued that the motion should be denied because it places an undue burden on Fallon, and the same documents and information have already been sought from Yuga Labs and its alleged agent, Hollywood talent agent Guy Oseary, who was accused in the class-action lawsuit of being the broker between celebrities and Yuga Labs.  Seshens also argued that the subpoena was procedurally improper, because it was signed by Ripps and Cahen’s lawyer, who “apparently is neither admitted to practice law in New York, Vermont or Connecticut, nor admitted to the bar of the Southern District of New York.”  “Courts in this district and elsewhere have recognized that this defect alone renders a subpoena fatally deficient on its face,” Seshens concluded.

That means the policymakers are open to raising rates higher than they previously expected. ""The latest economic data have come in stronger than expected, which suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated,"" Powell said. ""If the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes"" The central bankers continue to expect ongoing increases in its federal funds rate target range. Meanwhile, the Fed continues the process of shrinking its balance sheet, he said. In Tuesday morning trading, the S&P 500 slipped 0.9% , the Nasdaq -0.9% , and the Dow -0.6% . The 10-year Treasury yield rises almost 4 basis points to 4.00%. ""Powell's prepared remarks for his semi-annual testimony opened the door to a return of 50-bp hikes at the March meeting if the incoming data flow warrants it. Upside surprises to Friday's payroll report could drive a faster and longer tightening cycle,"" said Morgan Stanley Chief U.S. Economist Ellen Zentner. (added at 10:44 AM ET.) The probability of a 50 basis point rate increase jumped to 49.8% from 31.4% a day earlier, according to the CME FedWatch tool . As a result the probability of a 25-bp hike fell to 50.2% from 68.6%. 12:22 PM ET: Hearing ends. 12:21 PM ET : He says the Fed has been urging banks to be careful in dealing with crypto. ""It's early days with crypto...There isn't the appropriate regulation."" 12:19 PM ET: ""We have two or three more very important data releases"" before the Fed's next meeting, which will figure into its rate decision. 11:57 AM ET: Stablecoins could have a role in the U.S. financial system if they are subject to appropriate regulation. The U.S. needs a legal framework around digital activities, he added. 11:53 AM ET: The Fed does not consider the government's debt levels and interest costs when making monetary policy. The government can service its current debt, but its path of increasing debt is not sustainable, he said. 11:49 AM ET: There's a path to achieving 2% inflation without a significant increase in unemployment, he said. The labor market is so strong, there's the potential to reduce the number of job openings without putting a lot of people out of work. 11:39 AM ET: For years, the neutral level of interest (the point at which interest neither helps or hinders the economy) ""went down and down and down,"" Powell said. ""Honestly, we don't know"" where the neutral interest rate is. ""We don't think we need a significant increase in unemployment,"" to bring inflation down to its 2% goal. 11:34 AM ET: ""We have a narrow role to play"" in climate risk, Powell said. ""Our only focus is on the safety and soundness of institutions... we're not looking to be climate policymakers."" He vowed to be careful not to go down the ""slippery slope"" of implementing climate policy. 11:26 AM ET: Some softening in the labor market will have to happen to bring inflation down. All the recent data shows a labor market that is extremely tight, but ""I never said that it was the main cause"" of inflation, he said. 11:25 AM ET: There is no obvious candidate to replace the U.S. dollar as world reserve currency, he said. 11:17 AM ET: When Senator Elizabeth Warren asked what Powell would say to the 2M people who will lose their jobs at the end of 2023 as a result of rate hikes, he said, ""Inflation is extremely high and it's hurting the working people of this country badly. And we're using the only tool we have."" He said it would be worse to walk away and do nothing. 11:14 AM ET: Core inflation is running at 4.7% over the past 12 months, Powell said. ""Nothing in the data suggests that we have tightened too much."" Rather, it suggests that the Fed has more to do, he said. Powell declined to estimate what the Fed's terminal rate will be. The FOMC will issue new projections at the Fed's March 21-22 meeting. 11:07 AM ET: With office occupancy rates staying low, Powell spoke about the financial stability risk related to commercial real estate. The largest financial institutions don't have a large commercial real estate loan exposure, he said, but some smaller banks do. The Fed is monitoring that market. ""I would say we're on the case,"" Powell said. 10:55 AM ET: In speaking about the role of supply chain issues in inflation: ""The initial outbreak of inflation was all about spending on goods"" when people couldn't spend on services, Powell said. It has now spread to housing and services. He expects that housing services inflation will come down in the next six to 12 months. ""The source of inflation we have now is in other services, and that has very little to do with the supply chain,"" he said. 10:50 AM ET: The Fed isn't trying to raise the unemployment rate; rather, it's trying to bring supply and demand into balance, he said. 10:46 AM ET: The debt level is really a matter between the executive branch and Congress, Powell said. ""Congress really needs to raise the debt ceiling, that's really the only way out,"" he said. ""If we fail to do so, the consequences are hard to estimate... and could do lasting harm."" 10:41 AM ET: ""Core inflation has come down, but nowhere near as much as we had hoped,"" he said. 10:39 AM ET: The Fed does have the tools to bring inflation down to 2% over time, he said. 10:33 AM ET: ""We're very strongly committed to tailoring"" banks' capital requirements, Powell said. 10:31 AM ET: The Fed has been making sure that the financial institutions that it regulates are being careful in crypto assets, he said. On a separate subject, the Fed's Community Reinvestment Act revamp is ""some months away,"" he said. 10:30 AM ET: Powell confirmed that the Fed would keep banks' capital requirements strong. 10:28 AM ET: ""There is a mismatch between supply and demand,"" Powell said. And, ""there is a job for us to do"" in bringing that back into balance. While overall inflation has eased from its peak in June, ""there is little sign of disinflation thus far in the category of core services excluding housing, which accounts for more than half of core consumer expenditures,"" he said. To bring down inflation in that sector, ""there will very likely be some softening in labor market conditions,"" Powell said . ""The historical record cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy. We will stay the course until the job is done,"" he said. Developing.. check back for updates.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 1,046 −1.0 ▼ 0.1% Bitcoin (BTC) $22,370 −29.0 ▼ 0.1% Ethereum (ETH) $1,565 −0.8 ▼ 0.0% S&P 500 futures 4,055.25 +2.8 ▲ 0.1% FTSE 100 7,948.63 +18.8 ▲ 0.2% Treasury Yield 10 Years 3.98% ▲ 0.0 BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices, as of 7 a.m. ET (11 a.m. UTC)  Top Stories  The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) discount to the net asset value has fallen to its lowest level in a month ahead of oral arguments in federal court later Tuesday related to Grayscale Investments' lawsuitagainst the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Grayscale is appealing the SEC’s decision to deny the conversion of the trust into an exchange-traded fund. Known in crypto markets as the ""Grayscale discount,"" this key metric has narrowed to 42% at press time after hitting 47% in mid-February. According to data from TradeBlock, this is the trimmest discount since Feb. 7. “While far from a certainty, it is our view that the market is underpricing the likelihood of a Grayscale victory,” said Sean Farrell, vice president of digital-asset strategy at Fundstrat. Grayscale and CoinDesk are both owned by crypto conglomerate Digital Currency Group.  FTX sister company Alameda Research is suing crypto asset manager Grayscale Investments to seek injunctive relief for what it claims is over $250 million in asset value for the FTX debtor’s customers and creditors, according to a press release. The suit also asserts claims against Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein, Grayscale owner Digital Currency Group and DCG CEO Barry Silbert. According to the complaint, Grayscale has extracted exorbitant management fees for its management of the Grayscale Bitcoin and Ethereum trusts and has allowed those trusts’ shares to trade at roughly a 50% discount to their net asset value.  White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the Biden administration is monitoring Silvergate Bank's (SI) situation, comparing it with those at other crypto companies and saying President Joe Biden has called on Congress to take action in this area. During her White House press briefing Monday, Jean-Pierre said she couldn't speak to Silvergate specifically, but noted that a number of crypto companies have ""experience[d] significant issues"" in recent weeks and pointed to statements from federal bank regulators warning of the risk cryptocurrencies could pose to banks and other financial institutions.  Chart of the Day  The chart compares tether (USDT)-denominated bitcoin trading pairs' market share with U.S. dollar-denominated trading pairs since 2017.  The share of tether-denominated trading pairs has increased sharply since the collapse of crypto exchange FTX in November and reached a record high last week.  ""With the death of SEN, stablecoins will likely become even more ubiquitous among traders. Rather than deposit your dollars with an exchange, you deposit them with a stablecoin issuer, receive stablecoins and then transfer those to an exchange,"" Paris-based Kaiko said in a note on Monday. SEN was an interbank transfer network that was run by Silvergate Bank and that was widely used by crypto traders. It was discontinued last week as Silvergate faces doubts about its ability to stay afloat.  ""The problem is, though, that stablecoin issuers still need access to a crypto bank, so the risk is now further concentrated,"" Kaiko added.

42412732,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl5vRI,1678194529,Crypto Observers Look to Treasury Yields for Cues as Bitcoin Remains Comatose,"Bitcoin (BTC) has been trading dead flat since falling by 5% early Friday, and analysts are now looking to U.S. Treasurys for fresh directional cues.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value fell from $23,400 to $22,000 on Friday in a delayed reaction to issues at crypto-friendly Silvergate Bank. Since then, however, both bulls and bears have refused to lead the price action, leaving the cryptocurrency in a narrow range of $22,150 to $22,700, CoinDesk data shows.  The range play may end with a deeper sell-off should Treasury yields extend the February rally, denting the appeal of riskier assets like cryptocurrencies and technology stocks and perceived inflation hedges like gold. A rise in bond yields makes borrowing more expensive and typically sees traders ditch risky assets in favor of fixed-income securities, as seen last year.  ""Despite the gloom and doom, crypto continues to hold up extremely well, with BTC staying above $23,000,"" Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a research note published on Friday. ""However, if equities continue to fall and the dollar index and yields continue to move higher, crypto prices might struggle to sustain these levels.""  Yields, however, have pulled back slightly from the multi-month highs seen last week, offering relief to risky assets.  At press time, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note stood at 3.94%, down from the four-month high of 4.089% reached last week. The two-year yield, which is more sensitive to expectations for Federal Reserve interest rate hikes, hovered near 4.85%, after it reached a 16-year high of 4.94% on Thursday.  The pullback comes as Atlanta Federal Reserve President Raphael Bostic struck a balanced tone on Thursday, calling for a cautious approach while raising rates to control inflation. The central bank has raised rates by 450 basis points to the 4.5%-4.75% range since March 2022, destabilizing risky assets.  Bostic's tone probably forced rates traders to reassess their recent aggressive repricing of interest rate expectations. The forecasts for peak fed interest rate for the tightening cycle topped 5.5% last week, a notable jump from the 5% seen four weeks ago, according to the fed funds futures.  ""Adding to the positive momentum, the Fedspeak this past week has been somewhat balanced. Whilst maintaining the hawkish mantra that they stand ready to keep raising rates should data not show inflation clearly heading back to target, there’s also been a little more caution relative to recent market pricing,"" David Brickell, director of institutional sales at crypto liquidity network Paradigm, said in Tuesday's edition of Macro Pulse newsletter.  ""The Fed’s Bostic perhaps best captured this sentiment in saying, slow and steady is going to be the appropriate course of action,"" Brickell added, noting the subsequent pullback in yields.  One reason to expect a continued slide in yields is that hedge funds have recently placed record bets on higher two-year Treasury yields. Such extreme positioning is often observed at major turning points. In other words, the yields may be close to topping out, a positive development for crypto and other risky assets.  ""According to CFTC data, spec positioning in U.S. Treasurys is now at a record short, surpassing levels last seen in October 2018. U.S. yields topped out shortly after that and is an important consideration here given the negative impact rising yields exerts on risk and crypto,"" Brickell noted, referring to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  That said, the trend in yields largely depends on what Fed Chairman Jerome Powell says during his semiannual testimony before Congress this week and, more importantly, on Friday's jobs report and the February inflation data due on March 14.  Powell is likely to reiterate his commitment to fighting inflation with rate hikes. The hawkish talk, however, may not have much impact on the market, considering interest rate expectations have already been repriced higher.  ""Given hawkish market pricing, it's a high bar for Powell to reach,"" Brickell tweeted. ""He's talking to Congress and will need to be more measured with due caution for the downside.""",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/03/07/crypto-observers-look-to-treasury-yields-for-cues-as-bitcoin-remains-comatose,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3ba10d21601964e1d9f6bf2809d12f2e6a488115-4032x3024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42412751,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl5x2S,1678180155,Ether Call Options Look Attractive Relative to Bitcoin as Volatility Spread Dwindles: Matrixport,"Trading cryptocurrencies is quite challenging right now because the market is caught between opposing forces of issues at crypto-friendly bank Silvergate, operational bottlenecks at major exchanges and optimism about Ethereum's impending Shanghai upgrade.  Per crypto services provider Matrixport, the best way to navigate the melee is by setting relative value trades – a strategy of trading one or more securities in relation to another.  ""It's time for relative value trades. Traders can now buy call options on ether and finance them by selling calls on bitcoin with the profit potential quite strong,"" Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at Matrixport, said in a note to clients on Tuesday. ""This allows traders to buy a high-volatility asset (ether) for the price of a lower-volatility asset (bitcoin).""  Options are derivative contracts that give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call option gives the right to buy, while the put option confers the right to sell.  Buying a call/put option is akin to purchasing insurance against bullish/bearish moves. The buyer compensates the seller for offering protection by paying a premium while taking the trade.  Matrixport's suggestion involves collecting a premium by selling a bitcoin (BTC) call option and using the same to fund the purchase of an ether (ETH) call option.  The trade idea is based on the assumption that the spread between the annualized 30-day realized or historical volatility of ether and bitcoin would bounce from the current unusually low level. That, coupled with the upcoming Ethereum Shanghai upgrade, would make ether calls pricier relative to bitcoin calls.  ""The volatility spread between ether and bitcoin has compressed to below 1. This has only occasionally happened and the spread has traded above 1 in 93% of the observations during the past four years,"" Thielen noted.  Volatility is mean-reverting and has a positive impact on options prices. In other words, periods of unusually low volatility are followed by increased price turbulence, which, in turn, boosts demand for options, making them pricier. Thus, traders tend to buy options when volatility is lower than its long-term average.  The spread between ether and bitcoin realized volatility gauges looks undervalued relative to its historical standards and could mean-revert as we head into the Shanghai upgrade, which is expected to bring price turbulence.  ""The spread has averaged 1.39 over the year and offers great risk/reward potential here,"" Thielen noted, explaining the rationale behind purchasing ETH calls by selling BTC calls.  The Shanghai upgrade, a backward-incompatible hard fork due sometime in the coming weeks, will open withdrawals of ether staked in the Ethereum network since December 2020. The upgrade will de-risk staking and increase capital efficiency, opening doors for more investor participation and perhaps ether price gain.  ""A wave of new participants who had previously been watching from the sidelines can potentially add a level of buying pressure to ETH, especially if institutional capital can be enticed,"" Binance Research said in a report last month.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | FORKS,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/03/07/ether-call-options-look-attractive-relative-to-bitcoin-as-shanghai-upgrade-nears,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a7a4f886f8d5c0a1d7db0fd1a734e6ed8d759d3c-1919x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42412740,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl5wsA,1678170656,"FTX Bankruptcy Special Counsel, Advisers Bill $38M for January","The army of professionals working on the FTX bankruptcy case has billed a collective $38 million plus expenses for the month of January, according to court records.  Bankruptcy administrators have retained law firm Sullivan & Cromwell as counsel. They have also retained Quinn Emmanuel Urquhart & Sullivan as well as Landis Rath & Cobb to act as special counsel for the proceedings.  Consultancy AlixPartners was retained to primarily conduct forensic analysis on decentralized finance (DeFi) products and tokens in FTX’s possession.  Meanwhile, the financial services firms Alvarez & Marsal as well as Perella Weinberg Partners were retained to sort through FTX’s accounting records and determine which assets it can sell.  According to court filings, Sullivan & Cromwell billed $16.8 million for January while Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan billed $1.4 million and Landis Rath & Cobb billed $663,995.  Collectively, the three firms have over 180 lawyers assigned to the case and over 50 nonlawyer staff such as paralegals.  Court filings show Sullivan & Cromwell lawyers and staff billed a total of 14,569 hours for January. The largest project Sullivan & Cromwell worked on was discovery, followed by asset disposition and asset analysis and recovery.  Initially the U.S. Department of Justice had objected to FTX hiring Sullivan & Cromwell, claiming potential conflicts of interest. Former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried also objected to bankruptcy administrators hiring the firm, claiming that the law firm's staff had pressured him into filing for bankruptcy protection in November. In late January the firm was approved by a U.S. bankruptcy court judge in Delaware to continue to represent FTX.  In early February, Sullivan & Cromwell submitted a bill for $7.5 million for the first 19 days of bankruptcy work after FTX filed in November.  The majority of billed time for Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan was spent on Asset Analysis and Recovery as well as Avoidance Action – legalese for attempts to undo certain transactions that the debtor engaged in before bankruptcy.  For Landis Rath & Cobb, a significant amount of time was billed for hearings, litigation and asset disposition.  AlixPartners billed $2.1 million for 2,454 hours of work.  Investment bank Perella Weinberg Partners billed $450,000 (its monthly fee), and court documents show it spent a significant amount of time on developing a restructuring strategy as well as correspondence with third parties.  According to its billing breakdown, the bank spent a large amount of time working on the sale of FTX assets LedgerX and FTX Japan. In January, a bankruptcy judge gave the sale the green light in order to create liquidity to pay back creditors.  Alvarez & Marsal billed $12.3 million, the second-largest charge for the month behind Sullivan & Cromwell. Some of the largest items it billed for were Avoidance Actions, at 3,370 hours, financial analysis, at 1,168 hours and accounting at 1,106 hours.  In November, shortly after FTX declared bankruptcy, CEO John J. Ray III said the crypto exchange had a “complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information.”  Ray, who oversaw the liquidation of Enron and Nortel Networks, called the FTX situation “unprecedented” and something he had never seen in his career.

SEC senior trial attorney William Uptegrove said Friday that SEC staff believed Binance.US may be operating an unregistered securities exchange in the U.S., an assertion to which Binance.US objected. On Monday, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Michael Wiles, of New York's Southern District Bankruptcy Court, asked SEC senior trial attorney Therese Scheuer whether Binance.US or Voyager could have known about this claim prior to Friday.  He also indicated the SEC objection may not be enough to warrant a delay in approving the deal.  ""Bankruptcy Code doesn't contemplate an endless period of time,"" the judge said. ""Things have to be done. We have creditors who are waiting and who in the midst of all this uncertainty have no access to property in which they've invested in some cases their life savings, so we have to take some kind of action. We have to do something.""  Read more: Voyager Denies SEC Claims VGX Token Is a Security as Binance.US Decision Looms  The judge said the parties were trying to give the SEC its regulatory freedom ""to the extent that it makes sense"" but the bankruptcy itself was more urgent. The bankruptcy hearing entered its third day on Monday. While the first two days of the hearing focused on questioning various people tied to Voyager, Binance.US and others involved in the proposed deal, day three was more focused on any objections to the plan itself.  Scheuer objected to some of the disclosures made within the proposal, including a lack of clarity around possible regulatory concerns. The judge appeared to take issue with this point.  ""I have no idea how long I can do nothing and wait until Congress and the competing regulatory authority sort out amongst themselves, just who has what authority over what aspects of this, what kind of authority. I have no idea how long that's going to take and we can't do that in bankruptcy,"" he said. ""... [W]e can't just put everything on pause just because we don't know for sure how the regulators will eventually make up their minds on points that they seem to have been debating for years.""  Representatives from the U.S. Trustee's office, the Texas Attorney General's office and the New York Department of Financial Services also weighed in during the hearing.

Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Crypto is flat as traders await U.S. central bank Chair Jerome Powell's next comments.  Insights: Exposure to China and the subsidies it is receiving may be hurting Filecoin's growth.

Bitcoin and ether are opening the Asia business day flat. The world’s largest digital asset is down 0.2% to $22,412 while ether is stuck at $1,565.  Trading volume is significantly down, according to CoinGecko data, with 24-hour volume for bitcoin at $16 billion on Monday, March 6 compared to $27 billion on Friday, March 3.  A report from CryptoQuant points to funding rates and argues that the current market is bearish and betting on further declines.  “I don’t think we’re out of the woods yet, clearly inflation is still both rampant and here,” Hany Rashwan, CEO of crypto investment product firm 21.co, said on CoinDesk TV. “How much the market has priced that in right now is difficult to show.”  All eyes are likely on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell as he heads to Congress to testify Tuesday morning before the Senate Banking Committee and on Wednesday to the House Financial Services panel.  Powell is in a predicament because the economy seems resistant to the cooling effects of interest rate hikes.  January’s blow-out job numbers, where the U.S. added nearly three-times as many jobs as expected, showed observers that the Fed has some work to do to bring down inflation.

Of these 13.41 exabytes, 626 petabytes (1 petabyte is 1,000 terabytes) are currently used.  The $2.4 billion question is, what is stored within these 626 petabytes?  On one hand, that’s easy to answer. When asked, the Filecoin Foundation is quick to provide a table listing out some high-profile clients:  There’s plenty of data archived on Filecoin from scientific or historical projects. Atlas CERN stores 10,240 tebibytes (equal to 11,258 terabytes) of data from the Large Hadron Collider on the Filecoin Network; the USC Shoah Foundation stores 3,046 tebibytes (this is because of a $2 million grant from the Filecoin Foundation); the Internet Archive stores 503 tebibytes (another grant, this time worth $10 million); University of California Berkeley stores 121 tebibytes.  The only commercial entities on the list are a China-based post-production house called XingChi Media, which says it's backing up data on Filecoin for disaster recovery, and NFT.Storage, which is a product of Protocol Labs – the organization which supports Filecoin’s code.  A spokesperson for Protocol Labs also highlighted that non-fungible token marketplace OpenSea stores the metadata for its NFTs on Filecoin. Important, yes, for the continuity of the NFT industry in the face of disaster but not exactly something that requires a lot of storage.  Filecoin’s China centralization  There’s no question that the Filecoin protocol is being used and demand for storage is increasing.  On-chain data shows that the daily active Filecoin deals are trending upward.  But perhaps the reason you don’t see a large number of actual enterprise-grade clients using Filecoin – and just scientific data repositories and proof-of-concept initiatives – is because of Filecoin’s heavy exposure to China.  In 2021, miners in China jumped on the ability to add Filecoin to the mix, with billions being spent in buying up hard disks, which are to Filecoin what GPUs were to Ethereum, and building out facilities.  Bella Yang, a research manager with IDC China’s enterprise research team, told CoinDesk in a note that Filecoin miners were buying a large number of storage servers known as JBODs. These are uncomplicated arrays of HDDs designed to scale a company’s ability to archive data quickly.  “During this time, a large number of JBOD products were sold directly to mining companies and prices of high-capacity HDDs began to rise, even driving many out of stock when there was a shortage of 8 terabyte-plus HDDs,” Yang said, explaining that the Filecoin-induced demand for HDDs came as COVID-19 closed factories in China.  Although bitcoin mining has largely left China, and ether mining has been made redundant with the Merge, Filecoin miners still have a large presence in-country.  A 2022 study by Italy’s University of Pisa showed Filecoin's large degree of centralization around its top 10 miners, many of which are based in China and owned by cloud storage companies.  “The fact that the most important miners are linked to cloud storage companies highlights that Filecoin is far from being concretely decentralized market storage because these companies are dominating the storage market and monopolizing the mining operations,” the authors wrote.  Filecoin knows the market is skeptical  For Filecoin, the answer to its woes is Filecoin Plus (FIL+), which seeks to carve out quality storage providers from the ones that pollute the protocol with junk data, which many miners in China were doing in the early days of the protocol.  It also allows users, perhaps ironically, to pick their storage provider. Centralization is a cure for decentralization’s pitfalls.  All this is coming at a cost, as CoinDesk has previously reported, with massive subsidies required in the form of a 10x larger block reward to make Filecoin Plus work.  Data from Token Terminal shows that revenue for the protocol has imploded during the last year despite more use of the protocol. In February, heavy incentives meant that earnings were a net negative to the tune of $43.4 million against revenue of $1.2 million.  “What I think is going to be the most important thing to watch there is if the storage demand can still keep up when storing data is no longer free,” Messari enterprise research analyst Sami Kassab said earlier to CoinDesk.
