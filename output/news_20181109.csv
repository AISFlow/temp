42402146,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3ZlR,1541794543,Colorado Regulators Crack Down on Four More ICOs,"Colorado regulators took action against four ICOs Thursday, bringing the state's total number of cease-and-desist orders against crypto startups to 12.  The state's ""ICO Task Force"" rebuked Bitcoin Investments, Ltd, PinkDate, Prisma and Clear Shop Vision Ltd. Where the companies are based is unclear, a spokeswoman for Colorado's Division of Securities told CoinDesk, though the unregistered securities they promoted were available to Colorado residents.  Colorado Securities Commissioner Gerald Rome told CoinDesk:  ""We want to ensure that the state's securities market and the investors that operate within it are protected from unscrupulous actors that are taking advantage of the enthusiasm surrounding this field to perpetrate fraud and in some cases outright theft. There are many companies in Colorado that are working hard to conduct their ICOs the right way, and we are eager to continue working with them to build a regulatory framework for the industry as it relates to securities.""  Rome added that the enforcement action is meant to advance Colorado as an ""innovative leader"" in the cryptocurrency space. Though the state's ICO Task Force has been active since May, the cease-and-desist orders come just days after Colorado elected a crypto-friendly governor in Congressional Blockchain Caucus member Jared Polis.  More U.S. state regulators are taking action against potentially fraudulent token sales. Earlier this week Texas issued emergency cease-and-desist orders to crypto mining firms based in Australia and Canada.  As CoinDesk reported in August, a coalition of North American securities regulators is conducting more than 200 investigations. The so-called ""Operation Cryptosweep"" – which the Colorado Division of Securities is participating in – is meant to stifle cryptocurrency scams.  ""You're starting to see now the results of those investigations,"" said Bob Webster of the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA), which is playing a coordinating role in the Cryptosweep effort.  Webster says Colorado is among the more active jurisdictions in the U.S., along with Texas, North Dakota and Massachusetts.  Anthony Tu-Sekine, who heads up the cryptocurrency arm of law firm Seward & Kissel LLC, says a number of state regulators are jumping into the fray to combat what are often ""thinly disguised Ponzi schemes.""

42402162,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3a1B,1541787772,The 'Coinbase Effect' Turns Bearish After BAT Prices Drop Post-Listing,"The price of browser startup Brave's Basic Attention Token (BAT) fell by as much as 20 percent in the past 24 hours.  Trading for BAT officially went live yesterday on Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the U.S., a move that followed the token's inclusion on Coinbase's professional platform.  Coinbase initially teased the idea of listing BAT among four other cryptocurrencies on July 13, triggering a 27 percent jump in its price at the time. BAT was able to reach a 3-month high of $0.45 just 11 days later.  Yet as of press time, BAT is trading at around $0.30, representing a 23 percent decline from than yesterday's high of $0.39.  BAT/USD Daily chart  As can be seen in the above chart, the price of BAT broke above its upper Bollinger Band and hit a three-month high of $0.39 following the Coinbase listing news, though it quickly retreated.  In technical analysis, a price extending above its Bollinger Band is usually a sign of overextension. When combined with an overbought relative strength index (RSI), a pullback becomes more likely as a result.  Given yesterday's bearish candle close, it's possible that BAT's descent is not complete. The middle of the Bollinger Band – known as the basis (middle red-line) – can now be looked to for short-term support.  Falling below the basis would set scope for a further drop to the bottom Bollinger Band where support confluence with the 0.618 Fibonacci lies near $0.22.  Selling the news?  It's worth noting BAT's bearish reaction from the market, following its listing on Coinbase, is not the first time a similar situation has taken place.  ZRX and ETC were two other cryptocurrencies added to the exchange this year that were met with initial investor enthusiasm but fell shortly after their official listing on the exchange.  ZRX became the most recent addition to Coinbase when it was listed on October 16th. Its price rose to an 8-week high of $1.09 the next day, but it began a steep descent thereafter.  Today, ZRX is trading at a price of $0.72 on the Binance exchange, representing a 33 percent drop from its post-Coinbase listing high.  In the frame below, the price action of ETC tells a similar story. The cryptocurrency hit a high of $15.09 on Aug.16, the day of its listing on Coinbase, but just a week later it was trading at a 20 percent lower price. Today, ETC is trading on Binance at a price of about $9.55, marking a 37 percent drop from its Aug. 16 high.  View:  BAT looks to be another victim of the ""buy the rumor, sell the news"" trading strategy following its listing on Coinbase.  Yesterday's bearish daily close hints at a further pullback in the coming days towards the Bollinger Band basis line where it may find temporary support, currently located at $0.28.  Finding acceptance below the basis would set scope for a drop to the bottom band where the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement lies near $0.22.

It continued, for emphasis, ""all fiat (USD, GBP, JPY, EUR) withdrawals are processing, and have been, as usual.""  This communication came on the heels of an announcement the previous week, in which the exchange responded to what it called ""online rumors,"" saying that ""Bitfinex is not insolvent.""  As CoinDesk reported at the time, however, several customers complained on social media that their cryptocurrency and fiat withdrawals were delayed.  Just over three weeks later, users are still saying they haven't received their money despite the long wait. CoinDesk sent multiple requests for comment to Bitfinex over two days but did not receive responses to questions.  ""I am still waiting for my money – 17 business days after the event,"" one customer, Jamie West, told CoinDesk Wednesday. ""They even had the cheek to charge £309 for 24-hour express service,"" he added.  West included the text of an email he said he'd received from Bitfinex customer support, which explained: ""for the wire itself, it could take 5-15 business days to fully process and reach the receiving bank account. Please note that transactions may be subject to slight delays based on the processing times of the banks involved.""  Addressing the additional ""express"" charge, a Bitfinex representative wrote: ""Express means that we are sending out the wire instructions to the bank within 24 hours after approval on business days. It does not reflect the processing time or procedure on the bank side.""  According to a Reddit post, West (going by the handle Jme247) initiated the withdrawal on Oct. 15.  CoinDesk spoke to seven other Bitfinex customers who have waited weeks to receive fiat withdrawals, or have given up and canceled their withdrawals. When specified, the amounts held up were generally in the tens of thousands of dollars.  One user, who asked to remain anonymous, shared screenshots of an email exchange with Bitfinex support, showing that they'd begun a withdrawal on Oct. 3. This user received a message from customer service, saying the money had been sent to a payment processor on Oct. 15.  Yet when asked if they'd received their money on Tuesday, the person told CoinDesk: ""Not yet. Still waiting for a response.""  ""Not received yet,"" a Reddit user going by GrossBit told CoinDesk Tuesday, referring to a nearly $11,000 withdrawal they previously said had been ""marked as completed"" on Oct. 18.  Jannie Pretorious told CoinDesk he'd requested a withdrawal on Oct. 10. ""Till date,"" he said on Nov. 8, ""nothing.""  Another user, going by saloprj, stands out for his tenacity. According to screenshots shared with CoinDesk, he initiated a $99,900 withdrawal on Oct. 8, which Bitfinex marked ""completed"" on Oct. 12. But as of Wednesday, he had not received his money.  It certainly wasn't for lack of trying. He emailed Bitfinex Support on Oct. 22, Oct. 29 (twice), Oct. 31, Nov. 1, Nov. 2, Nov. 3 and Nov. 5. He messaged Bitfinex Telegram admins, who work for the exchange, on Oct. 31 and Nov. 6.  No dice. ""All they tell me [is] I have to wait,"" saloprj wrote to CoinDesk.  CoinDesk also reached out to several other people who posted to Reddit and Telegram about delayed fiat withdrawals, but they did not reply.  'Remain patient'  For the most part, Bitfinex has been responsive to customer complaints about delayed withdrawals, but responsiveness has not always translated into users receiving their funds.  On Reddit and Telegram, a forum moderator (and Bitfinex employee) usually apologizes and asks for a ticket number. The conversation generally doesn't proceed much further in public.  But saloprj's correspondence, which he shared with CoinDesk, is revealing.  The earliest reply from Bifinex that he shared – which does not appear to be his first communication with the exchange – said:  ""Please be informed that as this matter is with the correct person from the correct department, the matter is no longer with frontline support. Therefore replies and responses to queries that are with second level or specialised department will not be in the same timeframes as a reply from front line support.""  The employee added that they'd personally followed up with someone from the department named above. This department, it would appear from subsequent emails, is the ""finance team"" who, saloprj was assured on Oct. 29, would ""provide a response as soon as possible.""  On Oct. 30 a Bitfinex employee told saloprj that his withdrawal had ""been given the status of completed on the 12th of October. Please note that this status does not indicate that the money should be in your bank, but rather that all relevant data was sent to the bank who will further process the transaction.""  The representative asked saloprj to wait until 15 business days had passed from the time the withdrawal was marked as ""completed,"" adding: ""[we] ask of you that you remain patient.""  On Nov. 3, the 16th business day since Bitfinex marked the withdrawal complete, saloprj wrote: ""please return find [sic] on my account or provide proof they was send.""  The response he received three hours later – the last one he'd gotten as of Nov. 7 – was notably candid:  ""The finance department has been inundated with requests recently. Our new deposit system has not been fully integrated yet and as a result our previous correspondent bank is finalising some of the outstanding withdrawals which has created a backlog.""  Bitfinex paused fiat deposits for some customers on Oct. 11. In a subsequent announcement, the exchange said it was ""working to implement a new and increasingly robust fiat deposit system to be available […] by Tuesday, October 16, 2018.""  Other customers said they'd been informed that a company called Crypto Capital was handling their withdrawal.  A customer who wished to remain anonymous provided a screenshot of an email in which a Bitfinex representative told them: ""Your funds is processing on Crypto Capital Corp., they may take more time to settle the remittance. We can submit your request if you would like to cancel the withdrawal request.""  CoinDesk reached out to Crypto Capital, but a support manager said only: ""We do not comment on the status of our clients.""  A screenshot of a Crypto Capital email posted to Reddit describes ""an extreme backlog in transfers,"" but a Bitfinex admin on Reddit said that, according to the finance team, ""this email was only sent to exclusive customers of Crypto Capital Corp and it does not apply to our clients that don't have an account with them.""  Crypto Capital did not respond to a request to verify the email's authenticity.  Turning to crypto  At least a few customers have given up on fiat withdrawals, canceling them and in some cases taking their money out of Bitfinex using cryptocurrency instead.  A customer going by k_stoyanov posted a long narrative to Reddit, describing a three-week wait for their money (including correspondence with Crypto Capital). In the end, according to a follow-up post, they'd withdrawn the money in bitcoin, sent it to Kraken, and withdrawn euros from that exchange.  ""This was the only option for me,"" they added.  As for the experience withdrawing euros from Kraken, k_stoyanov told CoinDesk they'd done it four times, and ""always within the same day I've been getting the money."" Another Bitfinex user mentioned on Reddit that their Coinbase Pro and Kraken withdrawals are ""banked WITHIN 24 hours.""  A customer going by BFXFan said they'd requested four U.S. dollar withdrawals between Oct. 2 and Oct. 15. None arrived, despite being marked ""completed"" by the exchange, and on Nov. 1 BFXFan wrote: ""I have given up on the transfer."" They canceled the withdrawal, telling CoinDesk, ""I took the quick way out.""  A customer going by Pikrachou wrote that he'd contacted Crypto Capital directly to cancel his Bitfinex withdrawals after waiting around a week, telling CoinDesk, ""I didn't try to wait when I saw it can take months.""  On Thursday, Anibal Santaella wrote on the Bitfinex Telegram channel: ""After 36 days with my funds in nowhere land (fiat withdrawal), the funds have been credited back to my Bitfinex account today."" He added that ""I wrote email to Crypto Capital and they returned the funds.""  To be sure, some customers are still receiving fiat withdrawals.  In a thread titled ""Don't forget to post when fiat withdrawals are successful,"" one user said they'd received funds from a Sept. 14 withdrawal on Nov. 5. Another user said they'd received theirs after three weeks.  Alongside those two comments, however, the thread included a third user, who said their withdrawal had been pending for 15 business days and ""support no longer reply my message.""  A professional trader who frequently uses Bitfinex – and asked not to be named – told CoinDesk: ""We have received withdrawals plenty of times over the last month."" He added that ""they're definitely flowing,"" though ""they've taken longer than usual to arrive.""  ""This is a very large client for a new bank,"" he said, which could explain the backlog of withdrawal requests. Bitfinex is apparently banking with the Bahamas-based Deltec Bank & Trust, which recently confirmed its relationship with Tether, a controversial stablecoin issuer that shares common owners and managers with Bitfinex.  ""I think it will figure itself out,"" the trader said.

42402157,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3ZxF,1541781114,Ethereum Sets Tentative January Goal for Next Blockchain Upgrade,"Developers are eyeing January 16th as the date on which Constantinople, ethereum's upcoming network hard fork, could launch.  The upgrade for the world's second-largest blockchain was originally targeted for November, bringing with it a host of design changes aimed at streamlining the platform's code in a bid to boost performance. Yet the November launch window was ultimately due to unanticipated problems with the test release, necessitating a longer development period.  While the Jan. 16 date was reached by way of a non-binding verbal agreement, it's not fixed or final. Indeed, developers on Friday's bi-weekly call said that Constantinople could be postponed further should additional problems arise.  ""We can just say mid-January, it doesn't make difference if we decide on a date or not. We can always postpone,"" core developer Péter Szilágyi remarked.  Also during the call, developer Lane Rettig shared research regarding ethereum's so-called ""difficulty bomb."" The difficulty bomb is an algorithm embedded within ethereum's code that makes blocks steadily harder to mine, and was put in place to act as an incentive for encouraging regular updates to the network.  According to Rettig, the difficulty bomb will be noticeable from January, leading to 30-second block times by April or May of next year.  ""So we have time, there's no critical concern,"" Rettig said.  Constantinople  delays the difficulty bomb for a further 18 months, while also decreasing the ethereum mining reward from 3 ETH to 2 ETH per block. Additionally, the upgrade features various optimizations to the underlying ethereum code.  Whether ProgPoW – a change that would standardize ethereum mining to general-purpose hardware only, blocking specialized ASIC miners – will be considered for inclusion Constantinople was not discussed during the call. However, developers reported issues regarding its implementation, stating that the formal specification of the code is incomplete.  On that subject specifically, Szilágyi urged that Constantinople software upgrades that will implement the hard fork should be released before the end of the year.  ""All clients should release a stable version with the baked in block number before Christmas,"" Szilágyi said.

42402159,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3ZwG,1541769039,"Malaysian Government, Universities Team to Put Degrees on a Blockchain","Malaysia's education ministry has formed a new consortium of universities to harness blockchain tech in tackling the massive industry in fake certificates.  The Ministry of Education announced in a press release posted on Twitter Thursday, that alongside the new consortium of six universities, it has launched a blockchain-based system called e-Scroll for the issuance and verification of university degrees.  The solution, it said, was prompted by a rise in cases of fraudulent degrees and the ease with which they can be obtained over the internet.  Citing a BBC Radio report describing a ""staggering"" trade in fake degree certificates from January, the MoE said ""buyers are prepared to spend up to half a million pounds on bogus documents,"" adding that, ""such a scenario is also not unheard of in Malaysia.""  The ministry said the idea of a blockchain-based system was first introduced in January by the Council of ICT Deans, and it is expected to improve efficiency, alongside proving certificate provenance.  The release states that Malaysian universities currently receive ""thousands of requests globally"" to verify graduates – a process still largely done via telephone and emails, ""which contribute to its inefficiency.""  Developed by a team from the International Islamic University (IIUM), the MoE said the system stores the certificate data on the NEM blockchain and provides an online verification ""in a few seconds"" when a QR code printed on the degree certificate is scanned.  For the first phase of the project, PhD students from IIUM graduating on Nov. 10 will have their degree certificates logged on the system. The ministry said it is encouraging other universities to join the consortium.  ""Although, such a system can also be built using other blockchains, NEM was chosen due to its unique features in managing traceability and authentication requirements,"" it added.

Initiating the court actions on behalf of clients that have lost funds to criminals that used the increasingly common method of infiltrating mobile devices to access cryptocurrency wallets and two-factor authentication codes, the firm alleges:  ""By leaving holes in their security protocols and failing to properly train and monitor their employees, cellphone providers have assisted thieves in remotely taking over the SIM cards in people's smartphones, accessing financial records and account information of the victims, and emptying the victim's accounts of cryptocurrency and other valuable assets.""  In a press release published Friday, Silver Miller said that one client, an AT&T customer, had had over $621,000 of cryptocurrency stolen via a SIM swap attack. The firm further alleges that the breach occurred after AT&T ""had assured him it had increased security on his account following an earlier attempted hack.""  Other cases have been filed against T-Mobile, with Silver Miller alleging that two clients had been robbed of $400,000 and $250,000, respectively, via SIM swaps ""permitted"" by the telcom firm.  While the service exists for legitimate reasons, such as SIM card damage or switching providers, SIM swapping can also allow criminals to arrange for a telecoms company to reassign a user's account to another SIM, allowing full access to all calls, messages and notifications.  Silver Miller said that all it takes for a swap to be arranged ""a persuasive plea for assistance, a willing telecommunications carrier representative, and an electronic impersonation of the victim.""  In a recent report from Krebs on Security, the REACT Task Force in California indicated that SIM swapping is rapidly increasing as a popular tool for hackers.  Samy Tarazi, a sergeant at the Santa Clara County Sheriff's office and a REACT supervisor, was quoted as saying:  ""For the amounts being stolen and the number of people being successful at taking it, the numbers are probably historic.

42402144,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3XUk,1541762174,Bitcoin Price Eyes $6.2K Amid Further Drop into Bear Territory,"Bitcoin's (BTC) reversal of the recent uptrend in prices is gathering pace and a drop into a bearish territory below $6,200 is now a possibility, technical charts indicate.  The leading cryptocurrency found acceptance below the lower edge of the rising channel yesterday, invalidating the bullish price action witnessed earlier this week. Essentially, the rally from the Oct. 31 low of $6,201 has ended at a high of $6,540 reached on Nov. 7.  At press time, BTC is trading at $6,350 on Coinbase, having clocked a five-day low of $6,335 soon before press time, following a sudden $100 drop.  The negative follow through to yesterday's bullish channel breakdown is an indication that the bears are likely feeling emboldened, having pulled down prices by 2.9 percent from weekly highs.  As a result, the support of the trendline from Oct. 11 lows could be breached in the next few hours, opening the doors for a drop below the recent higher low of $6,200 (Oct. 31).  Hourly chart  As can be seen above, the cryptocurrency has established a bearish lower highs and lower lows pattern, validating yesterday's bullish channel breakdown.  Further, prices seem to have found acceptance under the crucial 200-hour exponential moving average (EMA) support and the major EMAS – 50, 100 and 200 – are beginning to roll over in favor of the bears.  In particular, the 50-hour looks set to cross the 100-hour EMA from above, bolstering the already bearish technical setup.  The drop below the immediate support of $6,330 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement), however, is likely to happen after a minor bout of consolidation, as the relative strength index (RSI) is reporting oversold conditions below 30.00.  Daily chart  Over on the daily chart, the symmetrical triangle breakout and a close above the critical 50-day EMA resistance witnessed earlier this week failed to produce significant price gains.  A failed breakout often ends up putting the bears back into the driver's seat. Hence, a slide to $6,200 could be in the offing.  View  A combination of the failed breakout on the daily chart and the bearish setup on the hourly chart indicates that cryptocurrency could soon drop below $6,274 (trendline connecting the Oct. 11 low and Oct. 31 low + 76.4 percent Fibonacci retracement support) and drop below $6,200 (Oct. 31 low).  A UTC close below $6,200 would invalidate the higher lows pattern seen on the daily chart, shifting risk in favor of a drop to the psychological support of $6,000.  A bullish revival is seen only above the weekly high of $6,540.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

Another PDVSA tweet shows a news clip of Quevedo talking on the subject, captioned with the quote:  ""Petro will become the digital currency of oil transactions worldwide; we will present it to OPEC, it is one of the internationalization measures of the currency.""  The move is aimed to enable Venezuela to start using the token to market its oil from the first quarter of next year, according to a report from Prensa Latina, the state news agency of Cuba.  Quevedo believes the move will help improve the country's economy and ""guarantee"" growth and prosperity.  Companies interested in Venezuelan oil products have been asked to join the country's national cryptocurrency platform, the report states. Quevedo has reportedly invited airlines and shipping companies to register for a digital wallet to transact in the petro.  ""The gasoline for planes, ships, we will be selling it in Petros. It is the currency of Venezuela,"" he was quoted as saying by Chinese news agency Xinhuanet.  Venezuela started the sale of petro to its residents on Oct. 29 via an official government portal, saying the token must be used for those seeking to obtain passports.

VersaBank Director of Investor Relations Wade MacBain told CoinDesk that the bank has already received over 200 inquiries about VersaVault.  In a statement, VersaBank CEO David Taylor added:  ""While many are considering ideas and plans for a digital safety deposit box, we have designed and built it, and are now commercializing a first of its kind service that provides our clients with the most sophisticated security and authentication technology available globally, in which our clients enjoy absolute privacy.""  The product was first announced in January 2018, and the bank, Canada's smallest by assets, signed on two beta users in March.

42402136,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3XNr,1541723720,Judge Lifts Order to Freeze Charlie Shrem's Assets in Winklevoss Case,"Early bitcoin supporter and entrepreneur Charlie Shrem has won his first battle in an ongoing lawsuit filed against him by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss and their firm, Winklevoss Capital Fund.  According to a court document filed Thursday by federal Judge Jed Rakoff, of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, a $30 million attachment initially granted against Shrem was lifted after a hearing earlier in the day.  The attachment order, which was granted on Oct. 2 but remained under seal until Oct. 26, allowed the U.S. Marshal for the Southern District to freeze assets belonging to Shrem.  The order included instructions for Xapo, Coinbase, Poloniex, Bittrex and other exchanges and financial institutions to freeze any assets up to 5,000 bitcoin or their equivalent value that they had in their possession which belonged to Shrem.  Not that there would have been much to freeze from those companies. Coinbase, Xapo, Digital Asset Holdings, Branch Banking and Trust Company, Noble Markets and ItBit all submitted statements saying they did not have any funds belonging to Shrem, while Poloniex (part of Circle Internet Financial) said it held $0.41 in bitcoin in an account belonging to Shrem, and Bittrex held roughly $4.44 combined in bitcoin and a fork currency called bitcoin gold.  ""After careful consideration, the Court denies plaintiff's motion to confirm the order of attachment and therefore lifts the attachment currently in place, effective immediately,"" Judge Rakoff wrote Thursday.  ""An opinion explaining the reasons for this ruling will issue in due course,"" he added, though he did not provide a timeline for when that opinion may be issued. No further documents were publicly available as of press time.  Brian Klein, an attorney representing Shrem, told CoinDesk via email that the ruling ""is an important first step towards [Shrem's] complete vindication.""  ""We are very pleased the judge ruled in [Shrem's] favor, dissolving the $30 million-plus attachment order after he heard extensive argument from both sides earlier today,"" he wrote.  Going to trial  The matter is not ending, however: a separate filing indicates that the case will proceed to a jury trial on April 8, 2019.  A case management plan notes that the parties to the case have until Nov. 15 to amend any pleadings, request documents and file any questions they may have.  The plan further notes that expert witnesses must submit any legally mandated disclosures by February or March, depending on whether they intend to support a claim or oppose a claim, respectively.  Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, as well as the Winklevoss Capital Fund, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The Winklevoss Capital Fund sued Shrem in September, alleging he withheld 5,000 bitcoin he was supposed to purchase on behalf of the Winklevoss brothers. This suit was unsealed in late October.  Shrem has maintained that these accusations are false.
