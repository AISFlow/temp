42399367,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbixhT,1474741840,Winter is Coming: Bitcoin Mining for Heat (And Profit),"For a hobbyist bitcoin miner, the industry is a different place than it was a few years ago.  It used to be that you could use your CPU or GPU to mine bitcoin. But then the price of bitcoin started rising and people began to realize how much money could be earned, and – with the resulting rise in mining difficulty – only those that could afford costly ASICs were in a position to actually make any profit. Soon enough, only the largest operations could compete.  Research shows that, for new miners, the price of a bitcoin needs to be at least $600 to break even if electricity costs are less than $0.10 per kWh.  Another change has been geographic. It used to be that miners were distributed all across the globe, but many of the largest operations have centralized in parts of the world with at least one of the two following variables: cheap/free electricity or a cold environment.  A significant portion of the electricity cost associated with mining has to do with keeping the mining chips cool. For any computer user, we know this as the loud fan working to keep our CPU cool. If the miners are kept cool due to the environment or electricity costs are not a concern, cooling costs become an afterthought.  But what if someone still wanted to mine without those benefits?  Presently, the only company releasing new products targeting the average miner is the Shanghai-based Bitmain. It believes that its recently launched Antminer R4 is the easiest way for the hobbyist miner to generate some cryptocurrency. But do the numbers actually work?  Before the R4 sold out, it would have cost a home miner $1,635 (plus a hefty whack in shipping) to obtain the miner and a power supply unit. With the price of a bitcoin at $594, a pool fee of 1%, and 12 cents per kWh, it would take approximately 537 days to break even on investment.  And that 537 days is contingent on mining difficulty not increasing, so it’s possible that ROI could take far longer, especially if more people take up mining.  Nishant Sharma, international marketing manager at Bitmain, explained that the increased cost per gigahash is due to the custom hardware-design associated with keeping the noise down on the R4. And at 52 decibels – as loud as a conversation at home – it is much quieter than the average bitcoin miner.  “With bitcoin’s current difficulty level, it is extremely challenging to make a low-power or low-cost miner that can breakeven,” Sharma said.  Mining for heat  Unfortunately, that doesn’t actually help the average miner hoping to generate profit – or at least break even as a hobbyist looking to help support the network. But as basically every character in the Game of Thrones would say: Winter is coming.  So to keep warm this winter, why not take what many miners around the world try to get rid of as an unwanted waste product – heat – and use it for something good?  While this isn’t a new idea, per say, there was always a trade off between the loud noise the miner emitted and the heat it produced. Sharma explained that the R4 can act as a fan heater because of its unusual noise level.  The unit of measure for a space heater is the British thermal unit (BTU). For every one watt of electricity that goes into a heater, 3.413 BTUs are released.  The average 900-watt heating fan can be purchased for approximately $50. And at 900W, it’s going to produce 3,071 BTUs, which will help heat about 90 square feet. To power that heater, an individual would be looking at a cost of around $2.59 a day. Let's assume this runs for four months out of the year and electric costs are a little over $310.  All you got for that total investment of $360 is heat.  The R4, which is billed at 845W + 9% at the wall, would require about the same amount in electricity cost every day. The difference is that the owner would earn about $3.04 per day in bitcoin or $394 over the same four-month period.  Is it economical? It would still take a little over 408 days to actually break even on the hardware and that’s if you were running the miner all year. But for those that wanted to give mining a try anyway, it would be somewhat of a cost saver.  In hot water  Another option would be to use the heat from the miner to actually heat up water for use in a shower or to wash your hands.  A 50-gallon, 5,500W electric water heater that runs for three hours every day would cost $722.78 per year in electricity to run, plus the initial cost of approximately $500.  Because the bitcoin miner is kicking off heat, some companies have had the idea of pushing water through mining chips.  One company trying the approach is BitHeat. The firm believed that it could create a bitcoin miner for anywhere between $1,200-$2,2,00 that would produce enough heat every day to heat a 40-gallon tank.  In a blog post from last November, the firm wrote:  “For chips with efficiencies around .16 J/GH a $1200 price point would ROI in about 20 months, and have a 50% ROI in 40 months. But with BitFury's 16nm chip (.06 J/GH) it would ROI in about 6 months at a $1200 price point, and about 18 months at a $3000 price point, and a 50% ROI in 35 months.”  With a life expectancy of 12-years for the average electric water heater, a breakeven of only 18 months would create an additional 10.5 years for someone to heat their water and mine bitcoin on a daily basis.  Spreading Cost  Ultimately, making the decision to mine for heat is simple: you’d be using the electricity anyway. Because the input for a bitcoin miner is electricity, but there is the output of both heat and bitcoin, the possibility of subsidizing the cost of heat is alluring.  The primary problem is the cost of hardware. The BitHeat team said its miners could break even after only a year and a half, but that is when providing hot water – which people need year round.  If the sole purpose of buying a bitcoin miner was to heat a room, a person might not want to run the miner in the warmer months – greatly increasing the time before ROI.  Still, if someone was going to mine anyway, spreading the cost of electricity across mining and keeping warm can be a straightforward attempt at achieving breakeven as quickly as possible.

42399357,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbixaa,1474720853,The Looming War for Blockchain Patents,"There’'s a patent land grab developing in the blockchain space that could potentially make doing business more challenging for those who want to build upon the open-source technology in the future.  “Everyone is trying to stake their claim and plot out their business strategy,” said Ted Mlynar, a partner in the intellectual property practice at Hogan Lovells in New York.  According to Mlynar and his colleague, Ira Schaefer, there are a lot of patents pending related to bitcoin, cryptocurrency, blockchain and distributed ledgers.  Publicly available records show the strong interest in filing patents related to the technology. A search for “blockchain” on the US Patent and Trademark Office website brings up 60 hits, whereas looking up “bitcoin” highlights more than 500 pending patents.  “But it remains to be seen whose claim will be allowed or issued,” Mlynar said.  One problem with the claims  the two Hogan Lovells partners have seen is that the applications themselves are considerably broad. The Alice Corp Pty Ltd vs CLS Bank Int’l court decision – which singled out financial business methods as abstract concepts that are not likely patentable – means that patent examiners will be taking a stern look at the claims.  Plus, any patent filed after the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA), which was signed into law in 2011, will be answerable to a post grant review. This allows anyone to oppose the validity of the claim within the first nine months of its issuing, which the two Hogan Lovells partners think will make keeping a blockchain patent difficult.  “All of these are new tools in any kind of patent litigation war, for those who have patents or those who are fighting for patents,” said Schaefer.  And this process of narrowing down the scope of blockchain patents and the impending patent war will likely take several years, according to Mlynar.  But Geoff Cohen, PhD, vice president of digital forensics at Stroz Friedberg in Boston, isn’t so sure.  “The only reason we haven’t seen it yet for all the talk and hype ... is that [blockchain] hasn’t turned into huge profits for anybody yet,” Cohen said. “On an industrial economic scale you don’t have standing companies making huge steady profits over the course of multiple years.”  Eve of war  That state of affairs might be right around the corner, however. Several startups and large financial institutions have stoked excitement about the prospect of a commercial launch of their respective blockchain products late this year or early next.  As companies both big and small gear up to launch profit-making products, they’re also gearing up to go to patent war.  Patent litigation, at its simplest, generally goes one of two ways, said Cohen. In once instance, a patent-holding small startup might go after a large corporation knowing it’ll get a sizeable payout from the corporation.  Under the other scenario, a large incumbent player might launch a lawsuit against smaller companies in an effort to effectively tax the competition by way of court expenses. Sometimes, these efforts even put those on the receiving end of a patent lawsuit out of business entirely.  “It’s an investment decision for the startups,” Cohen said. “For large corporates, sometimes they sue for strategic reasons.”  There’s already been a hint of the latter in the blockchain space already, although via trademark infringement. Eris Exchange, an over-the-counter futures market is trying to stop Eris Industries, a well-known blockchain software startup, from using the name.  What’s particularly interesting about the case, according to a report by American Banker, is that Eris Exchange’s founder and board member, Don Wilson, is also the co-founder and a board member of Digital Asset Holdings, the competing blockchain startup led by Blythe Masters, a former JPMorgan Chase executive. However, it’s unclear whether there is a direct connection.  Another soon-to-be plaintiff could be Dell Products LP. The company published an application for computing device configuration and management using a secure decentralized transaction ledger. The patent is a continuation of one the company applied for in March 2015. If that patent is issued, the incumbent company could go after smaller startups using the same process.  But bitcoin and blockchain startups are also securing their stake. For example, Coinbase has about 10 patent applications waiting in the wings.  Defensive offense  Cohen has some first-hand experience with these issues. His background lies in computer science, but he spent the past 10 years consulting on high-stake, high-tech litigation for Stroz Friedberg. Specifically, he and his team worked through many smartphone patent cases between 2010 and 2013.  One threat Cohen has seen and is worried might affect the blockchain industry is that large companies, which perceive that they have monopoly of sorts being undermined by small startups trying to offer the same kind of service, will move to stifle any possible competition. In many instances, the larger company will dredge up past patents, sometimes for products that never went to market, in order to wage war against another firm.  “Big companies tend to have big portfolios of thousands of patents that they can generally find something that relates,” Cohen said.  But Schafer and Mlynar aren’t so sure. They haven’t seen any large institutions getting issued handfuls of blockchain-related patents. Although, they agree many companies get patents for defensive measures.  “There are a lot of strategies for patent enforcement, mainly someone has economic interests that they are trying to advance, a business that you are trying to protect, so you can use patents to clear out competition,” Mlynar said. “But the blockchain needs multiple participants so … you risk public censure.”  Plus, patents are typically issued on 20-year timelines and can be used to sue for infringement and damages going back six years with injunction against further or future use.  “That’s why patents are so valuable,” said Schaefer.  Blockchain patent push  Of course, you can’t explore the idea of blockchain patents without touching on Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of bitcoin. History suggests that Nakamoto must be more aligned with the open-source community than patent-hungry corporations, since he/she/they did not apply for a bitcoin patent in 2009.  And, since the invention itself has been used in the public for more than a year, any creator would be barred from patenting it at this point.  That time limit is what is interesting about Craig Wright’s patent assertions after claiming he was Satoshi Nakamoto earlier this year. Cohen assumes that Wright’s patent applications are likely about trying to make some money off his now infamous reputation.  “Once something has become public information there’s not a whole lot you can do to reverse that; that’s not fair to the general commonwealth,” Cohen said. “There’s public interest in saying if you’ve let it out in the public for a year, you’ve missed your window.”  It’s because of this that the industry is unlikely to see any foundational patents actually being issued.  While patent issuance can sometimes take several years, it’s not likely that someone has a foundational patent on bitcoin that hasn’t been realized – one in which anyone that’s operating in bitcoin might then have to pay a tax to the patent holder.  The more plausible scenario, according to Cohen, is that people will obtain patents for specific applications or uses cases for bitcoin or other blockchains. For example, the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) just issued a patent for a method of analyzing transactions on a distributed ledger.  However, it’s also unclear how narrowly or broadly the scope of those patents will be interpreted.  “There will not likely be a patent for all uses of the blockchain or of distributed ledger. Instead they’ll be very specific,” Cohen said.  Beware of trolls  Even more worrisome than the back-and-forth between incumbents and startups could be the patent trolls, or, as Cohen politely put it, the patent assertion entities (PAEs).  PAEs like Intellectual Ventures or Acacia Research Corporation buy up portfolios of patents and keep them on the sidelines until they see an opportunity to make money on either litigation or a licensing campaign.  “I would be surprised if these companies didn’t have some patents in the bitcoin/blockchain field or the money to buy up a company that does have those patents,” Cohen said. “The better funded these [bitcoin/blockchain startup] companies are and the more profit they’re making, the more the patent world is going to start circling around and looking for a target.”  Plus, abstract patents that are applied to new technology, sometimes called 'submarine patents', are going to make these threats hard to see in advance.  Yet for all the gloom and doom, according to Cohen, there are ways to protect the technology. It’s something that will require the community to come together to protect businesses from the threat of licensing fees and patent litigation, he said.  For instance, when a large corporate starts suing smaller companies over patents, those small firms will generally work on their own to fight the lawsuit. However, if all of those businesses came together to hire a law firm to defend them all, they might have a better chance at continuing business and fending off the suit.  “The more coordination and collective action there can be, the more efficient the response is,” Cohen said.
