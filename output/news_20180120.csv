42380288,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Mfkb,1516450802,Lightning Network May Not Solve Bitcoin's Scaling 'Trilemma',"Frances Coppola spent many years working in banks and IT, and now writes and speaks about finance, banking and economics.          Bitcoin has proven incapable of accommodating growing demand without deviating considerably from Satoshi Nakamoto's original vision of a ""peer-to-peer electronic cash system.""  It was intended to provide a fast, secure and inexpensive means of making payments without using the traditional financial system. Today it still only manages a tiny proportion of the traffic of, say, Visa or Mastercard, yet has become cripplingly slow and very expensive.  Solving bitcoin's scaling problem has become a principal concern of developers. But the problem has proved intractable.  Now, making a virtue out of necessity, the buzz is that bitcoin is ""digital gold."" Its built-in limit of 21 million bitcoins makes it an ideal anchor for a hard-money financial system similar to a strict gold standard. A new payment system could be built on top of it.  The problem is, it isn't possible to have full decentralization, a fixed money supply and sufficient liquidity for an efficient payments system. This is bitcoin's ""trilemma.""  Immobile money  In the gold standards of old, there was no trilemma. They were always centralized.  For example, the ""classical"" gold standard of the 19th century was the heyday of the British Empire, which at that time covered a third of the globe. The pound was the currency of international trade, and it was backed by gold.  Countries in the empire were forced on to the gold standard by the British government; countries outside the empire joined the gold standard, or even adopted the pound as their currency, because it made trade much easier.  In the center of the web, the Bank of England managed both the price of gold and pound issuance. It was the most centralized financial system since the Roman Empire.  But for bitcoin, the fact that it is designed as a decentralized system means something else has to give. And the clue is its rapidly rising price.  Bitcoin is becoming illiquid.  Bitcoin's growing illiquidity is due to a toxic combination of high demand, hoarding and designed-in scarcity. The rapid price rise indicates that purchases have increased much more than sales. More and more people are buying bitcoin in the hopes of cashing in as the price rises, while those who already own bitcoins are Holding On for Dear Life for the same reason.  People are also reluctant to spend their bitcoins, because that rapidly rising price means that they face huge opportunity costs.  And although bitcoins are still being mined, the rate at which they are mined is nowhere near enough to meet demand – and anyway, miners too can HODL their bitcoins.  Meanwhile, rising transaction volumes are causing network congestion. Bitcoin has no means of adjusting capacity other than rationing verification. Miners verify transactions with higher fees more quickly than those with lower fees. Those who want fast verification (which is nearly everyone, since bitcoin’s price is rising so fast) will pay higher fees. Those who don't want to pay higher fees must wait longer for their transactions to settle.  Bitcoin’s popularity therefore means both higher transaction fees and slower settlement times. The design feature intended to prevent it coming to a hyperinflationary end is driving it towards deflationary gridlock. As Business Insider asked, what on earth is the point of money that you can't spend and can't convert to anything else?  But is there a way round this problem? The clever folks working on the Lightning Network think so. Their solution is to take most transactions off-chain, and to share liquidity across the network.  Supply shortfall  Lightning is a decentralized network of pre-funded, bilateral bitcoin payment channels off the bitcoin blockchain. Lightning transactions are typically small, and most are not broadcast to the blockchain. So they should be much faster and cheaper than on-chain bitcoin transactions.  Assuming enough people open Lightning payment channels, there will eventually be a sizable bitcoin liquidity pool distributed across the network. The question is, how to enable it to be shared.  Lightning developers are designing a routing facility that identifies which network nodes have sufficient funds to make a payment, calculates the shortest viable route to the payment destination across those nodes, and sends the payment. If this works, it would resolve the bitcoin trilemma.  But it is not certain that it will work. There are two potential problems.  The first is that Lightning's pre-funded channels tie up funds that could be used for other purposes. Because of this, people may choose to keep very low balances in their Lightning channels, topping them up frequently rather than making infrequent balance adjustments.  And the second is that channel funding changes constantly. Typically, people would fund their channel, then pay the balance down gradually. Soon after funding, there could be quite a large balance, but only a few days later, the balance might have diminished considerably.  If a lot of people fund their channels at around the same time – for example, if people fund their channels on payday, then pay them down over the next month – liquidity across the network could vary considerably. This would mean that, at times, particularly for larger payments, it could be difficult or even impossible to find a payment route.  As it stands, therefore, Lightning could prove as illiquid as bitcoin.  Lightning's illiquidity problem could be solved by creating large payment channels kept open and fully funded at all times, so that they were always available for payment routing. But this would mean Lightning was not fully decentralized.  Such ""hub"" channels would be more efficient for payments, but they would be a magnet for thieves and a point of weakness in the network. If one went down, an awful lot of payments could be disrupted.  The alternative would be to allow channels temporarily to go into deficit as a payment passes through. This would ensure that payments always settled.  But since it is effectively fractional reserve lending, it would breach the ""gold standard"" principle of bitcoin. If gold is needed to settle payments, and you haven't got enough gold, you can't settle payments. That's how a gold standard works. It is also why it fails.  Lightning is still a work in progress, of course. But at present, it is hard to see how it can resolve bitcoin's three-pronged problem.

42380284,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MffZ,1516447803,Battle-Testing Lightning: Schools Start Contest to Secure Bitcoin’s Layer 2,"While many see the Lightning Network as the main hope for bitcoin's scaling issues, it's unclear whether many developers are actually working to make that a reality.  According to Lightning Labs CEO Elizabeth Stark, there may be as few as 10 total full-time developers focused on implementations of the technology, something that's kept the network from launching sooner.  Against this backdrop, a group of 26 universities known as the Bsafe.network have launched a contest to entice people to evaluate bitcoin's layer-two technologies, namely Lightning.  Although the prize hasn't been named yet, the contest looks to entice engineers, students and professors to measure the security and privacy of the network and ""collect attack models"" that bad actors could use to disrupt payments going over the Lightning Network, a technology which is heralded as a way to scale bitcoin and potentially reduce fees.  This extra boost in scrutiny comes at a time when users and developers are anxious for Lightning to launch for real.  While Lightning Network developers recommend only using the technology on the testnet with dummy coins, a handful of eager users and developers have begun playing around with the technology with real bitcoin. Some of these intrepid testers have even lost a little money in the process. A few companies, such as VPN provider TorGuard, already accept Lightning Network payments.  The competition is inspired by past successful contests to improve the cryptography standards commonly used across the internet to secure data, such as AES and SHA-3, said Bsafe.network co-founder and Georgetown University research professor Shin'ichiro Matsuo.  And, he continued, Bsafe's global test network maintained by the universities will act as a neutral research body to analyze submissions for battle-testing Lightning Network.  Matsuo told CoinDesk:  ""We think many enhancements of Lightning Network will come through this competition.""  Submissions for the contest, which is open to anyone, are due in March. Once all the proposals are in, the universities will test all of them on Bsafe's global test network, culminating in a conference in August where winners will be announced.  Figuring it out  Matsuo said he also hopes the submissions will shine a light on the security and privacy of the technology and how it will interact with the cryptocurrency's ""layer one.""  Because no one can really know how the technology will be used or exploited at scale, this contest could help. By asking for proposals from all over the world, which will be analyzed by academics from a number of different countries and fields, Matsuo believes the competitive atmosphere will help to shed light on what the precise trade-offs are.  ""Layer-two technologies such as the Lightning Network are needed to enhance the scalability of payments over the bitcoin blockchain, but they might change the trust model, meaning Lightning Network might not be wholly decentralized,"" he told CoinDesk.  Because of this, the technology has its fair share of critics, the strongest of whom contend it won't be decentralized in practice.  The contest, then, is an effort to glean insights about the Lightning Network's strengths and weaknesses.  Open competition  And after the submissions are judged and awarded, the Bsafe.network plans to ""disclose all of the evaluations"" and open-source all the code so the bitcoin community can pick through it and learn from the results.  But beyond improving the Lightning Network, Matsuo hopes Bsafe.network will have another broader impact on the bitcoin and blockchain industry.  Matsuo wants this contest to be only the first of many and wants to grow the network of universities that are part of the group, in an effort to make its reach even more diverse.  ""With 26 universities and growing, doing this type of open competition gives us a neutral result to compare that kind of technology,"" he said.  And if the group can convince the wider community of its neutrality, Matsuo hopes those engaged in fiery arguments – such as the block-size debate – in the community can turn to Bsafe for guidance based on tests. In his mind, the vitriol that many times comes from the debates is exacerbated by ""communication issues"" that a Bsafe.network could steer more productively by providing technical analysis.  He concluded:  ""We already have this for cryptography, but for bitcoin and blockchain, we need a more neutral way of analyzing the technology.""
