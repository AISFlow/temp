42430355,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMriTh,1553899845,Canadian Municipality Set to Accept Bitcoin for Property Tax Payments,"A municipality in Canada is set to accept bitcoin for property tax payments starting next month as part of a one-year trial.  The Town of Innisfil, Ontario, announced Thursday that the cryptocurrency payment option will be offered in partnership with Toronto-based digital assets trading platform Coinberry.  Starting April, approximately 36,000 residents of the town will now see bitcoin (BTC) as a payment option on the municipality’s website. Other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin cash (BCH), ether (ETH), litecoin (LTC) and XRP could also be added in the future, according to the statement.  Using Coinberry’s cryptocurrency payment processing solution Coinberry Pay, residents will be able to pay taxes in bitcoin in Innisfil’s digital wallet.  Coinberry will then process those funds “in accordance with strict adherence to existing financial regulatory requirements” and “instantly” convert them into Canadian dollars and transfer it to the municipality. Coinberry is a Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC)-registered firm.  Innisfil mayor Lynn Dollin said:  “There’s no doubt that cryptocurrency is growing in usage and popularity. By getting into this now, we are making sure our municipality is ahead of the game, and signalling to the world that we truly are a future-ready and innovative community.”  Back in November, the U.S. state of Ohio also allowed businesses to pay taxes in bitcoin, in partnership blockchain payments processor BitPay. Ohio is also expected to extend the service to individuals in the future.

42430343,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMri7h,1553894114,Justin Sun Draws Heat From Tron Fans for Waffling on Promised Prizes,"Tron founder Justin Sun stirred up controversy this week by promising to give away a Tesla to one lucky Twitter follower who retweeted his post. Now, according to a statement issued Friday, he’s giving away two.  A video of the random selection identified a Washington, D.C.-based account, @uzgaroth, as the initial winner. However, Sun promptly followed up with tweets claiming there was a glitch in the selection process.  Sun would try again with a live video to select a new winner, following a process previously tested with a giveaway in China on the social network Weibo. Instead of the Tesla, Sun offered the thwarted contestant a free ticket to the next Tron conference in 2020.  After a few hours of backlash on social media, Sun issued the following statement on Medium:  “I’ve happily decided to give away two Teslas to further my mission of creating transparency, reliability and openness about blockchain.”  We’ve reached out to both contestants, including the second winner in Vietnam, a user called @LeoHuynhPro, and will update if we hear back. The original tweet on March 12 promised this car giveaway was only the beginning, adding that Sun also planned to give away $20 million in a “free cash airdrop.”  In response to the Tesla controversy, Tron spokesperson Cliff Edwards told CoinDesk that Sun is “giving away money to fans to try to grow interest in the industry,” adding:  “This is a Justin initiative, not Tron or BitTorrent. This is Justin personally offering his Twitter fans a chance to win a car.”  This contradicts earlier statements Edwards gave CoinDesk in January regarding a job posting for a personal assistant for Sun. ""Since Tron is self-funded by Justin, the two are essentially one and the same,” Edwards said at the time.  For this giveaway, Edwards told CoinDesk Friday, the money came from Sun’s personal wealth from previous ventures, not the $70 million raised during the Tron token sale in 2017 or the $7.2 million raised in the BitTorrent token sale earlier this year.  Regardless of the source of funds, this isn’t the first time Sun or the Tron Foundation have been accused of failing to keep their promises to competition winners.  Hackathon mixup  In December 2018, the Tron Foundation sponsored a Tron Accelerator hackathon where the top 56 teams were promised cash rewards totaling $1 million.  But Edwards said there ended up being so many high-quality submissions that Sun decided to give “less money” to “more winners.”  “Prizes and giveaways are always fraught with people complaining that they’re not getting the money, versus when other people are getting the money,” Edwards told CoinDesk. “Justin explained to everyone quite clearly why he did it and in fact increased the jackpot.”  One member of one of the winning teams, who asked to stay anonymous to avoid association with a company they no longer consider reputable, told CoinDesk they received only half of the funds promised. The member described this remote hackathon as a ""shit show"" that didn't meet professional norms. Alleged prize reductions and other disappointments sparked incredulous speculation across Reddit and Discord communities. Some developers claimed their submissions weren’t considered at all.  The winning developer told CoinDesk:  “I actually think it [the Tron Foundation] is much more cash-strapped than they will care to admit. We were given this [the reduced, $10,000 prize] in Tether.”  An official Tron Foundation blog post in January 2019 announcing the winners – which doesn’t mention Sun nor an increased jackpot – stated that 113 projects were selected in the end to share the original $1 million in prizes. In Sun’s defense, Edwards said the mogul is striving to be both transparent and generous in a way that still promotes broader outreach.  Speaking to how, as with the Tesla giveaway, the hackathon also distributed Justin’s personal funds at his prerogative, Edwards said:  “This is Justin setting the rules for these things. This is Justin’s money, not Tron or BitTorrent.”  Justin Sun image by Brady Dale for CoinDesk",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | SPONSORED | USDT | BTT | TOKEN SALE,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/03/29/justin-sun-draws-heat-from-tron-fans-for-waffling-on-promised-prizes,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/556ff8c60684b06cef61d503074efb3a0ed7781b-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Chairing Bakkt's board will be Tom Noonan, described as ""a cyber expert"" and the founder of Internet Security Systems (which IBM acquired in 2006), JouleX (which Cisco acquired in 2013) and Endgame. He will be accompanied by Akshay Naheta, managing partner at Softbank; Sean Collins, managing partner at Goldfinch Partners; ICE CEO and chairman Jeff Sprecher; and Kelly Loeffler, Bakkt's head.  Noonan is already a member of ICE's own board of directors.  Once approved by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), Bakkt's physically settled bitcoin futures contracts will be listed on ICE Futures US and ICE Clear US, ""where global market participants already transact,"" Loeffler wrote in a blog post Friday. ""The price discovery function in these new physical delivery markets should contribute to building confidence in bitcoin prices.""  She described Bakkt's pending products as ""the first physical delivery price discovery contracts for bitcoin to the U.S., where price formation will occur in federally regulated, transparent markets.""  Moreover, she added:  ""Similarly, just as digital asset custody is at the core of Bakkt’s infrastructure development, secure custody is at the heart of our physical delivery bitcoin futures contracts.""  However, Loeffler's update did not contain any specific about when it may go live, saying only that, ""We’ll share more about our custody platform shortly, as we work to set a new standard in digital asset security.""  The platform – whose launch has already been delayed twice – does not have a firm date yet on when it may go live. The company is waiting on the CFTC to approve its plan to custody bitcoin on behalf of its clients. In Friday's post, Loeffler said Bakkt has ""worked closely"" with the CFTC in recent months.  Typically, regulations require that customer funds are actually held by banks, trust companies or futures commission merchants. While CFTC staff have been reviewing Bakkt's proposal since last year, it is unclear where the process stands.  The CFTC is expected to publish Bakkt's proposal for a 30-day public review period, after which the commissioners will vote to approve or disapprove. As such, Bakkt is unlikely to launch before May.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has delayed making a decision on two bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) proposals earlier this year.  The first ETF proposal, filed by Bitwise Asset Management with NYSE Arca, was published in the Federal Register on Feb. 15, kicking off the first 45-day clock for an initial decision on the filing. Overall, the SEC has 240 days to approve or reject any ETF proposal. Today's decision means the SEC now has another 45 to consider the proposal.  As a result, the SEC said Friday it will ""either approve or disapprove, or institute proceedings to determine whether to disapprove, the proposed rule change"" by May 16, 2019.  According to today's letter, the SEC has so far received 21 comments on the proposed rule change.  The SEC is also reviewing another bitcoin ETF proposal filed by VanEck and SolidX, in partnership with Cboe BZX Exchange. The VanEck/SolidX proposal was initially filed nearly a year ago, but was withdrawn in January during the longest partial government shutdown in U.S. history. VanEck CEO Jan van Eck explained that the shutdown had – at least temporarily – paused conversations between the SEC and the companies which submitted the proposal.  Cboe resubmitted the proposal in late January, and was published in the Federal Register on Feb. 20. On Friday, the SEC extended this decision as well, designating May 21 as the date on which it would either make a firm decision or launch proceedings to do so.  While the SEC has not yet approved any bitcoin ETFs, prominent voices in the community believe it may happen this year.  In an interview with Roll Call published in early February, SEC Commissioner Robert Jackson said he believes an ETF proposal will “satisfy the standards” the regulator has set, “eventually.”  Attorney Jake Chervinsky of the Kobre Kim law firm went even further, previously telling CoinDesk that in his opinion, ""it's entirely possible that another [10] months of development in the cryptocurrency ecosystem could be enough to finally warrant approval of a bitcoin ETF.”  SEC image via Shutterstock",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/03/29/sec-postpones-decision-on-bitwise-vaneck-bitcoin-etf-proposals,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d1fa36aa37caed4cda9344c2d32d9eda1127bd30-1500x861.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42402722,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdcbwe,1553883695,Fidelity Poaches Coinbase Institutional Sales Head Christine Sandler,"Coinbase's director of institutional sales, Christine Sandler, has left the cryptocurrency startup for Fidelity Investments, one of the world's largest financial services providers, according to multiple industry sources.  Sandler, a long-time executive in the financial space, held positions with NYSE Euronext and Barclays Investment Bank before joining Coinbase in March 2018 to head up its institutional sales division.  It is not clear which part of Fidelity she is joining, but a logical candidate would be the recently launched Fidelity Digital Assets (FDAS), a cryptocurrency custody and brokerage service for institutional investors.  According to one source, her departure stemmed from a change in the direction of Coinbase's institutional business.  “It has become clear that Coinbase is focusing on crypto first and crypto-native hedge funds, and the team that Adam [White, a former Coinbase executive] brought on board was very much focused on the institutional world,"" this person said, adding:  ""Christine is part of that; she had decades of experience of working with traditional financial institutions. Her skills are much better suited to a company that is taking that approach – like Fidelity.”  Indeed, White left Coinbase in October. to become chief operating officer of Bakkt, the bitcoin futures platform being built by Intercontinental Exchange, the parent of the New York Stock Exchange. Similarly, another of his hires at Coinbase, former head of trading Hunter Merghart, resigned in October.  Coinbase confirmed Sandler's departure but declined to comment further. Fidelity declined to comment. Attempts to reach Sandler by press time were unsuccessful.  Onboarding institutions  Fidelity, which first announced it was building a crypto trading and storage platform last October, launched earlier this year and has begun onboarding clients. The firm currently offers bitcoin services, though it may look to add other cryptocurrencies in the coming months.  Tom Jessop  , Fidelity Digital Assets' president, previously told CoinDesk that the firm had developed an in-house framework to evaluate different cryptocurrencies, and it would most likely examine potential listings by looking at coins' market caps.  That being said, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, ether, will probably not be added anytime soon, Jessop has said, citing concerns about its upgrade process.  While FDAS has already on-boarded a select number of clients, Sandler's joining may indicate a renewed push to draw in major customers.  Jessop told CoinDesk earlier this month that one of the firm's goals for 2019 was to add new clients, in particular receiving ""consistent interest from institutions.""  In terms of the volume that these institutions represent, he explained, ""I know in terms of [assets under management] … it’s anywhere from like low single-digit millions up to tens if not hundreds of millions.""

The employment site released its latest figures for job postings relating to blockchain, cryptocurrency and bitcoin in the U.S. on Thursday, with the data covering the period from February 2018 to February 2019.  Topping the table was Deloitte, with IBM and KPMG in second and third place, respectively. EY and Accenture (another major consulting firm) came fourth and fifth, also respectively.  Deloitte's top placing is perhaps not surprising, as the firm has been very active in the blockchain space, participating in trials, developing products and offering services around the tech.  The consulting giant has previously said: “We envision that [Deloitte's] ever-evolving and nimble team will build upon our past success in helping our clients, which includes 92 percent of the financial service companies listed on the Fortune 500 list, to hone their blockchain-backed offerings,” he said.  Indeed.com's data also shows that of all the financial firms, JPMorgan has placed the most ads for blockchain staff over the last year.  While its chairman and president, Jamie Dimon, is notoriously skeptical of bitcoin, his company is actively preparing for a future where blockchain is a key part of financial infrastructure and notably revealed its own in-house cryptocurrency in February.  No other Wall Street institutions made Indeed's top 10.  Discussing the data, Indeed.com economist Andrew Flowers told Forbes that it's ""notable that there’s a lack of financial and banking companies hiring for something that’s made to replace money.”  Microsoft and ethereum development studio ConsenSys also made it to the top 10, according to Indeed's data, in eighth and tenth place, respectively.  Flowers further said the last year marks the first time there have been more job postings than searches – likely because of the decline in crypto prices, as Indeed has previously suggested. The data shows that searches per million on its site for roles involving blockchain, cryptocurrency and bitcoin declined by 67 percent during the period, while the share of job postings per million increased by 90 percent.  Back in November, another Indeed.com data report showed that the number of blockchain job postings increased by 25.49 percent from October 2017 to October 2018.  San Jose, San Francisco and New York are the cities with the most blockchain postings, Indeed's latest report concludes.

The alliance announced the news Thursday, saying that its ""universal euro"" (UPEUR) token is aimed at users looking for a low volatility cryptocurrency. The stablecoin can also potentially offer holders an annual rate of return of 8 percent, the group said.  “In countries with high inflation or limited access to traditional banking, users can now lend their Euro-pegged assets and earn interest,” the companies said.  Aside from Cred, the alliance comprises of the Bittrex crypto exchange, blockchain-based web browser Brave, cryptocurrency finance startup Uphold, student organization Blockchain at Berkeley and blockchain auditing platform CertiK. Together, the group says it sets out to build ""unique digital currency products designed to appeal to mainstream users on a massive scale.""  The alliance has previously released other similar products such as a U.S. dollar stablecoin (UPUSD) and a bitcoin-pegged token (UPBTC).  The UPEUR stablecoin will be available directly through the Uphold platform, the alliance said, adding that it can be used to earn interest via crypto loans firm Cred’s CredEarn program, which pays back interest for loans of digital assets.  To earn interest, users ""in eligible jurisdictions"" will be able to stake the stablecoin through the CredEarn application on Uphold. UPEUR holdings can also be custodied with cryptocurrency storage service providers such as Ledger and BitGo.  Dan Schatt, co-founder of both the alliance and Cred, commented:  “The Universal Euro offers access to a high rate of return and the same commitment to code quality, investor safeguards and transparency. UPEUR is architected with institutional-level security in mind and designed to allow for quick, low-cost conversion of UPEUR to fiat currencies, UPUSD, UPBTC or other digital assets.""  In a similar development earlier this week, TrustToken, developer of dollar-pegged stablecoin TrueUSD, also announced that the token's holders can now leverage their funds to earn “up to 8 percent” in annualized returns. TrustToken also partnered with Cred for the effort, while Uphold, BitGo, Bittrex and Ledger joined as custody providers.

42402724,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdcbxd,1553862626,Former Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles to Appeal Conviction,"Mark Karpeles, former CEO of the long-defunct bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, is to appeal his conviction on data manipulation charges earlier this month.  According to a report from The Associated Press on Friday, Karpeles said he had decided to appeal because the Tokyo District Court did not fully look at the defense arguments.  Karpeles said:  “During the opening of my trial in 2017, I swore to God that I am innocent of all charges. I believe appealing to the judgment is appropriate so that I can be judged again in full consideration of all the facts.”  A different report from The Mainichi on the Karpeles case, today cited anonymous sources as saying that Japanese prosecutors have decided not to appeal the court’s acquittal of Karpeles on charges of embezzlement. The prosecutors had been seeking a 10-year jail term on the charges.  On March 15, the Tokyo District Court found Karpeles guilty of wrongfully making electronic records connected to Mt. Gox’s books, but innocent on charges of embezzlement and breach of trust. He had first been charged by the prosecutors last December, alleging he used about $3 million of customers’ funds for his own personal use.  In early 2014, Mt. Gox revealed it had previously suffered a massive hack involving 850,000 bitcoin, some of which was later found. The exchange officially filed for liquidation in April of that year.  Nobuyasu Ogata, Karpeles’ lawyer in the case, told AP that he welcomed the court’s acquittal of Karpeles on some charges as “a proper decision.” He further argued that his client was “actually a victim” and had been trying to minimize damage at the exchange after the breach, so, as such, Karpeles' actions shouldn't be considered ""illegitimate.""  Karpeles has reiterated his innocence and apologized several times since the collapse of Mt. Gox. He once said, “I never imagined things would end this way and I am forever sorry for everything that’s taken place and all the effect it had on everyone involved.”  Last August, the Japanese bankruptcy court that initially oversaw the case sided with creditors who made a petition to move the case to civic rehabilitation. As such, creditors could file claims for their original bitcoin from Mt.Gox, rather than having them converted to fiat currencies and be paid out at the 2014 bitcoin valuation.  Earlier this month, the exchange’s rehabilitation trustee, Nobuaki Kobayashi, announced that he had made final decisions on whether or not to approve creditor claims. A draft plan for distribution of the exchange's remaining funds is expected by April 26.

42402741,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdccAQ,1553858122,Bitcoin Price Hits 5-Week High With Chart Echoing 2015 Pre-Rally Pattern,"View  Bitcoin jumped to a five-week high of $4,100 earlier today, reinforcing the bullish view put forward by the recent bounce from the crucial 30-day moving average support. That, coupled with the flag breakout on the 4-hour chart, indicates scope for a re-test of $4,190 (February high).  The short-term bullish case would weaken if prices fail to close today above $4,055 (March 21 high).  On the downside, a bearish reversal would be confirmed if and when prices find acceptance below the 30-day moving average, currently at $3,900.  Additionally, bitcoin's 200-candle moving average (MA) on the three-day chart – a lagging indicator – is flatlined for the first time since early 2015. If history is any guide, then BTC could oscillate in the recent trading range of $3,100–$4,300 in the next few months before breaking into a bull market once the 200-candle MA begins trending south.  Bitcoin is slowly gaining altitude with a long-term lagging indicator flashing signs similar to those seen before the 2015 bull breakout.  The crypto market leader rose to $4,100 at 10:30 UTC on Bitstamp today – the highest level since Feb. 24 – validating a bullish higher low established along the crucial 30-day moving average (MA) support earlier this week.  Prices, therefore, could rise further toward the February high of $4,190 in the next few days. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $4,075, representing 0.5 percent gain on a 24-hour basis.  While BTC's short-term prospects seem to have improved with the move, a longer term bullish reversal above $4,236 still remains elusive.  A convincing break above that level, however, could happen in the next few months, according to historical data related to bitcoin's three-day chart 200-candle moving average (MA). That average is based on two-year-old data and tends to lag price by more than a year.  For instance, bitcoin's price topped out at $20,000 in December 2017 and has been charting lower highs ever since. The 200-candle MA, however, continued to trend north indicating a bullish setup throughout 2018 and shed the bullish bias (turned flat) this month – three months after price sell-off ran out of steam near $3,100.  A similar action was seen in months leading up to the long-term bullish reversal of October 2015, as seen in the chart below.  3-day chart  As seen above right, the 200-candle MA continued sloping upwards through the December 2013 to January 2015 bear market and turned flat in March/April 2015 – three months after the end of the sell-off at $152.  The cryptocurrency traded largely in the range of $200-$300 in the next six months before breaking into a bull run in October 2015.  It is worth noting that the average had begun trending south three months before the bull breakout.  If history is any guide, then BTC may spend the next few months in the recent trading range of $3,100–$4,300 and could pick up a strong bid once the key average starts trending lower.  Daily and 4-hour charts  Bitcoin's break above the March 21 high of $4,055 is accompanied by a bull flag breakout, a bullish continuation pattern, on the 4-hour chart (above right). Further, the 14-day relative strength index is reporting bullish conditions with an above 50.00 reading (see daily chart, left).  As a result, the February high of $4,190 could soon come into play. A longer-term bullish reversal would be confirmed if prices close above that level on Sunday.  The short-term bullish case, however, would weaken if prices fail to close above $4,055 today.

The new blockchain-related positions, all of which are based at the company’s Menlo Park HQ in California, include: production manager, business operations manager, data scientist, software engineer and growth product manager.  CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been talking a lot in public about blockchain and cryptography of late. His comments suggested a move to embrace end-to-end encryption of users’ data on Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. However, some critics are calling his decentralization and privacy mantra nothing more than a PR message.  In a video interview with Harvard Law professor Jonathan Zittrain, Zuckerberg speculated on the prospect of Facebook using a blockchain model to enable decentralized logins without its servers acting as authenticators.  Meanwhile, the New York Times recently reported that Facebook is developing a digital currency that its users can trade among each other and exchange on cryptocurrency exchanges.  Whatever Facebook is up to, it’s definitely hiring.  The latest ads also provide some insight into Facebook’s crypto strategy. The company said the blockchain team “is a startup within Facebook and we're exploring lots of areas of interest across all facets of blockchain technology.”  It's also talking up the silver-lined promises of blockchain, saying:  “Our ultimate goal is to help billions of people with access to things they don't have now - that could be things like healthcare, equitable financial services, or new ways to save or share information.”  Facebook image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/03/29/facebooks-blockchain-hiring-spree-continues-with-5-new-job-postings,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/baaed630d102860c0ca52c6f094b531d1adfb619-1500x928.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42402732,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdcc5V,1553851856,Bitmain's Jihan Wu: ASICs Are Making Ethereum More Decentralized,"Jihan Wu, co-founder and former co-CEO of crypto mining giant Bitmain, is arguing that ASIC miners make blockchain networks more decentralized – a position that counters the prevailing opinion of developers who see specialized miners as a force that excludes broad participation in the competition for mining rewards.  Speaking at a keynote during a blockchain event hosted by a crypto media outlet Mars Finance in Chongqing, China, on Wednesday, Wu told attendees he believes ASIC miners – powerful processors designed for crunching specific algorithms – are less of a centralizing force than more general purpose graphics processing units (GPUs) that are also commonly used as an alternative for cryptocurrency mining.  The discussion also led Wu to cast doubts on ethereum's coming ProgPow upgrade (for Programmatic Proof-of-Work), which, by altering the network's mining algorithm, is designed to block ASIC machines and improve the computing advantage of GPUs.  He told the audience:  ""While we have seen various network upgrades that aim to become ASIC-resistant, such as Cuckoo cycle and ProgPow, but what we can foresee is that, very likely, there will still be ASIC miners for these two algorithms.""  Recently, the ethereum community voted to approve the network's ProgPow upgrade. However, the timeline for activation is not confirmed yet, as a period is needed for auditing the code. It's a change that, if activated, could have an impact on ethereum's mining rewards – a market that's estimated to be worth over $600 million a year.  Wu added that the ethereum network is already centralized to some extent, pointing to statistics that two major ethereum mining pools – Sparkpool and Ethermine – control over half of the network's computing power.  He further cited rumors, without providing any evidence, that certain individuals involved in the ProgPow proposal directly report to the CEO of NVIDIA, a major maker of GPU hardware with a dominant market share.  Wu alleged:  ""To me, ProgPow is clearly an effort to achieve centralization, in an attempt to exclude other integrated circuit designers to participate in ethereum mining. And GPU hardware is strongly protected by patents, so having a tailor-made algorithm for this type of hardware is certainly a way to avoid a fully competitive market.""  Switching from the proof-of-work algorithm, as used by ethereum currently, to proof-of-stake (supporting a network by holding a stake of its native tokens) will not solve the problem of centralization for ethereum either, Wu contended. If ethereum completely shifts to proof-of-stake, ""the entire network will be even more centralized – almost undoubtedly,"" he argued.  Yet, Wu's comments on ethereum mining may not be entirely surprising given that his firm, which claims to own about 70 percent of the global crypto mining equipment market share, launched an ethereum ASIC miner in April of last year.  Bitmain once also secured a patent for its ASIC miner equipment design and subsequently sued one of its rivals for IP infringement. The case was dismissed by a local court in China, however, and Bitmain's patent was revoked as a result.  Elsewhere in his speech, Wu also argued that ASIC miners are more capable of securing a blockchain network than GPU hardware. Because each ASIC is specialized for a certain crypto network, they bring a high cost for bad actors wanting to launch a 51 percent attack on a network.  He concluded:  ""But GPU-based mining algorithms are not specialized, they are compatible with each other. If miners attack one cryptocurrency, there are still others that can be mined. That's why there're more 51 percent attacks on GPU-based cryptos.""  Correction (May 15, 2020, 18:51 UTC): ProgPoW stands for programmatic proof-of-work, not progressive proof-of-work, as was previously listed in this article.

42402736,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdcc6U,1553846683,Coinbase Leads Wall Street to Brave New World of Crypto Staking,"The Takeaway:  Coinbase Custody is offering staking services to institutional clients, starting with Tezos.  Client assets will remain inside Coinbase's fully insured cold storage at all times, mitigating risk to investors.  Since staking requires some funds to be kept online, Coinbase will put up its own coins, assuming the risk.  After deducting Coinbase's fee, clients can expect to earn about 6.6 percent annually, the firm says.      Coinbase's custody arm is trying to entice its institutional customers into the brave new world of staking crypto assets for profit.  Starting with the Tezos proof-of-stake (PoS) network, San Francisco-based Coinbase is offering clients the opportunity to make a return on their XTZ, that blockchain’s native token, the company announced Friday. After deducting Coinbase's fee, investors can expect an annual return of around 6.6 percent, the firm estimated.  While that may sound alluring in a world where 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds yield less than half as much (and once-skyrocketing crypto prices are flatlining), investors will have to get comfortable with a highly complex arrangement. But staking is poised to become a bigger opportunity down the line, given that the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, ethereum, is expected to migrate to a PoS consensus system eventually.  Stepping back, unlike bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism – which relies on excessive computation by miners – proof of stake requires participants to have skin in the game by depositing assets to the network and then helping validate decisions about which transactions and blocks should be added. For doing this, they receive payouts much like traditional miners in a PoW system. Users can also be punished by having their stake slashed for not helping or actively hindering consensus.  Moreover, participants who have assets to stake but don't want to take part in the rather involved process of validating transactions and blocks can instead delegate their assets to someone else. Participants who choose to stake their crypto assets earn passive income on it, which ranges from around 5 percent to 25 percent annually, depending on the network and the level of participation.  The rub for investors is that generally speaking, validators running proof-of-stake nodes (known as “bakers” on Tezos) must have some funds online and so effectively ""hot,"" in crypto security parlance. That means these funds are more vulnerable to theft than when the private keys controlling them are kept offline, in so-called cold storage.  To win over institutional investors who might be unsure of the risk/reward profile of PoS, Coinbase Custody is guaranteeing to its customers that all staked coins will stay in fully-insured cold storage. To do this, the company will post the necessary bond to bakers out of its own pocket. In this way, there is “zero risk” to its custody clients, Coinbase claims.  Sam McInvale, head of product at Coinbase Custody, told CoinDesk,  “One of the reasons we are starting with Tezos and then following on with other delegated PoS networks is specifically because we can keep our clients' funds that we will be staking in cold storage at all times.”  In the case of Tezos, bakers must post a bond equal to 10 percent of the total being staked, said McInvale. So if clients deposit $100 million worth of XTZ to coincide with the launch of the service, Coinbase would post a bond of $10 million worth of the tokens to its baker to meet that, he said.  “The way we are doing that is Coinbase Custody would go and buy $10 million worth of Tezos and post that bond so it's our funds that are at risk, never our clients'. So we could suffer a loss if we were to get hacked, but our clients' funds will always be safe,” said McInvale.  Custody clients with XTZ holdings will be automatically delegated from cold storage to the Coinbase baker. The firm does not currently have plans to allow its custody clients to delegate to other (external) bakers.  In the coming weeks, Coinbase will be adding governance support for the Maker (MKR) protocol which created the Dai stablecoin, currently being integrated into over 200 projects. Coinbase said it will also add Tezos voting in Q2 and hopes to add other reputable PoS chains, mentioning Cosmos, Polkadot and potentially Algorand later this year.  To be clear, though: The staking service Coinbase Custody is providing with XZT, and other blockchains down the line, is separate from tokens under consideration for listing on the company's exchanges (though Tezos is also under consideration in this respect.)  It also should be noted that the newer PoS networks, including Tezos, have multiple keys, so the keys used to spend or withdraw assets are not the same as staking keys, which delegate funds. (Think of when a hotel puts a hold on your account as a deposit on a room; the cash is locked but has not left your account). So, the risks associated with staking are more to do with losing out on rewards or being shut out of staking cycles if the keys are stolen.  While he would not recommend any particular approaches to the custody of staking assets, Tezos founder Arthur Breitman told CoinDesk:  “Newer cryptocurrencies and smart-contract platforms, such as Tezos, decentralize by incentivizing the active participation of coin holders. To their credit, custody solutions are adapting quickly to satisfy their customer's desire to take an active role in those networks while keeping their assets safe.”  Coinbase's cut  Coinbase is, of course, happy about helping to grow these decentralized networks, but the firm is also taking a slice for all that hand-holding.  The way McInvale frames it, many institutional players who have sat on the sidelines as far as staking is concerned, now feel confident to tap into an 8 percent annual reward with Tezos.  In this case, Coinbase will be taking between 20 percent and 25 percent of today’s 8 percent Tezos yield, said McInvale. “So the client would actually be earning like 6.6 percent and we would be earning the rest.”  Coinbase said it has already signed several deals with institutional customers and believes this current approach will be scalable for now.  McInvale added,  “We understand the current state of demand and we have got a good line of sight on how to scale this for probably the next six months. Then if things really start to take off because more chains are launching PoS etc, we have some other ideas for how we can manage this in the future.”  And as these networks come online, interest is growing with a number of so-called staking-as-a-service providers appearing, such as Figment, Cryptium and Battlestar Capital, as well as new and sophisticated custody providers like Anchorage and Copper, who are also gearing up for PoS.  Earlier this week  Battlestar Capital, announcing a partnership with cryptocurrency lending startup Celsius Network, said customers of its staking services earn a return of “up to 30 percent” annually on their idle cryptocurrency holdings.  Beyond speculation  There are a couple of important distinctions to be made here. Battlestar is operating non-segregated accounts (Coinbase accounts will be segregated because it makes clients and regulators more comfortable.) Rather it operates staking pools where participants benefit from scale.  As such, staking-as-a-service firms chase the maximum yield on PoS networks by self-bonding. In the case of Tezos, a self-bonding strategy involves dynamically changing bond amounts according to the way bakers perform on the network, explained Jason Stone, founder of Battlestar Capital.  The Coinbase model might be okay for the “set-it-and-forget types,"" he said, but Tezos assets held in non-segregated accounts can net 12.5 percent to 14 percent a year, Stone claimed.  “If you deposit your Tezos with a group running a self-bonding strategy, you earn the amalgamated yield of bonding plus delegating, as opposed to allowing the service provider you chose to receive the greater yield from posting bond themselves, leaving you with only the rewards (less a fee) from traditional baking, i.e., choosing a provider to delegate to,“ he said.  Coinbase pointed out it is not in competition with the likes of Battlestar. “We are not going to be a public staking-as-a-service offering; it's not like just anyone is going to be able to delegate to a Coinbase custody validator and share block rewards,” said McInvale.  Looking ahead, McInvale expects to see interesting arbitrage opportunities, such as between trading and staking, particularly when ethereum switches to PoS. He also said lending assets versus staking them will make interesting business models.  Coinbase said institutions it has talked to were certainly optimistic about staking networks, particularly given the dismal appreciation in asset prices of late. A frisson of excitement is detectable too, McInvale said, concluding,  “There’s also a shift away from only engaging in crypto assets via speculation – so buying and holding – to actually wanting to help secure the blockchain, to wanting to vote and have a voice and help these things evolve.”  Pic: Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong at Consensus 2016.",POSITIVE,XTZ,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | XTZ,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/03/29/coinbase-leads-wall-street-to-brave-new-world-of-crypto-staking,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e0190e8d2628bd29f31fc5ee8fd79ae2123d1958-1320x641.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42402718,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdcbsi,1553828809,Craig Wright's nChain Is Hiring a Lawyer to Protect Its Crypto Patents,"nChain, the company founded by self-proclaimed bitcoin inventor Craig S. Wright, is looking to hire a patent counsel in London to manage and grow the firm's portfolio of blockchain-related IP.  The applicant must be a qualified European Patent Attorney, have a keen interest in bitcoin and blockchain and also possess a first degree in computer science, electronics, physics, or mathematics, the job advertisement stateshttps://nchain.com/en/careers/job/patent-counsel/.  It goes on to say that the London-based position would conduct ""patent drafting"" and ""global prosecution"" for its patents and that the individual would have and “significant responsibility for creating and exploiting commercially valuable IP assets.”  Wright, who is best known for declaring himself (without evidence) to be bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto, is also a strenuous collector of patents related to the technology.  A Reuters report  two years ago first connected Wright with a company called EITC Holdings Ltd (which later became nChain), and through which he had filed over 50 patent applications in the U.K. related to blockchain technology. Earlier this month Jimmy Nguyen, chairman of nChain's strategic advisory board, announced that the firm had filed 666 patent applications.  Data provided by the UK Intellectual Property Office shows that EITC has submitted a range of patent applications focused on the technology in recent years, including ones for “implementing logic gate functionality using a blockchain,"" an “operating system for blockchain IOT devices” and “methods and systems for the efficient transfer of entities on a peer-to-peer distributed ledger.""  The explosion of R&D related to blockchain potentially creates an environment where “Non-Practising Entities (NPEs),” sometimes referred to as ""patent trolls,"" can thrive simply by seeking and enforcing patent rights.  Patent disputes have been described as the sport of kings: expensive and to be avoided. A good example of this was last decade’s smartphone patent wars.  To date, there have been no reports of nChain or Craig Wright becoming involved in patent disputes.  Marc Kaufman, a partner at law firm Rimon, told Coindesk: “nChain has made it clear that they are aggressively pursuing patent protection for their developments. They have also made it clear that they intend to leverage their patents to support the Bitcoin Cash blockchain and more recently the Bitcoin SV fork from Bitcoin Cash.”  Kaufman said it was not surprising that nChain is looking to hire an internal patent attorney as, “by their own assertions, patents seem to be the largest part of their revenue model. In fact, the job description states that they want to put [the patent portfolio] to use in support of nChain’s commercial objectives.”  nChain did not respond to requests for comment by press time.
