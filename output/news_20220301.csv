13220804,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=484887,1646179162,Bitcoin Sets Record For Largest Single Day Pump After One Year,"Bitcoin recorded its largest single-day pump in a year as the Russian ruble tanked 20% in its value against the dollar amidst worldwide economic sanctions imposed in the country after their attack on Ukraine. Sanctions Pump Bitcoin The most influential countries in the world have imposed penalties on Russia aiming for its economic collapse to stop Putin&apos;s efforts to invade Ukraine. However, it is not only politicians who are threatened by penalties but common citizens. State Duma deputy from the Communist Party Nikolai Arefiev commented to a local news portal that savings of Russians could be confiscated by the Russian government: &apos;If all funds that are abroad are blocked, then the government will have no other choice but to seize all the deposits of the population - there are about 60 trillion rubles - in order to get out of the situation.&apos; Both Russians and Ukrainians have recorded enormous increases in crypto trading volume as they run to use it as a safe haven for their savings and wealth and a financial tool that allows them to take their money abroad or avoid sanctions. Similarly, bitcoin also became a valuable tool to send donations to Ukrainian efforts. The cryptocurrencies that have recorded the highest trading volumes in the countries have been bitcoin and tether.

42416586,e264UAkMOkEShzxWulVeBQ,1646173872,NFT Artist Pplpleasr’s New Project ‘Shibuya’ Brings Long-Form Animation to Web 3,"NFT artist Pplpleasr is bringing long-form animation to Web 3 through a new venture, Shibuya, which went live with its beta version on Tuesday.  Shibuya will crowdfund production of long-form visual content – such as short films, movies or television series – by selling non-fungible tokens (NFT) called “producer passes,” disrupting the traditional studio-driven methods that now dominate the industry.  Unveiled at the Ethereum Conference in Denver on Feb. 18, Shibuya is the latest brainchild of Pplpleasr, an NFT artist who first gained mainstream attention after her Fortune magazine NFT cover raised $1.3 million. Now, she’s pushing the boundaries of NFT use cases.  Shibuya is, in Pplpleasr’s own words, “a Web 3 experiment where long-form content is free to watch but monetized on the blockchain to allow viewer participation on the creative process and also shared ownership.”  The first Shibuya project will be an anime called “White Rabbit,” an interactive Web 3 series centered around a protagonist who goes down the crypto rabbit hole.  It’s like “anime meets ‘Black Mirror’ meets crypto,” said Pplpleasr (aka Emily Yang) at the project’s unveiling talk at ETHDenver last month.  While the series will be free to watch, viewers who hold the producer passes will be able to stake the NFTs to vote for one of two alternate endings to the first episode. The option that receives the most votes will determine the main character’s plot line in the next episode.  Additionally, the funds raised at mint will also go toward the film’s production. Each episode of “White Rabbit” will have its own unique producer pass NFT.  Pplpleasr told CoinDesk the inaugural mint of producer passes will be capped at 5,000 and priced at 0.08 ETH each (about $240 in current prices), first accessible only to a whitelist, or a pre-approved list of wallet addresses, on March 1. A second public mint is scheduled to go live Wednesday at 10 a.m. ET.  “The design of producer passes was inspired by movie ticket stubs,” explained Pplpleasr. “They can be a paper trail of all the episodes you watched.”  Viewers who vote by staking their producer passes will also earn WRAB, an ERC-20 token representing fractional ownership of the “White Rabbit” series. There is a fixed supply of WRAB tokens that will be distributed to the community as the series progresses.  “When the series completes, the whole thing is going to be minted as an NFT,” Pplplaesr told CoinDesk in an interview. “The token holders are essentially DAO members that can vote on the show’s future. Whether that’s getting involved with a bigger production company, going to another streaming platform, that’s up to the token holders.”  Read more: Ethereum Documentary Featuring Vitalik Buterin Raises 1,036 ETH  Pplpleasr’s first major crypto-based fundraising event came last July, when she partnered with the Ethereum Foundation to raise 1,036 ETH (around $3.1 million) for “The Infinite Garden,” a documentary about Ethereum.  Anime roots  The name Shibuya is a homage to a famously busy crosswalk in Japan that bears the same name.  Pplpleasr called Shibuya a “decentralized Hollywood” where “cultures and ideas meet in one eclectic and inspiring place.”  The project’s road map also includes a collaboration with crypto wallet application DegenScore.  The DegenScore collaboration would create gated Telegram chats whereby only holders of the producer passes could discuss the episode or write in the channel.  Eventually, the thinking goes, each Shibuya series would spawn its own token-gated community, similar to a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).

Powell is scheduled to appear before a House panel on Wednesday and a Senate committee on Thursday to give his semiannual monetary policy update to U.S. lawmakers.  The crypto community will be watching as the Fed chair will likely address topics like inflation, stablecoins and a potential central bank digital currency (CBDC).  “I think several non-monetary related items will be discussed [including] stablecoin regulatory frameworks, the Federal Reserve’s recent CBDC report, access for fintech and crypto charters to the Federal Reserve’s payment rails, and the potential effect that U.S. sanctions will have on the Central Bank of Russia,"" said Robert Baldwin, director of policy at the Association for Digital Asset Markets.  Powell could also discuss the risks of cryptocurrency to traditional financial markets. The memorandum for Wednesday's hearing, prepared by staff of the House Financial Services Committee, mentions the Financial Stability Oversight Council’s (FSOC) annual report from December highlighting “the rapid growth in cryptocurrency and stablecoins in 2021.” One concern was potential “spillover effects” from price volatility and speculation among these digital assets.  With the Ukraine-Russia conflict accelerating, the Fed chair’s testimony comes at a time of great uncertainty. The war changes everything, politically and economically, and in regard to the handling of monetary policy.  It has also become a major talking point in crypto markets.  Recent efforts by Ukrainians to collect money via crypto donations have shed light on potential benefits from the technology in times of crises. The country has received over $23.3 million worth of crypto in just three days.  Early in the conflict, cryptocurrency prices were down, trading in the red across the board, but the market turned on Monday, and bitcoin nearly hit $45,000 on Tuesday. Some analysts say Russians are turning to bitcoin and other cryptos as a safe haven.  At the same time, sanctions imposed on Russia are pushing oil prices up, now over $100 per barrel. Higher gasoline prices could add to inflation, already at a four-decade high.  However, some analysts think the Fed will take a less hawkish stance when it comes to hiking rates amid current geopolitical tensions and the resulting pressure on traditional markets. The CME Group's FedWatch tool currently shows traders see 0% odds of a half-percentage point hike, down from 40% odds last week.  “I do think that the situation in the Ukraine makes it much less likely they will raise by 50 basis points this time around,” PNC Chief Economist Gus Faucher told CNBC.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | COMMODITY | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/03/01/ukraine-adds-to-fed-chairs-list-of-worries-before-his-congressional-testimony,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/209c683e379c669f118fb907f44e17b8db0c3da8-1400x933.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Authorities across the globe are worried that non-state monetary networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum could enable Russia to evade economic sanction, while others think decentralized networks could help to raise funds quickly for a besieged nation.  “I want to use this opportunity to thank all the crypto guys who already helped us,” Chobanian said.  Transactions on most cryptocurrency networks are publicly viewable – one of the guarantees and essential attributes of the underlying blockchain technology. But that doesn’t always mean it’s clear how the funds are being used.  Ukraine, the second-poorest country in Europe based on gross national income per capita, has a long history of corruption. Some people are concerned that donations made in crypto, although traceable, may not benefit the intended recipients.  “We're doing it really efficiently,” Chobanian added. “The majority of spending is actually done in crypto.” He said he gives regular updates on where donations come from and go to every three hours on Twitter.  Chobanian has helped set up two charitable funds to aid Ukraine’s war effort and war-affected population, he said. The Crypto Fund of Ukraine, spun up two days ago, has primarily been used to buy food, gas, medical supplies and firearms for civilians and to help evacuate people, he said.  The second wallet, which is being coordinated by the Ministry of Digital Transformation, is funding the army. Chobanian’s exchange platform is assisting the government in converting crypto to fiat money, as “the government doesn't know how to properly manage the crypto,” he said.  That said, Ukraine's Defense Ministry is deciding on where donated crypto funds are going, CoinDesk previously reported.  Several high-profile crypto entrepreneurs have made big monetary contributions, including Polkadot and Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood, Tron founder Justin Sun and Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin, who was born in Russia and has spoken out against the war.  Read more: Ukraine Opens Polkadot Wallet for War Fundraising; Founder Wood Donates $5M in DOT  However, most of the funds made in lesser-known cryptocurrencies like DOT and tron are being converted into bitcoin and ether through the Kuna exchange, which has become central to these charitable efforts. “That’s the preferred method for most,” Chobanian said.  Kuna is working to ensure incoming donations are “clean,” and blacklisting suspicious transactions. “If it comes from the dark web, there is not much I can do with it later,” Chobanian said.  The crypto is then sent to cold storage, and guarded using a multisig, a type of wallet that involves multiple parties.  Last week, Chobanian told “First Mover” hosts the exchange was having difficulty meeting surging demand for the U.S. dollar-denominated cryptocurrency tether, or USDT. Wealthy clients had adopted the so-called stablecoin as a “safe haven,” he said. He gave that interview from his car.  Indeed, the invasion has severely affected Ukrainians. Speaking personally, Chobanian said his life has been upturned.  “You could look at whatever I’m wearing. This is pretty much all I have left,” he said. “I have two cars left. And I have my crypto. That’s pretty much it.”  Russia, too  Everyday Russian civilians have also been affected by the war. In response to Russian aggression, Western powers have levied strict financial sanctions on the country – including taking the unprecedented step to cut major financial institutions to the international SWIFT payments network.  The ruble has since cratered, and there’s evidence of many ATMs running out of cash. Now, there are calls for crypto exchanges, a small part of the global financial system, to block Russian users. Many have already frozen accounts thought to be associated with Russia oligarchs, as part of Western sanctions.  Ukraine Minister of Digital Transformation Mykhailo Fedorov, for instance, has asked that all major crypto exchanges block addresses of Russian users.  Read more: Ukraine Asks Exchanges to Freeze Russian, Belarusian Crypto Accounts  Kuna, alongside other cryptocurrency exchanges, has blocked the trading in digital rubles. But Chobanian sees blocking crypto from the Russian population as a bad idea.  “Being a crypto anarchist, I strongly oppose that,” he said. “Being Ukrainian who’s homeland is being bombed right now, it’s devastating. I have to balance between the rational and the emotional.”  That said, he does support freezing accounts tied to government officials. Further, due to unclear regulations, U.S. users are barred from his platform.  Does that mitigate the purpose of open, apolitical financial networks?  Pragmatically speaking, crypto has worked to fill a gap – like in quickly raising funds for Ukrainians. And it works because it’s fast, and in some respects, better than the alternative. “If you want to send money to Ukraine, to any government body, you have to do it via SWIFT, and SWIFT takes time. It’s not instant,” he said.  Additionally, crypto’s success is tied to accessibility. “There is no one to ask whether you can send your money or not,” Chobanian said about having to navigate the banking system, especially when larger sums of money are involved.  “If you own your own keys, you’re in charge.”",POSITIVE,DOT | USDT,BTC | DOT | ETH | EXCHANGE | USDT,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/03/01/at-least-14m-out-of-26m-in-donated-crypto-to-ukraine-already-disbursed,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5d3a450258b506eaae737ff2b3a2d7e339398940-2314x1224.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42422884,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0qZNh,1646170014,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Decouples From Stocks Ahead of Seasonally Weak March,"Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies ended February with a sharp rebound, which extended into March, albeit at a slower pace.  It appears that bearish sentiment is starting to fade despite ongoing geopolitical risk. For example, the bitcoin Fear & Greed Index, which measures the mood among crypto traders, rose from ""extreme fear"" territory and is back around neutral levels.  Meanwhile, bitcoin's average trading volume across spot exchanges reached the highest level since December on Tuesday, which could be an early sign of capitulation among sellers. The ratio of buy volume relative to sell volume also ticked higher over the past week, suggesting renewed bullish activity.  Still, other market indicators are neutral as some buyers remain on the sidelines.  Traders in bitcoin's perpetual swaps market are ""not convinced by the recent rally,"" according to a report by Arcane Research. ""Despite yesterday’s liquidation uptick, the perpetual swap open interest remained fairly stable, falling from 223,000 BTC to 219,000 BTC, suggesting that traders are actively re-adjusting risk,"" the firm wrote.  Historically, March tends to be a difficult month for bitcoin and equities. Analysts expect macroeconomic and geopolitical risks to linger, which could cause short-term volatility. At a later point, price action could stabilize as the probability of positive BTC returns increases over the next few months.  Latest prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $44035, +5.83%    ●Ether (ETH): $2968, +5.36%    ●S&P 500 daily close: $4306, −1.55%    ●Gold: $1949 per troy ounce, +2.59%    ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 1.71%     Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time. Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Mixed returns in February  February was a volatile month in crypto markets, triggered by macroeconomic and geopolitical risks. Still, there were some clear winners such as XRP, which outperformed the CoinDesk 20 crypto list with a 29% return. The CoinDesk 20 filters thousands of cryptocurrencies by market capitalization and trading volume across exchanges.  Ethereum classic (ETC) and bitcoin cash (BCH), both spin-offs of their respective blockchains, also posted strong gains in February. Meanwhile, bitcoin experienced a 12% gain, driven by the sharp price recovery over the past week.  Other alternative cryptocurrencies such as Chainlink's LINK, Algorand's ALGO and Cardano's ADA declined more than 8% in February. Bitcoin's outperformance relative to altcoins suggests a lower appetite for risk among crypto investors.  Bitcoin also outperformed traditional markets in February, albeit with greater volatility.  The chart below shows bitcoin's leap toward the end of the month, which was well ahead of gold's 5% gain and the S&P 500's 3% loss.  Bitcoin's risk-adjusted return was also greater than the S&P 500 stock index over the past 30 days, but has lagged stocks over the past three months, according to data from IntoTheBlock. That means crypto investors experienced greater price swings to generate returns versus traditional investors.  Seasonally weak March  On average, over the past nine years, bitcoin has produced negative returns in March, according to data from StockCharts. While past returns are no guarantee of future returns, investors are still bracing themselves for economic and political uncertainty next month.  ""This is a very difficult environment for risky assets,"" Edward Moya, an analyst at Oanda, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. Inflation will likely become the focal point among investors next month, which could pressure central banks to be more aggressive with tightening monetary policy, according to Moya.  ""If financial markets grow nervous that the [U.S.] Federal Reserve will become more aggressive in removing accommodation, bitcoin could settle back to the lower boundaries of its widening trading range just below the $40,000 level,"" Moya wrote.  Still, Moya expects downside could be limited given the recent stabilization in crypto prices.

42421844,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXwSNR,1646169923,What's the Most Profitable NFT Strategy: Buying at Mint or Later?,"In April 2021, a little known non-fungible token (NFT) project launched on the Ethereum blockchain: Bored Ape Yacht Club. Early investors were given the opportunity to “mint” – or create a new token – for just 0.08 ETH. Nearly one year later, the floor price to get in is 86.99 ETH, after celebrities including Jimmy Fallon and Steph Curry began collecting the art pieces.  With the increasing popularity of NFTs, there’s no shortage of projects launching daily, each promising climbing prices and community benefits for early adopters. Does it make sense to get into an NFT at launch or should investors wait to see the project’s trajectory?  The answer depends on your individual investing strategy, along with your goals for collecting NFTs.  The process of minting a new NFT  For artists, developers and community managers, opening an NFT for minting is the culmination of their work. With most projects, the minting process happens in three different waves: the first mint for whitelisted community members, a small presale group and the open public sale.  Whitelist, presale and public sale: What’s the difference?  In many situations, the first people to get access to a new NFT project are the whitelist members. The whitelist is usually limited to the earliest supporters of a project, which may include early investors and the most engaged community members. Getting on the whitelist offers the chance to get into an NFT on the ground floor – with the highest odds of creating a piece with the rarest attributes.  Once whitelist members get the first chance to mint a new NFT, projects may open up to their presale list. Like they do with the whitelist round, the NFT developers will set the requirements to get on the presale list, but the requirements are often much less stringent than they are for the whitelist.  After both rounds are complete, minting will open up to the public, allowing anyone to create a new NFT. While you can still mint pieces with rare attributes, the likelihood of creating one with the most desired aspect may diminish based on how many were distributed through the private sale rounds and the total number of NFTs available.  Read More: What You Need to Know About Buying NFTs at Presales and Public Mints  How do NFT airdrops work?  To encourage more NFT sales or increase excitement about a project, some NFT producers may decide to “air drop” pieces, granting free tokens to certain wallet holders. While some communities may give airdrops to celebrities or prominent members with a big social media following, the most common way to get a free NFT is through minting several at a time.  Airdrops can be an easy way to earn free NFTs and lower your total cost per token, but with an inherent risk. For example, if a new project mints tokens at 0.05 ETH each and offers one free airdrop for minting five at the same time, you would get six for a total cost of 0.25 ETH. Although you would effectively save around $25 per token, you would have to spend over $650 to get the airdrop (based on ETH price at the time of writing).  Read More: What’s a Crypto Airdrop?  Pros and cons of minting a new NFT  When it comes to backing new NFT projects, there are some upsides for being among the first to mint new tokens. The earliest investors can get in at the lowest price, giving them the best potential of increasing the return on their NFT investment. One investor who purchased a collection of Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs later sold his collection at Sotheby’s auction for $19 million.  Another reason to get into an NFT at the ground level is for the community aspect. Depending on the project, the earliest adopters may get additional benefits for their contribution. For instance, some NFTs may give token holders entry into the project’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), giving them a stake in where the project goes or how the community purse is used. Others may get additional airdrops from affiliate projects, increasing their NFT holdings for being part of the community.  Although there appears to be a lot of upsides to getting into an NFT project early, it also comes with a significant amount of risk. Like with any investment, there is no guarantee that the value will go up over time, and the token can even drop sharply in price after mint. When Pixelmon launched its NFT project as part of a play-to-earn game environment, early adopters could mint their token for 3 ETH. But as of this writing in March 2022, Generation 1 Pixelmon were trading on NFT marketplace OpenSea at a floor price of 0.429 ETH, representing a discount of over $7,600 from mint.  Moreover, network activity can ultimately drive your entry price up, depending on how many people are clamoring for a spot in the mint. When a highly anticipated NFT goes live, the increased activity from whitelist and presale members trying to be first in line can drive up gas fees, which can significantly increase your entry price.  Because there are no guarantees in the digital art world, you may face an extended timeline before you could sell your token for a profit, if it increases in price at all. Should you decide to mint a new NFT, be prepared to hold it for an extended period of time before you can sell it for as much or more than your purchase price.  Read More: Minting Your First NFT: A Beginner’s Guide to Creating an NFT  Pros and cons of buying an NFT at market  While minting in a new NFT project can be exciting, there are some advantages to not buying an NFT at launch. Purchasing a token at OpenSea or Rarible, another marketplace, could give you insight into demand and give you a potential advantage on your investment.  When browsing NFTs on both major marketplaces, buyers are given analytical insight into the transaction history, price changes over time and how often an individual token changed hands. That information may allow buyers to determine the right time to dive into an NFT as it increases in price, without blindly buying into a project.  In addition, buying an NFT at market can help you save on overall costs. Timing your purchase when network activity is low can save money on gas fees, giving you the opportunity to get in at a reduced price point compared to minting.  Much like there is risk in getting into an NFT early, there’s also jeopardy in waiting for owners to list tokens on a marketplace. If a NFT gets popular quickly, the price can increase significantly overnight. For example: When the highly popular Gutter Cat Gang launched, the mint price was 0.07 ETH. As of this writing, the floor price to buy on OpenSea is over 5 ETH – an increase of over 7,100%.  Bottom Line: Should I Buy an NFT at Launch or Wait Until Later?  Getting into an NFT early should come with careful consideration. The decision should come down to your tolerance to risk and overall crypto investment strategy.  Before you decide to mint an NFT, do your research into the community, its goals and overall reach. Joining the project’s dedicated Discord server and monitoring social media mentions can help you gauge excitement and anticipation for the launch, ultimately helping you make the best decision for your money.  If you do decide to get in on a mint, research how to get on the whitelist early to potentially avoid paying high gas fees during the initial rush at the public sale. If you are uncertain about the community direction or the potential demand for a token, it may be smart to hold off to buy at market, giving you the chance to get in at a price that fits your risk tolerance and strategy better.

42421650,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXotTx,1646169041,Why Crypto Networks Should Preserve Russian Propaganda,"Yesterday, Twitter, Facebook and other social media companies announced they would begin targeted attempts of removing Russian disinformation, one of the aggressor nation’s most potent weapons in its attack on Ukraine. As harmful as “fake news” and propaganda can be, there’s a strong case that evidence of this information war should be preserved.  Although private companies have every right – and sometimes the legal or moral obligation – to curate their platforms by removing or boosting content according to their own prerogatives and bottom lines, understanding history is often as dependent on remembering lies as documenting facts.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Decentralized crypto platforms are designed to be information-agnostic, making them potentially important venues for understanding these times of conflict. By distributing trust and replicating data across nodes worldwide, they ensure this information remains undoctored.  That’s at least partly why Sam Williams, founder of decentralized storage platform Arweave, has called for people to back up and save the disparate accounts of the war using his platform. In particular, he’s looking to record the same “fake news” that Twitter and Facebook are removing.  “We built Arweave in this way to ensure that records of history cannot be altered after they happen,” Williams told CoinDesk in a private message. It’s “a global, permanent archive that anyone can write to.”  Examples of Russian disinformation are widespread – from unsubstantiated accounts of Ukrainian border guards welcoming Russian soldiers to photos of the Ukrainian army deploying chemical weapons or using civilians as human shields.  Further, there’s evidence that the Kremlin, Russia’s intelligence agency, had a premeditated media strategy meant to set the narrative of the war, (which they hoped was quicker than it it turning out to be). On Feb. 26, for instance, state-owned media conglomerate Ria Novosti published a triumphant article declaring Russia had succeeded in its “special military operation.”  Before being taken down, the article stated that Russia had restored “its historical fullness” by “gathering the Russian world,” and uniting “the Russian people” against Western aggressors.  Clearly, having these contested claims circulate in wider conversation could increase misunderstanding of the conflict. Fake news is often less about getting people wholeheartedly to believe a false narrative, than simply sowing distrust of credible facts and institutions. It’s a messy business, and one that needs serious investigation.  As media site Protocol noted, tech giants have long-enforced their “corporate content-moderation policies” by removing “sock-puppet accounts” and posts tied to Russian content farms. Last week, Twitter, Google and Facebook began to limit Russian advertisements to stop the spread of fake news.  The social media companies’ actions here are protected first by the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment, which allows private organizations to speak freely, including to moderate or censor discussions, and Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects internet platforms from liability if they choose to allow certain content .  But these ads, sock-puppets, false flags, distorted narratives, crisis actors and outright lies are all significant. Withholding information from public view, including articles from sanctioned media outlets and spam, might diminish our understanding of Russia’s campaign and Putin’s motivations. Itmight also prevent activists, writers and legal institutions from holding bad actors to account.  “If we had not stored information that we now know to be false in our archives surrounding the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the Vietnam war or the 1939 invasion of Poland, we would not understand how these wars started,” Arweave’s Williams said.  “In each of these cases, 'facts' we later realized were at least partially untrue” – including the “existence/non-existence of WMDs in Iraq, the Gulf of Tonkin incident in Vietnam, and the Gleiwitz incident in 1939” – “were all initially misreported in some form,” he added.  There are sustained calls from influential people for deleting Russian propaganda. Jim Lewis, a cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Vox, “During the Cold War, we would never let Pravda publish in the United States.” Graham Brookie, a senior director at The Atlantic Council, said, “you have to mitigate online harms that make war worse for humans.” Others go further in calling for the expulsion of Russian students and employees from U.S. institutions.  Calls for censorship also come from the other side. In early 2019, the Kremlin began disconnecting Russia from the global internet, allowing them to control what information civilians can view. The agency routinely asks social giants to block information – calls that Facebook (with ~70 million Russian users), among others, often happily follows – lest it lose access to the entire market. (Russia has also threatened tech employees with imprisonment during disputes.)  Social giants mostly follow the speech laws of the countries they operate in, even if they must abandon the lofty ideals of “free speech.”  See also: Protecting Free Speech With Decentralized Tech | Opinion  Open, decentralized platforms operate according to different, perhaps higher, values that information should always be readily accessible, unadulterated and durable. Several crypto exchanges, including Binance and Kraken, took a similar line when declining to follow traditional financial institutions from “freezing” Russian accounts (though official economic sanctions may change that position).  Crypto, in its truest form, presents a permissive view of data and finance – both money and information should be free. This perspective places a high degree of trust and responsibility on users to think critically about what they’re consuming and in what they’re investing. But it’s perhaps the only consistent standard that can be applied.  All other ways of reckoning with or packaging information are subject to the whims of human judgment, coercion and sanction.  Recentralization?  William’s first call to action to document the war came earlier this month, before shots were fired. Over 10 million documents related to the war have since been preserved, according to its block finder. But his Berlin-based company has long been trying to bridge the gap between the Western internet and Russia’s limited web.  The team recently announced it raised $17.2 million to fund its “gateways” – the bridges that connect users to Arweave’s “permaweb.” “Gateways are generally difficult and costly to run and upkeep. There’s no upside for the gateway operator, either. It’s a pure expense,” an Arweave trade publication wrote on Feb. 28.  Indeed, many so-called decentralized platforms struggle to reach that point. Many, too, feel compelled to include points of centralization in their products and operations.  Like other blockchain-based systems, Arweave users are incentivized to use and keep the platform alive through token payments, but development and upkeep is primarily done through William’s core team and paid for by a roster of venture capitalists titans, including Andreessen Horowitz, Union Square Ventures and Coinbase Ventures.  Note that Arweave, founded in 2017, is funding people to collect and store information related to the Ukrainian invasion as part of a grant-system that also pays people to operate nodes. This dynamic isn’t an issue in itself –lot’s of Web 3 projects “bootstrap” use through token schemes. But it may raise questions about the sustainability of long-term data storage.  Information wants to be free, and there are tools that help that effort. But human beings need to participate.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | BNB | AR,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/03/01/why-crypto-networks-should-preserve-russian-propaganda,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/73efe3e5e265334139a90d4e785460782c804778-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42416571,e264UAkMOkEShzxWulVdfK,1646168048,Florida Judge Denies Kleiman Estate’s Request for New Trial Against Craig Wright,"There will be no new trial in the case of the estate of David Kleiman versus Craig Wright, the Australian computer programmer best known for his widely disputed claims to be the inventor of Bitcoin.  On Monday, Florida judge Beth Bloom struck down a motion by attorneys for Ira Kleiman – the brother of Wright’s deceased friend and collaborator, Dave – for a new trial, citing the violation of a court order to not discuss Kleiman’s troubled relationship with his brother.  Kleiman, on behalf of Dave’s estate, sued Wright in a Florida court for allegedly stealing his brother’s fair share of intellectual property the pair supposedly developed together (including the Bitcoin IP, the plaintiffs claimed) and bitcoins they were said to have mined jointly. Kleiman said the two created a business entity – W&K Info Defense Research – to develop and mine bitcoin, but Wright’s attorneys attempted to convince the jury the entity was a failed attempt by Dave and Wright’s ex-wife to get government contracts for software development.  The attempt worked – mostly. After five weeks in the courtroom detailing the convoluted relationships between Wright and the Kleiman family, as well as Wright’s legal issues with the Australian Taxation Office, the jury ultimately sided with Wright on all but one of the charges.  The jury found Wright guilty of intellectual property theft and ordered him to pay $100 million in damages to W&K. The verdict did not address, one way or the other, Wright’s claim to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, whose real identity has never been conclusively determined.  The legal battle rages on  Attorneys for Kleiman’s estate initially hailed the outcome of the trial as a win, but their motion for a new trial filed on Jan. 4 details their concern that, by hinting about the estrangement between Ira and Dave, Wright’s attorneys unfairly swayed the jury.  The court disagreed, finding that the plaintiff’s arguments were ultimately “unpersuasive and insufficient to warrant a new trial.” Bloom added that Kleiman’s attorneys failed to object to questions about the brothers’ relationship during the trial.  Andres Rivero, the lead attorney for Wright, said that Judge Bloom ""got this just right, ruling to sustain the jury’s plain and compelling verdict for Dr. Wright.""  Vel Freedman, lead attorney for the plaintiffs, told CoinDesk the next step was to appeal Bloom’s decision.  Then, there’s the matter of the $100 million bill – which Freedman said could be bumped to $140 million if Kleiman’s motion to add prejudgment interest is approved.  “Since [Wright] has not filed for an appeal, nor bonded that amount, enforcement begins right away,” Freedman said. “And since he’s failed to make a single payment on it, we’ll begin enforcement.”  UPDATE (March 2, 16:19 UTC): Updated with quote from Wright's attorney.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/03/01/florida-judge-denies-kleiman-estates-request-for-new-trial-against-craig-wright,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/214e3305ed5c22d5e5ca6fb8de703fd22a5a46d6-1980x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42416587,e264UAkMOkEShzxWulVeEd,1646167732,Bitcoin HODLers Unfazed by Macro and Geopolitical Risks,"Despite the macro and geopolitical risks currently heightened by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, bitcoin (BTC) HODLers continue to accumulate, according to blockchain data from Glassnode.  Bitcoin's price is higher since the invasion started last week, gaining 15% in the last 24 hours. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was trading around $43,500 at press time.  On-chain data from Glassnode suggests it is a HODLer-dominated market, meaning investors are holding onto their cryptocurrency for future profits rather than selling.  HODLing is crypto slang, referring to a buy-and-hold strategy where traders stay invested and refrain from selling when the asset price decreases.  “Despite this very uncertain macro and geopolitical backdrop, the behavior of bitcoin HODLers maintain a remarkably bullish conviction,” said the Glassnode report, published Tuesday.  3 Charts Showing Strong Hands Stacking  1. Illiquid Supply  Illiquid Supply, which tracks the volume of coins held in wallets with little to no history of spending, has surpassed the May 2021 peak, reaching 76%.  “We can make an estimation that this is likely, in part, a sign of accumulation,” James Check, analyst at Glassnode, said in an email to CoinDesk.  These often represent coins socked away in cold storage, or storing crypto offline, and the wallets of HODLers who undertake a dollar-cost averaging strategy, said Glassnode’s weekly report.  2. Realized Cap HODL Waves  The Realized Cap HODL wave bands older than three months are pushing to new highs of 72%. This means that 72% of the dollar value stored in bitcoin is held by coins three months and older.  “This is typical of bear markets where long-term investors see value and simultaneously slow their spending,” said the report. “Note that much of this recent uplift is driven by the three-month- to six-month-old age band. These are coins that are approaching or in the process of crossing the short-to-long-term holder boundary of 155 days.”  3. Three-Month Coin Maturation Wave  Glassnode data also tracks the coin volume crossing the three-month age threshold over the last 30 days.  “Statistically, the older a coin is, the more likely it is held by a 'strong hand' HODLer and less likely to be spent and sold,” said Check.  A similar magnitude of HODLing behavior was seen in mid-2020 and June-September 2021, both of which preceded upside moves.  The report noted that although uncertainty from macroeconomic events prevails, coins continue to be withdrawn from exchanges, are moving into increasingly illiquid wallets and are maturing into increasingly senior age bands at a high rate.  These look like long-term holder coins (wallet addresses holding bitcoin greater than a 155-day period) in the making and therefore less likely to be spent and sold, according to Glassnode.  “It is now key to watch in case these coherent trends begin to reverse, which may signal broad-scale loss of confidence,” said the report.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/03/01/bitcoin-hodlers-unfazed-by-macro-and-geopolitical-risks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7dc7468f94db6ccf9eba7ebfcf896692b13d9085-2048x1536.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42420988,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXAqcP,1646165895,'Absolutely Surreal': Inside a Fund Raising Millions in Crypto for Besieged Ukraine,"After Russia invaded Ukraine, Andriy Velikiy would look out his window at night and count the lights in the windows of nearby buildings. Around 90% of them stayed black.  The cryptocurrency entrepreneur‘s apartment building faced Kyiv’s Maidan Square. Normally full of people, it’s empty and silent now, except for the sirens blaring from time to time.  Some of his friends chose to leave the city when they could. Others are now fighting the invading Russian forces on the frontlines.  Read more: Russian Government Introduces Crypto Bill to Parliament Over Central Bank Objections  “I chose to stay somewhere in between. I’ll stay here in my apartment and protect my family here,” Velikiy, a member of a local shooting club, told CoinDesk on Monday. “And if things get worse – [I] will go to the frontlines.” On Tuesday, he posted on Facebook that he had left Kyiv with his family.  Velikiy wears several hats. He is the CEO of Apyswap Foundation and co-founder of Allbridge, a startup working on cross-chain integrations and building bridges between blockchains. Many of his employees have moved to the western part of Ukraine, a bit farther from Russian tanks and rockets than Kyiv.  He’s also a key member of the team behind the Unchain fund – a vehicle raising money to buy food, clothing, medicine, evacuation and repairs for civilians and everything but weapons for the army. Unchain accepts donations to multi-signature wallets on the Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Harmony, Avalanche, Near and Celo networks.  The project is one of several ways the Ukrainian crypto community has spontaneously coordinated fundraising attempts during a conflict that has killed hundreds of civilians and stoked fears of a new Cold War between Russia and the West.  Parallel efforts include UkraineDAO, formed with the help of Russian art collective Pussy Riot, and the Ukrainian government’s own crypto fundraiser. UkraineDAO has raised 1,570 ETH ($4.6 million). Official Ukrainian government addresses have received over 200 BTC ($8.7 million) and 1,639 ETH ($4.8 million). Come Back Alive, a group supporting the Ukrainian army, raised over 195 BTC ($8.5 million). According to an estimate by Forklog, a Russian-language crypto news outlet, various organizations raising crypto for Ukraine have received over $58 million in donations over the past six days.  This week, the Unchain fund is planning to launch a distributed autonomous organization (DAO) to make decisions about how to spend the funds. Things progress slowly but surely, Velikiy said. “Because everything is so secure and decentralized, it’s very slow,” he said.  Despite such drawbacks compared with traditional fundraising methods, crypto has benefits, too – such as a public audit trail of the donations.  “It’s a matter of our reputation that the funds raised transparently with blockchain technology are used for things we declared to fund,” said Alexey Bobok, a сo-founder of Unchain.  Multi-signature wallets  The Unchain wallets’ signers include, along with Velikyi, Gitcoin co-founder Scott Moore, Near Protocol co-founder Illia Polosukhin, MetaCartel community lead Peter Pan, Harmony community manager Nick Vasilich and others. There are nine keyholders in total.  “Our goal is to break the chain of war and scatter its links far away from each other. So that they could never meet again,” the organization’s website says.  Read More: Ukrainian Government Receives Nearly $10M in Crypto Donations After Russian Invasion  Each multisig wallet is going to be configured so that five or six out of 10 signatures would be needed to spend funds, Velikiy said. The development work is still ongoing, but the donation addresses have already received over $1.8 million in crypto, according to the website – CoinDesk’s own analysis of the wallets confirms that.  The funds raised will be used to support several non-governmental organizations, including Voices of Children, International Medical Corps and People in Need, the website says.  Rev Miller, co-founder of a metaverse project Atlantis World, says there are hundreds of volunteers now helping Unchain with everything from tech support to physically evacuating people from unsafe locations. Some of them are in Ukraine, including Miller’s own family.  The first $1.3 million in crypto flew to Unchain’s wallets in less than 12 hours, Miller said, adding that the Near community was the most active to contribute.  Bobok, who is also сo-founder of Weld.Money, said he started Unchain with co-founder Alexey Meretskiy in January, when the war hadn't yet started. However, he, as well as many Ukrainians, would tell you that the war actually started eight years ago in 2014, when Russia annexed the Crimea peninsula and sent unmarked troops and weaponry to the breakaway region of Donbass in the eastern part of Ukraine.  Last month, the tensions around the Ukrainian border intensified, and in mid-February, the founders convened a working group and started reaching out to the NGOs and Ukraine’s Ministry of Defense, Bobok said.  Velikiy said that there is also a smaller wallet with only one signature needed to spend: It’s being used by participants to fund some immediate needs.  For example, he just cashed out $1,000 to send to a local baker who is baking fresh bread and giving it away to people living around his place in Kyiv, he said. In a few other instances, funds were spent to buy things like clothes, socks and medical supplies for the army and buses to evacuate people from the city of Kharkiv, which is suffering heavy shelling by Russian artillery.  Read more: SOL, ETH Rise With Bitcoin as War Continues After Russia, Ukraine Hold Peace Talks  About $50,000 has been spent so far in total, he said. Unchain is already speaking to the International Committee of the Red Cross about helping the humanitarian organization evacuate people who are in danger, according to Bobok. The Red Cross didn’t respond to a request for comment from CoinDesk by press time.  But the bulk of the funds raised will be held in the multisigs, with some of the key holders outside Ukraine.  “Our thinking was that we need to invite reputable people who will take responsibility in front of the crypto community and no one of them would have access to all funds at once. Then if things get worse, some people with access would still be around and we won’t lose the funds,” Velikiy said.  And things indeed can get worse.  Evacuate Ukraine or stay and fight?  On Feb. 24, Velikiy’s wife drove to the grocery store and brought home a car full of food, he said. That was a good call, because the family had enough food to go for several days, and food has become harder to buy: When there is no curfew, people rush to the stores and sweep all the food off the shelves.  Before the Russian military assault on Ukraine started, Velikiy spoke of his friends’ plans to evacuate from Kyiv with sarcasm. Back then, few people in Ukraine or Russia believed there would be an invasion and bombshelling of all major Ukrainian cities.  Read more: No, Crypto Won't 'Fix This' for Russia  “We had been going back and forth on whether we should evacuate people or not, and ended up choosing not to, unfortunately, because until last week we didn't believe that this would happen,” says Anatoly Kaplan, founder of Forklog. Kaplan himself lives outside Ukraine; half of his team, or about 20 people, are in the country.  Only a few of his Ukrainian employees left the country during the past several days, he said, all of them young women.  “Guys decided to stay so that they can, if needed, grab their guns and go into the battle,” Kaplan said, adding that one of his staffers is now a fighter in the territorial defense squad in the city of Zaporizhzhia.  “At some point in Kyiv, there were fewer weapons than [civilian] people willing to fight,” Kaplan said.  According to his estimates, around 10% of the local crypto community left Ukraine in anticipation of the war, especially those who are closely working with partners or clients in Western Europe or the U.S. Velikiy said he believes the number could be as high as 20%.  Ukraine has been a significant tech hub for the global blockchain and cryptocurrency industry, with multiple developers and validators either coming from Ukraine or physically based there. For example, a notable number of Tezos validators, Solana developers, and developers and validators for Near protocol had been based in Ukraine, Kaplan said.  Polosukhin, Near’s founder, said the news about the war hit as he was about to come back home from the ETHDenver conference in the U.S.  “Our folks mostly managed to get out of the hot spots and move to the West. Many validators took their servers out [of the country] in advance as the tensions were rising,” Polosukhin told CoinDesk. He said he decided to support Unchain as it has been the only fund not raising money for buying weapons.  Kyiv under fire  For six days Velikiy, his wife and 1-year-old son lived in the heart of a besieged city, along with other civilians. Every day, their background noise was artillery barrage, explosions and sirens. When the sirens went off, the family would go downstairs to the underground parking lot serving as a bomb shelter.  He said that by the fifth day of the war, he didn’t care to spend too much time underground and preferred to sleep at home. Fortunately, cellphone and internet service were still good in the city, and the payment infrastructure stays functional, as well.  The Unchain fund’s idea has always been to fund humanitarian aid, like food, clothing and medicines but not weapons. Some participants are very particular about not helping the armed forces at all.  “There is a discussion ongoing if we should be spending funds on [military] equipment like thermal imagers and collimators – different people view that differently,” Velikiy said.  The peace negotiations that started on Monday brought a bit of hope, Velikiy said. Everyone was hoping that the war would stop soon and life would go back to normal. With the shelling intensifying in Kharkiv and Kyiv on Tuesday, however, that hope is fading.  “What’s happening now is absolutely surreal,” Bobok said.  Sage D.

42416578,e264UAkMOkEShzxWulVdsA,1646164678,Crypto Exchange-Traded Products Are Blossoming in Europe,"The crypto exchange-traded products (ETP) market in Europe is becoming more competitive compared with North American and Latin America, and issuers are launching more of the investment vehicles because of increasing demand, says a top industry analyst.  On Monday the Swiss asset manager Valour Inc. listed two new ETPs on the Nordic Growth Market, which operates in Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Norway. The firm has listed Valour Terra and the Valour Avalanche ETPs.  ETPs are proving to be a very popular way for European institutional investors to gain access to crypto. Banks including Goldman Sachs, ICAP, JPMorgan and UBS have all bought ETPs for an increasing number of clients. With interest growing, so are the types of ETPs being listed.  Last month, asset manager Fidelity International listed the Fidelity Physical Bitcoin ETP on the Deutsche Börse in Frankfurt and SIX Swiss Exchange in Zurich. That product is available to investment firms and institutional clients in Europe.  There are now 73 crypto ETPs in Europe, with $7 billion in assets or 57% of the global crypto ETP industry, as of Feb. 25, Deborah Fuhr, managing partner and founder of ETFGI, which tracks the ETF industry, told CoinDesk.  So far, Canada has 17 crypto exchange-traded funds (ETF) or ETPs available, the U.S. has three ETFs and Latin America has seven products available to investors, reports ETFGI.  Why is Europe at the forefront on listing crypto ETPs?  “We are seeing an increase in the number of issuers launching crypto ETPs in Europe as more investors are doing due diligence on investing in crypto and some are starting to add some bitcoin and other crypto exposures to their portfolios,” said Fuhr.  According to ETFGI, assets of $12.4 billion were invested in 100 crypto ETFs or ETPs listed globally at the end of January.  XBT Provider is the largest ETP provider in terms of assets with $3.1 billion, or a 25% market share, according to Fuhr. 21Shares is second with $1.7 billion and a 14% share.  In 2020, the crypto ETP market exploded, more than quadrupling to a then-record $3.1 billion, says Laurent Kssis, a crypto ETF expert and director of CEC Capital, citing data from Trackinsight.  Much of the interest has been driven by the success of bitcoin (BTC), fueled by a continued public embrace of cryptocurrencies by large institutions such as Ruffer, the U.K. investment manager, according to Kssis.  “However, it's pretty clear institutional interest hasn't done for bitcoin what it was supposed to do, and that is to establish the cryptocurrency as a digital safe haven better than gold,” Kssis said.

42416601,e264UAkMOkEShzxWulVdYu,1646162219,Bitcoin Extends Rally After Biggest Gain in Year,"Bitcoin (BTC) was pushing higher after surging 14% on Monday, the biggest price jump in a year.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was changing hands at $43,922 at press time.  Bitcoin’s performance on Monday took the price back to where it stood in early February, well before it became clear that Russia was planning to invade Ukraine.  The risks from a prolonged war prompted many crypto investors to worry that a new cloud over the economy might sap demand for bitcoin. But the market sentiment turned quickly, and now some traders are speculating that the Federal Reserve might soften any plans to tighten monetary policy aggressively.  Fed Chair Jerome Powell is set to address Congress on Wednesday.  “Fed tightening won’t be severe at the start, and with yields tumbling hard, this should be an attractive time for cryptos,” said Edward Moya, analyst at Oanda.  Marcus Sotiriou, analyst at GlobalBlock, noted that markets are now seeing a potentially more accommodative Federal Reserve – a key shift given that “major tightening policy was a major catalyst for stocks and crypto to fall over the past few months.”  Bitcoin is down 8% year to date, gaining ground on gold, seen by many investors in traditional financial markets as a safe haven during times of geopolitical turmoil and reduced risk-taking.

Last time such a trend happened was back in July 2021, following which a new bull rally occurred. Lackluster Bitcoin Sell-Off Recently May Suggest Top Buyers Have Already Capitulated As per the latest weekly report from Glassnode, there hasn&apos;t been any significant loss realization recently despite world-changing events taking place this week. The relevant on-chain indicator here is the &apos;net realized profit/loss,&apos; which tells us whether the overall Bitcoin market is realizing profits or losses right now. The metric works by looking at each coin on the blockchain to see what price it last moved at. If this price is less than the current price (that is, the selling price), then the coin sold at a profit. Investors harvesting a large amount of profit generally leads to a correction in the price. On the other hand, the buying price being more than the current one would imply a realization of loss. The Bitcoin market observing a significant amount of losses being realized can be a sign of widespread capitulation. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the BTC net realized profit/loss over the past year: The value of the indicator seems to have been slightly negative recently | Source: Glassnode&apos;s The Week Onchain - Week 9, 2022 As you can see in the above graph, it looks like a net amount of loss has been realized ...",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/data-bitcoin-top-buyers-capitulated-bull-rally/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

42421664,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXotfJ,1646161022,Russian Sanctions May Test Crypto's Proposition,"A coalition of countries including the U.S. and European Union want to freeze the Russian central bank’s international reserves and lock (some) Russian banks out of the global financial system.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  New financial order  The narrative  Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has set the stage for a sea change in how we perceive the global financial system. This is what the crypto industry has been waiting for.  Why it matters  The present set of geopolitical and financial factors might make this crypto’s moment. Certainly it’s a test of cryptocurrency’s proposition value of being a stateless means of exchange. Is the industry ready?  Breaking it down  Russia invaded Ukraine last week. After massing 200,000 soldiers along its border with Ukraine, one of the world’s largest nations launched cruise missiles, aircraft, warships and land convoys into its neighbor.  In response, a coalition of nations including the U.S., U.K., European Union, Canada, Japan, South Korea and several others have pledged to lock Russia’s largest banks out of the SWIFT global financial system, seize Russian assets and otherwise make it difficult for Russia’s economy to continue as is.  This has led some to say this might be crypto’s moment.  And you know what? I think it might be. Ukraine suspended electronic money transfers and its ATMs are running out of cash but the country has received millions in crypto fundraising – both the government and charity/NGO groups – that are being used to purchase critical goods.  Russian oligarchs or individuals might be turning to crypto as a flight to safety after the Russian ruble crashed.  As I stated last week, I do not mean to minimize the loss of life or scale of destruction in any way. This is a tragic and unnecessary war launched by a would-be emperor.  (For what it’s worth, I don’t think I necessarily agree with the idea that crypto will be the tool for officials to evade sanctions.)  That being said, all of the conversation surrounding this so far sounds like it’s an asset or a tool, rather than a currency existing within its own circular economy. My view is basically unchanged from last week’s newsletter, but we’re not yet seeing a scenario where bitcoin (or any other cryptocurrency) is being used solely as a means of exchange.  Russia’s response to these sanctions so far seems to have been to double down, which in turn will likely lead to further economic sanctions.  Today, the EU’s European Commission is supposed to be meeting to determine how to remove Russia’s largest banks from the SWIFT interbank messaging system.  Bank of Russia chief Elvira Nabiullina claims Russia has a SWIFT alternative for domestic payments, and is inviting international banks to also participate. Whether it’s successful will depend entirely on whether these other banks want to risk being cut out of SWIFT themselves and whether they see the ruble as a viable alternative to the dollar as a world reserve currency.  So far, this seems unlikely.  I imagine we’ll have more to say on this in the coming week. For now, I want to refer you all to the coverage CoinDesk has put out over the past eight days, which really covers the wide range of issues at play here. Some selected stories:  Ruble-Denominated Bitcoin Volume Surges to 9-Month High  Ukraine Asks Binance, Coinbase, 6 Other Crypto Exchanges to Block Russian Users  Ukraine Lawyer Says They Have Received Numerous Russian Wallet Addresses for Crypto 'Blacklist'  Ukrainian Government Receives Nearly $10M in Crypto Donations After Russian Invasion  Tether's USDT Stablecoin Well Over $1 on Ukrainian Crypto Exchange  No, Crypto Won't 'Fix This' for Russia (disclosure: I wrote this one)  On another note, there is a continuing, massive humanitarian crisis in Ukraine right now.

Another problem with cryptocurrency investing is picking which projects to invest in, especially with over 10,000 cryptocurrencies accessible on the market. This difficulty can be fixed by investing in a crypto index fund, which works similarly to an exchange-traded fund (ETF) like the S&amp;P 500. According to Morningstar Inc. data, the ETF industry&apos;s asset value reached $9 trillion in August 2021. These numbers will rise as more investors enter the market, and market participants who don&apos;t have the time to manage their portfolios or keep up with rapidly changing market circumstances will continue to favour ETFs. According to Coingecko, the crypto sector is currently a $1.98 trillion market, with just 231 million dollars of assets under various crypto indexes. A crypto index fund essentially assists you in investing in a basket of top cryptocurrencies while removing the burden of filtering and managing an ever-growing basket of cryptocurrencies. A crypto index fund also helps you diversify your money among a large number of assets, lowering your concentration risk.

The company, which overtook Binance as the world’s biggest bitcoin futures platform in October, plans to introduce the options on March 28 pending regulatory approval.  The contracts will be one-tenth of their respective underlying tokens in size, CME Group said in a statement Tuesday. They are set to add to CME’s suite of micro bitcoin and micro ether futures, launched last year.  The exchange introduced micro bitcoin futures in May 2021, adding the ether contracts in December.  ""At less than a year old, nearly 5.2 million combined Micro Bitcoin and Micro Ether futures contracts have changed hands,” Tim McCourt, global head of equity and FX Products at CME Group said in the statement. He noted that the “micro-sized options will enable traders of all sizes to efficiently hedge market-moving events with greater precision and flexibility or fine-tune their cryptocurrency market exposure.”  In February, CME reported fourth-quarter 2021 average daily volume of 20.5 million contracts, up 26% from fourth quarter 2020.  Options provide a trader with the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an asset at a specified price at any period during the life of the contract. Futures contracts give the buyer the obligation to purchase an asset at the specified date unless the position is closed beforehand.

It noted that it has a customized version of a driver and firmware that could bypass the limiter.  For its part, Nvidia said in an emailed statement to CoinDesk that it became aware of a cybersecurity incident on Feb. 23 that affected its IT resources. In response, it hardened its network, engaged cybersecurity incident response experts and notified law enforcement.  “We are aware that the threat actor took employee credentials and some Nvidia proprietary information from our systems and has begun leaking it online,” a representative from Nvidia said.  Nvidia is working to analyze the breached information and doesn’t expect any disruption to its business, the company said.  Last year, Nvidia introduced ""hashrate limiters"" for its flagship GeForce GPUs to keep more products available for its core gamers. In a recent Wall Street conference, the chipmaker said that almost all of its Ampere-based products will incorporate a hashrate limiter to deter crypto miners from using them for mining.  To further keep its product lines separate, Nvidia also introduced a crypto-specific mining chip last year, called Cryptocurrency Mining Processors (CMP).

42423741,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2f2Ph,1646146802,Electric Capital Raises $1B for 2 New Crypto VC Funds,"Crypto venture capital firm Electric Capital has entered the big leagues.  On Tuesday, the Bay Area investment firm announced a combined $1 billion raise for the creation of two new funds: a $400 million venture fund and a $600 million token fund.  It’s a step-up from the firm’s last fund, a $110 million vehicle announced in August 2020, and puts Electric in the conversation as one of crypto’s venture kingmakers – albeit with a different approach. Both Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) and Paradigm have all announced funds in the billions of dollars in recent months.  According to a press release provided to CoinDesk, the funds will have a wide-ranging focus on decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), layer 1s and blockchain infrastructure.  However, co-founders Curtis Spencer and Avichal Garg said in an interview that while the types of investments the funds will consider will be broad, they will specialize in projects with a strong community focus and fair launch token allocation.  “It used to be with token allocations it was very insider-heavy, and now we’re seeing the inverse of that – 60%-65% of token allocated to the community, which is how it should be,” said Garg. “People are playing with these token-economic incentives, where if you’re willing to do what’s right for the network – if you’re willing to be locked up for four years or something – you get disproportionate rewards. That presents an opportunity for long-term investors.”  VC pushback  Light vesting schedules and heavy venture capital allocations have long been a sticking point for retail investors, who argue that these bootstrapping strategies disadvantage average market participants – and that these ownership models are antithetical to blockchain’s open, permissionless ethos.  In Electric’s view, projects with more community ownership are also starting to look like superior investments.  “If you look at a lot of the emerging, healthy ecosystems, they’re not as VC-heavy,” said Spencer, pointing to Yearn Finance and Olympus as examples. “The fastest-growth ecosystems we see in the last 10-12 months, they’re community-heavy.”  Electric strives to own less than 10% of a project’s token supply at most, and tend to own “1%-5%” of the networks they invest in, according to Spencer.  Garg also noted that Electric frequently stakes and locks its assets, such as with its FRAX position, and they acquired a large portion of that investment on the open market.  Long horizons  In some ways, heavy community allocations and having to buy tokens on the market makes investing more difficult, but Garg believes that long-term investing in a nascent, high-growth industry still presents enormous upside.  “It’s going to come down to: How good of a picker are you? It’s still a venture, but the way you acquire the assets is going to be a little bit different. We think that’s the way the world’s going to work, and we can play in that market too,” he said.  Long-term thinking is also baked into the structure of the funds. Garg noted that the liquidity providers to the new ventures will be locked for 10-12 years. He also said that “roughly 90%” of the limited partners are nonprofits, foundations and university endowments – all parties known for long-term investments.  “Everybody needs to be long-term-minded here. This is a venture asset class – it’s going to take a long time to play out,” he said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | SPONSORED | YFI,Andrew Thurman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/03/01/electric-capital-raises-1b-for-2-new-crypto-vc-funds,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e0b8f942047527a656968e79d0bb7519effad354-2000x1305.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The arrangement is about bringing together Tetra’s regulated status with certain areas of Knox’s crypto custody expertise, such as its insurance cover – and is not an acquisition in the traditional sense, according to Knox CEO Alex Daskalov.  “While Tetra Trust is acquiring the many physical elements of our custodial stack to run under the Tetra Trust roof, this is not an acquisition of Knox itself, which will remain independent and focused on advancing institutional-grade custodial technology and insurance coverage,” Daskalov said via email.

Sign up here to get it in your inbox each weekday morning.  Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market Moves: Bitcoin extends Monday's rally even as traditional markets signal caution.  Featured stories: Analysts cite increased demand from Ukraine and Russia as catalyst behind bitcoin's bullish move.  And check out the CoinDesk TV show ""First Mover,"" hosted by Christine Lee, Emily Parker and Lawrence Lewitinn at 9 a.m. U.S. Eastern time. Today's show will feature guest:  Greg King, founder and CEO, Osprey Funds  Market Moves  By Omkar Godbole  Bitcoin (BTC) neared the $45,000 mark, extending Monday's gain despite risk aversion in traditional markets.  The futures tied to the S&P 500 slipped, the 10-year Treasury yield hit one-month lows and the yield on the 10-year German bund yield returned to negative territory after a month.  In currency markets, the safe-haven U.S. dollar and Japanese yen picked up a bid, while the growth-sensitive Aussie and Kiwi dollars erased early gains. Gold rose 0.5% and oil jumped 5% on both sides of the Atlantic.  The traditional market action signaled lingering anxiety and a sense of apprehension, given the Russia-Ukraine peace talks failed to achieve anything concrete yesterday and violence continued.  ""We may see another round in the days ahead. In the meantime, don't expect the hostilities in Kyiv to ease as the push and pull on the ground and sanctions continue,"" ForexLive's Justin Low said in a market update.

Almost the entire monthly gain stemmed from Monday's 14.5% surge, the most significant daily percentage rise since Feb. 8, 2021. Analysts cited a short squeeze and pick up in demand from Ukraine and Russia as catalysts fueling the move higher.  ""In percentage terms, bitcoin recorded the largest daily candle in more than a year, gaining more than 18% day-over-day at the highest point of the rally,"" Mikkel Morch, executive director at crypto hedge fund ARK36, said in an email. ""While it seems that the second leg of the move was at least partially fueled by a small short squeeze, overall, the rally was driven by a huge spike in demand.""  Trader and analyst Alex Kruger tweeted, ""Word on the street has been heavy bitcoin buying conducted by both Ukrainians and Russians. Mostly the latter. They have more money to protect.""  ""Bitcoin traded at a significant premium in ruble terms on Monday,"" Kuger told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat, adding that ""it's a matter of internal demand and capital controls/restricted access.""  On Monday, the Russian central bank raised borrowing costs from 9.5% to 20% and introduced some capital controls to arrest the ruble's slide, brought about by the West's punitive sanctions on Moscow. Per the Wall Street Journal, the Kremlin issued a decree, stating that foreign-exchange payments under loan agreements to non-resident Russians would be prohibited from March 1.  ""Capital controls without demand don't make an impact on price. Capital controls mean price will deviate to one side or the other depending or where the demand is,"" Kruger said while explaining the source of Russian premium.  Data tracked by Kaiko, a Paris-based cryptocurrency research provider, shows bitcoin traded at a 6% premium on dominant digital assets exchange Binance's Ukrainian hryvnia (UAH) market compared to bitcoin's price in the U.S. dollar market following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The premium perhaps stemmed from Ukrainians looking for alternatives amid disruptions in foreign exchange markets.

However, more than half of active vehicles in the region are inefficient 2-stroke petrol-powered motorcycles, primarily used in taxi and delivery services that drive hundreds of kilometers per day. The fuel they burn is costly for drivers and produces large quantities of toxic CO2 and fine particulate emissions. Recognizing the need for cheaper and more efficient transportation solutions, Bob Eco Ltd., a rapidly-growing electric vehicle and clean energy company, entered the African markets with a line of orange-clad electric two and three-wheelers designed for the needs of taxi and delivery drivers. Since the first one hit the road in October of 2020, Bob Eco&apos;s bikes create a total of 2.6 jobs per bike and save 5 tons of CO2 emissions from being released into the atmosphere every year. Able to save on fuel costs, drivers who switch to one of Bob Eco&apos;s vehicles nearly quadruple their take-home pay on average - enabling them to support their families and equip their homes with basic necessities like running water.

42420999,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXAqZJ,1646139600,They Were Jailed for Hacking an Exchange. Blockchain Data Cleared Them,"Cryptocurrency hacks usually make the news. So do arrests of alleged perpetrators. The recent seizure of around $3.6 billion worth of bitcoin along with the highly publicized arrest of two individuals tied to a 2016 attack on the crypto exchange Bitfinex by federal officials is but one example.  Crypto analytics played a key role in helping federal officials identify the alleged Bitfinex launderers. In another case, blockchain analysis may have helped clear the names of two suspects in an exchange hack.  In November 2020, two Venezuelan software developers, José Manuel Osorio Mendoza and Kelvin Jonathan Diaz, were detained by local authorities under suspicion of stealing around $1 million worth of bitcoin from a local cryptocurrency exchange called Bancar.  Mendoza and Diaz maintained their innocence but remained doubtful they would be able to prove that in court.  “There is a lot of technological ignorance in my country, despite being an economy open to crypto … Even though we worked at a technology enterprise, we felt this doubt about how we could explain something that was so new and so difficult to understand” to a local judge, Mendoza said.  At the time of their detainment, Mendoza and Diaz worked at POSINT, a Venezuelan software development company that had previously provided services to Bancar. Eager to clear his company’s and colleagues’ names, Danny Penagos, chief operations officer at POSINT, hired blockchain analytics company CipherBlade to independently investigate the attack on Bancar.  CipherBlade’s resulting report, reviewed by CoinDesk, tells a complex story of security vulnerabilities and scapegoating while tracking the stolen funds from Bancar through recently blacklisted Suex.io all the way to Russia. The report shows that the stolen bitcoin eventually ended up on leading digital asset exchange Binance.  The Venezuelan court agreed to take a look at CipherBlade’s report. Based on the investigation’s findings, in January 2021, over a month after the developer duo were detained, the court granted Mendoza and Diaz conditional freedom. In August 2021, the court officially dismissed all charges against them, according to an official document obtained by CoinDesk.  While illicit crypto transaction volumes fell by more than half from 2019 to 2020, it’s still a multibillion-dollar market. And the demand for blockchain intelligence services to track illicit transactions is booming. Blockchain intelligence firm Chainalysis has multimillion-dollar contracts with the U.S. government, and last September, global payments giant Mastercard agreed to buy CipherTrace, a firm that scans blockchains for illicit activity.  Read more: US Officials Seize $3.6B in Bitcoin From 2016 Bitfinex Hack  Miguel Alonso Torres, a senior investigator at CipherBlade (not to be confused with the Mastercard acquisition), said his firm works on a range of cases from hacks and theft to the occasional divorce case where a spouse was suspected of not disclosing their total crypto holdings.  But clearing two suspects was a first for Torres.  “Having someone in prison and being asked to investigate a hack just to be able to prove to the court that they were in fact innocent, that’s absolutely unique. I never had a case like this one,” said Torres.  The exchange hack  It all started when Bancar hired POSINT in 2018 to help build its cryptocurrency exchange.  In 2018, Venezuela’s president, Nicolas Maduro, launched the petro, the country’s controversial government-issued digital currency backed by a portion of Venezuela's oil reserves. His aggressive tactics to force the petro’s adoption ranged from ordering a number of state-owned companies to convert a part of their sales to petro to reportedly requiring citizens to pay for new passports with petro.  In October 2018, local media outlets began to report that Maduro had approved six local cryptocurrency exchanges to sell petro. According to the reports, Bancar was one of the six exchanges approved by Maduro. Penagos said that following Bancar’s approval, POSINT was hired to build out the firm’s trading platform. He added that after completing the work, POSINT handed the source code over to Bancar.  Bancar didn't respond to multiple requests for comment.  A year later, 103.99 BTC worth around $1 million disappeared from the Bancar exchange in a cyberattack, according to the CipherBlade report. The bitcoin was stolen in five separate transactions that occurred on two different days – three transactions on Sept. 4, 2019, and the rest on Sept. 7, 2019.  According to Penagos, Bancar immediately suspected POSINT, the company that had built the software Bancar was using, of the theft. Penagos, meanwhile, ran a simple trace and found the stolen bitcoin had ended up on Binance.  “I think a professional attacker or hacker would not deposit that amount of money in a big exchange like Binance,” Penagos said.  Penagos says he notified Bancar by email and asked it to consider hiring CipherBlade to investigate the hack or contact Binance to try to recover the funds.  Read more: Crypto Analytics Tools 'Wave of the Future, Dude,' Judge Quotes Cult Film in $3.6B Bitcoin Seizure Case  Then, a year later, in December 2020, local media reported that Venezuelan authorities had detained Mendoza and Diaz as the suspects behind the attack. At the time, Mendoza was the chief technology officer at POSINT and Diaz was a senior developer at the company, Penagos said.  “We were confused,” Diaz said, recalling the first days he was detained.  Local news outlets and international crypto news sites published stories on their detainment.  “After circumventing the platform's security, [Mendoza and Diaz] allegedly proceeded to make bitcoin and fiat transfers to various accounts associated with them,” crypto news platform Decrypt wrote.  Meanwhile, Mendoza and Diaz weren't sure how to prove their innocence.  “While we were detained, doubts kept increasing,” Mendoza said.  All POSINT had to do was prove the two couldn't have stolen the funds, but that wasn’t easy.  “Cryptocurrency is uniquely transparent as all transactions are recorded on a public, immutable, permanent blockchain ledger,"" Gurvais Grigg, global public sector chief technology officer at Chainalysis, said in an email. ""The challenge is that the blockchain is not human-readable. It’s difficult to know what services are behind transactions on the blockchain because they are pseudonymous.""  After his colleagues were detained, Penagos said he tried to contact Binance himself but received no reply. Failing that, he finally turned to CipherBlade.  “When the investigation started, we finally started to feel relaxed,” Mendoza said.  Tracking the flow of funds  Within a month of starting its investigation, CipherBlade was able to map out the trajectory of the stolen Bancar funds in considerable detail.  “When you look at the flow of funds, you know there were some obfuscation techniques that weren't executed particularly well,” said Paul Sibenik, lead case manager at CipherBlade.  Once the 103.99 BTC were lifted from the exchange in five separate transactions, the perpetrator deposited the stolen bitcoin to two addresses, or virtual locations denoted by a string of numbers and letters where the bitcoin can be sent.  Then, the stolen bitcoin eventually converged to an address on Binance: 1ECeZBxCVJ8Wm2JSN3Cyc6rge2gnvD3W5K.  But something wasn’t adding up.  “We initially saw all funds go to Binance,"" Sibenik said. ""But we could tell that the address that the funds went to was not a personal account at Binance that belonged to the hacker. It was some type of service.""  According to the CipherBlade report, Binance informed investigators that the address was associated with Suex.io, a Moscow-based firm that offered over-the-counter (OTC) trading services.  That meant that Bancar’s stolen bitcoin first ended up in two addresses belonging to the perpetrator, and the perpetrator then used Suex.io to convert the bitcoin to another asset. In other words, the perpetrator used Suex.io’s OTC service to launder the stolen bitcoin. Suex.io then sent the stolen bitcoin to its account at Binance.  CipherBlade tried to request information from Suex.io but Sibenik and Torres said the Russian firm wasn't cooperative.  “The first thing is that anyone that was a potential client of Suex.io at the time knew that they didn’t have requirements at all,"" Torres said. ""They didn’t care who they were dealing with or where the funds came from. I respect pseudonymity and privacy a lot but there are also ethical values. This case was critical. There were two people in prison.”  According to the report, Binance helped CipherBlade fill in the blanks by making a source-of-funds request to Suex.io. A crypto exchange can make such a request to clients asking them to explain the origin of the money or assets deposited on the platform.  The information eventually shared by Suex.io allowed CipherBlade to retrieve everything from the perpetrator’s internet protocol (IP) address to their Telegram handle, internet service provider and web browser. All information pointed to a Russian national.  “It became evident to us that, indeed, Mendoza and Diaz were just being scapegoated,” Sibenik said.  Meanwhile, in September 2021, Suex.io became the first cryptocurrency exchange to be sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), placing it in the same category as terrorists and drug traffickers. Interestingly, the Suex.io address on the Binance platform was one of the digital currency addresses flagged on OFAC’s sanctions list. Suex.io didn't respond to multiple requests for comment.  Read More: Here’s What We Know About Suex, the First Crypto Firm Sanctioned by US  Binance confirmed to CoinDesk that it participated in CipherBlade’s investigation and that it had de-platformed the account in question based on internal safeguards. However, it didn't specify when the account was de-platformed.  “Similarly to banks and other traditional financial institutions, whenever any illicit flows come through exchanges, the exchange itself is not harboring the actual criminal groups, but rather is being exploited as a middleman,” a Binance spokesperson said in an emailed statement.  Exchange vulnerabilities  CipherBlade’s report also looked into Bancar and found a number of vulnerabilities that may have exposed the platform to attack.  For one, the CipherBlade investigation found that there are more than 7,000 spam web pages on ""​http://bancarexchange.io​"" that weren't created by Bancar. The CipherBlade report said (and CoinDesk confirmed) that a simple search for the website returns pages advertising everything from Russian brides to car rentals to ghostwriting.  During its investigation, CipherBlade also found the platform’s SSL certificate, which authenticates the website’s identity, had been correctly installed but revoked in December 2020, a year after the hack. A certification can be revoked for a number of reasons, including signs its private keys have been compromised.  Read More: 'Frozen' Bitcoin Tied to Canadian Protests Lands at Coinbase, Crypto.Com  At the end of the report, the intelligence firm also outlines potential steps Venezuelan authorities could take to follow the culprit and close the case. It is unclear whether Venezuelan authorities are pursuing the individual in question. But CipherBlade is hopeful.  “I was not super-optimistic at first that the authorities would take our opinions into account.

Named EktaChain, the mainnet leverages the power of blockchain in its tokenization of real-world assets. Hence, EktaChain facilitates the representation of physical assets and their real-world value as virtual analogs. In its operation, Ekta aims to offer users a platform to build a profitable and robust portfolio of real-world assets, but on-chain, and for all budgets and types of investors.

If over the weekend Bitcoin was moving rather sluggishly and hinted at the possibility of updating the local low from 24 February, then on 1 March the situation is completely different. In our previous article, we wrote that we expect the price to grow to $46,000. Buyers have one step left to implement this scenario. However, there will be a serious struggle near the $46,000 mark, which will determine the next medium-term movement of the BTC price. The fact is that now the BTC price is moving in the consolidation channel. This movement is more like a global consolidation during the reversal. The unsuccessful attempt of sellers to update the local low from 24 January on a weekly timeframe gave buyers hope for growth with the final target of $56,000-$57,000. https://www.tradingview.com/x/dkNWwhiI/ At the moment, the main question is whether buyers will be able to make this growth without the BTC correction from the range of $46,000. In case of trading volumes in this range and decrease in price volatility - we will expect a local correction of the BTC price to $40,800-$41,400. If the trend of buyers is really strong, then below this range the price should not fall.

42423755,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2f2th,1646134709,"S&P 500 Conflict History Points to Short-Term Bitcoin Bounce, Sell-Off in H2: QCP","Bitcoin (BTC) bulls betting on a prolonged rally are likely to be disappointed, if previous wars' impact on the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index is any guide, according to QCP Capital.  A study published by the Singapore-based crypto trading firm shows that in four of the previous five wars involving a superpower, the S&P 500, Wall Street's benchmark equity index, dropped on early headlines anticipating a military conflict only to chalk up lasting rallies in the months following the outbreak of hostilities.  The exception was during the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan. Then the S&P 500's post-invasion rally peaked within three months and resumed a decline related to the dot-com bust before setting new bear market lows. QCP expects risk assets to chart similar moves this time, saying the macroeconomic conditions today are similar those of 21 years ago.  ""Given the historical pattern, we expect global markets to remain supported in the near term,"" it wrote in a research note published on Monday. ""With that said, we remain very cautious in light of the prevailing macroeconomic headwinds.  ""The closest parallel to the present situation is the 2001 Afghan war given the similarities: 1. Markets were under pressure from the dot-com deleveraging. 2. Impending stagflation with inflation at a then decade-high level of 3.5%,"" QCP said. ""In the Afghan war, markets saw a relief rally that lasted three months before resuming the downtrend and eventually breaking below the post-invasion lows.""  While many in the crypto community consider bitcoin a digital equivalent to gold, historical data shows it is a risk asset. The cryptocurrency's 60-day correlation with the S&P 500 increased last week to a record high.  Since mid-November, markets mostly have been on the defensive, predominantly due to concerns the U.S. Federal Reserve would close the liquidity tap sooner than anticipated to contain inflation. Bitcoin was already down over 35% from the record high of $69,000 reached on Nov. 10 when Russia-Ukraine tensions began escalating two weeks ago.  With the West imposing stricter punitive sanctions on Moscow over the weekend, analysts are worried that Russia's exports of all commodities, including oil, metals and wheat, will take a hit, pushing the global economy into stagflation – a combination of low or stagnant growth and high inflation.  That may put even more pressure on the Fed and other central banks to withdraw liquidity. The Fed is expected to raise borrowing costs by 25 basis points this month and deliver at least five more quarter-percentage-point hikes by year-end. Goldman Sachs foresees the Fed raising rates four times next year, as mentioned in Monday's First Mover Americas.  ""One critical difference between the Afghan war and the current war is that interest rates were at 6.5% back then. This gave Alan Greenspan's Fed a lot of room to ease rates all the way down to 1%,"" QCP said. ""This time, markets are under similar pressure, but the Fed has run out of easing options. Interest rates can only go higher and the Fed balance sheet can only shrink from here.""  Thus, the odds appear stacked against bitcoin and S&P 500 charting lasting gains in coming months. ""If markets follow the same pattern as the Afghan war, any relief rally in the next few weeks or months will be a good opportunity to square up longs and initiate downside hedges,"" QCP Capital noted.  Bitcoin was trading near $43,600 at press time, having printed one-month lows under $34,500 last Thursday, after Russia invaded Ukraine. The S&P 500 has bounced to 4,373 from Thursday's nine-month low of 4,114, according to chart platform TradingView.  The equity index saw a prolonged bull run following the beginning of the Vietnam war (1964), Gulf war (1991), Iraq war (2003) and Crimean crisis (2014).",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/03/01/sp-500-conflict-history-points-to-short-term-bitcoin-bounce-sell-off-in-h2-qcp,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/22b4841e36cad2aadb6c738e5ab50f48ccd202e3-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The club has rejected offers to be associated with crypto enterprises because it wishes to develop its own cryptocurrency and its own metaverse, Joan Laporta said at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona this week.  ""We want to create our own cryptocurrency and we have to do that ourselves,"" Laporta said. ""We are different because we survive financially from what we can generate through the industry of sport.""  Unlike the majority of major soccer clubs, Barcelona is owned and operated by its fans. Governance of the club is built around 160,000 members rather than shareholders. It was the world's most valuable soccer club in 2021, according to Forbes.  ""We do not have big corporations or shareholders behind us. That forces us to be imaginative, innovative, brave and be a step ahead in many areas that surround the sports industry,"" Laporta said.  Laporta said the club will launch a range of non-fungible tokens (NFT) in the near future, following plans initially announced in November.  It is unclear at this point what Barcelona's crypto would be used for, whether it be a form of fan token akin to those offered by Socios or a means of payment for tickets and merchandise.

Let&apos;s take a close look at the top four NFT platforms fronting the way: Centaurify, MusicArt, and Meteora. Centaurify Centaurify is a music NFT universe that helps music lovers connect with their favorite musicians on a new level, through NFT ticketing, live events, and official merchandise. Centaurify aims to revolutionize the music industry by taking control from scalpers, while giving it back to artists through the power of blockchain technology. Today, scalped tickets go for massively inflated prices, with very little of their original sale going to performers. With the live event market expected to 10x by 2025, a massive amount of resources are being stolen from those who really deserve them. Centaurify is fighting back with tokenized tickets that are specially developed to prevent scalping by providing full transparency, thus empowering artists. Another hugely important element is the official merchandise musicians produce, an essential component of artist-fan relationship building. While fans are able to collect cool mementos of concerts they attended or artists they support, musicians gain another revenue stream that allows them to continue producing their art.

Bitcoin (BTC) was hovering over $43,000 early on Tuesday, compared to $38,000 24 hours earlier. Ether (ETH) was selling over the $2,900 mark, compared with $2,600 Monday. Bitcoin has been outperforming gold in this crisis.  Peace talks between Russia and Ukraine held in Minsk last night haven't led to any publicly known conclusions, other than to meet again. The U.S. closed down its embassy in Minsk yesterday and green-lighted the partial evacuation of staff from its Moscow mission. Earlier, Belarussian politicians voted to end the country's non-nuclear status, likely to allow Russia to place nuclear weapons on its soil.  Intense fighting continued overnight in Ukrainian cities, including the capital of Kyiv. A Russian military convoy 65 kilometers in length was seen driving toward the capital early on Tuesday.  The Indian embassy in Kyiv advised all Indian nationals to leave the city ""urgently today."" Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will ask the Air Force to support the evacuation, NDTV reported, citing sources familiar with the matter.  Western countries have stepped up their support of Ukraine's defense; the U.S. allocated $350 million for Ukraine's defense spending, while the U.K., France, Germany, Canada, Sweden, Belgium, the Netherlands, Portugal, Greece, the Czech Republic, Romania and Spain have agreed to send ammunitions or defensive equipment.  Mastercard has blocked ""multiple"" financial institutions from its payments network due to sanctions orders, the company said in a Tuesday statement posted on its site.  Sanctions levied on Russian entities in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine include President Vladimir Putin, the central bank's international reserves and a swath of banks, energy exporters and airlines.  Russia calls the invasion a ""special military operation"" and claims to be ""denazifying"" Ukraine.  The European Union, U.S., U.K. and Canada have announced they will cut some Russian banks out of the SWIFT payments network.  Meanwhile, the Ukrainian Ministry of Finance is selling war bonds to fund the military effort. Authorities have also called on the world to donate in bitcoin, ether, U.S. stablecoin tether and polkadot.  Binance founder and CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao tweeted that ""it often takes a week for 'the market' to understand,"" likely implying the market rally could be reversed.

42423737,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2f2Hh,1646127324,Ukraine Lawyer Says Country Has Received Numerous Russian Wallet Addresses for Crypto 'Blacklist',"Ukraine has received tons of crypto wallet addresses connected to Russian politicians after the nation mounted an effort to find and blacklist such wallets, said Artem Afian, the private lawyer entrusted with the responsibility.  “Our idea was that the war criminals will try to avoid sanction through crypto and we want to get them there,” said Afian.  The de facto head of crypto matters in the Ukraine, Mykhailo Fedorov, asked for this information on Saturday. Fedorov, the deputy prime minister and minister of digital transformation, tweeted a clarion call for information on crypto wallets held by Russian and Belarusian politicians.  'Blacklist' efforts in full steam  Speaking to CoinDesk from an undisclosed location, Afian said he is fighting the crypto part of the war for Ukraine while worrying about his safety and the safety of his parents. “It’s not aggression. It’s a war with real bombs. It’s crazy. My parents are alive but I don’t know if they are safe,” he said.  At the moment, Afian’s team has only identified a few prominent names but he hopes that after double-checking all the wallets there will be plenty more. Afian’s team is coordinating with the Ministry of Digital Transformation, a familiar wing of the government for Afian, who was part of the working group that developed the law on virtual assets in Ukraine.  An integral part of preparing the blacklist is to “help all crypto exchanges in the world tag these politicians, their families, partners, children.” He intends to convince the exchanges to “stop working with the politicians, to squeeze them out of the crypto world.”  Ukraine has also asked several crypto exchanges to block Russian user accounts to make sure sanctions placed on Russia are effectively implemented.  Afian added that he has been getting ""threats from them,"" but is ""happy to read” those threats because it makes him believe he is “doing the right thing.”  There are loopholes to this strategy because Russian and Belarusian politicians could use cold wallets, meaning a wallet not connected to the internet. However, Afian wants the crypto exchanges to make it “toxic” for these politicians and to let them know that “sooner or later we will get them.”  “For me it is personal. My four-year-old son woke up because of bombs. I can never forgive this. [Russia] voted for war. I cannot make them suffer directly but I do what I can to punish them,” he said.  'Bounty' will depend on the remaining war funds  The deputy prime minister had also promised a bounty for information on the wallets. Afian said the exact amount will depend on a number of factors. “It depends, [because] a majority of our funds could go towards the military resistance. But it could be five or 10 bitcoins or more,” he added.  According to Afian, this is a watershed moment for decentralized finance (DeFi), or the process of conducting financial transactions on a blockchain without middlemen.  “If the crypto world can show that without centralization it can stand against crime, then people will trust crypto. If the crypto world fails Ukraine, there may not be any future for crypto.”  Read more: Ukraine Government Is Using Crypto Aid to Purchase Critical Supplies",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | REGULATION,Amitoj Singh,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/03/01/ukraine-lawyer-says-they-have-received-numerous-russian-wallet-addresses-for-crypto-blacklist,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

42423756,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2f2rh,1646127072,One THETA Trader Lost $11M to Liquidations as Prices Jumped 18%,"A lone trader lost more than $11 million on a single futures trade involving Theta Networks’ THETA token as the price jumped 18% in 24 hours.  The trade, among the largest for mid-cap cryptos in recent months, occurred on crypto exchange Binance and formed the largest part of the $11.67 million in liquidations on THETA futures. Usually, the largest liquidations occur on futures tracking bitcoin (BTC) or ether (ETH), the two most-traded cryptocurrencies.  Liquidations occur when a trader has insufficient funds to fill a margin call – a demand for extra collateral by the exchange to keep the trading position funded. They’re especially common in high-risk trading due to the volatility of assets.  Of the $11.67 million in liquidation losses to THETA futures traders, one person was short $11.08 million of THETA, meaning that person was betting the token's price would drop, data from analytics service Coinglass show. The position was liquidated as prices jumped 18% from Monday’s lows of $2.73.  Binance, the largest crypto exchange, alone saw $11.54 million worth of shorts placed on THETA futures. Rival exchange OKX had $53,000 worth.  THETA hit resistance near the $3.50 level and tumbled 30 cents at the time of writing. It could fall to the $2.90 level if the selling pressure continues.  The THETA token forms the backbone of decentralized video-streaming service Theta Network and can be staked by those wishing to become “Validator” or “Guardian” nodes to earn returns. THETA allows nodes to validate transactions, produce blocks, vote on changes to the network and earn TFUEL as a reward, according to the technical documents.  THETA rose to $3.39 in early Asian hours amid a broader revival in the crypto market. Bitcoin rallied through $44,000, while ETH, Terra’s LUNA, and other major cryptocurrencies have all posted gains in excess of 10% in the past 24 hours.  At the time of writing, THETA is the 45th-largest cryptocurrency and has a market capitalization of $3.2 billion.

BitConnect founder Satish Kumbhani is nowhere to be found a week after being indicted in the $2.4 billion Ponzi scheme that is said to have defrauded investors in the U.S.  Kumbhani, an Indian citizen, was charged criminally by the U.S. Department of Justice last week. The Securities and Exchange Commission separately sued Kumbhani in September 2021, claiming he fraudulently raised more than $2 billion for BitConnect.  The problem now? No one knows where Kumbhani is.  Officials said in a legal filing on Monday that Kumbhani has likely vanished from India and his whereabouts remain unknown. This follows from an October 2021 filing that said the SEC learned Kumbhani has likely relocated from India to an unknown address in a different country.  “The Commission did not know the whereabouts of Kumbhani, an Indian citizen, at the time it filed this action, and BitConnect is an unincorporated entity the Commission must serve through its manager, Kumbhani,” said senior trial counsel Richard G. Primoff in the filing.  “Since November, the Commission has been consulting with that country’s financial regulatory authorities in an attempt to locate Kumbhani’s address,” Primoff added. “At present, however, Kumbhani’s location remains unknown, and the Commission remains unable to state when its efforts to locate him will be successful, if at all.”  Primoff has asked U.S. District Judge John Koeltl for an extension until May 30.  BitConnect, founded in 2016, was one of the biggest and most popular projects in the initial coin offering (ICO) rage in mid-2017, raising billions of dollars from global investors for a protocol that purportedly paid out 10% in interest earnings via its BCC token to investors, with users who “referred” other investors getting even more benefits.  But BitConnect – which was increasingly facing scrutiny from lawmakers and investors for its product – saw platform administrators closing the earning platform on Jan. 16, 2018. Prices of BCC plummeted to below $1 from a previous high of nearly $500 in a few days after the platform’s closure.  Such conditions kick-started a court battle in the U.S. to bring to justice the founders of BitConnect, with Kumbhani and American citizen Glenn Arcaro at the center of the scheme. Arcaro pleaded guilty to criminal charges on Sept. 1, 2021, with charges including conspiracy to commit wire fraud and criminal forfeiture.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/03/01/bitconnect-founder-indicted-in-24b-ponzi-scheme-has-disappeared,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a7892eb39c7acac7bf75e79b2fdcb529ff90ecc8-3456x2304.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394277,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvbCU5,1646120816,Why Crypto Terminology Is Outdated,"Crypto had a breakthrough 2021, and 2022 is looking equally promising.  Prices soared and public awareness of its enormous potential widened. Digital assets are now prominent on the radars of major financial institutions and regulators.  Duncan Trenholme is co-head of digital assets at TP ICAP. TP ICAP operates in the global wholesale over-the-counter and exchange-traded markets.  But as the asset class, which at one point topped $3 trillion in market capitalization, matures, the industry faces a reckoning with terminology that is ill-fitting for services that have evolved beyond those describing traditional financial systems.  This disconnect is detrimental for crypto’s continued development by confusing retail and institutional investors looking for clear explanations. If people are comfortable with the language of the fledgling industry, they are more likely to become participants in it. Pinpoint definitions also allow regulators to make decisions more quickly.  Yet, clarity, based on a crypto lingua franca, could do much to accelerate regulatory guidance and ensure widespread crypto adoption among investors who are not yet comfortable acquiring crypto or even investing in companies that provide services for it.  Crypto exchanges  For example, many cryptocurrency exchanges have added additional services that mean they now more closely resemble a broker-dealer or a bank than a traditional exchange. This is an important distinction.  Beyond the listing and trading services, exchanges now safekeep assets, handle client funds, act as a counterparty to trades, have their own proprietary over-the-counter (OTC) trading desk and even occasionally lend and borrow against clients' collateral.  ""Exchange"" may often be the wrong term for this type of firm. What’s the alternative? Perhaps a hybrid encompassing the main services of these companies would be more descriptive and consumer friendly.  Cryptocurrency  Even using the term ""cryptocurrency"" to describe the assets themselves is misleading because it fundamentally confuses the role of many tokens within their native networks and beyond. The majority of digital assets are not currencies.  Some tokens play roles more similar to equities, representing a share of ownership. Some exist purely for liquidity provision and some act as bearer/receipt tokens on staked collateral. Tokens and digital assets have many other uses as they touch a widening number of industries. To bundle them under the term “cryptocurrency” is misleading.  Courts will ultimately decide what rights and ownership tokens give to their holders. Perhaps industry leaders can settle on a lexicon that accounts for the distinctions of different tokens and, with time, would find widespread adoption.  Blockchain  Even the definition of the term ""blockchain"" is evolving. It once described an innovative technology whose practical value was difficult to define. But with the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) projects, many of them funded in the millions by a now-rapt venture capital audience, it suggests a more varied, larger-scale phenomenon.  Blockchain projects now encompass DeFi, GameFi and the rapidly evolving metaverse. A world based partly or entirely on the smart contracts of Web 3 now seems achievable. Who could have imagined this development just a few years ago? Does blockchain now sufficiently describe this bounty of different uses?  Who has authority?  Perhaps most importantly, the shortcomings of current terminology are preventing regulators from reaching a consensus on categorizing tokens as securities, commodities or other financial instruments. Such clarity would enable agencies to determine which of them has authority over these assets. This task is already difficult because DeFi and other Web 3 platforms operate outside the perimeter of traditional finance.  As institutional interest grows in digital assets, a strong regulatory framework will be essential, but this can only occur when the nomenclature is precise.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING,Duncan Trenholme,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/03/01/why-crypto-terminology-is-outdated,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7bfe28c7dc7947ac2631926f80b903c50cbba321-508x338.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42416609,e264UAkMOkEShzxWulVoXM,1646114632,Terra’s LUNA Jumps 24% as Bitcoin Breaks $44K,"Terra’s LUNA token jumped 24% in the past 24 hours to lead gains among major cryptocurrencies in a broader market recovery.  LUNA reached weekly highs of $95.36 in early Asian hours before traders took profits and sent prices down by some $6. At the time of writing, the token was trading at $88, up from $50 last Thursday night, with nearly $3.9 billion worth of the tokens traded on various crypto exchanges in the past 24 hours.  The move came days after a similar 25% spike in the token on Friday. However, prices are down 13% from December's lifetime high of $103.  RSI, or relative strength index, readings hovered at the 71 level at the time of writing, suggesting further downside to the $86 level, where local support exists. RSI is a price-chart tool that calculates the magnitude of price changes. Readings above 70 show an asset is “overbought” and could see a correction, while under 30 suggest an asset is “oversold” and could see a price increase.  Some crypto market observers said LUNA’s strong fundamentals provide some of the buying pressure.  “LUNA outpacing its peers in the market today should not come as a shock,” said Alexander Mamasidikov, co-founder of mobile digital bank MinePlex, in an email to CoinDesk. “The coin is backed by a blockchain protocol that is inherently innovative and has the potential for massive utility and scalability, a feature both retail and institutional investors realize.”  Bitcoin (BTC) traded above $44,000 after falling to as low as $34,550 last week. Analysts suggested the recovery came as Russia’s war against Ukraine bolstered retail demand for cryptocurrencies.  Cryptocurrencies regained the $2 trillion market capitalization level on Thursday after gaining 11% in the market recovery, data from CoinGecko showed. The markets have added over $500 billion since last week’s lows of $1.5 trillion.
