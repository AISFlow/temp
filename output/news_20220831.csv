On Wednesday, the U.S. board described its criteria for crypto assets that would be covered by a long-awaited rule for companies to account for and disclose their holdings of digital assets.  FASB did not name specific crypto assets that would be excluded from the rule. But it said the digital assets addressed by the rule would include those that are intangible, don’t carry contractual rights to cash flows or ownership of goods and services, and those that are fungible, according to the Journal. NFTs are by their very nature non-fungible and may carry rights to underlying assets, while some stablecoins are tangible assets.  FASB board member Susan Cosper told the Journal that not many companies had invested in NFTs yet. “It’s not pervasive or material at this juncture,"" she said, adding that “it’s certainly something that we can focus on later if need be.”  FASB did not discuss reporting standards for companies holding cryptocurrencies like bitcoin (BTC) on their balance sheets. At present, companies must record an unrealized loss if the value of their holdings drop, even if the companies don't sell the assets. But they do not have to report unrealized gains. Similar rules don't exist for companies holding other assets. The crypto industry is hoping FASB will update its recommendations to address this disparity.

Bitcoin rose 2% on the day, surpassing volume from the prior day and settling above $20,000. The largest cryptocurrency by market cap recovered part of its losses from Monday, but remains 11% below its 50-day exponential moving average (EMA).  Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, traded in concert with BTC, rising 3% on average trading volume when compared with its 20-day moving average. ETH’s price is 5% below its 50-day EMA.  This article originally appeared in Market Wrap, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Global Macro: The macroeconomic calendar was busy, but didn’t appear to have a big effect on cryptocurrency prices. Germany’s unemployment rate of 2.9% matched estimates, while July import prices increased by 28.9%, slightly below expectations.  The U.S. weekly petroleum status report showed declines of 3.3 million barrels of oil, compared with the expected decrease of 1.48 million barrels.  ADP employment data showed that private businesses hired 132,000 new employees in August, which was 50% below July’s figure and 60% below the average of the prior three months.  August’s number was the smallest gain since January 2021, indicating that the Federal Reserve’s policy of increased rates may be having a cooling effect on the economy.  Altcoins traded higher on Wednesday, with polkadot (DOT) increasing 0.55%, Polygon’s MATIC token up 3% and AVAX up 0.25%.  U.S. Equities: The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite all traded down slightly on Wednesday, at least partly because of the tepid ADP jobs figure. The DJIA, Nasdaq and S&P 500 fell 0.9%, 0.6% and 0.8% respectively.  Commodities: Despite the larger-than-expected decline in inventories, crude oil prices fell 3% on Wednesday, while natural gas rose by 1.2%. Copper futures dropped for a third consecutive day, falling 1%, while the price of gold declined 0.9%.

Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Technical Take  Bitcoin Bears in Control, but Uncertainty Remains  Bitcoin traded 1.34% higher on Tuesday, but both technical and on-chain analytics imply uncertainty. BTC’s daily candle indicated an “inside day,” where the trading range is smaller than it was the day before.  An inside day can indicate lower price volatility as well as a lack of conviction among traders. The price range consolidation can also signal that prices are set to break out from their current trading range.  On-chain data shows that BTC funding rates remain negative, indicating that bearish investors are paying bullish traders for the right to be short BTC. Funding rates have been negative for 11 out of the last 12 days, signaling that bearish sentiment is dominant at the moment.  Glassnode’s MVRV Z-Score is an on-chain tool that measures an asset’s “fair value” to assess if the asset is overvalued (above 6.9) or undervalued (below 0.1).  BTC’s current Z-Score is -0.13, implying that prices are undervalued. Historically, BTC prices have moved higher following a negative score, but traders should be cautious to trade based on this metric alone.  Technical data shows that BTC is trading 5% below its ""point-of-control"" price of $21,132, dating to January. Point of control represents a “high volume node,” and is identified using the “volume profile visible range (VPVR) tool. The tool displays trading activity across price levels over time.  Point of control also represents a price level with substantial activity and agreement on price. It highlights areas of support or resistance.  In concert with an RSI (relative strength index) reading of 35 (above the overbought level of 30), traders may be expecting BTC to trade relatively flat in the near term, as BTC appears to be neither overbought nor oversold at the moment, with single-digit upside to its point of control.  Chartists are also likely interpreting conflicting signals. Bullish traders are likely viewing current prices’ proximity to the double-bottom formation that occurred in July, and in turn expecting a bounce higher. Bearish traders are potentially viewing the identical chart formation as a “head-and-shoulders"" pattern, set to trade below $20,000 as its 10-period EMA continues to trend negative.

Despite being legal in a growing number of states for either medical or recreational use, cannabis is still illegal under federal law. The resulting regulatory uncertainty has effectively locked the industry out of the traditional financial system. Dispensaries and other cannabis companies have largely been shunned by federal banks and credit card networks, forcing them to hoard cash on-site – a practice that has made them a growing target for violent robberies – or pay exorbitant fees to bank at state-chartered institutions.  This feature is part of CoinDesk's Sin Week.  To many, crypto seems like the natural solution. Cannabis companies could, in theory, bypass the legacy financial system by accepting crypto payments and storing the money in crypto wallets rather than store stacks of cash (although that would likely attract a different sort of thief).  But theory doesn’t always match reality.  Crypto’s inherent volatility and high transaction costs make it a poor substitute for cash, dissuading many potential cannabis business owners from going through the trouble of setting up a digital wallet and learning how to accept crypto payments. Those who forge ahead aren't immune to censorship: In 2018, Coinbase shut down a Washington-based medical marijuana dispensary’s account, citing federal regulations. Coinbase didn't return a request for comment on whether its policy has changed since that time.  And even if crypto could solve the cannabis industry’s banking woes, there are a host of other issues it can’t fix (legally, at least), including high taxes, slim profit margins and black market competition.  Though crypto is certainly no cure-all, many in the cannabis industry have found it to be a useful tool.  Culture match  The cannabis industry and the crypto sector first shook hands in the Silk Road, the modern darknet founded by “Dread Pirate Roberts” or Ross Ulbricht. Before being shut down by the FBI in 2013, the Silk Road allowed people to use bitcoin to buy and sell marijuana, which was at the time criminalized in many states.  It has been almost a decade since Ulbricht was apprehended and the Silk Road shut down, and during that time, the cannabis industry and the Web3 sector have made significant strides in becoming more normalized.  The 2018 Farm Bill removed hemp from the definition of marijuana in the Controlled Substances Act, and several states have legalized cannabis. In 2021, Colorado collected more than $423 million in tax revenue from marijuana sales, compared with $387 million the prior year.  Additionally, last month, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Democratic Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Ron Wyden of Oregon introduced the Cannabis Administration & Opportunity Act, which would remove cannabis from the Controlled Substances Act, expunge any arrests and convictions for a nonviolent federal cannabis offenses as well as impose an excise tax on cannabis products.  Crypto growth  On the crypto side, the overall market capitalization has grown to $1 trillion at the time of this writing from $10 billion at the end of 2013. The days when crypto wasn't on the radar of national governments are long over as heads of states are sanctioning protocols and formulating their own strategy to launch their own digital currencies.  The dramatic changes that have normalized both industries have shifted the crypto-cannabis culture since the Silk Road days.  Take, for example, Crypto Cannabis Club, “a social club for cannabis consumers that basically uses NFTs as the membership card,” CEO Ryan Hunter said, referring to non-fungible tokens.  Hunter, who once built a 10-acre cannabis farm, indicated that the vision for the Crypto Cannabis Club was to create a community that covers both virtual and real-life experiences.  For instance, on the digital side, the cannabis NFT social club has a virtual dispensary in the Voxels metaverse, and on the real-world side of the ledger, Crypto Cannabis Club has formed partnerships with more than 30 different cannabis products and accessory providers to establish a utility program that offers discounts to their community members.  Read more: Jeff Wilser - Drugs, Drugs and More Drugs: Crypto on the Dark Web  Cory Mitchell, the operations manager at Flower Power Botanicals, a dispensary in Fort Collins, Colorado, that accepts cryptocurrency, told CoinDesk he was “able to partner and sponsor the local university (Colorado State University), be their first cannabis industry partner and reach out to the college community in a way our competitors cannot.”  Amy Deneson, a crypto and cannabis marketing specialist, has also “noticed an uptick in hotels and hospitality services in legal markets accepting payments in cryptocurrencies and psychedelic experiences.”  Despite being on the fringe in the past, cannabis and crypto have become mainstream. More than ever, both industries are connected at the hip. Some cannabis organizations are decentralized autonomous organizations like the People’s DAO, which is primarily for BIPOC (Black, indigenous, people of color) leaders in the cannabis industry to gain access to capital, and there are other organizations that provide NFT services to strengthen their community.  Small street dealers on the black market are even becoming increasingly open to accepting crypto.  One individual from New York City told CoinDesk he was open to creating a wallet to accept crypto if there was a demand, albeit there would be an increased fee for paying in crypto rather than in dollars. And another from California, who stopped distributing marijuana but not other substances, indicated that he routinely accepted crypto as payment.  Cannabis and crypto have now reached a point where it is impossible not to recognize the substantial changes in the culture of the overlapping industries.  More money, more problems  Although the cannabis industry’s lack of access to banking is its most well-known issue, it’s far from the biggest, according to experts.  Bob Solomon, a professor of law at the University of California, Irvine and co-chairman of the UCI Center for the Study of Cannabis, told CoinDesk that the tax burden, not banking, is the top issue facing the cannabis industry.  Because cannabis is still illegal federally, the industry is subject to Section 280E of the tax code, which means cannabis businesses must pay taxes without deducting the usual business expenses, making profit margins very small.  Henry Baskerville, the owner of Colorado-based law firm Fortis Law Partners, told CoinDesk that the Section 280E tax requirements mean cannabis companies pay around a 70% tax rate, compared with the average corporate tax rate of 20%.  “A lot of people get into cannabis thinking that they’ll make money hand over fist, but they aren’t taking into consideration these taxes and smaller profit margins, so they fail,” Baskerville said.  The burden isn’t just on cannabis companies, though – it’s also passed to the consumers. Solomon told CoinDesk that taxes pile up at every level, including local surcharges, which makes it difficult for legal dispensaries to compete with the black market.  With tight profit margins and cash-flow issues, the volatility of crypto is an even bigger risk to cannabis companies.  Khurshid Khoja, co-chairman for policy at the National Cannabis Industry Association, told CoinDesk that even crypto-savvy retailers are concerned about the volatility of crypto markets and potential tax implications of accepting crypto payments.  Read more: Khurshid Khoja – Why the Marijuana Industry Needs Crypto  “They don’t want to think that they will accept cryptocurrency payments and be exposed to either capital-gains risk or the risk that these currencies will lose their value suddenly and without warning when tax payments and rent are due,” Khoja said.  In addition to taxes, access to commercial lending is a serious difficulty for cannabis companies. Would-be dispensary owners and growers struggle to find loans with reasonable interest rates.  “Credit is a pain point for sure,” said Dave Rodman, a Colorado-based lawyer who specializes in crypto and cannabis law. “There are ‘hard money’ loans tied to real estate and sometimes large assets, but that is it.”  An unfair stigma?  Some experts, including Baskerville, have also suggested that because both the cannabis and crypto industries exist in a regulatory gray area, there is a potential that working together could be stigmatized.  “There’s already scrutiny on the cannabis industry and potential for criminal activity, theft and so on,” Baskerville said. “Adding another industry like crypto that has similar issues has the potential to multiply problems.”  Khoja told CoinDesk he believes the lingering stigma is a result of the Silk Road case and resulting public perception of cryptocurrency as a tool primarily used to buy illegal drugs.  “I am embarrassed to say that I used to be in that camp as well many years ago,” Khoja said. “I would joke with my clients that they should break one federal law at a time … as an advocate for cannabis businesses, I wanted to avoid any inference, no matter how far-fetched, that legal cannabis businesses were engaging in any other unlawful drug commerce.  Read more: Crypto, Cannabis and SAFE Banking  “The truth is, of course, that the blockchain is the ultimate audit trail for any regulator concerned about drug cartels using legal cannabis businesses as fronts to launder illegal drug money,” Khoja added. “Every last sat is accounted for – we know how the businesses got it and from what wallets.”  A cannabis dispensary’s perspective  The rise of instant crypto-to-cash payment platforms has helped some crypto-curious cannabis companies feel more comfortable about accepting crypto payments, both in terms of avoiding volatility and ensuring compliance with regulations.  Mitchell of Flower Power told CoinDesk that he wasn’t comfortable accepting crypto payments until the dispensary partnered with ForumPay, a crypto payments platform.  “Compliance in the cannabis industry is huge, and I didn't want to risk entering a gray area on my own without the guidance of an organization that specialized in this field,” Mitchell said.  Mitchell said ForumPay has been an alternative to credit card processors that has been easy for the dispensary’s staff to use.  Though the option to pay with crypto is still used by only a few of Flower Power’s customers, Mitchell said the number of crypto payments has been growing consistently.  “I do believe it has attracted new customers and piqued a lot of people’s curiosity into crypto,” Mitchell said. “At the very least, it’s another option for our customers who don’t always want to carry cash … ForumPay does not charge a monthly subscription, so it does us no harm in offering this utility to our base.”  The SAFE Banking Act  Much of the cannabis industry’s struggles to access banking could be resolved with the passage of the SAFE Banking Act, which would allow banks and other financial institutions to provide banking services to legal cannabis businesses without the fear of being punished by federal regulators.  The bill has broad bipartisan support, It has been passed several times by the House but has repeatedly failed in the Senate, most recently in July.  “SAFE won’t clean up all of the industry’s problems, but it would have a significant impact,” Baskerville told CoinDesk. “Some cannabis business owners are paying in the range of $2K a month just for the pleasure of having a bank account.”  Others have stressed, however, that even if the SAFE Banking Act passes, the industry could continue to struggle with high fees and other banking-related issues.  “SAFE wouldn’t require banks to make business lending available, and it wouldn’t necessarily cause banks to reduce the fees they charge cannabis businesses,” Khoja said.  Even if the SAFE Banking Act – like crypto – isn't a full solution for the cannabis industry’s myriad problems, it’s still a necessary step in the right direction.  “To operate in [the cannabis] industry, you have to have banking regardless,” Mitchell said. “Payroll, taxes, operating expenses/utilities, etc. ... too many ‘what-ifs’ if you tried to 100% depend on crypto rather than fiat that would hinder the ability to be successful.  “[Crypto is] a great tool in addition to the standard business practices, but I do not think it is the answer,” Mitchell added.  Blockchain technology for supply-chain management  Crypto may not be the “answer” to all of the problems inherent in the cannabis industry. But Sundie Seefried, CEO and president of Safe Harbor Financial, which has provided cannabis banking services since 2015 and processed more than $14 billion, is excited about the possible implementation of blockchain technology.  A regulator expressed to Seefried that crypto and cannabis could be a good match because blockchain technology provides a good traceability factor for funds derived from cannabis plants, she said.  Safe Harbor now relies on a couple of different sources to track the cannabis plants, which increases the risk that something won't be properly accounted for.  “Start to finish, I know that’s a legitimate [cannabis] plant right from the get-go, if we do this correctly,” Seefried said in regards to the potential of integrating blockchain technology.  Ben Bartlett, a member of the city council of Berkeley, Calif., and a crypto lawyer, expressed a similar idea. Blockchain technology can help cannabis companies have compliant supply chains by proving provenance and tracking ownership.  “The cannabis industry has a lot of friction, a lot of redundancy and a lot of authentication. That's a problem, and through the use of blockchain technology, everything is transparent. With the automated use of smart contracts, it significantly decreases the amount of friction in the cannabis industry,” he said.",NEUTRAL,SAFE,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | SAFE,"Cheyenne Ligon, Sage D.

II (VCXA) that would’ve made it a public company, has left the firm, according to two people familiar with the move.  Gaurav Budhrani, the now-former CEO, was with PrimeBlock for about a year, according to his LinkedIn profile. He had come aboard from Goldman Sachs (GS), where he’d spent more than a decade, most recently as a vice president who helped run crypto investment banking.  Both the company and Budhrani weren’t available to comment on the move.  It's not clear what led to the departure, or where he is heading to. However, the move comes after the mining company earlier this month terminated its merger with 10X Capital Venture Acquisition, a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). The deal was announced in April.  PrimeBlock didn’t give any reason for the termination of the merger. However, the crypto space as a whole has been under pressure amid falling prices, and that has caused pain in mining, squeezing profits among other things. Another miner, Gryphon Digital Mining, also recently terminated its own takeover deal with a SPAC, citing market conditions as one of the main reasons.  SPAC deals have been a prevalent means for crypto companies to access public stock markets in recent years, but their attraction has cooled following the downturn in digital asset markets.

42421473,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoPrZ,1661970600,The SEC Is Getting Clearer About How It Plans to Regulate Crypto,"Zcash, horizen and stellar might be securities, according to new regulatory filings. We’re starting to get even more clarity about the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s efforts to bring the cryptocurrency sector in line with its existing regulations.  For those of you who received the trial daily newsletter last week and want to provide feedback, I fixed the form! Also, I should clarify: That’s a separate product that the CoinDesk regulation team may publish, but it would not replace this newsletter, which would remain a weekly offering.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Whither securities law?  The narrative  Grayscale Investments, a subsidiary of CoinDesk parent company Digital Currency Group, disclosed in regulatory filings that the SEC has been asking about its analysis of zcash (ZEC), horizen (ZEN) and stellar (XLM). Moreover, the regulator appears to have suggested that those three cryptocurrencies might be securities under federal law.  Why it matters  The SEC has yet to begin any kind of formal effort to issue rules directing crypto exchanges to register as securities exchanges. In the absence of that formal rulemaking effort, we’re left looking at how the SEC seems to be approaching cryptocurrencies it sees as securities. News that it identified more cryptocurrencies as securities this year sheds (a tiny bit) more light on that question.  Breaking it down  ZEC, ZEN and XLM may be securities, Grayscale said in regulatory filings for its trust products based on those three cryptocurrencies.  The SEC’s Divisions of Corporation Finance and Enforcement contacted Grayscale earlier this year, CoinDesk’s Danny Nelson reported over the weekend, asking about the trust products tied to those three cryptocurrencies.  What’s more, reading between the lines, it would appear the SEC has said those cryptocurrencies might be securities.  “The SEC staff has not provided any guidance as to the security status of ZEC and the sponsor has been contacted by staff from the SEC’s Divisions of Corporation Finance and Enforcement concerning the sponsor’s securities law analysis of ZEC,” the filing for Zcash said in June.  The filing in August said Grayscale received a memorandum from its “external securities lawyer,” which led the company to feel comfortable in saying those three cryptocurrencies aren’t securities, but nevertheless, based on what the SEC has said, Grayscale “acknowledges that ZEC [etc.] may currently be a security, based on the facts as they exist today, or may in the future be found by the SEC or a federal court to by a security under the federal securities laws.”  An observer can couple that report with the SEC’s previous claims that nine other cryptocurrencies are securities under federal law to get hints on how the agency is approaching the issue.  There's two things that strike me about the SEC’s thinking.  First, the SEC is really ramping up. We still don’t have any kind of formal rulemaking process directing crypto trading platforms to register as securities exchanges, but the agency is clearly building up a set of precedents. Remember, the SEC’s inquiry to Grayscale comes alongside the SEC calling nine other cryptocurrencies securities just a few months ago.  The other thing is just which cryptocurrencies are listed. Grayscale offers trusts with exposure to all sorts of cryptos: basic attention token (BAT), bitcoin cash (BCH), Decentraland’s MANA token, ethereum classic (ETC) and so on. The SEC specified ZEC, ZEN and XLM.  XLM is an easy one. It’s fairly similar to XRP, and the SEC is now 20 months into a legal fight over whether XRP sales were securities sales. The agency treating XLM similarly makes sense.  ZEN … I’ve got to be honest, I completely forgot that this token even existed. I remember it getting some attention in like 2018 and haven’t heard anything about or from it since. That being said, it’s supported by Horizen Labs, i.e. a centralized entity. And Digital Currency Group founder Barry Silbert seems to have implied that the token’s value would increase, citing a Horizen Labs’ press release after a recent fundraising round. So, sure, I can see the argument here.  Zcash is the one that’s raising alarm. It did have a “premine” (albeit paid out differently from Ethereum) and it has a ""dev tax"" (a percent of mined ZEC goes to Electric Coin Co.) – two reasons why the token would be deemed to be a security. But we don’t know that for sure yet.  Regardless, in the absence of that formal rulemaking process, we’re left to look at what the SEC has done so far to try to understand how the SEC is defining “securities” as they pertain to digital assets – and this is more specific than just SEC Chairman Gary Gensler saying every crypto he sees looks like a security.  Biden’s rule  Changing of the guard  Nothing new to report, move along now.  Outside CoinDesk:  (The Washington Post) Peiter Zatko, Twitter’s former chief of security, has alleged major issues with how Twitter protects its systems from spam and hackers.

The deciding factor will be if the Merge – a software update on Ethereum that is scheduled to take place next month – goes as planned, Linden said on CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" show on Wednesday.  “We have a chain in testnet right now that is fully EVM compatible,” Linden said, referring to ""Ethereum virtual machine.""  Linden’s comments come ahead of Ethereum's transition to a proof-of-stake model of maintaining the network and verifying transactions from a proof-of-work one. The shift is intended to reduce transaction times and fees and to increase security.  Read more: What is the Ethereum Merge?  Linden said Mythical Games has been building the chain over the last couple of years, but Ethereum’s “massive gas fees” were a drawback. It’s hard to validate “big external fees” for users, particularly on a $10 video-game item, he added.  The company now uses the EOS.IO blockchain platform, which Linden said has allowed Mythical Games to create its own forked chain. “We added our own level of EVM compatibility over the top,” he said. “We added bridges back to Ethereum.”  “As EVM’s caught up to proof-of-stake, we’ve been leaning heavier into that tech stack,” Linden said.  Linden didn't fully disclose whether Mythical Games is moving to the Ethereum blockchain just yet, but said that his company sees “some efficiencies [in] having a true kind of EVM chain behind the scenes.”  Read more: Ethereum After the Merge: What Comes Next?",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | TECHNOLOGY,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/08/31/mythical-games-is-building-an-ethereum-compatible-chain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/36ebcca04a3c3b26e4b4be6c6352f07555c5e0f4-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Racine announced in a tweet on Wednesday.  In addition, Racine tweeted that his office is suing MicroStrategy “for conspiring to help him evade taxes he legally owes on hundreds of millions of dollars he’s earned while living” in Washington.  The attorney general's office alleged Saylor avoided paying more than $25 million in taxes to the district and is seeking back taxes, treble damages, civil penalties, expenses and fees.  Saylor is a bitcoin (BTC) maximalist who has bet the business software company’s future on the cryptocurrency, amassing billions of dollars of worth it over the past few years. He recently stepped down as CEO to focus on MicroStrategy’s bitcoin strategy.  Also on Twitter, Racine wrote that the action is ""the first lawsuit brought under [the district’s] recently amended False Claims Act encouraging whistleblowers to report residents who evade our tax laws by misrepresenting their residence.""  MicroStrategy shares lost almost 4% Wednesday following Racine’s tweets. In a statement, Saylor said that although MicroStrategy headquarters is in Virginia, he had moved to Miami Beach. ""Florida is where I live, vote, and have reported for jury duty, and it is at the center of my personal and family life,"" he said. ""I respectfully disagree with the position of the District of Columbia, and look forward to a fair resolution in the courts.""  According to a copy of the complaint shared with CoinDesk, Saylor lived in a penthouse in Washington while ""masquerading"" as a resident of Florida or Virginia, by purchasing property and registering to vote in these states. However, he still lived in the district for at least 183 days per year, which is the minimum to be a ""statutory resident.""  The district attorney general's office also alleged that Saylor had MicroStrategy report his residency as being in Florida in forms filed with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service.  ""Concerned about MicroStrategy’s involvement in Defendant Saylor’s fraudulent scheme to avoid District taxes, in or about 2014, MicroStrategy’s then-Chief Financial Officer undertook a count of the number of days that Defendant Saylor spent in Florida as compared to the District and found that because Saylor spent the majority of each year in the District, MicroStrategy could not justify misreporting Saylor’s residency to federal tax official,"" the complaint said.  In a statement, MicroStrategy called the District of Columbia case ""a personal tax matter involving Mr. Saylor.""

The Swiss megabank recently reported holding CHF31 million (roughly $32 million) in assets and liabilities it cryptically described as the following: “of which digital asset safeguarding assets.” It didn’t report holding those assets in the prior two quarters. The filing didn’t provide a breakdown of what the “digital assets” were.  Those assets are likely closer to tokenized ski resorts than to market-leading cryptos like bitcoin and ether. Credit Suisse disclosed it was holding tokenized securities for its clients in accordance with accounting guidance from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, a person familiar with the situation said.  Read more: Credit Suisse Creates Ethereum-Based Shares in Swiss Resort  The so-called “SAB 121” directs firms that hold “crypto assets” for clients to report them as both assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. Regulators unveiled the guidance in March in an effort to highlight the “significant risks” of crypto custody. Credit Suisse noted in its second quarter financial report that it now follows that accounting guidance.  Still, Credit Suisse appears to have missed the SEC guidance’s call for “clear disclosure of the nature of” its crypto assets because it revealed only an amount. That the bank didn't say what the digital assets are leaves room for confusion.  Credit Suisse declined to comment.  Big banks, including Citigroup, BNY Mellon, Goldman Sachs and State Street, all made SAB 121 shout-outs in their most recent quarterly financial reports, perhaps laying the accounting disclosure groundwork for their own crypto custody plans. None of them had any crypto-asset holdings to account for in the second quarter, however.  Some crypto companies, like crypto exchange Coinbase, have also begun to report crypto risks in compliance with the new SEC rule. Coinbase famously reported that its customers risked losing their assets in the event it went bankrupt, though CEO Brian Armstrong later specified that this was purely a pro forma warning in line with SAB 121.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/08/31/credit-suisse-held-31m-in-digital-assets-for-clients-last-quarter,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/77b18b839501564f586a09a1a532234868f4e43c-1341x1006.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421458,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoPc5,1661965433,When White Hat Hackers Go Bad,"In most cases, cybersecurity can be achieved through ethical hacking – an established practice used to identify weaknesses and offer guidance on vulnerabilities. But, as with most things having to do with blockchain, the issue becomes a gray area.  To stay ahead of the attackers, those considered “ethical hackers” in crypto rely on some questionable tactics. These include using deep security inspection as well as the most recent offensive security techniques, such as advanced penetration testing (or pen-testing), in order to surface important vulnerabilities before they are exploited.  Luis Llubeck is the technical education specialist of Halborn. This article is part of CoinDesk’s Sin Week series.  To emulate the most recent actions and methods taken by threat actors, pen-testing needs to be carried out on everything from web applications, mobile applications and APIs to wallets and layer 1 blockchains.  A decentralized application, network or system that makes use of blockchain technology is subjected to a security audit known as a ""penetration test."" The goal is to find and alert security flaws before a malevolent user can.  Penetration testing is intended to fix vulnerabilities in the code by deliberately exploiting the target's weaknesses while adopting the mindset of a potential adversary. Sometimes you need to think like a criminal in order to beat them.  Read more: In Defense of Crime | Sin Week  Obviously, this raises concerns that even “ethical hackers” can gain insight into a system, and later exploit it. This has seemingly occurred in the past. White-hat hackers must go deep into a system while, at the same time, avoiding the temptations of the seven deadly sins:  PRIDE, the foremost sin, can lead any hacker to become a target. If an ethical hacker has the arrogance to believe their talents supersede all else – including the law – the ethical hacker can become a target for other hackers, or worse.  Under no circumstances should a penetration tester try to break a system without proper authorization from the company or the person in charge. This is considered an illegal action. And for the justice system, no amount of good deeds in the past can possibly overcome the consequences of crossing the line.  The ethical hacker carries with them a balance between internal and external motivations. On one shoulder sits the specter of reward and fame, and on the other sits sharing knowledge in the act of ensuring societal security (or at least that of the company for which they work). When this balance is tipped and personal fame or monetary gain is valued over sharing of knowledge and security, the hacker falls to the sin of GREED.  Read more: Criminal Crypto Use Is Growing, but That’s Just Half the Story  To combat this, they never use a virtual private network (VPN) to mask the internet protocol (IP) address from where their test is done. They always leave traces for outside observers that make it easy to recognize an attack vector. Obfuscation of knowledge will quickly lead to them to be excluded from the communities of ethical hackers - those who grow through shared knowledge.  Great hackers have the impetus to want more, know more, learn more, break more. In order not to fall into the sin of GLUTTONY, it is imperative to set limits. An ethical hacker must be certain to refine the scope of the penetration test to be performed, setting limits on what can be done and just how far one can go in trying to break the system.  Of course, hacking knowledge should never be used to gain unauthorized access to sensitive material, otherwise known as the temptation of LUST. As enticing as it may be to take a peek or go where no one has gone before, an ethical hacker must set boundaries. This means never sharing internal documentation or non-public knowledge with even their trusted counterparts.  To be an ethical hacker is to be on a path of constant learning, thus LAZINESS is one of the worst sins imaginable. Technology advances at hyperspeed. An ethical hacker always assumes that there is more to learn.  Read more: The Perverse Impacts of the Anti-Money-Laundering System | Sin Week  During a penetration test they must make sure to follow all procedures, go by the book and never perform experiments on the same machines or systems used in live production or daily tasks, as this can put the tester's own equipment at risk to malicious code. This can be the difference between “life and death,” since a real attacker could gain access to the client before the failure can even be detected.  ENVY must also be avoided at all costs. Using sensitive information from a company that was found during the penetration test for personal benefit is not only off-limits but downright illegal. Meanwhile, failure to acknowledge a teammate's expertise must also be avoided. Teamwork and understanding of strengths and growth areas is essential for comprehensive high-quality testing.  Not every penetration test ends in success; perhaps no error is found or is not found in time. Under no circumstance shall the ethical hacker travel down the path of ANGER. Losing control can lead to even more dangerous mistakes, such as not being able to respond in time to an incident, compounding damage in response to that incident or lack of learning from the event.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MINING | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Luis Lubeck,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/08/31/when-white-hat-hackers-go-bad,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/50f0785e06ff6855b1b0993f449e9c228fcff8e8-2550x1913.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411078,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giBzig,1661964894,"As the Gun Market Moves to Crypto, Deeply Private Owners Reveal More Than They May Know","In American gun culture, a desire for privacy runs deep. For many gun owners, any government attempt to keep tabs on who owns what is a non-starter. “I’m not for any type of registration,” John Crump, the special projects coordinator at the Gun Owners of America, said in a recent interview.  Cryptocurrency advocates have a similar ethos and often talk about empowering people to avoid government oversight via their newfangled financial ecosystem.  This piece is part of CoinDesk's Sin Week.  Crump lives in the overlap between those two worlds. At GOA, which describes itself, quoting former U.S. congressman (and presidential candidate) Ron Paul, as ""the only no-compromise gun lobby in Washington,"" he’s an in-house expert on crypto and blockchains.  The latter, of course, is what makes crypto possible in the first place. Blockchains are digital accounting ledgers that publicly track when a token moves from one person to another. While built to be anonymous (nobody has to record their identity in a blockchain), that shroud of secrecy can be pierced by law enforcement or anyone with the right sleuthing skills.  And that’s where crypto can get tricky for gun owners. In effect, when someone purchases a gun with a cryptocurrency, a digital paper trail is created. The blockchain record might not spell out the name of the buyer and seller or what gun was exchanged, but the transaction is logged so privacy cannot be assured.  “Honestly, I don't think a lot of people realize how everything is traceable,” Crump said. “A lot of people in the firearms market, when they hear bitcoin or crypto, they automatically assume that it's untraceable and private. But they don't realize that blockchain is a ledger. Everything is there.”  Blockchain: A viable solution?  Guns are a deeply divisive issue in the U.S., making it hard to imagine any compromise between those who advocate for them and those who want restrictions. But not all gun-control advocates want to ban firearms. They just want hurdles, aiming to keep weapons away from people who will cause havoc. Blockchains are one proposed solution, pitched as a solution that would also permit at least some privacy.  Read More: Binance Froze Russian Gun Maker's Crypto Assets, Likely at Ukraine’s Request  Tom Heston, a clinical associate professor at Washington State University’s Department of Medical Education and Clinical Sciences, approaches the gun-violence epidemic from a public health perspective. His 2017 paper titled “A Blockchain Solution to Gun Control” proposes a blockchain-powered universal ID to track guns and ammunition. That, Heston argues, would help enforce gun-control measures such as red-flag laws, which let police temporarily seize firearms from people thought to be a danger to themselves or others.  Such a system, he argues, wouldn’t include personal information like names or addresses on the blockchain. But if law enforcement needed to identify someone it could do so by connecting a crypto wallet address to the actual person behind it. “Having a way to identify people while also maintaining their privacy is, I think, that combination that cryptocurrency brings,” Heston said in an interview.  The gun lobby strongly disagrees with Heston’s take on registries and privacy. (In June, the state of California accidentally leaked the personal information of gun owners, the worst nightmare of privacy-focused gun owners.) Heston counters this argument by sharing that Congress has just passed a gun-safety law, “and those red-flag laws require databases. So why don't we have a database that protects privacy?”  The National Rifle Association, the 151-year-old gun-rights group, isn’t receptive. “The NRA is now and will always be against a firearm registry of any kind for the simple fact that registries lead to confiscation,” said Lars Dalseide, a spokesperson.  While GOA’s Crump basically agrees with the NRA, he suspects an important kind of record required by the U.S. Department of Justice might get moved onto a blockchain: Form 4473. When buying from a gun dealer or another seller licensed by the U.S. government, the purchaser must present a 4473 to the retailer, which states the personal information of the person purchasing the gun, as well as the gun serial number and who the seller is. The paper document is then kept in the shop forever. These forms are not digitized, partly because many gun owners don’t want a database storing their personal information. (The 1986 Firearm Owners Protection Act prevents the federal government from creating and maintaining a gun registry.)  “Am I for that?” Crump said of digitizing 4473s on a blockchain. “No.” But he added: “I do see that as something that could be done and I do see that as being the future, even though I’m not for it.”  Purchasing firearms is easier with crypto  The gun market has embraced crypto partly because some conventional payment processors no longer handle firearms transactions, or have made doing business through them financially untenable. Stripe (STRIP) and PayPal (PYPL), for instance, completely ban gun sales through their platforms. Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) tack on a transaction fee of up to 7% for firearms retailers.  Broader use of crypto in the gun industry would “eliminate the ability of gun-control groups to manipulate financial institutions into circumventing our electoral, legislative as well as our regulatory process when calling for the de-banking of a perfectly legal industry,” the NRA’s Dalseide said.  Read More: Trigger Warning: Why the 3D-Printed Gun Debate Matters to Crypto  There are projects that aim to make firearms more accessible through crypto. The Universal Settlement Coin (TUSC) is a cryptocurrency designed to facilitate paying for things when conventional digital money isn’t an option. Paying for guns is just one example. (In theory, this could also include paying doctors for abortions in states where the medical procedure is illegal, or buying marijuana where it’s outlawed.)  “The gun world is an industry that absolutely can benefit from crypto because traditional finance hates the gun industry,” Rob McNealy, one of the project’s founders, said in an interview.  As for paying for guns with cryptocurrencies, expect that to continue, even if the original promise of crypto – anonymity – isn’t always achieved. Crump, the GOA crypto expert, says he has paid for guns with bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and TUSC, and will continue to do so.  “I have used crypto to buy guns online,” he said. “But if I wanted to be private, it’s something I wouldn't do.”",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | BNB,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/08/31/as-the-gun-market-moves-to-crypto-deeply-private-owners-reveal-more-than-they-may-know,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/09f4e53cfe53a28a99d4ff2e2db2fddeabf114ec-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42373942,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvWNSp,1661961600,Crypto Startup Salaries: Here’s How Much Devs and Others Get Paid,"Is it worth quitting your job to work in crypto?  A new study from crypto venture capital firm Framework helps answer that question by giving a glimpse into startup salaries, offering concrete info for anyone seeking to join the crypto gold rush.  The venture capital firm surveyed 18 companies in which it is invested to get a sense of pay. Highlights include salaries well into the six-figure range for both technical and non-technical roles, including one high-flying engineer raking in $300,000 in base pay. Founders can also expect to receive a mid-single-digit percent allocation of tokens and, in rare instances, up to 10% of the total supply.  “There’s currently no Glassdoor or Levels equivalent for Web3,” said Daniel Mason, operating partner at Framework Ventures and leader of the survey effort. He explained that releasing this data benefits “both founders and job seekers by improving transparency in the ecosystem.”  Conducted in May, the anonymized survey spanned early-stage companies varying in size from two to 80 employees. Companies in Framework’s portfolio are largely focused on Ethereum-based decentralized finance (DeFi) projects, infrastructure and Web3 gaming, including lending protocol Aave, play-to-earn game Illuvium and stablecoin project Fei.  The data reveals both base salaries and allocations of equity and/or crypto tokens for four key groups: founders, executives (non-founder c-suite hires), engineers and non-engineer operators (sales, marketing, recruiting, etc.).  ""Base salaries between Web2 and Web3 roles are comparable, but it's the token upside that's the kicker,"" said Dan Eskow, founder of crypto recruiting firm Up Top. ""Even a small token allocation can become very valuable if the project becomes the next billion-dollar protocol.""  For those looking to ride the next crypto rocket ship, Framework’s Mason thinks there’s no better time than in a bear market – which continues in crypto.  “Nothing is certain when it comes to compensation packages, but I think it's generally preferable to lock in terms when a project or company is priced at a lower valuation,” said Mason. “While FAANG stocks are down 30%-35% year to date, crypto is down much more, and so I think it follows that it's possible that those joining the right project now could one day see more upside than those who joined at the top of the last bull market.”  Founder compensation  Early-stage companies: $100K-$175K annually, with $130K-$160K representing the top of the bell curve  Later-stage companies: $175K-$225K  Non-token equity: Approximately 80% owned by founders in early stages, diluted to 20%-50% in later rounds  Token equity: Founding teams own 8%-12% of max token supply, with individual founders owning between 2.5%-7.5%, with 4%-6% being most common. The highest ownership percentage surveyed (10%) was from a solo founder at an early-stage startup.  For early-stage companies, founders tend to pay themselves the minimum amount to maintain a comfortable but basic quality of life.  Salaries ran higher for U.S.-based founders and slightly lower for international founders, depending especially on location and cost of living.  For decentralized networks (DAO), token ownership (versus equity) is the standard way of incentivizing employees  Non-founder executive compensation  Early-stage companies: $120K-$160K  Later-stage companies: $225K+  Non-token equity: 1%-4% of company equity at early-stage companies; 1%-2% of company equity at later-stage companies  Token equity: 0.5%-1% of max token supply at DAOs and protocols with a token at later-stage companies  C-level engineering and business development hires were often the highest paid non-founder executives.  Many executive sales roles have high variable-based compensation in the form of performance-based bonuses.  Floor pay was higher for U.S.-based executives.  Engineer compensation  U.S.-based engineers: typically $125K-$160K, with a median of $150K  Global engineers: typically $100K-150K, with a median of $125K  Token equity: 0.1%-0.4% of max token supply  Highest-paid engineer surveyed hauled in $300K  Compensation was highly location-dependent, with U.S. engineers commanding higher salaries.  Figures do not include bonuses.  Crypto-specific engineers with knowledge of Solidity and Rust programming languages and blockchain architecture commanded higher salaries.  Non-founder business operations compensation  Business development and partnerships: $60K-$120K for mid-level; $150K for senior-level  Marketing and communications: $80K-$100K for mid-level; $140K for senior-level  Product and finance: $60K-$120K for mid-level; $150K for senior-level, typically only hired at later-stage companies  Operations, design, recruiting, community management: up to $130K  Token equity: project dependent",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Tracy Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/08/31/crypto-startup-salaries-heres-how-much-devs-and-others-get-paid,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f2b64e6e22efa2f94d22d364c01261585366ddc5-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421475,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoPqX,1661960809,Then They Fight You: Scenarios for Coming Crypto Regulation,"I can’t count how many times over the years I’ve seen someone on Crypto Twitter trot out the old saw that starts with “First they ignore you, then they laugh at you …” Well, be careful what you wish for, because over the past year, we’ve clearly reached the “then they fight you” portion of the quote often misattributed to Mahatma Gandhi.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  For more than a decade, regulators including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission have been imposing only minimal restraints and targeting egregious frauds for prosecution, but otherwise leaving crypto largely to its own devices. But when Gary Gensler was appointed to head the SEC under the Biden administration, he signaled early and often his intention to take a more rigorous approach.  That attitude has manifested in a variety of ways, even beyond Gensler’s formal domain. In May, the SEC doubled the number of staffers in its enforcement division who were focused on crypto. Sanctions against the Tornado Cash privacy software by the Office of Foreign Assets Control have triggered the most acute worry in the industry, and will face legal challenges. And last week saw filings from Grayscale Investments acknowledging, in response to an SEC inquiry, that the stellar, zcash and horizen crypto tokens “may currently be” securities. (Grayscale and CoinDesk are both owned by Digital Currency Group.)  Some of this increased scrutiny may be simply a consequence of crypto’s growing influence and stakes, rather than entirely due to Gensler. According to law blog Legal Intelligencer, cryptocurrency enforcement actions by the SEC have shot up to 79 for the three years from 2018 to 2021 from just 18 between 2013 and 2017.  See also: As SEC Leans on Enforcement to Regulate, Crypto Lawyers Study Every Word | Opinion  But it also does no good to deny the obvious: Gensler came in ready to regulate, and he got a convenient mandate courtesy of the immense amount of truly damaging fraud and foolhardy experimentation in crypto. That was always present, but the increased exposure of the general public to crypto speculation during the 2020-2022 bull market made the situation far more dangerous than it had been.  Possible outcomes  There are two, maybe three, possible outcomes here. The most likely, unfortunately, is that Gensler’s SEC places mounting legal pressure on both token issuers and exchanges, primarily using even more enforcement actions to treat tokens as securities in a relatively uniform way. That would almost certainly strangle many good crypto projects along with the bad.  The preferable alternative would be a real attempt to structure rules that wouldn’t hamper the potential of this new technology, along the lines of the formal time-limited safe harbor proposed by SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce.  That proposal included data-reporting requirements for token projects (good) but didn’t place any prior restraints on entities that wanted to try something new (also good). Personally, I would love to see additional safe-harbor permissions for tokens with very low value, the sort that might be deployed for small-scale DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations) or other truly community-driven projects.  But let’s be realistic: Regulation that leaves substantial room for experimentation isn’t particularly likely to come to fruition. In part, that’s because Congress remains a bit of an ineffectual mess, ill-equipped to craft complex and rational new rules.  But more fundamentally, the SEC and other regulators just aren’t set up to grapple with the truly mind-bending complexities of blockchain’s crossover between technology and finance. That disconnect may be inevitable, because regulation implies a normative vision of the way things “should” be.  Embracing risk and chaos and figuring it out as we go is probably the only real way to find out the long-term potential of these innovations.  Growth and hucksterism  But that possibility has basically closed over the past two years, thanks to a combination of real growth and shameless hucksterism. Figures like Alex Mashinsky and Do Kwon conveniently disregarded the experimental nature of the products they were promoting to the general public, and real engineers and designers tinkering at the truly bleeding edge are poised to pay a completely undeserved penalty.  As these tighter constraints close in, it will be increasingly important to remember what’s actually being targeted by stricter regulation. Ultimately, the problem is not cryptocurrency or blockchain itself, which are merely technologies. The problem is that they have been overhyped and exploited to further a much larger system in which promotion of high-risk investments yield big rewards, even if those investments are more likely to get vaporized.  See also: The Trash Moat: When the Media Lies About Crypto | Opinion  The same dynamic is in play in the “regulated” venture capital industry. We recently saw the absurdity of another $350 million being handed to low-rent P.T. Barnum Adam Neumann, who became a billionaire in the course of destroying $11 billion of other people’s money at WeWork. Is Neumann a smarter, better or more trustworthy person than Do Kwon? That seems like a stretch.  Of course, there is a potential upside as the crackdown ramps up: It could return cryptocurrency to its roots. The fat days of loose oversight removed incentives to build truly robust systems that could operate beyond government reach in favor of fragile systems with superficial features that could be shilled to retail traders and investors. Features like censorship resistance and true decentralization are about to get a lot more important, and in the long run, that could be the best outcome of all.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,David Z.

42393789,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpAznx,1661958623,"Binance Froze Russian Gun Maker's Crypto Assets, Amid Ukrainian Pressure","Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by volume, froze a wallet related to Vladislav Lobaev, a Russian gun manufacturer who raised funds for the country's troops in Ukraine, according to a Lobaev representative and blockchain data analysis.  While the Ukrainian government did not mention Lobaev or anyone else by name, last week the Security Service of Ukraine (SSU) published a press release saying the agency “blocked a crypto wallet belonging to a Russian citizen who is sponsoring Russian war in Ukraine.” CoinDesk has confirmed that the wallet was Lobaev’s Binance account.  This article is part of CoinDesk’s Sin Week series.  Lobaev is a founder of Lobaev Arms, a private firm producing rifles and other military ammunition. He is an enthusiastic supporter of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and regularly asks subscribers to his Telegram channel to donate money so that Lobaev can provide more ammunition for the Russian troops in Ukraine.  The channel listed several payment methods for subscribers to donate, including blockchain addresses for bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and tether (USDT).  After the Ukrainian law enforcement discovered the fundraising activity, it apparently persuaded Binance to freeze the account, which by then had received over $21,000 in bitcoin, ether and USDT. Security Service of Ukraine do not respond to CoinDesk’s requests to comment.  Binance would not discuss the ownership of crypto wallets in question.  “Any government or law enforcement agency in the world can make lawful requests regarding users in their jurisdiction provided these are accompanied by the proper legal authority,"" a spokesperson for Binance said. ""However, Binance also protects its users and reserves the right to reject law enforcement requests that don’t stand up to legal scrutiny, where no legal purpose is served or there are flaws in the investigative approach. We apply the same level of scrutiny to requests as any leading bank, financial institution or multinational company would.""  ‘Lobaev Z’  Vladislav Lobaev is a well-known gun manufacturer with right-wing views. Lobaev Arms, which Vladislav Lobaev runs with his brother Nikolay, has been producing firearms since 2003, specializing in sniper rifles. The firm benefitted from earlier sanctions on Russia, when the import of Western ammunition in Russia stopped, the state-run news service Sputnik wrote. The use of Lobaev’s rifles during the war in Ukraine has been advertised by Russian state media.  In his Telegram channel, Lobaev has been actively supporting Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and even re-named his channel as “Lobaev Z,” adding the letter Russian troops put on their vehicles, which became an unofficial symbol of Russia during this war. Lobaev praises Russian troops, analyzes weapons used by the Ukrainian army, and badmouths Ukraine, NATO and the LGBT community.  CoinDesk reached out to Lobaev via a feedback bot in his Telegram channel and got a response from a person saying he was Lobaev’s son Evgeny, who was in charge of the crypto fundraising. He confirmed Lobaev’s Binance account was frozen and said he did not know what to do in this case.  He also sent CoinDesk a screenshot of a chat with the exchange’s support team: According to the customer service rep, the account was “locked due to an account review.”  The exchange stopped accepting Russian bank cards this spring, following the international sanctions on Russia and the exit of MasterCard (MA) and Visa (V) from the country. Asked how he was able to cash out crypto from a Binance account, “Evgeny Lobaev” said he used over-the-counter (OTC) brokers.  He also said cryptocurrencies constituted “not a big part” of all the incoming donations. (Lobaev also uses Russian fiat payment service Yoomoney and an account at the Russian financial institution Sberbank.)  Evgeny Lobaev is not a public person and the rare mentions of him on the internet are usually related to the war. There is a LinkedIn account for a Evgeny Lobaev working as a supply chain coordinator at Lobaev Arms. The person who corresponded to CoinDesk via the Telegram bot did not respond to a question asking whether it was his LinkedIn account or not.  Evgeny Lobaev, according to some accounts, participated in the war himself. In an amateur video published on YouTube March 1, a man in military fatigues is smiling in front of artillery machines shooting. Another amateur video said this person was Evgeny Lobaev and he was captured by Ukrainian forces. Later, a Russian blogger known as WarGonzo published a clip showing a similar looking person, saying it was Lobaev and that he was not captured.  “Lobaev” told CoinDesk he was not captured and he was now in Russia.  Blocked wallets  In its press release, the Security Service of Ukraine (SSU) said it “blocked a crypto wallet belonging to a Russian citizen who is sponsoring Russian war in Ukraine.” The agency said it identified the crypto wallets a certain individual used to raise funds for ammunition and arms that later was being sent to the troops invading Ukraine. The SSU said it was working on ways to confiscate the funds.  The individual, whom SSU did not name, managed to raise an amount equivalent to 800,000 Ukrainian hryvnias (US$21,700), the announcement said, and used that money to buy equipment for the troops of the self-proclaimed People’s Republics of Donetsk and Luhansk – breakaway Eastern regions of Ukraine that have received clandestine armed support from Russia since 2014. Since Russia started a full-fledged invasion of Ukraine in February, it has been actively recruiting the population of these regions for helping its own troops.  The Ukrainian news website Liga.net identified the individual SSU talked about by the photos in the press release with pro-Russian forces carrying weapons, which match photos on Lobaev’s Telegram channel (for example, this one and this one).  According to the blockchain analytics firm Crystal Blockchain, all crypto addresses Lobaev published for fundraising belong to Binance, the largest centralized crypto exchange.  This explains how the Ukrainian authorities were able to block the wallets. Decentralized blockchains, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, do not allow anyone to block or freeze any addresses or transactions. However, centralized custodial exchanges, such as Binance, Coinbase (COIN), FTX, which hold cryptocurrency on their users’ behalf, can refuse service to individual users at the request of authorities.  This happened in the past to accounts that received money stolen from hacked exchanges or designated terrorists. Also, smart contracts for tokens created on top of blockchains, such as the contract that issues USDT, allow freezing individual wallets. Tether, the issuer of USDT, has done so in the past.  Read also: Hamas Tapped Binance to Launder Bitcoin Donations, Blockchain Data Suggests  According to the blockchain data, the bitcoin wallet Lobaev listed for fundraising received over 6.4 BTC (about $19,700) since late April. The ether wallet received 3.25 ETH (over $1,500), a USDT wallet on the Tron blockchain received a little over $840 in the U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin.  All the wallets have been mostly drained of funds, with the latest transactions recorded between late July and Aug. 14. This does not necessarily mean Lobaev was able to cash out all of his crypto donations: deposit addresses for exchanges can be just temporary storage for coins, and what is actually happening to users’ money is not fully reflected on the public blockchain, only in exchanges’ private records.  In July, analytics firm Chainlalysis said 54 pro-Russian militant and volunteer groups raised over $2,2 million on crypto via social media channels. These organizations used donations to buy firearms, medical supplies, satellite communication hardware and other products. The list included Terricon, a group led by the sanctioned Russian citizen Alexander Zhuchkovsky; Rusich, a group associated with the Russian mercenary group known as Wagner; and anonymously written blogs Rybar and SouthPost.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | SPONSORED | BNB,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/08/31/binance-froze-russian-gun-makers-crypto-assets-amid-ukrainian-pressure,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/18b700becf00ab595e946e8094ee0c43a6118a5b-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42373934,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvWNK1,1661958540,Paraguay’s President Vetoes Bill That Would Regulate Crypto Mining and Trading,"Paraguay's President Mario Abdo Benítez fully vetoed a bill proposing to regulate crypto mining and trading in the South American country.  The veto came after recommendations against the bill made by the National Electricity Administration (ANDE), Ministry of Industry and Trade (MIC) and the Paraguayan central bank, according to a presidential release.  The bill will now be sent back to the National Congress where if both chambers ratify it with absolute majorities, it can still be enacted.  In July, Paraguay's Senate approved the bill, after the Chamber of Deputies did the same in May.  The bill calls for putting ANDE in charge of enabling the energy supply for mining, while the Secretariat for the Prevention of Money or Asset Laundering would supervise mining investments carried out by crypto companies. The National Securities Commission would oversee how mining companies would manage the digital assets produced by mining.  Read more: Commons Foundation Signs 100MW Deal for Crypto Mining in Paraguay  In his veto, Abdo cited the opinion of ANDE, which criticized the fact that the bill sets a percentage limit above the industrial rate that be charged to miners, potentially affecting energy providers.  In August, ANDE asked Abdo to partially veto the legislature’s crypto bill and also presented a draft decree to Abdo’s National Economic Team asking to charge a higher tariff to crypto mining companies.  In its recommendation to the executive branch, the Central Bank of Paraguay said that “cryptocurrencies are not backed by any monetary authority and, therefore, their safekeeping is not supervised.” The intention to regulate the industry and trading of virtual assets “could create a false sense of security,” the Paraguayan monetary authority added.  The MIC, for its part, said that the country should concentrate its efforts “on efficient sectors and activities, which at the same time generate economic, social and environmental impact.”  According to Congressman Carlos Rejala, one of the bill’s authors, the bill aims to attract international mining players with the low electricity rates of Paraguay.

42421463,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoPgD,1661956959,The Perverse Impacts of the Anti-Money-Laundering System,"In September 2020, Buzzfeed News and a coalition of other investigators dropped a bombshell on the world of international finance and law enforcement. A leaked set of documents from the U.S. Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, showed a disturbing pattern of lax enforcement. When banks reported suspected money laundering to the very agency tasked with monitoring ill-gotten criminal funds, quite often, the authorities did nothing about it at all.  This was at least a threefold failure. First and most obviously, transactions flagged by banks in Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) to FinCEN weren’t actually being stopped. Second, filing the reports shielded the banks themselves from legal liability, allowing them to continue facilitating criminal transactions (and collecting fees on them).  This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's Sin Week.  This buck-passing two-step led to absurdities like HSBC (HSBC) moving money for the already-sanctioned WCM777 Ponzi scheme, and Standard Chartered (SCBFF) and Deutsche Bank (DB) indirectly facilitating transactions for the Taliban, all while reporting the transactions as clearly suspicious. As Buzzfeed concluded at the time, it seemed that “laws that were meant to stop financial crime have instead allowed it to flourish.”  Less attention was given to the third failing of FinCEN’s SAR system: It compromised the privacy and security of banking customers who had done nothing wrong. Former FBI special agent Michael German at the time described FinCEN’s trove of SARs to Buzzfeed as similar to the huge “data hoards” created by other forms of mass surveillance. They create a rich target for exactly the sort of exfiltration that wound up happening.  Much of the data that became the FinCEN files was initially requested by Congress as part of its investigation of potential Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. It included troves of data about entirely innocent customers, which Buzzfeed and other news organizations carefully redacted. But had the same data fallen into less responsible hands the fallout might have been catastrophic.  The FinCEN files, taken as a whole, revealed the SAR system to be substantially a kind of theatrical performance – one with a steep production budget.  “A pretty sound estimate is that the financial surveillance regime we’ve got costs tens of billions of dollars annually globally. And it might be in the high tens of billions,” says Jim Harper, a privacy advocate and senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a libertarian-leaning think tank.  With that budget, banks were pretending to monitor suspicious financial transactions, and enforcement agencies were pretending to control them. This bit of Kabuki invaded the privacy of innocent customers and threatened the banking relationships of legitimate businesses, while drug lords and oligarchs continued doing business.  The entire system may be less a tool for crime prevention than a means of bureaucratic ass covering, with a rich dollop of authoritarian surveillance on top.  The big risks of 'de-risking'  In theory, anti-money laundering (AML) measures are meant to identify and stop the global movement of funds either earned through criminal activity or intended to fund bad actors. The big-picture goal is to increase human happiness by strangling the bad guys’ finances. Those efforts extend into the realm of cryptocurrency – anti-money laundering measures are why you probably had to provide personal identification, or “know your customer” information, when you signed up to use the Coinbase (COIN) or Binance crypto exchanges.  That requirement illustrates one of the big trade-offs of the current surveillance-heavy AML model. Like FinCEN’s trove of SARs but on an even larger scale, KYC data imposes security risks on law-abiding citizens. In early 2021, for example, a trove of KYC data was hacked from Indian payment app MobiKwik.  But there are deeper, more systemic costs to the current status quo in anti-money laundering efforts. And they fall most heavily on some of the most marginalized and powerless people on Earth.  The entire system may be less a tool for crime prevention, than a means of bureaucratic ass covering.  “It drives up the price of banking across the board,” Jim Harper says. “So the person who feels they can no longer afford a banking account, that’s because of the surveillance that makes it much more expensive.” While AML requirements may not be the only factor, there’s no denying the rising costs and declining services of conventional banking in recent years, which Lisa Servon documented in her excellent 2017 book “The Unbanking of America.”  Another major concern has been the threat of tighter regulation to global trade and developing countries. Stricter sanction regimes and higher fines for violations after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and the 2008 financial crisis appear to have contributed to American banks severing international relationships, a process broadly referred to as “de-risking.” The main culprit here is the set of national blacklists maintained by the global Financial Action Task Force (FATF). Those lists have grown more rapidly in recent years, with noticeable impacts.  “You saw a massive contraction in [international] correspondent banking relationships,” says Matt Collin, a global development specialist who works with the Brookings Institution and the World Bank. For banks in the developing world, losing banking connections to major economies can seriously hamper a local economy’s ability to, for instance, keep stable import/export relationships.  Read more: David Z. Morris - In Defense of Crime  “These [rules] are in general likely to be regressive,” says Collin. In other words, they fall heavily on countries, banks and other entities with fewer resources and less influence over the system itself. “Even if everyone involved is clean, the due diligence is a struggle.”  More to the point, much like the flood of SARs to FinCEN, the de-risking process is more about meeting particular processes and controls than it is about targeting the actual problem of illicit finance.  “Regulators think we need to make sure every country has a similar set of standards,” says Collin. “As an economist, I think you want to go after countries that are hosting a lot of illicit finance. And if you look at where the money ends up, it’s countries that actually have good standards.” Specifically, Collin is referring to the United States – now the top global destination for laundered funds.  “But those countries don’t end up on the [FATF] blacklist,” Collin laments. “ Small African countries end up on the list.”  Does AML actually work?  These risks and barriers could be considered trade-offs for a financial system that restricts criminal activity. But the shocking truth is that we have almost no insight into what exactly we’re getting in return.  “The idea that cracking down on money laundering and tax evasion should eliminate the incentive to commit the predicate crime is a fundamental pillar to this system,” says Matt Collin. “And it’s the most untested part of the theory of change behind the whole apparatus.”  In other words, we have very little solid evidence that harsher anti-money laundering rules reduce the volume of drug trafficking or other major crime. Collin says he is unaware of a single economic study clearly showing a reduction of crime following new AML rules (though he admits such a study might be difficult to design).  One specific example of unclear results is FinCEN’s Geographic Targeting Order for residential real estate. This rule requires sellers to identify the individual person behind all-cash real estate purchases, which are often leveraged for money laundering, tax evasion or capital flight.  “You expect to see a decline in those transactions after that increase of transparency,” says Collin. “And we’ve found no evidence that that changed.”  There is a silver lining, of a sort. While there may or may not be an impact on old-fashioned crime, Collin says recent pushes for more transparency for former tax havens has reduced the amount of tax evasion around the world. “There’s a pretty large decline in deposits in tax havens, so people are responding to it.”  Money laundering to the highest bidder?  Don’t spend too many tears for the wealthy, though. While tax evasion may be getting tougher, money still talks when it comes to AML oversight.  The influence of the wealthy and powerful over the system is sometimes subtle and indirect. For instance, Collin believes the weak results of some current AML efforts are not so much problems with the policies themselves as with their lax and underfunded implementation, both by governments and banks.  Various sorts of information provided to enforcement agencies by banks or real estate titling companies is frequently simply fraudulent and, according to Collin, “FinCEN [and other agencies] just don’t have the ability to verify that that information [in reports] is fully correct.” These deceptions aren’t even subtle: “Lots of companies [in reports] are owned by Jesus Christ and other stuff that seems to have been put in as a joke,” Collin says.  The underfunding of financial oversight bodies is chronic in the U.S., and that tends to benefit those with big money. Before the Biden administration’s recent injection of funding, the Internal Revenue Service had been warning for years that it was severely underfunded. Among other effects, this underfunding led to a decline in audits for the very wealthy, who often use complex maneuvers to reduce their tax burden. Similarly, a new real estate ownership registry that would expand FinCEN’s existing order has missed its deployment deadline because Congress did not fully fund the project.  A truly suspicious mind might wonder who benefits from choking off funding for financial crimes enforcement. U.S. legislators, after all, remain heavily dependent on financial support from large corporations and wealthy individuals. Some government officials, including former Trump administration Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, have been directly damaged by leaks of financial information.  Money has its privileges in other ways, too. Collin says recent research has shown that AML measures may have had less impact on correspondent banking relationships than the declining profitability of specific relationships – but again, the cost of AML compliance is itself contributing to rising costs.  Money plays an even bigger role in how much scrutiny banks subject individual customers do. “It’s easier to look the other way when it’s a Russian oligarch who’s going to bring you millions of dollars,” says Collin. “It’s harder to look the other way when it’s a small business who won’t bring that much.”  Can we fix it?  In some sense, this isn’t news. Financial privacy of any sort has long been much more accessible to the wealthy than to average people. But it’s particularly bitter that AML measures have made profitability and wealth a greater factor in who has access to global banking – including when there really is suspicious activity.  But fixing any of this presents a pernicious political double-bind. As noted, legislators’ wealthy financial backers might not particularly want the AML system to be entirely effective. But banks and legislators alike are highly motivated to create the appearance of strong enforcement, which winds up falling disproportionately on smaller fish.  At the same time, according to AEI’s Harper, any reforms that might decrease financial surveillance and control are nearly verboten among politicians. He points particularly to the current $10,000 threshold for reporting cash transactions to the IRS. In its current form, the requirement is incredibly broad, explicitly including any landlord who receives more than $10,000 in cash payments from a tenant in the course of a year, or a car dealer who sells a car for more than $10,000 in cash.  Read more: How to Pay for Porn With Crypto  But the requirement has become so burdensome and absurd only after decades of legislative inaction. “It was set at $10,000 in 1972,” Harper notes. “The equivalent now is something like $70,000 or $80,000 dollars [due to inflation]. Maybe people moving that much cash a long time ago was inherently suspicious … I don’t agree, but I can at least see the argument.”  “But $10,000? Unfortunately, I have to give that to contractors all the time.”  Correcting this drift, Harper says, has been a political nonstarter because it threatens the entire premise of heightened financial surveillance. “If you open that discussion, you have to open the rest of the discussion.” And banks, despite shouldering added costs, have no leverage to push for cutting red tape because it would make them seem even softer on money launderers than they already (apparently) are.  There are efforts to study the real impact of AML measures, under the banner of “effective AML.” Technological innovation may also play a role in breaking the deadlock: A startup called Consilient is developing machine learning-based AML tools for banks similar to what credit card companies deploy to catch fraud. Crucially, their “federated” data model would reduce the sharing of customer information outside of banks, potentially making it both more private and more effective than the manual, outdated SAR system.  And, of course, there’s a final technological option: an exit from the traditional financial system through cryptocurrency or similar systems. As FinCEN’s recent move against mixer Tornado Cash showed, that opportunity is narrowing, and the practical necessity for real decentralization is growing.  It’s genuinely unclear whether crypto can get there before anti-money laundering efforts with unclear benefits devolve into a quest for complete repressive control. Harper fears that such a locked-down system would inflict serious social harms.  “Complete financial surveillance would create a truly controlled society that would be highly law abiding,” Harper says.  “But it would not be a virtuous society.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | BNB,David Z.

42373938,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvWNNn,1661956448,More Volatility Ahead for Bitcoin as Federal Reserve Keeps Quiet,"More volatility is likely for bitcoin (BTC) in the months ahead as the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization faces decoupling from traditional markets and decreasing forward guidance from the U.S. Federal Reserve.  Bitcoin has already fallen 56% from about $47,500 on Jan. 1 to its current perch just above $20,000. Increased volatility would reflect the Fed’s new data-driven approach that changes the Fed’s current practice of foreshadowing the pace of interest rate hikes before Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings that set monetary policy.  But even more volatility on the downside could be ahead, as macroeconomic uncertainty weighs heavily on crypto investors.  In a July press conference, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told reporters of the change, which means the central bank won't make decisions until the last minute. Investors will likely become more speculative in the absence of clear signals from Fed governors or otherwise.  “Volatility is unlikely to go away in the coming months as the Fed is preparing to step up the process of shrinking its massive $9 trillion balance sheet or the so-called quantitative tightening in September,” Kaiko researchers wrote in a note on Monday. “Together with rising interest rates and a data-driven approach to monetary policy, this will likely put additional pressure on risk assets.”  Central bankers’ forward guidance has traditionally offered clues about upcoming monetary policy changes, enabling financial markets to prepare, so that they won’t be shocked and make drastic moves.  Prioritizing inflation  Now, the Fed is willing to hurt stocks and other assets, including cryptocurrencies, for the greater good of taming inflation, which Powell reiterated in his speech on Friday at the Fed’s annual Economic Symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Powell’s remarks were praised by some monetary policy observers who were hoping for a clear commitment to address rising prices that could cripple the economy.  “I was actually happy to see how Chair Powell's Jackson Hole speech was received,” Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, told Bloomberg. “People now understand the seriousness of our commitment to getting inflation back down to 2%.”  The Fed’s new level of opacity means that bitcoin traders will have to react to what the Fed does, and that includes studying the same indicators as Fed bankers.  “We're data dependent just like the Fed at the moment,” said Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at Arca, an asset-management firm. That means in the coming weeks, traders will be assessing corporate earnings reports and employment and other economic data.  “Traders are trying to figure out what exactly is the path going forward, and as a result, we probably won’t trade well on every inflation print that comes out that's below expectations,” Dorman said.  Less reliant on Nasdaq  Bitcoin has largely tracked the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index this year, hitting correlation highs in May before plummeting in June and July. After the release earlier this month of minutes from the FOMC's meeting in July that showed the Fed is more inclined to hawkishness, the strong correlation between cryptocurrencies and tech stocks returned for a few days as investors sold risky assets, but the link has subsequently waned.  And Arca’s Dorman said that trend is likely to continue.  “Bitcoin has no cash flow, it hasn't acted as an inflation hedge, it hasn't acted uncorrelated,” he said. “It hasn't done anything that it has been built to do, so until you get a fresh narrative for bitcoin, I think it will continue to lag the market and you're seeing that right.”",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/08/31/more-volatility-ahead-for-bitcoin-as-federal-reserve-keeps-quiet,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6fcfe6fb2852fcf610595cb67a9044861d000b65-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42373930,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvWNCT,1661952528,Bitcoin Miners' Profitability May Narrow as Mining Difficulty Hits Second-Biggest Increase This Year,"The difficulty of mining a bitcoin (BTC) block increased by 9.26% on Wednesday, making it this year's second-biggest increase, which is likely to result in narrower profit margins for the industry.  The metric adjusts automatically to keep the time required to mine a bitcoin block to roughly around 10 minutes, depending on the amount of computing power on the network. The higher the hashrate, the higher the difficulty, which lowers miners' profitability. Earlier this summer, miners across the U.S. and in Texas, a hub for the industry, were curtailing their operations to cope with heatwaves, which contributed to lower difficulty and network hashrate.  Today, the difficulty reached 30.97 trillion as the hashrate hovered over 230 exahash per second (EH/s), according to data from CoinWarz. The difficulty level is just under its all-time high in May of 31.25 trillion, according to data from mining pool BTC.com.  Read more: Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Poised to Spike by Most Since January Amid Colder Weather  As the difficulty increases, miners' profit margins get squeezed because they are less likely to successfully mine a block and reap the rewards. Miners were already feeling the squeeze this year as the price of bitcoin fell more than 50% this year, power prices (a major cost for the miners) increased and raising capital has become very expensive. The increase in difficulty could add more to the miners' woes.  Shares of some of the largest publicly traded bitcoin miners, including Core Scientific (CORZ), Marathon Digital (MARA) and Riot Blockchain (RIOT), have already fallen more than 60% this year.  The hashprice, a metric coined by mining services firm Luxor Technologies that measures revenue per terahash of computing power, has dropped dramatically in the last month and particularly in the past few hours, following the difficulty adjustment. In the month of August, revenue in U.S. dollars per terahash dropped by about 24%, whereas on Wednesday, the hashprice fell by 8%.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING,Eliza Gkritsi,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/08/31/bitcoin-miners-profitability-may-narrow-as-mining-difficulty-hits-second-biggest-increase-this-year,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/aee234db418da001bf5ae613c8da62131873c838-1330x998.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Founded in March 2021, the Los-Angeles based startup wants creators to keep more of their revenue while also accruing ownership of the platform through the native governance token, which is earned through various performance metrics.  “If you actually give creators ownership over the platforms that they helped make valuable, then you really align the incentives of both the platform itself, the developers and the content creators,” Stacked founder and CEO Alex Lin said during an interview with CoinDesk.  Stacked creators can stream gaming content, host watch parties, chat with fans or host lifestyle content. Creators can earn fiat or crypto by accepting donations or subscriptions from viewers. Governance tokens earned can be used to secure a featured spot on the main page and to negotiate a higher cut of revenue.  Investors in the funding round included GFR Fund and Z Venture Capital.

42393779,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpAz3n,1661947200,An NFT Marketplace Is Letting Buyers Avoid Royalty Payments. Creators Aren’t Pleased,"Royalty payments have become a cornerstone of the growing non-fungible token (NFT) industry, allowing artists to make money when people resell their work, venues to capture revenue on secondary marketplaces for NFT tickets and musicians to subvert streaming services in favor of more lucrative, blockchain-driven products.  But there’s a problem: Royalty payments are only enforceable on a marketplace level, and not on-chain. An NFT buyer, for example, could send ether (ETH) to a designated wallet after making an off-chain agreement to buy their NFT, and the seller could send them that NFT with no marketplace as a middleman for the transaction, paying no royalty fees in the process.  Sellers on marketplaces such as OpenSea can program a designated fee into each sale, in most cases between 5%-10% of an item’s purchase price, but if a marketplace wanted to waive the fee altogether, there’s nothing stopping them from doing so.  That’s exactly what’s happened with X2Y2, a popular NFT marketplace that announced on Friday that all royalty payments would be optional, making them the equivalent of a blockchain tip jar.  X2Y2 has been the most popular NFT marketplace by volume in the past week, according to data from NFTGO. It operates similarly to LooksRare, issuing its own token to buyers on the platform to incentivize transactions. It also still charges a 0.5% marketplace fee despite creator-imposed royalties being optional.  X2Y2’s announcement drew backlash from NFT Twitter, with many JPEG enthusiasts arguing that eliminating royalty payments would hurt the very artists and creators who first turned to NFTs as a more profitable medium of selling their work.  The debate around NFT royalties has been especially tense in recent weeks. Prominent digital artists have been weighing their pros and cons in public forums like Twitter, with most agreeing that the consequence of eliminating them altogether could be detrimental to Web3, but also perhaps inevitable without being able to enforce them on-chain.  X2Y2 even admitted that buyers always setting creator royalties to 0% would be a bad thing for the general industry. In a Saturday update in response to the backlash, the marketplace stated that it would be forcing buyers to pay creator royalties on sales of one-of-one (1/1) collectibles. The marketplace is also creating a “holders only” voting system whereby holders will decide as a group whether to enable or disable royalties for specific collections.  In the days since X2Y2 changed its royalty policy, only two Mutant Ape Yacht Club buyers out of 14 have chosen to pay royalty fees back to Yuga Labs, the project’s creator and possibly the most prominent company in NFTs.  Potentially significant consequences  If skirting royalty fees becomes commonplace, the next steps for NFT creators are obvious. Collections will blacklist certain marketplaces in their code to avoid missing out on these fees, ending the era of open marketplace competition that’s done so much to grow the industry in the past two years.  A change in attitude toward fees could also change the way that projects plan to generate revenue. A trend in recent months amid the broader NFT market downturn has been to lower mint prices and raise royalty fees, incentivizing project teams to continue engaging with their communities to earn their keep, as opposed to taking a lump sum off an initial mint.  The most prominent of these projects has been Goblintown, whose NFTs were free to mint but included a hefty 10% royalty fee on every secondary sale. The project’s founding team, Truth Labs, announced on Thursday it would be opening a dedicated marketplace for Goblin NFTs where every secondary sale would only carry a 5% royalty fee instead of 10%.  “I think for projects that have an ecosystem, [dedicated marketplaces] most definitely are the future,” Alexander Taub, co-founder of Truth, the team behind Goblins, told CoinDesk. “If you have multiple collections that are interconnected, then owning that marketplace experience is really important.”  See Also: What Is Sudoswap?

42393790,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpB03L,1661945400,Can Ethereum Out-Engineer the Censors by 'Shuttering' the Beacon Chain?,"In a previous edition of the Valid Points newsletter, we dove headfirst into the debate around censorship on Ethereum. We focused on the role that validators – the computers that propose blocks of transactions on Ethereum’s upcoming proof-of-stake network – might play in censoring transactions.  The censorship debate sprang up in response to the recent U.S. sanctions against Tornado Cash – the Ethereum mixer program used by money launderers and everyday Ethereum users to send and receive money without leaving a clear trail.  In light of concerns that Ethereum’s transactions might be censored, members of the Ethereum community have been discussing ways the core protocol can be engineered to make censorship difficult – or even impossible.  One of the more compelling ideas for how this might work is a “shutterized Beacon Chain” – a proposal that encrypts key transaction details so they cannot be censored by validators. But Martin Köppelmann, the creator of this idea, isn’t so sure that censorship is a problem that the Ethereum community can code its way out of.  This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum’s evolution and its impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  For a community used to engineering its way out of (and into) problems, this may be a hard pill to swallow.  Censorship on Ethereum  The fear two weeks ago was that major validators such as Coinbase (COIN) and Kraken might censor transactions in accordance with U.S. Treasury Dept. sanctions. This potential for censorship was all the more worrisome given that a few validators control a majority of the “stake” (read: power to process transactions) on Ethereum’s soon-to-arrive proof-of-stake network.  But in the last couple of weeks, much has changed.  On the positive side for those opposed to censorship, Coinbase and other big-name validators have clarified their position on how they will handle sanctioned transactions. Most (but not all) responses have echoed that of Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, who says he would sooner end his company’s staking business than succumb to censorship.  But on the negative side, a whole new set of questions has cropped up around whether transactions can be blocked before they are even seen by validators.  These challenges center around MEV-Boost, a piece of middleware that most validators are expected to use come the Merge.  MEV: Maximal extractable value  Before we continue we’ll need to explain one of the critical challenges plaguing Ethereum and other blockchain networks: MEV.  When an Ethereum user issues a transaction, it’s not automatically accepted by the rest of the network. First, it goes to the so-called mempool – a giant bucket of unconfirmed transactions from other Ethereum users.  Recall that a block is just a glorified list of transactions. Validators scan, select and organize mempool transactions into blocks that they propose out to the wider network. If they’re clever, they’ll do this in a way that extracts a bit of extra profit for themselves – a concept called Maximal (or Miner) Extractable Value, or MEV.  Validators aren’t the only actors squeezing out MEV. So-called “searchers” have also emerged – computers that scan the mempool and preview what transactions are upcoming. They then bribe validators (by issuing transactions with a higher fee, or “tip”) to include their own transactions ahead of others that they expect to impact the market.  Read more: Just-In-Time Liquidity: How MEV Can Enhance DeFi on Ethereum  MEV practices range from benign to malicious. On the more malicious end, searchers and validators can use their future-telling abilities to screw over other market participants.  Take sandwich attacks, for example. Say a searcher sees in the mempool that “Bob” is about to buy a bunch of DAI on a particular exchange. The searcher knows that Bob’s transaction will increase the price of DAI, so the searcher buys up a bunch of DAI for itself right before Bob does. Then, after Bob pumps the price of DAI, the searcher dumps the DAI tokens that it just bought while the price was lower.  The searcher, if they are clever, will net out with a profit. Bob, on the other hand, will probably pay a bit extra for DAI as a result of the searcher’s initial purchase. No fun.  MEV-Boost  MEV-Boost makes a bet that MEV, if it can’t be exterminated, can at least be more equitable. Flashbots, its creator, achieves this by separating the actors who build blocks from the validators who propose them out to the wider Ethereum network.  Builders – not validators – do the complicated optimization work of selecting and ordering transactions into blocks in a way that maximizes MEV. If everyone uses MEV-Boost, the thinking goes, then at least everyone will have a fair shot at extracting MEV.  Read more: Are Block Builders the Key to Solving Ethereum’s MEV Centralization Woes?  “Proposer builder separation” will eventually be baked into Ethereum’s core code, but MEV-Boost is a stopgap solution. To make things work, it relies on centralized “relays” to send blocks from builders to proposers.  And this is where the whole issue of censorship comes into play. Flashbots says that its own relay – the default relay that will be shipped with MEV-Boost – will censor transactions in accordance with Tornado Cash sanctions.  Unsurprisingly, the wider Ethereum community was not happy to hear this.  In response to community backlash, the team opted to make open source its relay software earlier than originally planned. This means other parties will be able to set up non-censoring relays when MEV-Boost launches. Validators will have the option of selecting whether they want to use the censored or uncensored relay option.  Even though uncensored relays will be optional, that’s all they’ll be: optional. For anti-censorship hardliners – which includes many of Ethereum’s core developers – this is not enough.  Shutterized Beacon Chain  With all this controversy around censoring validators, relays and software providers emerges a key question: What if censorship could be engineered out of existence?  In a world where “trustlessness” is a core tenet, such a utopian ideal becomes appealing.  Enter, shutterized Beacon Chain.  In a research proposal this past March, authors framed the shutterized Beacon Chain concept as a way to solve the MEV problem.  The proposal introduced a new Ethereum transaction: transactions that are encrypted when they go to the mempool.  Outside of limited information (like the “tip” that a transaction includes for validators to ensure it gets added to a block), other core details – like who is sending a transaction, who is on the receiving end and the quantity of tokens changing hands – are hidden from searchers and block builders.  Only after a transaction is approved and confirmed on-chain will its content become unencrypted.  The idea was originally proposed by Martin Köppelmann, the founder of Gnosis Chain.  “The concept of a shutterized Beacon Chain, in general, is that we separate transaction inclusion from transaction execution,” he explained to CoinDesk. “So you have a period where you blindly include transactions purely … based on whether they are paying a fee, and whether they are paying a high enough fee. If they do, they should be included. That's it.”  It’s obvious why this might be useful from an anti-MEV perspective: If block builders and searchers can’t see a transaction’s payload (meaning what is being paid out to whom), then they won’t have the information that they need to extract MEV. (How can you “front-run” a transaction if you don’t even know what it contains?)  As a side effect, shutterization could play a major role in preventing censorship. Validators and relays won’t know whether to censor a transaction if they can’t see its sender or recipient.  We won’t dive too deeply into the underlying mechanics of the shutterized Beacon Chain concept in this newsletter. Beyond being complicated, the idea hasn’t yet been fully fleshed out on an engineering level (though “shutter” concepts are being built out on Ethereum rollups and other blockchains).  Not so fast …  Köppelmann says the shutterized Beacon Chain concept didn’t gain much attention when it was introduced in March. Partly, he thinks, it was because MEV-extractors – which account for a large portion of the Ethereum community – have profited handsomely from Ethereum’s unencrypted status quo.  When Köppelmann re-pitched the idea around censorship after August’s Tornado Cash sanctions, though, it was received warmly by members of the Ethereum developer community. Some even took the idea further, suggesting that all transactions be shutterized (rather than making it optional, as suggested in the original proposal).  But questions remain: What if governments decide that processing transactions containing sanctioned addresses is illegal regardless of whether those transactions were encrypted when they were picked up by validators? Or what if regulators decide to treat shutterization like Tornado Cash – outlawing a shutterized Beacon Chain entirely?  Despite the recent enthusiasm around his idea, Köppelmann noted in his conversation with CoinDesk that it’s not as if shutterization – or any engineering intervention – can ultimately “solve” Ethereum’s censorship problem.  “I think it's almost always possible, whatever the regulatory challenge is, to find an engineering solution to it. However, I also think that if you always try to find an engineering solution to it – at the end, Ethereum, and crypto, will become extremely niche,” Köppelmann told CoinDesk.  To explain his point, Köppelmann mentioned last week’s news that Hetzner, the cloud service provider that hosts 10% of Ethereum nodes, has banned all crypto-related activity.  “So, of course, now we can come up with an engineering solution that would say, ‘well, stake at home,’” Köppelmann explained. “But next, internet service providers could block traffic that's related to [staking]. Again, you could come up with an engineering solution, but each time you lose a percentage of users. In the end, it becomes this kind of mammoth thing where three guys have a super engineered solution, but still, regulators and broader social consensus could try to force it out of the public.”  In the end, the fight against censorship continues offline – where it is likely to remain.  “I think ultimately, it's always a social kind of fight,” Köppelmann reflected. “I don't want to just find ways to somehow be able to use Tornado; I want to make it socially acceptable to say that Tornado is a valuable thing.”  Pulse check  The following is an overview of network activity on the Ethereum Beacon Chain over the past week.

42373929,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvWNDj,1661943731,Morgan Stanley Says Stablecoin Market Cap Is Contracting Again,"The combined market capitalization of the two largest stablecoins, tether (USDT) and USD coin (USDC), has begun to fall again, a sign that quantitative tightening in the crypto financial system has resumed, Morgan Stanley (MS) said in a research report Tuesday.  The decline in market cap of the two stablecoins, which paused in mid-August, has resumed, the report said. The market cap is now about 10% lower than its April peak.  Availability and demand for stablecoins is an indicator of cryptocurrency market liquidity and the demand for leverage, the bank said. When market capitalization falls it is the crypto equivalent of quantitative tightening. That's the name for when central banks like the U.S. Federal Reserve shrink their balance sheets to remove liquidity from the financial system, seeking to prevent the economy from overheating.  Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency whose value is pegged to another asset, such as the U.S. dollar or gold. They are foundational to the crypto ecosystem, so a reduced supply does suggest tighter financial conditions in the industry – similar to central bank quantitative tightening that shrinks the supply of money in the non-crypto economy.  The bank notes that changes in USDC’s market capitalization appear to be leading bitcoin’s (BTC) price by two months, and says this may be because the stablecoin is used by crypto institutions for borrowing to buy other coins.  Morgan Stanley says it has seen little evidence of leverage building up again in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. DeFi is an umbrella term used for lending, trading and other financial activities carried out on a blockchain without the use of traditional intermediaries.  The crypto market remains highly responsive to expectations for central bank tightening, in particular the actions of the U.S. Federal Reserve, the note added.

42411082,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giBzsb,1661941698,What to Expect From the UK’s Royal Mint NFT Collection,"The U.K. government raised eyebrows in April when a high-ranking official said the country would issue its own non-fungible tokens (NFTs).  Rishi Sunak, the country’s former finance minister, had asked the Royal Mint, the maker of British coins, to develop NFTs to represent the country’s ""forward-looking approach."" But details about what the NFTs would actually be or what they would look like are still lacking.  An NFT is a unique digital token on a blockchain that may be tied to a physical asset such as art. To succeed, however, a government-issued NFT would need to encompass both utility and community, according to industry experts, who said the NFTs could give holders access to events or even a moment with the queen.  The Royal Mint said it is developing a range of NFTs, but didn't comment on whether the tokens would have any other uses. How seriously the U.K. takes crypto is now an open question as a new prime minister is expected to be chosen along with a new cabinet on Sept. 5.  Read more: UK Government Plans to Create an NFT  The price tag  Industry members are divided on how much a Royal Mint NFT should cost.  “Let's charge one for 10 million British pound sterling ($12 million) ... maybe you could get a week's holiday with the queen,” said Neil McFarland, CEO of First Light Games, a U.K.-based NFT and metaverse company. “Don't underestimate the willingness of people to show off their wealth.”  McFarland’s suggestion to charge millions for an NFT isn’t too far from reality. The NFT world is no stranger to grand displays of wealth, and some have sold for millions in the recent past. Pak’s “The Merge” artwork sold for $91.8 million in December making it the most expensive NFT ever sold, with a starting price of $575. Beeple's artwork “Everydays: the First 5000 Days” made history when it sold for $69.3 million in 2021.  The average price of an NFT sale, however, has fallen 16.2% to $415 over the past 12 months, according to data by Nonfungible.  A U.K. government NFT couldn’t solely be for millionaires, because that would exclude the majority of the people in the country. The U.K. could have NFTs targeting different income groups, but even 50 British pound sterling ($58) could be a lot for some people, given how high food and energy prices have become, McFarland said.  “But my question is that are NFTs meant to be used by governments to raise money from their citizens? I’m not sure,” said Gauthier Zuppinger, co-founder of Non Fungible, an NFT data provider.  Utilities and community  Ultimately, utility is important if an NFT is to thrive, Pedro Herrera, senior blockchain analyst at DappRadar, a decentralized application store, told CoinDesk. Popular art NFT collections like the Bored Ape Yacht Club come with some exclusive membership perks such as access to real-world events, limited-edition merchandise and free NFTs.  “How are they going to reward their owners for being part of their collection, of their community?” Herrera asked.  The U.K. government could offer NFTs for specific events, Zuppinger said, or it could also offer discounts for train rides, Herrera said.  For some industry members, the U.K. issuing collectible NFTs without attached utilities would be a good move.  “We've seen the Royal Mint issuing collectible coins for generations, and there's no reason why they shouldn't do the same in an NFT format and embrace a new generation of collectors,” Robby Yung, CEO of Animoca Brands, a venture capital firm for blockchain-based game providers, told CoinDesk.  A collectible NFT could commemorate events like the Queen's Jubilee or be used to redeem a physical coin, Yung said. Collectible coins by the Royal Mint range from 20 to 10,165 British pound sterling ($23-$11,838.62).  Community is another factor that is important for a successful NFT, but the wider U.K. population may not understand enough about NFTs to engage with them properly, Zuppinger said.  The process is long, requiring users to create a digital wallet and safely store their private keys. Not everyone is ready for decentralization, Zuppinger said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Camomile Shumba,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/08/31/what-to-expect-from-the-uks-royal-mint-nft-collection,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c5233fd6fe1df1f3541430cf6488448036287b7c-2880x2160.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

U.K. District Judge Nicholas Rimmer rejected Hamilton's plea that he should be tried in the country since the fraud he committed occurred outside the U.S.  ""Wherever victims are based, it is in their interests for perpetrators involved to be prosecuted rather than not to be,” Judge Rimmer wrote, according to Law360. “This factor weighs in favor of extradition.”  The extradition may not be final if Hamilton decides to file an appeal. Additionally, the case will now be sent to the Secretary of State for a final decision.  Robert McDonald, a co-accused, avoided extradition on human rights grounds. McDonald is the prime care giver for his ""extremely ill"" wife and has expressed ""clear and genuine suicidal intent, in the event he were to be extradited,"" according to the judgment cited in the Law360 report. The judge also stated that ""there is no apparent evidence of monetary gain by Robert MacDonald.""  Hamilton and McDonald are accused of laundering $105 million of the $4 billion global scam, which was perpetrated by fugitive ""CryptoQueen"" Ruja Ignatova.

The 30% drop in the ETH prices takes a bullish reversal from the $1400 support level resulting in a 12% recovery in the last four days.

Key Points: The ETH prices revert by 12% from the $1400 support level. The reversal rally may shortly give a bullish breakout of the resistance trendline.

The recent bullish reversal starting after the bullish engulfing candle of 8.99% on 29th August challenges the resistance trend line and a 50-day SMA. However, the higher price reduction in the daily candle delays the breakout entry for sideline traders. The reversal rally finds the support of the increased intraday trading volume supporting the possibility of a bullish breakout.

Shah, the former head of asset management sales at JPMorgan (JPM) and a 12-year veteran at the bank, joined Pantera at the start of July, CoinDesk reported. He said at the time he was “excited to partner with Dan Morehead, Joey Krug and the broader Pantera team to help take the organization to new heights!”  He left this month, his profile shows. There’s no indication he has taken on a new position.  Pantera Capital, the crypto venture capital and hedge fund helmed by Dan Morehead, is having a rocky couple of months as far as resignations go. Last month, legal counsel Joe Cisewski left to become chief of staff to Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Commissioner Christie Goldsmith Romero.  Pantera has some $5.8 billion in assets under management and counts the likes of exchanges Coinbase (COIN), FTX and stablecoin builder Circle among its investments.

The BTC prices maintain a declining trend, leading to a bearish wedge pattern in the daily chart. Currently, the bull cycle within the bearish pattern increases the possibility of a bullish breakout with the support of the technical indicators. So, should you consider buying Bitcoin at the $20K mark? Key Points: The BTC prices maintain a sideways trend at the $20,000 mark.

Korean City Busan Taps FTX to Develop Crypto Exchange, Promote Blockchain Businesses","South Korean port city Busan signed an agreement with crypto exchange FTX to develop blockchain-based businesses in the coming months.  This move is in line with the city’s broader plans to become a global blockchain and financial hub. Busan City and FTX will work together to develop and promote various blockchain-focused businesses and establish the Busan Digital Asset Exchange, as per a release by the Busan Metropolitan City department on Tuesday morning.  FTX would further develop and promote blockchain-specialized education in connection with regional universities and launch projects in the Busan blockchain special free zone.  Busan had previously tapped crypto exchange Binance to build specialized blockchain products and developer the Busan Digital Asset Exchange, as reported.  Mayor Park Hyung-jun said he “will not stop” in efforts to make Busan a blockchain hub. “With this agreement, we will help establish the Busan Digital Asset Exchange and secure a new growth engine for the local economy,” he said.  The special zone has built several blockchain-based products and applications for use by the general public. These include B Pass, a blockchain-based ID service, Busan Digital Voucher, a local currency circulation-boosting service based on its digital ledger, the Citizen Safety Report, and B-Fresh, a seafood logistics service.  However, a CoinDesk visit to Busan’s blockchain center in August revealed that the city's blockchain hub team was less than five employees working out of a shared office space.

Bitcoin responded in concert with other riskier assets by spending most of Tuesday on its heels before rallying later in the day.  The largest cryptocurrency by market value was recently changing hands over $20,000, down about 1% over the past 24 hours. BTC has been struggling to hold this psychologically important threshold as investors fret over continued U.S. Federal Reserve monetary hawkishness tied at least partly to a historically low unemployment rate.  ""Risk aversion is firmly back in place, and that sent bitcoin below the $20,000 level,"" Oanda Senior Market Analyst Edward Moya wrote in an email, noting that if the current ""broad sell-off"" of stocks ""intensifies, bitcoin could be vulnerable.  ""If the S&P declines by 3% over the next few days, that could be the catalyst to send bitcoin back toward the June lows,"" Moya wrote.  Ether was recently trading near $1,600, a roughly 3% gain over the past 24 hours after the second-largest crypto in market value also rallied late. ETH been struggling to hold support above $1,500 for the past few days. Most other cryptos in the CoinDesk top 20 spent much of the day in the red. Popular meme coin DOGE and DOT were recently off more than 2% and 1%, respectively. Trading volume was tepid compared to a week ago.  ""Retail traders sentiment is very weak,"" Rosh Singh, co-founder and CEO of Quadency, told CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program. ""A lot of retail traders are platform-focused on retail traders. So we're seeing very weak activity as of late which could indicate that we're bottoming out soon.""  Equity markets dipped for a third straight day amid the looming prospect of a third consecutive 75 basis-point interest rate hike. The tech-heavy Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) all fell about 1%. The U.S. Labor Department's latest employment report showing 11.2 million job openings in July, offered the latest evidence of a relentlessly upbeat job market at odds with other economic indicators showing the economy in contraction.  ""This is one critical component of the labor market that will help the Fed justify aggressive rate hikes,"" Moya wrote of Tuesday's Labor Department report.  One sliver of good news: The Conference Board’s August consumer confidence index rose after three consecutive, monthly declines, surging to an unexpectedly high 103.2 reading, up from 95.3 in July and above the median forecast of 98 from a Bloomberg survey of economists. Buoyed perhaps by falling gas prices and abundant jobs, consumers said they were more confident about business prospects in six months, the time frame upon which the report considers.  Regulation assumed at least part of the crypto news spotlight on Tuesday with CoinDesk reporting that FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried and his government relations and policy team had visited members of the Biden administration in May amid the ongoing debate in Congress about whether the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) or the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) should serve as the crypto industry's primary federal market regulator.  Meanwhile, Barclays (BCS) analyst Benjamin Budish initiated coverage of crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) with an equal weight rating and $80 price target, although he also noted the threats of regulatory risk and exposure to retail trading revenue.  Quadency's Singh called $19,800 ""a key support resistance level.""  ""If it were to be breached, we could be seeing $14,000,"" he said, but noted optimistically ""that's probably unlikely as we are also seeing strong fundamentals from the miner side. Miner outflows are on two-year lows right now. And the hash rate continues to climb up.""  He added: ""If bitcoin holds the $19,800 level, we could see it go up to $30K.""

A recent address by Ravi Menon, the authority’s managing director, solidified this stance: ""Yes to digital asset innovation, no to cryptocurrency speculation.”  Digital asset innovation in the eyes of MAS means things like security token offerings (STO) and tokenized bonds. During his address, which attempted to clarify the sovereign island nation’s stance on digital assets, Menon listed a number of key projects where the bank has engaged institutional stakeholders to build out offerings.  To be sure, the digitization of traditional financial vehicles through blockchain and digital ledger technology (DLT) provides a long list of benefits. The problem is that despite the endorsement of Singapore’s regulator, these offerings aren’t hitting their stride because regulations are holding them back.  Remember, none of this is institutional crypto; DBS has a desk for that, as does OSL. This is all about using blockchain technology to emulate traditional financial products.  Regulated digital asset offerings by their nature need to be geographically locked off and restricted to institutional investors. While the back end of these products is improved, they still access the same capital pools, maybe even smaller, that traditional financial products use.  A lack of regulation  Alessio Quaglini, CEO of Hex Trust, a Hong Kong-based crypto custodian, told CoinDesk in an email that investors have remained cool to STOs. Quaglini’s position is unchanged since an interview last year when he also noted little interest in this type of investment. He blames the lack of crypto-native regulation for this trend.  “The main issue is the regulatory framework, which still doesn’t exist or is too fragmented,” he said via email.  Aside from the fact that markets close by 5 p.m. to mark the close of business, Quaglini says that they are already efficient.  “I believe the first security token type of initiatives will come from synthetics listed on crypto exchanges,” he said, referring to a specific token type that’s effectively a representation of another asset like a stock, bond or commodity future.  FTX launched something like this with tokenized stocks earlier this year.  DBS didn’t respond to CoinDesk’s request for comment. All the trading takes place behind virtual closed doors on the DBS Digital Exchange using permissioned blockchains. On-chain data isn’t available as it would be for normal, public chains.  Until there is regulation that is written with crypto in mind, and doesn't try to apply securities laws from the last century to this asset class, STOs remain a big yawn. MAS’ Menon also said in his speech that a retail crypto ban would be impossible to enforce. So why not just regulate retail crypto instead of trying to manufacture something in which the market only has mild interest?  Important events  9 a.m. HKT/SGT(1 a .m.

This involves the activities of miners that utilize special mining machines and electricity to operate Bitcoin nodes. Over the years, mining attracted different miners when BTC prices were high. However, the BTC mining difficulty and the network hash rate have their role to play in block rewards. From a recent report, the BTC mining difficulty is about to hit a new 7-month high this week.
