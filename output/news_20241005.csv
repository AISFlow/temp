34358181,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=646362,1728171028,Chainlink (LINK) Bullish Pattern Could Ignite A Breakout: Analyst Sets $15 Target,"Chainlink is currently trading in a bullish pattern that has been developing for at least seven months, capturing the attention of analysts and investors alike. Many are eagerly anticipating Chainlink to surge during this cycle and finally reclaim new all-time highs. The extended consolidation phase has kept traders on edge, as they await a significant breakout. Related Reading: XRP Price Bullish Potential Grows – A Surge Above $0.65 Will Trigger Buyers Renowned crypto analyst Lucky has shared an insightful prediction regarding Chainlink’s potential trajectory. According to Lucky, the key lies in LINK breaking above its current consolidation range, which would set the stage for a strong upward move. He suggests that once this breakout occurs, Chainlink could quickly surge toward a short-term target of $15. With bullish sentiment building around this major resistance level, Chainlink’s price action in the coming days could be crucial in determining its direction. Investors are closely monitoring the market, watching for signals that LINK is ready to break free from its long-standing range and enter a new phase of growth. Chainlink Price Action Turning Bullish Chainlink’s price action has been largely bearish since hitting its yearly high in March, with the asset now stuck in a prolonged consolidation phase. However, many analysts believe this consolidation could be nearing its end. One top analyst, Lucky, has recently shared a bullish technical analysis on X, offering an optimistic outlook for Chainlink. Lucky’s analysis reveals that LINK is trading within a falling wedge pattern, a formation often associated with potential bullish reversals. According to his chart, Chainlink has touched the lower boundary of this wedge three times, signaling strong support, and now appears to be gearing up for a breakout from its yearly consolidation range. He predicts that this breakout could happen as early as October, potentially triggering a surge in LINK’s price. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Holds Above $140 As Funding Rate Signals Bullish Momentum Lucky has set several bullish price targets once Chainlink breaks out of this consolidation phase. The first target is $15, followed by more ambitious targets at $19 and $22. These price levels would represent significant gains from Chainlink’s current price and mark a strong recovery from the bearish trend that has dominated most of 2024. With bullish patterns emerging, investors are closely watching for Chainlink’s next move, anticipating that a major breakout could propel LINK toward these optimistic price targets. Technical Analysis: Key Prices To Watch Chainlink (LINK) is currently trading at $11.09 and is testing a key resistance level, the 4-hour 200 moving average (MA) at $11.10, after a 7% surge since Thursday. This level has become a significant hurdle for bulls, as the price has struggled to break above the indicator. For the bullish momentum to continue, LINK must push past this indicator and aim for higher supply zones around $13. However, the current price action suggests that bulls are finding it difficult to gain strength at this critical level. Should LINK fail to break above $11.10 and reclaim the higher resistance, a correction may follow. In that scenario, the price could dip to a lower demand zone, with the next key support level at $9.2. Related Reading: Can SUI Break Past $2 Resistance? On-Chain Metrics Reveal Growing Demand The coming days will likely determine whether LINK can maintain its upward trajectory or see a pullback in price. A successful breakout above the 4-hour 200 MA could signal further gains, while failing to do so may result in a bearish correction.

Investors are feeling optimistic as a result of this level of activity. From the initial supply, 410.73 trillion SHIB tokens have so far been destroyed. The amount of tokens in circulation, at 583.51 trillion, is still substantial. The SHIB community is still upbeat that the meme coin will exceed expectations and perform well in the upcoming weeks, or months. Santana’s assessment indicates that the present weak market, particularly the growing turmoil in the Middle East, may cause some disruptions. However, investors shouldn’t worry too much as cryptocurrencies can sometimes bring big surprises. Many people are keeping a close watch on this since the Shiba Inu community is working together to limit the supply. Does the price appreciation for SHIB have anything to do with the current rush to burn? Investors hold their breath and hope for a breakout as the year 2025 approaches.

34353497,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=646367,1728160209,"Ethereum ICO Participant Offloads 6,000 ETH As Bearish Sentiment Intensifies","According to data from CoinMarketCap, the price of Ethereum slipped by 10.23% over the last seven days in line with the general market negative movement. This crypto market downturn has been attributed to multiple factors including heightened geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and rising liquidations of long positions. While Ethereum has experienced some rebound in the last day gaining by 3.21%, investors remain uncertain of a full price recovery with bearish sentiments raving through the market. Notably, an Ethereum ICO participant has now sold off a substantial amount of ETH intensifying concerns of a prolonged downward trend. Related Reading: Ethereum At Risk Of Further Decline: Top Investor Sets $2,150 Target If Support Breaks Ethereum ICO Wallet Continues Selling Spree, Offloads 40,000 ETH In Two Weeks According to data from blockchain analytics firm, Lookonchain, an Ethereum wallet with the address “0xBF4” moved 6,000 ETH worth $14.11 million to the Kraken exchange on Friday. So far, the address has been identified as an early Ethereum investor who acquired 150,000 ETH valued at $368 million in the asset’s initial coin offering (ICO) in 2014. Data from Lookonchain highlights this is the second ETH sale by “0xBF4” in the last week after the ICO participant initially sold 19,000 ETH, valued at $47.54 million over Wednesday and Thursday. Notably, this ETH whale has transferred out 40,000 ETH worth $101 million since September 22, holding a balance of 99,500 ETH valued at $238 million. Generally, massive token offloads by large holders e.g. whales are interpreted as bearish signals as they indicate a lack of confidence in the asset’s long-term profitability. Sales such as those seen from “0xBF4” may trigger a panic selling from smaller investors inducing a stronger downward pressure on Ethereum’s price. Related Reading: Crypto Capo Returns After 2 Months To Predict Ethereum Decline To $1,800, Is It Time To Go Long? 108,000 ETH Moved To Exchanges In 24 Hours Aside from the wallet address “0xBF4”, other investors have recently sold off large amounts of ETH. According to analyst Ali Martinez, 108,000 ETH valued at $259.2 million have been transferred to exchanges in the last day. This massive sale activity indicates a heightened sentiment in the ETH market. Currently, Ethereum trades at $2,399 following its recent price rally. However, its daily trading volume has declined by 17.48% and is valued at $14.61 billion. If bearish sentiments persist, ETH could retrace to around $2,200 at which lies its next significant price level. However, amidst massive selling pressure, the altcoin could trade as low as $1,600. With a market cap of $291.40 billion, Ethereum continues to rank as the second largest cryptocurrency, with a market dominance of 13.47%.

This bearish pressure is believed to have been triggered by the escalating tension in the Middle East after Iran fired missiles into Israel. However, the premier cryptocurrency seems to be making a turnaround to close the week, bouncing back above $62,000 on Friday. The latest on-chain observation shows that this latest recovery seen with the Bitcoin price is connected to dwindling selling pressure. 4,000 Long Positions Liquidated On October 1 — What Next? In a new Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, an analyst with the pseudonym Caueconomy discussed the impact of the recent liquidations of long positions in the Bitcoin futures market. According to the analyst, the ongoing liquidations have reduced the bearish pressure on the Bitcoin price. Related Reading: Meme Coin Trader Misses A $25 Million Payout After Selling HIPPO On Sui Network Early For context, futures allow investors to speculate on the price of a specific asset (Bitcoin, in this scenario). A long position is taken when a BTC trader buys a futures contract, predicting the coin’s price to rise at a later date. The trader incurs a loss when the asset’s price falls below the purchase price specified in the futures contract. According to data from CryptoQuant, more than 4,000 long positions were liquidated following the latest price decline on Tuesday, October 1, representing the second-largest liquidation event so far this year. Although liquidations reflect significant selling activity and investor losses, they can also signal pivotal shifts in market sentiment. The CryptoQuant analyst noted that periods of severe losses and market liquidations often lead to the formation of local price bottoms. “During significant price declines, the number of contracts purchased tends to drop sharply due to liquidations, which reduces selling pressure in the market,” Caueconomy said. Furthermore, the analyst mentioned that the price of Bitcoin might be gearing up for a short-term recovery due to the reduced selling pressure. However, Caueconomy highlighted the importance of increasing buying strength from the investors for the Bitcoin price to make a full comeback. Bitcoin Price At A Glance It does appear like the price of Bitcoin established a local bottom around the psychological $60,000 level before a pivotal rebound. As of this writing, the premier cryptocurrency trades around the $62,000 mark, reflecting an over 2.5% increase in the past day. Related Reading: FET At Risk Of Further Decline?

These whales likely believe that the bull is far from over, which is why they haven’t secured as much profit as they have done in previous bull runs. Bitcoin Whales Have Taken Lesser Profits In This Market Cycle Than Past Ones Ki Young Ju mentioned in an X post that if the Bitcoin bull cycle were to end here, it would mean that Bitcoin whales have just set the record for the least profit-taking across all cycles ever. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez tried to counter Ki Young Ju’s point by highlighting how these whales have been distributing their BTC across different addresses, leading to a drop in the number of addresses holding between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC. Related Reading: ‘FLOKI Master Plan’: Crypto Analyst Predicts 2,000% Jump For The Shiba Inu Competitor However, the CryptoQuant founder claimed that this is still the lowest return rate across all cycles, no matter how much these whales sold through those different wallets. He also revealed that the whales that are selling now are doing so with little profit, suggesting that they are likely new whales with weak hands. Meanwhile, Ki Young Ju noted that the type of transactions that Martinez alluded to cannot always be considered as sales. He remarked that one must look at more macro-level aggregated data, such as historical realized profit, rather than just transactions to get the bigger picture. These whales are believed to be holding back on taking profits just yet, considering that the bull run looks to be far from over. The CryptoQuant CEO also mentioned earlier that Bitcoin was still in the middle of a bull run based on the market cap to realized cap metric. Instead of taking profits, these Bitcoin whales are still accumulating more BTC ahead of the next leg of the bull run. CryptoQuant recently revealed that there has been a surge in the outflows from exchanges, the largest since November 2022. Meanwhile, Ki Young Ju also noted that new whales are accumulating at a rate the market has never witnessed before. When Is This Market Cycle Expected To Peak? Crypto analysts like Rekt Capital have predicted that the Bitcoin market top could occur sometime in mid-September or mid-October 2025. However, in a recent report, CoinMarketCap offered a different opinion, predicting that the cycle top could potentially be between mid-May and mid-June 2025. Related Reading: Analyst Says PEPE Bearish Continuation Is Possible For A 50% Price Crash The platform noted that Bitcoin is currently ahead of historical trends, especially considering that it hit a new all-time high (ATH) before the Halving event.

34346666,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=646379,1728144035,Bitcoin Whales Set Profit-Taking Record In Bull Cycle — What’s Happening?,"The price of Bitcoin has not had the most straightforward performance in 2024 despite a strong start to the year. The flagship cryptocurrency has spent most of the last two quarters in consolidation, fluctuating within the $50,000 and $70,000 range. This uninspiring performance has sparked conversations about the current cycle, with several analysts and experts predicting whether the bull run is still on. Amongst the latest to comment is the CryptoQuant CEO, who offered an interesting on-chain insight into the cycle. Why Are Whales Taking Less Profit This Cycle? In a post on the X platform, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju revealed that the Bitcoin whales have held onto their assets this cycle. As a result, the large investors have set the record for the least profit-taking compared to other cycles if the current bull run ends now. Related Reading: XRP Macro Charts Signal Explosive Bullish Move Despite SEC Appeal: Analyst This on-chain revelation is based on the Realized Profit Ratio by Balance Cohort metric, which measures the ratio of coins sold at a profit by an investor class relative to the total coins sold at a given time. It basically evaluates the profitability of different cohorts of Bitcoin holders. Typically, when the Realized Profit Ratio of whales is high, it implies that a sell-off is likely ongoing, with the large investors believing that prices have peaked. On the other hand, a low Realized Profit Ratio often indicates a low level of profit-taking, meaning that investors are not cutting their losses or expecting further price gains. The current on-chain data points to a trend where the large holders have taken the least amount of profits across any bull cycle. This could mean that the Bitcoin whales still have faith in Bitcoin’s long-term potential. Ultimately, this suggests that the current bull run is far from the end, and there is the possibility of the Bitcoin price uptrend resuming. Bitcoin ‘Dolphin’ Addresses On The Rise Again: Santiment In a post on X, Santiment revealed that the Bitcoin’s “Dolphin” cohort, holding between 0.1 to 10 BTC, have been growing steadily over the past few months. The analytics reported that this tier of investors mostly sold for profit in the first half of the year. However, addresses holding between 0.1 and 10 BTC have been on the rise since early July. Specifically, the 0.1 – 1 BTC wallets have increased by 25,671 more addresses, while the 1 – 10 BTC wallets have climbed by about 4,000 addresses. Related Reading: Analyst Says Bitcoin Crash Might Not Be Over, Why $60,365 Is Important This indicates that small-scale investors might be returning to the market, which could be positive for the Bitcoin price over the coming months.

34344417,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=646357,1728138647,Can SUI Fall To $1.40? On-Chain Data Exposes Declining Demand,"SUI is currently testing a crucial supply zone following a massive 95% surge triggered by the Federal Reserve’s recent interest rate cut announcement. The explosive rally, driven by significant buying pressure, has led to volatile price action, raising questions about whether this upward momentum can be sustained. As SUI hovers near its current highs, market speculation is increasing around the possibility of a correction to lower demand levels, with $1.40 being the key target. Related Reading: Solana ‘In Serious Danger’ If $137 Support Breaks – Analyst Shares Targets Key data from Coinglass reveals a decline in market demand, signaling a potential slowdown in buying activity. This has left some investors on edge, as they anticipate a price drop in the coming days. The sudden surge has fueled both optimism and caution as traders weigh the potential for continued gains against the risk of a sharp reversal. With SUI now at a critical juncture, the next few days will be pivotal in determining whether the bullish trend can continue or if the market will retrace to more stable demand levels. Investors are watching closely, ready to adjust their strategies based on the unfolding price action. SUI Funding Rate Signals Price Drop SUI is at a critical point after days of extreme price action and significant gains. Following its impressive 95% rally since the Federal Reserve’s interest rate cut announcement, some investors and traders are beginning to take profits, signaling a potential shift in market sentiment. Many now view a correction to $1.40 as inevitable, especially as buying pressure cools down. Key data from Coinglass suggests a cooling demand, with the funding rate turning negative to -0.067, marking a yearly low. The funding rate is a key indicator in futures trading, representing the periodic payment between traders in long positions (betting on price increases) and those in short positions (betting on price declines). When an asset’s funding rate turns negative, it indicates that more traders are opening short positions, expecting a drop in price. This shift reflects growing caution in the market as traders start positioning themselves for a potential downturn. Related Reading: Ethereum At Risk Of Further Decline: Top Investor Sets $2,150 Target If Support Breaks With the funding rate at such a low and demand waning, the market is showing signs of cooling off after SUI’s explosive September rally. As a result, investors and traders are now patiently waiting for a correction to lower demand levels around $1.40, which could present new buying opportunities or signal further declines depending on the broader market conditions. Key Levels To Watch SUI is currently trading at $1.73 after experiencing days of volatile price action. The price surged but halted at the crucial $2 resistance level and has since entered a consolidation phase just below it. This key level has become a barrier for bulls, and a push above $2 is necessary for SUI to regain momentum and confirm a bullish trend. However, the market remains uncertain, and if the price fails to hold the $1.60 support level, a deeper correction could follow. Analysts predict that a break below $1.60 may lead to a 20% drop, bringing SUI down to the $1.40 demand zone. This level is being closely monitored by investors and traders as a critical support to prevent further downside pressure.

Please note that VanEck may have a position(s) in the digital asset(s) described below. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) reacted strongly to the Fed's rate cut and China's stimulus, rallying 7.7% and beating Gold (+5%), Ethereum ( ETH-USD )(+3.2%), MSCI ACWI (+2.3%) and the S&P (+1.7%). Bitcoin ETP buyers returned, with US versions attracting $1.2B in net inflows, a substantial rebound from August's negative number and not far from the monthly average of $2B. Cumulatively, the US ETFs have bought more Bitcoin than has been mined since their launch, which makes them very important to price formation. We will have more on this topic in an upcoming ChainCheck . Notably, Bitcoin's daily correlation with the Nasdaq is back to late 2023 levels, above 0.62 on a 30-day average. Allocators may want to see this fall before getting more aggressive. Memecoins paced gains +31%, while DeFi +19%, Layer 1s +11%, and crypto equities +11%. ETH continued to lag +3%, reflecting market share loss and much lower fee generation. However, ETH's market share appears to have bottomed mid-month at 5-year lows. Concurrently, Bitcoin Dominance rose to a 4-year high of 59% before slipping slightly. We remind readers that Bitcoin dominance peaked last cycle right after the election, at 70%, before falling back to 62% by the end of 2020. We think a Kamala Harris victory could produce a different outcome, challenging the pattern seen in the last cycle.

Up-tober arrived early this year on the back of positive macro developments and an increase in on-chain activity. Across L1s, transaction activity increased (+3.5%) with Ethereum recapturing significant market share, from (31%) of total SCP fee revenues in August to (45%) in September. This came at the same time as Solana's ( SOL-USD ) revenues collapsed, spurred by a collapse (-75%) in memecoin activity, from (24%) of all SCP revenues in July to (10%) in September. While DEX volumes for all SCPs were down slightly month on month (-1.5%), the count of Daily Active Addresses (DAAs) was up (+28%) from August's average. Daily Active Addresses also reached a new all-time high of around 18.1M on September 12, 2024. Though DAAs is an imperfect proxy for usership due to the ability of people to control many wallets, monitoring DAAs still is valuable when it is triangulated with other metrics. Fee Market Share: ETH, TRX, BTC, SOL, BNB Source: TokenTerminal as of 9/27/24. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. On-chain liquidity, as measured by the market capitalization of stablecoins for cryptocurrencies, has reached $172.5B which is $3B more than at the start of September and $32.5B more than at the beginning of 2024. However, most likely tied to the decline in DEX volumes and CEX Volumes (-20%), average daily stablecoin transfer volumes dropped from $58B per day in August to $50B per day in September. Stablecoins on the Rise Interest in stablecoins continued to grow in September as Sony Bank and Revolut announced they will launch stablecoins. Meanwhile, Blackrock partnered with stablecoin issuer Ethena to create a new stablecoin, called UStB backed by Blackrock's onchain BUIDL treasury fund. Following Ethena's earlier launch of a stablecoin backed by derivative positions on ETH, the large crypto market maker DWF will debut its own synthetic stablecoin as early as 4Q2024. Circle announced that its stablecoin USDC is now available for usage in Brazil and Mexico. Ripple claims that its own stablecoin will first appear over the coming weeks. Meanwhile, VanEck-backed Agora Finance, 1 with its AUSD offering, continued strong growth with $60M in AUM and onchain trading volumes exceeding $500M since launch. The rush to create new stablecoins backed by fiat assets and short-term debt has been gaining momentum as more financial institutions recognize their potential. Stablecoins began in earnest with the introduction of Tether ( USDT-USD ) in 2014 and initially found usage quickly routing liquidity between crypto exchanges to rectify interexchange pricing disparities. The market capitalization of stablecoins has grown roughly 39x since 2020 which compares to 8x for that of BTC. The vast majority of stablecoins, more than (99%) by supply, are pegged to the US dollar. Additionally, (~93%), are backed by fiat assets like cash deposits, repurchase agreements and short-term US treasury debt. Stablecoins are now the base pair for most of cryptocurrency trading on both centralized (CEXes) and decentralized exchanges (DEXes). For example, (87%) of Binance's trading volumes are based in either FDUSD, USDT, or USDC. The business model of the stablecoin issuer is to partner with entities that can attract usage demand such as crypto exchanges, blockchains, and dApps. These partnerships involve the sharing of revenues that stablecoins generate on the assets backing their assets with the partners that bring new holders. For example, Coinbase ( COIN ), which is a distribution partner of Circle's USDC, receives roughly (50%) of Circle's revenues. Due to the sizable revenue opportunities and disputes over value add, stablecoins firms and their partners often have a tenuous relationship. Recently, Binance again reassessed its partnership with Tether's USDT and instead chose to back FDUSD on Binance's exchange. To direct trading to FDUSD, Binance offered free trading on BTC, ETH and Binance's four other highest volume spot tokens if traders employed FDUSD. The result was that trading in Binance's flagship product, BTC, went from being based in USDT in 99% of trades in the month prior to FDUSD's debut in September 2023, to roughly 40% afterwards.

Notable Performers - Sui, Solana and Aptos Sui, Aptos and Solana DAAs Are Up 984% Since Jan 2024 Source: Artemis XYZ as of 9/26/2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. So-called ""monolithic"" blockchains, which bundle consensus, execution, and data availability layers into a single protocol stack, outperformed in September, especially Sui ( SUI-USD ) whose SUI token was up (+118%) to reach $5B market cap. Sui also saw strength in active addresses (+140%) and revenues (+48%) compared to August. The biggest driver of activity on Sui has been memecoin speculation and the introduction of native stablecoins like AUSD and USDC. Sui is a project we closely watch due to its unique object-based architecture that supports higher throughput of transactions and lower latency than competitors like Solana and Ethereum. If we are to segment our investment theses on Layer-1 blockchains, we put Sui in the camp with Solana and Aptos ( APT-USD ) as chains that are leveraging their high-performance characteristics to appeal to Web2 developers. Solana (+14%) and Aptos (+23%) also outperformed in September. In late September, Solana supporters gathered for Solana's annual conference in Singapore. Among the most impactful announcements was the release of the much anticipated ""Frankendancer"" on Solana Mainnet and stand-up of ""Firedancer"" on Solana testnet. Both of the ""Dancers"" are new upgrades to Solana's core software which will enable Solana to process more transactions. The Dancers are a series of progressive implementations with Frankendancer launched first to incorporate some of Firedancer's early features. Firedancer claims to be able to scale Solana transactions throughput by a factor of 20x while also making the blockchain, known for days of downtime a few years back, more reliable. Thus far, it has been able to achieve 89k TPS on testnet. The leader of Solana, Anatoly Yakovenko, is so confident in Firedancer's breakthrough capabilities that he has announced he will remove Solana's ""Beta"" tag once Firedancer is implemented. Aptos had a strong September despite a ~11M ($90.2M) token unlock, an (-8%) decline in fee revenue, and a (-2%) drop in DEX volumes. The main price catalyst for Aptos was the upgrade to Aptos's core software called Raptr that helped attract a (+30%) MtM increase in DAAs. Expected to launch in ""the near future,"" Aptos claims its end-to-end finality could be as low as 800ms while supporting ""much higher throughput."" This compares to the current Solana finality of ~2-3s while putting it on par with Sui's which is currently around 800ms. We are excited to see more specific details of the upgrade in an upcoming whitepaper release. While the improvements in Aptos's technology is laudable, for Aptos's APT token to work, it will need to marry its advanced capabilities with compelling, novel use cases that summon new users to its blockchain. As this has not occurred yet; Aptos's share of Sui/Solana/Aptos's userbase has fallen from (12%) at the start of 2024, to (5%) today. Ethereum's Gambit and L1 Token Value ETH's (+14%) Return is ~1/3rd that of BTC's (+44%) in 2024 Source: Artemis XYZ as of 9/27/2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. ETH is up (+14%) YTD, but it's trailing behind BTC (+49%) and SOL (+52%). The catalyst? EIP-4844, implemented on March 13, 2024, which shifted Ethereum's economic model. EIP-4844 created a separate transaction layer for Layer-2 (L2) blockchains to post data cheaply, drastically reducing their demand for Ethereum's blockspace. Previously, L2s accounted for 20% of Ethereum's blockspace usage-now, that demand has evaporated. The result? A collapse in Ethereum's transaction prices. Annual revenues plummeted from $7.2B in March to just $1.2B in September. Net ETH emissions flipped from deflationary (-1.15%) to inflationary (+0.34%)-more supply, less demand. This shift is directly tied to ETH's underperformance. Ethereum made this move to expand its blockspace capacity for mass adoption, following a strategy similar to Solana's low-cost blockspace model. But for short-term investors, reducing Ethereum's ""take rate"" killed the narrative of ETH as a deflationary, dividend-like asset. EIP-4844 isn't just a tactical shift; it fundamentally alters Ethereum's business model. Before, ETH generated revenue by monetizing transaction activity (base fees, priority fees, MEV fees). It charged users to access blockspace and positioned transactions within each block. Now, Ethereum aims to become a settlement and data availability layer for its L2s. Ethereum's long-term vision assumes that L2s will scale to millions of users, paying ETH for settlement. This creates a system where L2s charge their customers in ETH, fueling the asset's value. Ethereum's core believers argue that this makes ETH ""money."" While ETH can be money within Ethereum's ecosystem, it only holds value if L2s remain ""Ethereum aligned."" So far, Ethereum hasn't enforced any real alignment, making this framework feel more like a loose confederacy. The pact between Ethereum and its L2s could break if the economics shift. L2s are closer to end users, and historically, the closer you are to the user, the more valuable the business. If L2 ecosystems gain enough momentum and applications, they might leave Ethereum altogether to capture the monetary premium for themselves. This leads to a critical question: what drives the value of a blockchain like Ethereum or Solana? Blockchains compete on three fronts: Economic value of blockspace Liveness (the guarantee to transact) Safety (the security of balances) Ethereum's strategy is to dominate on liveness and safety, leaving economic value to L2s. With $90B in locked value and 1M validators, Ethereum positions itself as the champion of ""immutable property rights,"" guaranteeing that users' assets remain secure and usable. Meanwhile, Solana and other monolithic chains are laser-focused on maximizing their Layer-1 (L1) economic value. These competitors have dedicated business development teams onboarding new projects, prioritizing users and applications. As Solana's economic value grows, security and liveness tend to follow, attracting more validators to the network. Solana is also scaling usability-offering 1,000x more transaction throughput than Ethereum's L1 with lower latency. This allows Solana to serve a larger user base directly with better app interoperability, where SOL remains the only form of money. So, Solana binds users directly, while ETH relies on intermediaries (L2s) for value accrual. Despite its current struggles, Ethereum's long-term vision still holds potential. Ethereum's robust censorship resistance (liveness) and security provide stronger property rights than Solana, making it a more permissionless and secure platform. Ethereum can still outcompete Web2 platforms that take massive fees (30%+). Most importantly, Ethereum can still control its own destiny. Developers could force L2s to implement ""based sequencers,"" requiring validators to hold ETH for transaction sequencing. Ethereum could offer stronger guarantees like faster finality for L2s that remit more value to the main chain or even require L2s to collateralize ETH to use Ethereum's blob transaction layer. There is talk of implementing ETH's next fork in a way that minimizes excess supply. If Ethereum makes these moves, it could regain lost economic value and stave off competition from its L2s or even Solana. Like with corporations and their stock price, an underperforming token can often trigger a pivot. Ethereum might be nearing that inflection point. L2 Margins for Optimism Are Up Nearly 4x to 99% Since Jan 2024 Source: Dune @sealaunch as of 9/30/2024; We define L2 margins as the profits of L2 transactions/revenues of transactions. Profits are the transaction fee revenues on L2s less the costs associated with posting data to Ethereum (call data + blob fees) and verification of proofs (Zk L2s). Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. NEAR (+30.9%) NEAR Protocol (NEAR-USD) is up (+30.9%) over the last 30 days, rebounding after underperforming in August. Year-to-date, NEAR has delivered mid-range returns compared to other top Layer-1 protocols, exhibiting deeper drawdowns during the summer doldrums but more volatile upside in September's market resurgence. A $100 investment in NEAR on January 1st would now be worth $143.83, compared to $251.17 for TON, $208.73 for SUI, $189.01 for BNB, and $113.04 for Ethereum. NEAR Fees Are Up 94%, DAAs Are Up 200% Since Jan 2024 Source: Artemis.xyz as of 9/30/2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. NEAR's outperformance appears to be driven by both technical improvements and strategic user growth initiatives. In late August, NEAR implemented Nightshade 2.0, a key milestone in its scalability roadmap. Nightshade's sharding architecture splits the blockchain into multiple ""shards"". Each shard processes transactions in parallel, boosting throughput and efficiency. Additionally, stateless validation was introduced, meaning that validators no longer need to store the whole blockchain's state locally. Instead, validators need only retrieve the necessary parts (the ""state witnesses""), which increases decentralization by lowering validator operating costs. Looking ahead, Nightshade 2.0 sets the stage for ""dynamic re-sharding,"" a key upgrade planned for early 2025 that will allow the network to automatically adjust its shard count based on demand. NEAR's September efforts also extended into chain abstraction, which is the process of eliminating the technical burdens of transacting across different blockchains. Top NEAR ecosystem applications like Sweatcoin (a fitness rewards app claiming 150 million total users) prefer chain abstraction to attract wider audiences, according to NEAR cofounder Illia Polosukhin. NEAR Protocol's most popular app, 'HOT' Wallet, reached all-time highs of 2M unique active wallets in September, suggesting increased network adoption. Underscoring the strategic importance of NEAR's technical features, HOT Wallet's ecosystem focuses on quality-of-life chain abstraction features such as gas-free swaps, cross-chain applications, and bridges. NEAR's AI-centric partnership strategy is also likely contributing to its strong September price performance. Hyperbolic, an AI & GPU cloud resources project which raised a $7M seed round in July, announced a partnership with NEAR this month. NEAR.AI will use Hyperbolic's global network to process AI inference workloads from ChatGPT-like apps. Like other DePIN (""Decentralized Physical Infrastructure"") projects, this strategy aims at crowdsourcing resources to compete for business currently dominated by large, centralized players (in this case, data centers). Similarly, Ringfence.ai partnered with NEAR to use the blockchain as part of its personal data storage & monetization architecture . Arguably, this corroborates NEAR's thesis on ""user-owned AI"". IMX (+24%) Gaming-Oriented Blockchain Market Cap Dominance Source: CoinMarketCap as of 9/30/2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. One of the oldest gaming-focused crypto projects, Immutable (IMX), is a standout on our watchlist this month. In September, IMX gained a (+36%) market share against a few other gaming blockchain tokens like APE, BEAM, FLOW, RON, WAXP, and XAI. Immutable ( IMX-USD ) was founded in 2018 after its creators' NFT trading card game, Gods Unchained, congested Ethereum, driving up transaction fees and delays. To address these issues, Immutable launched its own Ethereum L2 blockchains-Immutable X and Immutable zkEVM-and evolved into a full gaming platform. In its September update, Immutable highlighted that its zkEVM blockchain, launched in Q1, reached 3 million monthly active users, a milestone that took other Layer 2 solutions 1 to 4 years to achieve. This growth comes from just 5-10% of its games. With a range of 400+ titles, Immutable takes more ""shots on goal"" than competitors. Its user-friendly Passport wallet, designed to overcome gamers' resistance to crypto, exceeded 2.2 million signups in September, boosted by one-click social logins with double the completion rate of traditional wallets. Immutable's publicity has also been notable. At Gamescom, the world's largest gaming event in August, 7 of the top 10 games showcased were built on Immutable. In September, the company joined MARBLEX at Korea Blockchain Week to highlight their partnership, which brings Netmarble's high-performing titles (~$80M USD in 2024 revenue, 1M+ MAUs) into Immutable's ecosystem. The Asian market's higher crypto adoption and gaming asset spending per capita offer a promising pipeline. The success of Immutable's titles reflects this momentum. Guild of Guardians surpassed 1 million downloads, and RavenQuest saw ~62k unique players within 9 days of early access. Immortal Rising 2, launched on Immutable's zkEVM on September 12th, became the #1 free game on Vietnam's iOS AppStore. Gamers can earn Gem tokens by completing quests across Immutable games and boost earnings by holding IMX tokens, potentially creating a flywheel for token demand. Gaming-Oriented Blockchain Comp Table Sources: DeFiLlama, DappRadar, CryptoSlam as of 9/30/2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. IMX's year-to-date price has been middle-of-the-pack among its peers. FLOW (-35.2%) lags, with NBA Top Shot failing to replicate its 2021 volumes. Ronin (-0.5%) is more focused on its own IP, adding 13 titles to Axie Infinity ( AXS-USD ). Beam (+11.1%) recently migrated to its own Avalanche ( AVAX-USD ) subnet. WAX, though technically up (+1,097%) from its $0.02 January opening, is down (-60%) from its peak and struggles with a high fully diluted value and low circulating supply. ApeCoin (-50.6%) has been diluted since launch, with its dedicated ApeChain still pending. Comparing chains is challenging due to obfuscated metrics and bots, but some general observations can still be made. IMX has a high valuation relative to its monthly unique active wallets (UAWs) and NFT buyers, suggesting a more dedicated user base. BEAM and XAI show high valuations relative to their low TVL, indicating speculative interest typical of newer ecosystems. WAX consistently lags, likely due to limited traction and bot activity. FLOW's fewer monthly NFT buyers spend significantly more than Ronin's, indicating either fewer bots or a more motivated collector base. Despite its weak gaming focus, FLOW's valuation per UAW is a standout in this cohort. Gaming-Oriented Tokens (+20%) Year-to-Date Market Cap Growth: Gaming Tokens (Aggregate) vs. Bitcoin Source: The Tie as of 9/29/2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. Gaming-Oriented Token Comp Table (Plus Bitcoin) Source: The Tie as of 9/30/2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. Zooming out, we compared the aggregate valuations of 30 select gaming tokens-not just gaming blockchain tokens-against Bitcoin. Gaming tokens have shown much higher volatility than Bitcoin year-to-date. While they delivered double Bitcoin's returns in February, nearly all those gains were wiped out by July. As of September 29th, gaming tokens are up (+20%) YTD, supported by the broader bullish trend in September's crypto market. As we noted in our mid-September ChainCheck , we expect Bitcoin to perform strongly in Q4. Gaming tokens could again outperform Bitcoin during a price surge, but interpreting that outperformance requires nuance. The gaming token category is driven by nascent distribution channels, evolving audiences, and speculative technologies. Prices reflect more speculation than organic demand, which may take years to materialize. Additionally, gaming tokens often suffer from low liquidity and high FDV (fully diluted valuation), meaning much of the value exists only on paper, with little realized by secondary market participants. Thus, while gaming tokens may 'work' for VCs and token issuers, secondary market participants should exercise caution. Following the Pareto principle, we believe the long-term value in gaming will be concentrated among a few key players. In the longer run, we expect the broader gaming token category to underperform Bitcoin. September's Notable Laggard - POL (-4%) 1Y Returns of $100 Invested in Top Ethereum L2 Tokens Source: Artemis.xyz. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. Polygon ( MATIC-USD ) has been a notable laggard in September, trailing other Ethereum L2 tokens. Over the past 30 days, its token declined by (-3.96%), continuing a pattern of underperformance that's persisted since Q1. Daily active users (DAUs) have dropped by 2/3 since July, and fees have fallen by 50%. A $100 investment in Polygon on September 30th, 2023, would be worth $79.26 a year later, while similar investments in competitors like Immutable X ($305.56) and Mantle (MANTLE-USD) ($160.91) have fared much better. Polymarket, a prediction marketplace hosted on Polygon, is booming. Polymarket's election betting volumes surged from ~$6.6M in December to over $500M in September. However, political bets comprise as much as 90% of weekly wagers. And only USDC deposits and withdrawals create onchain transactions. Amid this disappointing price action, Polygon achieved a significant milestone in September with the MATIC token migrating to POL as part of the Polygon 2.0 roadmap. The POL token's design provides more interoperable utility to connect the various blockchains building on top of Polygon's ""Agglayer."" Initially, POL serves as the gas and staking token of the Polygon PoS blockchain, similar to MATIC. However, in subsequent phases of Polygon 2.0's rollout, community votes will integrate POL's new technical capabilities into additional Polygon-connected blockchains. While activity on the decentralized ""AggLayer"" protocol has disappointed somewhat, with daily active addresses and transactions close to 52-week lows, Polygon Labs invested $5M in custom-built zero-knowledge VPU (""verifiable processing units"") chips for ZK proof generation to kickstart more growth. Separately in the POL ecosystem, we are watching IoTeX, a decentralized physical infrastructure (DePIN) network that announced plans to integrate with Polygon's AggLayer as part of its IoTeX 2.0 upgrade. Multiple Polygon-based DePIN projects, including Geodnet and Dimo, already rely on IoTeX infrastructure, suggesting potential growth opportunities for DePIN use cases on the Polygon network. We also noticed that INX, a regulated hub for cryptocurrency and security token trading built on the Poylgon PoS Chain, added four new tokenized equities: Gamestop, Microsoft, Google, and Tesla. Although INX conducted the first-ever SEC approved token IPO, raising $125M, the INX token is down 95% from its all-time highs. Let's see if former Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein, who recently joined the board, can turn things around.

34342000,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=646268,1728133228,Dogecoin Whales Scoop Up 1 Billion DOGE: Time For Rally To Return?,"On-chain data shows the Dogecoin whales have gone on a significant buying spree in the past day, a sign that could be bullish for DOGE’s price. Dogecoin Whales Have Purchased Big Over The Last 24 Hours As pointed out by analyst Ali Martinez in a new post on X, the DOGE whales have been participating in net buying recently. The on-chain indicator of relevance here is the “Supply Distribution” from the analytics firm Santiment, which tells us about the total amount of coins that a given Dogecoin wallet group is holding right now. In the context of the current topic, the whale cohort is of interest. The range of this group is typically defined as 100 million to 1 billion coins, with only addresses carrying a balance between these cutoffs qualifying for it. At the current exchange rate of the memecoin, this range converts to $10.9 million at the lower and $109 million at the upper end. Clearly, this cohort corresponds to the large investors and thanks to this size of theirs, they can carry some degree of influence in the market. As such, the behavior of the whales can be worth keeping an eye on, as it may end up reflecting into the price of the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miner Selloff Is Calming Down: Green Sign For Rally To Continue? Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Dogecoin Supply Distribution for the whale entities over the last few weeks: As displayed in the above graph, the Dogecoin supply held by the 100 million to 1 billion coins group saw a sharp increase last month, implying that the whales made large net buying moves. What followed this accumulation was a rally toward the end of the month, which took DOGE beyond the $0.13 level for the first time since July. Since this peak, though, the asset’s price has taken a significant blow, as the cryptocurrency market as a whole has witnessed bearish winds. Interestingly, despite the price crash, the supply of the whales has only shown a further increase, implying that the whales are scooping coins up at these lows, believing them to be offering a profitable window into the memecoin. During the last 24 hours alone, these humongous investors have participated in net accumulation of over 1 billion DOGE, worth $109 million. Given that the last buying spree from the group led to a rally, it’s possible that this one might also result in a similar outcome. Related Reading: XRP Crashes 14% As Whales Send Deposits To Exchanges It only remains to be seen, though, whether this latest bet from the Dogecoin whales would pay off as well or not. DOGE Price Dogecoin has outperformed the other top coins during the last 24 hours with a rally of almost 5%, which has taken its price to $0.109. Thus, it’s possible the bullish effect of the whale buying may already be starting to take hold.

Its performance has worried many analysts and investors, considering ETH could be near another correction. Related Reading: Analysts Unfazed By Bitcoin (BTC) Drop, But Should We Fear October 5? Ethereum Whales Send Millions To Exchanges Ethereum has struggled to reclaim some key resistance levels since the October 1 correction. On Tuesday, the cryptocurrency saw its price nosedive from the $2,600 zone to the $2,300 mark, hovering between the lower and higher range of that support level for the past few days. Since then, news of multiple investors moving their tokens has hit the industry, alarming the community. On-chain analytics firm Lookonchain revealed that an Ethereum Initial Coin Offering (ICO) participant sold their tokens as the market bleed. Per the report, the whale deposited 12,010 ETH, worth $31.6 million, to Kraken a week ago after being inactive for two years. The same address sold another 19,000 ETH two days ago, around $47.54 million. Today, crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted that on October 3, roughly $259.2 million worth of ETH had been sent to crypto exchanges. According to the CryptoQuant data shared by Martinez, 108,000 ETH were sent to exchanges in the last 24 hours, significantly increasing from the day before. The news continued to fuel the bearish sentiment among many community members, who are disappointed about Ethereum’s performance and fear ETH’s price could soon face significant selling pressure. Will ETH Revisit Lower Levels Soon? Crypto investor Ted Pillows noted that ETH has been “one of the most underperforming cryptos in 2024.” Despite the approval of Ethereum spot ETFs (exchange-traded funds), the crypto has “underperformed almost every large cap.” He also pointed out that ETH surged alongside Bitcoin whenever the market was up but dropped significantly harder when the market struggled. “Whenever BTC has pumped 5%, ETH has pumped 3%, but whenever BTC has dumped 5%, ETH has dumped 12%-15%,” he remarked. However, Ted explained that every time Ethereum was considered “dead,” like in 2020-2021, it has eventually outperformed BTC. Based on this, the investor believes that ‘the king of Altcoins’ could face “one last flush” to $2,200 before the reversal. Similarly, trader Crypto General suggested that the cryptocurrency could retest the $4,000 by next month as he expects ETH to bounce from the current levels. However, he asserted that if the price breaks the trendline, “we can easily see the price touching the $2100 level.” Related Reading: Aptos (APT) Jumps 11% Following Acquisition Of Japanese Blockchain Developer HashPallette Other market watchers pointed out that Ethereum must reclaim the $2,400 resistance level to see a potential bounce toward $2,800. Previously, Daan Crypto Trades set the $2,850 resistance level as one of the key levels to watch. The analyst considers that reclaiming this level would signal a trend reversal for the cryptocurrency. This zone corresponds with the horizontal level that started the February-March run to ETH’s yearly high of $4,090. As of this writing, ETH has seen a positive price jump, currently trading at $2,431. This performance represents a 4.3% surge in the daily timeframe.

Hoskinson, who is also known for his role in co-founding Ethereum (ETH), has consistently praised Cardano’s progress over the past month following the recent upgrade, asserting its superiority over the largest cryptocurrencies on the market such as Bitcoin (BTC) in terms of decentralization. Hoskinson Declares Cardano Remains Top Dog In a recent post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), Hoskinson reaffirmed Cardano’s status, claiming it is “still number 1.” This statement follows his remarks at the Token2049 Conference in Singapore, where he discussed the new governance model of the Cardano network. Hoskinson emphasized that this model “redistributes power” from a select few to the broader community, addressing a key concern he sees with Ethereum’s “centralized structure.” Related Reading: Analyst Says PEPE Bearish Continuation Is Possible For A 50% Price Crash Hoskinson pointed out that Ethereum’s reliance on its founder, Vitalik Buterin, creates “a bottleneck for innovation,” whereas Cardano’s Chang hard fork has established a framework that ensures ongoing development regardless of individual involvement. Hoskinson further highlighted how delegated representatives (DReps) can now engage with one another, vote, and utilize a blockchain-based governance system to regularly ratify the network’s roadmap. He stated emphatically, “Charles, alive or dead, doesn’t matter. There’s still going to be innovation on a daily basis.” In addition, the Cardano blockchain has shown significant growth in key metrics, boasting over 74,000 Plutus scripts and the creation of 1.3 million delegated wallets over the last seven years. Additionally, approximately 1,373 projects have been launched on the platform, as highlighted in a commemorative video by Input Output Global (IOG), the development company behind the blockchain. Final Transition To Decentralized Governance? In his latest social media update, Hoskinson also remarked on Cardano’s advancements in decentralized governance, suggesting that the network is on the cusp of achieving remarkable milestones with upcoming features. Looking ahead, Cardano aims to replace its initial genesis keys, which have been instrumental in managing the network since its inception. This transition will be supported by increased participation from stake pool operators (SPOs) and DReps, as well as the establishment of a Constitutional Committee (CC). Related Reading: XRP Macro Charts Signal Explosive Bullish Move Despite SEC Appeal: Analyst The next steps toward achieving a fully decentralized governance model involve ensuring that stake pool nodes meet operational thresholds and that decentralized applications (DApps) are nearing completion. The final transition to the Voltaire era, signifying a fully self-sustaining blockchain, will occur with the final use of the Genesis keys, triggering another hard fork. However, further announcements and dates for these developments have yet to be released by IOG or the blockchain’s founder. At the time of writing, Cardano’s native token ADA trades at $0.352, recording a 2% price surge in the last 24 hours.

34335549,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=646305,1728118817,Ethereum Inflation Surge Casts Doubt On “Ultrasound Money” Claim: Report,"According to the latest Binance Research report, the Ethereum (ETH) issuance rate continued to rise in September 2024, raising concerns about the digital asset’s “ultrasound money” claim. Ethereum Issuance Rate Continues To Surge In its October 2024 Monthly Market Insights report, Binance Research highlighted that the ETH issuance rate continued its ascent in September, moving away from its previously deflationary status. Related Reading: Is Ethereum Primed For Surge? Analyst Reveals Key Levels to Watch For A $8,100 Rally The second largest digital asset by reported market cap had a 30-day annualized inflation rate of approximately 0.74%, a level not observed in the last two years. The sharp uptick in ETH supply inflation has questioned its “ultrasound money” positioning. Interestingly, the term “ultrasound money” draws inspiration from Bitcoin’s (BTC) “sound money” narrative. While BTC’s supply is capped at 21 million, ETH’s supply can become deflationary, theoretically increasing scarcity and protecting it from inflation-driven erosion of purchasing power. Ethereum’s high issuance rate could be attributed to several factors, including low mainnet on-chain activity, leading to a low transaction fee and, consequently, lower ETH burn rates. In 2021, Ethereum core developers implemented EIP-1559, which introduced a fee-burning mechanism that aimed to reduce ETH’s circulating supply, thereby creating deflationary pressure on the token. However, with declining mainnet activity, the amount of ETH being burned is lagging behind the ETH issuance rate, leading to a net inflationary trend. Notably, September 2024 experienced one of the lowest ETH burn rates since the highly anticipated Merge event, when Ethereum transitioned from a proof-of-work (PoW) to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Ethereum Layer-2 Solutions To Blame For Low ETH Burn Rate? The report points to March 2024 as the starting point of Ethereum’s inflationary trend, following the implementation of EIP-4844 or the Dencun upgrade, which reduced transaction costs on layer-2 scaling platforms such as Optimism (OP), Arbitrum (ARB), Base, and Polygon (MATIC). The report adds: As L2s cannibalized network activity throughout the year – further impacted by broader market conditions – transaction fees and, consequently, burned fees on Ethereum declined, with September recording one of the lowest levels since the Merge. This has prevented ETH from decreasing in supply to remain deflationary, leading to the net positive daily supply changes we now see. Recent trends corroborate the assertion above, as network activity on layer-2 solutions grows across different metrics. For instance, a report in July 2024 noted that daily active addresses and transaction volume on Polygon had soared significantly. Related Reading: Ethereum Solo Staking Made Easier? Vitalik Buterin Supports Lower Entry Requirements Similarly, decentralized finance (DeFi) activity on Arbitrum increased earlier this year when decentralized exchange (DEX) Uniswap surpassed $150 billion in total swap volume on the network. Another report found that over 48% of digital assets bridged from the Ethereum network end up on Arbitrum, indicating users’ high trust in the layer-2 network’s robust security and reliability. ETH trades at $2,385 at press time, up 1.7% in the past 24 hours.

This surge was primarily driven by a broader market rally and bolstered by excitement surrounding crypto asset manager Bitwise’s filing for an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) earlier this week. However, the enthusiasm was short-lived. XRP has since lost nearly 12% of its value on the weekly time frame, following the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) decision to appeal a partial victory for Ripple, the blockchain payments company associated with XRP. XRP Price Strength During Legal Battles The SEC’s appeal has sent ripples through the cryptocurrency community, raising concerns about the future of XRP and its regulatory status. Market expert Bobby A addressed these concerns in a recent social media post, arguing that the macro charts do not indicate the onset of a prolonged bear market for the XRP price due to the appeal. Instead, Bobby A suggests that such events often lead to missed opportunities for “uninformed or impatient investors” who may react impulsively to market news, and claims that despite these short-term challenges, the token can continue its upward trajectory in the coming months. Related Reading: Analyst Says Bitcoin Crash Might Not Be Over, Why $60,365 Is Important The expert points out that the XRP price has shown resilience in the face of regulatory challenges. For example, during the SEC lawsuit that began in 2020, XRP was able to rise from $0.11 to $1.95 despite significant legal headwinds. Bobby A emphasizes that the XRP price has been consolidating sideways for nearly seven years, indicating a strong macro base that could pave the way for future price appreciation. No Indications Of A Bear Market From a technical analysis perspective, Bobby A highlights that the monthly time frame for the XRP price reveals critical patterns. Following Bitcoin’s Halving cycles, XRP has historically experienced rapid price surges during cyclical rotations of momentum oscillators. This pattern was evident in previous years, particularly in 2017 and 2020. Moreover, the Bollinger Bands—a technical indicator that measures market volatility—are currently at their tightest levels in XRP’s history. The expert suggests that tight Bollinger Bands often precede significant price movements, which can be “deceptive at first,” as they may initially mislead market participants. Bobby A argues that current market conditions should not be misinterpreted as the start of a bear market. Instead, he suggests that XRP is positioned for potential capitulation in “deep value areas.” With legal clarity, a real use case and what he sees as the imminent ETF, he believes XRP is poised for mass adoption.

Finally, the market expert pointed to the upcoming US general election, which could play a crucial role in XRP’s future. Bobby speculated that if former President Donald Trump is re-elected, it could lead to significant changes within the SEC, potentially alleviating some of the regulatory concerns that have plagued the asset. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $0.522, up 0.6% over the past 24 hours.

Political turmoil has hurt Bitcoin before. When tensions grow, cryptocurrency prices fall, unlike gold, market analysts say. Related Reading: Is Crypto Losing Steam? Bitcoin And Ethereum Addresses Shrink In 2024 Bitcoin shot down to about $59,000 as the Middle East’s crisis worsened, and then recovered somewhat, but continuing volatility is probably in the cards.

Market expert Ali Martinez notes that Bitcoin is moving in a descending parallel channel, a pattern generally associated with price drops. Bitcoin’s technical setup says it might drop to $52,000, increasing uncertainty.

According to CryptoQuant, Long/Short Volume to Open Interest Ratio is a notable indicator that reflects trader positioning: when this ratio grows, it indicates that long positions are dominant and it is commonly seen as an indication of positive market movement. A little too much optimism in the markets, however, produces prices to be corrected downwards. On the other hand, too much short position also hints at bearish sentiments, but at the extreme, it can be a precursor to the rebound of prices. BTCUSD trading at $61,696 on the daily chart: TradingView.com Currently, Bitcoin’s sentiment remains neutral, with the Fear & Greed Index at 41, reflecting the caution in the market. This suggests that, despite its stable performance with 60% green trading days over the last month, investors are still wary. Geopolitical Factors While geopolitical events influenced the price movement of Bitcoin aside from technical analysis, its movements are varied. According to cryptocurrency analyst Jesse Colombo, the coin usually traded downhill during periods of increased global tensions. So far, there is a rebound due to the Middle East crisis, and its traders are expecting more of the same. This has the consequence of making the alpha crypto experience drastic value changes mainly when the tensions in different parts of the world keep rising.

34329027,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=646332,1728104437,Is The Worst Over For Bitcoin? Analyst Suggests Local Bottom May Be Here,"A CryptoQuant analyst known as “caueconomy” recently published a post indicating that Bitcoin (BTC) may have reached a local bottom. The analyst points to a significant liquidation event as a key sign that a short-term recovery could be on the horizon. Although caueconomy acknowledged that Bitcoin has been going through a period marked by bearish price sentiment and technical indicators suggesting potential further decline, the analyst also highlighted that emerging signs may indicate a stabilization in the asset’s price. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miner Selloff Is Calming Down: Green Sign For Rally To Continue? How Is BTC Long Liquidations Suggesting Local Bottom? The post by caueconomy on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform titled “Liquidation of long positions may have established a local bottom” sheds light on how long-position liquidations in the futures market could influence Bitcoin’s price. Caueconomy elaborates that in the face of notable price declines, long contracts bought on future exchanges tend to experience sharp reductions due to mass liquidations. This process, in turn, diminishes the selling pressure that often exacerbates price drops, potentially setting the stage for a recovery in the asset’s price in the short term. On October 1st, over 4,000 BTC long positions were liquidated, marking the second-largest liquidation event of 2024 based on data compiled by CryptoQuant. The analyst mentioned that such significant liquidation events often indicate potential market reversals or local bottoms, as the selling pressure from these positions is removed from the market. However, caueconomy points out that it is crucial to keep a close eye on the buying strength to gauge whether it can offset the decline and facilitate recovery. The analyst advises that although the current range may be sustained in the short term, the potential for upward movement is contingent on renewed buying interest and market activity. The analyst concluded in the post: At this point, the price is likely to sustain the current range in the short term, but it will be necessary to watch the buying strength to be able to recover the decline. Is there Any Sign Of Buying Interest In Bitcoin Currently? So far, Bitcoin appears to be seeing a gradual rebound in price registering a 3.5% increase in the past day to reclaim the $62,000 mark. At the time of writing, the asset currently trades for $62,238. This increase in BTC has been reflected in the overall crypto market, with the global crypto market cap now up by 2% in the past day to a current valuation of 2.26 trillion. Meanwhile, a renowned crypto analyst known as Ali on X recently reported a form of Bitcoin buying interest ongoing on an exchange. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin On The Brink Of A Reversal? Here’s What This Key Indicator Suggests In a post uploaded earlier today on X, Ali pointed out that there has been a surge in the Taker Buy/Sell Ratio on OKX, the fourth-largest cryptocurrency exchange by 24-hour trading volume.

Among those closely monitoring the price action in anticipation of an uptrend is a well-known analyst on the social media platform X. This analyst, who goes by the name Ash Crypto, recently highlighted a striking similarity between Bitcoin’s current price behavior and a notable pattern observed earlier in 2023. Ash Crypto pointed to Bitcoin’s decline in early October 2023, which ultimately reversed into a multi-month rally to its current all-time high. Explaining The Similar Price Action October 2023 was the turning point for the price of Bitcoin and many cryptocurrencies. It was during this month that the crypto industry finally broke out of a lengthy bear cycle, with Bitcoin heralding the charge toward renewed optimism and significant price gains. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Solana-Based BONK Is In Prime Position For Legendary Rally For the first time since January, Bitcoin’s market capitalization surged by an impressive 28.52%, sparking a shift in market dynamics that rippled throughout the industry. Although altcoins followed a similar upward trajectory, their gains were modest compared to Bitcoin. However, their collective impact was able to push the entire cryptocurrency market capitalization past the $1.25 trillion mark for the first time since May 2022. However, while October 2023 was the start of the new bull cycle, what most investors don’t know or have forgotten is that the month started on a negative note. As Ash Crypto pointed out, the price of Bitcoin dropped by 7.5% in the first week of October 2023. According to the BTC/USD price chart, this decline saw the price of Bitcoin fall below $26,500. However, it soon rebounded from this point. By the end of October 2023, Bitcoin had rallied to close the month at over $35,000, representing a remarkable 33% increase from the month’s low. Fast forward to October 2024, and it appears that Bitcoin is once again repeating its pattern from the previous year. At the start of the month, Bitcoin was trading just below $64,000, a strong position given its recent bullish trends. However, in a movement similar to October 2023, the cryptocurrency experienced another sharp decline, this time dropping by 6.5% within the first three days. Notably, the price briefly touched $60,750 during this period. Related Reading: Crypto Capo Returns After 2 Months To Predict Ethereum Decline To $1,800, Is It Time To Go Long? What Does This Mean For Bitcoin? If history were to repeat itself in full, Bitcoin could maybe or maybe not drop a little bit more before rebounding to the upside. According to Ash Crypto’s projection, a similar 33% surge would see Bitcoin shooting above its current all-time high, with a monthly close right in the middle of $75,000 and $76,000. At the time of writing, Bitcoin has recovered a bit and is now trading at $61,580. Despite this early setback, many bullish investors are keeping a close eye on Bitcoin in anticipation of Uptober coming to fruition.

34322549,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=646329,1728090024,Here’s What Will Happen If Bitcoin Respects This MVRV Ratio Support Level,"A CryptoQuant analyst using the pseudonym “tugbachain” has recently shed light on a key trend within the Bitcoin market. Posting on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform, the analyst focused on the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio, an important metric in the Bitcoin market. According to tugbachain, the MVRV ratio shows a historical downward trend. Should this trend continue or get breached, it may lead to a major impact on Bitcoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s NVT Cross Signals a Local Top – Is a Major Correction Looming? MVRV Ratio And Its Impending Impact On Bitcoin The MVRV ratio, as explained by tugbachain, is a tool used to gauge whether a cryptocurrency is overvalued or undervalued. This ratio is calculated by comparing the market value to the realized value of Bitcoin, providing insights into investor behavior and market trends. The analyst highlighted that the MVRV has proven useful in identifying market tops, bottoms, and notable peaks and troughs over the years. The MVRV ratio has historically demonstrated three major Bitcoin halving cycles, each marked by unique price behavior and investor sentiment. The current ratio sits around 1.9, with significant support noted at 1.75. The question raised by tugbachain is whether breaking the downtrend could lead to a rise in the MVRV ratio to the 4-6 range, which has historically signaled a Bitcoin peak. The analyst wrote in the post: Currently, the MVRV ratio shows a historical downtrend with significant support at 1.75. With the ratio now sitting at 1.9, the question arises: if it breaks the downtrend and reverses the downtrend, could it once again climb to the 4-6 range, marking a Bitcoin peak as seen in previous cycles? BTC Market Performance And Technical Outlook Bitcoin has seen heightened price activity in recent weeks in the broader market context. The asset rallied above $66,000 last week, sparking enthusiasm in the crypto community with hopes for a bullish October, playfully termed “Uptober.” However, this upward momentum was short-lived, as BTC experienced a notable price correction soon after. Within the past week alone, Bitcoin has seen a decline of around 7.2%, falling to a trading price of $61,496 at the time of writing. Despite this correction, BTC has rebounded slightly, posting a modest 1.9% gain over the past 24 hours. Aside from tugbachain’s analysis, other crypto market analysts have provided additional perspectives on the MVRV ratio’s implications for BTC. Ali, a prominent analyst on the social media platform X, has pointed out that the MVRV ratio’s behavior since May has notably impacted Bitcoin’s price movements. Related Reading: Here Is Why The Bitcoin Bull Run Hasn’t Started, According To Analyst Ali observed that each rejection of the MVRV ratio from its 90-day average has historically led to a significant correction in Bitcoin’s price.

34321724,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=646286,1728088240,Meme Coin Trader Misses A $25 Million Payout After Selling HIPPO On Sui Network Early,"Crypto activity is dynamic, and with over two million tokens (and growing), it is hard to know precisely which of these coins will pump and on which network. Admittedly, meme coins have been dominating headlines, especially on Solana. From MooDeng to Bonk and Pepe, traders are on the lookout. Meme Coin Trader Misses A $25 Million Payout In the past week, eyes have been on Sui Network, a modern blockchain that claims to process over 50,000 transactions every second (TPS) and is faster than Solana. The spike in activity results from the success of what’s arguably one of the largest meme coins in its ecosystem. Related Reading: Aptos (APT) Jumps 11% Following Acquisition Of Japanese Blockchain Developer HashPallette After launching nearly six days ago, Sudeng (HIPPO) is on fire, posting impressive higher highs. The surge over this time has pushed HIPPO’s market cap and, thus liquidity, higher, looking at swaps at Sui Network‘s decentralized exchange, Cetus 4. Changing hands at over $0.010 means traders who got in early, choosing to HODL on and not getting concerned with the sell-off across major markets like Bitcoin could be neck-dip in profits. According to trackers, one meme coin trader is regretting after exiting early, dumping HIPPO for a small profit. On launch, the trader sold 258 SUI, worth around $433, for 1.8 billion HIPPO. This is nearly 20% of the total supply standing at 10 billion. However, the trader chose to sell all this stash for 6,299 SUI days later, racking in nearly $11,000. The problem is, if the trader had chosen to wait, even for another 36 hours, it would have turned out to be major gains. As of October 4, the 1.8 billion HIPPO, is now worth over $25 million. The premature decision to sell is proving costly and is a missed opportunity. All the same, the trader shouldn’t be blamed. The $11,000 earned represents a more than 200X gain. Moreover, even if the trader would have held on, becoming a diamond hand and waiting for prices to rally, it would have been tough for the trader to exit all at once. HIPPO Concentration A Concern: Will The Sudeng Pump? HIPPO is not very liquid, and looking at ownership from SuiScan, one address controls over 7.6 billion tokens, which is more than 76% of the total supply. If the trader held on, the address would be the second largest. Any attempt to sell would force prices lower, triggering panic as other holders scramble to the exits. Related Reading: XRP Crashes 14% As Whales Send Deposits To Exchanges Currently, traders will be closely monitoring how HIPPO performs. As a meme coin, much depends on hype and whether there is a fear of missing out (FOMO). If that’s the case, the meme coin will float higher, outperforming SUI, which is also relatively firm.
