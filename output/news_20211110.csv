The NFT space generated a trading volume of over $10.67 billion in 3Q 2021 alone, and with such a remarkable growth ArtTactic&apos;s report set off many alarms. Anders Petterson, the founder of ArtTactic, started the report by saying: &apos;Before we throw ourselves into the metaverse, it might be a good idea to stop and ask ourselves what we want this digital universe to look like, before we repeat our mistakes from the past.&apos; Grimes is the only female artist to make it to the top-10 NFT sales list with $8.9 million in sales. The next one ranked below the top-10 is Jo-Ani Charland in 50th place with a total of $1.6 million in sales.

42424321,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2n6Lh,1636587008,First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Declines After Reaching a Record High; Ether Also Drops,"Good morning, Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market moves: Bitcoin soared past $69K before dropping below $65K.  Technician’s take: Intraday charts are showing initial signs of upside exhaustion.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $64,626  Ether (ETH): $4,613  Market moves  Bitcoin faced a pullback below $65,000 in the past 24 hours, a more than 4% decline, after it surpassed $69,000 for the first time in its history during U.S. trading hours on Wednesday. Ether fell to about $4,600, a roughly 3% drop.  The sharp dip came after news that China Evergrande Group failed to pay at least some of its international investors interest payments on bonds the real estate giant issued, raising more concerns about a potential default of the company.  The market perceived the new record price above $69,000 as a reaction to the newly published U.S. Consumer Price Index, which jumped to its highest level in three decades.  Data collected by CoinDesk also shows Wednesday’s rally was not supported by strong trading volume. It was lower on Wednesday than it was on Monday and Tuesday across major centralized exchanges.  As CoinDesk’s David Morris wrote, the deeply indebted Chinese real estate developer has been an important factor to the much broader financial market, crypto included. With its roots in China and worries about Tether’s holdings of Chinese debt, investors may want to watch how Asia’s crypto markets react on Thursday.  Technician’s take  Bitcoin Pulls Back From All-Time High, Support Between $63K-$65K  Bitcoin was slightly lower, trading around $65,000 at the time of publication, although buyers could hold support above $63,000-$65,000 into Asian trading hours.  Intraday charts are showing initial signs of upside exhaustion, which typically lead to a brief pullback in BTC’s price. For example, the relative strength index (RSI) on the four-hour chart continues to hover near short-term overbought levels.  Still, upside momentum signals are improving on the daily price chart for the first time since Oct. 1, which preceded a price rally from $44,000. This suggests that buyers could remain active on pullbacks.  Two consecutive daily closes above an all-time price high would yield further upside targets, initially toward $86,000.

42421690,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXp9Qr,1636586001,"Why Crypto Should Modify the Section 6050i Tax Change, Not Fight It","Last week, a four-decades old law about cash was modified to incorporate cryptocurrency. Buried deep inside President Biden’s thousand-page Infrastructure bill was an amendment to an arcane section of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, which sets reporting requirements for payments made with cash. The definition of “cash” was amended to include crypto. Rather than celebrate the law’s ratification of crypto, many in the cryptocurrency community are furious.  Over the centuries a large body of law has evolved pertaining uniquely to cash.  J.P. Koning, a CoinDesk columnist, worked as an equity researcher at a Canadian brokerage firm and a financial writer at a large Canadian bank. He runs the popular Moneyness blog.  One of society’s oldest cash-specific laws is legal tender. Other ancient laws cover counterfeiting. A newer law, one from the 18th century says that “currency cannot be followed.” If a stolen banknote is innocently accepted by a merchant, the merchant gets to keep it. Stolen goods, however, must be returned to their original owner.  More recent laws governing cash tend to specify due diligence and reporting requirements. Since 1970, U.S. banks have been required to submit currency transaction reports for cash deposits or withdrawals in excess of $10,000.  Into this thicket of laws governing cash, Satoshi Nakamoto kickstarted a novel “electronic cash system.” Since then a whole slew of other bitcoin-inspired cash systems have emerged including Ethereum, Dogecoin and Tether.  Fans of these systems have spent the last decade clamoring for mainstream legitimacy. “Bitcoin fixes this!” they say. And this legitimization seems to be happening. Usage is growing. In some cases, crypto has gone mainstream.  But the second-half of gaining legitimacy is integration with the body of existing laws. Electronic cash somehow has to be spliced into our centuries’ old rules about cash, coins and other bearer instruments.  It’s at this point of the legitimization process that many cryptocurrency advocates who coveted mainstream cash status for their tokens suddenly balk. Legitimization also involves, yikes... extra responsibilities?  This “balking” is precisely what is happening with the recent amendment of Section 6050i of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code to include crypto, passed last week as part of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.  A brief explanation of Section 6050i  On its face, the amendment provides cryptocurrency advocates with the legitimacy they’ve always craved. Cryptocurrency is being included in the definition of cash alongside banknotes and coins.  Being classified as cash, however, brings an associated set of burdens. Section 6050i imposes reporting requirements on cash users that non-cash users don’t face. If you own a jewelry store, for instance, and someone buys $10,000 worth of jewelry from you using banknotes, you need to report their purchase. Not so if they pay with a debit card. It is these new requirements that are causing cryptocurrency fans to balk.  Let’s look a bit closer at the law.  Section 6050i requires people engaged in “trade or business” to collect information about those who make purchases in excess of $10,000 using banknotes and coins. They must report this information by filling out what is known as a Form 8300 and filing it with the IRS or the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). A Form 8300 must also be filled out when purchases are consummated with cashiers’ checks, money orders or traveler’s checks.  And now with the amendment, a purchase in excess of $10,000 made with bitcoin or any other types of crypto will require a Form 8300, too. The changes don’t take effect immediately, though. Reporting won’t become necessary until l 2024.  Lawmakers introduced the Form 8300 requirement in 1984, almost 40 years ago.  The motivating idea was to address tax evasion and laundering of the proceeds of crime. Moving criminally-derived cash into the banking system had already been targeted in 1970 by requiring banks to report cash withdrawals or deposits of $10,000. But criminals can also clean dirty cash by buying goods and services, say cars or real estate. And so the Form 8300 requirement, which extends reporting duties to cash accepting businesses, came to life.  There’s no crypto exemption  Cryptocurrency users may not like the amendment, but requiring Form 8300 reporting for cryptocurrencies is a perfectly reasonable extension of the law. The application of law to cash should be technologically-neutral. That is, irrespective of the form or medium on which it is instantiated, cash is cash – it should be treated equally. If Tesla dealers are obligated to report purchases of Teslas consummated with banknotes, they should have to do the same with bitcoin.  However, I agree with several of the criticisms that members of the cryptocurrency community have aired concerning the amendment to 6050i, particularly those made by Abraham Sutherland, an adjunct professor at the University of Virginia School of Law and advisor to the Proof of Stake Alliance. Although the amendment has already passed, it probably deserves to be revisited.  Here are some suggestions.  The main weakness is the way that crypto has been absorbed into Section 6050i’s definition of cash.  In determining what is to be defined as cash, the law uses a catch-all term “digital assets.” It defines a digital asset as “any digital representation of value which is recorded on a cryptographically secured distributed ledger.”  But as Sutherland points out – and I agree – “digital assets” is an overly-broad category. A non-fungible token (NFT) is very different from a centralized stablecoin like USD Coin. Bitcoin isn’t the same as what regulators refer to as LTDA, or legal tender digital assets (i.e. a blockchain-based central bank digital currency). Nor are dogecoin and dai equal. Yet by bracketing them all under the same category, they have all become “cash” in the eyes of 6050i.  Digital assets shouldn’t be bucketed together because they don’t function the same way. Some digital assets are more like cash than others. Some are more like property, or collectibles.  The best way to resolve this problem would be to break the category “digital assets” up into three types: stable digital assets (stablecoins and LTDA), non-stable fungible coins (bitcoin, ether, dogecoin, etc) and non-stable non-fungible coins (NFTs). The monetary threshold for triggering a Form 8300 reporting requirement, currently set at a flat $10,000, should be indexed to the type of digital asset.  The more “moneylike” a digital asset is – i.e. the more that it gets used as a medium of exchange – the more likely that it is useful for moving the proceeds of crime. Purchases made with these assets should face the lowest, and most stringent, thresholds. The less money-like the digital asset, the higher the threshold.  Stable digital assets such as stablecoins are the most likely to be used for payments, and should therefore face a similar $10,000 reporting threshold as cash. The argument can be made that stablecoins merit an even higher, and looser, threshold than cash, say $30,000, since blockchains provide a degree of traceability – cash and cashier’s checks don’t.  The threshold for payments made with non-stable fungibles like bitcoin should be even higher, say $50,000. This is because their volatility makes them less conducive for payments, and so the money laundering risk they present is lower than cash or stable digital assets.  Lastly, payments with non-stable non-fungibles such as NFTs should not be included at all in the category “digital assets.” If they are included, they should be subject to an even higher ceiling, say $100,000.  I’m using these thresholds for illustrative purposes only. The point I’m trying to make is that some combination of exemptions and staggered reporting thresholds would constitute a fairer way of bringing digital assets into the ambit of 6050i.  Majore compliance challenges will also crop up in decentralized finance, or DeFi. Section 6050i applies to “persons” engaged in trade. But is a truly decentralized protocol a person? Can a smart contract that accepts a $100,000 deposit of USDC be obliged to file a Form 8300 with FinCEN?  I’d suggest that a genuinely decentralized protocol should be exempt from the law’s definition of person. But fakely decentralized protocols – those protocols which are controlled by a person or corporation – should be obliged to report.  Regulated DeFi protocols (such as Swarm Markets) would also be exempt from Form 8300 requirements. So would their users. These gated protocols make an effort to know who is using their protocol, so a Form 8300 requirement would be redundant.  DeFi users who regularly receive digital assets from senders through the intermediation of genuinely decentralized protocols, say decentralized exchanges, may also incur reporting requirements. Compliance will be difficult since the receiving person cannot be linked to the sender. Higher thresholds for non-stable digital assets such as Ether would help reduce the reporting burden. Builders of decentralized protocols may want to consider developing 6050i compliance tools that connect receivers back to the original source of funds.  Lastly, stablecoins can help with compliance. Until now, centralized stablecoin issuers like Tether and USD Coin have taken a hands-off approach to identifying owners of stablecoins. If they were to adopt universal customer due diligence, only known parties would be able to own stablecoins. This would absolve DeFi users of the constant hassle of submitting Form 8300s.  Enjoying the fruits of legitimization means bearing the legal responsibilities that come with that legitimization. But at the same time, one also hopes that lawmakers do a better job of fusing crypto into Section 9050i than their current iteration. Reporting purchases made with crypto won’t take effect until 2024. We have a few years to resolve this.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | DOGE | REGULATION,JP Koning,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/11/10/why-crypto-should-modify-the-section-6050i-tax-change-not-fight-it,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dd955c5d218d7cf8ac95138e9f3017181ef6e293-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42424306,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2n5rh,1636584215,At Least 77% of NFT Art Sales Going to Male Creators: Study,"A recent study on the state of the non-fungible token (NFT) art market points to some of the lasting gender disparities in the world of cryptocurrency, and suggests the industry still has a long way to go.  The study, conducted by a research agency called Art Tactic and reported by Bloomberg, claims at least 77% of the money generated by NFT art sales over the past 21 months went to male artists, with just 5% going to female artists.  A caveat is that 16% of sales were chalked up to creators of “unknown” gender – hence the “at least.” Another caveat is that Bloomberg’s report on the study neglects to say how many NFT artists are women. Art Tactic arrived at these percentages by looking at total sales, but a look at the ratio of the amount of women to men in this space might provide a fuller picture of the inequities on display.  Regardless of whether the disparity is on the buyer side or the artist side, it’s a glaring one. The musician Grimes was the only woman on Art Tactic’s list of the top 10 best-selling NFT artists, thanks to a blockbuster sale on the Winklevoss-owned marketplace Nifty Gateway earlier this year.  None of this should come as much of a surprise – crypto has always been synonymous with a kind of toxically libertarian bro culture (though there are signs that’s beginning to change: in the more progressive corners of crypto, collectives such as Web 3 Baddies and aGENDAdao are starting to chip away at the archetype of the white male bitcoin bro.)  Beeple, today’s most expensive crypto artist, sold an NFT called “Everydays” for $69 million earlier this year. The work is a collage of 5,000 individual images, drawn over the course of the past 13 years, some of which feature racist and misogynistic themes.  The Art Tactic study also points to some of the broader wealth inequality issues in crypto.  Proponents of a crypto-backed creator economy have claimed that NFTs are a “grassroots” movement, with an eye toward bringing marginalized groups back into the fold. But according to Art Tactic, 55% of all the money generated by NFT art sales over the past 21 months went to just 16 artists.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | MARKET | RESEARCH,Will Gottsegen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/11/10/at-least-77-of-nft-art-sales-going-to-male-creators-study,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e2fcdb853ac7f0ca537696b51c3091e949d9fe22-1500x816.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42424320,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2n6Jh,1636583121,Bitcoin Jumps to New All-Time High as Inflation Spikes to 6.2% in October,"Perceived store-of-value assets like bitcoin and gold are rising as investors reassess the stickiness of inflation in the wake of a hotter-than-expected October reading in the U.S. consumer price index (CPI).  The price of bitcoin (BTC) has increased by nearly $3,000, hitting a new record high of $68,950, since the Labor Department’s CPI report was released at 13:30 UTC (8:30 a.m. ET).  “It is eye-opening to see the price react so spectacularly in this way,” Simon Peters, crypto asset analyst at the trading platform eToro, said in an email.  The report showed that the cost of living in the U.S. rose 6.2% in October from a year earlier, the fastest since 1990. Core inflation, which strips out the volatile food and energy component, rose 4.6%, the highest pace since August 1991.  The new data could provide a fresh test for Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s characterization of the inflation threat as “transitory” – the idea that upward price pressure will subside once the global economy has fully reopened from coronavirus-related restrictions and supply-chain bottlenecks and other issues are temporary.  The inflation increase was “broad-based, with increases in the indexes for energy, shelter, food, used cars and trucks and new vehicles among the larger contributors,” the Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics said in its statement.  Bitcoin is now trading 2.7% higher on the day. Based on a price-chart analysis, a descending trendline breakout seen on the hourly chart has exposed the psychological resistance at $70,000.  Bitcoin rallied 40% in October. The popular narrative was that the launch of a bitcoin futures-based exchange-traded fund (ETF) would bring in mainstream money, pushing up demand for the cryptocurrency and thus the price.  But analysts at JPMorgan attributed the rally to rising inflation expectations and bitcoin’s appeal as a hedge against rising prices.  Many cryptocurrency investors see the digital asset as a bulwark against central bank money printing, due to limits on bitcoin’s supply that are hard-coded into the underlying blockchain network’s programming.  Bitcoin’s price reaction to the CPI report is not only a “signal that the market is extremely averse to inflationary pressure, it is a sign investors are now firmly using bitcoin as a hedge against rising prices,” eToro’s Peters said. “It is also a sign that institutional investors may be participating in ‘buying the news,’ as this is the sort of movement we’d typically associate with other markets that react heavily to economic news.”  The trend looks set to continue, with equity markets showing few signs of stress. Futures contracts tied to the S&P 500 index of large U.S. stocks were down a meager 0.2% at press time.  Gold, a traditional inflation hedge, has broken above a long-held resistance at $1,830 to trade at a five-month high of $1,853.  The U.S. five-year “breakeven rate” – a gauge of inflation expectations over the next five years derived from bond-market indicators – has jumped above 3%, the highest since at least 2001, according to Bloomberg.  What will the Fed do?  Traders in the market for futures contracts on the Federal Reserve’s key interest rate now see a 38% chance of a rate hike in June 2022, up from 28% prior to the CPI report.  Meanwhile, the two-year U.S. Treasury yield, which is more sensitive to rate hike expectations than the 10-year yield, has jumped eight basis points to 0.5%.  Should markets price in faster and earlier rate hikes, bitcoin’s momentum may slow.  St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard told CNBC on Tuesday that the U.S. central bank may hike its benchmark rate twice in 2022, after winding down its $120 billion-a-month bond-buying program.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/11/10/bitcoin-jumps-to-new-all-time-high-gold-rallies-as-inflation-expectations-surge,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b2611305bc7ba01e312ca4d048c5fd62bb4c5332-1440x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42375883,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwCKwF,1636580861,Market Wrap: Higher Inflation Expected to Send Bitcoin and Gold Higher Into End of Year,"Bitcoin reached an all-time price high of about $68,950 on Wednesday after a report showed higher-than-expected inflation in October. The cryptocurrency eventually returned some gains as short-term overbought signals appeared on the charts.  Gold also rose to its highest level since June following the U.S. inflation report. The precious metal reversed its negative correlation with bitcoin on Wednesday as seen in the chart above.  “The knee-jerk reaction to the hottest inflation reading in 30 years triggered risk aversion which was accompanied with a strong dollar and weakness across the top cryptos,” Edward Moya, an analyst at Oanda, a foreign exchange brokerage firm.  “Wall Street is quickly realizing that inflation is not fading just yet and demand for inflation hedges will remain strong into the end of the year,” Moya wrote.  Latest Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $65,916.17, -2.37%  Ether (ETH): $4,641.23, -3.04%  S&P 500: $4,464.71, -0.82%  Gold: $1,852.17, +1.23%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.563%.  Get ready for stagflation  “Our view that there has been a profound paradigm shift in the global economy: The risk of inflation being durably above official targets is now a serious risk, and it is featuring prominently in corporate and household decisions once again,” Deutsche Bank strategists wrote in a research note on Wednesday.  In response to the inflation report, Deutsche Bank lowered its near-term economic growth forecasts and said it now expects a period of “stagflation” – a period of stagnant demand and high inflation.  “For markets, financial conditions remain incredibly accommodative by historic standards, and even as break-evens [market-based inflation expectations] have risen over the last couple of months,” Deutsche Bank wrote.  Bitcoin exchange outflows continue  The supply of bitcoin on exchanges continues to decline, which could indicate a preference among investors to hold BTC in wallets instead of making their coins available to trade on exchanges.  “As a result of continued exchange outflows, the aggregate BTC exchange balance has fallen to multiyear lows of 12.9% of circulating supply,” Glassnode, a crypto data firm, wrote in a blog post.  Exchange outflows continued during BTC’s price consolidation last week, which provided a bullish signal ahead of the fresh all-time high on Wednesday.

42375875,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwCKnR,1636580831,Day 7 of Kleiman v. Wright: Wright Tells Jury Kleiman Only Mined ‘Testnet’ Bitcoins,"MIAMI — Craig Wright – best known for his long-standing and widely disputed claims to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin – told a Miami jury on Tuesday that at least a portion of the 1.1 million bitcoin the plaintiffs’ attorneys are calling “Satoshi’s hoard” were purchased, not mined.  “I purchased them from a Russian exchange,” the Australian computer scientist stated. “They were dodgy, I know, but everyone was dodgy in 2011.”  The Tulip Trust was a mysterious and perhaps, as some sleuths have speculated, non-existent offshore trust account the plaintiffs believe Wright has used to hide bitcoins. Wright told the jury the trust was created in 2011 to shelter his assets from an investigation by the Australian Tax Office (ATO). Wright said he signed over the assets in the trust, including over a million bitcoins, to Dave Kleiman, his best friend and alleged business partner who died in 2013, to protect himself from bankruptcy.  Wright added that the approximately 1.1 million bitcoins he claims to have purchased in 2011 have since been “spent” on Wright’s companies.  The plaintiffs – Dave’s brother Ira Kleiman and W&K Info Defense Research LLC, a company Ira claims Wright and Dave owned jointly to mine and “invent” bitcoin – are seeking what they claim to be Dave’s share of the bitcoins and intellectual property from their joint business venture. They have accused Wright of stealing from Dave’s estate through a complex web of legal maneuvers, shell companies and forgeries.  Read more: Craig Wright’s Latest Funhouse-Mirror Legal Adventure  Wright, for his part, maintains that he and Dave never mined or “created” bitcoin together, despite a slew of emails, chat messages and legal documents presented by the plaintiffs in which Wright tells numerous people, including Dave’s friends and family and the Australian authorities, that he and Dave had a joint mining operation.  Instead, Wright testified in court that any emails saying he and Dave mined bitcoins together were either fraudulent (Wright has long maintained that he is the victim of numerous hacks) or taken out of context.  The defense has also leaned heavily on its allegation that Wright’s autism explains both his combative demeanor and his contradictory statements. In her deposition testimony read on Monday, Wright’s wife, Ramona Watts, said the couple used to “fight every day” over misunderstandings caused by Wright’s autism.  “He is literal beyond anything,” Watts said.  Testnet bitcoins?  Wright told the jury on Monday that at least some of the bitcoins the plaintiff considers to be part of the “Satoshi stash” owed to Dave’s estate weren’t actually bitcoins at all but “testnet bitcoins” used to test a “supercomputer” that he and Dave were purportedly developing in 2011 and 2012. A testnet is an experimental environment for software under development; coins on such a network typically cannot be transferred to a live, or mainnet, version of a blockchain and so have little if any value.  Bitcoin expert Andreas Antonopoulos, who testified last week as an expert witness for the plaintiffs, told the jury that mining bitcoin could be done with an old-fashioned office computer – which he described as a “beige tower”– until 2013.  Wright also claimed that his emails to Dave’s brother Ira, his father Louis, and his friends and business partners Patrick Paige and Carter Conrad telling them that he and Dave worked together to “create” bitcoin were purposely exaggerated to give his deceased friend a legacy in the minds of his loved ones.  “I exaggerated because Dave had no one remembering him, and he was the most important person in my life for many years,” Wright tearfully told the jury, in one of his several openly emotional moments on the stand.  Read more: In Craig Wright Trial, Plaintiffs Lay Out Pattern of Fraud, Deceit and Hubris  Wright told the jury that he did mine approximately a million bitcoins on his own, however, as “Satoshi,” (Wright told the jury he mined blocks 1 through 16) and as himself after retiring the Satoshi accounts at the end of 2010.  Wright alleges that he alone mined approximately 1 million bitcoins, that Dave independently mined approximately 1 million testnet bitcoins, and that Wright purchased 1.1 million bitcoins for the supposed Tulip Trust – the similarity in the numbers is, according to Wright, a coincidence, and the plaintiff’s attorneys are “conflating” separate batches of coins.  It is important to note that, thus far, neither side has called in an expert in blockchain forensic analysis to trace the origin and movements of any of the coins in question or to give testimony on the possible ownership of any of the wallets that hold (or held) those bitcoins.

42421706,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXp9dF,1636577692,Why Shouldn’t the Navajo Mine Bitcoin?,"Navajo Nation is prime bitcoin mining country.  While Texas and Wyoming have taken the limelight since China’s bitcoin mining ban, the groundwork for bitcoin mining is already present in the American Southwest. It’s a good match, too: Bitcoin mining incentivizes healthy economic growth the Four Corners region has desperately needed for generations.  In 2017, West Block, a firm from Calgary, Alberta, approached the Navajo about building a mining center on Navajo land. Earlier this year, the Canadian firm broke ground on an extension of the mine to double in size to 15 megawatts (MW). Using energy sources from the area, the mine can spit out about 400 bitcoin per year (depending on the network conditions).  Will Foxley is the multimedia director at Compass Mining and a former tech reporter for CoinDesk. Compass Mining hosts customers’ machines at the WestBlock Capital facility.     It’s shortsighted to view bitcoins as the only output of the mine, however. The mine creates prospects for multiple avenues of societal growth, including financial access and energy usage, both of which have been long-standing thorns in the Navajos’ side, according to numerous in-person interviews with Navajo Nation members, tribal delegates and government officials conducted as part of a recent documentary on the subject.  And not in a selfish sense but wholly in a self-interested sense. Bitcoin promises a sovereignty the Navajo and others First Nations have always been promised but have never received.  The case for bitcoin  The Navajo Nation is the largest Native American reservation in the United States and the second-largest tribe by head count at around 300,000 members. It’s also one of the most impoverished communities in the U.S. A third of Navajos live under the poverty line while chronic unemployment has become the norm at around 48%.  Much of this poverty has roots in the treaty of 1868 with the U.S. government, Tribal Delegate Amber Kanazbah Crotty told Compass Mining. Its legacy is still very much alive, especially in the nation’s relationship with the banking sector, she said.  “We’re a nation working with the nation of the United States. But they will not recognize that sovereign-to-sovereign agreement when it comes to U.S. currency,” Delegate Crotty said. “They want complete control.”  This control is most often noticed in Native Americans’ underbanked status, or what is referred to as the “buckskin curtain.” In fact, Native Americans constitute the least-represented American minority group in the U.S. banking system today.  This exclusion results not just in limited opportunity, but baked in structural disadvantages involving government-to-government interactions. It is especially feared that working with the U.S. banking system could harm the institution of Navajo sovereignty, Crotty said. For example, is it in the Navajo Nation’s interest to interact with the politicized web of financial institutions backed by the dollar? Would doing so harm Navajo sovereignty as a “nation-within-a nation?”  Regardless, the Navajo remain in an odd predicament as a nation. Its citizens are liable for federal taxes to be paid in dollars, but unable to access the myriad of financial tools created for that currency 2,000 miles away on the East Coast. This situation has led to the Navajo exploring alternatives, Crotty said.  Future challenges  Bitcoin adoption isn’t without its challenges. One such difficulty bitcoin miners face is the legacy of physical mining on the reservation and a history of exploitation and unemployment around the sector among its people.  “For many decades, the coal industry provided the Navajo Nation with high-paying jobs and financial support through royalties for our many programs and initiatives,” Navajo Nation President Jonathan Nez wrote in a June 2021 letter to Congress. “Now, the mines are closed, the Navajo Generating Station (NGS) is shuttered and all we’re left with is an ecologically devastating and socially unhealthy mess that no one is stepping up to fix.”  It’s no question that bitcoin mining is a confusing subject. Any locality with a history of earth-based mining will have questions. Although similarities are present – such as high energy usage – the term “mining” is better thought of as an analogy in this case. Bitcoin mining involves no earth extraction, no long-term health consequences or damage to local water tables.  In reality, bitcoin mining is a near-perfect alternative for locations with access to high energy resources. Navajo land is full of both non-renewable and renewable resources, such as coal, hydropower, natural gas and sunlight. Moreover, bitcoin mining’s demand for low-cost reliable based load energy incentives renewable sources, the local Navajo utility said.  And this demand for renewable energy is already playing out. The Navajo mine is powered by 59% renewable energy sources. Compared that to 19% for the U.S. energy grid itself.  A digital alternative  For bitcoin, then, the question becomes one of marketing. Can the bitcoin industry convince the Navajo and other First Nations that bitcoin is not only in their interest financially but also in the best interest of their land?  From the bitcoin mining industry’s perspective, the case is clear-cut. Financially, bitcoin invites anyone to participate. Anyone can transact freely, enforce the rules with a node or even earn bitcoin by simply plugging into the network. Compare that to the incumbent financial system that has sidelined millions of Navajo since 1868. In terms of energy usage, bitcoin mining incentivizes the use of energy at the source, a key differentiator compared to past energy consumers in megacities hundreds of miles away. Moreover, bitcoin demands constant cheap energy – something the Navajo have in abundance through sunshine. The current mine is a great example, as the majority of its power is derived from renewable solar sources. In fact, it’s even incentivizing further solar build outs on the reservation by consuming a steady baseload of energy.  Yet, for now, the story remains to be played out. Bitcoin has yet to gain the trust of the lion’s share of the Navajo Nation, and education initiatives remain of importance. In the meanwhile, more mines are scheduled to come online in the coming months. And with greater bitcoin mining adoption comes greater awareness of bitcoin as an asset for self-sovereignty.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | MINING | REGULATION,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/11/10/why-shouldnt-the-navajo-mine-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4fbc45670f4e061e620d9223c98fb809091bbf83-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42375874,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwCKmB,1636573693,Polkadot DeFi Darling Acala Has Gathered Over $600M and Counting,"Polkadot decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Acala has got the crowd behind it.  The much-anticipated auctions to win places building on the Polkadot blockchain system start on Thursday, and so far Acala has already gathered some $608 million worth of DOT tokens – or more than 12 million DOT – at the time of writing, or about 1.1% of total DOT in circulation.  In the spirit of decentralization, it’s the community of DOT token holders who decide which projects will be able to lease a parachain slot. Token holders do this is by lending their DOT to a project – hence the term “crowdloan” – for a two-year lease period, for which participants are rewarded with tokens pertaining to each project.  Acala will most likely be the winner of the first slot when the seven-day auction concludes on Nov. 18. And the number of tokens being loaned to Acala is expected to keep increasing, according to the project’s chief growth officer, Dan Reecer. That’s because many DOT holders, who were previously staking their coins on Polkadot, are currently completing a 28-day “unbonding” process – basically, the un-staking of DOT from the Polkadot protocol to then contribute those tokens to a crowdloan for a given project.  “There’s still a lot of people waiting on their DOT to unbond, so there’s still plenty of DOT to come,” said Reecer in an interview with CoinDesk. “It’s going to be an exciting week and we’ll just have to see where we end up. But, yeah, we’re most likely to win the first slot.”  Acala’s DeFi plans include the release of a stablecoin on Polkadot and buildout of a decentralized exchange (DEX). Acala’s sister DeFi project Karura secured a parachain slot in this year’s auctions for Kusama, sometimes called Polkadot’s “canary network.” Reecer said having already rolled out services on Kusama will help a lot with the timeline on development work on Polkadot, which he said will be done by the first quarter of next year.  Participants in the Acala crowdloan will be rewarded with a native Acala (ACA) token to be used for network fees, staking, governance and so on, as well as a liquid crowdloan token (lcDOT) that can be used on the network as collateral while users’ DOT is locked up.  “The main complaint we were getting from people was that two years is a long time to lock up their DOT,” said Reecer. “So we built what is basically a crowdloan derivative of that. So now when people contribute through Acala they get ACA, of course, but then they also get this lcDOT, which allows them to have a liquid form of the DOT they contributed.”  The steadily increasing dollar amounts are dizzying, but the number of participants joining the Acala crowdloan – which currently stands at 61,744 – is another important number for Reecer.  “We had 20,000 unique participants for the Kusama auction, when we won the first slot by a long margin,” Reecer said. “We thought at the time that was a lot. But we have now crossed 60,000 and the auction hasn’t even started yet. So I wouldn’t be surprised if this gets over 100,000.”",POSITIVE,DOT,BLOCKCHAIN | DOT | EXCHANGE,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/11/10/polkadot-defi-darling-acala-has-gathered-over-600m-and-counting,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8bed2abe5785356a4d949e2da7952e26902aaa4e-2013x1510.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In an interview with CoinDesk TV on Wednesday, the Denmark native said that the report, which was released by the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets last week, “turned me very positive on the outlook in the U.S.”  MakerDAO issues the dai stablecoin.  Previously, Christensen was pessimistic about U.S. stablecoin regulation, warning that “we should be ready for the worst,” in a live session on Reddit last month.  The biggest fear decentralized finance (DeFi) projects faced was that regulators would fail to see the advantages of such an innovation and follow China’s example by cracking down, Christensen said, but he noted that the report makes it clear that that’s not the case.  “The potential value of decentralized technology has been recognized … It’s not just being lumped into the same box without really caring about how that could squash innovation,” Christensen said. “The report very clearly shows a recognition that there’s a difference between centralized and decentralized stablecoins.”  In regards to MakerDAO’s future in the U.S., Christensen also sounded optimistic, saying that the report “could result in MakerDAO feeling more comfortable allocating more collateral towards the U.S. economy.”  MakerDAO took a major step toward decentralizing itself in July after it reached a stage where independent core units of contributors could take over most of the tasks that were previously handled by the Maker Foundation.

42421682,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXp9Lh,1636573278,Bitcoin Politics From Left to Right and Off the Map,"In a Twitter thread yesterday, writer and speaker Dave Troy explicitly tied bitcoin to far-right American politics, calling bitcoin advocacy a “sequel to the January 6th attack” on the U.S. Capitol building in Washington, D.C.  Unsurprisingly, Troy got some blowback. At the very least, his criticism is narrow, omitting significant groups of thinkers and activists who see bitcoin, or crypto more broadly, as a potentially significant tool for projects across the political spectrum.  To show just how much Troy’s critique leaves out, what follows is a taxonomy of the various groups and tendencies that have actively embraced bitcoin. This tentative breakdown runs roughly from “left” to “right,” although the politics of bitcoin sometimes upends the traditional spectrum. My goal here is to provide a largely factual overview of these various constellations of belief rather than critique them – though as you’ll see, my magnanimity does have its limits.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Market radicals  Though I’m including them here for thoroughness, the most conventionally “leftist” major group in crypto is a cadre of egalitarian technocrats largely associated with the Ethereum blockchain rather than Bitcoin. They broadly believe that the redesign of money and markets, conducted transparently using blockchains and smart contracts, can help build a more egalitarian and fair society. Their ideas often rhyme with forms of democratic socialism and they sometimes even advocate for weakened property rights as a counterweight to economic rent-seeking.  Anti-authoritarians  Bitcoin is often tarred as inherently right-wing by those focused on America’s basically center-right political order, which already provides considerable protection of individual freedom. But many governments, historically and today, are grossly abusive and undemocratic, and in those contexts bitcoin provides an important lever for the resistance of unjust laws. Alex Gladstein of the Human Rights Foundation captures some of this sentiment with his focus on bitcoin’s potential to let individuals evade the worst abuses of authoritarians worldwide.  Anti-imperialists  Many bitcoin advocates take the even broader view that the existing global banking regime has been a tool of powerful first-world nations, and that cryptocurrency is a potential counterweight. That’s one way to interpret the embrace of bitcoin by El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele, who is well versed in the “shock doctrine” tactics used by entities like the International Monetary Fund. This high-minded financial thuggery by IMF and its ilk has served to impose extractive market neoliberalism on dozens of developing countries since World War II, and depends substantially on the centralized influence of the U.S. dollar (See also anti-war libertarians, below).  Progressives  Many prominent U.S. progressives, like Matt Stoller and Rohan Grey, are either skeptical of bitcoin or simply believe it to be a distraction from their goals. This group also includes advocates of radically expansive visions of the role of fiat currency, particularly “modern monetary theory” (MMT), the idea that governments do not actually have to limit their own spending.  But there is at least one recognizably progressive stance in favor of bitcoin: that it is a useful bulwark against identity-based discrimination. As CoinDesk contributor Isaiah Jackson has fiercely argued, the legacy banking system has been and remains deeply racist against Black people in America, making a neutral alternative potentially liberating. And while much “bank the unbanked” rhetoric in crypto is self-serving and hollow, there is substantial real-world evidence that crypto is empowering women in the developing world, which progressives should welcome.  Read more: Elizabeth Warren’s Bitcoin Blind Spot | Murtaza Hussain  ‘Alpha Bros’  Easily the largest group of bitcoin holders are those who have little or no deep political stance on it at all. Most in this group, which includes many institutional adopters and those crossing over from Wall Street, are interested strictly in bitcoin’s record of gaining value in dollar terms. I would also include many pure technocrats here, such as those interested in blockchain’s potential to improve the efficiency of cross-border payments. As researcher David Golumbia has rightly pointed out, though, both of these “apolitical” groups can be drawn towards more right-wing bitcoin rhetoric.  True libertarians  Over the past few years of American politics, many putative libertarians have been seduced by varieties of authoritarianism. But in bitcoin, there are still important figures who take a principled stand for limited government without simply defending the status-quo privileges of the already-rich. Perhaps the most compelling stance of bitcoin libertarians like Shapeshift’s Erik Voorhees is a bone-deep opposition to warmaking, which they rightly argue often depends on a government’s ability to print money indiscriminately. The idea that bitcoin can stop war may or may not withstand scrutiny, but you can see the appeal.  So-called cyber-libertarians or crypto-anarchists could also be included here. They may not share libertarian politics in the real world, but believe that cyberspace should be more or less unregulated. These ideas, famously laid out in John Perry Barlow’s “Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace,” were extremely influential on many of those who helped develop bitcoin.  Fiscal conservatives  Even if it doesn’t outright replace fiat currency, bitcoin can be thought of as a check on the central banks’ worst excesses. This is most often pitched in individual terms, with bitcoin touted as “digital gold” that will protect assets in a high-inflation environment. But at a macro level, the mere existence of bitcoin as such a hedge could have a disciplining effect on central banks, simply because citizens who see their assets taken away by inflation have an alternative for storing value.  You might roughly call this position “Bitcoin Mediumism,” and it’s particularly persuasive in contexts outside of the United States, where weaker or more short-termist governments are more likely to radically meddle with the money supply. Some restraint on sovereign debt in general may also be appealing to those concerned about record-high global levels of debt and leverage, and their role in the boom-and-bust cycle that increasingly characterizes global financial capitalism.  Neo-feudalists  The loudest and most heterodox group of bitcoiners, these are the true target of Dave Troy’s Twitter thread. Many of their ideas are intensely individualistic, anti-democratic and effectively in favor of a stark economic and political hierarchy. In some cases this is framed as a matter of grim necessity, as with the often-touted concept of “The Citadel,” a vision of the most successful capitalists becoming the kings of privatized city-states as a defense against the imminent crumbling of the neoliberal order.  These ideas also overlap considerably with so-called Bitcoin Maximalism, particularly the desire to eliminate state-backed money, and with it any social redistribution whatsoever. The dominant exposition of this worldview is Saifedean Ammous’ “The Bitcoin Standard,” a kind of bible for Maximalists (and far more nuanced and readable than you might infer from Maximalist Twitter). Though it’s getting dated and shares the blind spots of Troy’s thread, David Golumbia’s “The Politics of Bitcoin” remains an important critique of the maximalist position.  Neo-feudalism also sometimes flirts with varieties of racism, implicitly or explicitly. Among the more troubling examples is arch-reactionary Peter Thiel’s funding of the work of Curtis Yarvin, aka Mencius Moldbug, who has been accused of defending slavery.  White supremacists  At the farthest “right” of the bitcoin spectrum are vile figures including Andrew Anglin, proprietor of the Daily Stormer neo-Nazi website, who have used cryptocurrency to fund their operations. Certain tenets of bitcoin ideology also resonate uncomfortably with white supremacist talking points, particularly those involving fraudulent theories of a Jewish banking conspiracy.  However, it doesn’t necessarily follow that, as Troy seems to imply, all skepticism of fiat money-printing is inherently rooted in anti-Semitism. And by and large, racists find bitcoin convenient rather than important: They are more the object than the subject of bitcoin politics. The same technology that lets Nazis raise money after being refused service by Visa also lets Afghan women protect their savingshttps://www.yahoo.com/now/afghan-women-embracing-financial-freedom-163729862.

Bitcoin Supply Last Moved Within 30 Days Has Been Relatively Low As per the latest weekly report from Arcane Research, despite a rise in BTC&apos;s price recently, the supply moved within the last 30 days hasn&apos;t risen much. The percentage of Bitcoin supply last moved in the past 30 days is an important indicator that tells us about the liquidity of the market. Usually, when coins start aging more, they become less likely to be moved. Because of this reason, a low proportion of short-term supply implies low liquidity in the market. This can be a bullish signal for BTC. On the other hand, if a high percentage of Bitcoin supply is young, then the liquidity would be high. This may be a sign of bearish trend. Based on the trend of the indicator, it may be possible to tell whether the market is nearing a peak or not.

42375889,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwCKxV,1636569120,"Large Bitcoin Investors Take a Breather After Frantic October, US Inflation Data Eyed","Bitcoin’s uptrend continues with prices rising over 10% this month, extending October’s 40% gain and setting a new record high of over $68,000. However, institutions and large investors seem to be handing the baton over to retail investors ahead of the U.S. consumer price index data that could influence the Federal Reserve’s rate hike expectations.  While the coin stash of small bitcoin addresses continues to rise, the combined balance of addresses holding 100 to 10,000 BTC has dropped by 60,000 BTC (US$4 billion) in the past seven days, diverging from bitcoin’s continued price rally, data tracked by blockchain analytics firm Santiment shows.  “The fact that some BTC whales [large investors] may be unconvinced of the rally (at least based on non-specific address distribution) remains a yellow flag for the time being, especially given the largely upward slope of their holdings between the start of the May correction and the end of October,” Santiment said in a weekly note shared with CoinDesk early today.  Balance held by addresses holding more than 10,000 BTC has increased. However, most of these belong to crypto exchanges, Santiment noted.  Activity in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME)-listed bitcoin futures contracts has cooled recently, diverging from a continued rally in bitcoin and signaling decreased institutional participation.  The amount of money locked in bitcoin futures contracts listed on the CME has dropped to $4.6 billion, marking a 22% drawdown from the Oct. 25 peak of $5.5 billion, per data provided by Skew.  According to Arcane Research, the number of open contracts on CME, when excluding the BITO contracts, is down 45% since its Oct 25 peak. The ProShares bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) launched on Oct. 18 on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker BITO invests in regulated CME-based bitcoin futures in a bid to mimic the cryptocurrency’s performance.  The decline in open interest on the CME suggests that institutional traders are less active in the market now compared to late October, Arcane Research’s weekly note published Tuesday said.  The CME-based futures, particularly the regular ones with a contract size of 5 BTC, are considered a proxy for institutional activity. Open interest on the CME surged by 185% in October on speculation about an imminent futures-based ETF.  Bitcoin futures open interest on Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency retail exchange by trading volume, has increased by 16% to a record high of $6.6 billion in the past two weeks.  With large traders taking a backseat to retail investors, bitcoin’s bullish momentum may slow. The cryptocurrency was last seen trading largely unchanged on the day near $66,900, having dipped by 0.9% on Tuesday.  Bitcoin is widely perceived as a store of value asset and may pick up a strong bid if the U.S. inflation data scheduled for release at 13:30 UTC bolsters fears of price pressures moving out of control.  “Consensus is looking at a jump from 5.4% to 5.9% in the headline rate, with core expected to advance from 4.0% to 4.3%,” ING analysts said in a blog post published early Wednesday. “Inflation at 6% is set to offer more ground to the Fed’s hawkish members to keep raising concerns about the risks of acting too late or doing too little on monetary tightening.”  Readers, however, should note that a bullish move in bitcoin may remain elusive if the higher inflation number revives fears of faster interest rate hikes by the Fed, sending the dollar, short-duration bond yields higher and equity markets lower. The S&P 500 futures were pointing to mild risk aversion at press time with a 0.3% drop.  “Today, we think the risks are skewed towards a positive reaction by the dollar, as slightly below-consensus numbers (but still higher than last month) should not be enough to cause any dovish re-pricing in rate expectations – which are already less hawkish than the Fed’s median Dot Plot [interest rate projections] – while a close-to or above 6% read could prompt markets to bring forward the pricing for the start of the Fed’s” ING said, adding that the dollar index, or DXY, may rise back towards Friday’s 94.60 by the end of this week.  While the Fed announced the beginning of the gradual unwinding of liquidity-boosting bond purchases last week, it stuck to its view of inflation being transitory, calming fears of an early interest rate hike. Fed’s record money-printing program running since March 2020 has inspired investors to buy bitcoin and just about every asset denominated in dollars. As such, monetary tightening poses risks to asset prices.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/11/10/large-bitcoin-investors-take-a-breather-after-frantic-october-us-inflation-data-eyed,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8c02bda1bb0b2955783ed628af42b2c26a8a9764-1028x480.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42410943,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggtjVg,1636566488,LUNA Hits All-Time High as Terra Community Passes Popular Burn Proposal,"The Terra community on Tuesday night passed a popular proposal to burn about 88.7 million terra (LUNA) tokens, worth roughly $4.5 billion at current prices, and mint about 4 million to 5 million terraUSD (UST) stablecoins, a decision that should further boost the Terra project, according to analysts.  The “burning,” or permanent removal of the tokens from circulation, will be executed over the next two weeks, with an initial burn of 520,000 LUNA that already took place Tuesday night. At press time, LUNA was changing hands at $53.74, up 7.03% in the past 24 hours, according to TradingView and Binance. Its price set a new record high $54.95 at around 11 a.m. ET (16:00 UTC) Wednesday.  Initiated by Terra’s co-founder Do Kwon, the measure aims to fund new services in the Terra ecosystem, including Ozone, an insurance protocol that “facilitates levered coverage of technical failure risks” in any decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol built on Terra, according to a community post by Kwon. It also marks one of the largest burns of a major layer 1 token in crypto history, according to Terra’s official Twitter account.  “A large portion of the burn – $1 million and more – will go towards capitalizing a new insurance protocol for the Terra ecosystem called Ozone,” Ryan Watkins, research analyst at Messari, said. “This is an important piece of the ecosystem that should promote more safety for users.”  The decentralized finance (DeFi) sector has been facing a growing number of hacks of late. Data from Rekt shows that DeFi protocols have suffered more than 50 hacks worth over $1 million in the past two years.  Terra blockchain is the fourth largest smart contract platform by total value locked (TVL) at $11.36 billion, according to data from DeFi Llama. TVL is the total value of the cryptocurrency committed to DeFi protocols that are built on a layer 1 blockchain.  LUNA is part of an algorithmic balancing system that helps stablecoins running on the Terra blockchain maintain parity with fiat currencies.  There were some initial doubts among those in the Terra community around the burning proposal, as shown in the proposal’s page. Some users asked whether burning nearly 89 million LUNA was too much.  Terra’s Kwon told CoinDesk that the burning proposal was also intended to reduce the amount of wealth in Terra’s community pool.  “At the [fully diluted market value] of the network at almost $40 billion, I think having a community pool that is too large is actually a systemic risk,” Kwon said in a Twitter message to CoinDesk. “I believe community funds should be just large enough to pay for public services. ... But a DAO [decentralized autonomous organization] doesn’t need billions of dollars to operate.”  Before Terra’s Columbus-5 upgrade at the end of September, the community pool was set to receive $1 worth of LUNA from users when UST traded above $1. In return, users would receive 1 UST. The Columbus-5 upgrade also shifts the design to burning LUNA: Whenever UST is minted, LUNA with the same amount of value is burned instead of going to the community pool.  The burning will also ultimately benefit LUNA stakers, said Jeremy Ong, vice president of business operations at crypto research boutique firm Delphi Digital.  “LUNA stakers have less competition as [they] don’t have to compete against the community pool,” Ong said.",POSITIVE,LUNA,BLOCKCHAIN | LUNA | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/11/10/terra-passes-highly-anticipated-proposal-to-burn-nearly-89m-luna,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/66a065c348d0ed391405e8ff4b3cded139f35c36-1177x700.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The shares recently pared their drop to trade at $339 by publication time.  Some Wall Street analysts are taking a longer-term view of the crypto exchange. That stance backs Coinbase’s view that cryptocurrency volatility and rising prices in recent months should feed through to an increase in its transacting users and trading volumes in the fourth quarter.  Still, the decline in retail trading revenue divided by retail trading volumes is keeping Mizuho cautious. “Most significantly, 3Q saw a dramatic decline in the retail take rate, likely among the most dramatic compression in COIN’s short history as a public company,” analyst Dan Dolev wrote to clients in a note. Dolev maintains a neutral rating and $300 price target.  MoffettNathanson sees a bright spot in revenue from Coinbase’s subscription and services, or non-trading services, which rose 41% from the previous quarter. Analyst Lisa Ellis sees the “expansion of these services as the most notable source of upside to Coinbase’s financial performance” over the next three to five years. Ellis maintains a buy rating and $600 price target.  Needham is also looking ahead to different product launches, such as non-fungible tokens (NFT). “We continue to be positive on revenue diversification and new product launches (NFTs, futures, additional staking opportunities),” analyst John Todaro told clients in a note. Needham maintains its buy recommendation and $420 price target.  Coinbase should benefit from overall crypto adoption, JPMorgan said. “We see Coinbase continuing to outpace peers and still see the company as a strong investment based on continued growth of the cryptoeconomy,” analyst Kenneth Worthington wrote.

These types of trades could help traditional financial institutions to enter the burgeoning cryptocurrency market, according to the press release from London-based B2C2 and Singapore-based QCP.  “Unlike a deliverable forward, an NDF provides exposure to the underlying asset without the need to take physical delivery,” the companies said. The underlying asset in the transaction was bitcoin (BTC), denominated in U.S. dollars. The amount of the transaction wasn’t disclosed.  The crypto NDF will provide exposure to cryptocurrencies through a standardized instrument that is widely traded in foreign exchange markets, often on emerging-markets trading desks, the statement said.  “QCP views NDFs as a gateway to crypto markets for traditional financial institutions, such as investment banks, that are currently unable to handle the underlying assets,” Darius Sit, a co-founder of QCP Capital, said in the press release.  Previously, traditional market participants have been able to gain exposure to bitcoin via the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and regulated futures listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Last month, U.S. regulators approved a bitcoin futures-based exchange-traded fund (ETF). Grayscale is owned by Digital Currency Group, which is also CoinDesk’s parent company.  NDFs are popular in foreign exchange markets, especially for clients operating in countries with a non-convertible or partially convertible currency like the Indian rupee. Partial convertibility refers to the freedom to convert domestic currency into foreign currency and vice versa when a country limits how much of its currency can leave or enter the country in capital accounts.  The largest NDF markets are in the Chinese yuan, Indian rupee, South Korean won, New Taiwan dollar and Brazilian real, according to a report published by the Bank for International Settlements.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | SPONSORED | TRADING,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/11/10/crypto-trading-firm-b2c2-launches-cryptos-first-non-deliverable-forward,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d13911e938c8f4f1ce0fa03102b730c21a875874-4082x3061.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Following the attack on Sunday, the attackers were initially demanding a ransom payment of $240 million, Bleeping Computer reported Monday.  A subsequent report by retail news site RetailDetail said the amount had been reduced to $50 million, with payment demanded in bitcoin.  The attack by the Hive ransomware group encrypted MediaMarkt’s servers, causing the retailer to shut down its IT systems to prevent further problems. That caused many stores, mainly in the Netherlands, to be unable to accept credit and debit card payments.  Germany-based MediaMarkt has more than 1,000 stores across the continent.  Recent research by the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) found that payments linked to ransomware attacks this year have amounted to $590 million so far, already exceeding the total for all of 2020. It isn’t clear what proportion of those transactions involve crypto.  Hive’s modus operandi involves gaining access to a network to steal encrypted files, while also deleting backups to prevent the target from being able to recover their data. Hive has also been known to steal files and publish them on its data leaks site unless a ransom is paid, according to Bleeping Computer’s report.  Read more: Crypto Isn’t the Cause of Ransomware.

42421693,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXp9Tx,1636556515,The Trash Moat: When the Media Lies About Crypto,"No one said understanding crypto would be easy – the technology is complicated, the slang impenetrable, the interfaces in need of improving. Sending an on-chain transaction for the first time is hard enough without having those you trust – the media, your entertainers – distracting you with scams or misdirections.  The committed heavy users of crypto have largely learned to tune that out, but for those outside the Citadel or Crypto City, much of the information they consume is a veritable trash moat. By that, I mean the dubious promotions of meme coins and the content creators looking to cash in on crypto with paid-in-kind endorsements.  Dr. Paul Dylan-Ennis is an assistant professor in the College of Business, University College Dublin.  There is a gap of quality information regarding this nascent industry that has money and intrigue enough to capture the attention of Average Joes – a gap that hucksters are only too willing to exploit.  What happens in the trash moat rarely reaches the shores of mainstream crypto. It occurs in the sweet spot just beyond the attention of the clued-in observer, who is typically focused on high-minded talk of regulation, venture capital funding and whatever is currently hot, like non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and yet it happens right there in public.  What happens when you dredge the channels? As a pioneer in trash moat dredging, I find two types of detritus tend to bubble up: red-top coverage and YouTube influencers.  Let’s start with red-top coverage. Red tops are cheap and popular tabloid newspapers. Most crypto observers get their news from a combination of industry news websites, Crypto Twitter and Telegram groups. That means they are oblivious to the fact that Safecoin is important enough to have its own section in The Express. Or that The Sun dedicates most of its coverage to shiba inu. While serious folk spend their time solemnly debating whether journalists should own crypto, the wily red topper turns the Average Joe onto the next Dogecoin clone.  Unfortunately, this practice has on occasion even spread to such venerable institutions as the British Broadcasting Corp. After all, the trash moat preys on the gap between total immersion, those who know their Taproot from their Arbitrum, and those on a day trip, who are just visiting and might not know all the tourist traps.  Much of the trash filling the moat is comprised of YouTube influencer scams. Those seem to almost entirely escape the notice of the crypto media. Logan Paul (5 million subscribers), for instance, has explicitly endorsed a “shitcoin” (his words) called Dink Doink that trades at $0.000000000045 and seems to have simply been abandoned by Paul and the developers, as if it never happened.  For Paul’s fans, this is what crypto now means: a pump-and-dump scheme where everyone thinks “well, that’s just crypto!” You won’t be surprised to learn that Paul also created an NFT project called CryptoZoo that was so lazy it used stock images, rather than original art.  Arguably the most egregious example of the YouTube Crypto hustle – and there are many to choose from – was Save The Kids coin. That coin, on crypto’s version of Mad Max, the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), was presented as a charity venture and had the backing of an extremely impressive roster of YouTube influencers, including four members of FaZe Clan, a professional esports and entertainment organization. On launch, most of the influencers involved sold their tokens immediately or “rugged” the users. It caused enough of a scandal that the four involved members were suspended or fired. That happened only because of the dogged investigative work of YouTube detective Coffeezilla. Coffeezilla is also known to cover scandals close to home, such as his video on Tether (900,000 views).  For an entire generation that gets its content from YouTube, crypto is encountered more as a Coffeezilla exposé than the cultured vibes of a Web 3 conference. Crypto is when your celebrity hero rugs you the day after you learn how to use PancakeSwap.  What does the moat tell us about contemporary crypto? The moat phenomenon is almost certainly a byproduct of the wider diffraction of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. It is now impossible to cover the industry in any comprehensive sense. Journalists, researchers and critics alike all must choose their lane. Once there, they deepen this specialist knowledge until the entry points disappear.  See also: Balaji Srinivasan: Bitcoin and the Search for Truth  That leaves the Average Joe in a precarious position. To enter the Citadel (or Crypto City), they must first cross the moat, but the crossing is dangerous, the support beams weak. If they fall in, they might get swept along and never heard from again. They are still in crypto, but in some twisted, late-night casino version, populated entirely by speed freaks and con men.  And really, what is on offer with the trash moat is an old confidence trick, the pig in a poke. In that scam, the con man turns up in the village and offers a discounted pig in a small sack (a poke). Blinded by the allure of securing a cheap pig, someone will inevitably buy it fast – before someone else does! – before checking the bag. The con man slips away and the villager opens the bag to discover a cat (“letting the cat out of the bag”).  Today the trick is selling meme coins as real coins, leaving our poor Average Joe holding the bag.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | SHIB | ARB | BNB,Paul J.

Zebec Protocol’s first application is Zebec Payroll, a tax compliant on-chain processing system that allows workers to be paid by the second based on their pay rate in USDC or other stablecoins. Employees have the option to withdraw all of the money, automatically convert a portion of their paycheck into top cryptocurrencies or allocate funds to compliant crypto IRA and 401k account.  How it works  Payers connect with Zebec using Phantom Wallet, enter the recipient’s wallet address and then start streaming the funds. The recipient receives the funds in their stream wallet and can withdraw the balance to turn it into real-world cash. Throughout the process, Zebec handles the money completely on-chain.  The Solana blockchain can power up to 50,000 transactions per second for relatively low fees. Zebec says a new cash stream on the protocol can be established in minutes for a Solana transaction, or “gas,” fee of a fraction of a cent.  “What we are basically enabling is making money continuous,” Zebec CEO Sam Thapaliya told CoinDesk in an interview. “Imagine I send you $100 over 10 days, and you’re receiving money every single second. It makes money programmable. It makes money a continuous flow and enables completely new possibilities for how money can function in the world.”  Funding round  The funding round led by Republic Capital, Shima Capital and Breyer Capital with participation from Resolute Ventures, Launchpad Capital, Backend Capital, Meltem Demirors, Gemini Frontier Fund, Infinity Ventures Crypto, Wave 7, Cadenza Ventures, Hack VC and Joe McCann. Thapaliya told CoinDesk that half of the funding will go towards increasing Zebec’s developer ecosystem. The rest will help get the product out as fast as possible and with as many features as possible.  “The growth of the digital economy has been hindered by a lack of tax-compliant, frictionless payment processing technologies. Zebec finally makes it easy for anyone to send and receive cash in real time without intermediaries, delays or risks of non payment,” said Republic Capital co-founder and Managing Director Christian Sullivan in the press release.  What’s next  Zebec’s near-term plans include getting the product out, a private sale in December and a public sale in February, Thapaliya said. The company is also gearing up for its SHIP 2021 hackathon, sponsored by the Solana Foundation, which encourages developers and hackers to build products on the protocol.  The ultimate goal is to take Zebec global. Thapaliya was born during the civil war in Nepal and grew up without access to bank accounts.  “I lived through a couple of dictators, a couple of communist rulers. And the one thing that was not there for us was bank accounts,” Thapaliya said.  “I hope to make [this product] global so that one day everyone in the world is able to get access to capital in real time without middlemen withholding money and taking cuts,” he added.

The Consumer Price Index for all items rose 6.2% in the 12 months through October, the highest since 1990. Economists had projected an increase in the October CPI of 5.9% over the past 12 months.  Inflation is closely tracked by cryptocurrency traders because many bitcoin investors say the digital asset – whose supply is limited by the underlying blockchain’s programming – can serve as a hedge against rising prices.  Bitcoin’s price has more than doubled this year, supporting a broad rally in cryptocurrencies where the total market value of all digital tokens recently topped $3 trillion for the first time.  The bitcoin price hit an all-time high close to $69,000 on Wednesday after the report. As of press time the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was changing hands around $68,568.84, up 2.5% over the past 24 hours.  Economists say that supply-chain bottlenecks, shipping constraints and even limited warehouse space as the coronavirus pandemic retreats might be helping to fuel higher prices. That’s in addition to a tight labor market that has put upward pressure on wages. Companies often try to pass these extra costs along to consumers in the form of higher retail prices.  There’s also speculation that the trillions of dollars of money-printing over the past couple years by the Federal Reserve and other central banks might be contributing to dollar debasement – further supporting the investment case for bitcoin because its supply is tightly controlled.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Bradley Keoun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/11/10/us-inflation-surges-faster-than-expected-to-3-decade-high-cpi-report-shows,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ec760f040a1f0d136e83ce3e89f830ea86028083-1440x1081.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The U.K. university has established the Cambridge Centre for Carbon Credits where computer scientists and conservation scientists will work together on the project.  The center will look at how the purchase of carbon credits can be used to fund nature-based solutions preserving biodiversity.  The marketplace will be built on the Tezos blockchain, chosen because it is a sustainable option.  A carbon credit is a permit that allows the holder to emit a certain amount of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gas, such as methane.  The Cambridge project joins other blockchain climate initiatives announced in the run-up to the COP26 conference in Glasgow, Scotland as concern over global climate change has mounted. In July, China introduced a carbon trading system, to be followed by a token-based carbon neutrality project in Singapore in September.  Experts at the conference on Wednesday said there is more support for climate action using blockchain technology. Among other initiatives, the GloCha United Citizens Organization for Action for Climate Empowerment was announced as a blockchain-technology based quasi-international organization. It will be based in Austria.  Another initiative launched at the COP26 is a quasi-international organization located in Austria, called the GloCha United Citizens Organization for Action for Climate Empowerment. The group is looking to utilize blockchain technology to advance climate change objectives in alignment with the United Nations.  Earlier this month, the crypto exchange BitMEX bought $100,000 worth of carbon credits, representing 7,110 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions, enough to offset its bitcoin carbon footprint for the next year.

Das added that 70% or more of participants had only invested around INR 1,000-INR 3,000 (US$13-$40).  The central bank governor was responding to recent suggestions that adoption of crypto was among the highest in the world with some 7.3% of the population owning cryptocurrency.  Crypto is a “very serious concern” for the RBI owing to matters of macroeconomic and financial stability, Das had previously said in the interview.

YGG is a gaming guild that assembles players who can then earn rewards via blockchain-based economies. A guild makes play-to-earn games accessible by covering initiation costs in exchange for a revenue-sharing agreement.  Genopets said YGG has bought Genopets governance tokens (GENE) worth $25,000 and will be producing YGG-branded Habitat NFTs worth $50,000 to initiate scholars in the Genoverse. Genopets’ guild model allows players to rent a “habitat,” which is the entry level item required to expedite the earning process.  “Genopets is offering a different kind of gaming experience to YGG’s growing community, that will allow our guild members to move while they play and earn,” YGG co-founder Gabby Dizon said.  While guilds most commonly exist in the GameFi space as third-party platforms, Genopets says building the guild directly into a game makes the process more efficient because of the use of smart contracts.  “Some of these guilds are literally using spreadsheets to keep track of their players’ earnings,” Jay Chang, co-founder of Genopets, told CoinDesk in an interview. “Our system saves everyone time, and lets the guilds focus more on other things, like the educational component.”  Genopets’ completed an $8.3 million funding round in October led by Konvoy Ventures and Pantera Capital.

42410949,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggtjmD,1636547400,How’s ‘Zelda’ Doing? Our Ethereum Validator Check-In,"With the progress being made on the Beacon Chain over the past few weeks, I wanted to use this week’s newsletter to give an overview of the CoinDesk validator and its brief history.  About nine months ago when ether was just $1,600, the CoinDesk team deposited 32 ETH to the staking contract to launch our very own Beacon Chain validator, dubbed “Zelda.” Since then, we’ve gained access to insights across the Beacon Chain and the responsibilities that come alongside securing the proof-of-stake network.  This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum 2.0 and its sweeping impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to Valid Points here.  While this newsletter showcases weekly graphic updates on the validator’s progress, we wanted to provide a few written takeaways of our results. Furthermore, it’s easy to track our day-to-day activity and rewards on beaconcha.in.  Our total reward balance as of Monday is 1.6165 ETH, averaging 0.0061 ETH in rewards per day. While we have a current estimated annual percentage rate (APR) of 6.97%, new validators will continue to come online and lower the returns until they reach an optimized floor of 3%.  Validator rewards mainly come from participating in three events:  Attestations: “A validator vote for a Beacon Chain or shard block. Validators must attest to blocks, signaling that they agree with the state proposed by the block.”  Block Proposals: “A randomly selected validator is tasked with proposing a new block every slot (12 seconds).”  Sync Committees: “A sync committee is a group of 512 validators, randomly assigned by the Ethereum 2.0 network. A new committee is chosen every 256 epochs, roughly 27 hours.”  Zelda has executed 59,363 attestations and missed only 129. Our missed attestations were mostly a result of a delayed upgrade to Altair, which was promptly solved so that attesting could resume within hours of the upgrade.  Block proposals are few and far between for individual validators because only 7,200 blocks are produced each day and more than 256,000 validators are live on the Beacon Chain, giving Zelda a 2.8% chance of getting a block proposal each day. In fact, we had zero proposals between June 2 and Oct. 5. Thankfully, Zelda has resumed cranking out block proposals, with two during the last month.  Although block proposals outweigh attestations in one-time rewards, over the lifetime of a validator attestations become much more important. Post-Altair, Zelda’s breakdown should consist of 84% attestation rewards, 12.5% block proposal rewards and 3.5% sync committee rewards.  We’ll continue to include weekly Zelda updates in this newsletter, and we’ll provide a deeper dive on our performance to offer a look at our relative validator standings as we get closer to the impending Merge!  Welcome to another edition of Valid Points.  Pulse check  The following is an overview of network activity on the Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain over the past week. For more information about the metrics featured in this section, check out our 101 explainer on Eth 2.0 metrics.  Disclaimer: All profits made from CoinDesk’s Eth 2.0 staking venture will be donated to a charity of the company’s choosing once transfers are enabled on the network.  Validated takes  Venture capital firm Sequoia Capital made a token investment in Parallel, a Polkadot-based lending project. BACKGROUND: Venture capital firms have had differing stances on token and equity investing, causing negative reactions from crypto users and natives. Parallel plans to give the token utility through governance and transaction fees, offering token investors a chance to play a vital role in the ecosystem.  FTX, Lightspeed and Solana Ventures started an initiative to invest $100 million in Web 3 gaming. BACKGROUND: Blockchain-based gaming has gained traction in both the crypto and gaming communities alongside the rise in non-fungible tokens and the Axie Infinity video game. While scalability and user experience have been a bump in the road for a lot of projects, play-to-earn and in-game ownership have piqued the interest of gamers around the world.  Reddit further detailed its plans to launch on Arbitrum, a popular layer 2 scaling platform for Ethereum. BACKGROUND: An engineer from Reddit’s crypto team announced the company’s goal of decentralizing social media and onboarding 500 million users into crypto. A vision shared by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and Reddit is tokenization’s ability to share ownership, reward positive behavior and allow for community-driven innovation.  Rocket Pool, a decentralized Eth 2.0 staking service, launched on Monday. BACKGROUND: Similar to other staking pools, Rocket Pool increases accessibility to Ethereum staking to those with fewer than 32 ETH or with lesser technical capabilities. Rocket Pool, however, is also completely trustless and has zero reliance on third parties or multisig wallets. The project also allows stakers to choose their client, which I hope will lead to further diversity across the Beacon Chain.  Factoid of the week  Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) on Ethereum have facilitated over $1 trillion in trades over the past 12 months. Uniswap was largely responsible for the adoption, with over $500 million in volume alone.  Open comms  Valid Points incorporates information and data about CoinDesk’s own Eth 2.0 validator in weekly analysis. All profits made from this staking venture will be donated to a charity of our choosing once transfers are enabled on the network.

Electricity has been in short supply in the fossil fuel-dependent Kazakhstan following an influx of miners this year. The national grid operator KEGOC has been rationing power to miners since September, and the government has proposed a bill that would cap the supply of power provided through the national grid to new mines to 100 megawatts.  Mirzagaliyev called on the lawful miners to jointly search for “solutions to ensure the reliability of the unified electric power system.”  Local blockchain and data center industry associations said they are prepared to import electricity and invest in renewable energy projects.  Alan Dordzhiev, chairman of the Association of the Blockchain and Data Center and Technology Industry, said the government and private sector should work together to fight “gray” miners, mostly in the southern parts of Kazakhstan, that tap into the grid without proper approval.  At the meeting, the ministries of energy and digital development, the Kazakhstan Association of Blockchain Technologies and the Association of Blockchain and Data Center and Technology Industry, as well as KEGOC signed a protocol to prevent electricity rationing, develop demand reforms to balance the energy market, and attract investment for renewable energy projects.  Kazakhstan has emerged as the world’s number two bitcoin miner behind the U.S., after China’s crackdown on crypto this May. The crypto industry is expected to bring in 500 billion tenge (US$1.16 billion) within the next five years, according to the ministry statement.

Huobi claims to be expanding its overseas presence to make up for expelling Chinese users, which represent half of its total user base and 30% of its revenue, according to co-founder Du Jun and Global Strategy Director Jeff Mei.  After China’s central bank launched yet another crackdown on crypto trading, Huobi announced it will be phasing out mainland China accounts by the end of 2021.  Singapore, known as a crypto hub, has been included in Huobi’s list of restricted jurisdictions, the statement said. The exchange advised users to withdraw their funds and close their positions before the end of March.  Users from the U.S., Canada, Cuba, Iran, Japan, North Korea, Sudan, Syria, Venezuela and Crimea are also prohibited from trading on the platform, according to a July 26 user agreement. However, Singapore was also included on that list.  Huobi did not provide any further details.  Dozens of crypto firms have applied for Singapore’s Payment Services Act (PSA) licenses, including Binance’s local affiliate. Huobi has also applied for a digital token payment license under PSA through its local affiliate Feu International, according to the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) website.  Huobi had moved swathes of its staff to the city-state over the summer in preparation for a renewed crackdown in China, CoinDesk reported.  Feu International is a wholly owned subsidiary of Huobi Tech, a Hong Kong-listed company that is separate from Huobi Global, according to Huobi Tech’s annual report for 2020.
