42434468,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPDNTh,1622234922,"Market Wrap: Bitcoin Slides to $35K, ETH to $2.4K on Biden, Environmental Bearishness","Bearish news is causing the crypto market to dip and uncertainty reigns as to when prices might pick up again.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $35,889 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Slipping 7.6% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $35,453-$39,053 (CoinDesk 20)  Ether (ETH) trading around $2,506 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). In the red 9.3% over the previous 24 hours.  Ether’s 24-hour range: $2,443-$2,784 (CoinDesk 20)  Bitcoin dumps on doubt    Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was down Friday by 7.6% as of press time. BTC was below the 10-hour moving average and the 50-hour, a bearish signal for market technicians.      The price of BTC fell from $39,053 at 22:30 UTC (6:30 p.m. ET) Thursday to as low as $35,453 by 12:00 UTC (8:00 a.m. ET) Friday, a 9.2% slip based on CoinDesk 20 data.      Fundamental crypto market bearishness, including uncertainty about bitcoin as an inflation hedge after U.S. President Joe Biden's administration released a $6 trillion budget plan as well as continuing concerns about bitcoin mining causing damage to the environment likely led to selling Friday.      “It could be a difficult weekend for crypto investors,” said David Russell, vice president of market intelligence at brokerage TradeStation Group. “The mid-May sell-off left some technical scars that may need time to heal. Bitcoin is under $40,000 and dragging on the space.”      On May 23, bitcoin fell to a one-month low of $33,140, according to CoinDesk 20 data.

Over 8,000 calls with a notional value of $305 million are at that six-digit strike, according to Deribit data.      “You can see there's even a $400,000 strike, which is ridiculous,” said Nathan Cox, chief investment officer of crypto fund Two Prime.      Diving deeper, data aggregator Genesis Volatility provides implied volatility metrics based on Deribit data of expirations. On the June 11 expiration, for example, the skew is bearish, seen by a large amount of implied volatility oriented at the $20,000 strike price.      However, when looking deep into the future, implied volatility skews mega-bullish at a $400,000 strike for the March 23, 2022 expiration.      It’s a short-term bearish outlook but long-term hyper bull mode for options traders, according to Cox. And he believes there may be more downside ahead before a reversal.      “So it's like, yes, we all believe in the macro case for bitcoin,” Cox told CoinDesk. “But the question is, how do you trade it right now? And the answer is maybe a little bit more nuanced than what most think, which is, strap in because we're not done yet.”    Ether volumes above bitcoin for third straight day    The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether, was trading around $2,506 as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET), slipping 9.3% over the prior 24 hours. The asset is below the 10-hour moving average but above the 50-hour, a sideways signal for market technicians.      Ether dipped from $2,784 at 22:00 UTC (6:00 p.m. ET) Thursday to $2,443 by 12:00 UTC (8:00 a.m. ET) Friday, an 8.2% dump based on CoinDesk 20 data. ETH has since gone up and down but settled higher, $2,506 as of press time.      Spot ether volumes were higher than bitcoin for the third straight day on Thursday, based on the last available data from CoinDesk Research. BTC’s $40 million tally Thursday was 8% lower than ether’s $44 million in trading volume, a sign traders are continuing to find highly liquid crypto opportunities outside of bitcoin.      While this development might concern some long-term bitcoin holders, Nick Mancini, a research analyst for signals firm Trade the Chain, pointed out that BTC dominance, or its share of the overall cryptocurrency ecosystem, is steady – it’s actually up by 0.30% as of press time Friday.      “If bitcoin dominance continues to rise we expect BTC to lead the way for ETH and other large-caps,” Mancini said. “And we expect both ETH and BTC sentiment and price action to stay correlated through the weekend.”    A use case for bitcoin: Ethereum    Over 230,000 BTC as of press time is “wrapped” on Ethereum, a record high. Wrapped bitcoin is held in escrow in a custody wallet, and tokens are created on the Ethereum network to represent that value and deployed across various decentralized finance, or DeFi, applications like lending, trading and derivatives.      At over 184,000 bitcoin, the most popular wrapped project is wBTC. It’s a joint effort of BitGo, Kyber Network and Republic protocol, according to the white paper.      Brian Mosoff, chief executive officer of Ether Capital, says wrapped bitcoin is hitting records because of BTC’s continuing digital gold and treasury narratives, and that this particular technology could become of interest to financial incumbents over time.      “These are brand-new systems and pieces of software,” said Mosoff. “Watching a global community address these issues in a decentralized way, making the tooling more robust, will lead to prime time when traditional finance is ready to plug in their infrastructure and bridge the two worlds.”      Read More: Uniswap Holders Vote to Deploy on Ethereum Scaler Arbitrum    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are all lower Friday.

42434454,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPDN3h,1622234380,Has COVID-19 Made Biden’s Big Spending the New Normal?,"President Joe Biden today unveiled a budget proposal that would increase U.S. federal spending to levels not seen since World War II. As usual, the new president’s proposed budget has already triggered a fierce debate. But while we can expect the usual scrum over spending details, the Biden budget is an attempt to push forward and leverage a much broader ideological shift. The coronavirus pandemic has made government spending and programs significantly more appealing to Americans.      It’s something of a perfect storm. The budget arrives after coronavirus pandemic relief proved hugely popular and seemingly effective. Longer-term rising inequality and other serious social problems have created more space for pro-government voices like U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders. Meanwhile, conservative deficit hawks have been marginalized by the rise of Donald Trump. That creates a scenario friendly to the return of big government.    David Z. Morris is CoinDesk's chief insights columnist.    But, of course, all that comes with a cost. An increasing embrace of government spending could not only lead to a long-term debt hangover, but could also fuel rising inflation. That could further increase interest in one of the major arguments for bitcoin: that it can act as an inflation hedge against currencies like the dollar. Rising inflation was a key factor in investor Ray Dalio’s recent endorsement of bitcoin at CoinDesk’s Consensus 2021 event this week. The idea is still relatively untested, especially in the U.S., but Americans’ shifting attitudes and Biden’s legislative agenda could create a real-world showcase of how bitcoin responds to rising government spending, debt and inflation.      The Biden budget would increase discretionary spending for 2022 by 8.4%, according to The Wall Street Journal, and overall nondefense spending would rise 16%. The proposed budget for 2022 would total $6 trillion. Biden also lays out proposed spending for the next decade, which according to the Congressional Budget Office would push U.S. federal debt to 117% of GDP by 2031, a level widely considered risky to an economy. Notably, the Trump administration’s pre-pandemic tax cuts and spending had already had a similar effect, setting a course for the same level of debt by 2035.      Instead of tanks and bombers for fighting Nazis, Biden’s big spending push would be focused on improving Americans’ lives (the military budget would barely grow). Proposals include subsidized child care, tuition-free community college, paid leave for workers and big spending on transportation and utility system upgrades. The budget would also increase government revenue by increasing the capital gains tax, and restoring corporate tax rates and some personal income tax rates to pre-Trump levels.    Read more: Biden’s 2022 Budget Includes New Crypto Reporting Proposals    None of this is law yet and, realistically, much of it never will be. The White House budget proposal is largely a symbolic document, a way for an administration to signal what it wants – whether or not it can actually get it. Though Democrats technically have control of Congress, their ability to get legislation through depends on the support of centrist Democrat senators Kristin Sinema of Arizona and Joe Manchin of West Virginia. That’s just one reason there will likely be a lot of compromises as proposals become reality.      What’s really significant about the Biden proposal may be less its individual provisions than how it reflects major shifts in thinking about government spending. The Biden administration is framing its proposal as a strategic investment in the future of America, arguing that high spending now on things like infrastructure and education will create growth down the line. That’s been a tough argument to make in America during the past half-century of ideological dominance by the conservative stance that lower taxes and less spending are the best way to grow the economy.      But Biden’s case for public investment comes at a moment when Americans suddenly appear much more receptive to it. Most obviously, the coronavirus pandemic shrank the U.S. economy by 3.5% last year, creating an opportunity for accelerated government spending to pick up economic slack. This “Keynesian” approach to recessions was already put into action under President Trump, whose Treasury Secretary Stephen Mnuchin championed a nearly $1 trillion emergency relief program.      American support for that and subsequent relief programs has been high, even among Republicans who have long opposed such spending. That reflects another shift that seems likely to make deficit-fueled spending more popular: The rise of Donald Trump as the effective leader of the Republican Party has reduced the traction of traditional conservative ideas, including balanced budgets.      That big-spending approach to economic relief has already shown success: Despite shrinking dramatically for the year, the U.S. economy actually grew at a more than 4% annualized rate in the last quarter of 2020, and 6.4% in the first quarter of 2021. U.S. GDP is now expected to exceed pre-pandemic levels by the end of June. The usual point of comparison here is with the 2008 financial crisis, when some argue a more limited federal relief effort led to sluggish growth that dragged on for nearly half a decade. It’s not an entirely apples-to-apples comparison because of the deep structural roots of the financial crisis, but many Americans appear to have taken the contrast as a vindication of Keynesian deficit spending.      The success of relief programs so far, of course, is also the argument against continued high government spending: Maybe we’ve already done enough, and the economy is well on its way to being fine. In addition to recovering GDP, for instance, the standard measure of unemployment now stands at just 6.5%, down from a terrifying 17% in April of 2020. Continued high government deficit spending into a relatively healthy economy, critics say, risks causing higher inflation. Inflation has already risen to a 13-year high, though there’s some reason to believe that’s a temporary effect of pandemic-driven shortages and reopening demand.      But the Biden budget is ultimately looking well beyond COVID-19 to try to address deeper economic problems that the administration argues are holding the U.S. back.      Here again circumstances give Biden a major advantage when it comes to selling his proposal to the public. Though the U.S. response to the pandemic got off to a rocky start, the ultimate success of relief and vaccination programs seems to have actually increased Americans’ faith in government and their belief that government can play a positive role in their lives. According to a Johns Hopkins survey from October of last year, the share of U.S. adults who support an “active government role in society” rose from 24% to 34%.      The Biden proposal is an attempt to leverage that higher faith in government towards longer-term goals than pandemic relief. In many cases, the measures are responses to problems that have been allowed to fester for decades under the tax cuts and austerity that Ronald Reagan made the lodestar of U.S. policy. Disinvestment in public utilities, roads, bridges and dams has left them increasingly at risk of catastrophic failure, with massive economic costs. The failure of the Texas power grid in February, for example, could incur costs as high as $195 billion, as well as causing a number of deaths. That’s far more than it would have cost to prevent the failure, which was caused by inadequate winterizing of power plants before a major, predicted, drop in temperature in the region.      The best example may be education, where declining funding for public universities has played a major role in increasing student debt loads. Biden’s proposal to spend more to support community colleges would help address that in the long term, and his budget may include more direct student debt relief. But what might be most significant is that 90% of Democrats and 68% of Republicans support government action to ease student debt burdens.      Student debt relief is popular because it would make life easier for many individuals right now. But the deeper argument for spending more on education is, again, that it would increase long-term growth. The focus on community colleges is a great illustration of how this might work, since those schools often teach trades like welding and machining that have seen major worker shortages.      Those shortages not only increase expenses for businesses by driving wages up, but also hamper innovation and have other broad harmful effects. Lack of skilled machinists in the U.S., for instance, was a major hurdle to scaling up domestic PPE manufacturing in response to the pandemic. Longer term, America’s “skills gap” is also making it more difficult to bring manufacturing operations back to American shores, another major Biden policy priority.      So that’s the theory, spending more now to improve the economy down the road. Even something like Biden’s child-care subsidy, which might be tempting to view as a mere handout, could be supported on economic grounds. The pandemic pushed millions of women, including many high earners and innovators crucial to the success of the broader economy, to stay home. Child care could help them get back to work.      But what about that huge bill? The least outlandish defense is simply that with wise investment now, real economic growth will make it easier to pay off debts down the road. But the Biden proposal’s enshrinement of permanent deficits as a normal and uncontroversial part of the U.S. budget is much harder to rationalize, even from the most progressive perspective. The pandemic has convinced many Americans for the first time that the government has a legitimate and positive role to play in their lives, but the bill for all that help does eventually come due.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION,David Z.

According to the SEC's complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, from about January 2017 to January 2018, Bitconnect used a network of promoters to offer and sell over $2 billion in securities without registering the offering with the SEC, and without being registered as broker-dealers as required by the federal securities law.      ""We allege that these defendants unlawfully sold unregistered digital asset securities by actively promoting the Bitconnect lending program to retail investors,"" said Lara Shalov Mehraban, associate regional director of SEC's New York office. ""We will seek to hold accountable those who illegally profit by capitalizing on the public's interest in digital assets.""      Bitconnect collapsed in 2018 after state regulators in Texas and North Carolina filed cease-and-desist letters against its lending and exchange platform.      The SEC's complaint charges promoters including U.S.-based Trevon Brown (aka Trevon James), Craig Grant, Ryan Maasen and Michael Noble (aka Michael Crypto) with violating the registration provisions of federal securities laws. The complaint also charges U.S.-based Joshua Jeppesen with aiding and abetting Bitconnect's offer and sale of securities.      The promoters touted the benefits of investing in Bitconnect's lending program to prospective investors, including the use of testimonial style videos and publishing them on YouTube, the SEC said in its release. According to the complaint, the promoters received commissions based on their success in soliciting funds.      The complaint seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement plus interest and civil penalties.      After the complaint was made public, Brown tweeted ""I just became a villain again.""      While no criminal complaints were filed, the FBI has been investigating Bitconnect for the last three years. Brown said in March 2018 that he had spoken with FBI agents, and the federal investigator posted a notice in 2019 asking for investors to reach out.      A representative of the criminal division at the Department of Justice's Southern District of New York office said no criminal charges were anticipated today.      Promotors of the project have been arrested in other countries as well: Indian police arrested promotor Divyesh Darji in 2018, while Australian authorities filed charges against John Bigatton last year.

The budget published Friday, the first from the Biden administration, includes two proposals that would give the Treasury Department additional requirements around what type of information financial institutions must report to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) or other Treasury sub-departments.      The first proposal, mentioned in the White House budget itself, would ""expand broker information reporting with respect to cryptocurrency assets.""      A Treasury Department ""Green Book"" provided more context, saying the proposed change would ""expand the scope of information reporting by brokers"" by allowing them to share information across different jurisdictions that have partnered with the U.S.      The document states:    ""The proposal would require brokers, including entities such as U.S. crypto asset exchanges and hosted wallet providers, to report information relating to certain passive entities and their substantial foreign owners when reporting with respect to crypto assets held by those entities in an account with the broker.""    Gross proceeds, sales and ""substantial foreign owners"" in passive entities would be included in these reports.      The proposal would take effect for returns filed after Dec. 31, 2022, according to the document.      ""Tax evasion using crypto assets is a rapidly growing problem. Since the industry is entirely digital, taxpayers can transact with offshore crypto exchanges and wallet providers without leaving the United States,"" the Treasury Department document said as an explanation for the proposal.    Information reporting    The 2022 budget includes several other crypto reporting requirements, according to the Treasury document.      The second proposal to introduce a ""comprehensive financial account reporting"" structure for tax compliance purposes, would require financial institutions to report data on user accounts with a breakdown on different types of transfers above a de minimis threshold of $600.      This would include crypto asset exchanges and custodians, the document said.      ""Separately, reporting requirements would apply in cases in which taxpayers buy crypto assets from one broker and then transfer the crypto assets to another broker, and businesses that receive crypto assets in transactions with a fair market value of more than $10,000 would have to report such transactions,"" the proposal said.

42406470,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeufMr,1622227375,Money Reimagined: Crypto Winter Again? Time to Regroup,"Bitcoin got its Consensus bump. But is it enough?      Not only did CoinDesk’s blockbuster Consensus 2021 conference deliver big news and insights this week, it also gave the bitcoin market what it hoped for: a repeat of the price rally that typically occurs during this important annual event. (See this newsletter’s “Off the Charts” section.)      That bump may have been helped by Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio declaring that he prefers bitcoin over bonds and by a host of other sector-friendly developments during Consensus. But let’s be clear: the 9% gain for bitcoin makes but a tiny dent in the market’s prior losses. We are still down 44% from the all time high of $64,829.      So, contrary to the upbeat mood of our own conference, this Debbie Downer is here to tell you we may face a long haul before returning to the highs of this year. This week’s column is about crypto entering another consolidation phase, during which the community will need to engage in a more constructive debate about blockchain tech’s impact on the planet.      Of course, energy and bitcoin were far from the only topics discussed in the “big tent” experience that is Consensus, with a speaker list numbering more than 300. Another matter was the outlook for central bank digital currencies, which became the focus of a special edition of our “Money Reimagined” podcast, this one recorded inside the conference. For that, Sheila Warren and I talked to Christian Catalini, chief economist of the Diem project (formerly Libra), and Benedicte Nolens, who heads up the Bank of International Settlements’ innovation hub in Hong Kong.      Have a listen after reading the column.    Crypto Winter Again? Time to Regroup    I didn’t want to write these words:      I think we’re entering Crypto Winter II.      It’s not about the price decline per se. It’s that, after a period when the outside world – the “mainstream” – seemed finally to get crypto, those outsiders are now having second thoughts, as they did during the Crypto Winter of 2018. Crypto people might not like to admit it, but they crave acceptance – more so, perhaps, than adoption. They want to be understood.      This time, the rejection flows from a rising narrative, one that’s proving extremely difficult for the community to contain, about the supposedly negative environmental impact of crypto generally and bitcoin specifically.    It’s bigger than Musk    The price-destroying impact of Elon Musk’s negative turn on bitcoin two weeks ago had nothing to do with the immaterial monetary impact of Tesla no longer accepting bitcoin payments. It reflected the realization that even Musk, once a crypto-booster, felt compelled by forces bigger than his giant ego to fall in line with the bitcoin-is-bad-for-the-planet narrative.    You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    Large financial institutions are rapidly becoming sustainability-conscious, with investment committees that demand compliance with ESG objectives. That means anyone in need of capital, including Tesla, has to signal that they are, too.      Given that bitcoin’s price rallies this year were fueled by Wall Street institutions buying it as a hedge against fiat monetary expansion, the idea that those same institutions are now more reluctant to do so on ESG grounds will weigh on the bitcoin price, possibly for some time.      That shift from mainstream support to mainstream disapproval offers an echo of Crypto Winter I, when the collapse of the initial coin offering bubble left newby retail investors burned and disillusioned with that era’s crypto promise of fast token riches. On the other hand, the runup before this collapse seemed more legitimate than that one, as the entrance of institutional investors was founded on a solid assessment of bitcoin’s value proposition in the context of a challenging macroeconomic outlook.      But even if the circumstances are different, the first Crypto Winter offers lessons in how a quieter period in markets might, ironically, enable the development of the technology. As with that previous lull period, developers of crypto projects are now presented with an opportunity to focus on “building” – or BUIDLing, as the meme went back then.      A ton of important development occurred in 2018-2019, fostering projects that are now integral to the crypto ecosystem. It’s when the most serious advances were made in non-fungible token (NFT) trailblazer project CryptoKitties, in MakerDAO’s dai token – which spawned the decentralized finance (DeFi) revolution – and in the Lightning network and other layer 2 technologies now helping solve scaling problems.      Similar engineering work is now needed – to reduce transaction costs, to improve privacy while addressing identity challenges, and to continue to scale while optimizing decentralization. But we also need a different kind of development: that of relationships, with governments, with large companies and with the public at large.      If we are going to get ahead of the debate around sustainability, the crypto community needs to engage with these stakeholders. It needs to BUIDL relationships and foster a narrative of shared interest in place of the us-versus-them divisions that are the community’s own worst enemy.    Strategic engagement    When faced with sometimes simplistic criticisms that bitcoin “wastes more energy than Sweden consumes,” crypto supporters often engage in whataboutism (“but how much energy does the petro-dollar financial system consume?”) or ask philosophical questions about what constitutes “waste.” And, yes, if they can convince everyone that bitcoin will solve all their problems in the fiat financial system cannot, they’ll also convince them that all this energy consumption is worth it.      But it should be clear by now, after years of engaging in these debates, the argument won’t be won with “I’m smarter than you” responses. In fact, it probably turns public opinion more negative because it leaves the impression that the bitcoin community believes its carbon footprint is something to ignore.      Dismissing bitcoin’s greenhouse emissions is naive and, frankly, untenable. The reality is that subsidies for fossil fuels worldwide continue to make them a profitable option for miners, which means that, as bitcoin’s hashrate increases, it will continue, for now, to grow its carbon footprint.      Per my column last week, there’s an opportunity to bring a variety of stakeholders to the table to move bitcoin mining from being a net polluter to becoming a force multiplier for renewable energy that underwrites the development of green, decentralized electricity infrastructure.      That’s the kind of BUIDLing we need. Bitcoin miners and others in the crypto community must work with other actors with an interest in green energy solutions to devise collaborative plans that meet both sides’ needs.      Go out and talk to city grid operators about variable mining contracts to help manage the “duck curve” problem caused by unused solar capacity. Partner with investors and companies with a direct interest in expanding decentralized electricity grids to deploy mining operations as a funding mechanism for solar, wind and mini-hydro solutions around the world. Sit down with national energy policy makers and strike deals on supportive tax, subsidy and community reinvestment incentives to align miners’ interests with sustainability and energy needs.      I, for one, think the new Bitcoin Mining Council, formed by a group of North American bitcoin mining firms with the support of Musk and MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor, is a fine idea – unlike a few bitcoiners, who worry about it being a centralized “cabal.” This is precisely the kind of coordinated actions among deep-pocketed stakeholders with common interests that’s needed to not only move the conversation forward.      At the top of some special ESG-themed programming for “Money Reimagined” on CoinDesk TV Monday and Tuesday, my podcast co-host, Sheila Warren of the World Economic Forum, floated a separate multi-stakeholder initiative: an umbrella organization housed at the WEF to create a framework for environmental, social and governance-focused innovation in blockchain and crypto technologies. The Crypto Impact and Sustainability Accelerator, which CoinDesk is supporting as a media partner, will bring together interested entities from finance, accounting, industry, tech, government and NGOs to find consensus around a framework with which the otherwise unfettered process of blockchain development should ideally seek to comply. The point is to ensure the open-source tech projects are interoperable and align with overarching planetary goals such as the Paris Climate Accord.      Without this kind of high-level coordination among a cross-section of invested global stakeholders, there can be no common design parameters for ESG-targeting crypto technology. While it’s important to allow innovation to freely emerge on its own, we cannot solve the world’s problems within the current, chaotic mix of contradictory metrics and tech standards that make it impossible to collectively determine whether we’re actually saving the planet or not. Without common standards, markets in ESG digital assets cannot emerge, for example. This WEF initiative may be one of those rare occasions when a high-level talk group is actually necessary.      The bigger point is that the collective needs of society will not be fixed by the crypto community on its own. It must start forming real-world alliances. It needs a seat at the table with those who control the capital and who set the policies that will solve those problems.      Right now, Crypto Winter or not, is the time to do it.    Off the charts: The Consensus bump through history    As mentioned at the opening, it does appear that Consensus 2021 saw a repeat of the “Consensus Bump” phenomenon. The bitcoin price rose with the launch of the conference and more or less held its gains into the end of the conference.      How real is this effect, though? It might depend on what you use as your benchmark. Some people refer to the bump being a runup in prices in the days and weeks preceding the conference, others refer to the price performance during Consensus week itself.      We figure we’ll stick with the latter and see how it has compared over seven years of Consensus conferences, from the one-day affair on Sept. 10 of 2015 and the three-day event of 2016 to the now four-day conferences that we’ve seen ever since 2017. The charts below capture each of those seven events, with the red line signifying the date on which the conference began.      I gotta say, I think there might be a little more myth and wishful thinking in this than reality. Sure, from 2017, there have been one-day “bumps” of varying size at the very start of the event. But it didn’t always last throughout the week.    The Conversation: A mining cabal?    One of the big stories of the week that did not emerge directly from Consensus came when a group of North American bitcoin mining companies met with Elon Musk and Michael Saylor to form a council committed to transparency around how much of the sources of energy they use. It started out innocent enough – as a feel-good alternative to the negative press for bitcoin generated a week earlier by Musk’s dunking on the cryptocurrency’s environmental harm. Saylor and Musk did the honors on Twitter in a tweet/retweet routine:      This was welcomed by some people, signaling Musk’s return to a pro-bitcoin stance and a positive effort to make bitcoin greener.      Others had a different take: This was a dangerous cabal, a secret agreement to differentiate coins that would render some better than others and destroy bitcoin fungibility.      But, really, all this was an agreement among these miners to keep publicly reporting the stuff they are already reporting. They’re providing transparency. And that’s a bad thing?      As Nic Carter alluded to, some of this just reflects how easy it is to push certain narratives in a bitcoin community willing to hear them.    Relevant reads: Consensus highlights    Some of the highlights of this year’s spectacularly successful conference.    I had the great privilege of interviewing a man I’ve long wanted to talk to: Ray Dalio. And the Bridgewater Associates founder didn’t disappoint. The headline that caught everyone’s attention was Dalio’s statement that he owns bitcoin. But what resonated for me was his big-picture take on the 75-year debt cycle that’s now coming to an end and pointing to an age of uncertainty.  CoinDesk’s Adam B. Levin’s debuted his new “NFT All-Stars” podcast with spectacular results: a stunning, inventive new piece of living digital art from trance music legend BT.  Jose Fernandez da Ponte, the head of PayPal’s blockchain operation, dropped a bit of crowd-pleasing news, telling a Consensus panel that, as well as allowing users to buy and sell crypto, it will now allow users to withdraw that crypto to their own wallets.

42406463,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeufEz,1622224884,DeFi's Set Labs Raises $14M to Expand Crypto's Tokenized 'ETFs',"Set Labs, an upstart platform for creating structured decentralized finance (DeFi) investment products on Ethereum, has raised $14 million.      Early-stage token fund 1kx and crypto venture capital firm Hashed led the round, Set CEO Felix Feng told CoinDesk. He said the Series A will help Set decentralize its protocol and grow its lineup from four to as many as 20 multicoin investment vehicles.      Think of them as crypto-native exchange-traded funds (ETFs).      Nailing the decentralization aspect could prove critical for a startup that, in Feng’s telling, has seen its protocol’s tokenized portfolios, “which are kind of like ETFs,” balloon to $400 million in value.      “The more customers you have, the more decentralized you need to be,” Feng said of a regulatory “rule of thumb” in the experimental realm of DeFi. He estimated current users around 20,000.      Set’s plans speak to a key tension in DeFi, where projects seek to emulate traditional financial services like borrowing, lending and trading, but without all the baggage perceived to come through centralized control and beyond the reach of traditional oversight.      “What we aim to be is the BlackRock of crypto,” Feng said, name-dropping the world’s largest asset manager.    Set’s next step    To get there, Set has homed in on portfolio development. Its protocol allows users to gain exposure to many coins, usually bundled thematically, by purchasing a single token. There’s the UNI-heavy DeFi Pulse Index, the Metaverse Index long on tokens from virtual worlds and a pair of leveraged products.      Everything is non-custodial, Feng said, with investors’ cash pooled into one single contract.      “You can own a token, like an ETF token, that represents your stake, your share of what is in that smart contract,” Feng said, noting users can make trades, yield farm and stake within the strategy.      He intends to see more strategies listed by the end of the year.    DPI    The DeFi Pulse Index (DPI), which had a market cap around $140 million at press time, is Set’s oldest and most popular portfolio, Feng said. Set’s portfolios have spiked from $30 to $50 million in total value locked (TVL) during 2020’s DeFi summer to $400 million today.      That’s chump change when stacked against BlackRock’s $8.6 trillion under management. But crypto still pales against traditional financial markets.      Read more: New Index From DeFi Pulse and Set Protocol Offers Easy Access to 10 DeFi Tokens in 1      Regardless, Feng is focused on growing Set Labs by staying true to its decentralized roots. He wants to build out the communities behind its two baby projects: asset management rail Set Protocol, and Index Coop, the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) building the ETF-esque portfolios.      Community members will gradually assume more control of the DAO through governance token distributions, Feng said. Questions over product parameters and fund allocation decisions will be put to token-weighted vote.      He said this pursuit of sufficient decentralization helps ensure the project stays in the clear with regulators.

42406471,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeufLs,1622223837,"What $DESK Says About Scarcity, Value and Money","It was always a blow to discover the latest $DESK drop was “depleted,” or that others had gotten to it first, after spending about a minute validating my email with Torus and waiting for the tokens to materialize (or not) in my Unifty wallet. I wanted the tokens, but I wasn’t quite sure why. But when they didn’t come, it made me feel more like a “piranha” than a $DESK whale.      Over the four-day Consensus event, CoinDesk ran an experiment in an attempt to bridge the gap between its Web 2.0 media presence and the decentralized, crypto-powered future vision of the web we write about so much. It was a community-building effort, a way for attendees to learn about tokens, experience the redemption process and interact with a fully virtual event. By most accounts, it was successful.    This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    “I think it's interesting how quickly it creates a tribal community of people who've never met each other before, all rallying around accumulating more coin,” John Thiel, adviser at Private Ocean Wealth Management, said.  More than 1,300 wallet addresses were spun up, approximately 22,000 $DESK claims were made and potentially billions of tokens were issued. Conference attendants exchanged these tokens – which have no direct monetary value, as they exist only on an Ethereum testnet – for crypto-themed non-fungible tokens and experiences, like lunch with Justin Sun.  More than that, a genuine $DESK community emerged. Within the chat rooms alongside the panel discussions, people spoke and joked about $DESK. Every panel subject could be redirected to be about $DESK: $DESK staking, $DESK atomic swaps, $DESK layer 2s.  An unofficial Discord channel emerged, where people could share strategies on how to acquire the most tokens (like pointing users to the latest airdrop), as well as a more-official, 366-member (and growing) Telegram channel that creators are still figuring out what to do with.  For years, cryptocurrency enthusiasts have theorized that tokenomics and the “participation economy” could solve some of the pressing issues in the media today. The current internet stack means publishers and readers are beholden to third-party ad sellers and data brokers.  “An open-source, internet-native monetary layer is the makeweight that could tilt value back in favor of writers, broadcasters and other creators, as well as the communities that support them,” Joon Ian Wong, a CoinDesk alum turned independent token adviser and founding co-president of the Association of Cryptocurrency Journalists and Researchers, wrote in a recent op-ed.  Wong thought $DESK, as far as these things go, was “hugely successful” and “exactly what you would want with a pop-up community money.” It showed how even valueless tokens can form bonds between people, “which is what money is supposed to do,” he said over DM.    Read more: Money Reimagined: Memes Mean Money    “I've been in crypto for a long time (2011? 2012?) and this community is an important part of my life. Digital badges allow a sense of pride and social engagement within the community,” John Berger, another Consensus attendee, said.  Berger said on the last day of the conference he woke up at 4:30 a.m. local time and planned to stay throughout the event’s close, partially in a bid to collect as much $DESK as possible.    Microcosm    In some sense, $DESK is a microcosm of the cryptocurrency industry at large. It is an expression of how novel technologies, simply by coming into being and offering something new, can gain ground.  Although people weren’t immediately able to trade in bitcoin for branded sweatshirts or NFT representations of crypto micro-celebrities (like CoinDesk CEO Kevin Worth), the idea of a digital asset that can be wholly owned was grasped by a few early adopters.  $DESK, BTC and NFTs have value because they are scarce assets that exist within the context of an ever-widening internet, where ideas and images can be reproduced endlessly, and an ever-expanding monetary regime. (To be sure, $DESK’s scarcity is arbitrary, at the whim of how many drops ""the central bank of CoinDesk"" decides to issue and the natural demand for the tokens.)  “I think bitcoin was destined to become an asset,” Jenna Pilgrim, one of the contractors who designed $DESK, said. “I don't think $DESK is destined to become an asset because it does have a centralized supply. Like, we own the means of production.”  Perceived scarcity (in terms of the number of drops and how quickly they’re depleted) is one part of the equation, but so is gamification. Pilgrim said the drops were engineered to be random, “to help reward those that were paying attention.”  Both Thiel and Berger admitted half the fun was just accumulating their bags. They just liked watching their balances go up – perhaps a familiar feeling for anyone with a bank account.  These elements of gamification and scarcity are present in any free market society.  Although Pilgrim and other CoinDesk staffers designed strict “guardrails” around the beta $DESK economy, like in any free market, certain players found ways to game the system. By the second day of Consensus, people figured out how to “resell” items on Unifty. A pizza NFT redeemed for 10,000 $DESK was re-uploaded onto the centralized marketplace for 30,000 $DESK. The same thing happened with a T-shirt.  “Everything is well and good until, you know, people start a Uniswap secondary market for $DESK that is now priced at whatever,” Pilgrim said. It doesn’t seem like that has happened, though Pilgrim mentioned the “anxiety” of being a community manager and having to decide when to step in.    Read more: State of Crypto: Unpacking Hester Peirce’s Newest Safe Harbor Proposal    No one is exchanging money for $DESK, so it’s likely not a security, she said. So, for the most part, the experiment in open markets was allowed to run.  On the Discord, there were discussions – so far mostly in jest – to port $DESK over from its testnet and build DESKswap, a version of the decentralized exchanges Uniswap and SushiSwap.  So what’s next for this experiment? Pilgrim said it would make sense to move into a live environment, in case Rinkeby ever goes down, but beyond that: “the honest answer is, I don't know.”      CORRECTION (MAY 29 12:50 UTC): Corrects Joon Ian Wong's surname.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | UNI | AIRDROP,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/28/what-desk-says-about-scarcity-value-and-money,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9b0c197995f0cc55a58be4db236061f802dceb0a-1654x910.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

""The bottom line is that it seems to be highly speculative.""      Many private lenders, including ICICI Bank, the second-largest, have stopped serving local crypto exchanges. According to some reports, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been encouraging banks to reduce ties to the exchanges.      The Economic Times reported Friday that the exchanges are planning to ask the Supreme Court for a directive on whether the central bank can ask private lenders to shut down payment gateways to merchants associated with cryptocurrency trading.      The court set aside the RBI's two-year-long banking ban on crypto exchanges in March 2020. The government has yet to clarify regulations, meaning that cryptocurrency trading is still legal in India.      According to HDFC Bank, the regulatory uncertainty will subside, bringing more investments into cryptocurrencies. While interest in the topic is often driven by ""transient bouts of intense interest,"" cryptocurrencies are likely to remain available, and bitcoin has properties of being a good hedge from the perspective of portfolio diversification, it said.

The investment firm said the VanEck Vectors Bitcoin exchange-traded note (ETN) and VanEck Vectors Ethereum ETN will both be listed on the two exchanges in Europe on Tuesday with a total expense ratio of 1%.  The ETNs will give investors exposure to the price of bitcoin and ethereum without investors having to buy the crypto themselves. Both ETNs are fully collateralized and each ETN share represents the share of bitcoin or ethereum.  VanEck will rely on Bank Frick as the custodian which is regulated in the European Economic Area country of Liechtenstein, where the cryptocurrencies held by the ETNs will be kept in cold storage to guarantee their security.  An ETN is a type of unsecured debt security payable to the bearer that tracks an underlying asset or an index. In effect, investors gain exposure to an asset class without owning it.  “Bitcoin and ethereum have firmly established themselves on the market as the two largest cryptocurrencies. Due to their low correlations to other asset classes, they provide an interesting opportunity to diversify one’s investment portfolio,"" says Martijn Rozemuller, CEO at VanEck Europe.  Currently, a VanEck crypto ETN already trades on the Deutsche Börse Xetra market in Germany.  In May, the investment firm launched a thematic exchange-traded fund (ETF) in Europe, the “VanEck Vectors Digital Assets Equity UCITS ETF,” offering exposure to companies in cryptocurrency and blockchain.  Meanwhile, VanEck’s application to launch a bitcoin ETF in the U.S. is being considered by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

42406465,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeufGx,1622201328,Bitcoin Remains in Corrective Phase Below $40K; Further Downside Expected,"Bitcoin (BTC) failed to sustain moves above $40,000 resistance on Thursday as the broader uptrend weakens. The cryptocurrency was trading around $36,000 at the time of writing and upside appears limited into the weekend.      A bearish trend reversal is on watch after months of slowing momentum, consolidation and a downside break below $50,000 and $40,000. Bitcoin is down about 37% month to date and has experienced a series of sharp drawdowns similar to 2017 which preceded a bear market.    The relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart has been oversold over the past week as price held support around $30,000. However, the RSI is not yet oversold on the weekly chart which suggests price upside should remain limited around $40,000.  Bitcoin is below the 100-day and 200-day moving averages. This indicates the corrective phase that began earlier this month remains in effect.  On intraday charts, bitcoin failed to hold support. Further downside towards $33,000 could encourage short-term buyers and stabilize the current decline.    Despite signs of a broader trend reversal, there are still short-term opportunities for active traders. “BTC can be very volatile, especially compared to assets in traditional markets,” wrote Justin Chuh, senior trader at Wave Financial, in an email to CoinDesk.      “No one is borrowing to short spot BTC, we sill have an upward sloping forward curve, and downside protection remains relatively light,” said Chuh, who added that support will need to hold above $30,000, or otherwise bitcoin would be down on the year.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | TRADING,Damanick Dantes,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/28/bitcoin-remains-in-corrective-phase-below-40k-further-downside-expected,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ff8b829084da1138e4804ea02edf98e5da457d90-1810x1084.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The e-krona is set to move from the simulation phase to a testing environment with external participants, Reuters reported Friday.

The Riksbank announced in April that it would involve commercial banks in the next phase of the project, which could reach fruition within five years, according to Governor Stefan Ingves.  “The project means the opportunity to participate in what may be among the first digital central bank-issued money in the world to be available to the public,” Handelsbanken said in a statement.  Sweden appears to be second only to China among major economies in the advancement of its CBDC plans, Reuters said.

42406472,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeufKt,1622197465,Fed Research Finds Private Digital Currencies Can Be 'Attractive Cash Alternative' for Firms,"Under certain conditions, issuing a digital currency can be an attractive alternative to cash for companies, according to the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond in Virginia.      In an economic brief published Thursday, the Richmond Fed said the decision to develop and launch a platform digital currency comes down to several key factors.      According to the brief, the expense of creating a digital currency is notable, and an issuing company must also ensure its system is secure from cyberattacks. There are also risks for users, such as bankruptcy of the issuer.      When inflation is low and stable, the costs of issuance mean it is optimal for a company to use existing payment systems.      On the other hand, ""when inflation is high enough that consumers prefer to minimize cash holdings, the cost of establishing and securing a new digital currency system is low, and the platform's market share is sufficiently large, then it is optimal for the platform to issue its own currency,"" the brief states.      The brief is based on a working paper by two of its authors, Jonathan Chiu, senior research advisor at the Bank of Canada, and Russell Wong, senior economist, research division, at the Richmond Fed.      As an example from the paper cited in the brief, for Amazon to turn a profit from issuing and accepting only its own digital currency, interest rates would need to be above 11%, or the retail giant would need a much larger market share. The authors' model also suggests that high regulatory costs in the U.S. would dissuade platforms from such an issuance.      For companies, the authors say that a key benefit is seigniorage revenue – the profit from selling the digital currency.      ""Historically, this revenue has been reserved for sovereign nations, which have long held a monopoly on money creation,"" the brief says. It also cites loyalty benefits, data harvesting and lower settlement risk as reasons for companies to issue their own tokens.    See also: Binance.US CEO Brian Brooks: Excluding Crypto Banks From Fed System Is ‘Dangerous’    Still, the authors say traditional payment methods are generally more secure, and the costs are likely to be lower than developing a digital currency. Rather than seigniorage, firms can still charge fees on payments made through the platform, they say.      Examining whether regulators should be worried about private digital currencies, the authors point out that company decisions are based on profit, not benefits for society, and their digital currencies could circulate outside the platform to compete with sovereign currencies.      ""This can also reduce the seigniorage the central bank earns from issuing cash,"" according to the brief. ""If widely adopted, platform digital currency can also subject the financial system to cybersecurity risks and bank runs.""      The working paper further looked at whether financial regulations like deposit insurance and reserve requirements can ""optimize"" firms' decisions on issuing a digital currency. The conclusion was, such rules are ""not very helpful.""

42406466,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeufFy,1622196592,"Bitcoin Drops, Stocks Rally Ahead of Biden's Budget Announcement","Bitcoin is nursing losses on Friday despite hopes of more inflation-boosting U.S. stimulus to come.      On Friday, President Joe Biden is set to release his first full budget, seeking $6 trillion in federal spending for the fiscal year 2022 and $8.2 trillion by 2021, The New York Times reports.      The proposal shows the Biden administration remains undeterred by recent inflation fears and is unlikely to close the liquidity tap anytime soon, having already pumped trillions of dollars into the system to counter the economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic since March 2020.      That's potentially a bullish development for bitcoin, which is widely touted as digital gold. However, the leading cryptocurrency is changing hands near $35,800 at press time, representing a 7% drop on the day. The decline comes a day after buyers failed to establish a foothold above the $40,000 mark.      However, the prospect of more liquidity is pushing stocks higher. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index is trading 0.43% higher at new record highs above 445 points, according to Investing.com. Futures tied to the S&P 500 are also hinting at a positive start to trading on Friday with a 0.5% gain.      Bitcoin's adverse reaction to talk of more stimulus appears confounding, given it rallied from $5,000 to over $60,000 in the past 12 months, alongside a steady rise in the U.S. 10-year breakeven rate, the bond market's forecast of long-term price pressures.      The cryptocurrency has received validation as an inflation hedge from Wall Street bigwigs and several listed companies. “Personally, I’d rather have bitcoin than a bond,” in an inflationary scenario, Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio said during an hour-long conversation with CoinDesk Chief Content Officer Michael J. Casey earlier this week during Consensus 2021.      Increasing concerns about the environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining and China's recent regulatory announcements could be keeping buyers at bay.      ""Retail appears to be slowing down while regulatory concerns and ESG FUD [fear, uncertainty and doubt] from China has taken center stage,"" Matthew Dibb, co-founder, and COO of Stack Funds, said. ""Many market participants are covering positions in light of anticipated news that (might) come to light."" ESG stands for ""environmental, social and corporate governance,"" a term used to refer to companies' sustainability and impact on society.      Bitcoin fell sharply from $58,000 to nearly $30,000 earlier this month after Tesla suspended vehicle purchases with bitcoin, citing environmental concerns.      ""Environmental concerns will get bigger with time. This will represent a major long-term headwind for bitcoin, and help push dominance down,"" trader and analyst Alex Kruger tweeted.      Also read: Ark’s Cathie Wood Blames Crypto Crash on ‘ESG Movement’      Additionally, fears that the Federal Reserve may raise the interest rate to counter inflation could be keeping the cryptocurrency under pressure. That's because rate hikes dilute the appeal of the store-of-value assets like bitcoin.      According to Bloomberg, rates traders have boosted bets that the Fed will raise borrowing costs next year, much earlier than policymakers have indicated.      ""The Fed's broad support of the economy since the onset of the pandemic has provided support for higher asset prices including stocks and cryptocurrencies,"" Ariel Zetlin-Jones, associate professor of economics at Carnegie Mellon University's Tepper School of Business, told CoinDesk in an email earlier this month. ""Ultimately, the removal of this support is likely to provide new headwinds for asset price growth.""      The rate hike fears may amplify, if the core personal consumption expenditure (core PCE) – the Fed's preferred measure of inflation – blows past expectations. That could lead to a deeper drop in bitcoin. The April data is scheduled for release at 12:30 UTC (8:30 a.m. ET) today.      However, analysts expect the cryptocurrency to see range play in the short term. ""From a technical point of view, BTC is in a consolidation phase.

Robinhood, which offers cryptocurrency trading among other investments, was attempting to block state regulators from moving forward with an enforcement action alleging the platform encourages inexperienced users to make risky trades without safeguarding limits.  Suffolk County Superior Court Judge Kenneth Salinger ruled that Robinhood can continue to challenge the allegation but could not block Secretary of State Bill Galvin from proceeding, Reuters reported Thursday.  “If the court were to strike down the challenged regulation, the division would still be entitled to press its separate claims that Robinhood’s alleged conduct was nonetheless unethical or dishonest,” Reuters quoted Salinger as writing.  Galvin announced the case in December 2020, prompting Robinhood to sue in April. The company argued that the action contravened federal law because such a standard was rejected by the Securities and Exchange Commission when it adopted its own rule for brokerages in 2019.

BurgerSwap is the latest DeFi protocol on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) to experience an attack of this nature.  The attackers created their own ""Fake Coin"" and formed a trading pair with the protocol's native token BURGER, ultimately changing the latter's price, BurgerSwap said in a series of tweets.  The exploit led to the theft of some $7.2 million in altcoins, including $3.2 million in BURGER, $1.6 million in wrapped binance coin (WBNB) and $1.4 million in tether.  BURGER is currently trading at $6.75, a drop of 27% from its 24-hour high of $9.24, according to CoinMarketCap data.  Recent exploits of DeFi projects built on BSC include an attack for $11 million on auto yield farming protocol bEarn Fi and one on yield-farming aggregator PancakeBunny that may have been worth as much as $3 million.

As reported by news.com.au on Friday, the ATO’s assistant commissioner, Tim Loh, said his office was ""alarmed"" certain taxpayers thought the anonymity of cryptocurrencies meant they could ignore tax obligations.      The ATO, the governmental agency that oversees the country's federal tax collection, will inform around 100,000 taxpayers holding cryptocurrency to review their previously lodged returns and ensure their declarations are correct. The tax department will also be asking around 300,000 people filing their 2021 tax returns to report their cryptocurrency capital gains or losses, according to the report.      “While it appears cryptocurrency operates in an anonymous digital world, we closely track where it interacts with the real world through data from banks, financial institutions and cryptocurrency online exchanges to follow the money back to the taxpayer,” Loh said.      See also: Nashville Couple Sues IRS Over Tezos Staking Rewards Tax      Under Australian federal law, cryptocurrencies are taxed as a form of property and are subject to the same regulations relating to capital gains. Non-fungible tokens, which have risen in popularity this year, are also considered taxable events under capital gains when disposed of.      “[We] follow the money trail back to the taxpayer and we do that through the ATO which has data matching profiles with cryptocurrency exchanges,"" Loh said. ""They provide that information to us and we use that information to cross match with people’s tax returns.”      Notifications from the ATO to potential culprits looking to obfuscate or shirk their duty to pay taxes on crypto is a familiar battleground for the department.      See also: Gov. Jared Polis Wants Colorado to Accept Crypto for State Taxes      Last year, the ATO issued a similar warning to hundreds of thousands of residents, claiming it has the ability to deploy its Data Matching Protocol for cryptocurrencies. This allows the taxman to cross-check data on individuals with data provided by cryptocurrency exchanges.      “There isn’t a game of hide and seek,"" said Loh.

You’re reading a special Consensus 2021 edition of State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  CBDCs and innovation    CoinDesk’s annual conference usually features a host of policymakers and regulators explaining how they’re approaching crypto and how that approach has changed over the past few years. Here are some of this year’s highlights.      Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard: The U.S. central bank official opened Consensus with a breakdown of how exactly the Boston Fed is looking at a digital dollar from a policy perspective.      Wyoming Governor Mark Gordon: The governor of Wyoming revealed he owns cryptocurrencies, and said he’s concerned about government-issued digital currencies.      International Monetary Fund Division Chief Tommaso Mancini-Griffoli: The IMF division chief said that, hypothetically, a world with multiple reserve currencies would be fairly stable. He was responding to a question about China’s digital yuan.      U.S. Sen. Cynthia Lummis: The crypto-friendly lawmaker’s Financial Innovation Caucus officially launched on Tuesday, with Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) and Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) spearheading the effort.      SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce: The growth of digital assets might force the Securities and Exchange Commission to modernize its custody rules more quickly than it might otherwise, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce said.      Colorado Gov. Jared Polis: Jared Polis, previously a congressman who co-founded the Congressional Blockchain Caucus, said he wants to work with his state’s policymakers to help it accept crypto for taxes.      Christian Catalini: The diem co-creator and chief economist and MIT professor said the original Facebook-led vision for the libra stablecoin project was “naive.” C'est possible.      Bank of Mauritius Governor Harvesh Seegolam: Mauritius’ central bank plans to launch a central bank digital currency by the end of the year, Harvesh Seegolam said. He previously teased there'd be research into a CBDC at Consensus: Distributed last year.      National Security Council Director of Cybersecurity Carole House: White House adviser Carole House said a lack of controls may require the U.S. government to create some regulations to limit fundraising by malicious actors.      Acting FinCEN Director Michael Mosier: Michael Mosier, who took office earlier this year after former FinCEN Director Kenneth Blanco stepped down, said a controversial rule proposal that would require crypto exchanges to collect counterparty data for transactions to private wallets is still being evaluated.    Elsewhere:  Ray Dalio: ‘I Have Some Bitcoin’: Ray Dalio, the billionaire investor and hedge fund manager who founded Bridgewater Associates, revealed Monday he owns bitcoin.  Binance Says ‘Rollback’ Not Possible After DeFi Exploits on Binance Smart Chain: Binance can’t help roll back decentralized finance exploits on projects built on the Binance Smart Chain, business and ecosystem development coordinator Samy Karim said. BSC uses a proof-of-staked-authority consensus mechanism, meaning BNB token holders can vote for the stakers. Binance is one major token holder.

42386891,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBViAJ,1622163107,"Liquidity Mining Will Return to Uniswap 'Very Soon,' Founder Says","Uniswap, the leading automated market maker (AMM) on the Ethereum blockchain, should be running a liquidity mining program again in short order, its founder said.      ""I think it's going to be very soon,"" Hayden Adams said in a prerecorded interview broadcast Thursday to wrap up Consensus 2021. ""One thing that we've seen in the past couple of weeks is basically a grant from the Uniswap grants program, which comes from governance, that was ... issued to someone who's working on liquidity mining smart contracts. And so we're kind of seeing the community build this out.""      Liquidity mining is a kind of yield farming in which users of a decentralized finance (DeFi) product earn an additional token on top of the regularly expected yield just for putting assets into a liquidity pool – hence the term, ""liquidity mining.""      When the money market Compound announced a liquidity mining program for its governance token, COMP, last year, it kicked off the boomlet known as DeFi Summer 2020.      Toward the end of that heady period, Uniswap airdropped, or distributed, its governance token, UNI, to eligible stakeholders and then ran a very brief liquidity mining program across a few key liquidity pools.      Since then there has been no way for users to earn new UNI (except the Uniswap grants program).      However, at the launch of UNI, Uniswap reserved 430 million units for distribution in several different ways, including liquidity mining.      Laying the foundations for this moneymaker's return, Omar Bohsali, the entrepreneur-in-residence at Paradigm Capital, the fund founded by Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam, has been working on a staking system for the newest version of Uniswap's software.      Adams announced on Twitter on May 18 that Bohsali's work had earned the support of the grants program, which is run by six people approved through Uniswap's governance system.    Third time's the charm    Uniswap released the third version of its software this month, and it quickly became the most popular decentralized exchange on Ethereum.      Previous versions of automated market makers could be knocked out of line with the market by large trades and wasted liquidity. The new version allows sophisticated market makers to lock their deposits in within the band in which traders are likely to want to trade. This improves efficiency for traders.      ""There was sort of a lot of speculation, when we first announced v3, because it was much more complex and liquidity isn't all identical. There were some open-ended questions from people as well. Would it be possible? And the answer is yes. It's completely possible. And it's being built,"" Adams said at Consensus.      Uniswap gives any asset holder on Ethereum (the second-largest blockchain, based on the market cap of its native token, ETH) a way to participate in making markets, something that has only been possible for people with very deep pockets in traditional finance. Any two Ethereum tokens can be placed in a Uniswap pool, which improves liquidity for that trading pair. A liquidity pool serves as a sort of stockroom for a decentralized exchange, ensuring that when someone offers to buy or sell a token, the asset they want is available.      ""Uniswap is basically a protocol for trading digital currencies,"" Adams said. ""It makes useage of the decentralized nature of Ethereum in a new way.""      In the prior liquidity mining run, users who deposited funds in various Uniswap pools were rewarded with UNI tokens.    Governance    Approving the grants program is the only action Uniswap governance has taken since UNI was released. Only two prior measures have reached a final vote, and both failed, including a bid led by Dharma, a DeFi portal for mobile devices, to make retroactive airdrops to more past Uniswap users.      ""Definitely, I would say it is a conservative approach,"" Adams said of Uniswap governance. ""From day one, we were kind of committed to it being as decentralized as possible and have it sort of fully on-chain. And so it was like a little bit of a slower process with a higher threshold for things passing.""      Adams argued that with the grants program funding new projects, activity will speed up.      ""It's kind of it's slow and it'll be slow, and then it will be very fast as some of the infrastructure comes into place,"" Adams said.    DeFi to come    Ehrsam, a Uniswap investor and co-panelist with Adams at Consensus, predicted many more financial services will enter the space.      ""If there's a periodic table of all of the financial primitives that one needs in a financial system, what are all the elements on the table? Which exist today in DeFi and which do not yet exist? And I think what we're seeing is just the natural kind of progression of basic financial building blocks from simple to complicated,"" Ehrsam said.      He said he expects the number of financial services to proliferate potentially as fast as the kinds of media content proliferated with the invention of the internet.      Adams agreed.      ""Not only will it be kind of one by one, replacing all the TradFi [traditional finance] stuff, but I think that beyond that we might be discovering some new elements as well. Things that kind of simply weren't possible in traditional financial systems might be made possible in DeFi,"" he said. ""I think it applies to financial products, and probably also financial assets as well. I'm expecting [a] many, many orders of magnitude increase in just the number of assets that exist.""",POSITIVE,ETH | UNI,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | MINING | UNI,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/28/liquidity-mining-will-return-to-uniswap-very-soon-founder-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/68d093ac23de548db7aace23370cf50cad1d5ec5-1128x679.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42386893,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBVi7n,1622160000,NFL Legend Tom Brady Has 'Definitely' Invested in Crypto,"Tom Brady has “definitely” gotten involved in investing in the cryptocurrency market, the seven-time Super Bowl champion said Thursday.      “I'm a big believer in [crypto],” Brady said in a pre-recorded video interview with FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried. He did not share any specific details about which crypto assets he’s invested in.      The Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback only recently entered the public crypto sphere, launching non-fungible token (NFT) platform Autograph last month and changing his Twitter profile picture to the bitcoin laser eyes meme shortly after.      “In my understanding, it was really a vote of confidence to really get into the conversation as I'm such a big believer in crypto, and where things are heading in the world,” Brady said.      But Brady, who won six of his Super Bowl titles with the New England Patriots of the U.S. National Football League before signing with Tampa Bay, said he’s been discussing cryptocurrency for far longer than just the past month. And when asked whether he had “gotten involved with any investing in crypto,” Brady said, “I definitely have.”      “In our quarterback room, one of my coaches has been on it for eight, nine months. So we talk about it basically every day, the prices of the different tokens, how the space is doing,” Brady said.      He compared his embrace of the crypto space to his approach to health and wellness.      “I've been someone who decided to treat my body differently than the way that everyone else treated it,” said Brady, who also runs his own health business.    NFL players’ BTC embrace    However, Brady does not anticipate being paid in crypto the way his peers have sought. Free agent offensive tackle Russell Okung, free agent tight end Sean Culkin and free agent quarterback Matt Barkley have all sought to get their salaries in bitcoin.      While a member of the Carolina Panthers, Okung secured an arrangement where the Panthers would send half of his salary to crypto startup Zap, which would convert it to BTC.      Culkin later secured a similar deal while on the Kansas City Chiefs but was cut shortly thereafter. No National Football League player has been paid directly in crypto by his team to date.      “At the end of the day, technically that can’t happen, [teams] can’t pay their athletes [in bitcoin], what they pay is in dollars,” Brady said. “But I mean, how you invest your money? Absolutely. So I definitely think there'll be more solutions as this is more widely adopted in all areas of our lives.”    ‘Emerging markets’    For Brady, crypto’s value proposition is that markets are being disrupted and the nascent asset class may well be here to stay.      “We’re learning more and more about these emerging markets,” he said. “I don’t think it’s going anywhere. … The world is changing. ... And you can be ahead of the curve or behind it, and I'm choosing to be ahead of it.”      Bankman-Fried, who, through FTX, recently bought the naming rights to the stadium where the National Basketball Association's Miami Heat plays, said it’s difficult for people who are “glued to the screen looking at price action” to look away, but he advises traders to do so anyway.      “If the only reason you’re in crypto is because you think prices are going to go up, that’s, OK, I mean, you know, so be it,” he said, adding:      “But … sometimes [prices] go down and that sucks, but if a lot of what you’re coming from is the perspective of, ‘Look, here’s why I think crypto can be really cool and here are the problems I think you can solve’ … I think that’s a good time to take a step back.”    Brady’s NFT play    NFTs may represent the “next generation of interaction between celebrities” and brands with their fans, Brady said.      He said he launched Autograph to be a part of the crypto community, and make it easier for celebrities or popular brands to create collectibles for their current fans.      “When I was a kid, I was a big baseball card collector. Understanding that the kids now in the digital age, you know, are going to want so many things at their disposal on their devices, it's a great opportunity to be involved in that for unique collectibles, but really to provide great experiences for different fans and collectors,” Brady said.      The wide-ranging conversation capped off CoinDesk’s Consensus 2021 event and was moderated by FTX.US COO Sina Nader.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/28/nfl-legend-tom-brady-has-definitely-invested-in-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b2e7570ff0da42f34e2622a0d35a9a009d36c2f6-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
