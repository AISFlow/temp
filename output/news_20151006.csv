42398718,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgR8b,1444167616,Bitcoin Price Hits Highest Level Since August,"The price of bitcoin on the CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) rose to $247.57 today, its highest total since 18th August.  The day's price movement began at roughly 12:20 UTC, but accelerated at 14:00 UTC when the price jumped from $243.01 to $246.15 over a 15-minute span.  The daily high was reached at 15:30 before prices began to edge downward. The price at press time, according to the BPI, is $245.96.  In total, the price move to $247.15 represented a 2.9% increase from $240.56 at the day's opening, and marked the highest total observed on the CoinDesk USD BPI since 18th August, when bitcoin traded at a high of $257.12.  The increases, while tame for the notoriously volatile bitcoin markets, prompted some speculation that the asset may soon test higher levels of support. To date, bitcoin has traded in the $230 range through most of 2015.  Data from Challenger Deep shows volumes have been highest on Bitstamp and Bitfinex, where one-day USD trading volumes have been 20,317 BTC and 12,199 BTC, respectively.  BTC VIX, organizer of the bitcoin trading forum Whale Club, speculated that traders would now be looking to determine whether the market would continue to support a $245 bitcoin, suggesting that should support consolidate, the price could break toward $300.  The increase notably coincides with news that bitcoin exchange platform Gemini will open its order books to traders on Thursday.

42398724,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgRHS,1444164614,Japan's Top Think Tank Launches Blockchain Study,"Japanense think tank Nomura Research Institute (NRI) has announced it will study blockchain technology to assess its use in the securities sector.  Founded in 1965, the organisation is Japan's oldest private think tank, offering consulting services and provides IT solutions for various industries, including finance.  The study, due for completion in January, will inform ""opportunities for practical application,"" the NRI recently announced..  A company spokesperson told CoinDesk:  ""We have done work on blockchain technology before this project, but it was internal. This is our first time to collaborate with external companies regarding a proof of concept project on blockchain technology.""  Alongside Nomura Securities, Japan's largest and oldest securities firm, the NRI said its cross-department team will collaborate with technology startups in the country. Both the NRI and Nomura Securities share a parent company, Nomura Holdings.  Japan is host to a growing number of bitcoin firms, including Tokyo-based exchange BitFlyer and Orb, which announced it had raised $2.3m in seed funding today.  Securities sector  Experts have marked the securities sector – fraught with bottlenecks, silos and paperwork – as one ripe for disruption from distributed ledger technology.  Startups including SETL, Symbiont and Digital Asset Holdings are angling to siphon volume from firms like the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), which clears $1.6 quadrillion annually.  NRI – a publicly traded company – manages many of the post-trade processes that take place in these back offices. Its I-STAR service – created in 1987 – is the de facto solution for Japan's investment banks.  In September, NRI announced it would be providing its Prime Settlement Service – which includes I-STAR – to UBS from next month.  The Swiss investment bank began its own blockchain research with the opening of its experimental London 'lab' in April. Its mission over the next year is to help ""future proof"" the bank, project lead Alex Batlin recently told CoinDesk.  While declining to name any potential partners, the NRI spokesperson did confirm the company's plans to invite overseas companies to join the project as ""technological supporters"".  The spokesperson added:  ""NRI always strives to create new values by increasing the value of the solutions and innovating in new fields, and open innovation is one of the means to achieve that goal.""",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Grace Caffyn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/10/06/japans-top-think-tank-launches-blockchain-study,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7e4d4b4591880dd86bdb0b008c465e925efcba7b-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42398717,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgRAZ,1444160741,US Law Commission to Debate Model Digital Currency Bill in DC,"The Uniform Law Commission (ULC), a nonprofit dedicated to creating consistency among US state laws, is set to discuss a draft version of a model law meant to guide states in the formation of regulation for virtual currencies such as bitcoin this week.  Set to take place from 9th to 11th Octoberhttp://www.uniformlaws.org/shared/docs/regulation%20of%20virtual%20currencies/2015oct_RVCA_Agenda.pdf at the Hyatt Regency in Washington, DC, the three-day event will bring together the ULChttp://www.uniformlaws.org/'s Study Committee on Alternative and Mobile Payment Systems for discussions on specifics of the bill's current provisions, including its recommendations to state legislatures on capital requirements and the cost of licensing.Originally tasked with considering the need for more uniform state legislation on alternative and mobile payment systems in 2014, the group eventually chose digital currencies as its area of emphasis. Ultimately, the first version of the draft billhttp://www.uniformlaws.org/shared/docs/regulation%20of%20virtual%20currencies/2015oct_RVCA_Mtg%20Draft.pdf puts forth a set of initial recommendations for how entities operating ""trusted intermediaries"" in the digital currencies space should be licensed across the US so that requirements are more consistent.  Pillsbury Winthrop attorney Marco Santori, who will be in attendance at the meeting, suggested the goal is to create a law that would do for digital currencies what the Uniform Money Services Act (UMSA) did for money transmission laws.  Santori told CoinDesk:  ""That's how we got the 20 or so laws we have today on money transmission. The same thing is happening with virtual currencies now. It's important, it's not something to ignore. It's a great opportunity to actually write the laws on these issues.""  Covered entities include digital currency converters, exchanges, gateways, payment processors and ATMs, according to the draft, though three article subsections are reserved should additional sub-industries need to be considered before the bill's completion.  The current version suggests the ULC intends the final version of its bill to mirror draft regulation released by the Conference of State Bank Supervisors in September 2015, however, the ULC noted differences between the two sets of recommendations.  For example, the ULC draft document has included a provision that calls for states to enact ""onramp options"" for smaller startups, such as the conditional licensing established in New York by its BitLicense regulation enacted in June 2015.  Elsewhere, the ULC draft made clear it has yet to resolve its opinion on a number of issues, including the types of permissible investments digital currency firms can use as a means to hold corporate funds, and how such entities could appoint authorized delegates, or other businesses that perform money transmission services under another entity's license.  As with all of the provisions in the draft bill, the ULC may revisit deliberations on any issue included in the initial draft, with the goal of releasing the final recommendations in 2016.  Once submitted for approval, the ""Regulation of Virtual Currencies Act"" would then need to be approvedhttp://www.uniformlaws.org/Narrative.aspx?title=Frequently%20Asked%20Questions by the ULC for an annual meeting, with a final vote taking place in which a majority of the 50 states approve the measure for enactment.  Reciprocal licensing  Perhaps most notable among the ULC's proposals is a section on reciprocal licensing, which would allow digital currency businesses governed under the law to engage in services without going through the full licensing process in other states.  Such an agreement would require an unspecified fee, the completion of a license application form and a certification of license history by the applicant, but could potentially establish a framework for organizations that have obtained a BitLicense in New York to more easily become operational in other US states.  The measure could be viewed as positive for startups in the eyes of industry advocates, many of whom have been vocal about how the high costs of industry-specific licensing could effectively price startups out of operation should they be mirrored by other states.  Under the current bill, state commissioners who grant reciprocity and issue a license to a business would need to do so within 30 days, the draft law reads. As part of the arrangement, state commissioners would, the bill suggests, also be able to waive duplicate bonding, net worth and other capital mandates.  Initial feedback from Santori and other industry veterans indicates that the draft repeats language often previously attacked as vague by technology proponents, suggesting that more cumbersome parts of the BitLicense and other existing model regulations could be cemented across the US should the current version be enacted.  ""As its drafted now, it's overly broad and brings in people with no business being regulated,"" Santori said. ""It repeats a lot of mistakes from the early BitLicense.""  Impetus to act  The ULC release marks the end of a process began in late 2014http://www.uniformlaws.org/shared/docs/regulation%20of%20virtual%20currencies/2015AM_RegVirtualCurrencies_IssuesMemo_A.pdf, when the committee called for draft legislation to be prepared and released no later than July 2016.  At the time, the committee called for the ULC to expedite its draft regulation process citing the increasing number of brands and consumers seeking to engage in digital currency transactions, as well as actions by groups such as the Conference of State Bank Supervisors to issue similar guidance to state regulators.  The agency said its goal was to strike a ""balance between a law enacted in 53 jurisdictions but flexible enough not to frustrate innovation"".  ""Because virtual currencies do not enjoy comparable statutory or regulatory underpinnings to other payments systems, the states are under pressure to act,"" the group wrote.  Further highlighting the need for swift action, the group argued, was that California, New York, North Carolina, Kansas and Texas were already considering enacting regulatory schemes, which it suggested could be disparate in their composition.

42398729,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgRMN,1444155905,73% of Finance Pros Think Blockchain Tech Can Thrive Without Bitcoin,"A new survey suggests that many finance professionals see a bright future for blockchain technology – just not one involving bitcoin.  Greenwich Associates, a market intelligence firm, recently released its ""Distributed Ledgers in Capital Markets: Answering the Big Questions"" survey, which follows previous publications that focus on quantifying Wall Street's growing relationship with bitcoin and blockchain technology.  When asked whether Wall Street legal and compliance professionals will trust asset transfers that occur via a blockchain. Thirty-two percent indicated that they believe this trust will definitely take shape, whereas 38% of the 55 respondents queried said they believe this trust will come about ""eventually"".  Thirteen percent said that ""more regulation is needed"" before such an outcome is possible, while 11% said Wall Street will never trust this application of the technology.  Seven percent remained undecided, according to report, which went on to state:  ""For the blockchain or another distributed ledger to provide this clarity to the market, market participants and the legal system would all have to recognize the ledger as the golden copy of who owns what. This is technically possible, but not a reality just yet.""  Blockchain without bitcoin  On the question of whether ""the blockchain can thrive without bitcoin"", 73% of the 55 respondents asked this question said they believe it can.  Yet some respondents indicated otherwise, according to the report:  ""Nearly three-quarters of participants in the [study] believe the blockchain can be put to good use without bitcoin. This result doesn’t scream controversial. But while capital markets professionals (who make up most of our sample) are convinced, those with backgrounds in bitcoin and the blockchain are not.""  Other findings focused on whether alternative technologies, rather than the bitcoin blockchain, can be effectively deployed to create a distributed ledger.  Thirty-three percent of the 54 respondents said that they believe other, unspecified technologies can be used to make ""faster and more robust"" ledgers, whereas 28% said they do not.  Thirty-nine percent said that they were undecided on the matter.  The survey was conducted in May and June of this year, drawing feedback from 102 finance professionals. In July, an additional 55 interviews were conducted as part of the study.

42398721,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgRDW,1444151780,BitPay Creates Bitcoin POS Solution for Ingenico Devices,"BitPay has partnered with payments giant Ingenico to allow brick and mortar stores to accept bitcoin via its point-of-sale (POS) terminals.  The payment solution, unveiled today as part of Blockchain Week, was developed by BitPay and installed on an Ingenico Terminal ICT250.  According to the company, it will be compatible with the majority of Ingenico terminals as they run its operating system, Telium.  Speaking about the integration, Miguel Angel Hernandez, managing director of Ingenico Iberia, said in a statement:  ""Participating in such an important project has allowed Ingenico Group to demonstrate its leadership in the payment space and bring a safe and secure payment method like virtual currency to the end user.""  Customers can pay with bitcoin at applicable Ingenico terminals after merchants generate a QR code by entering the fiat sale price. The code can then be scanned with a bitcoin wallet app.  The France-based company, which employs over 5,000 people globally, reported a revenue of €1.37bn in 2013.  Spreading bitcoin globally  Earlier this year, Ingenico partnered with Paymium to enable retailers in Europe to accept bitcoin payments.  A spokesperson for BitPay, however, said that this new partnership would make this solution available on a global scale. Additionally, he said, all BitPay merchants currently accepting traditional fiat payments via compatible Ingenico terminals can now also accept payments in bitcoin.  ""We are excited to partner with Ingenico Group, one of the leading payment processors in both physical and online commerce. This integration will help us expand bitcoin payments to thousands of retail payments worldwide,"" said BitPay's executive chairman, Tony Gallipi.  The company made headlines last month after it announced it would be reducing the size of its staff in an attempt to ""better align with the pace of growth"" in the industry.

42398723,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgREV,1444138936,21 Inc Pledges Support to Bitcoin's Vanishing Nodes,"21 Inc, the best-funded company in bitcoin, has pledged to support the network's declining number of nodes.  In a blog post co-authored yesterday, CEO Balaji Srinivasan said the firm wants to maintain and incentivise the ""critical mass"" of full nodes, which form the collective 'backbone' that stores and relays all bitcoin transactions.  Today, there are 12% fewer full nodes than this time last year. This continued decline means the bitcoin network – which finds strength in its distributed design – is becoming less stable.  The post reads:  ""Bitcoin full nodes help preserve the health of the bitcoin network by validating blocks and transactions, and then serving those validated transactions to lightweight clients and other full nodes ... As lightweight clients currently make up a significant and growing part of the network, it’s essential that we help them maintain their high level of security – which means maintaining a critical mass of full nodes.""  To do this, 21 has partnered with the BitNodes project, created in 2013 by developer Addy Yeow to assess the health of the network by finding all its reachable nodes.  According to the blog post, Yeow's index, which crawls the network every five minutes to tally up the number of functioning full nodes, will now be hosted by the firm ""in perpetuity"".  Incentives  Unlike miners, who earn freshly-minted bitcoins for their computing power, nodes receive no compensation: often, they are run by enthusiasts altruistically.  To counter this, Yeow created his own Bitnodes Incentive Program, which allows nodes to get a bitcoin reward. This weekly incentive increases as they join the network, for example with 5,000 or more it will be $10, and with 9,000 or more it will be $30.  It's not currently clear if the program is paying out, as it lists only 175 eligible nodes of the 5,974 on the network at press time, while the lowest parameter is 5,000. However 21 is promising to extend the scheme to buyers of its 21 Bitcoin Computer, its first consumer product which debuted two weeks ago to mixed reviews.    The blog post reads:      ""As a generalization of the Bitnodes incentive scheme, you will be mining more bitcoin on a 21 Bitcoin Computer if you run it in full node mode. Think of this as the extra BTC that you earn for being a good member of the Bitcoin community.""            The company says all its products will include full node functionality as standard, however it's unclear whether compensation for users of 21's computer is contingent on Bitnodes reaching a certain figure.  Back in February, Yeow told CoinDesk he was funding the program himself. Whether 21 will now provide these rewards remains unclear.  Foundation's exit  Until last month, the BitNodes project had received support from the Bitcoin Foundation, however director Bruce Fenton told CoinDesk its sponsorship was not renewed due to ""budget and focus considerations"".  Following a messy and very public rethink last year – the ""lean"" organisation is now focused on core development, he said, as its upcoming DevCore workshop indicates.  Though he expressed a wish for projects like BitNodes to be funded in a 'decentralised' manner – ie companies supporting projects they like – he added:  ""A non-profit organisation can do some things that a for-profit organisation cannot and can sometimes help with convening power and neutrality.""",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Grace Caffyn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/10/06/21-inc-pledges-support-to-bitcoins-vanishing-nodes,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6024c87cd68becc06e5430bfdadf8cd822742cc4-1500x512.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
