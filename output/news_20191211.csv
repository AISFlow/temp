42403633,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgTku,1576103444,Circle Confirms New Round of Layoffs Following Co-CEO Departure,"Circle, one of the earliest crypto adopters in the fintech space, has laid off about 10 employees.      The move, first reported by The Block, comes barely a week after the firm’s co-CEO, Sean Neville, announced he would step down from his role at the end of 2019, though he intends to remain on Circle’s Board of Directors.      ""As we continue to focus on advancing our stablecoin business strategy, we've streamlined some departments and eliminated about 10 roles,” a spokesperson told CoinDesk via email.      Circle previously laid off 30 employees in May, citing regulatory concerns and market conditions. At the time, the cut represented roughly 10 percent of the company's total workforce. The spokesperson did not immediately answer a question about the company's current headcount.      Neville said in an email obtained by CoinDesk last week that he would continue working with CENTRE, the company’s collaborative project with crypto exchange Coinbase which issues the USDC stablecoin.      Circle’s sale of Poloniex, the crypto exchange it acquired in 2018, contributed to Neville’s decision, he said.      The company sold Poloniex to an unnamed Asian investment group in October for $400 million. The exchange firewalled U.S. users after the sale, and will now primarily focus on markets outside the U.S.      Justin Sun, the founder of cryptocurrency platform TRON, said he is one of the investors in the investment group in a joint livestream with Poloniex on Twitter despite previously denying being involved.

42403643,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgTrn,1576101357,SEC Charges Shopin CEO With Fraud Over Unregistered $42M ICO,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has charged Shopin and its founder Eran Eyal with fraud after a $42 million initial coin offering.      The SEC announced Wednesday that Eyal had been charged with defrauding investors by selling unregistered securities in the form of Shopin Tokens. While Eyal was supposed to develop a platform which would store and track customer profiles across different retailers, Shopin never built out the system, the agency alleged.      Instead, Eyal ""misappropriated investor funds for his personal use,"" which included a dating service.      Eyal is accused of misappropriating at least $500,000 for his personal use.      A complaint alleges that Eyal ""made at least four misrepresentations in marketing"" the Shopin token, including by claiming that Shopin had successfully conducted a pair of pilot programs, that the company ""had ongoing partnerships"" with multiple retailers, that an unnamed ""prominent Silicon Valley blockchain entrepreneur"" was an advisor to the company and that an unnamed company was an investor in the project.      Eyal also pled guilty to criminal charges brought by the New York Attorney General's office, the release said.      According to a press release shared with CoinDesk on Thursday, Eyal pled guilty to operating three securities fraud schemes, including the Shopin ICO.      Roughly $450,000 in an undisclosed cryptocurrency will be turned over to the New York State Attorney General's office as part of the plea agreement, and Eyal will step down from his role as CEO of Shopin.      He will pay $125,000 in restitution and $475,000 in judgments to investors in Springleap, one of his previous enterprises. Former NYAG Barbara Uunderwood charged him with stealing $600,000 from the company's investors in 2017.      The SEC is also charging Eyal with failing to register the Shopin token sale as a securities sale, and is looking for a permanent injunction, disgorgement, civil penalties, to permanently bar Eyal from acting as an officer or director in any public company, or from participating in any future token sales.      Current NYAG Letitia James reportedly began investigating Shopin and Eyal as far back as June 2019, according to Ventureburn.      Eyal reportedly shared the names and email addresses of his investors with the investigators at the time.

42403628,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgTfz,1576099538,"Jack Dorsey Announces New Twitter Team: Square Crypto, but for Social Media","Jack Dorsey's latest foray into decentralized technology could be a harbinger of a radical shift in social media infrastructure. It all depends on the execution.      On Wednesday, the Twitter and Square CEO announced plans to support an independent team “of up to five open source architects, engineers, and designers to develop an open and decentralized standard for social media.”      “The goal is for Twitter to ultimately be a client of this standard,” Dorsey said.      The new team would follow a model similar to Square Crypto, a bitcoin-focused entity separate from Dorsey's fintech unicorn Square. Likewise, the new Twitter entity would focus on open standards for decentralized processes across social platforms, rather than proprietary structures. Although Dorsey didn’t directly associate the disparate efforts, he hinted that the “fundamentals” of blockchain technology might offer some tools for “open and durable hosting, governance, and even monetization.”      Twitter’s head of legal and policy, Vijaya Gadde tweeted that this new project, called Blue Sky, is part of the company’s broader push to “support and foster the values of a free and open internet.”      Plus, Dorsey tweeted this team would help address “abuse and misleading information,” since global policy enforcement strategies are proving difficult to scale. He also mentioned the propensity for social media to amplify outrage rather than healthy discourse. Since this dynamic has been proven in countless psychology studies, Kaliya Young, co-founder of the Internet Identity Workshop and the startup HumanFirst.Tech, said the Blue Sky team should support “experts who have been in the trenches working for years” instead of starting from scratch.      “Social threat modeling should be done to understand how [social media] is impacting people,” Young said. “Technical protocols for content interoperability doesn’t solve content moderation or community management problems.”      Young said she was even a little offended by the “arrogance” of this announcement, which failed to acknowledge groups have already been working on open standards for social media for a decade. Security researcher and Open Privacy nonprofit founder Sarah Jamie Lewis echoed this point with a tweet likening decentralized social media standards to the “next generation of Pokémon.”      For example, the Social Web Working Group has already published guidelines for activity streams through the World Wide Web Consortium. There’s also been considerable open-source work on decentralized identifiers, basically social profile data that belongs to the user and can be used across the internet rather than being tied to a platform like Facebook. The head of affiliated projects at Microsoft, Daniel Buchner, promptly tweeted to say he’d love to collaborate with Blue Sky.    Pie in the sky?    This Blue Sky team will have such a lofty directive that it’s hard to imagine which issues they’ll tackle first.      To be fair, Square Crypto had a similarly ambitious model when it was first announced by Dorsey in March, promptly filling only the technical positions mentioned in subsequent tweets.      “If he’s serious, he’ll hire people who have really done this before,” Young said, referencing incumbent experts like Shireen Mitchell, Sydette Harry and Ben Werdmuller.      Another decentralized social network veteran, Tim Pastoor, founder of the Netherlands-based digital identity startup 2way.io, said he believes personal identity management is one of the keys to promoting healthy social networks.      “If you filter information only to trusted sources, you can listen to their friends and their friends, because the chances of there being trolls and sock pockets is fairly small,” he said.      Pastoor also supports the open-source project Iris, which is a peer-to-peer platform similar to Twitter that leverages mesh grids for when the internet goes down.      Whoever joins the Blue Sky team, it’s already clear that blockchain technology will play a significant role in the project. Twitter CTO Parag Agrawal tweeted the ideal candidates for this team should be “curious across disciplines” and have “experience working in the open on the blockchain.”      Pastoor said he’s not sure how blockchain is relevant to any of the issues Dorsey identified, but he’s curious to see how Twitter will sponsor innovation. Pastoor likened support for this independent team to how AT&T's research contributed to the invention of the transistor at Bell Labs in 1947.      “It led them to invest in the invention of the transistor, which led to automatic switching of information so you could punch in a number and be connected to anybody on the network, anywhere,” Pastoor said. “That’s basically what [Twitter] is looking to do as well, to automate the job these moderators are doing.”      From his perspective, Pastoor says decentralized protocols will enable even more intermediaries and companies facilitating activity across social networks, which is fine as long as users have some level of control and independence. To be sure, the Blue Sky team’s work will need to think beyond both Twitter’s business model and the general open-source process to “business models for the various entities participating around a decentralized standard,” Argawal tweeted.      Although Dorsey isn’t unique in his goal of supporting healthy and decentralized social networks, the announcement was generally received by Twitter audiences as a positive step.      Neha Narula, director of research at MIT's Digital Currency Initiative, responded to Dorsey’s announcement by tweeting a 100-page report on the hurdles of trying to build a decentralized web.      “Welcome to the party,” Young concluded.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | RESEARCH,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/12/11/jack-dorsey-announces-new-twitter-team-square-crypto-but-for-social-media,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

42403648,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgTvj,1576094954,The Year in Crypto Journalism: Truth Will Always Be Human,"This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. David Z. Morris is a staff writer covering A.I., blockchain, and other technology for Fortune Magazine. He was formerly a staff writer at BreakerMag, and is the author of the book Bitcoin is Magic, about the role of communication in crypto.      Despite continuing doldrums in the token markets, 2019 saw solid progress for many parts of the blockchain/crypto ecosystem – including for crypto media, research, and journalism. We saw Michael Casey bring his Wall Street Journal credibility to leadership of this publication. Messari accomplished great things with its transparency initiative for crypto projects. The Block transitioned from unknown startup to regular newsbreaker, and Decrypt Media continues to build credibility and expertise.      2019 also, sadly, saw the end of Breaker Magazine, an attempt to bring thoughtful cultural reporting to the space. I’m biased, since I worked there, but many people felt we succeeded on the quality front. We ultimately fell short on the business side (for reasons that aren’t the fault of any former Breaker staff) – a reminder that making quality journalism economically viable is pretty difficult in 2019.      Both these successes and failures make it all the more disheartening that so many in the crypto-sphere have so little respect for journalism, either in general, or as a part of this industry. This disdain manifests in dismissals of reported news as “FUD,” and even in attacks on journalists personally. This was on particularly clear display in a recent fight between The Block and Binance over reporting about the closure of an office in China, when one of the most prominent leaders in the space joined hands with one of its most brazen hucksters to fund public attacks on critical journalists.      There are a lot of reasons for this hostility, some of them legitimate. A number of “crypto news” sites are in fact corrupt, crappy, or both (a fact that is much clearer thanks to intrepid work by Corin Faife for Breaker). The bagholders of the world would rather no one highlighted the shortcomings of projects they’re invested in – in crypto, or in the stock market. And of course, the U.S. President has normalized the idea that news you don’t like can simply be dismissed as biased “fake news.”      But there are also some flawed ways of thinking that are specific to crypto. If you, like me, want to see crypto’s high-minded rhetoric turn into transformative products and services someday, I think it’s worth reflecting on a couple of those errors as we head into 2020.    You’re a Founder, Not a God    One particularly notable element of the Binance/The Block debate was the question of anonymous sourcing. When The Block published a followup detailing their reporting process, they revealed that they had learned details about the office closure linked to Binance from suppliers, partners, and other sources who chose to remain anonymous.      Anonymous sourcing is a common practice in business journalism – in fact, developing source relationships outside of official channels is how the very best journalists in the game create valuable knowledge. Those sources understandably want to protect their relationships by remaining anonymous.      But former Coinbase executive Balaji Srinivasan raised a concern in response to the followup –that if someone is concealing their identity to reveal delicate information, can they be trusted?            I have immense respect for Srinivasan’s intellect. In this case, he went well beyond most skeptics by clearly spelling out his thought process. I do think this specific argument is based on some flawed premises – but even then, I only draw attention to it because those premises seem to be widely shared, and are productive fodder for reflection, not because I think Balaji is a bad guy. Far from it.      To address his first point, relying on a single anonymous source for a story is indeed bad journalism, and ripe for abuse. That’s why good journalists don’t do it – stories like The Block’s use multiple sources to independently confirm findings.      Of course, trusting such a report also requires trust in the outlet and reporter relaying the information, and when it comes to a young organization like The Block, some skepticism is natural. And The Block does seem to have made a mistake in its original reporting, describing a “police raid” based on a source’s description, then revising it to a “visit.” Such missteps must be learning opportunities – but they’re also an inevitable risk of sniffing out information that someone doesn’t want you to know.      Srinivasan’s second point is more troubling. He argues, in essence, that being part of an organization requires unwavering loyalty to the official positions of its leadership. Breaking an NDA isn’t just a legal matter here, it’s a moral failure that undermines the speaker’s credibility.    Leaders who don’t listen to critical or independent voices wind up like Travis Kalanick, Elizabeth Holmes, or most recently, disgraced WeWork CEO Adam Neumann.    But this assumes that the leaders of organizations are themselves infallible, that their judgments and positions should not be challenged by their underlings. In fact, many anonymous sources speak to the media because they are loyal – because they care deeply about the organizations and missions they signed up for, but believe their leaders are making dangerous errors. Often, sources speak to the media only after they have tried to raise issues internally, and found no one willing to listen.      In this light, anonymous sourcing is deeply aligned with the broader ethos of crypto. By giving people freedom from the control of major banks and governments – including through anonymity – cryptocurrency upholds a broad moral principle of freedom, and also unleashes individual creative forces that have been quashed by the excesses of authority. Similarly, by going outside the chain of command, anonymous sources are often attempting to get their individual insights into the public eye and save their leaders from themselves.      Binance even defended itself in this incident by arguing that it couldn’t have an office in Shanghai because its workers are “decentralized.” But this is a sad diminution of the concept of decentralization. It’s not about geography – it’s about power. If Binance shares the principles that drove the creation of bitcoin, being an employee there shouldn’t entail unwavering personal loyalty to Changpeng Zhao, or anyone else.      Starting a company is very hard, and the people who do it successfully are extraordinary, but being extraordinary isn’t the same thing as being perfect (there are also, it should be noted, a lot of ways of being extraordinary that don’t involve starting a company, or even making a lot of money). Leaders who don’t listen to critical or independent voices – who engage in blanket denialism of anything that conflicts with their internal narrative – wind up like Travis Kalanick, Elizabeth Holmes, or most recently, disgraced WeWork CEO Adam Neumann. All three indulged some variation of the “fake news” maneuver to rebuff criticism, and eventually saw their companies taken from them because of the very problems they refused to confront.      Neumann and Kalanick, at least, are still rich – as are a shocking number of crypto ‘leaders’ who have produced even less of real value than those men. But Kalanick and especially Neumann will be walking punchlines for the rest of their natural lives, and then they’ll be taught as cautionary tales in business school for perhaps decades more.      That is the bitter harvest of yelling “FUD” when you should be confronting inconvenient truths.    Math Can't Solve for Truth    I think there’s something even deeper than deference to authority embedded in crypto's skepticism towards journalists. To people reared on the abstract rationality and self-contained logic of computers, the process of uncovering real-world truth can seem mysterious, and even intimidating. Dismissing journalists as simply malicious liars is a way to calm that anxiety.      You can see this manifested in several blockchain projects aimed at building a new model for discovering the truth through so-called ‘crypto-economics.’ Broadly, these projects aim to fix problems in journalism by reducing the role of individuals in making judgments about the truth. Instead, they want to distribute that authority to the many.      Civil remains the highest-profile example, though its initial plan to use a kind of betting market to measure the reliability of news sources has fallen by the wayside. TruStory and a variety of ‘token curated registries’ (TCRs) use token incentives to both solicit and evaluate arguments or speakers, again through betting markets with, in theory, many users.      (Side note: I’m not talking here about prediction markets like Augur. The bets made there generally resolve based on concrete events, not judgments on the ‘truth’ of a particular statement or argument. Oh, and the concrete events are – wait for it – reported by reputable journalists.)    Voting, betting, or information markets will never replace professional journalism and other forms of refined critical thinking.    This desire makes sense in light of crypto’s overall ethos, particularly its healthy (if sadly waning) antipathy towards concentrated authority and power. But, at least when it comes to the pursuit of the truth, it’s an absolute fool’s errand. Voting, betting, or information markets will never replace professional journalism and other forms of refined critical thinking – and ironically, math and economics show us why.      First, projects like Civil, TruStory or TCRs are always at risk of becoming what’s known as a Keynesian Beauty Contest. To take TruStory as an example: the system asks users to stake tokens to write a persuasive argument, then let other users vote on the argument. If their argument attracts positive votes, the original staker wins a bonus. If it is downvoted, they are heavily penalized.      If you haven’t noticed already, this system incentivizes users to write arguments that other users already agree with. It parallels Keynes’ original thought experiment, which was that judges rewarded for accurately predicting the most popular faces in a beauty contest are motivated to follow the crowd, not to use their own judgment. The same goes for TCRs and the (hypothetical) Civil system. Once you know who holds the tokens in any such system, you’re strongly motivated to simply go with the flow.      TruStory’s founder described the project’s intended dynamics as using “‘skin in the game’ to incentivize people to vote on the veracity of claims and not deviate from the profitable-truth-seeking majority.” But the idea that the majority have, or even seek, the truth is questionable at best.      The long historical process of truth-finding that created the advanced society we live in now didn’t rely on mass opinion. If Copernicus or Pasteur had put their revolutionary ideas up to a vote, we might still be drawing insane spirals to explain the sun’s path around the earth, and cursing the “miasmas” causing disease in poor neighborhoods. Instead, heliocentrism and the germ theory of disease became conventional wisdom through the much slower process of convincing one person at a time, using substantive argument, fact-based evidence, and the reputation of the individual speaker.      That may be why, roughly a year after its founding, TruStory dramatically changed its mission from leveraging economic games in “the pursuit of truth” to, more modestly, “creating a safe space to debate.”    But This Is Wondrous Strange    There’s a second reason the way we seek the truth isn’t going to change. Before crypto-economics existed, there was formal logic. The goal of formal logic is to reduce linguistic statements to mathematical formulas, whose internal consistency can then be tested. Its creation was motivated by much the same goals as crypto-economic truth models: to make reason itself simpler, more streamlined, and more definitive. Formal logic thrived in the late 19th century, and some might have thought it heralded a new age of clear, simple truth.      Then along came this kid named Kurt Gödel.      In 1931 (when Gödel was in his mid-twenties) he presented a pair of equations known as the Incompleteness Theorems. These were mathematical formulas that indisputably proved something completely terrifying: that no self-contained system of formal logic can prove its own internal consistency.      To oversimplify the implications of this mathematical fact: there is always something outside what you think you know. There is always new information, a new interpretation. Or as Jurassic Park’s Dr. Ian Malcolm put it: Nature finds a way.      Ultimately, the project of formal logic has not given humans a simplified, rational understanding of the world, because the real world, including the human world, never stops moving, changing, and growing. Truths important to human society are discovered and propagated through a complex, subtle, and radically individualized process.      And only those who are willing to brave the flawed, forever imperfect nature of what we call “the truth” – instead of rejecting it in favor of an illusion of mathematical clarity – can ever hope to thrive. The market has its own verdict on this: after raising $3 million in 2018, TruStory shut down last week, though it will continue as an open-source project.      Ultimately, then, I see at least two big, unpleasant reasons for crypto’s hostility towards journalists. First, it reflects our broader culture’s disastrous belief that being successful in one pursuit means you are an authority on all matters. And second, it reflects crypto’s particular bias towards a reductive, mathematical vision of the world.      But money can’t buy the truth. There is no power that can make the world align with your beliefs about it. And to risk paraphrasing the greatest delver of human mysteries the West has produced: If math is your philosophy, there are more things in heaven and earth than it can dream of.      Refusing to see them won’t make them go away.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | BNB,David Z.

42403642,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgTqo,1576093711,Kraken: $75 Device Will Get You Into Crypto Hardware Wallet KeepKey,"Kraken Security Lab said crypto hardware wallet KeepKey is not doing enough to protect customers from physical attacks, saying it was able to get into the system using a $75 device.       “All that is required is physical access to the wallet for about 15 minutes,” the firm said in a blog post on Tuesday.       Kraken Security Lab said KeepKey is already aware of similar physical attacks, but seems to be focusing more on protecting users’ keys from remote attacks, citing a statement from KeepKey’s parent Shapeshift on June 13.       The attacks can extract seeds that could help users restore and backup their wallets from a voltage glitching device costing roughly $75.       However, Michael Perklin, chief information security officer of Shapeshift, said Kraken Security’s statement is misleading, according to a statement received by CoinDesk. The crypto exchange acquired hardware wallet startup KeepKey for an undisclosed amount in August 2017 to develop its technology and security for its crypto holders.       “Not only does this attack require physical possession of the device, it would require significant preparation and expertise, as well as specialized equipment,” Perklin said.       “The cost is possible only if the person had an extremely sophisticated understanding of what was needed,” he added. “The average person would not have the education about hardware design or computer science to go pick out parts for $75 and successfully assemble a tool to use for this type of attack.”       Kraken Security Lab said in its blog post that while physical attacks are difficult to defend against, it found Keepkey’s focus on remote attacks “potentially out of line with the branding of [its] product.”       Perklin responded that KeepKey took measures to protect its users from potential physical attacks before Kraken notified it.       “We recommend our users use BIP39 passphrases that add an extra layer of security,” Perklin said. “The process is relatively easy and we provided step-by-step instructions on how to set up BIP39 in the June 13 statement.”       One of the reasons such physical attacks are difficult to prevent is KeepKey has to redesign its hardware. In particular, Kraken Security Lab claims, the wallet needs to change the microcontroller because of “inherent flaws” that could be used by hackers.       “It is important to understand that if you physically lose your KeepKey, this vulnerability could be used to access your crypto,” according to the blog post.       “It’s much like a door lock analogy. You can change the locks on your door as often as you want, but someone with enough time and expertise can always pick the lock,” Perklin responded.      “Redesigning KeepKey, or using a different microcontroller, might slow down an attacker if they have the physical device, but it will not stop them if they are determined, skilled and have enough time to break in,” he added.       Kraken Security Lab said it disclosed the full details of this threat of attack to KeepKey on Sept. 11 and is going public now so the crypto community can protect itself. Shapeshift confirmed it received the information and had asked its users to use the BIP39 passphrase before that time.",NEGATIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,David Pan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2019/12/11/kraken-75-device-will-get-you-into-crypto-hardware-wallet-keepkey,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/297762260cec0807a835bc07ac40967c58138eb3-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Announced Wednesday via Square Crypto’s Twitter account, freelance Lightning and bitcoin contributor ZmnSCPxj received a grant from the company to further development of the bitcoin network. The grant’s total was not disclosed.      The pseudonymous developer is known for his work throughout the Lightning developer community, working on both the Lightning Labs and c-Lightning implementations over the past two years, another tweet said.

The partnership, announced Wednesday, would merge D-Wave's quantum offering with NEC's classical computing environments.      NEC will also invest $10 million in the company and sell the D-Wave Leap quantum computing service alongside its traditional services.      “Japan is the birthplace of quantum annealing and has remained a global leader in quantum application development,” said Alan Baratz, D-Wave executive VP of research and development. “Our collaboration with global pioneer NEC is a major milestone in the pursuit of fully commercial quantum applications.”      Quantum has long been thought to be the next step in computing but the technology has gotten off to a slow start. While Google is claiming ""quantum supremacy"" by performing quantum tasks in a matter of seconds that would otherwise take a regular computer thousands of years to complete, the kinds of work able to be done on a quantum computer - including any form of crypto mining - is limited.      The importance of the NEC partnership is clear when looking at D-Wave's current cloud offerings. D-Wave's Leap program gives users free access to a D-Wave 2000Q computer and a full SDK to take advantage of their machines. That said, there have been few visible, practical implementations of this quantum architecture. The NEC partnership aims to change that.      ""NEC and D-Wave will work with customers to develop applications that harness the power of their collaborative hybrid systems and solve practical business and scientific problems across a variety of industries,"" according to a D-Wave press release.      ""Our collaboration is aimed at fueling application development and business value today,"" said Motoo Nishihara, CTO at the NEC Corporation.      The goal, therefore, is to get quantum computing into the hands of real businesses that need to solve real problems, something that might be easier said than done.      “A decade ago people said it would take 50 years to get where we are now with quantum computing. Five years ago, they said it would take 25 years to get where we are now. So quantum computing has this nasty habit of exceeding people’s expectations,” said Adam Koltun of the Quantum Resistant Ledger (QRL) Foundation after Google's announcement. “The blockchain industry does need to grapple with this and be wary.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MINING | SPONSORED | RESEARCH,John Biggs,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2019/12/11/d-wave-and-nec-partner-to-create-hybrid-quantum-applications,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dcc8adffeb7fb6e57bfa74826bc9c87ba3bdc036-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

ConsenSys chief Joe Lubin informed the teams via email that they would be closed down, people familiar with the situation said.      A member of the seven-person team in India confirmed the closures of the local office and the Philippines operation but referred further questions to the main office in Brooklyn, N.Y.      ""A total of 11 roles were eliminated in India and the Philippines due to a realignment of the sales and services team in those countries,"" said ConsenSys spokesperson Kara Miley, offering no other details.

42403635,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgTlt,1576081800,What the Wild History of Digital Currency Tells Us About the Future,"This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Finn Brunton is an assistant professor at NYU and the author of Digital Cash: The Unknown History of the Anarchists, Technologists, and Utopians Who Created Cryptocurrency (2019) and Spam: A Shadow History of the Internet (2013).      How does Libra resemble a central bank? What role did the Soviet Union have in the development of credit cards? Why did a desire to live forever drive forward the creation of digital currencies?      These are all questions Finn Brunton is prepared to ask and answer, after a decade-long career as a historian of technology and media. I met the New York University professor in his 7th floor office on Greene St., where we discussed his academic interest: the wild and varied cultural history of digitally-native currencies.      In his latest book, Digital Cash: The Unknown History of the Anarchists, Utopians, and Technologists Who Created Cryptocurrency (Princeton University Press, 2019), Brunton yokes together seemingly heterogenous subcultures and ideas to tell the untold story of cryptocurrency’s emergence.      “A lot of what we're seeing emerging today is really interesting, not because it's futuristic, but because it's archaic,” Brunton said. “And I don't mean that as a pejorative.”      Below is a condensed transcript of our conversation.      How did you first get interested in cryptocurrency?      I was trained as a historian of science and technology, and I wrote a book about the history of spam. In some ways, it showed how the Internet has taken shape. I discovered how the need for advertising made a lot of internet shitty. So much of the malware distribution, the bad content, and the trash that we have to cope with online is because the way to pay for anything, outside of venture capital, became ads.      There was a legacy of people who have tried to come up with alternative ways to pay for stuff online. They tried to come up with other ways of moving money around, whether that be through experimental micro-payments or through all kinds of new platforms. But instead of visionary micro-payments systems, advertising became the basis of financing. I saw bitcoin the way a lot of people saw it at the time, as an interesting technical experiment, or as a fun, hobbyist attempt to solve the problems people have been trying to solve for 20 years. As a historian, I realized I had found a way to approach the subject of digital money. I could follow different groups trying to create exchangeable digital tokens of value.      Were the projects capable of escaping the “shitty Internet,” as you call it?      I became really obsessed with David Chaum. I would just read his old papers that led to Digicash. It held water. Mathematically, it worked. They had a company. They had funding. They were having meetings with big players. It was all starting to come together, and then it evaporates. You keep finding things like that. One of the really interesting questions the historian can ask is: why did this not happen?    If we imagine a nightmare version of Facebook's Libra, where a company has complete oversight over your money, they can start setting up all kinds of sweetheart deals. You start wiping out the ability of the market to function.    What are the conditions for cryptocurrency’s success?      The history of the cryptocurrency project can be traced to the 1970s. One key factor was the fear of future surveillance. Both surveillance and the possibility to more directly manipulate transaction data. I wrote about Paul Armor, a computer scientist who worked on and off in the Department of Defense, and at Rand in the 70s, where they asked him to design a next-gen surveillance system, to keep tabs on the Soviet Union and anticipate their moves. His team came up with an electronic payments system. They realized tracking money flows gives you useful information. It means that you have a time-stamped, geocoded record of every time someone pays for something. You have a really fine-grained dossier of everybody's movements and activities, and the transaction data itself. So you know where they are, what they're interested in, what they're like. A lot of the people who are working on the earliest stages of digital cash were preparing for when most of the economy and commerce goes digital, so everyone would be under surveillance and coercion at a level never really seen before. That's the context when we see the need for digital currency [bitcoin] appear. Not just to make things more efficient, but to protect people from the incursions of surveillance and power.      It seems like people are willing to give up a measure of privacy for the convenience of electronic payments.      Chaum was conscious of throwing off the balance of power between customers and corporations. If a corporation knows how much you're good for, they can price-gouge you beyond the market rate.We’re going to start seeing all kinds of manipulation. If we imagine a nightmare version of Facebook's Libra, where a company has complete oversight over your money, they can start setting up all kinds of sweetheart deals. You start wiping out the ability of the market to function.      You’re seeing a similar debate with companies attempting to throttle internet speeds.      Yeah, if everyone’s biggest freak out with net neutrality was applied to money, then you start to see the scale of the danger.      What’s your favorite subculture working on digital cash?      The people working on cryptocurrency at the beginning were also generally working on cryptography, so they knew how easy digital surveillance was and how hard the government was fighting to keep strong cryptography out of the hands of ordinary people. There are other agendas that come into play. American libertarians are both anti-surveillance and interested in new forms of currency. You have two kinds of libertarians. Those with a classic hard money agenda, the von Mises approach, who wanted money marked by a scarce store of value, or digital gold currencies. The other libertarian thread says there should be a proliferation of new forms of money and new kinds of banks that are able to issue money. Then you can let market mechanisms [take over].      It seems a lot of the heat that Libra takes, especially from politicians and regulators in the EU, is because it will compete with national currencies, right?      Absolutely. The reason central bankers scrutinize things like Libra is because it is a threat to monetary sovereignty. Central bankers are historically fixated on two issues. One the one hand, the maintenance of national sovereignty, prestige, and the trading power of the currency. On the other hand: contagion. They fear that new innovations are going to be unstable and poorly overseen, and people will put a bunch of value into them, and then the experiments will vanish or die, and that will set off chaos in the rest of the economy.      But Libra isn’t intended as a speculative investment.      Governments react to new currencies from the perspective of maintaining sovereign control of currency as well as from the perspective of disruption to the larger economy. I like to contrast Libra with the ideas presented at Bretton Woods. Keynes’ solution to the problem of the post-war global monetary order was to have banks act as a settlement system for managing the balance of trade between nations. This would keep chaos in one country from affecting other countries. But the person who won out over Keynes was Harry Dexter White, who proposed instead that the U.S. dollar should act as the world's reserve currency. If Keynes argued the agenda of a central bank is to maintain economic stability by keeping everything in equilibrium, avoiding depressions, running mild inflation, White’s argument was that the goal of the central bank should be the maintenance of the power of the nation by making USD the global-reserve system.    If everyone’s biggest freak out with net neutrality was applied to money, then you start to see the scale of the danger.    There are reportedly ongoing experiments at the Federal Reserve with digital dollars. The Chair of the Federal Reserve in Texas, actually, recently said they're “active looking” at developing a U. S. Dollar-pegged stablecoin. How do you think this fits into current official monetary policy?      Central banks have a history of being extremely conservative, but also very interested in technological experimentation. At the same time, they're also super super gun-shy about doing anything wrong. There's this wonderful term from David Edgerton, a historian of technology, called “reserve technologies.” It’s that, even if you have a new technology that works well, you tend to keep some of the old ones around. Like the way a house will have electric light, but keep candles in a drawer. You can see that in the technological infrastructure behind banking. With the scale of something like the Federal Reserve, they have to be conservative and careful about financial technologies.      There’s this magnificent history, which I don't think has ever been formally written about, about how the Federal Reserve kept the country functioning after 9/11. When the nerve centers for credit and interbank settlement were suddenly fucked and there was all of this chaos, they told the banks that the credit system would remain functional, that the discount window is open, even if we have drive 18 wheelers around the country filled with checks.      They had fallback positions for everything.So, if I were to make a prediction about what's going to happen with cryptocurrencies at large, I would pay attention to how they're getting boring. Wherever it departs from the visionary agendas of crypto, large, stable, boring organizations are getting interested in it for interbank settlement or the creation of explicitly stablecoin platforms.      Based on your historical perspective, how long is it going to take for crypto to get that point?      The most important vehicles of value for the previous several centuries were bills of exchange, or ledger mechanisms for assigning people part ownership in something. Entire mercantile networks across Europe and the Middle East were sustained on systems of ledgers and contracts that were all about known and irrefutable identities that could be entered. I would not be surprised if the underlying mechanisms for these historical vehicles of value were based on things that function, in some ways, like blockchains.      In the long term, I’m interested in how we move away from cash and towards the idea of holding things in ledgers as collateral. Our lives will be based around holding our passwords to our wallet that contains our tokens of money that we exchange with each other.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/12/11/what-the-wild-history-of-digital-currency-tells-us-about-the-future,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ce65fe337d03c78ed1cefdeaab057b82ca45dc5d-1440x756.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403644,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgTsm,1576074600,"Never Mind Consumers, This Was a Year of Steady Infrastructural Progress","This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Jake Brukhman is the founder and managing director of CoinFund.      After a partial recovery in the first half of 2019, the crypto markets were thrown to international government scrutiny and regulatory uncertainty mid-year, a phase marked by Facebook’s public launch of Libra in June. Far from the market recovery investors had hoped for following the 2018 crypto bear market, the blockchain space progressed in technological maturity while seemingly underperforming “crypto-focused” expectations. Nevertheless, digital assets have added 63% to their aggregate market capitalization so far in 2019 (as of writing in November). Even if 2019 wasn’t characterized by frothy speculative trading and dramatic highs as in previous years, it was a year of infrastructural progress.      Despite having operable smart contract blockchains like Ethereum in production, projects have struggled with product-market fit for decentralized applications in recent years. The industry might simply be too early. If we look back to how “mobile applications” progressed, they didn’t really solidify into a multi-billion dollar business until their infrastructure -- smartphones like iPhone and mobile operating systems like Android -- became extremely accessible, usable, and affordable. In the same way, blockchain infrastructure in the form of scalable blockchains, user-friendly wallet experiences, node and data services, and financial industry support for digital assets, might be a prerequisite to building decentralized applications at a rate which produces mainstream market fit. This kind of infrastructural progress was the subject of 2019.      Down in the lower layers of the decentralization stack, several second-generation smart contract platforms -- notably Polkadot, Cosmos, Tezos, and NEAR -- provided innovations in throughput, interoperability, network governance, and usability, and are challenging Ethereum’s market share and winding 2.0 roadmap. Additionally, Dapper Labs announced Flow, a base layer dedicated to mainstream-facing usability of games and their non-fungible tokens and digital assets, while simultaneously announcing a major partnership, NBA Top Shot.    If critics like Nouriel Roubini could claim uncertain scalability prospects for blockchain before, 2019 proved them wrong.    If critics like Nouriel Roubini could claim uncertain scalability prospects for blockchain before, 2019 proved them wrong. The next order of blockchain scalability magnitude is here. First, new base layers have become faster by virtue of employing advanced consensus algorithms, sharding, and parallelism. Coda, a cryptocurrency that uses zero-knowledge proofs to shrink the storage footprint of its blockchain, went into testnet and kicked off a new variety of base layer that can run on a mobile phone. Finally, a number of “layer 2” technologies -- such as Connext’s state channels or Matter Labs’ ZK rollup technologies -- have made progress in enabling fast payments and cheaper, scalable, and privacy-preserving smart contracts. At the same time, technologies like GEO Protocol have put an emphasis on cross-chain interoperability for instant exchange across distinct blockchains, networks, and even traditional fiat payment rails.      Much of the traction that does not come from exchanges or trading has been generated decidedly in infrastructure layers in 2019. Node infrastructure provider Blockdaemon, having recognized the market’s propensity to proliferate new decentralized networks, is generating revenue across an impressive 22 such networks today and continues to grow month over month. The Graph is serving over 400 public smart contract subgraphs, with request volume clocking millions of daily data queries. Meanwhile, 3Box’s self-sovereign identity and data solution is rapidly integrating across the Ethereum ecosystem, within wallets like MetaMask and many of the new user onboarding solutions, like Portis and Authereum, and even governance experiment MolochDAO.      Blockchain’s road to mainstream adoption depends on institutional backing of businesses that support blockchain infrastructure and enable traditional investors both to capitalize and participate in digital asset networks. As such, the compliance levels of exchanges have been increasing to support institutional clients. Fidelity, ErisX, Ledger, and ICE have all launched digital asset custody products eyeing institutions who have custodial requirements and are considering digital asset exposure. Finally, more than 20 blockchain-focused analytics firms are on the market, and some have been gradually honing their offerings for enterprise-grade customers.      From legal DAO wrappers to fiat on-ramps to zero knowledge proof systems, the breadth of 2019’s infrastructural innovations doesn’t fit into a single article. But this improved infrastructure will power the next generation of blockchain products for investors, institutions, enterprises, and mainstream customers in 2020. As the lower levels of the blockchain technology stack mature, we’ll look back on 2019 as the start of the blockchain adoption journey.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Jake Brukhman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2019/12/11/never-mind-consumers-this-was-a-year-of-steady-infrastructural-progress,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6c4da08edcbbe3b0c6f8ecf16f751aa5a25ed4e3-1346x1146.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42403638,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgTms,1576074112,New York Regulator Details Changes to Contentious BitLicense,"The New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) is getting specific about how it will update its controversial virtual currency license.      Announced Wednesday by Superintendent Linda Lacewell at a breakfast held by Crain’s New York, the proposed guidance will modify the approval process for listing new cryptocurrencies. Under the current regime, NYDFS approves every cryptocurrency offered within the state on a case-by-case basis with individual exchanges.      The guidance released Wednesday includes two specific updates the public can comment on: Any coins the regulator approves for listing in New York can be listed by any exchange that operates in the state, as long as they provide notice to NYDFS; and the regulator will publish a model framework for coin listings that exchanges should model their versions around.      ""It's more than time to take another look at the virtual currency regulation given the passage of time, changes in the industry, maturation, sophistication and new business models,"" she said. ""What tweaks and changes can we make should we make because, while it is our obligation to regulate, we only want to have enough regulation to get the job done and not a drop more.""      NYDFS is accepting comment on its new public framework until Jan. 27, 2020. According to a press release, this is only a first step in the regulator’s review of the license.      Existing licensees will not have to re-apply, Lacewell said.      The new framework looks at how an exchange approaches a coin’s governance, risk and monitoring, with each category including a number of concerns the regulator would like to see addressed before approving any listing.      ""The idea being that you already have a license, you already have passed muster and have the controls in place, you are subject to examination by us,"" she said. ""And we've approved a lot of coins since the early days so can [we] cut through the red tape and can we get to a place where responsible licensed companies can self-certify under appropriate guidance that we're putting forward?""      The five-year-old framework, originally referred to as the BitLicense, has long proven controversial, with exchanges such as Kraken and ShapeShift pulling out of New York entirely after it was passed under previous NYDFS Superintendent Ben Lawsky.      To date, 24 exchanges, bitcoin teller machine providers and other crypto companies have been granted the license, including major firms such as Coinbase and Circle.      However, Lacewell, who took office earlier this year, announced in October during DC Fintech Week that she was reviewing the existing regulatory framework, although she provided few details.      She told CoinDesk at the time that the crypto industry had changed since the license was first fully implemented in 2015, and it was “a good time” to evaluate what this evolution meant for the license.      “How has the industry grown? Has it matured in any way? And I don’t want to get too specific but, you know, it’s a good time for a second look,” Lacewell said at the time.      Wednesday’s unveiling is the latest in a series of moves NYDFS has made this year to bolster its cryptocurrency chops. The regulator announced it was creating a division to oversee cryptocurrency in July, dubbed the Research and Innovation Division.      ""We're recruiting in the cryptocurrency space because we need more people,"" Lacewell said Wednesday.

Bitfury did not say how much it is investing in the product.      The deal, as outlined in a press statement Wednesday, will see Bitfury invest in Shyft’s Financial Action Task Force (FATF) travel compliance solution.      Under the FATF’s June guidance, crypto exchanges face tough requirements in documenting, disclosing and sharing their customers’ data. A blockchain-based compliance solution could be one way to coordinate moving that information across exchanges.    Shyft has been building out its travel rule product’s partners and teams for much of 2019. It onboarded two former FATF executives in October and, according to its websitehttps://www.shyft.network/partners, claims it has at least 20 partners across the industry.    Now, Bitfury subsidiaries Exonum, an enterprise blockchain firm, and Crystal, an on-chain analysis firm, will also be joining that effort, the press release said.      Notably, Shyft has not announced virtual asset service providers like Binance and Bitfinex – the actual target of the FATF travel rule – as partners at the time of publication. Joseph Weinberg, co-founder of Shyft, hinted in an email statement that exchanges are indeed assisting in the product set to launch alongside the Shyft mainnet early next year.      “We're actively working on pre-integration testing with our exchange partners, and aiming for release of the Travel Rule solution during [first quarter] 2020,” Weinberg said.      The partnership will also bolster the company’s government-facing digital identity solution, according to the press release. Shyft is building such a system for the government of Bermuda in conjunction with Perseid.      Weinberg said more governments may also contract with Shyft.      “We have been working with several African and western countries [that] are looking to adopt the identity platform for different use cases in 2020,” he said.

42403646,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgTuk,1576072800,Australia's Stock Exchange Backs $35M Round for DLT Survivor Digital Asset,"Digital Asset (DA) has raised $35 million in Series C funding, signaling a comeback for the enterprise blockchain startup a year after the sudden departure of former CEO Blythe Masters.      The funding came from a combination of new and existing investors led by Jefferson River Capital, the family office of former Blackstone president Tony James, and the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX), which is working on a partial conversion to blockchain settlement using DA’s technology.      The stock exchange's participation in the round represents a vote of confidence in the startup following a steady contraction of the market for bespoke distributed ledger technology (DLT) and the loss of several high-profile staffers at DA.      “Unlike other enterprise blockchain projects, we haven't missed a deadline to date with ASX,” said Yuval Rooz, Digital Asset’s CEO, who succeeded Masters. Industry-wide testing of the new ASX system starts in Q1 of next year, a process which could take about a year, said Rooz.      The new funding round brings the total amount raised by Digital Asset since its establishment in 2014 to $150 million. For now, DA is not sharing the names of the new investors.      The company plans to use the proceeds to grow the community around its Digital Asset Modeling Language (DAML) and spread the technology to new platforms and across a broader range of industries.    A long and winding road    DA initially billed itself as a builder of private blockchains for banks and financial infrastructures, but shifted its focus to DAML, an open-source system for dealing with smart contracts. The protocol can run on top of a number of blockchain and non-DLT distributed architectures and has been integrated with Hyperledger Sawtooth, Hyperledger Fabric, Corda, Amazon’s QLDB and the cloud-native Aurora database.      Still, Rooz argues that the company kept close to its original mission.      “From my perspective, this is not a new direction. This is the right extension to what we have done,” he said “I don’t think there are many startups that haven’t changed direction at least once. Look at Slack - it started out as instant messaging for gamers.”      Rooz said the company would be hiring the applicable staff (the current headcount stands at roughly 140), but not any more than normal.      “I’m not saying because we have raised some funding we need to hire another 30 people or something,” he said. (Through a spokeswoman, he later added: “The funds raised by our series C will be used for hiring talent, enabling new integrations, community development and partner enablement.”      Rooz acknowledged the tough conditions in the enterprise blockchain market.      “I think there has been such a hype in the enterprise blockchain space and now some people cannot deliver on the hype,” Rooz said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/12/11/australias-stock-exchange-backs-35m-round-for-dlt-survivor-digital-asset,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cdab73a334b406f9f2314e3b63389735d21abcf0-450x450.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431269,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN1Flh,1576071000,"2019 Saw the End of Blockchain Tourism: Marie Wieck, IBM","This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Marie Wieck is general manager at IBM Blockchain, where she focuses on driving ecosystem growth around the Hyperledger Project and delivering enterprise blockchain solutions.      In 2019, blockchain’s initial hype has evolved into enterprise platforms driving real digital transformation. Today, real-world use cases for permissioned networks, administered by trusted parties, are yielding benefits in industries including finance, food, global trade and healthcare.      While entrepreneurs and businesses continue to propose novel blockchain concepts worth pursuing, blockchain is now ten years old, surely long enough to identify clear patterns about where it drives the most tangible business benefits. Indeed, we might even say that 2019 marked the end of blockchain tourism, a period when for many, blockchain pilots were less about critically examining and applying a new technology than they were about simply saying you had made the trip. We saw a shift from dabbling in blockchain for the sake of learning more about the technology for technology’s sake, to applying it to solve long-standing problems.      So far, IBM has helped clients launch more than 100 networks that are now in production. The best use cases, in our view, take advantage of the technology’s novel properties, including the ability to track provenance, an increasingly important issue to consumers. 75 percent of consumers said they would consider changing to a brand that offered more product information in 2018, according to a Food Marketing Institute survey, up from just 39 percent in 2016. After making provenance information available in store using IBM Food Trust, the French retailer Carrefour found that customers spent as long as 90 seconds reading it.      While hype surrounding crypto certainly helped drive consumer interest, funding, and innovation in the past, it has also perhaps overshadowed some of the hard business uses to which blockchain is uniquely suited. These advantages include immutability. Blockchain can readily digitize the paper processes once relied upon to share information up and down supply chains. In the longer term, the technology can even make it possible to exchange value between participants where an efficient market maker does not yet exist, for example with carbon credits or cross-border remittances, areas of commerce that have been devoid of clear rules and level playing fields for participants. In short, blockchain is best at tackling problems where there is a lack of traceability or a lack of digital economy.    We have seen many successful blockchain pilots, but unless network participants feel comfortable using it to collaborate and share data at scale, the advantages of distributed ledgers won’t materialize.    When these advantages have been exploited, blockchain-based businesses are already beginning to drive sales. Carrefour says it blockchain tracing system, which is accessible via consumer-facing QR codes, has boosted sales of some products. Through shared data, companies like Carrefour can engender greater trust and collaboration between customers, employees and partners.      Distributed ledgers present a dual challenge for companies, one that is arguably 20 percent technological and 80 percent governance. We have seen many successful blockchain pilots, but unless network participants feel comfortable using it to collaborate and share data at scale, the advantages of distributed ledgers won’t materialize.      2019 also offered a clear roadmap for how these governance models should be structured to ensure adoption and growth. These principles must allow for global identity standards that aren’t limited to a single network or country. They must require permissioned, trusted access in a way that centers privacy. There should also be blockchain registries like Hacera Unbounded – almost like network 'Yellow Pages’ – to identify the public entry points to enterprise networks, and participants must ensure open access to key data platforms via API.      When applied, these principles have made it possible to scale blockchain networks rapidly. TradeLens, a solution co-developed by IBM and Maersk to digitize the global shipping industry, became commercially available only in December 2018. But thanks to its open standards and governance structure, the platform has rapidly recruited dozens of ports, freight forwarders, customs offices and more. By July 2020 commitments from key global container operators will cover more than half of world’s container cargo.      While the age of blockchain tourism may be mercifully over, the digital transformation it enables is still only just getting underway. Now that we have a base of successful implementations, we can begin to shift our focus to standards surrounding integration and interoperability.      As we look ahead to 2020, key community efforts will help expand the business impact of blockchain. These include establishing trusted identity standards that apply across networks (and will also speed on-boarding and adoption, like those established by the Decentralized Identity Foundation and World Wide Web Consortium. Meanwhile, efforts like the Token Taxonomy Initiative are creating technical standards for the digitization of assets on blockchain data platforms. These complement the public and regulatory interest in new digital business models around asset-backed stablecoins and digital fiat currencies.      Once we have a shared version of the truth based on shared data and common standards, entirely new business models become possible for companies and individuals. And while this vision may take much longer to come to pass than one supply chain or finance platform, its end goal -- a truly circular, frictionless economy – will be greater than the sum of its parts.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Marie Wieck,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/12/11/2019-saw-the-end-of-blockchain-tourism-marie-wieck-ibm,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/53dd9480e77771c2d1564034dbb2a0d429321624-1178x920.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431257,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN1FNh,1576070548,"SEC Taking 'Measured' Approach to Digital Asset Regulation, Jay Clayton Tells Senate Committee","The chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Jay Clayton, says his agency is taking a ""measured"" regulatory stance on ""promising"" blockchain tech.      Giving testimony on the oversight of his agency before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs on Tuesday, Clayton honed in on its regulation of the crypto and blockchain space, saying the SEC has been dedicating ""a significant amount of attention and resources on digital assets.""      ""Overall, I believe we have taken a measured, yet proactive regulatory approach that both fosters innovation and capital formation while protecting our investors and our markets,"" he said.      Clayton also spelled out how it's been enforcing securities rules on digital asset firms that stray over the line.      ""This past year, the Commission has brought actions against a number of issuers of digital assets for allegedly engaging in fraud and for violating the registration provisions of the federal securities laws,"" he said. ""The Commission also filed charges related to the unlawful promotion of initial coin offerings (ICOs) and the unlawful operation of a digital asset trading platform.""      Also indirectly cited was the SEC's ongoing court action against Telegram.      The commission took ""emergency action to block an alleged unregistered, ongoing, public digital token offering in the United States that has raised more than $1.7 billion of investor funds,"" said the chairman.      While such enforcement actions are somewhat controversial in the crypto space, including another against Kik over its $100 million ICO, the SEC has also approved a number of initiatives it deems as falling within its rules.      For the first time, the SEC issued a “no-action” letter to TurnKey Jet, Inc. in April, agreeing that tokens used by the business-travel startup are not securities as long as the firm stays within certain conditions. Similarly, in October, the SEC granted Paxos Trust Company no-action relief to settle equity securities trades on a blockchain platform for broker-dealers.      In addition, last week the New York Digital Investment Group (NYDIG) secured approval from the regulator to offer institutional investors shares of a new fund focused on bitcoin futures.      The agency's long-term reluctance to approve any of a number of bitcoin exchange-traded fund proposals has been criticized by industry executives. However, the SEC is sticking to its view that bitcoin isn't yet mature enough to support an ETF.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2019/12/11/sec-taking-measured-approach-to-digital-asset-regulation-jay-clayton-tells-senate-committee,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/08ec5d5dd6098cec4ae9375113edc4fd8f9e7336-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431276,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN1Fxh,1576067400,This Year Proved Asia Is Ahead in Crypto-Blockchain Adoption,"This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Michael Ou is CEO of CoolBitX, a blockchain security company and creator of the first hardware wallet that enables bluetooth-to-smartphone pairings.      In 2019, it became clear that Asia was moving ahead in cryptocurrency and blockchain adoption and application. Because of internal and external drivers, Asia has been setting the pace in turning ideas in the blockchain space into reality.      Investors in China, Japan, and South Korea are being driven into crypto markets by global and regional trade wars, currency devaluation, and tight government control of individual assets. Global trading platform, eToro, has found consistent spikes in bitcoin activity during key moments of the US-China trade war.      In May, after China announced a tariff hike on $60 billion worth of American goods, and investors immediately moved to divest their wealth elsewhere. The number of new bitcoin positions soared 139% (along with a 108% rise in new gold positions). The increase in both new gold and bitcoin positions has been consistent as the trade war between both powers has continued — with bitcoin witnessing more significant benefits than the precious metal. It seems that amidst increasing uncertainty upon the global economic stage, bitcoin is reaping the benefits.      Additionally, in 2019, Chinese consumers were the greatest users of Tether—using the stablecoin to transfer their yuan across borders, free from government supervision and sanction. While the Chinese government doesn’t allow yuan trading on domestic exchanges, Tether has allowed Chinese consumers to partake in global cryptocurrency markets—with up to 99% of bitcoin spot trades conducted using Tether according to Chainalysis.      Established Markets: Where Fintech Innovation is Commonplace      Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore are established hubs for digital payments adoption and fintech innovation. In the first 9 months of this year alone, investments into Singaporean fintech companies exceeded $1 billion USD, with the Monetary Authority of Singapore stating that this was the result not only of local startup activity but also international fintech companies using Singapore is a base for global expansion.      China is perhaps the first country to be in a position to credibly claim “cashless” status. A 2017 Penguin Intelligence study has shown that 92% of inhabitants in China’s top cities use WeChat Pay or AliPay as their primary payment method. In addition to their prowess within the fintech space, the more traditional markets of Asia’s leading economies have been dubbed as the next bastion of economic growth globally, with the Financial Times predicting that by 2025 we will have entered into a new “Asian Century”. With regional fintech players dominating digital payments, one would question whether crypto can compete and find a foothold to demonstrate its use as a digital payments system.      Global instability has provided opportunities for alternative assets. The Chinese economy and the Yuan are continuing to trend downward amidst a trade war with the US. Hong Kong’s financial sector is suffering the consequences of increased political instability and security risks within the country. Hong Kong’s stock market was the world’s worst performer in Q3. Meanwhile, fraught relations between South Korea and North Korea, as well as Japan, are doing nothing to improve investor confidence in the capital markets, hurting the value of national currencies. With stability increasingly in question, traditional investors and institutions are looking at cryptocurrencies as a means to hedge their assets and diversify their portfolios, creating capital flows into the digital assets space, which has been largely insulated from the knock-on effects of regime instability and international trade conditions.      Emerging Economies: Growth Without Trust      Blockchain and cryptocurrency has a different sort of role in emerging economies, like Philippines and India, where trust in local institutions remains low and new systems and structures created in the crypto markets can bolster feeble financial infrastructures.    Crypto is offering tangible benefits within countries’ struggling to provide adequate services and solutions to consumers.    From the use of cryptocurrencies as a remittance tool—facilitating more convenient, secure, and transparent international payments than legacy payments systems—to interbank transactions, crypto-adoption is offering tangible benefits within countries’ struggling to provide adequate services and solutions to consumers. Far removed from the inefficiencies of local governments and financial apparatus, decentralized finance potentially provides a more stable, secure means of holding and transferring wealth.      2019: Regulating a Grassroots Movement      Singapore, one of the leading hubs for blockchain adoption, now boasts more than 400 fintech firms within the island nation, one for every 14,000 people living in the country. “Blockchain” is the fastest growing job skill in Singapore, and among the top 3 in China, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong and Vietnam, according to LinkedIn studies. While BTC and ETH continue to enjoy popularity within the region, altcoins like TRON and EOS have special status in Asia. With all of this activity, the region’s regulators have been paying attention. This has resulted in much regulatory proactivity—with countries from Malaysia and Singapore to Japan and South Korea having unveiled comprehensive guidelines for the issuance and purchase of digital assets, while other regions have lagged behind. This may well signal more things to come in the year ahead.      Big companies like Facebook entered the crypto space this year, but there is still a long way for them to go in drawing large consumer-tech firms into the cryptocurrency fold. Mature businesses and institutions are unlikely to enter into the nascent crypto sector if they believe they are rolling the dice on regulatory compliance. Enticing them into the blockchain ecosystem will require clear regulation. Asia is where they may be able to find it.      The region’s regulators have become the forerunners in establishing clear “rules of the game” when it comes to digital assets, engaging closely with groups such as the Financial Action Task Force and key industry players. While the U.S. continues to grapple with the regulation of digital assets, Singapore, Japan, and South Korea, and particularly within the island of Jeju, have outlined more comprehensive regulatory boundaries for actors within the blockchain industry. While China has taken a heavy-handed regulatory approach, the government has been nonetheless consistent and clear in the communication of policies surrounding the blockchain sector. This clarity leaves Asia’s regional blockchain sector well-positioned to serve as a vanguard for the development of real-world use cases of cryptocurrency technology and as a leader in consumer engagement.      2020: Cryptocurrencies Coming of Age?      In 2019, Asia became a testing bed for cryptocurrency adoption, presenting real use cases of cryptocurrencies in both highly developed and emerging markets. Pervasive economic tensions, structural instability, and downward market pressures may prove the headwinds necessary for cryptocurrency to finally enter the mainstream.      In 2020, FATF members need to ensure virtual asset service providers (VASPs) are compliant to Recommendation 16 aka the “travel rule” by a September deadline, and regulators, looking to maintain control over local finance and consumer technology, will look to bring in institutional finance and enterprise to the space. If this is the case, the crypto heartland of tomorrow will lie in Asia. We are prepared, and excited to see what the future will bring.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET,Michael Ou,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/12/11/this-year-proved-asia-is-ahead-in-crypto-blockchain-adoption,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cfa1567d94a384a4ebd7590e4236fc0ecaa6f348-1500x712.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431260,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN1FVh,1576066927,Bitcoin Is Closing on Historically Strong Price Support,"View  Bitcoin may soon see solid support from the 21-month exponential moving average (currently at $7,097).  Repeated defense of the EMA could attract technical buying. The average had acted as strong support in the five months to October 2018.  A UTC close above $7,870 is needed to confirm a short-term bullish reversal.  A violation at the EMA support could yield a re-test of recent lows near $6,500.    Bitcoin is still feeling bearish pressure and could soon drop to historically strong price support below $7,100.      The cryptocurrency fell 1.7 percent on Tuesday, reinforcing the bearish view put forward by the strong rejection above $7,600 witnessed over the weekend.      The longer term picture is also looking bleak. Bitcoin is currently down 48 percent from the June high of $13,880 and is reporting nearly a 13 percent drop on a quarter-to-date basis, according to Bitstamp data.      With the sellers in control, bitcoin looks set to re-test the 21-month exponential moving average (EMA), currently at $7,097. The EMA had acted as strong support in the five months to October 2018, as seen below.    Monthly chart (2017-2018)      Bitcoin’s sell-off from the record high of $20,000 reached in December 2017 ran out of steam at the 21-month EMA support in June 2018.      In the following four months, sellers repeatedly failed to secure a monthly close below the average line. By mid-October, many were convinced that the cryptocurrency had bottomed out along the key level.      Buyers, however, remained elusive and the average support, then located around $6,100, was convincingly breached in mid-November with high volumes. The violation of the support likely triggered stops on long positions, leading to a violent sell-off.      Clearly, the 21-month EMA, currently at $7,097, is the level to watch out for in the near-term – more so, as the bears have recently struggled to breach the support.    Monthly chart (2019)    The long-tail attached to October’s candle indicates sellers faded near the 21-month EMA line.      Prices did print lows below the crucial support last month, but the support remained intact on a monthly closing basis (Nov. 30, UTC).      December’s candle has already briefly defended the support. A week ago, the technical line held ground resulting in a price bounce that fizzled out at highs above $7,660 on Dec. 9.      If the EMA continues to restrict losses, chart-driven buying could be seen, leading to a notable price bounce.      That said, the short-term outlook will turn bullish only above $7,870. At press time, bitcoin is changing hands at $7,200 on Bitstamp.    Daily and weekly chart    A UTC close above the Nov. 29 high of $7,870 would invalidate the lower-highs setup on the daily chart (above left) and confirm a short-term bullish reversal.      However, the odds are currently stacked in favor of a move lower, as suggested by Monday’s ""outside day"" candle and Tuesday’s bearish follow-through.      A break below the 21-month EMA support at $7, 097 will likely yield a decline to recent lows near $6,500.      The long-term outlook would turn bullish if and when the cryptocurrency witnesses a falling channel breakout on the weekly chart.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/12/11/bitcoin-is-closing-on-historically-strong-price-support,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/29708dd8b135e3ce699b6cabbb23e222f70c6e34-1500x900.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431274,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN1Fth,1576065600,Here's a New Banking Tool for Vetting Crypto Exchanges,"A risk-based approach rather than a blanket ban on crypto activity – that’s what blockchain forensics startup Elliptic is hoping to engender among banks with its latest offering.       “Most banks at the moment have a zero-tolerance approach to crypto,” said Tom Robinson, Elliptic’s chief scientist and co-founder. “They don’t have any visibility into the risks that a particular exchange may possess. They all look the same to them. So, many of them won’t bank any exchanges.”      The product, called Elliptic Discovery, aims to give institutions up-to-date risk profiles of more than 200 of the largest exchanges globally.      Robinson says Elliptic’s tool offers risk indicators that matter to bankers:     An exchange's know-your-customer and anti-money laundering policies  Jurisdictions that an exchange operates under and what licenses it holds  The coins listed at the exchange that might be risky (i.e. privacy coins)  Analysis of an exchange's transactions (i.e. funds going to anonymizing services or funds going to entities/countries on a sanctions list)    Similar banking products in the market include TRM Labs’ risk-score for cryptocurrency transactions, with the startup analyzing more than a dozen blockchains for banks looking to fight money-laundering and fraud in the crypto sphere. Banks have also used Chainalysis’ transaction-monitoring tools to be able to compliantly work with crypto firms.      Elliptic’s Robinson said he spoke with about a dozen bankers to determine what risk indicators would be valuable to them. One insight gained from his informal survey was that bankers would be more likely to bank exchanges if they had more information about their risk profiles, he said.      The co-founder wouldn’t reveal the banks he contacted but Elliptic has publicly worked with crypto-friendly Silvergate Bank since the spring of 2017.      Robinson believes banks are missing out on business opportunities to add clients and working against the will of their retail customers that are likely already purchasing and trading crypto without their bank’s knowledge.      “I do think this is going to have a positive impact on the whole crypto system,” Robinson said.      Last month, Elliptic began providing anti-money laundering services to the Zilliqa blockchain and cryptocurrency. In September, Elliptic closed a $23 million Series B funding round led by Japanese financial company SBI Holdings, which will help Elliptic expand in Asia.

According to a report from Chinese business publication Caijing on Wednesday, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) has announced Yao's appointment on its internal bulletin.      The markets had anticipated Yao's hiring due to his contribution to the development of the People's Bank of China's central bank digital currency (CBDC) and deep understanding of financial technologies, especially blockchain, Caijing said.

42431263,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN1FZh,1576054800,Is Greece Cracking Down on Tax Evasion or Taxing Anonymity?,"Greece's plan to curb tax evasion by mandating digital receipts shows a fundamental dilemma of modernization: Economic policies rarely address corruption without sacrificing civil liberties.      The Greek prime minister’s chief economic adviser, Alex Patelis, told The Telegraph on Sunday that in 2020 Greek citizens will need to produce digital receipts for spending 30 percent of their annual income. Citizens who fall short of this documentation requirement – for example, only having credit card purchases and bank transfers for 20 percent of their income – will be fined with a 22 percent tax on the remaining amount (the remaining 10 percent, in this example).      When it comes to Greece, this drastic policy shows nation-states can mandate that citizens rely on banks. Credit cards and bank transfers – and their incumbent surveillance features – are no longer payment options for Greek citizens, they are obligations. And while bitcoin experts say cryptocurrency likely won’t be much help in this situation, they have been quick to pick up on the policy’s broad implications.      “I’ve never heard of anything like this before. It’s the most aggressive move to eradicate cash that I’ve seen in any country,” said British-Greek bitcoin advocate Andreas Antonopoulos, who grew up in Greece and still has family there.      However, economist Nicholas Economides, whose previous advisory clients include the Bank of Greece in 1993, disagreed that this policy represents a dramatic shift. To the contrary, Economides said, the Greek government has required digital receipts for tax deductibles for more than five years. If citizens are unable to show bank records or credit card statements for deductible bills, paper receipts no longer suffice. As such, he argued this is merely another modernization push.      “When you have widespread cheating, there has to be a way to make people stop cheating, to pay [taxes]. One way might be this extensive banking surveillance,” Economides said.      This policy aims to curb tax evasion. But, ironically, the middle class appears to be the most frequent taxpayers. Local media reports indicate that 5 percent of Greek taxpayers earning between €24,000 and €100,000 are paying half of all income-tax revenue. Basically, the remaining 95 percent pay as much as the above-mentioned 5 percent, implying the vast majority of citizens don’t pay their full income taxes.      “The violence of this law will impact all people, mainly our parents who are not familiar with... e-banking services,” Athens resident and bitcoin enthusiast Argy Xafis said. “My privacy is also invaded.""      Economides said he hopes the government will make exceptions for the elderly, but added this mandate may not impact the unbanked poor, as citizens below the poverty line don’t pay income taxes.      “People who don’t have debt or credit cards may have a hard time,” he said. “The government should create exceptions for people who don’t have such financial instruments.”    Cash Economy    From Economides’ perspective, tax evasion is a widespread cultural norm in Greece, across income levels.      Yet Georgios Konstantopoulos, an independent cryptocurrency consultant from Greece, said tax evasion isn’t the primary reason so many Greeks rely on cash for their daily transactions.      Konstantopoulos said it’s common for local businesses to offer a different price in cash compared to a transaction with an official receipt, even among hospitals, courts and other heavily regulated entities. Antonopoulos agreed cash bribery is the standard local practice.      “Every single medical procedure that is supposedly covered by the national healthcare in Greece involves a cash envelope,” Antonopoulos said. “You go into any hospital in Greece and they give you a blank envelope at the reception.”      As such, Konstantopoulos said this new policy will be difficult to enforce for waiters, construction workers and other laborers who generally rely on day-to-day cash payments – unless these low-income workers pay their rent with a bank card.      “The people who earn €500 a month, of course, will tax-evade because otherwise they cannot survive,” Konstantopoulos said. “Literally every young person who wants to do things in their life is looking for ways to work abroad. ...Generally, salaries suck; there are high taxes and fixed fees, pension or insurance, so a lot of shops and restaurants tend to have employees who work 'undeclared,’ paid daily in cash.”      Antonopoulos said this policy will make it more difficult for middle-class households and business owners to pay such workers in cash, since the culture of bribery won’t “disappear” overnight. Instead of jeopardizing healthcare and legal services, Antonopoulos said, the policy may push low-income workers into poverty and food insecurity because their services will be seen as comparably expendable.      “Pretty much every Greek I know who has even the slightest means to travel has a bank account in Germany,” Antonopoulos said, referring to how many Greeks skew their income reports and banking limitations. “It’s all for show. [This policy] is not a meaningful effort to curb tax evasion.”    Bitcoin doesn't fix this  Stepping back, the cash-centric Greek “shadow economy” reportedly accounts for more than 21 percenthttps://www.thenationalherald.com/173844/greek-shadow-economy-market-worst-eu-costly/ of the nation’s total GDP, according to a 2017 study by the Institute for Applied Economic Research.    The government previously curbed the cash economy by limited bank ATM withdrawals, a policy that started with a €60 ($70) daily limit in 2015 and finally lifted for domestic withdrawals in 2018. According to CNN, Greek bitcoin trades shot up when the banking restrictions first when into effect in 2015. Yet Konstantopoulos said the domestic bitcoin scene hasn’t surged since then to facilitate significant volumes. Antonopoulos agreed, describing the Greek bitcoin community as “small,” “isolated” and “risk-averse,” because people with the resources to buy bitcoin generally prefer foreign bank accounts.      “This isn’t about surveillance, this is about pushing people into poverty,” Antonopoulos said, explaining his criticism of the new tax policy.      According to an academic working group paper last revised in 2016, Greek professionals from industries such as law, medicine and media were most likely to be involved in tax evasion. As such, Antonopoulos said banking limitations primarily impact the middle class, because households with expendable income simply use foreign bank accounts instead.      It’s hard to say definitively how many Greeks are misrepresenting their taxable income because statistics are further skewed by the high percentage of self-employed and unemployed Greeks, each respectively estimated to represent over a third of the nation’s prospective workers. There is a popular perception that government corruption contributes to such economic woes, even without studies to quantify that impact. The nonprofit Transparency International gave Greece a failing integrity grade of 45 percent for “perceived levels of public sector corruption” in 2018.      Despite bitcoiners’ distrust of the government, Greek policies aren’t uniquely draconian. Reuters reported in August 2019, the central bank removed the €4,000 daily withdrawal limit for Greek citizens abroad as well. Furthermore, the Mediterranean nation is hardly the first to use banking surveillance to try to curb tax evasion. India conducted a comparable measure in 2016 through demonetization, forcing citizens to swap old bills for fresh ones in order to curb black-market dealings.      Whether these measures work is a different question altogether. Two years after demonetization, The Hindu reported tax revenue increases were on-par with previous years of economic growth, indicating the measure may not have been worth the hassle.      In support of Antonopoulos’ concern, economist Kaushik Basu wrote that Indian demonetization hurt low-income workers and small business owners while hardly inconveniencing the bulk of tax evaders, who hold assets in “gold and silver, real estate and overseas bank accounts.”      Generally speaking, tax evasion appears to be a social issue that economic policies alone fail to impact at scale.      “The people who are conducting the egregious tax evasion are in the government,” Antonopoulos said. “The hypocrisy of pushing measures through like this ... by people who know they’ll just switch to using their German bank accounts, is just disgusting.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2019/12/11/is-greece-cracking-down-on-tax-evasion-or-taxing-anonymity,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f165760999e1c6af8e5a5557f33635f2a3e1ec72-1920x1277.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The “Napoleon Bitcoin Fund” began trading on Dec. 6 with a minimum €100,000 ($110,000) buy-in for professional investors, who must reside in France, according to the prospectus. It can not be traded cross-border.      It is the first bitcoin fund released by Napoleon AM, the asset management wing of French financial services firm Napoleon Group. Napoleon AM became a licensed “Alternative Investment Fund Manager” in May 2019, the French financial regulator’s website shows.      And it’s also one of the first French funds to make novel use of CME’s cash-settled Bitcoin futures. The fund seeks exposure to bitcoin price movements without holding any actual bitcoin, according to the prospectus.      To that end, it trades CME bitcoin futures, the United States’ only regulated cash-settled bitcoin futures products (CME competitor Bakkt launched its own cash-settled bitcoin futures product in Singapore on Monday).      Napoleon could conceivably tap into Bakkt’s new product; the prospectus and investor factsheet leave open the possibility of including “similar[ly] organized exchange listing cash-settled BTC futures” going forward.      “We have opened the door for alternative use of futures in order to optimize replication and maintain access to the best sources in the future,” said Napoleon AM’s Communications Director Sergio Gonzalez.      Stéphane Ifrah, President of Napoleon AM, said in a press statement that the fund “is the culmination of discussions with the [French] regulator.”      “We are proud to contribute to the institutionalization and democratization of digital assets through a unique regulated fund under French law.""      It remains to be seen how popular an investment vehicle tied to bitcoin futures will be with French investors.      Their U.S. counterparts have shown some interest in regulated futures products, with the CME recently reporting a 61% year-over-year increase in its bitcoin futures' open contracts.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/12/11/frances-new-napoleon-bitcoin-fund-is-tied-to-cmes-cash-settled-futures,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3bf99c4d93e3251062de538678a8f716eb6d3524-1200x798.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42431259,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN1FRh,1576022406,Ripple's Revamped Xpring Platform Looks to Boost XRP Development,"Ripple has condensed its broad Xpring developer platform into a single site.      The new platform aims to allow crypto and non-crypto developers to integrate payments into any mobile application. Now, Xpring.io offers those developers a wallet, new tools, technical documentation and Xrping customer service.      The new platform was announced in October, though the company needed two months to build features which allows users to have an account associated with the platform, said Ethan Beard, senior vice president of Xpring.      “That will be the central hub for developers to manage everything they need when it comes to integrating payments into their apps,” Beard said.      Xpring claims that the platform’s Software Development Kit (SDK) takes 100 lines of code and condenses it to 21 lines. The platform is a new vertical for Xpring, which has acted as an investment arm for Ripple for more than a year, with the goal of building a network of companies and use-cases around XRP. The initiative is aimed at investing in and growing a developer base around the cryptocurrency.      With the wallet, which is currently available on XRP Testnet, developers can generate and manage account credentials, view balances, send and receive cryptocurrency and monitor transaction history. Developers can also expect to see future new Xpring platform functions launched on the wallet in the future, Beard said.      “Before it was quite complicated. It was done through command line or piecing together a variety of different tools,” Beard said. “There’s a reason why people keep a lot of their cryptocurrency inside hosted wallets on exchanges because all of that is obfuscated.”      The Xpring SDK now supports reliable transaction submission on XRP devnet and testnet, making it easier for developers to submit and verify transactions on XRP ledger. The kit now also supports Python and Go in its suite of programming languages, which already includes Java, JavaScript and Swift.      XRP ledger validators have also voted to give developers access to XRP ledger stable version 1.4.0, which supports accounts that can be deleted and allow users to recover up to 15 XRP of their minimum account balance. Previously users had to have a balance of 20 XRP held on the ledger, which users couldn’t move or use.",POSITIVE,XRP,REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | WALLET | XRP,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/12/11/ripples-revamped-xpring-platform-looks-to-boost-xrp-development,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4063eb9e8104e8ed1fe4ff4a68653b761d188149-2560x1440.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
