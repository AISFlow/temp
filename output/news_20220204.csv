The new cooling technology can reduce heat, power consumption and noise, as well as extend the lifespan of the machines.  California-based Merkle has signed a deal with Bitmain, one of the world’s largest bitcoin mining rig manufacturers, to get a shipment of 4,449 of the newest mining computers in May, and expects the machines to add about 840 petahash per second (PH/s) of mining power to the company, according to a statement shared exclusively with CoinDesk.  The S19 Pro+ Hydro miners were unveiled on Jan. 17, and have the most mining power among Bitmain’s current offering of specialized bitcoin mining rigs known as ASICs.  “This order is a major milestone in the exponential growth of Merkle Standard and our partnership with Bitmain signifies our mission to develop sustainable and efficient operations, prioritizing the acquisition of high performing machines and embracing the latest technologies manufactured by our strategic partner Bitmain,” said Ruslan Zinurov, CEO of Merkle Standard in a statement.  Merkle previously said on Jan. 21 that it had executed a purchase agreement with Bitmain for 13,500 ASIC miners, consisting of both S19 XP and S19J Pro mining rigs.  Merkle will deploy all the Bitmain miners at its flagship data center in Eastern Washington, which has 225 megawatt (MW) capacity, with potential expansion capabilities up to 500 MW. The miner expects to be net carbon negative and reach 4.6 exahash per second (EH/s) of mining power by the end of this year.

42396091,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT0ilV,1644009623,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Rallies as Altcoins Take the Lead,"Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies rallied on Friday, reversing losses from a few days ago. Alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) outperformed as ether (ETH), the world's second-largest cryptocurrency, gained 13% over the past 24 hours compared with an 11% rise in BTC.  NEAR, the token associated with Near Protocol, a layer one blockchain that aims to overcome the limitations of its competitors including slow transaction rates, surged as much as 20% in the past 24 hours. The rise in altcoins relative to bitcoin could reflect a greater appetite for risk among crypto investors.  ""Since late last year, there has been a continuing trend that even bitcoin's calming is enough for altcoins to return to growth and outperform the first cryptocurrency,"" Alex Kuptsikevich, an analyst at FxPro, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  Technical indicators point to additional price gains for bitcoin if buyers are able to maintain support above $37,000 over the weekend. Further, a decisive move above $40,000 could signal the start of a recovery phase.  Over the past few weeks, several indicators such as the bitcoin Fear & Greed Index, relative strength index (RSI) and a six-month high in the bitcoin options put/call ratio signaled bearish extremes in the crypto market. Some analysts expect crypto buyers to return, similar to what occurred after the July 2020 price bottom at $28,000 BTC.  Latest prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $40569, +11.34%    ●Ether (ETH): $2955, +14.17%    ●S&P 500 daily close: $4501, +0.52%    ●Gold: $1808 per troy ounce, +0.12%    ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 1.93%     Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time. Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Short liquidations rise  Friday's crypto rally forced many short sellers to liquidate positions.  Liquidations occur when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position as a safety mechanism due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. That happens primarily in futures trading.  Ether traders, who reacted to a larger price jump, exited short positions in greater numbers than bitcoin traders over the past 24 hours. While the chart below does not indicate an extreme short squeeze, the steady decline in long liquidations since Jan. 20 crash could mean that selling pressure is starting to fade.  ""Much of the momentum is likely due to $160 million of combined short liquidations for BTC and ETH over the past 24 hours,"" FundStrat wrote in a Friday note. That means large liquidations are partly responsible for accelerated price movements in the crypto spot market.  Entering the value zone  For now, traders are keeping a close eye on nearby resistance levels in BTC and ETH. A sustained rise in trading volume over the weekend could encourage more buying activity.  ""An essential boundary for ether will be the $3K mark. A return in the price above this level could further encourage buyers and reject the idea of a crypto winter following the example of 2018,"" Kuptsikevich wrote.  And for bitcoin, some analysts are monitoring the cryptocurrency's market-value-to-realized-value ratio (MVRV), which compares the aggregate cost basis of BTC holders relative to the current market value. It is essentially a ""fair value"" metric.  The ""MVRV ratio is currently hovering around 1.5, which does leave some room for it to fall further. Historical lows around ~0.75-1.0 have typically served as solid long-term entry points, though MVRV has fallen to the same level we saw last summer before BTC reversed course and broke to new [all-time highs],"" Delphi Digital wrote in a blog post.  Still, like many indicators, MVRV is not a precise buy/sell signal. Some analysts prefer to see MVRV rise above deep value levels to confirm a price recovery.  Altcoin roundup  Choppy trading in metaverse tokens: Metaverse-related tokens took a hit in the past two days as Meta, formerly known as Facebook, reported a $10 billion loss on its augmented and virtual reality division in an earnings release earlier this week. That setback will directly impact the market perception of other metaverses, a developer said. Tokens of blockchain-based games Axie Infinity (AXS), The Sandbox (SAND) and Gala (GALA) fell as much as 12% in the past 24 hours, although losses were quickly retraced as the crypto market rallied later in the North American trading day.  DeFi skepticism: “From what we can tell, most DeFi lending is simply over-collateralized crypto loans to other holders of crypto so that the latter can either (a) buy more crypto or (b) obtain liquidity against appreciated crypto holdings without incurring capital gains taxes. Either way, it does not appear to be the kind of lending activity that could survive a large sustained decline in crypto prices themselves,” Michael Cembalest, JPMorgan Asset and Wealth Management’s chairman of market and investment strategy, wrote in a report.

Day traders unhappy with India crypto tax: Aditya Singh, a co-founder of Crypto India, said 1% TDS is too much, and with enough trades, an entity's initial account capital would be significantly depleted.

The regulator also flagged its concerns about the liquidity and transparency of bitcoin markets, as well as the “suitability” of bitcoin as the underlying asset for the fund. Grayscale is a unit of Digital Currency Group, which is also the parent of CoinDesk.  The SEC has asked the public to comment on these issues, and given them 21 days to do so, with an additional 14 days for responses to those comments.  Earlier this week, the SEC requested investment manager Bitwise to respond to similar concerns about its own spot bitcoin ETF proposal.  Grayscale initially filed an application with the SEC to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into a bitcoin spot ETF in October. In December, the SEC pushed off its review of Grayscale's application by 45 days.  Over the past couple of months, the agency has rejected spot bitcoin ETF applications from WisdomTree, Krypton, SkyBridge and Fidelity.

The funding round included $60 million of primary capital and $20 million from secondary investors. The funds will help fuel growth, which includes potential acquisitions, further development of retail investor offerings and geographic expansion.  Coinbase, Avalanche and Terra participated through strategic investments.  Other investors in the round included Kingsway Capital, HOF Capital, Raptor Group and GoldenTree Asset Management.  Qredo has now raised $120 million in the past year, including a seed round in May 2021 and a private token sale last June.  Qredo offers a layer 2 protocol that enables instant cross-chain swaps and settlement on supported blockchains, all at a lower cost than layer 1 transactions.  Qredo uses decentralized multi-party computation (MPC), a cryptographic tool that eliminates the need for individual keys, a security weak point, by allowing multiple computers to share private data representing a piece of the key.  “Infrastructure is a key battleground for scaling crypto adoption,” 10T founder and CEO Dan Tapiero said in the press release. “Qredo’s distributed architecture and unique implementation of MPC is a game-changer for the secure custody and settlement of crypto assets.”  Last October, Qredo was named among four blockchain technology companies tapped by Banco Hipotecario de El Salvador, one of the country’s four state-owned banks, to help the El Salvador adapt bitcoin as a legal tender.

42396082,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT0iga,1644004821,US Treasury Department Warns of NFT Risk in Art-Related Money Laundering,"The U.S. Department of the Treasury warned that non-fungible tokens (NFT) may become a tool for money laundering in the high-value art market in a study published Friday.  The 40-page report, published in accordance with the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020, found there is some evidence to suggest high-value art is involved in money laundering, but likely not in any terrorist financing. However, the document did suggest NFTs could be used to facilitate more illicit transactions in the art market.  ""The emerging digital art market, such as the use of non-fungible tokens (NFT), may present new risks, depending on the structure and market incentives,"" a press release said.  Art is relatively easy to transport and the art market has a ""long-standing culture of privacy"" that can enable easily manipulated prices, making high-value art vulnerable to money laundering, the report said.  Different pieces of artwork have already been used to cover up the transfer or holding of funds acquired illicitly, the report said, pointing to the 1MDB scandal as one example.  NFTs and the broader, growing digital art sector can present new money laundering issues.  Read more: New Chainalysis Report Suggests NFT Crime Doesn’t (Always) Pay  ""Recent sales of high-profile pieces of physical and digital art involving NFTs, including NFT-authenticated works such as Beeple’s 'Everydays: The First 5000 Days,' which sold at a Christie’s auction for more than $69 million, indicate that this nascent art sector has reached similar valuations as traditional art mediums,"" the document said.  The NFT market saw $1.5 billion in trading in the first quarter of 2021, compared to the $20 billion seen by the U.S. art market through all of 2020. Still, the report noted that legitimate auction houses and art dealers ""are increasingly offering NFTs,"" and highlighted the growth of platforms such as Dapper Labs, OpenSea and SuperRare.  These platforms might be considered virtual asset service providers (VASP) by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and therefore be subject to existing know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) laws.  The report also warned of the possibility of wash trading with NFTs.  ""Furthermore, NFTs can be used to conduct self-laundering, where criminals may purchase an NFT with illicit funds and proceed to transact with themselves to create records of sales on the blockchain,"" the report said. ""The NFT could then be sold to an unwitting individual who would compensate the criminal with clean funds not tied to a prior crime.""  The report went on to say that some transactions may not be recorded on a public ledger, or could otherwise bypass any regulators or investigators watching for illicit funds.  Smart contracts designed to automatically ensure the original artist receives royalty payments every time the NFT is sold could inadvertently encourage transactions that avoid the regulatory net, the document said.  ""These types of contracts can create an incentive to shape a marketplace where the work is traded repeatedly in a short period,"" the report said. ""While this can ensure that artists are compensated for their work past the first sale, the activity can pose [money laundering] vulnerabilities because the incentive to transact can potentially be higher than the incentive to verify the identity of the buyer of the work, or even can create a situation where it is not possible to conduct due diligence if transactions are conducted in rapid succession.""  What's more, auction houses may not be able to keep up with these transactions or verify buyer identities due to a lack of technical wherewithal, the report said.  The report recommended that the Treasury Department weigh the costs and benefits of applying anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing rules to art market participants, including possible customer identification and suspicious activity report rules.  No NFT-specific recommendations were made. While the report identified potential vulnerabilities, it noted that entities of different sizes would have different levels of risk.  The report said the Treasury Department should consider whether it should have a transaction or sales volume threshold for reporting requirements, whether it should enact AML rules in compliance with international standards and whether high-value art should have different rules than lower-value transactions.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | REGULATION | SPONSORED | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/02/04/us-treasury-department-warns-of-nft-risk-in-art-related-money-laundering,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8679a3145c32a9eb89ebc4064d5a8b20adc20180-4500x3001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Upside momentum is improving after technical indicators reached the most oversold levels since March 2020.  BTC was trading around $40,500 at press time and is up 10% over the past 24 hours.  Buyers will need to make a decisive move above $40,000 in order to reverse the price downtrend since the November peak around $69,000. Over the past few months, brief rallies have been capped below resistance levels, which means sellers have been in control.  Over the short term, however, bitcoin could see additional upside, especially since the relative strength index (RSI) is not overbought on the daily chart.

42416758,e264UAkMOkEShzxWulY94m,1644002255,Nike and Hermès File Lawsuits for Trademark Infringement as Fashion Collides With NFTs,"Imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery, but not when it comes to the increasingly lucrative market of digital collectibles. Determining what crosses the line into wrongful conduct can be a tricky matter, as two separate legal actions may show.  Nike (NKE) is the latest to file a lawsuit, accusing online sneaker reseller StockX of selling unauthorized images of its shoes in the form of non-fungible tokens (NFT).  In the lawsuit filed Friday, Nike accuses StockX of minting and marketing NFTs containing trademarked material without authorization or approval. Nike wants to block further sales and is asking for unspecified monetary damages.  In a funding round led by Altimeter Capital in April, StockX raised $255 million at a $3.8 billion valuation, which might come in handy in its legal fight.  Another high-profile case involves the French luxury designer brand Hermès, which filed suit against Mason Rothschild on Wednesday after it created NFTs of Hermes' famous Birkin handbags, called “MetaBirkins.” For the moment, the MetaBirkin NFTs have been removed from the OpenSea marketplace after Hermès served Rothschild with a cease-and-desist letter, reports The Fashion Law.  With the recent trend of luxury fashion brands launching NFTs expected to gain momentum through 2022, so will the heavy scrutiny on NFTs imitating those brands. Of the StockX case in particular, Trace Schmeltz, co-chair of the Fintech Practice Group at law firm Barnes & Thornburg, expects the company to respond to the Nike suit by claiming “fair use” because each NFT sold is just a digital version of the physical shoes purchased by customers.  Speaking more generally about the idea that artists might seek First Amendment protection in the U.S., Schmeltz says artists need to establish that what they are doing is, in fact, art. “To say that your work is protected as art, like [Andy] Warhol’s use of the Campbell’s Soup label, misses the fact that the First Amendment gives less protection to commercial speech, particularly when it infringes on intellectual property rights.”  Read more: What Are NFTs and How Do They Work?",NEUTRAL,없음,MARKET | REGULATION,Tanzeel Akhtar,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/02/04/nike-and-hermes-sue-for-trademark-infringement-as-fashion-collides-with-nfts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/41d511a6a0e70041e979db1af90689e97eb56e88-640x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394319,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvbWaR,1644001813,India's Tough Crypto Stance Has a Silver Lining,"When the Indian government this week announced plans to tax cryptocurrency and launch a central bank digital currency, the news drew a mixed response. Some in the Indian crypto community gave it a glass-half-full reading while others reported their drinking vessels as half empty.  The former were relieved Narendra Modi’s government didn’t ban cryptocurrencies, as was previously threatened. The latter were angered they’d now have to shave 30% off each crypto trading profit they make.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Both missed the bigger picture, one that goes beyond India to the wider world. That is, in betting on a digital monetary future, the financial authorities of the world’s second-most populous nation are joining those of other nations to hasten the arrival of a multi-currency international monetary system – whether they want that outcome or not. In that world, cryptocurrencies will inevitably occupy a key place.  There are important messages here for the U.S. government, the steward of the current, mono-currency international monetary system, which, according to a report in Barron’s last week, is viewing the need for new crypto regulations as a “matter of national security.”  How the U.S. approaches this national security issue will be key. With an openness that encourages a global free market model of financial innovation? Or with a defensive posture aimed at protecting the existing centralized system and the dollar’s reserve status? It’s hard to overstate how much rests on that choice.  Taxation vs. legitimacy  First, let’s acknowledge that India’s move imposing taxation on cryptocurrencies and postponing a more detailed regulatory step that could yet include some kind of prohibition, is less than ideal for the domestic crypto industry’s short-term outlook.  Policy 4.0 founder Tanvi Ratna tweeted that “taxation does not imply legality” because even illegal transactions are taxed in India.  Still, there was no real hostility in the statement from Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, who spoke only of “a phenomenal increase in transactions in virtual digital assets,” which “made it imperative to provide for a specific tax regime.”  Regardless, moves to tax an activity are often seen as de facto legitimation of that activity. (It was one reason I took my own glass-half-full reading of last year’s battle over the crypto provision in the U.S. infrastructure bill.) So, on balance, it seems crypto has a moderately clearer pathway to adoption in India. That pathway will be laid, in part, by the other development to emerge from Sitharaman’s announcement: plans for a central bank digital currency (CBDC).  CBDCs as crypto’s adrenaline boost  It’s fair to assume the Indian government, like China’s, believes developing a CBDC will curtail the expansion of decentralized cryptos such as bitcoin. There is already overwhelmingly greater demand for national currencies such as theirs, the thinking goes, so making those government monies digital will neutralize the only appealing competitive advantage of non-national digital currencies.  This is flawed zero-sum thinking. It assumes there’s some fixed pie of demand for currencies, and when usage of one currency rises the amount tapped by the other must fall. It fails to foresee the second-round effects that a rush to CBDCs will have on the wider crypto ecosystem.  How will CBDCs boost crypto?  First, once digital fiat bearer instruments, be they CBDCs or stablecoins, are used for payments inside other blockchain-based services such as supply chain management, gaming or non-fungible tokens (NFT), it will boost that wider crypto ecosystem – the decentralized metaverse of Web 3 – as it goes mainstream.  This will, in turn, generate demand for the cryptocurrencies and other native crypto tokens that decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web 3 services require for governance. If a CBDC fund infusion boosts demand for NFTs, for example, there will be more smart contract transactions on platforms such as Ethereum or Solana, which will then drive demand for ETH and SOL.  The second factor is that once they are entrenched globally, CBDCs could challenge the supremacy of the dollar. However that plays out, it’s hard to see how cryptocurrencies lose.  The dollar’s end or a golden age?  The programmable nature of CBDCs will allow for direct, atomic settlement between holders of two different countries’ currencies, which will negate the need for an intermediating reserve currency in international trade deals. Some central banks, such as China’s, Singapore’s, Thailand’s and that of the United Arab Emirates, are already experimenting with direct interoperability between their respective CBDCs.  The endgame here is the eventual disruption of the SWIFT network for international currency settlement, a system that is built around the centrality of the dollar and of U.S. financial institutions’ prime role as international correspondent banks. Its demise will, in turn, reduce demand for the dollar and diminish the international influence of Wall Street, which will curb Washington’s ability to harness the U.S. currency’s exorbitant privilege to police other countries’ transactions and secure cheap foreign financing for Americans’ consumption habits.  In response, the U.S. has two options.  First, it could do nothing, hoping the existing dollar-centric international monetary system persists by weight of its own dominance. (Or it could do something that is effectively nothing, such as having the Federal Reserve issue its own CBDC and embedding the existing Wall Street-dominated banking model.)  In this scenario, the dollar will fall from its pedestal. But it won’t be supplanted by China’s digital yuan, or another country’s currency for that matter. The world will no longer have a single reserve currency but many digital currencies competing against each other.  It’s a more financially uncertain environment, one where governments are more likely to go rogue and engage in currency wars – or worse, physical wars – generating economic, political and social instability. If so, demand for an apolitical alternative store of value could rise. It won’t be a fun time. But it could be great for bitcoin.  The United States’ other option is a more radical departure from the status quo. Rather than putting the Federal Reserve and U.S. banks in the same old driving position, it could encourage the growth of non-government U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins that freely and rapidly flow internationally across decentralized blockchain protocols. In that case, one could imagine the greenback becoming even more sought after by foreigners as it will become readily available.  Under that scenario – one that USDC issuer Circle laid out in full-page U.S. newspaper ads this week – we might see the U.S. and its values of open, free trade gain even more influence worldwide. It would come at the expense of the Wall Street-centric model for moving money around the world, but it would drive global financial innovation broadly in U.S. interests.  In that setting, both stablecoins and native blockchain currencies such as ether and bitcoin would thrive. The freer flow of dollars globally would feed into a wider cryptocurrency, blockchain and Web 3 ecosystem and stir up demand for tokens.

The &apos;estimated leverage ratio&apos; is an indictor that&apos;s defined as the value of the Bitcoin open interest divided by the reserve of all exchanges. In simpler terms, what this metric tells us is the amount of leverage that an average user is making use of at the moment. When the value of this indicator rises, it means investors are taking on more risk as they are increasing the leverage on their positions. During such a trend, the volatility in the price of BTC may also go up. At sufficiently high values of the ratio, the market may be considered overleveraged, and a liquidation squeeze could follow to wipe out the excess leverage.

42422874,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0qZ3h,1644001083,Tron’s Justin Sun Accused of ‘Governance Attack’ on DeFi Lender Compound,"Members of crypto think tank GFX Labs’ governance division are ringing the alarm bells that a prominent large investor may be attempting to leverage large sums of capital to manipulate on-chain governance for a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol.  In a tweet on Friday, GFX’s Twitter handle called attention to a massive loan of Compound’s governance token, COMP, taken out by billionaire Justin Sun.  On-chain governance of DeFi protocols is often token-weighted, and while one GFX representative personally characterized the loan as a “governance attack,” there is nothing explicitly prohibiting users from taking out loans to vote on proposals they back.  Sun – founder of the Tron platform and now Grenada’s ambassador and permanent representative to the World Trade Organization – is an active DeFi user, and his primary address worth over $1 billion is widely tracked among on-chain sleuths. Sun didn't respond to a request for comment by press time.  What happened  On-chain data shows that on Thursday, Sun’s wallet borrowed 99,000 COMP tokens worth over $13 million and later sent 102,000 tokens to Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange.  On Friday, an address that received $9 million worth of COMP tokens from Binance proposed adding TUSD as a collateral asset on Compound, which would allow Compound users to take out loans against their TUSD holdings.  While it is impossible to definitively verify that the proposal address belongs to Sun, according to pseudonymous GFX Labs contributor PaperImperium, the pattern is reminiscent of a similar vote that took place in stablecoin issuer MakerDAO’s governance in January.  “Justin borrowed a large amount of MKR from Aave,” PaperImperium said. “Presumably this was to vote on a poll to create a TUSD-DAI Peg Stability Module. After it was noticed, he returned the MKR before voting.”  Creating a stability module would allow users to swap TUSD for MakerDAO’s DAI stablecoin at a fixed rate. In the poll, the community voted the proposal down before it could move to formal voting.  A TUSD representative wrote in Maker’s governance forums after the poll concluded that they were unaware of Sun’s actions, and that “we wouldn’t risk working with Justin Sun, or any whales, to manipulate votes.”  Sun is listed as an Asia markets adviser on TUSD’s website, and a blog post from 2020 notes that “ownership of TUSD will be moving over to an Asia-based consortium that will be working with TRON to develop TUSD on Ethereum, TRON and other blockchain networks.”  All about utility  Other stablecoins have attempted similar gambits in recent weeks as the need for utility pushes platforms to leverage “bribe” protocols.  There are dozens of decentralized stablecoins now on the market, which is largely dominated by centralized alternatives like Tether and USDC. Additionally, generating interest and usage is an uphill battle if lending protocols, and other DeFi platforms don’t accept deposits.  A growing number of services now cater to helping user in integrations, such as Bribe, which allows protocols to bribe Aave token holders to vote certain ways on proposals.  Read more: Pay-to-Play Governance Builds Steam as Bribe Raises $4M  Protocols like Abracadabra, the issuers of stablecoin MIM, have considered using Bribe in an effort to get listed on Aave, but following a controversy with an affiliated project, their efforts now seem unlikely to pass.",NEGATIVE,COMP | MKR | TUSD,COMP | EXCHANGE | MKR | BNB | TUSD,Andrew Thurman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/02/04/trons-justin-sun-accused-of-governance-attack-on-defi-lender-compound,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/556ff8c60684b06cef61d503074efb3a0ed7781b-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394324,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvbX05,1643998877,A Bridge Too Far: Does the Wormhole Hack Mean the Multi-Blockchain Dream Is Dead?,"This week’s $326 million hack of the Wormhole blockchain tool may feel bizarrely routine. It’s a massive theft by any sane standard – if it had been an old-fashioned bank robbery, it would have been the second largest of all time. But in crypto, it’s only the fourth-largest hack in a single brief decade. Some argue these recurring hacks are part of a learning process on the way to better security, though at this point it’s starting to feel more like an inevitable risk, just the cost of doing crypto business.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  But the Wormhole hack has much more specific implications for how the crypto-financial system will evolve. Wormhole is what’s known as a “bridge,” essentially a way to move control of digital assets from one blockchain to another. Moving assets between chains is a uniquely complex and strange task, even for the crypto world. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin presciently warned in early January of the “fundamental security limits of bridges.” Hart Lambur, co-founder of the oracle protocol UMA, warned on a Jan. 13 “Bankless” podcast episode that a poorly designed bridge “exposes users to a lot of risk that they don’t know they’re taking.”  At least on its face, the Wormhole attack certainly seems to support these grim assessments, with massive implications for investors and developers. That’s because the potential for secure inter-chain transfers will determine one of the most fundamental questions about the future of crypto: Will every blockchain be an isolated, independent ecosystem, or will they be able to talk to each other securely?  (There are entirely different concerns about Wormhole tied to the news that Jump Trading will simply refill the stolen ETH and make Wormhole users whole. That raises questions of moral hazard similar to those in fiat bailouts, but we’ll save those for another day.)  The utility of inter-blockchain communication is clear. Wormhole, for instance, allows “wrapped ETH,” a synthetic asset intended to be collateralized by actual ETH, to be traded on the Solana blockchain. That opens up a lot of interesting arbitrage opportunities for traders, as well as healthier diversification in things like liquidity pools.  More fundamentally, inter-blockchain communication is key to addressing scaling challenges. Ethereum, notoriously, has been experiencing extremely high fees in recent years because of congestion on the layer 1, or base, chain, which can be relieved by layer 2 companion systems built on top of it, but also by offloading some demand to independent chains. For instance, it’s not unreasonable to argue that more non-fungible tokens (NFT) can and should be minted on purpose-built blockchains.  But all of this starts to fall apart if separate chains can’t be made securely interoperable. In a world without trusted interchain communications, each layer 1 blockchain (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Avalanche, Tron, etc.) would have to rely entirely on capital, applications and users native to it. All things being equal, that would probably be a huge edge for Ethereum, simply because it has had such a head start in the smart contracts world. It would also be rather pessimistic for blockchain tech as a whole because it would make each blockchain more of a Web 2-style “walled garden,” reducing synergies and user choice.  The challenge of building secure bridges is a matter of visibility and trust. Very broadly, things like “wrapped ETH” on Solana can only be trusted if the bridge can truly assure that ETH collateral really exists on the Ethereum blockchain. But that introduces an inherently large number of opportunities for falsification because Solana (in this case) simply doesn’t have full access to the data and verifications that make native ETH trustworthy.  See also: 'Crypto-States' Will Compete With Corporates in the Metaverse | Opinion  A compelling illustration of this challenge was offered this week by the YouTube channel Thinklair, which compared interchain bridges to a medieval goldsmith using a promissory note from London to collect a gold payment in Paris. Just like those once-distant cities, communicating between blockchains involves a lot more uncertainty and, in some cases, a lot more trust of specific actors than transacting on a single blockchain and its “local” ecosystem. The Wormhole attacker was apparently able to spoof a signature on a promissory note, much as a traveling medieval con man might have.  The good news is that even if bridges like Wormhole turn out to be inherently risky, there are other approaches to representing assets across chains. Cosmos and Polkadot in particular are major projects from reputable teams building inter-blockchain connections that may be more secure than bridges like Wormhole. Cosmos’ system includes a standard called Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol, or IBC. Polkadot focuses instead on connecting “parachains” to its coordinating “relay chain.”  The computer-science nuances of those systems are beyond the scope of this column. But serious blockchain investors should spend some time trying to get a grip on the various inter-chain systems. Which ones succeed and which ones fail will have major implications for the entire industry.",NEGATIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | DOT | ETH | FIAT | SOL,David Z.

The company settled a case with the NYAG for $18.5 million a year ago stemming from its part in its sister company Bitfinex’s attempts to cover up an $850 million hole after problems with its payment processor Crypto Capital Corp.  “Bitfinex and Tether recklessly and unlawfully covered up massive financial losses to keep their scheme going and protect their bottom lines,” New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a release when the case was settled.  Besides paying a fine, Tether and Bitfinex are also required to submit quarterly statements showing the stablecoin issuer’s assets. After Tether submitted its balance sheet to the NYAG, CoinDesk made a Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) request for information about the reserves. That request was initially rejected, but CoinDesk subsequently appealed; an appeals officer agreed and reversed the decision, but Tether challenged the NYAG’s office in August, saying that releasing the details of its balance sheet would “would tilt the competing playing field against Tether.”  In a statement published Friday, Tether said:  “The settlement specified what information should be disclosed publicly (such as a breakdown of Tether’s reserves by category) and what should be disclosed privately to NYAG (such as particular investment details). The private aspects are those that no business would publish for the competition to exploit.”  In the Feb. 17, 2021 agreement, it was stipulated that:  “Publication of Tether’s Reserves: On at least a quarterly basis for a period of two (2) years following the effective date of this Settlement Agreement, Tether will publish the categories of assets backing tether (e.g., cash, loans, securities, etc.), specifying the percentages of each such category, and specifying whether any such category constituting a loan or receivable or similar is to an affiliated entity, in a form substantially similar to that previously presented to the OAG.” [Emphasis added.]  Tether, together iFinex, which also owns cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex, petitioned the New York State Supreme Court in August to block the state's attorney general's office from providing CoinDesk with documents detailing its reserves. CoinDesk became part of the case in January on the grounds that it had an interest in its outcome and that the investing public does, too.  In both its legal filing, as well as a public statement, Tether alleged that CoinDesk is seeking the documents because its parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), is an investor in Circle, the issuer behind a competing stablecoin. DCG also backs Blockstream, developer of the Liquid Network, a sidechain of Bitcoin and one of several systems Tether uses to issue USDT.

China is using the Winter Olympics in Beijing as an international test of its digital yuan, which it has been testing in the country since 2019. In Olympic Village, athletes and visitors can make purchases only with cash, a Visa card or the digital yuan, Toomey noted.  Toomey added, however, that China’s crackdown on private cryptocurrencies gave a potential opening for the U.S.  ""China's crackdown presents an opportunity for the United States to be the forerunner of crypto innovation, grounded in individual freedom, and other American and democratic principles,"" he wrote.  Toomey has asked the Treasury and State departments to scrutinize Beijing’s digital yuan rollout during the Olympics and provide a full briefing by March 7.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | REGULATION,Nelson Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/02/04/sen-pat-toomey-sounds-warning-about-chinas-digital-yuan-as-olympics-start,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b249d7687b5e532e74731bc771d277147bc02107-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Obviously following behind market leader bitcoin, it has posted small recoveries that brought it out from its last month low. But while this has been encouraging for investors, there is still a long way to go, meaning that the digital asset could go either way at this point. Bears are trying hard to drag it down to a new low and crypto analyst Justin Bennett maps out what could give the bears exactly what they want. Ethereum To $2,000? Currently, the price of Ethereum is trading close to $3,000. This does not mean that the digital asset has been able to test this coveted level. Rather, it is showing a bit of support around the $2,800 price point. Nevertheless, this remains a volatile market and the asset could easily fluctuate down as it would upwards.

42416763,e264UAkMOkEShzxWulY9EP,1643992307,Bitcoin Tops $40K for First Time in 2 Weeks,"Bitcoin (BTC) jumped to a two-week high on Friday as crypto traders grew more confident that the market has stabilized following a recent slump and some analysts flagged the possibility of a short squeeze.  The bitcoin price rose 8.9% over the past 24 hours to about $40,219, pushing past the key psychological threshold of $40,000 for the first time since Jan. 22. The largest cryptocurrency remains well off its all-time high of around $69,000 reached in December.  ""Several attacks on the downside have not been successful anymore as the risk has been taken out,"" said Daniel Kukan, a senior trader at Crypto Finance AG.  Kukan said his next target for the price level on the upside is about $42,000 to $43,000. He sees market support at $33,000 – or $28,000 in the worst case, ""which we have not touched.""  On an intraday basis, bitcoin has pierced above the top of its weeklong price range, after holding support above the $35,000 to $37,000 zone.  U.S. jobs report for January  Bitcoin dipped briefly after the U.S. Labor Department reported unexpectedly strong jobs growth in January, along with big upward revisions to the figures previously reported for 2021.  Theoretically, such a report would be negative for bitcoin, because the Federal Reserve might need to move more aggressively in hiking interest rates to keep the labor market from overheating. In general, bitcoin's price has responded negatively to tighter monetary policy.  ""Bitcoin's initial knee-jerk reaction to the shockingly strong nonfarm payroll report was weakness,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at the foreign-exchange brokerage Oanda.  But he noted that ""bitcoin has managed to stabilize despite rising inflationary pressures that continue to push global bond yields higher.""  The 10-year Treasury yield broke above a two week-long range of 1.92%. And the U.S. dollar also ticked higher over the past two hours, while stocks are roughly flat. Bitcoin often trades in sync with stocks.  Jason Deane, bitcoin analyst at Quantum Economics, said that ""bitcoin's recent moves do seem to have coincided with the latest U.S. jobs report, and it's possible this may simply have acted as catalyst for an overdue market move.""  Separately, the market may have gotten an extra dose of bullishness when Marathon Digital Holdings, a bitcoin mining company in North America, said Friday it had increasing its holdings of the cryptocurrency to about 8,595 BTC ($338 million).  Laurent Kssis, a crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) expert and director of CEC Capital, described that as a ""mammoth increase.""

42394552,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bwBjWz,1643987269,How to Buy Crypto on the Apps You Already Have,"If you are among the millions of people who are new to crypto and interested in investing in the burgeoning industry, the first question many face is how do you actually buy cryptocurrency?  In the early days of bitcoin, buying it required a level of effort and comfort with technology that deterred most people. But the industry has made significant strides since then, and the barrier to entry is now almost nonexistent. In fact, if you have already used Cash App, PayPal or Vemmo, you are most of the way there.  How to buy crypto on Cash App  Ever since Block’s Cash App introduced its pilot bitcoin services in 2017, it has continued to roll out more bitcoin-based functionalities, with the latest being the integration of the Lightning Network.  Simply put, Cash App is big on Bitcoin integrations, and it is arguably one of the easiest ways to get your hands on bitcoin, particularly if you already have a Cash App account and occasionally use the platform to access traditional payment and investment services. Below are the steps for purchasing bitcoin on Cash App.  On the Cash App home screen, locate and click on the “Bitcoin” tab.  You will then see an option for buying BTC. Click on that to continue.  The next step is to select the amount of BTC you wish to buy. You can click on ""…"" at the top right corner of your screen to enter a custom amount (applicable in situations where you cannot find your preferred amount on the default options).  After selecting a valid amount, enter your pin and click on the Confirm button to complete the purchase. You can confirm the transaction by checking your account balance.  Note that you must have enough money on your Cash App to facilitate this purchase. Apart from this basic bitcoin purchase method, you can also take advantage of other investing features, including auto-invest and custom orders.  How to buy crypto on PayPal  PayPal is another popular app that has incorporated bitcoin-focused products. Like Cash App, PayPal offers a simple way of acquiring bitcoin, albeit with some withdrawal restrictions.  When you buy bitcoin on PayPal, it is impossible to withdraw the coin to an external wallet. As a result, you will be limited to the services provided by PayPal. If you have no problem with those restrictions, however, you can start buying crypto by following the steps below.  From the dashboard of your PayPal account, click on the Finances tab and select Crypto.  Next, you need to choose your preferred cryptocurrency. At the time of writing, the options available to PayPal users are limited to bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin and bitcoin cash.  Once you have selected one of the four cryptocurrencies available, click the “Buy” option. At this juncture, you may need to verify your identity to continue.  Indicate the amount you want to purchase and click on the next “Buy” button to complete the transaction.  Note that you need to have enough funds on your PayPal balance before you can complete the transaction. If not, you must link your account to a debit card or a bank account. Also, depending on the amount of cryptocurrency you want to buy, you will be charged a fee when buying crypto on PayPal.  How to buy crypto on Venmo  In 2021, PayPal-owned Venmo enabled a feature specifically designed for those looking to buy and sell cryptocurrency. Like PayPal, Venmo imposes withdrawal restrictions as crypto holders cannot transfer their coins on or off Venmo’s platform. Another restriction you may also need to consider is the imposed maximum purchase limits set at $20,000 weekly and $50,000 yearly.  That said, below are steps you need to follow to buy cryptocurrency on Venmo.  First, you need to locate the Crypto coins tab at the bottom of your screen. Click that tab to see the array of cryptocurrencies you can buy on Venmo. Presently, the options available are bitcoin, ethereum, bitcoin cash and litecoin – the same selection as PayPal.  Select your preferred cryptocurrency to see the current price. If you are satisfied with the pricing, you can continue by clicking on the Buy option and entering the dollar equivalence of the amount of crypto you wish to purchase.  Once you have indicated an amount, click on Review to see the breakdown of your purchase, including all associated fees.  After reviewing your purchase, tap Buy if you are ready to complete the transaction. You can complete this purchase by using funds on your Venmo balance, a linked bank account or a linked debit card.  How to buy crypto on Robinhood  In line with the explosive adoption of cryptocurrency, Robinhood, like most traditional financial apps, now offers a section where users can purchase crypto. Unlike the other apps listed in this guide, Robinhood specializes in enabling trading services for its users. So Robinhood not only offers the ability to buy and sell crypto, but also allows you to trade cryptocurrency and even send it as a gift, and so if you are looking for an entry place to buy crypto that will grow with your interest, it may be a good choice for you.  Below are the steps to get started buying crypto on Robinhood:  From the home screen, navigate to the cryptocurrency section.  Here, you will find the order window on the right side of the screen. Enter the amount you want to buy in the appropriate field and click Review.  To complete your order, select Confirm.  Note that the steps listed above apply to those buying cryptocurrency from the web version of Robinhood. To purchase crypto on the mobile app, all you need to do is click on the Trade button while on the cryptocurrency section of the app. Next, you need to tap Order Types and select the buy option. Once you have selected an order type, confirm and submit your purchase by swiping up.  Notably, Robinhood supports the buying and selling of seven digital assets. They include:  Bitcoin  Ethereum  Litecoin  Ethereum Classic  Bitcoin Cash  Bitcoin SV  Dogecoin  As an additional feature, Robinhood has introduced a wallet service that gives users more control over their digital assets. When it launches, the crypto wallet feature will allow users to move their crypto funds off the Robinhood platform.  Keen to distance itself from the competition, Robinhood doesn't charge its users any fees for buying or selling cryptocurrency on its platform.

42394556,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bwBjwd,1643987190,How to Invest in Bitcoin Without Buying BTC,"“Digital gold” can sometimes feel as hard to get your hands on as the real thing. Tax-sheltered accounts or certain banks might not let you invest in bitcoin directly, crypto exchange accounts aren’t insured by the government and it’s easy to get overwhelmed by the daunting visage of an exchange order book.  There are, however, plenty of ways to invest in bitcoin without buying BTC directly.  Sign up for CoinDesk’s Learn Crypto Investing Course.  Derivative traditional financial instruments  When you hear terms like exchange-traded funds (ETFs), trusts, options and futures, they might sound complex and off-putting but don’t panic. Derivatives are essentially tradable contracts or shares that track the price of an underlying asset – in this case, bitcoin. So instead of having to go out and buy bitcoin directly on an unregulated crypto exchange, you can effectively trade paper that represents it instead. Contracts or shares can be settled in either cash (cash-settled) or actual bitcoin (physically delivered.)  These financial products have the benefit of being regulated, meaning investors are safeguarded by a number of consumer protections. Not to mention, tax guidance on regulated instruments is far clearer than when dealing directly with cryptocurrency, and there’s no need to set up a bitcoin wallet or navigate an unregulated exchange.  Bitcoin ETFs  A bitcoin ETF is an investment vehicle that trades on the stock market. Shares in the ETF are proportional to the price of bitcoin, which the ETF’s managers buy and sell. ETFs charge low fees and closely track the price of an underlying asset.  The catch is that ""spot"" ETFs – those that track the current price of bitcoin – are only offered in a handful of countries, such as Canada and Brazil. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has repeatedly denied applications for spot ETFs on the grounds that the bitcoin market is inherently manipulable, although some applications are outstanding. The SEC has, however, greenlighted several bitcoin futures ETFs, which track the value of short-term bets on the future price of bitcoin.  The main reason given by SEC Chairman Gary Gensler for the preference of futures-based ETFs over spot ETFs is that the former can be structured using the Investments Company Act 1940, which gives consumers greater protection.  Bitcoin closed-end funds or trusts  Since bitcoin spot ETFs aren’t legal in the U.S., the next best thing is a closed-end trust like the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which represents shares in a publicly traded fund. (Grayscale Investments, which manages the trust, is a unit of Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk.) Or it was the next best thing – until the redemptions became tricky to exercise because of SEC charges in 2016 and shares started to trade at a discount to bitcoin. Trusts like these may only exist until the SEC approves a spot bitcoin ETF; Grayscale is among the many applicants for one.  Read more: The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust: What It Is and How It Works  Bitcoin options and futures  Derivative products let you trade claims on the price of bitcoin rather than buying bitcoin outright.  A futures contract, for instance, lets you buy or sell bitcoin in the future at a price you decide today. It is, essentially, a bet on the future price of bitcoin. If your bet comes in, you could snag bitcoin at a bargain price or sell it for more than the market price. If it goes wrong, you could end up paying far more for your bitcoin or selling it at a loss when the contract expires.  Some bitcoin futures contracts are settled in cash – like those on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) – while those on, say, Deribit, are settled in bitcoin.  Perpetual swap contracts (known as perps) are futures contracts that never expire, and allow you to bet on bitcoin’s price … forever.  Read more: What Is a Perpetual Swap Contract?  Another avenue is trading bitcoin options: This grants you the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell bitcoin at the predetermined price (called a strike price) within a certain time period. In order to have this right to buy or sell, investors must pay an upfront cost known as a “premium.”  Both futures and options contracts are complicated products and in the U.S. come with additional requirements and approvals before you’ll be allowed to start buying calls or puts.  Alternative bitcoin investment options  Invest in companies that hold or trade bitcoin  Another way to gain exposure to bitcoin’s price is to purchase shares of publicly listed companies whose performance is tied to the price of BTC.  Coinbase, a publicly traded crypto exchange, makes most of its money through trading fees, and people tend to trade more frequently when bitcoin is performing well.  The most well-known company that keeps bitcoin on its books is Tesla, but there are many others who keep it in their portfolios. MicroStrategy has billions of dollars worth of bitcoin held in its treasury, causing some analysts to liken it to a quasi-bitcoin ETF. You can find a full list of companies that hold bitcoin in reserves here.  Mining stocks like Hut 8 Mining and Riot Blockchain, too, slump when bitcoin crashes and rise when the it performs well. This is because many bitcoin mining companies hold onto their bitcoin instead of selling it, or use their holdings to finance investments.  Invest in companies that support Bitcoin infrastructure  A further step away, but still a good one to consider, is to invest in companies that create the chips and other key components required by mining operations to succeed. Bitcoin relies on ASIC mining machines and cloud computing power, so you can investigate where the chips are made and how the mining is powered and invest in those companies.  Trade synthetic bitcoin  One limitation of bitcoin is that it is based on the Bitcoin blockchain which isn’t interoperable with other blockchains.  For example, you can’t trade bitcoin directly on any other blockchain such as Ethereum or Solana. However, it has become possible over the last few years to trade synthetic bitcoin on these blockchains. These tokens are minted on another blockchain and are pegged to bitcoin’s price.  Wrapped bitcoin is the most popular version of this. It’s an ERC-20 token tied to bitcoin locked up in vaults secured by crypto custodian BitGo. You can stake the token, called wBTC for short, into Ethereum-based decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Similar synthetic assets exist for other blockchains, like renBTC, or Sollet’s wrapped bitcoin for Solana.  You can find out how to mint your own wBTC here.  Bitcoin mining  If you can’t trade bitcoin directly, nothing’s stopping you from earning it.  One way to earn bitcoin is to set up a bitcoin mining rig. However, this is far more likely to be lucrative if you spend a lot of money on mining hardware, and it might take a while until you earn your money back – and all the while you’re exposed to bitcoin’s volatility. There are easier options, however, for less technical users such as,  Joining a bitcoin mining pool.  Cloud mining.  Still, some of the mining companies have market capitalizations in the billions of dollars.

42416765,e264UAkMOkEShzxWulY9RF,1643984636,JPMorgan Asset Management Chief Slams Bitcoin in ‘Maltese Falcoin’ Report,"Bitcoin’s lofty valuations are the “stuff that dreams are made of.”  So says Michael Cembalest, J.P. Morgan Asset & Wealth Management’s chairman of market and investment strategy, in a report that riffs on “The Maltese Falcon,” the 1941 film about a priceless artifact that comes to symbolize greed, and which turns out, in the end, to be fake.  “I won’t be buying it even though part of me wants to, regardless of consequences, since that’s what some crypto holders have been counting on from the beginning,” he wrote.  In his 30-page investigation, “The Maltese Falcoin: On cryptocurrencies and blockchains,” Cembalest swoops on what he sees as crypto’s much-vaunted but brittle use cases, such as store of value, cross-border remittances, decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and blockchain adoption in financial services.  Store of value  Starting with bitcoin as a store of value, Cembalest says he understands why people are interested in cryptocurrencies with a fixed supply as a store of value, given the developed world has drowned itself in debt and fiat money, at a pace that dwarfs anything seen in the wake of the financial crisis in 2008.  “Central Banks and Treasuries have created a massive confidence void, and it would have been strange if some alternative to fiat money didn’t appear on the scene,” the report says.  Considering bitcoin as a complement to gold, the store-of-value thesis holds up, in that more people are using it as a digital equivalent, but falls down when it comes to volatility and crypto’s correlation with other systemic risks and inflation.  “Bitcoin’s volatility continues to be ridiculously high, and its volatility often rises when equity market volatility is rising too,” Cembalest wrote.  Such volatility could be the byproduct of bitcoin concentration, the report states, adding that some 2% of bitcoin holders own 72% of its value. “For all the libertarian anti-elitists out there, that’s even worse than the concentration of US household wealth: it takes 10% of US households to get to 70% wealth, rather than just 2%,” he noted.  Cross-border payments  The report estimates that crypto has only managed to capture about 1% of remittances, a market ranging from $500 billion to $600 billion per year over the last decade.  The potential cost savings are hampered by the fact that recipients would need bank accounts in the destination country to be able to convert from crypto to cash.  “For people with bank accounts, off-ramp costs from crypto to fiat are equal to the cost of converting from dollar-based stablecoins to local currency, and then any cost of withdrawing that fiat,” Cembalest wrote.  DeFi  Cembalest acknowledges that disintermediation of banks and financial services is ongoing thanks to the rise of various fintech platforms but makes a withering assessment of how it’s done in DeFi.  “From what we can tell, most DeFi lending is simply over-collateralized crypto loans to other holders of crypto so that the latter can either (a) buy more crypto, or (b) obtain liquidity against appreciated crypto holdings without incurring capital gains taxes. Either way, it does not appear to be the kind of lending activity that could survive a large sustained decline in crypto prices themselves,” says the report.  Drawing on the experience of fintech-enabled peer-to-peer lending, Cembalest pointed to data showing higher loan delinquency rates than traditional bank loans, which is mostly a function of weaker underwriting standards. He added that a platform like Lending Club has seen its stock decline by 65% from its recent peak.  As far as a future world of peer-to-peer uncollateralized lending on blockchains goes, Cembalest said: “Good luck with that,” pointing to characteristics that might “terrify participants” in traditional collateralized lending pools.  “Crypto collateral may not be dedicated and assigned solely to the activity against which it is posted. In other words, crypto collateral can be ‘rehypothecated’ to back multiple activities,” the report says. “If you don’t remember what that word means, type ‘rehypothecation’ into Google along with the words ‘financial crisis’.”  The Maltese Falcoin by CoinDesk  NFTs  Cembalest “oddly enough” does not dismiss the NFT phenomenon, citing the rapid rise of modern art in the 20th century, which many people still find inaccessible or confusing.  “Just because you might not appreciate the artistic merit of Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs, that doesn’t mean others won’t,” the report says.  One Achilles’ heel when it comes to NFTs is the concentration of ownership, Cembalest said, just as bitcoin ownership is highly concentrated. He cited a study of the SuperRare NFT art platform that revealed just four collectors owned most of its works with only three degrees of separation between them and the 16,000 works of art they collected.  “This is a very high degree of insularity, even for standards of the art market. The study also found that the secondary market was even more concentrated than the primary market,” the report notes, while acknowledging art is one subset of the broader NFT space.  Rebuffs  A recurring motif in Cembalest’s thinking is the accelerated change of cultural preferences in recent times. That said, when he circulated his report among some crypto advocates and venture capitalists, the most common response was that he was being shortsighted.  For instance, Cembalest’s piece was like judging the value of the internet in 1995, according to one commentator. Who would have thought a search engine would be worth a trillion dollars back then, for example.  Going further back in time, another respondent said it would be wise to remember the electricity wars of the 1800s.  “The first stage of any innovation cycle is development of infrastructure,” the response said. “The high value applications come later. That’s what happened during the electricity wars when future use cases were vastly underestimated, even by the likes of Junius Spencer Morgan (father of JP Morgan) who thought electricity was a fad and that kerosene lamps worked just fine.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/02/04/jpmorgan-asset-management-chief-slams-bitcoin-in-maltese-falcoin-report,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/353b1cd97b21618ed3d2158b0b4b2e155bbc0afe-4000x2667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394563,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bwBkRP,1643983467,What Are Wrapped Tokens?,"Trying to trade bitcoin on the Ethereum blockchain is a little like trying to get a PC game to run on a Mac – it won’t work unless you install special software. Thankfully, on blockchains, this process is rather simple thanks to something called a wrapped token. But what is a wrapped token exactly, and how does it work?  Put simply, a wrapped token is a token that represents a cryptocurrency from another blockchain or token standard and is worth the same as the original cryptocurrency. Unlike the original cryptocurrency, the wrapped token can be used on certain non-native blockchains and later redeemed for the original cryptocurrency.  One of the biggest benefits of wrapped tokens is they create greater interoperability between non-compatible cryptocurrencies and blockchains – opening the door for things like bitcoin lending or borrowing ether on DeFi platforms. This provides greater liquidity to decentralized services and boosts the utility of crypto assets.  Wrapped bitcoin  The most popular wrapped token is called wrapped bitcoin (wBTC) – an ERC-20 version of bitcoin.  As of Feb. 1, 2022, the token has a market capitalization of over $10 billion and is secured by crypto custodian BitGo. Wrapped bitcoin dominates 81% of the market for wrapped tokens; the next largest token, renBTC, has a market capitalization of $672 million. WBTC was created by BitGo, Kyber and Ren in 2019.  Wrapped bitcoin is useful because it allows bitcoin investors to plug their asset – or, technically, a synthetic asset that offers the same exposure to bitcoin’s price – into decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols on Ethereum. This unlocks the potential to turn bitcoin into a yield-bearing asset, one that can earn returns from something like liquidity pools on Uniswap or Yearn Finance, for example.  To acquire wrapped bitcoin, you can wrap your own BTC by finding a wBTC merchant such as DeversiFi, Kyber or Ren. The merchant sends your bitcoin to a custodian who mints newly wrapped bitcoin at a 1:1 ratio and stores your deposited bitcoin. When you want to redeem your wBTC for bitcoin, the merchant will send a burn request to the custodian who will then destroy the wBTC and return your bitcoin back to you.  This system of minting and burning wBTC ensures there is always exactly one bitcoin backing every single wBTC in circulation. This is fundamentally similar to how pegged-value stablecoins work.  Alternatively, you can buy wBTC for other cryptocurrencies on centralized or decentralized exchanges.  WBTC isn’t a perfect solution, since it introduces a degree of centralization into the mix. If you hold wrapped bitcoin, you’re entrusting BitGo with your money.  Wrapped ethereum  Wrapped bitcoin isn’t the only useful wrapped token. Another prominent wrapped token is wrapped ether (wETH,) launched by 0x labs in 2017.  Unlike wBTC, whose sole purpose is to port bitcoin onto non-native blockchains (currently it supports Ethereum and Tron), one of the main purposes of wETH is to trade synthetic ether right on the Ethereum blockchain.  That’s because wETH converts ether (ETH) into an ERC-20 token – a tradable version of ETH that’s compliant with decentralized finance protocols. ETH, the native token of Ethereum, doesn’t conform to the ERC-20 standard.  You can think of token standards as a set of rules a token must follow to ensure it is compatible with other Ethereum-based services and platforms. Different token standards are used to create different subsets of assets that are compatible with particular services, such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) or fungible tokens.  Wrapped ETH opens up a whole new world of decentralized finance for ETH holders. With wETH, they can trade directly with other Ethereum-based altcoins and pledge funds to DeFi protocols.  Unlike wBTC, you don’t actually ""wrap"" ETH at all. To acquire it, you simply trade ETH for wETH through a smart contract, or on a digital wallet like MetaMask. The team behind wrapped ether hopes that the token will eventually be phased out once Ethereum’s code base is updated to make ether conform with the ERC-20 token standard, or if the ERC-20 standard gets overhauled.  Bridges  Products like wBTC aren’t the only way to port assets to different blockchains. Bridges to Polygon, Arbitrum and Optimism let you port assets from Ethereum and trade on those networks at lower costs and quicker speeds. For instance, Osmosis’s Gravity Bridge lets you trade ERC-20 tokens on its Cosmos-based decentralized exchange, and Tezos’s Wrap Protocol Bridge lets you port assets to and from Ethereum.  Huge bridges, like the Wormhole bridge, support many different blockchains. Wormhole, for example, supports Ethereum, Solana, Terra, Binance Smart Chain and Polygon. The bridge also supports NFTs, meaning that you could port a Solana NFT onto Ethereum. On Feb. 2, 2022, however, the Wormhole bridge was exploited for 120,000 wETH (worth over $326 million at the time) highlighting a serious flaw in the technology.  Niche wrappers, like Emblem Vault, create wrappers for entire cryptocurrency wallets; traders have used the protocol to turn old Bitcoin NFTs, minted on Counterparty as early as 2014, into Ethereum-based NFTs. Ronin Bridge is a purpose-built bridge for the Axie Infinity NFT game.  Combined, Ethereum bridges hold $23.24 billion in assets, according to a dashboard on Dune Analytics. Polygon, Avalanche and Fantom dominate the market, holding sway over 23%, 22% and 18% of the market, respectively. About 25% of the assets in the bridges, or about $6 billion, are held in wETH, with a further 22%, or $5.2 billion, being held in the U.S. dollar stablecoin, USDC.  Bridges may soon conquer the DeFi market; it’s easier to trade wrapped tokens in one place rather than wrapped individual cryptocurrencies. However, perhaps the future of DeFi will make it so seamless to trade tokens across blockchains that you won’t even realize you’re using a bridge or a wrapped token.

Bitcoin was trading slightly lower after the report, possibly because the faster-than-expected jobs growth might keep pressure on the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary conditions – seen as a negative in cryptocurrency markets.  The U.S. Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics published its latest employment situation report Friday in a statement. The January number was much higher than economists' average estimate of 150,000 in a Dow Jones survey, though some economists had warned that the variability from Omicron and other data-related issues might make the latest report harder to analyze.  ""Employment growth continued in leisure and hospitality, in professional and business services, in retail trade, and in transportation and warehousing,"" the bureau said.  Crypto traders were monitoring the report because many investors see bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, and a tighter jobs market could put upward pressure on wages – which businesses might in turn try to pass through to consumers in the form of higher retail prices.  Bitcoin was down 1% in the minutes after the report was released to about $37,500.  The number of jobs added in December was revised higher by 311,000 jobs to 510,000.  Unemployment rate  The unemployment rate was ""little changed"" at 4% in December, according to the report.  A hot labor market could put pressure on the Fed to raise interest rates sooner than later, as more spending could drive inflation up even higher. More pressure from the Fed could weaken bitcoin returns, according to some analysts.  “If the data suggests the Fed will need to be more aggressive with rate hikes, look out for more risk-off flow, which for the time being, will continue to have a negative impact on crypto,"" said Joel Kruger, market strategist at LMAX Digital.  Economists were warning even before the January jobs report came out that the data might be messy because of the unpredictable and wide-ranging impact on employers and workers from Omicron.  The count of jobs gained or lost is measured through a survey that asks employers for the number of workers they have on their payrolls during the period of measuring. That excludes workers who were out sick, or missed work for other reasons, like taking care of someone or quarantining. Those people still kept their jobs, but they weren’t accounted for in the report, which is why the number could be misleading.  The main question now is how seriously the Fed takes the data reported this month, considering the significant measurement issues and how it will affect the central bank’s decision in the upcoming weeks.  The labor participation rate, which measures the percentage of the American population that is either working or actively looking for work, was 62.6%, up from 61.9% in December.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/02/04/us-jobs-report-shows-gain-of-467000-in-january-exceeding-expectations,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c64b84fa736b9cee1598757f453beb325534112d-5000x3333.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Buyers in August 2021 needed anomalous volumes to break and fix higher. https://www.tradingview.com/x/M6viP1SY/ However, in January 2022, no fight can be seen on the chart. The liquidity zone, which was key to the continued growth of the SOL price was broken at the lowest trading volumes in the trading history. Extremely alarming sign that makes us think globally about the caution of investing in altcoins in the near future. SOL Technical Analysis On The Daily Timeframe https://www.tradingview.com/x/C8WPvRSA/ At the moment, buyers are trying to form a local wave of growth. The main volume accumulation range for the SOL price rebound is $90-$97. That&apos;s where the trading volumes are increased in the daily timeframe. In addition, the chart shows that the fall wave was parabolic and constantly accelerating. The last attempt of sellers to regain power was on 2nd and 3rd February. The chart shows an attempt to break the $90-$97 range in high volumes. However, as a result, the daily candles were closed with pins down.

42416755,e264UAkMOkEShzxWulY91Z,1643974341,"India's Crypto Tax May Curb Excessive Speculation, Bring Institutional Demand","The Indian crypto market may remain insulated from the next meme token frenzy as a result of the recently proposed tax on virtual currency transactions.  Earlier this week, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced that profits from the sale of virtual assets would be taxed at a flat rate of 30% without any deductions or exemptions. The rate is on par with the highest income tax band, which applies to individuals earning more than 1.5 million rupees ($20,000) a year. The government also introduced a 1% tax, deducted at source (TDS), on cryptocurrency trading.  Observers said the steep tax rate might deter the gambling and excess speculation seen during the bull market frenzy of April, October and early November last year.  ""We believe the taxation structure introduced by the government will certainly discourage speculators and punters,"" Suraj Ramakrishnan, a chartered accountant and member of the founding team at Mumbai-based crypto asset management firm MintingM, said.  While TDS might help the government keep a tab on the money flow, it could pose a problem for short-term traders.  ""One percent TDS by government is a tactical move to get records/trail of all transactions which would bring exchanges and investors under better compliance. However, the TDS amount could turn out to be very high for frequent traders,"" said Ravi Jain, co-founder of Blostem Fintech.  High-frequency trading involves using powerful algorithmsto conduct a large number of transactions in fractions of a second. Aditya Singh, a co-founder of Crypto India, said 1% TDS is too much, and with enough trades, an entity's initial account capital would be significantly depleted.  ""With 1% TDS, a trader with an initial account balance of INR 100,000 can lose 10% of his money in just 11 transactions assuming these trades didn't generate profit and each transaction involved complete account balance,"" Singh noted in a Twitter chat.  Rajat Lalwani, a SHIB holder and moderator at Shiba Inu India Official, a Telegram group with more than 2,000 India-based retail investors, said the new tax structure is less of a concern for long-term holders.  ""Most people who are unhappy right now are day traders. They book petty percentage profits, and this wouldn't go well with them,"" Lalwani told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat. ""People holding for the long term will slightly be less worried than the day traders.""  During the height of the meme token frenzy in October and early November, SHIB pairs accounted for nearly 50% of the daily trading volume on WazirX, a Binance-backed exchange based in Mumbai, and other platforms serving India-based clients. At the time, investors from smaller cities in semi-urban and rural areas were trading SHIB in a bid to make big profits in a short period.  The frenzy has cooled, and SHIB has crashed 75% from its October peak of $0.00008894. With the new tax structure, retail investors are likely to think twice before gambling during a meme token frenzy.  Institutional participation  While several publicly listed companies in the U.S. have added bitcoin to their balance sheets, the Indian corporate world has stayed on the sidelines, perhaps due to regulatory uncertainty. That might change now.  ""After clarity on taxation, we note that a lot of Indian institutions would look favorably at investing balance sheet money in the crypto markets,"" MintingM's Ramakrishna said.  While institutional investors dislike regulatory ambiguity and uncertainty, the recent announcement of tax rules has cleared the air to some extent. The move also indicates that the government may be warming up to the crypto sector and might be set to regulate top cryptocurrencies like investment assets.  Last year, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs asked all India-based companies to mandatorily disclose any dealings in cryptocurrency or virtual currency in their balance sheets. The move was widely hailed as the first step toward regulating the crypto markets.",NEUTRAL,SHIB,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | SHIB | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/02/04/indias-crypto-tax-may-curb-excessive-speculation-bring-institutional-demand,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

On December 24, 2021, there were 2.5 million Cardano wallets in circulation. Since then, over 500,000 ADA wallets have been added. And, as of February 3, the total number of ADA wallets stands at 3,002,727, showing that over 12,200 wallets were added per day, resulting in a 20.1% rise in total wallets. Alonzo and Other Cardano Updates Network development is coinciding with wallet expansion, as Cardano smart contracts recently passed the 1,000 mark on January 27 this year. Following this, the number of smart contracts increased by 116 on January 30 and February 1, the highest increase in history. The ADA&apos;s scalability and speed were improved thanks to the Alonzo upgrade in September 2021, which included the addition of smart contract functionality. This had an impact on the Cardano blockchain load, which stayed above 90% for more than a week, marking the first time the system has ever reached this level of blockchain load and maintained those parameters. Meld, a new decentralized financial system based on the Cardano blockchain, recently secured 100 million stakes in its native currency MELD in just three days after launching.

42394565,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bwBkWX,1643974178,NFTs: 4 Piracy and Copyright Essentials for Buyers and Sellers,"The main attraction of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is they allow holders to immutably and verifiably prove their exclusive ownership over intangible assets, like a piece of digital art or a song. But while this technology might seem revolutionary, the reality is far more convoluted.  The NFT market is rife with piracy and plagiarism, and buyers still appear to be unclear about the copyright and intellectual property laws that underpin their purchases. Things needn’t be so grim: Read on to uncurl your vexed mind.  1. Check for a blue tick  One simple way to avoid fraud in the NFT market is to buy only from verified projects. Anyone can right-click and save an expensive NFT, and then re-upload that NFT and label it whatever they like.  Crypto’s pull-yourself-up-by-the-bootstraps mentality foists the responsibility of verifying that NFT on the buyer. Platforms like OpenSea get around this by issuing blue ticks for “verified collections” – you can also check the contract address to work out whether an NFT you plan to buy is from a legitimate project. Remember that even if someone’s Twitter profile picture is reshaped to a hexagon, that NFT might not be from a verified project and could be fraudulent.  That being said, a blue tick isn’t watertight – the owners of the project could still defraud or abandon the project if they wanted.  2. Check the artist has actually minted NFTs  But what about newer collections where the seller isn’t verified?  Some NFTs are minted without the permission of the artist – meaning that not only are you not buying from a verified collection, but you are buying an NFT from someone other than the artist. Musician Nat Puff, for instance, reported that NFTs of her tracks uploaded to music NFT marketplace HitPiece aren't hers. As proof, she clarified her opinion of non-fungible technology: “NFT’s are s**t & if you support them you’re indirectly supporting the downfall of independent artistry.”  If you have doubts, try to find their Twitter or other online presence to verify if they are minting NFTs. Many artists will pin tweets signaling whether they have NFTs available for sale. You can also reach out to the artist and ask if an NFT is theirs.  Bot-driven art theft is prevalent enough that DeviantArt has created a project specifically to scan and report art theft on large platforms.  3. If you buy an NFT, you probably don’t own the copyright  This is a big misconception that many people have about NFTs.  When you buy an NFT, you are purchasing the ownership of a blockchain-based token that simply points to a file, clip or image’s location. This means holders only possess the right to hold and sell the token, not the copyright over what it points to – unless, of course, you have negotiated in advance with the seller, or special provisions were laid out beforehand that states intellectual property rights move with the token.  Under U.S. copyright law, the artist, by default, owns the copyright to their work.  Nowhere was this more apparent than with SpiceDAO, which bought one of the last copies of Alejandro Jodorowsky's manuscript for his unfinished film adaptation of the classic sci-fi novel “Dune” for $3.8 million. SpiceDAO planned to “make the book public (to the extent permitted by law)” and sell an ""original animated limited series"" based on the book to a streaming service.  The project drew ridicule after onlookers, like Jamie Powell in the Financial Times, reminded readers that “buying a copy of something doesn’t give you exclusive rights to monetize its content.” BuzzFeed reported that the copyrights for the book’s content “are held by multiple artists and their estates,” and that the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) must now convince copyright holders to let them play around with the intellectual property.  Read More: What Own When You Buy an NFT  Sometimes copyright ownership is unclear. That’s certainly the case for CryptoPunks. Research from Eric Paul Rhodes last July found that CryptoPunks creator Larva Labs adopted the NFT license in 2019, which would grant non-commercial use, aside from revenue of $100,000 from merchandise, but wouldn’t let NFT holders alter the image. Rhodes found that a separate license agreement was adopted that didn’t include provisions for merchandise sales.  Relating to advice No. 2, you would obviously not own the rights to an NFT minted fraudulently. And if you sell a fraudulent NFT, you could be liable, under section 504 of the Copyright Act, for fines of up to $30,000 for each infringement.  4. You might hold copyright over the asset, but check the terms and conditions first  Sometimes you do hold the copyright. Gremplin, the evil king that rules over the fictional CrypToadz metaverse, has, “To the extent possible under law … waived all copyright and related or neighboring rights to CrypToadz by Gremplin.” CrypToadz was created under a Creative Commons license (CC0), which lets anyone create spinoff projects or modify their NFTs without fear of legal backlash.  The Bored Ape Yacht Club’s creators, Yuga Labs, also outlined that holders own “the underlying Bored Ape, the Art, completely.” So as long as you can prove that you hold the NFT, Yuga Labs grants you “an unlimited, worldwide license to use, copy and display the purchased Art for the purpose of creating derivative works based upon the Art,” like creating T-shirts – so long as you can prove that you own the token.

The token, dubbed ZipangCoin (ZPG), will be sold to retail investors and will be linked to the price of gold in yen, procured by Mitsui from the London Metal Exchange, according to the report. The price of one ZPG will equal the value of one gram of gold and will be guaranteed by Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp., Nikkei wrote.  ZPG is likely to be Japan's first gold-linked token, but not the first such token in the world. Being pegged to the price of gold, ZPG is likely to be a relatively stable crypto.  ZPG will initially be sold through Mitsui's own exchange. The exchange, which has been set up along with Seven Bank and others, is registered with the Kanto Local Finance Bureau and is licensed by Japan's Financial Services Agency (FSA), Nikkei Asia reported. Kanto is the region encompassing the Greater Tokyo Area.  Mitsui plans to also use ZPG as a payments tool, used at the trading house's affiliated retailers through a smartphone app and other digital payment systems, according to the report.  FSA-registered exchanges that want to trade ZPG will have to undergo user identity verification, the report said.  The coin will run on a private blockchain, unlike those that cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether are based on, according to the Nikkei Asia report. Private, also called permissioned, blockchains control who participates in the network.  Sumitomo Mitsui Banking is also part of a consortium of more than 70 Japanese banks and industry leaders that are working to issue a bank deposit-backed digital yen.

42416778,e264UAkMOkEShzxWulY9xL,1643967594,"Metaverse Tokens AXS, SAND Plummet as Meta Reports $10B Loss","Metaverse-related tokens took a hit in the past two days as Meta, formerly known as Facebook, reported a $10 billion loss on its augmented and virtual reality division in an earnings release earlier this week.  The metaverse broadly refers to a virtual world in which people can interact as they do in the real world, but digitally.  Tokens of blockchain-based games Axie Infinity (AXS), The Sandbox (SAND), and Gala (GALA) fell as much as 12% in the past 24 hours, continuing a slide since Wednesday night.  In early Asian hours on Thursday, AXS fell to under $46 before slightly recovering to $49 in afternoon hours. It traded over $53 before Meta’s earnings release on Wednesday. AXS now sits at support levels last seen in September, before the tokens began a multi-month run to all-time highs of $162 in November.  The drop in token prices was coupled with falling user activity on Axie Infinity, crypto research firm Delphi Digital found, partly in connection with the game’s native smooth love potion (SLP) tokens.  “As SLP prices dip, players suffer as they cannot earn as much when compared to a few months back,” Delphi analysts said in a note. “At its peak, a player could have earned $35 per day on July 21 vs $1 today at current prices (assuming 100 SLP/day). This has led many players to stop playing as the income has been reduced massively.”  Price-charts for SAND and GALA show similar woes. SAND prices dropped 50 cents after Meta’s earnings release, declining as much as 10% in a 24 hour period on Thursday. GALA dipped to $0.18 from $0.20 in the same period. Both tokens gained slightly in Asian morning hours on Friday alongside a recovery in the broader crypto market.  The metaverse concept has gained traction in the past year, alongside the rise of non-fungible tokens (NFT). Metaverse iterations extend from electronics giant Samsung opening a pop-up store in Decentraland to crypto exchanges FTX.US and Binance.US setting up offices in Solana-based Portals.  But reality has been more sobering. Metaverse games continue to cater to a niche in the crypto market, while virtual reality divisions like Meta’s Facebook Reality Labs (FRL) pile on losses.  Are metaverse tokens and metaverse stocks correlated?  Some developers say the market performance of traditional companies focused on the metaverse could drive correlations in metaverse-based tokens.  ""There surely is a correlation between the success of Meta with its metaverse efforts and the perceived potential of metaverse/play-to-earn projects and tokens,” explained Adrian Krion, CEO of blockchain gaming platform Spielworks, in an email to CoinDesk.  “There's been a surge of interest in the space since Facebook's rebranding, so any setback in Facebook's metaverse strategy will directly impact the market perception of other metaverses,” Krion added.  Others say metaverse tokens are a proxy bet for investors until metaverse stocks gain more traction.  “Without clear utility for the value of the metaverse tokens, it serves as a proxy for investor's sentiments on the future of the metaverse,” said Vincent Choy, ecosystem architect of Oz Finance, in an email to CoinDesk. “I believe that there will correlation between the tokens and stocks until the industry matures a lot more.”  The Facebook Reality Labs (FRL) division made $2.3 billion in revenue in 2021, a fraction of the over $116 billion generated from Meta’s various businesses, such as Facebook, photo-sharing application Instagram and messaging platform WhatsApp.  Meta isn’t retreating despite the losses. CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Wednesday the company's metaverse developments include releasing a high-end virtual reality headset by the end of the year and that the company would continue to work on ""Nazare,"" a pair of fully augmented reality glasses.",NEGATIVE,AXS | SAND | GALA,AXS | BUSINESS | MARKET | SAND | GALA,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/02/04/metaverse-tokens-axs-sand-plummet-as-meta-reports-10b-loss,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/766bdd9c817e11998d04b06ee9ee40daa2622098-2190x1369.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It also includes key promotional materials such as LED advertising around the pitch at all home games, as well as other wide-reaching advertising tools and co-branded content.  ""TSG Hoffenheim is happy to be working together with such an innovative and leading brand like Baby Doge,” confirmed Denni Strich, TSG's CEO, in a press statement. “We'll bring an NFT collection from the club and other exciting projects to life.”  Baby Doge’s team said further partnerships are likely to increase the project’s brand value. “We endeavor to expand our global reach as a community-centered project, as well as to form strategic partnerships with world-class organizations,” said Baby Doge project manager Mike Watson. “(This) will enable Baby Doge to showcase our benefits and establish ourselves as a player in the sports world.”  TSG Hoffenheim is one of the oldest German football clubs and was founded 122 years ago in 1899.

According to Bloomberg sources, if the proposed laws are passed, exchanges that have registered with the Financial Services Agency (FSA) will be permitted to offer some assets without going through a lengthy screening procedure Additional screening would be waived for digital assets that have been listed on at least three domestic exchanges for more than six months. If the plan passes, exchanges will find it easier to list Bitcoin and Ethereum. A final decision on the regulation modification has yet to be made. Currently, coins must go through a lengthy screening procedure that can take up to six months to complete.

The hacker was able to mint 120,000 wETH by exploiting Solana&apos;s verification system and then transferred at least 93,750 ETH from Wormhole&apos;s smart contract to the Ethereum ecosystem. The current wETH floating in Solana&apos;s decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem would have remained unbacked without the Wormhole parent company&apos;s intervention to restore the missing money. Wormhole&apos;s cross-chain bridge allows users to lock current assets in other blockchains as collateral in Solana&apos;s ecosystem. A wormhole has since patched the vulnerability and offered the hacker a $10 million white hack agreement in exchange for returning the cash and disclosing the exploit&apos;s data, but the remaining 93,750 ETH in the perpetrator&apos;s wallet address suggests that no agreement has been reached. According to statistics from Mango Markets, a decentralized trading platform on Solana, wETH on Solana fell nearly $200 below its Ethereum counterpart in the Ethereum blockchain but has now re-established its peg.
