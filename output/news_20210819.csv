Developers, community projects, and IOG are preparing for the milestone and the potential growth of the network&apos;s ecosystem.

The project has been under development by IOG and partners Emurgo, and Ergo blockchain, as a &apos;stablecoin contract&apos;, Cardano&apos;s developer claimed in an official post.

As seen below, this Cardano based stablecoin will operate with an Autonomous &apos;Central bank like&apos; contract. Thus, it&apos;ll be comprised of reserve, equity, and liabilities.

42397116,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaYnO8,1629409792,Compass Mining Says Chase Shut Down Bank Accounts Without Warning,"Bitcoin mining firm Compass Mining’s bank accounts with Chase Bank, the retail banking arm of JPMorgan Chase, were terminated without warning earlier this week, according to Compass CEO Whit Gibbs.      Gibbs took to Twitter on Wednesday to announce the shutdown, writing: “Shoutout to Chase for shutting down Compass Mining accounts for doing our part to replace the old guard with self-sovereign, future-focused supporters of hard money.”      According to Gibbs, Compass Mining learned about the account closures when Jameson Nunney, its chief operations officer, visited a local branch in Ohio to make a transaction and was told by an employee that the company’s accounts had been frozen the day before and that Chase would be holding the money until Aug. 27. The accounts held about 7% of the company’s cash.      This is not the first time Chase has closed accounts belonging to crypto-related companies or to individuals making crypto transactions. Yet Chase has also expanded its crypto banking services, and it took on crypto exchanges Coinbase and Gemini as customers last year. And earlier this year, Chase began allowing its retail wealth management clients access to crypto funds.      But the closure of Compass Mining’s account signals that Chase may not have completely changed its skeptical view about crypto. At the time of publication, a Chase spokesperson was looking into the matter and had not yet provided comment.      Gibbs told CoinDesk that although Compass Mining was told that its account with Chase was undergoing a review about 90 days ago, it was not given warning about the closure.      Compass Mining believed that the review was to determine whether its account was eligible for an upgrade. Gibbs said Compass Mining's Chase relationship manager told executives they had nothing to worry about.      But Gibbs said the relationship manager then cut off communications. The accounts were closed without Compass Mining receiving a letter or an email to inform it of the move, much less an explanation.      After Gibbs tweeted about the closure, he was flooded with messages of support and offers to provide services from a number of banks.      “The response from the community was fantastic,” Gibbs told CoinDesk.

At press time, ADA was trading at $2.35, up 14% during the past 24 hours, based on CoinDesk pricing.  ADA reached an all-time-high price of $2.47 in May.  Lead Cardano developer Input Output recently announced a timeline for the Alonzo upgrade, targeting Sept. 12 for the final release date.  Smart-contract functionality would allow Cardano to incorporate more applications, including decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms that allow for automated cryptocurrency lending and trading.  The improvement could put the network in a better position to challenge Ethereum, currently the leader among blockchains with smart-contract functionality.  In a prediction market started in July that allows participants to bet on whether Cardano can release smart-contract functionality by Oct. 1, the betting contract was trading at 79 cents as of press time.  That is up from 30 cents on July 18 when the market was first launched but down from its all-time high of 85 cents on Aug. 12 and Aug. 15.

Cryptocurrencies have been consolidating near highs as a slew of negative headlines have kept buyers on the sidelines.      On Wednesday, minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) showed the Federal Reserve is considering slowing its pace of asset purchases later this year. Concerns about fading stimulus triggered a pullback in equities and commodities, and also weighed on cryptocurrencies.      News about a hack at Japan’s Liquid Global exchange on Thursday also weakened bullish sentiment in the crypto market. While the total amount stolen has yet to be determined, the value taken in bitcoin, ether, ripple, tron and other coins could be upward of $90 million, reports CoinDesk’s Eliza Gkritsi.    Latest prices    Cryptocurrencies:    Bitcoin (BTC) $46582, +4.18%  Ether (ETH) $3150.5, +4.12%    Traditional markets:    S&P 500: 4405.8, +0.13%  Gold: $1781.3, -0.3%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.248%, compared with 1.272% on Wednesday    For now, analysts are closely monitoring bitcoin’s 200-day moving average.      “An ability for BTC to hold the 200-day moving average would be the first domino to fall in a move towards a rally through the end of this year,” FundStrat wrote in a newsletter Wednesday.      FundStrat is bullish on crypto and expects near-term weakness to fade as macro conditions remain supportive for assets that are deemed to be risky.      “We notice a mid-cycle trend forming in which active market participants are moving from BTC and ETH and into other alternative coins,” FundStrat wrote.    Less heated rally    The cost to fund long positions in the market for bitcoin perpetual swaps, a type of derivative in cryptocurrency markets similar to futures contracts in traditional markets, remains relatively low compared with previous market rallies.      “When there are substantial increases in price, we often observe concurrent run-ups in the funding rate since investors start to chase long positions,” FundStrat wrote. “Based on the chart below, we can see that while funding rates are positive, things are not remotely overheated when juxtaposed to recent price action.”    Bitcoin underperforms    So far this month, “cryptocurrencies were flying once again as investors' appetites for high risk pushed the prices higher,” Lukas Enzersdorfer-Konrad, chief product officer at crypto exchange Bitpanda, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.      But bitcoin has taken a back seat as altcoins outperformed over the past two weeks. Cardano, XRP and dogecoin locked in gains of more than 40%, compared with a nearly 7% gain for bitcoin over the same period, according to CoinDesk price data.      The outperformance of altcoins could continue, especially given the recent technical breakout in ether relative to bitcoin.      Altcoins are considered to be riskier than BTC, and rising ETH/BTC pairs could reflect a greater appetite for risk in the crypto market, Enzersdorfer-Konrad wrote.    Cardano short-term overbought    Cardano (ADA), which is billed as a third-generation blockchain (following Bitcoin and Ethereum as the first and second generations, respectively), is approaching an all-time high of around $2.40, which was reached in May.      ADA held support at its 200-day moving average, which attracted strong buying power as the crypto selloff stabilized in June. The nearly 60% price rally over the past month appears to be exhausted given extreme overbought signals on the charts. A pullback is expected in the near-term, although the price is expected to stay above the $1.80 to $2 support zone.    Ethereum staking    Ethereum miners could be out of business in six months as the Ethereum mainnet merges with the Beacon Chain proof-of-stake system, Tim Ogilvie, co-founder and CEO of crypto staking service provider Staked, told CoinDesk.      It’s in contrast with some crypto miners’ bets on the delay of Ethereum’s upgrade to a proof-of-stake system, as they increased investments in ethereum mining, CoinDesk’s David Pan reported earlier.      “My gut is they probably are going to sort of run for six months,” Ogilvie said. “And then they're going to shift that mining equipment to mine on other chains. And so there's probably some ancillary work they can do.”      Staking on ETH 2.0 via Staked renders a nominal yield of 6.8%, and Ogilvie estimates the number will reach 8% to 9% upon completion of the Merge. Such return comes with risks, he noted.      “The risk of staking now is it's illiquid, until such time as transactions are enabled on Ethereum 2.0, so you've got some indefinite period of time, call it 12 to 18 months, before you can actually spend or use your ETH,” Ogilvie said. He also warned about the slashing of penalties in the proof-of-stake mode when a validator node “tried to cheat the system or had a technical error.”    Altcoin roundup  Polygon to Form Decentralized Autonomous Organization: Ethereum scaling platform Polygon said it will build a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) for the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, CoinDesk’s Jamie Crawley reports. Polygon's aim is for the DAO to attract 100 million users and invite this community to have a say in its DeFi development, according to an emailed announcement Thursday. Forming a DAO is ""the next logical step"" to aiding collaboration between blockchain-based systems, given that projects such as Aave, Curve and SushiSwap are already using Polygon as a scaling system.  Poly Network Sends Bounty as Attacker Holds $141M Hostage: Poly Network, the China-based blockchain protocol that lost more than $6000 million when it was hacked earlier this month, said Thursday it had sent a bounty worth nearly $500,000 to the attacker and that most of the looted cryptocurrency has now been fully recovered. But the attacker apparently has yet to provide a key needed to unlock the remaining $141 million. “There are users who are panicking that they might lose control of their assets, and we want to minimize the impact on them, so restoring our network and our users’ assets in a secure manner as quickly as possible is our top priority,” Poly Network wrote early Thursday in an email.  Custody Firm Anchorage Launches Governance Voting With DeFi Giant Aave: Regulated cryptocurrency custody firm Anchorage is offering blockchain governance voting services, starting with DeFi platform Aave. Institutions and token holders can use Anchorage’s governance portal to participate in on-chain governance decisions critical to the Aave lending protocol. The system uses a separate voting key so that digital assets can remain safely in storage, the companies said Thursday.

Sroge joined Binance.US in January 2020, serving as its CFO.  Brooks’ exit after just four months and the similarly unexpected departure of the director of Binance Brazil have been among a series of challenges for the world's largest crypto exchange by trading volume. Binance has faced intensifying regulatory scrutiny in several countries, including the U.K. and Japan.  According to a report in the New York Times on Thursday, Brooks resigned after a venture capital investment he was trying to complete to diversify the company’s ownership fell through.  The potential investors were concerned that U.S. authorities were investigating Binance over money laundering and tax issues, and also CEO Changpeng Zhao’s concentrated ownership of Binance.US. Zhao owns roughly 90% of Binance.US, according to the Times report.

According to the blockchain explorer website Etherscan, the top account by balance is Ethereum 2.0 with 6.9 million ETH ($21.3 billion worth). Wrapped ether (WETH) comes in second, holding 6.7 million ETH ($20.6 billion).      “The fact of the deposit contract overtaking the wrapped ether contract as No. 1 doesn't really mean anything in itself,” said Ben Edgington, lead product owner at ConsenSys. “It just shows that staking on Eth 2.0 is incredibly popular.”      This shows growing confidence the Ethereum Foundation is going to successfully complete the transition to Ethereum 2.0, said Tim Ogilvie, CEO of Staked, a firm that helps investors stake digital assets on Ethereum as well as on other blockchains including Cardano, Polkadot and Solana.      Wrapped ether is an ERC-20 compatible version of ether, allowing the token to be used in decentralized applications within the Ethereum ecosystem, according to Messari, a cryptocurrency data and analysis firm.      The Ethereum 2.0 contract ""is meant to move value into the Beacon Chain in order to secure it as a base layer on proof-of-stake, and then generate an interest rate on top algorithmically,” said Lex Sokolin, head economist at ConsenSys. The Beacon Chain will introduce proof-of-stake to Ethereum. The chain's role will change over time but is considered a foundational component for the security, sustainability and scalability towards which Ethereum is working.      “That capital is currently a one-way street until more bridges are built, tech matures or through derivative liquidity,” he added.      At press time, ether was trading at $3,082, based on CoinDesk 20 data.      “The 32 ETH deposit minimum for Eth 2.0 presents a barrier to stakers who have less than 32 ETH or prefer to hold liquid assets,” Nansen, a blockchain analytics firm, wrote in a report emailed to CoinDesk on Aug. 17. In order to become a full validator, users need to deposit a minimum of 32 ETH.      Therefore, some users might prefer to stake ETH through an exchange such as Binance or Kraken, or in liquid staking protocols like Lido or Ankr.      The report said that while Kraken and Binance continue to account for a significant proportion of the Ethereum 2.0 stake, they are losing share to alternative staking solutions like Lido, which is a decentralized staking pool.      In terms of tracked entities across multiple wallets, Kraken is the biggest depositor.    Read more: Polygon to Form Decentralized Autonomous Organization    “The rise of Lido marks a vast improvement in the distribution of network control.

Other participating investors included venture capital firm Kingsway Capital, Infinity Ventures Crypto, Atelier Ventures and the gaming entrepreneur Gabriel Leydon.  YGG describes itself as a ""play-to-earn gaming guild."" It allows gamers to earn tokens through blockchain-based economies.  Funding will be used by YGG to invest in digital assets in the play-to-earn games virtual world and to expand its community of over 48,000 gamers, said the firm in a press release.  “The intersection of crypto and gaming is one of the most exciting areas in tech today,” said Arianna Simpson, general partner at Andreessen Horowitz.  Simpson added YGG is at the center of the growing play-to-earn sector, ""where more of the value is retained by the players and community, rather than the gaming platforms.""  In August, YGG and cryptocurrency exchange FTX signed a sponsorship deal in which Axie Infinity players from developing countries will receive scholarship funds. The deal with FTX involves YGG loaning non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to players who cannot afford to buy their own, under a revenue-sharing agreement.

42397129,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaYnds,1629393857,'Block Kong': Dim Sum in a Crypto Hub,"The best way to see a city is to eat your way through it. And if you can’t do that – perhaps because of coronavirus restrictions – to read about someone else eating.      That’s the central conceit of Charles d'Haussy and Jame DiBiasio’s newish book, “Block Kong: 21 Entrepreneurs and Financiers Leading Blockchain in Hong Kong.” Over the course of several breakfast, lunch or dinner dates, prominent crypto leaders tell the story of a city and an industry in real time.      The authors do “kung fu tea” and dim sum with BitMEX’s Ben Delo, breakfast in the Happy Valley district of Hong Kong with Algorand’s Fangfang Chen, and croissants and Soylent over FTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried’s desk to set the record straight. (All sales proceeds are donated to fund the education of local engineers.)      A global center for finance, Hong Kong has become a major hub for the blockchain industry. It’s the home base for ultra-visible exchanges like FTX (and, at least for a spell, Binance), influential blockchain consortia like the Bitcoin Association and some of the sector’s largest investment groups, like Kenetic Capital.      “Hong Kong is an international financial center, so it's de facto becoming an international digital assets center,” d'Haussy said over Zoom, before the working day for him. “Even though there is not a strong appetite yet for bitcoin, per se, the economies and the laissez faire type of policies in Hong Kong provide a very rich ecosystem to grow here.”      But the city-state is also often overlooked and undervalued – at least in the Western media, d'Haussy says. According to recent statistics, Hong Kong has about one initial public offering (IPO) per day, 170 licensed banks, 600 stock-brokers and 7 million residents.      Technically a part of China since 1997, the city-state operates under its own financial and cultural rules. While President Xi Jinping has said it’s blockchain and not bitcoin for China, in Hong Kong, crypto thrives – from Block.one to Galaxy Digital.      “There is real radical diversity here,” d'Haussy said. “It all started with Bitcoin, of course, but there have always been subgroups within the crypto ecosystem.” He noted the first time Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin discussed smart contracts was at a Bitcoin meetup in the city.      Over the course of 183 pages, you get the sense that Hong Kong is not only a participant in crypto but at the forefront of some of the most revolutionary technological advancements in the sector.      Take CBDCs, or central bank digital currencies. The world is locked in a power struggle to determine which – if any – currency will become the next global reserve. Many experts and pundits now think digital when they think hegemony.      China has taken the lead in digitizing its renminbi, Europe is signaling a CBDC is imminent, while the U.S. is still taking a wait-and-see approach. Bitcoin is in the mix, as are other smaller national or regional digital currency projects.      D'Haussy, when he’s not chowing down or writing, oversees ConsenSys’ efforts to develop a multinational CBDC bridge among Hong Kong, Thailand, China and the United Arab Emirates, called m-CBDC. (ConsenSys is the Ethereum studio with a headquarters in a trendy corner of Brooklyn, N.Y.)      “Usually, you see CBDCs in silos for single domestic markets,” he said. The m-CBDC experiment speaks to the level of advancement and innovation happening in the East. Each central bank has its own monetary policies and regulations, reserve requirements and level of comfort with financial privacy.      Those are hard problems to solve, but it’s not surprising to see this innovation happening in Asia, particularly in Hong Kong, he said.    Read more: China’s Digital Yuan Blurs the Lines Between CBDCs and Crypto | Tanvi Ratna    “Asia in general adopts new technology way faster because of the appetite for new things, because they are a little bit more willing to take risks,” he said. For instance, digital and mobile payments have completely penetrated the market.      He also has a front-row seat to the development of the digital yuan. One of the prominent themes of the book is how the Facebook-led Libra (now Diem) experiment stirred China into action. Financial regulators the world over were immediately concerned with potential corporate influence over monetary policy – specifically a mega-corporation with a track record of privacy and other abuses.      Similar concerns have been raised over China’s nascent CBDC, which might come with built-in user restrictions and greater financial surveillance.      “You can’t get a shortcut around data privacy and privacy laws of your respective countries just because you’re using a CBDC,” d'Haussy said, noting that privacy is at least partially encoded by culture. The Chinese will develop whatever “they feel is in line with regulation for the domestic market.”      Elsewhere, the market will decide if it's comfortable with an international renminbi. “But I think the Chinese are very pragmatic and they will shape things so that it's supportive of [international law],” he said.      Added to this geopolitical currency conflict is the rise of stablecoins, or cryptocurrencies designed to hold their value relative to fiat. Given the speed of progress in crypto, it’s likely these coins will proliferate – especially in Asia.      With the choice of a U.S. dollar from the Federal Reserve, from Circle, from an exchange or from a bank, many Hong Kongers are choosing the stablecoin version. It’s a trend that may not last long, however.      “Innovation is going faster in the private sector than in central banks, so CBDCs are lagging behind. But in 2022, I believe CBDC volume will overtake stablecoins,” d'Haussy said. CBDCs have a “built-in value proposition” of being totally tax and regulatory compliant and integrated with the global banking community. Plus, with stablecoins, you have counterparty risk.      But blockchain will certainly have its place, even if “the ‘cryptocurrency use case is not something that is welcome in China,” he said. Specifically in the “Belt and Road” initiative, designed to help developing nations leapfrog phases of development and go directly into digital infrastructure and forge ties to the Communist state.      “The Chinese understand that blockchain is a collaboration technology and many different organizations are investing massively in that,” he said.    Read more: Crypto’s Connection to the Hong Kong Protests | Michael Casey    With China’s growing presence on the world stage, some have questioned how long Hong Kong could maintain its (semi) independence. Since before the turn of the century, Hong Kong has maintained its autonomy and ties to international capitalism with little interference from mainland China under the “one country, two systems” policy.      In June 2020, China passed a wide-ranging security law that limits the city’s residents’ right to demonstrate. Tensions have flared and the future of Hong Kong independence is now in question.      “There are changes in Hong Kong, like how things change after an election in the U.S. But the people remain here. Everyone is here, because this is where finance is happening,” d'Haussy said. “The changes happening are not breaking the sentiment, it's not breaking the energy.

42397119,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaYnT3,1629393136,Gary Gensler Isn't Buying Your Decentralization Theater,"In an interview published this morning in The Wall Street Journal, Securities and Exchange Commission head Gary Gensler declared that decentralized finance (DeFi) systems, which facilitate token trading on Ethereum and other smart contract blockchain platforms, could be subject to securities regulation. We’re definitely going to see thousands of anon plebs on Twitter and Telegram bloviating about how “you can’t regulate DeFi, it’s decentralized” and slamming Gensler as some sort of malicious know-nothing.      But the truth is that he’s saying out loud what most crypto insiders know all too well: the “De” in DeFi is, quite frequently, utter nonsense.    David Z. Morris is CoinDesk's chief insights columnist.    Close observers have warned for years that many crypto systems (not just in DeFi) are engaged in so-called “decentralization theater.” In principle, DeFi should share the uncensorability and irreversibility of a pure cryptocurrency like bitcoin, but this is rarely true.      Centralized administrators of systems can often be seen stepping in to mitigate or reverse hacks, for instance. The aftermath of the recent Poly Network hack has involved frequent and direct intervention from a centralized team, including the decision to offer the hacker amnesty and a $500,000 bounty for return of the funds.      Another classic example of decentralization theater is the practice of establishing ostensibly nonprofit “foundations” to manage a system. The implication of that structure was that a network was just sort of discovered in the wild and the Foundation is a disinterested third party that came along to nurture it. This is basically never what’s actually happening.      Another example, cited in the Journal piece but not by Gensler himself, is the issuance of “governance tokens” to the users of DeFi systems. These tokens nominally grant users the right to vote on decisions about how the system is administered. But in some cases, such as Blockchain Credit Partners, this is a pure ruse: The SEC alleges BCC issued governance tokens but was actually run by two men. In other cases, which would be more complex to adjudicate, governance rights may be genuinely distributed but not exercised, leaving power in the hands of a few by default.      The intent of decentralization theater has been, often and obviously, to blow dust into regulators’ faces, confusing them and slowing enforcement long enough to let a system grow – or, more cynically, long enough to fill some bags.    Read more: Gary Gensler Speaks. The Reviews From Crypto Aren’t Terrible | David Z. Morris    Gensler, as the kids say, sees what you did there. He told WSJ that the term “DeFi” is “a bit of a misnomer,” because “There’s still a core group of folks that are not only writing the software, like the open-source software, but they often have governance and fees,” Gensler said. “There’s some incentive structure for those promoters and sponsors in the middle of this.”      In theory, enforcement actions against DeFi systems would vary depending on these specific circumstances. A truly and solely code-based, open-source platform run by a community rather than a committee would have no central figures to prosecute, nor any “off switch” that could shut it down.      Gensler does actually seem to understand the distinction, which could be a huge boon for genuinely decentralized DeFi systems. But the hard truth is that the incentives in play suggest such instances are probably rare. Designing and maintaining DeFi systems is labor intensive and risky, but funneling system profits back to developers doing the work would very likely in itself undermine claims to decentralization.      As a result, DeFi in its current form wasn’t launched by a bunch of would-be Satoshi Nakamotos who gifted the world with their creations and then left them to fend for themselves. For the most part, they’re still around reaping profits and fixing bugs, and that chicken was always going to come home to roost eventually.      Edited 8.21.21: This essay previously referred to the Tezos Foundation as an example. Those familiar with the saga of the Tezos Foundation will know that this was anything but an example of decentralization theater.

Quintenz said that he expects to announce a role in the private sector after his departure from the CFTC. He told the Wall Street Journal that he plans to “keep innovation, particularly related to cryptocurrency and DeFi (decentralized finance), relevant to my career.”  If Quintenz moves into the crypto industry, it would follow a trend of former regulators taking leadership roles at crypto companies.  Quintenz, who was first nominated by then-President Obama and formally appointed in 2017 by then-President Trump, is one of only two Republicans on the five-seat CFTC. His absence will leave two empty seats on the commission; the other has been empty since the January departure of former Chairman Heath Tarbert.  President Biden reportedly plans to nominate acting Chairman Rostin Behnam, a Democrat, to officially lead the CFTC.  Quintenz’s term expired in April 2020, and he had previously committed to stepping down by last October, although he is legally allowed to remain on the commission through the end of this year. In the press release, however, he said that he opted to stay on given that there had been no replacement appointed, and to ""ensure my voice was heard as important derivatives market and financial innovation issues were raised during the administration’s transition.""  As crypto regulation tightens, crypto-friendly regulators such as Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Commissioner Hester Peirce and Quintenz have taken on an increasingly large burden of promoting crypto innovation and education at the government level.  During his tenure as a CFTC commissioner, Quintenz revived the commission’s nearly dormant Technology Advisory Committee (TAC), which had met only two times in the past three years before Quintenz re-organized it.

This can happen because of several reasons, one of which is burning coins. This can be a good thing, and we will detail how in the following article. But firstly, let&apos;s explain what burning coins mean. What Is the Coin Burning Process All About? The term &apos;burning a coin&apos; in the material world would mean that an investor is taking a zippo and burning tangible currency. Since digital cryptocurrencies exist only virtually, this is not possible. However, the idea is the one that counts. Coin burning is the action by which digital currency miners and developers can remove coins from circulation, reducing the total flow of that currency. So, the term burning is a bit misleading. The burnt coins still exist on the blockchain, but no one has access to them. How Can We Burn Coins? To remove coins and tokens from circulation, miners and developers are acquiring these coins. They are sending them to verifiably un-spendable addresses, which are unique addresses that have inaccessible private keys. Without access to the private keys, no one can use these coins or tokens, thus making these coins and tokens unusable. This reduces the circulation of coins and ensures that the network gets all incentives of the parties involved aligned. What Are the Benefits of Jax.Network? First, let&apos;s see what is burnt here and how on Jax....",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/tHfgumto13Drt0Pwos6IyYeLGixeGJZp,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png

42397113,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaYnN9,1629380706,Poly Network Sends Bounty as Attacker Holds $141M Hostage,"Poly Network, the China-based blockchain protocol exploited earlier this month for more than $600 million, said Thursday it had sent a bounty worth nearly $500,000 to the attacker and that most of the looted cryptocurrency has now been fully recovered.      But the attacker apparently has yet to provide a key needed to unlock the remaining $141 million.      ""There are users who are panicking that they might lose control of their assets, and we want to minimize the impact on them, so restoring our network and our users’ assets in a secure manner as quickly as possible is our top priority,"" the Poly Network team wrote early Thursday in an email.      The latest twist in the saga that began with the Aug. 10 exploit comes a day after the attacker, identified in the Ethereum-blockchain explorer website Etherscan as ""Poly Network Exploiter 1,"" threatened to delay the return of the funds until at least next week.      The hack is considered the biggest-ever in decentralized finance, (DeFi) and has highlighted the risks for cryptocurrency traders of using experimental software protocols that haven't been fully battle-tested. The transparency of blockchain data has turned the back-and-forth negotiations between the attacker and Poly Network team into a suspenseful drama playing out in public.    Bounty of 160 ETH transferred    The attacker previously had returned most of the looted digital assets to a special wallet set up for the purpose but had withheld a key needed to release them back to the Poly Network. The tokens include the dollar-linked stablecoins USDC and dai.      Late Wednesday, the Poly Network Exploiter 1 wallet address used a data field within a transaction on the Ethereum blockchain to send a message to the Poly Network team: ""PLEASE BE PATIENT. JUST SIGNED TRANSACTIONS OF USDC & DAI A FEW HOUR AGO.""      Meanwhile, the Poly Network team, in the email update on Thursday, pointed to a transaction record on Ethereum showing that some 160 units of the cryptocurrency ether, worth about $480,000 at current prices, had been sent to a wallet address identified as ""Poly Network Exploiter 2."" A related transaction record shows that the 160 ETH had been withdrawn from the Binance exchange on Aug. 12.      According to the email, the attacker, referred to by the Poly Network team as ""Mr. White Hat,"" has now returned assets worth about $427 million. Such assets include 96.9 million DAI ""received today,"" the team wrote.      ""We will convert the DAIs back to USDC to be used to recover the users’ assets, and we will compensate for any slippage loss incurred in the transactions with our own funds,"" the email said.      But a significant chunk of the funds has yet to be fully returned.      ""There are still 28,953 ETH and 1,032 WBTC (about $141 million) left in 3/4 multi-signature wallets for which we await Mr. White Hat to provide his private key authorization,"" the Poly Network team wrote. The wrapped bitcoin represents a version of bitcoin that's been digitally retrofitted to move on the Ethereum blockchain.      About 33 million of the dollar-linked stablecoin tether is frozen, according to Poly Network.      ""Poly Network is actively communicating with Tether on how to deal with this USDT is also a serious and careful decision making process for Tether,"" the Poly Network team wrote. ""We are confident there will be a clear result soon, as we need this assets in order to perform full asset recovery.""    'Mr. White Hat'    The attacker's motives remain unknown. The term ""white hat"" is typically used to denote an attacker who scouts for bugs or loopholes in the underlying code with the intent of helping developers plug any vulnerabilities. Bounties are often paid to these hackers as a gratuity for their contributions to the security of the network or protocol.      ""Although we did not receive a positive response from Mr. White Hat, we still fulfilled our promise and credited 160 ETH (worth about $500,000) to the address Mr. White Hat had made public,"" the Poly Network team wrote in the email.      The Poly Network project is gradually restarting suspended operations, with full functionality restored for at least 31 assets including binance coin (BNB), uniswap and shiba inu coin (SHIB), according to the team.      ""We will still proactively stay in communication with Mr. White Hat,"" Poly Network wrote in the email. ""We believe that the sooner we assure him that Poly Network is recovering with security as the top priority, and in an organized manner, the sooner we can gain his trust and eventually obtain his private key.""",NEUTRAL,ETH | SHIB | USDT | BNB,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | SHIB | USDT | BNB,Bradley Keoun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/19/poly-network-sends-bounty-as-attacker-holds-141m-hostage,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2e5527a6e9d6817185dbf7f3bc774dad75e004f9-1300x903.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Institutions and token holders can use Anchorage’s governance portal to participate in on-chain governance decisions critical to the Aave lending protocol. The system uses a separate voting key so that digital assets can remain safely in storage, the companies said Thursday.      Moving cryptocurrencies, especially from “cold” or offline storage, to online “hot” wallets, creates risk. Bringing offline digital assets on-chain in order to vote has been viewed as cumbersome and risky by many institutions holding governance tokens, despite the growing desire to participate in changes to a protocol, such as setting risk parameters, proposing upgrades and the like.      “Today we see large venture firms and crypto funds that are very active in the communities proposing changes to the protocol and using their own governance tokens to vote,” Anchorage co-founder Diogo Mónica said in an interview, adding:    “That’s something you didn’t really see a year and a half ago. There was value to holding these tokens, but people were just storing them in custody.”    Anchorage is starting with Aave but the broader selling point to the institutional DeFi market is the ability to have secure governance participation without exposing the keys themselves, he said.      “A lot of these protocols are following this process by which you can have one private key that holds the tokens and then another that is used for voting,” Mónica said. “We can delegate to some other key the ability to vote on these protocols. It’s a generalized capability that Anchorage has that’s going to be mimicked on many protocols.”      With over $14 billion in total locked value (TVL), Aave currently tops the leaderboard of DeFi platforms, according to DeFi Pulse.      “Democratizing access to Aave governance is key, and now more institutions will be able to participate in important protocol-level decisions thanks to Anchorage,” Aave founder Stani Kulechov said in a statement.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/08/19/custody-firm-anchorage-launches-governance-voting-with-defi-giant-aave,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b46d835a6a3de872b3650521e6e6f5bcc3b86dec-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42397099,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaYl8Q,1629365400,Crypto ETPs'  Fees Cost Up to 6 Times More Than Third-Party Custodians',"Institutional investors looking for cryptocurrency exposure should weigh the cost of remaining in their comfort zone.      German crypto custody firm Finoa crunched the numbers and found that fees for crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) cost four to six times more than fees for custodial services. Specifically, Finoa found that single-asset ETPs had an average (mean) fee of 1.8% and multi-asset ETPs had an average (mean) fee of 2.3%.      That means the expense ratio for a single-asset crypto ETP on average is 4.6 times more than that for a custodian, and a multi-asset ETP is six times as expensive, according to Finoa. Crypto ETPs give investors the ability to access the upside of the underlying assets without having to deal with the crypto itself.      A study of 14 institutional-grade crypto custody providers, including Anchorage, Bitcoin Coinbase and Gemini, found an average fee of 0.38% on a portfolio of $23.5 million.      “We’ve looked at the prices for all ETPs that are out there, and compared those with prices of the leading custodians globally. And there is this massive price difference,” said Marius Smith, Finoa’s head of business development, adding:    “It’s a cultural preference and not about price. A lot of these institutional investors are used to dealing with the same systems, asset managers and people that service them.”    Some 53 single-asset ETPs were included in the study. Those included products from Grayscale, 21Shares, WisdomTree, VanEck, ETC Group, Iconic Holding, Evolve ETFs, CoinShares, Purpose Investments, CI Global Asset Management, Bitwise, 3iQ, First Block Capital, Valour and Leonteq.      A further 13 multi-asset ETPs were included from such providers as Grayscale, 21Shares, FiCAS, Iconic Holding, Bitwise and 3iQ. (Grayscale and CoinDesk share a parent company, Digital Currency Group.)    Read more: Goldman Sachs Settling Crypto ETPs in Europe: Sources    Smith said Finoa has non-disclosure agreements with three or four large financial institutions and the mood is moving toward direct crypto exposure, given the possibility to put those assets to work on a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform, for example.      “We are definitely seeing the emergence of more index funds with multiple assets and so on, but none of them attract any real DeFi action,” Smith said in an interview. “An institution could buy a stablecoin and begin to earn interest, or get exposure to a proof-of-stake protocol. Putting those assets to work is something you can do through a custodian.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/08/19/crypto-etps-fees-cost-up-to-6-times-more-than-third-party-custodians,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7a31956cbb7270d5c994a2427da4ff86a31f393f-1500x983.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is down 2% on the day after reaching a 24-hour high of around $45,986, CoinDesk data show. At press time, bitcoin was changing hands at around $44,400.      Bitcoin has fallen squarely back below its 200-day moving average, invalidating a breakout on Aug. 13.      ""We still have support at $44,000 and $42,000, which is the line in the sand for short-term momentum,"" Jon de Wet, chief investment officer at digital asset firm Zerocap, told CoinDesk via Telegram.      The firm pointed toward flows to safe-haven assets in light of the instability in Afghanistan that was sparked by the exit of the U.S. military as well as concerns over the COVID-19 Delta variant.      Headwinds in China, with its slowing economy and tech sector crackdown, are also affecting the crypto markets, but so far, the Liquid hack having little impact. That's a sign of continuing bullish sentiment, the firm noted.      ""A daily break below $42,000 would place some confidence in the bears, but on balance, we believe [the] price will hold above this level over the coming week,"" de Wet said.      On-chain indicators point to bitcoin holding above that level, at least in the short-term, as so-called smart money flows out of exchanges continue to reign supreme, Glassnode data show.      Generally, ""smart money"" dominates exchange flows, according to Zerocap. If bitcoin is leaving exchanges, it can indicate an intention to hold. Conversely, when bitcoin moves onto exchanges, it can indicate an intention to sell.      ""Ethereum even more so, with exchange balances hitting an all-time low this week,"" de Wet said. ""Leverage is not excessive in this market right now – all very supportive of a buoyant week ahead, despite the macroeconomic landscape.""

The main idea one needs to follow in a video marketing campaign is to build a story around the product that they are trying to sell or want to get more leads on. According to a study conducted by Animoto in 2015, people who watch a promotional video are more likely to buy the product or the service than non-viewers. In this article, we talk about how using video marketing techniques and tricks for a cryptocurrency exchange builds its customer community and increases the sales of its services. What Are Cryptocurrency Exchanges? Before we move any further and talk about video marketing, let&apos;s shed a little light on the concept of a cryptocurrency exchange business.

Now, we&apos;ve reached a point where blockchain has matured significantly—it&apos;s no longer relegated to the hobby projects of a decade ago. Rather, startups to Fortune 500 firms around the world are adopting blockchain, and DeFi is now a $100 billion sector that has grown 88x in just 1 year. Of course, blockchain is much more than just DeFi. It&apos;s also powering around $2 trillion worth of cryptocurrencies and even virtual worlds like Next Earth. With that said, let&apos;s hone in on DeFi, and look at 5 solutions that&apos;ll blow your mind. 1) Uniswap Uniswap is a decentralized trading protocol that doesn&apos;t require trust.

According to a tweet on Thursday, the exchange said its warm wallets were compromised and that it was moving digital assets offline.  While the total amount stolen has yet to be determined, the value taken in bitcoin, ether, ripple, tron, and others could be upward of $90 million, Eddie Wang, senior researcher at OKLink, told CoinDesk.  ""We are currently investigating and will provide regular updates,"" the exchange said in the tweet. ""In the meantime, deposits and withdrawals will be suspended.""  In a later tweet, Liquid Global said it's working with other exchanges to freeze the funds.  Crypto exchange KuCoin's CEO, Johnny Lyu, said his platform was aware of the incident and had blacklisted the hacker's wallet addresses. Other exchanges are likely to follow suit.  So far, it has revealed nine wallet addresses where the hacker is depositing heisted funds.  One of the addresses Liquid Global revealed was still receiving bitcoin at 7:20 UTC  In a blog post on the incident, translated from the Japanese by Google, Liquid Global claimed the hack targeted a multi-party computation (MPC) wallet. ""This time, the MPC wallet (used for warehousing / delivery management of cryptographic assets) used by our Singapore subsidiary QUOINE PTE was damaged by hacking."" the company said.  MPC is an advanced cryptographic technique in which the private key controlling funds is generated collectively by a set of parties, none of whom can see the fragments calculated by the others.

Revenue was $6.5 billion for the quarter, the company said in its earnings release Wednesday, an net income almost quadrupled to $2.37 billion from a year earlier.  To combat the global shortage supply of its cards, Nvidia announced the rollout of its Cryptocurrency Mining Processors in February, specifically targeting crypto miners.  While sales of its graphics processing units helped drive revenue, Nvidia fell short of its forecast of generating $400 million in revenue in the quarter from mining-related cards. Sales of Nvidia's crypto mining-related products totaled $266 million, the company reported.  Revenue from its data center and professional visualization platforms rose 35% and 156% respectively from the second quarter a year ago, while its gaming revenue increased 85%.

42397096,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaYl3V,1629344026,Coinbase Names Mitsubishi UFJ as Banking Partner in Japan,"U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase is forming a partnership with one of Japan's largest banks to launch Coinbase Japan as part of a larger effort to expand worldwide.      Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), a bank with more than 40 million Japanese customers, will provide ""MUFG Quick Deposit"" for Coinbase's local users, according to a blog post on Wednesday,      The move into Japan follows a green light from the country's financial regulators, who have looked sternly at the crypto industry in recent years.      Japanese customers using Coinbase can buy bitcoin, ether, stellar, litecoin and bitcoin cash, with other listings to follow, CoinDesk previously reported. An exact date of the Coinbase Japan launch has not yet been given.      The move follows the Nasdaq-listed exchange's subsidiary registering with the Financial Services Agency (FSA), the country’s financial watchdog, in June. Coinbase said its partnership with the bank was a bid to become the country's ""most trusted exchange"" that is ""fully compliant.""      Japan's crypto regulations have been strict. The hardline from regulators stems from the fallout from a number of exchange hacks that have occurred in the country over the years, including a hack of Coincheck in 2017.      Following the hacks, the FSA and self-regulatory rules promoted by the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association have only increased in scope, scrutiny and intensity.      Some crypto exchanges such as Kraken initially left the country in 2018, citing rising costs as a result of red tape. The exchange has since returned to the jurisdiction as of September 2020 following licensure to its Japanese subsidiary, Payward Asia Ltd.
